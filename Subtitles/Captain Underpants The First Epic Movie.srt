<i>in a galaxy far, faraway...</i>

00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,848

<i>That's perfect.
That's perfect. Okay.</i>

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,408
<i>Underpantyworld was</i>
a <i>peaceful planet</i>

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,682
<i>where everybody wore
only underwear.</i>

<i>Until it started to blow up

16
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,363
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Da-da.

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,682
<i>Meanwhile, the leaders

<i>Big Daddy Longiohns and his

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,689
<i>by stretching his underwear
really far...</i>

21

<i>and then
they shot him into space.</i>

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,964
Godspeed, little Underpants.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,161
Wheel

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,646
Wheel

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,126
<i>And then he crashed on Earth,</i>

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,884
<i>where he was raised
by some nice...</i>

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,681
<i>Dolphins?</i>

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,530
<i>Yeah, dolphins.
Just go with it.</i>

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,806
Okay, fine.

30
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,336
Goo-goo, gah-gah.

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,203
Tra-la-la-la-la-Ia.

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,364
<i>But the space baby grew up fast.</i>

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,049
Look! Up in the sky!

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,725
It's a bird!
It's a plane!

35
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,121
It's an egg salad sandwich.

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,408
And guess what? I'm rotten.

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,731
Faster than
a speeding waistband.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,881
More powerful

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,684
- than boxer shorts.
- Yay!

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,651
You'll never catch me,
Captain Underpants.

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,529
Owie.

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,082
Able to leap tall buildings
without getting a wedgie.

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,809
Hey, all right.
Good for you, pal.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,923
Now put on some clothes,
you weirdo.

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,321
No way.

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,569
I fight for truth, justice,

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,881
and all that is
pre-shrunk and cottony.

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,485
For I am...

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,922
Captain Underpants!

50
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,011
The origin issue.

51
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,084
It's so good. We should've
done an origin issue ages ago.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,924
Yeah, like, first.

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,736
You know, I'm not sure
about the dolphins, though.

54
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,921
Yeah, I know. It's just...

55
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,136
I didn't know if it was
the thing where it's,

56
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,685
like, good weird or bad weird.

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,560
Like, is it something...

58
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,011
The origin issue!

59
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,964
I've told you two
a thousand times

60
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,764
not to draw
these idiotic comics!

61
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,921
Freeze!

62
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,282
Hey, everybody!
Wait one second.

63
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,680
Hi. I'm George Beard.

64
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,256
And this is my best friend,
Harold Hutchins.

65
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,770
Hey. Ah, man.

66
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,610
It's okay. We got more ideas.

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,201
See, Harold loves to draw
and I love to tell stories.

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,203
And this old guy looking angry
right here...

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,442
well, this is the worst
principal in the world...

70
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,641
Mr. Krupp.

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,609
Mean old Mr. Krupp.

72
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,410
Hates anything fun.

73
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,045
Like comic books...

74
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,201
recess...

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,881
Christmas.

76
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,246
Ho, ho, whoa!

77
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,321
Even kittens!

78
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,324
Oh, my goodness.
Did that really happen?

79
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,323
Uh, no, not technically.

80
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,970
But it might <i>as</i> well have!

81
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,762
I'm sorry.
I'm still mad about the comic.

82
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,160
Yeah, me too.

83
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,726
And unfreeze.

84
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,121
In my office, now!

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,450
What is happening right now?

86
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,005
I don't know.

87
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,040
Do you think he fell
asleep with his eyes open?

88
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,526
Maybe. Let's try and leave
and see what happens.

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,328
Door lock activated.

90
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,642
Wow. That's an expensive door.

91
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,485
It was a choice between the
magnetic automatic door closer...

92
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,961
and the music and arts programs.

93
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,440
Pretty sure
I made the right choice.

94
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,524
This morning's school sign
is supposed to read...

95
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,445
"Sewage plant field trips
are today."

96
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,282
So can either of you explain
why it now reads...

97
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,205
"Come see my hairy armpits?"

98
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,725
I know you two are responsible.

99
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,856
How? How do you know?
Do you have any proof?

100
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,200
I mean,
this is a country of laws.

101
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,327
The proof is here.

102
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,561
Inside my gut.

103
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,563
He must have
a lot of proof in there.

104
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,724
Quiet fives.
Quiet fives.

105
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,801
Hmm.

106
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,167
Ever since you attended
this elementary school...

107
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,403
you've been responsible
for one prank after another.

108
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,324
Shh...

109
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,766
Wow, that's a lot of pranks.

110
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,604
Yeah, when it's cut
all together like that,

111
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,091
you really get a sense
of the scope.

112
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,056
Some of those must've been
really hard to pull off.

113
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,889
And dangerous.
Like that tiger'

114
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,280
Oh, that tiger was crazy.

115
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,442
For four long years...

116
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,656
you two have been disrupting

117
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,889
the carefully calibrated,
drone-like beehive...

118
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,890
that this elementary school
is supposed to be.

119
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,768
I may not be able
to prove it yet...

120
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,361
but I'm gonna get you two
one day.

121
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,967
One day very, very soon.

122
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,124
All right.
Fair enough.

123
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,284
Get out of my office. Now!

124
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,091
You see what we're up against?

125
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,971
And that's just a typical day
at Jerome Horwitz Elementary.

126
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,811
More like
Jerome Horwitz Penitentiary.

127
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,286
<i>Hey, guys-</i>

128
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,487
What's going on, Tommy?

129
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,324
Same old, same old.

130
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,449
Poor kid.

131
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,489
Time to have fun with history.

132
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,642
Memorize these dates.

133
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,569
1827,1853,1914,1926.

134
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,643
First graders.
Always hits them the hardest.

135
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,330
Hold on a sec.

136
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,968
So that's why we do what we do.

137
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,009
He's left us no choice.

138
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,571
Our pranks and practical jokes

139
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,250
are the last line of defense...

140
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,006
against the injustice
of our terrible principal.

141
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,685
Well, well, well.

142
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,241
I heard you both got into

143
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,845
a bit of the old trouble today.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,120
How'd you hear that, Melvin?

145
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,844
Did you tattle-tale on us?

146
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,002
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

147
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,600
<i>I did.</i>

148
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,285
Someone has to
stand up for the Man.

149
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,522
No one has to
stand up for the Man.

150
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,125
That's the whole point
of the Man.

151
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,850
He stands up
for himself, Melvin.

152
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,371
Respectfully disagree.

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,856
Attention, everyone.

154
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,016
Principal <i>Krupp</i> here

155
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,121
<i>with an announcement.</i>

156
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,205
<i>This Saturday ts the mandatory
Invention Convention.</i>

157
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,486
Boo!
Oh, what?

158
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,601
Yes!

159
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,330
That's our third Saturday
this month!

160
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,808
<i>You must he here with
your inventions at 8:00 am.</i>

161
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,360
Is there no justice?

162
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,687
<i>I know that's early
for Saturday, but don't worry.</i>

163
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,000
<i>You should be done by 9:00...</i>

164
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,041
<i>Pm</i>

165
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,401
Tree house?

166
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,561
Tree house.

167
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,923
Welcome to
the world headquarters

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,923
of Tree House Comix, Inc.

169
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,765
Yep. This is
where the magic happens.

170
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,206
Not, like, actual magic.

171
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,125
No, we're not
practicing the dark arts.

172
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,006
No, here we just hang out
and make comics

173
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,451
and try to
make each other laugh.

174
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,764
That's how we became friends.

175
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,091
This is me in kindygarten.

176
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,766
And this is me.

177
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,251
George and I aren't friends yet.

178
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,401
But we're about to be.

179
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,360
The seventh planet
from the sun is called...

180
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,565
Uranus.

181
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,407
Scientists refer to Uranus...

182
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,050
Your anus.

183
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,456
As one of the planets...

184
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,970
I know.

185
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,161
Known as a gas giant.

186
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,727
I don't get it.
It's just science, guys.

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,331
As I was saying...

188
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,561
Hey, I'm George. You wanna

189
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,976
hang out in my tree house
after school?

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,286
You have a tree house?

191
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,324
Ever since then, we've created
hundreds of comics in here.

192
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,324
<i>Like the Wrath of
the Wicked Wedgie Woman.</i>

193
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,960
And who could forget Sad Worm?

194
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,009
It was a worm who was sad.

195
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,926
That one's
still a work in progress.

196
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,082
But the all-time
greatest superhero

197
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,288
that we've ever created was...

198
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,083
<i>The Amazing Captain Underpants.</i>

199
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,287
See, most superheroes look like

200
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,203
they're flying around
in their underwear.

201
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,170
Well, this guy actually does.

202
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,123
Come on, let's get to work.

203
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,885
Hey, tell me what you think.

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,889
Oh, I can't wait to draw this.

205
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,201
Tra-la-laaa!

206
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,964
Wait, wait.
Don't move, don't move.

207
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,686
Mr. Hutchins, I gotta say...

208
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,336
your drawings get better
with every issue.

209
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,045
Because your words
inspire greatness, Mr. Beard.

210
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,321
Good night, Harold.

211
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,527
Good night, George.

212
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,851
I love Saturday

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,004
<i>When anything is possible</i>

214
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,240
<i>I love Saturday</i>

215
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,882
<i>'Cause I can wear

216
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,364
<i>I love Saturday</i>

217
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,882
<i>'Cause I can watch
TV all day Day</i>

218
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,249
<i>I can pee a little bit
in my underwear</i>

219
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,206
<i>And no one will mind</i>

220
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,696
Where are you going with that?
Do you really do that?

221
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,290
No. What are you talking...

222
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,523
It's just something
I could do because...

223
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,843
<i>Monday's an eternity away</i>

224
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,607
<i>when it is Saturday Saturday</i>

225
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,016
Get in the car, boys.

226
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,963
You've got the
Invention Convention today.

227
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,600
This thing on?

228
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,890
<i>Quick announcement.</i>

229
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,804
<i>Our science teacher, Mr. Fyde,
is no longer with us.</i>

230
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,241
He's dead?

231
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,767
<i>What? No. Not like that.</i>

232
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,809
<i>He wanted to spend Saturday
with his family.</i>

233
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,166
<i>So I fired him.</i>

234
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,765
<i>I'll find a replacement
next week.</i>

235
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,285
<i>Ahem! Anyway.'-</i>

236
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,331
<i>on to Melvin Sneedly

237
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,444
Actually, it's 17.

238
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,170
<i>17 inventions.</i>

239
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,651
<i>Take it away, Melvin.</i>

240
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,401
<i>I will now demonstrate
a prototype which I call...</i>

241
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,961
<i>the Robotic Sock Matcher.</i>

242
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,644
<i>Never waste time matching
your own socks again.</i>

243
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,802
<i>The Electromagnetic
Lint Collector.</i>

<i>Digital Paper Sorter.</i>

<i>It's the homework...
Automatic cushion.</i>

246
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,486
Make it end!

247
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,167
<i>And the personal favorite,
the binder binder.</i>

248
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,840
<i>Having trouble
organizing your binders?</i>

249
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,005
<i>Well, look no further
than this giant binder...</i>

250
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,326
<i>for binders.</i>

251
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,336
Three-hole punch...

252
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,850
This is the stuff of nightmares.

253
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,456
We have to do
something about this.

254
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,723
I don't know. Krupp looks
serious this time, George.

255
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,416
Maybe we should
just lay low for a while.

256
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,205
Lay low?
Look at our fellow children.

257
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,807
Look upon their sad,
miserable, pathetic faces.

258
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,326
Come on, Harold.

259
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,656
If you won't do it for me
and you won't do it for you...

260
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,409
do it for future generations.

261
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,005
Save the first graders...

262
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,889
the kindygarteners,
the unborn...

263
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,883
from a life of eternal boredom!

264
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,890
Okay, let's do this.

265
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,208
<i>Feast your eyes on this.</i>

266
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,682
<i>The Turbo Toilet 20001.!</i>

267
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,480
<i>Check it out, people.</i>

268
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,721
<i>It's already programmed with</i>

269
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,960
<i>my persona! potty playlist.</i>

270
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,801
Screwdriver.

271
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,881
<i>Oh, samba!</i>

272
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,760
<i>Once you're done
using the facilities...</i>

273
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,726
<i>hit the button
and let my toilet wash itself.</i>

274
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,160
<i>Now included, automatic
toilet paper wiping claw.</i>

275
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,890
<i>Trademark.</i>

276
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,081
<i>Um...</i>

277
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,241
I said no!

278
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,921
Huh? Oh...

279
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,565
Melvin, turn that thing off.

280
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,929
I'm trying to,
but it's not cooperating.

281
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,801
Best.
Prank.

282
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,961
Ever.

283
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,925
Well, that brings our story
to its happy conclusion.

284
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,520
I hope you've all
enjoyed the film.

285
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,289
It was certainly shorter
than we expected.

286
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,641
What more is there to say?

287
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,007
Our fellow students got
to enjoy their weekend.

288
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,323
Which, by the way,
they are legally entitled to.

289
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,324
And good triumphed over evil
once and for...

290
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,326
Oh, boys! A moment, please.

291
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,725
What's happening to his face?

292
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,207
I think he's smiling.

293
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,044
I'm so cold.

294
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,562
So, <i>so</i> cold.

295
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,041
I'll let myself in,
receptionist lady.

296
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,681
Melvin.

297
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,886
What's he doing here?

298
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,203
You see, Melvin
is yet to demonstrate...

299
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,011
his most impressive invention
from today.

300
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,441
It was a little
extracurricular project

301
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,727
I asked him
to come up with myself.

302
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,690
I call him
the Tattle Turtle 200.

303
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,525
On the outside,
it resembles a turtle.

304
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,365
But on the inside,
oh, look at this.

305
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,521
<i>It's a nanny cam!</i>

306
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,961
Oh, Melvin. How fun.

307
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,043
Let's see what it recorded.

308
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,883
Yeah, you gotta change
the input to video.

309
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,041
I think I got this.

310
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,611
You're on AUX.
Change it to video.

311
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,807
It's not my TV.

312
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,216
It's your turtle.
You're doing it wrong.

313
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,321
I know.

314
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,926
I think I know
how to do my office.

315
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,846
<i>Screwdriver.</i>

316
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,805
<i>Is this two-ply or one-WI?</i>

317
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,085
<i>We're so guilty.</i>

318
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,011
<i>Quiet fives. Quiet fives.</i>

319
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,285
Wow, that nanny cam

320
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,765
really has good picture quality.

321
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Was that hi-def?

322
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,167
'Cause you could
really tell that's us.

323
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,802
I can't believe it.
I gotcha.

324
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,411
I finally gotcha!

325
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,082
We've finally got them, sir.

326
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,084
Yes, yes. Well done, Melvin.
Extra credit granted.

327
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,083
Put that in my pocket.

328
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,321
Extra credit, it feels so good!

329
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,289
<i>I</i> go! extra credit

330
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,488
I told you
I would get you one day.

331
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,291
And that day I was talking about

332
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,600
is this day.

333
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,127
Today. This is the day.

334
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,976
Are you going to tell
our parents?

335
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,446
No. Your parents are obviously
total failures.

336
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,161
I have a much more effective
punishment in mind.

337
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,803
Because I'm going to have
you two placed in separate...

338
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,281
classes.

339
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,976
I'm going to annihilate
your friendship.

340
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,001
What? No!

341
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,204
You see?
You won't be together.

342
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,204
You won't be able to enjoy

343
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,726
each other's company
and ruin my life.

344
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,201
Mr. Krupp, no.
You can't do this. Please.

345
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,482
This is too much.
I mean, even for you.

346
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,642
Enjoy the rest
of your weekend, boys.

347
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,484
Because come Monday...

348
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,210
Separate classes.
Our friendship's over.

349
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,850
I'll never see you again
in my life!

350
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,650
Hey, hey. Calm down.

351
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,080
It's not the end of the world.

352
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,366
We'll still be best friends.

353
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,847
Just way down the hall
from each other.

354
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,001
What am I talking about?
This is bad.

355
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,083
Long distance relationships
never work!

356
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,330
This is just the beginning.

357
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,170
Imagine the future.

358
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,001
<i>Friends separated...</i>

359
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,722
<i>promising each other
they'll remain besties.</i>

360
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,291
<i>But within months,</i>

361
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,681
<i>we'll be awkwardly bumping
into each other at the mall.</i>

362
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,211
Hey, George.

363
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,044
Hey. Do I know you?

364
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,964
<i>You'll have a weird haircut.</i>

365
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,282
<i>I'll be wearing
a suit for some reason.</i>

366
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,566
<i>And before we know it,</i>

367
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,560
<i>separate classes
will lead to separate lives...</i>

368
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,648
<i>which inevitably
leads to robots.</i>

369
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,562
What? Why are there robots
at the mall?

370
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,121
Because this is the future!
The future always has robots.

371
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,765
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

372
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,803
Why are the robots
shooting other robots?

373
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,320
Aren't they
supposed to be friends?

374
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,441
I don't know!

375
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,696
I'm the artist,
you're the writer.

376
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,960
That's why we need each other.

377
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,086
Help! Fire!

378
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,402
Okay, you're right.
No, you are right.

379
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,324
I mean, if we get put
in separate classes,

380
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,129
it's the end of the world
as we know it.

381
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,441
What are we gonna do?

382
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,443
Oh, I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

383
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,610
First thing Monday morning,
we're getting that turtle.

384
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,281
Edith!

385
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,965
Oh, is this a bad time?

386
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,765
I did not mean to interrupt
the copying process.

387
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,921
I'll go.

388
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,160
Yes, go! Please go.

389
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,368
No, no. I'm just finishing up.

390
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,120
What brings you around here?

391
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,446
I just made
this tuna casserole...

392
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,126
and I noticed
it had your name on it...

393
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,601
In jalapeño peppers.

394
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,006
Mmm...

395
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,282
It smells spicy.

396
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,965
Yep. Mmm-hmm.

397
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,282
That's 'cause it's been
dry-aged for a week.

398
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,851
I don't know what that means,

399
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,450
but it sounds
very time-consuming.

400
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,971
It took a week.

401
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,646
Eww. They like each other.

402
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,643
Oh, no, George.
I think it's much worse.

403
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,529
They like-like each other.

404
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,761
What are you talking about?

405
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,569
Adults don't
like-like other adults.

406
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,336
Well, you probably haven't
seen it at your home

407
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,600
since your parents are married.

408
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,325
In my studies, like-liking
seems to end with marriage.

409
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,776
Well, I should probably gel
back to running the school.

410
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,609
You know,
it's not gonna run itself.

411
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,366
But...

412
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,883
Oh, Edith. Get your head
out of the clouds.

413
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,083
Wait, Edith! You never gave me
the tuna casserole.

414
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,689
I think he forgot the turtle.

415
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,080
Go, go, go-

416
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,686
That's important.

417
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,410
Great. What now?

418
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,206
<i>Hello.
If you would like the chance</i>

419
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,169
<i>to win one billion dollars...
Ooh.</i>

420
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,089
Please hold for
one of our representatives.

421
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,089
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

422
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,041
Ugh.

423
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,531
Whoa!
What?

424
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,887
Everything Krupp
ever confiscated from us.

425
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,724
Look at all that stuff.

426
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,649
Oh, dear old whoopee cushion.

427
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,564
You will sing once again.

428
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,568
Oh, my
Super Duper Soaking Machine!

429
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,281
MY hypno-ring!

430
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,482
I never even got to take it
out of the wrapper.

431
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Wow.

432
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,561
Look at this.

433
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,256
He's got every issue
of Captain Underpants

434
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,327
we've ever created.

435
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,481
You think he reads them?

436
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,856
I was kinda hoping
that we appealed

437
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,609
to a slightly
cooler demographic.

438
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,009
Well, if it isn't George Beard
and Harold Hutchins.

439
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,162
To what do I owe the pleasure?

440
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,084
Is it perhaps this?

441
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,321
Oh, no.

442
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,641
Nice try.

443
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,763
Turtle and I have grown
quite attached.

444
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,570
We're inseparable, actually.

445
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,250
I carry him wherever I go.

446
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,687
Including the shower!

447
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,965
<i>Oh.
Poor 'name.</i>

448
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,931
Oh, what's this?

449
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,921
Why, it's the paperwork

450
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,923
to separate you two.

451
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,321
It's really incredible.

452
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,922
I can actually see
the end of your friendship.

453
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,447
And it ends right here.

454
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,602
On this dotted line.

455
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,805
George, do something.

456
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,010
Put the pen down, Mr. Krupp...

457
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,525
or we'll hypnotize you.

458
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,681
What?
What?

459
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,001
You said do something.

460
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,207
What is that?

461
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,001
Forged from the molten
plastic of Shandong, China.

462
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,640
<i>In the lowest floor
of the darkest basement</i>

463
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,804
<i>where only toy prizes
dare be made...</i>

464
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,803
<i>exists the most powerful item...</i>

465
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,362
<i>ever to be found in a box
of Frosted Sugar Doodles.</i>

466
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,963
The hypno-ring.

467
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,646
Hypnotize me?

468
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,529
With that piece of plastic junk?

469
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,881
Does that really work?

470
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,008
What do you think?
I got it out of a cereal box.

471
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,241
I'm warning you.

472
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,456
If you don't do what we say,

473
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,720
you're gonna get really sleepy.

474
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,411
Oh, will I?
I'll get sleepy?

475
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,210
With that thing pointing at me'?

476
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,010
It's not making me sleepy.

477
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,729
I'm not gonna get sleepy from...

478
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,921
Whoa!

479
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,366
What kind of
plastic hokum is this?

480
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,646
Whoa!

481
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,016
What's happening?
I don't know.

482
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,690
Why are we floating?

483
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,171
What was that?

484
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,441
I don't know.

485
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,160
I honestly didn't think
that would happen.

486
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,211
Gotcha. You're safe now,
little turtle.

487
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,051
<i>When I snap my fingers,</i>

488
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,884
you will obey our every command.

489
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,371
Wait. How do you know this?

490
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,656
I don't know.
I just say the first thing

491
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,336
that comes to my mind
with great authority.

492
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,522
You are now a chicken.

493
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,561
N worked!

494
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,281
He's a chicken.

495
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,720
Okay, let me try. Let me try.

496
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,806
You're a monkey.

497
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,722
Oh! Look at him,
he's a monkey!

498
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Come on.

499
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,726
You are now

500
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,730
the greatest superhero
of all time...

501
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,526
the amazing Captain Underpants!

502
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,045
Tra-la-laaaaa!

503
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,922
Captain Underpants?
Is that really you?

504
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,686
Let's see.

505
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,604
Underpants, check.

506
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,967
Captain, also check.

507
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,369
I'm pretty sure
I'm Captain Underpants.

508
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,641
It worked!

509
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,451
Which must make you
my trusty sidekicks!

510
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,841
Sidekicks?

511
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,648
Fear not, this planet is safe
under my watchful eye.

512
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,450
This is hilarious!
This is amazing!

513
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,960
Let's see what's afoot.

514
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,121
Wait, no!

515
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,803
Well, that was invigorating.

516
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,485
We gotta stop him.
Why?

517
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Huzzah!

518
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,801
Out of the road, bozo!

519
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,689
Why, thank you, vehicle person!

520
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,927
Ow!

521
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,525
Yeah, we should
probably go get him.

522
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,282
Captain Underpants, wait!

523
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,691
Oh!
Ha-ha!

524
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,081
What is this?

525
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,529
Poor soul. You're trapped

526
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,484
in some sort of
invisible box-like prison.

527
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,086
What's that? I can't hear you.

528
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,924
But I see your tears.

529
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,162
Is it okay
that I'm kinda loving this?

530
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,163
Yes and no. But mostly yes.

531
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,002
Fear not
for I will set you free!

532
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,081
Ow!
Ooh!

533
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,326
What is wrong with you?

534
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,170
Ah, that's better.
I can hear you now.

535
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,045
Sorry, sorry. We're so sorry.

536
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,240
Okay, listen, let's not be

537
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,656
punching people,
though, because...

538
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,011
Hold n.

539
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,365
Here, let me help.
Oh!

540
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,363
You're welcome, madam.

541
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,856
You know,
we should probably get you

542
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,496
back to the school
before anything else...

543
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,521
Halt!
What?

544
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,364
Do you sense that?
No.

545
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,567
Well, of course you don't.

546
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,205
You're not a superhero like me.

547
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,601
Come, sidekicks.
Evil lurks within!

548
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,761
Oh, no!

549
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,725
Where'd he go now?

550
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,968
To the sky!

551
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,296
You'd think a guy like him
would be easy to find.

552
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
Found him.

553
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,966
Stand down,
you giant ape monster!

554
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,771
Giant ape monster?
What is he talking...

555
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,722
Your days of terrifying
this town are over!

556
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,644
Mr. Krupp!
I mean, Captain Underpants!

557
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,246
You can't actually fly!

558
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,323
Now I take to the sky...

559
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,606
like an ostrich!

560
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,130
<i>I</i> gotcha!

561
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,610
We gotta do something.

562
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,086
I've got an idea.

563
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,445
Morning.
Morning.

564
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,489
Oh, that is a lot of buttons.

565
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,761
Take that! Ah, cheap shot!

566
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,929
Ow! Right in the kisser!

567
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,481
No!

568
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,761
Oh, hi, guys!

569
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,967
Wait! No!

570
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,367
Follow that gorilla!

571
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,283
Oh, you put up a good fight!

572
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,364
Yeah! You are so good
at operating a crane, Harold.

573
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,284
I know!
It's really not that hard.

574
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,160
Rest assured,

575
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,850
citizens of
this marvelous metropolis...

576
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,651
I will rid you of this menace
any moment now!

577
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,650
Come on. Oh, come on,
come on, come on.

578
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,006
Victory!

579
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,446
Yes!
Bravo!

580
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,880
Oh, no, no, no!

581
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,162
Let that be a lesson
to evildoers everywhere.

582
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,489
Never underestimate the power
of underwear!

583
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,404
Who the heck are you?

584
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
What the...

585
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,485
Wow! I can't believe
we found a spot.

586
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,041
Oh, goodness.
Grandpa, you did it again.

587
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,641
He's a sleepwalker.

588
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,882
Come on, pap pap,
let's get you back into bed.

589
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,724
But what about all the other
evil villains?

590
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,126
Well, don't worry about that.

591
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,840
There's no more
evil villains around here.

592
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,850
A science teacher, hmm?

593
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,002
The perfect cover.

594
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,842
Chums! What
an astounding headquarters.

595
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,889
Stuffed full of relics...

596
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,249
all celebrating
my interplanetary exploits!

597
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,004
Oh, this takes me back.

598
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,408
What are we gonna do?
He can't just stay here.

599
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,085
We have to turn him back
into Krupp.

600
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,810
I know,
but can we just take a moment

601
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,600
to acknowledge
what's happening here please?

602
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,566
I mean, Captain Underpants is
hanging out in our tree house!

603
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,089
Look at the cute little turtle.

604
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,929
Oh, he's so adorable.

605
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,090
Well, a hero's work
is never done.

606
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,362
Now it is time to fly again!

607
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,806
No, no, no, no!

608
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,641
Where am I?

609
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,086
Where are my pants?

610
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,287
Oh, no! He's Krupp again.

611
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,771
Ah!

612
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,730
Tra-la-laaa!

613
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,960
That's it! Now we know
what turns him hack and forth.

614
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,201
Turns who what?

615
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,721
Why am I soaking wet?

616
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,041
Cool.
Hey.

617
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,890
Tra-la-laaa!

618
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,929
Harold!
Tra-Ia...

619
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,809
George!
Laaa!

620
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,121
We should probably stop.

621
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,406
Yeah, we probably should.

622
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,403
Stop doing this!
Tra-la...

623
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,130
I am Captain...

624
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,576
What are you doing?

625
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,601
Hello? Well, hello!

626
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,569
What's happening?
Fear not!

627
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,376
Didn't know I could do this.
Hey, sidekicks!

628
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,811
Tra! Hey! Heyo!

629
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,001
Tra-la-laaa!

630
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,125
Okay, this is the street.

631
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,680
Come on, come on.
We're almost there.

632
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,925
Evening.
Evening.

633
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,127
Drop it. No, get off. Gimme!
That's a bad dog.

634
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,967
We made it.

635
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,761
Yeesh.

636
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,002
I wonder
what horrors lie inside.

637
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,003
There's probably
wild dogs in there.

638
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,560
Probably torture implements.

639
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,601
Rabid rats.

640
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,761
Brains in jars.

641
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,450
Jars of plucked-out eyeballs.

642
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,329
Bones of former students.

643
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,721
Why'd you scream?

644
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,644
I just assumed
there'd be something scary...

645
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,725
but it's actually
a really nice place.

646
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,685
We probably
shouldn't snoop around.

647
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,683
Yeah. Definitely not.

648
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,201
Come on.

649
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,961
Huh.

650
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,641
Hmm.

651
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,003
Not So Cheery O's?

652
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,163
This guy's bumming me out.

653
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,921
I gotta say, this has
not been the funnest snoop.

654
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,209
Yeah, no, totally.
Really sad snoop.

655
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,169
Kinda regretting it, actually.

656
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,731
I sure hope we don't ever
end up like him.

657
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,370
All alone.

658
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,640
It's impossible.
That would never happen.

659
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,722
Yeah, yeah.
That'll never happen.

660
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,530
<i>Unless he puts us
in separate classes.</i>

661
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,282
Which will never happen.

662
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,283
It'll never happen.
'Cause we control him now.

663
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,090
And if ever gives us
any trouble again,

664
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,884
all we gotta do
is snap our fingers...

665
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,451
and "Tra-la-laa!"

666
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,086
All of our problems go away.

667
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,044
Oh, yeah

668
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,565
<i>Beautiful</i>

669
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,722
<i>Even more beautiful</i>

670
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,720
Hey, Tommy. What's going on?

671
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,801
<i>Hey, guys-</i>

672
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,923
Whoa! Cool shirts!

673
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,770
What are you two doing together?

674
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,811
I separated you.

675
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
No, you didn't.

676
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,961
What are you talking about?

677
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,441
I signed the paperwork. See?

678
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,521
I don't see a signature.

679
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,736
Harold, do you see a signature?

680
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,250
Not a thing.

681
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,800
I actually can't see a thing.
These sunglasses are too dark.

682
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,321
What? I could have sworn
I signed that thing.

683
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,847
No matter. There!

684
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,604
Officially separated.

685
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,364
Forever.

686
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,284
What? Give me that.
Tra-la-laaa!

687
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,010
See? Problem solved.

688
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,044
Ooh!

689
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,444
Greetings, citizens!

690
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,601
Quick, in here.

691
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,087
Okay, you know what?

692
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,650
These shirts were way premature.

693
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,131
Definitely. Come on.

694
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,416
Let's turn him back into Krupp.

695
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,522
We can't. He'll separate us,
remember?

696
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,096
Yeah, well, we can't have him

697
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,565
wandering around
looking like that.

698
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,882
A triangle!

699
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,247
<i>It</i> dings!

700
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,766
Ah! Principal Krupp,
you caught us again.

701
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,650
You better take us
to your office

702
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,603
for a good old talking-to.

703
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,889
Right? Principal Krupp?

704
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,336
Principal who?

705
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,885
Captain Underpants,
get out here.

706
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,041
Sidekicks...

707
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,201
are you sure

708
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,049
my secret identity
requires these...

709
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,365
restricting,
uncomfortable clothes?

710
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,561
Yes, positive.

711
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,530
100% positive.
Now act like a principal.

712
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,727
Oh, right.

713
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,366
How does a principal act?

714
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Mean!

715
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,567
Okey-doke.

716
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,531
I'm a principal!

717
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,041
Oh, yeah. That's great.

718
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,205
Come on. We're almost there.

719
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,848
Oh, hello. Surprise.

720
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,045
It's Edith.

721
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,202
Did you like my tuna casserole?

722
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,689
I cannot lie.

723
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,406
I don't recall
having your tuna casserole.

724
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,369
What? Oh.

725
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,931
But if your casserole is

726
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,249
as striking
<i>as</i> your one blue eye...

727
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,371
Oh, I didn't think you noticed.

728
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,761
Oh, my.

729
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,928
Two blue eyes.

730
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,889
Ooh!

731
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,404
Principal Krupp.
It's time to go.

732
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,721
Gotta wrap it up.

733
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,041
Very well then.

734
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,401
Up, up, and...

735
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,562
And this way, sir.

736
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,724
Ooh! Flirt alert.

737
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,245
A-ha!

738
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,851
Wow, she's still on hold.

739
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,244
Phew! We made it.

740
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,129
Well, hello, citizen.
What?

741
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,320
Oh, and hello to you, too.

742
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,442
I was just, like,
admiring the view...

743
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,250
from your broken window.

744
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,129
It's in the shape of a man.

745
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,486
Anyway, lam here to interview

746
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,125
for the science teacher
position.

747
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,645
Perfect. I'm disguised

748
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,205
as an elementary
school principal.

749
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,925
Guys, I totally got this.

750
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,605
Don't worry one bit.

751
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,086
Now, where did I put
that resume?

752
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,440
No, not that. Oh, this thing.

753
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,441
This one's fun.

754
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,806
Ooh!
Heads up.

755
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,410
That one's gonna leave a mark.

756
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,925
I've been looking for that.

757
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,121
Oh, not that.

758
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,801
Ah-ha! Here we go.

759
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,089
Hmm. Says here
you're a science teacher?

760
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,446
Not exactly.

761
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,602
But you have
teaching experience?

762
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,131
Oh, no, I can't say that I do.

763
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,403
Not even, like, babysitting?

764
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,800
I would never sit on a baby.

765
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,961
Camp counselor?

766
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,406
Never was a camp counselor.

767
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,090
Although
I did receive counseling...

768
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,483
for some trauma I experienced
as a child.

769
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,480
I'm getting a really good vibe
about you.

770
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,608
Now hold on.
Let me see that resume.

771
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,967
It says here that you were
a genius inventor?

772
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,326
Mad...

773
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,002
genius inventor.
But yes.

774
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,123
And then for
the last few years...

775
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,964
you've "been in
a very dark place"...

776
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,366
and your title was...

777
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,443
"Revenge Seeker?"

778
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,965
"Revenge at all costs...

779
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,121
"Die! Die!"

780
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,281
Am I reading this right?

781
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,522
Yeah, that's basically
what I've been up to...

782
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,444
so here I am!

783
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,761
Applying for a job in

784
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,320
the thriving
public school system...

785
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,689
with all of
its amazing resources.

786
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,045
But honestly,
kids are so understanding.

787
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,804
So innocent.

788
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,964
Their smiles brighten my heart
and fill me with...

789
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,044
a joy-adjacent feeling.

790
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,521
As long
as they are controlled...

791
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,490
and do not laugh
nor smile nor play nor laugh.

792
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,210
Children must never laugh!

793
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,843
Well, you seem terrific!

794
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,161
You're hired!

795
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,890
What?
Excellent.

796
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,048
Oh, by the way,
going to need Fridays off...

797
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,089
and every other Tuesday
through Thursday...

798
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,526
for my evil experiments.

799
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,365
Hope that's not a problem.
Okay, bye-bye!

800
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,081
Oh, this is bad.

801
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,527
We just hired a maniac
for a science teacher!

802
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,047
Uh, yeah. We gotta fix this
before Krupp finds out.

803
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,329
Sounds like a job
for Captain Underpants.

804
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,721
No, no, no.
You need to stay here.

805
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,405
Okay, you're
the principal, remember?

806
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,887
Yeah, just sit there
and look angry for no reason.

807
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,202
You got it. Grr...

808
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,721
Ooh!

809
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,368
That will be interesting
to put my eye up to.

810
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,922
What?
How did I get here?

811
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,360
Why is my face wet?

812
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,726
Hiya, class.

813
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,245
I'm your cool, new teacher.

814
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,643
Not some scary guy
with a secret evil agenda.

815
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,200
Anyway, I'm just going to dive
right in here.

816
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,600
If there was one thing

817
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,320
about this world
that you could change...

818
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,761
what would it be?

819
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,763
Ooh! Ooh! Peace on Earth.

820
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,922
Unattainable. Anyone else?

821
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,444
Pacific Ocean into chocolate.

822
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,090
Atlantic into nacho cheese.

823
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,645
Ifs like we're the same person

824
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,921
and yet so, so different.

825
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,770
I love it.

826
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,570
But more importantly...

827
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,122
if I had to change one thing
about the world...

828
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,966
it would be to get rid of...

829
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,121
laughter.

830
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,851
Get rid of laughter?

831
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,570
What kind of person
wants to do that?

832
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,681
Oh, Oh! Ah! Ah! Sir, sir.

833
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,801
<i>Yes'?</i>

834
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,881
I love it.

835
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,803
Oh, look at this.
We got a grade A suck-up.

836
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,849
Good to know, good to know.

837
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,001
<i>Anyway.</i>

838
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,007
This is the brain
of an average child.

839
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,207
Right here is

840
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,288
the "thinking about candy"
lopalus.

841
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,488
The "fear of
what's under the bed" lobe.

842
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,166
This is the "only thing
I'll eat is pizza...

843
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,005
"chicken nuggets,
or buttered noodles" lobe.

844
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,770
Right here is the

845
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,683
"as soon as
someone else has a toy...

846
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,286
"I want that toy" anterior lobe.

847
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,171
And this...

848
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,169
This is the
Hahaguffawchuckleamalus.

849
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,722
This funny little purple part

850
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,162
holds our entire capacity
for laughter.

851
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,721
For years,
I've tried to shrink it

852
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,808
or cut it out entirely...

853
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,444
but frustratingly,

854
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,524
our survival seems
dependent upon it.

855
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,807
I don't like this. I mean,
I don't really understand it.

856
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,240
But the stuff I am understanding

857
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,526
seems genuinely bad to me.

858
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,886
Yeah, same.

859
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,964
Um... Excuse me, Professor P?

860
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,003
Why are you trying to
get rid of laughter?

861
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,531
Isn't laughter
the best medicine?

862
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,162
Medicine is the best medicine!
So...

863
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,486
Yeesh.

864
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,881
What?

865
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,087
What does the P stand for?

866
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,561
Excuse me?

867
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,881
The P. In your name.
What does it stand for?

868
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,530
Oh, it's private.

869
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,088
So that means your name is
Professor Privates?

870
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,725
What's so funny?

871
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,086
I don't get it.

872
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,607
Principal's office, now!

873
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,721
You too!

874
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,006
Why him?

875
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,606
Because your friendship
and shared sense of humor

876
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,881
irritates me...

877
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,247
and must be destroyed!

878
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,960
We gotta do something about
that new science teacher.

879
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,407
Yeah, it's like he's even more
of a villain than Krupp.

880
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,289
I didn't even think
that was possible.

881
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,936
Whoa! Whoa! Wait a second.
Tell me about it.

882
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,610
What? Who do you think...

883
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,600
Oh, okay. Maybe we could
fix this if we just...

884
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,290
Can you hear me?
No, that'll never work.

885
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,209
I'm sitting right here.

886
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,806
Wait, Professor P doesn't want
anybody to know his last name.

887
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,041
Right?
Right!

888
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,884
Who's Professor P?
Exactly!

889
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,761
Where is the respect?
I am your principal!

890
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,801
Wait, is he Krupp again?

891
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,803
George!
Yup. Pretty sure he is.

892
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,921
Harold!

893
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,001
How'd that even happen?

894
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,884
Tra-la-laaa!

895
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,089
Greetings!
I need to get the...

896
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,560
Sidekicks, what do I need again?

897
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,887
The file
on the new science teacher.

898
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,961
Oh, right, right.

899
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,441
I need the bile
on the gooey fence creature.

900
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,806
Science teacher.

901
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,961
The dewy tense preacher?

902
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,289
The dial on the...

903
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,771
Oh, come on!

904
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,928
Thank you, human woman!

905
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,925
Sidekicks, explain to me

906
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,809
the importance
of this secret file.

907
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,320
There's a new
super villain in town

908
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,040
and we're trying to
discover his weakness.

909
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,121
Oh...

910
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,283
"Poopypants."

911
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,648
<i>Hallelujah</i>

912
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,609
<i>Hallelujah</i>

913
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,967
<i>His name is Poopypants
We found his weakness</i>

914
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,122
<i>Hallelujah</i>

915
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,008
<i>He wants to rid the world</i>

916
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,521
<i>Of laughter</i>

917
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,681
<i>Forever</i>

918
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,841
<i>And ever</i>

919
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,047
<i>We will defeat him</i>

920
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,488
<i>Hallelujah Hallelujah</i>

921
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,166
<i>Poopypants</i>

922
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,845
Captain?
You forgetting something?

923
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,367
Oh, look at that.
They came off again.

924
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,566
Hey there, kiddo.

925
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,290
First day for Professor P.

926
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,403
Can you tell me where
the lunch is consumed?

927
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,565
What's going on with your face?

928
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,721
Are you choking?

929
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,041
Do you need to sneeze?

930
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,845
I see, I see.

931
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,004
Got a case of
the giggles' huh? That's fun.

932
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,806
Well, I've got
just the remedy for that.

933
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,089
In the cage. Now!
Why?

934
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,844
Because I hate
laughter and children...

935
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,088
and I've got a cage
in a briefcase!

936
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,886
Okay, well, have a nice day.

937
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,883
Now what's for lunch?

938
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,727
Excuse me, could you explain
to me why this is funny?

939
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,723
You! Why is everyone laughing?

940
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,567
Uh, you're asking
the wrong dude.

941
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,765
<i>"Captain Underpants
and the Perilous Plot of...</i>

942
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,763
<i>"Professor Poem/pants."</i>

943
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,176
Oh, What's happening?

944
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,929
I'm hyperventilating.

945
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,281
Esteemed members

946
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,448
of the Nobel Prize Committee...

947
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,682
it is with great pride...

948
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,524
that I present to you...

949
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,401
the Sizerator 2000!

950
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,601
- Oh.
- Ooh.

951
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,724
Behold, we can smallify.

952
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,366
No more traffic jams.

953
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,761
And conversely, largify.

954
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,048
Look at how big this hot dog is.

955
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,321
Going to need a lot of mustard
for this frankfurter!

956
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,641
The Nobel Peace Prize
in Inventing Stuff goes to...

957
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,087
um,

958
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,161
Professor...

959
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,130
ls that really your name?

960
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,408
It's not, like,
some kind of joke?

961
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,449
No. It's not, like, a joke.

962
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,444
Ifs a traditional name
in New Swissland.

963
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,088
Am I pronouncing it right?

964
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,163
Poopypants?

965
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,329
More or less. Except
the emphasis is on the "poop."

966
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,411
Why are you laughing?

967
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,490
I've invented a shrinking
and enlarging ray!

968
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,926
I should be famous!

969
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,482
I should be dating models
twice my size...

970
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,608
and doing the talk show circuit!

971
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,161
I should be protecting
baby seals as a cause...

972
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,931
that I say I care about,
but not really!

973
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,162
This guy is too much!

974
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,005
Stop! Stop laughing!

975
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,207
No, stop it!
Okay.

976
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,364
Phew! Oh...

977
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,642
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

978
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,330
Here. Take the award.

979
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,450
It's really fun
to say Poopypants.

980
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,690
You keep your stupid award!
I don't want it anymore.

981
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,007
Oh, and one more thing...

982
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,442
On behalf
of the Nobel Prize committee,

983
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,124
please accept our apology.

984
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,011
And could you change me
back now please?

985
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,336
Why don't you go on and invent

986
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,044
your own shrinking
and enlarging ray...

987
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,481
if you think you're so smart?

988
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,687
How much of that was out loud?

989
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,366
Extra! Extra!
Get our latest issue!

990
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,364
<i>Captain Underpants
and the Perilous Plot</i>

991
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,482
<i>of Professor Poopypants.</i>

992
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,210
Oh, no.

993
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,246
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

994
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,406
Hmm. How many A's
are there in "Tra-la-laaa?"

995
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,568
What?
<i>I'll</i> just go with 11.

996
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,688
Enjoying your
first day, professor?

997
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,729
The complete opposite, actually.

998
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,201
Look at what these
little monsters have created!

999
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,891
We must lock them up,
probably, like, forever!

1000
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,081
Hmm.

1001
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,365
Oh, my.

1002
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,851
This is not a comic.

1003
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,528
This is a history book.

1004
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,726
What?

1005
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,047
And as such, it should be
taught in every classroom.

1006
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,565
And you yourself
must teach it...

1007
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,769
because that is how good it is.

1008
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,360
I don't understand.
I thought, like,

1009
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,084
we'd be on the same page here.

1010
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,087
What page is that?
I'm on page 9, here.

1011
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,241
It's fantastic.

1012
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,401
Look, look.

1013
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,936
<i>It's about
this evil science teacher...</i>

1014
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,962
<i>who looks a lot like you,
by the way.</i>

1015
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,248
<i>And he wanted to
rid the world of laughter...</i>

1016
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,960
<i>but he couldn't figure out
how to do It.</i>

1017
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,847
<i>Even worse, I! seemed like
everywhere he went,</i>

1018
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,888
<i>people were having fun
and laughing.</i>

1019
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,602
<i>It just was infuriating.</i>

1020
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,123
<i>But then, he discovered
someone who wasn't.</i>

1021
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,051
Why is it funny?

1022
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,807
Anti-Humor Boy!

1023
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,568
And then the professor says,
"Very interesting."

1024
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,411
That's my voice for him.

1025
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,483
Wait, wait, wait. Gimme that.

1026
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,768
That's no Anti-Humor Boy.

1027
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,601
That's the suck up from class.

1028
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,442
Very interesting.

1029
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,808
You boys
don't even realize it...

1030
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,691
but your silly comic book
just helped me figure out...

1031
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,969
how to wipe out laughter
on the... Oof!

1032
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,525
Out of the road, bozo!

1033
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,886
Hey, watch where you're going!

1034
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,644
You just hit
Professor Poopypants.

1035
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,450
Poopypants?

1036
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,124
That's not funny!
That's not funny!

1037
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,084
Ever heard of the sidewalk?

1038
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,443
Oh, if I had insurance,
you'd be in... Ow!

1039
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,327
I'll admit that was surprising.

1040
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,521
Wow.

1041
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,648
That actually
worked out for once.

1042
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,325
Good job, Captain Underpants.

1043
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,164
At your service, sidekicks.

1044
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,924
Now where was I?

1045
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,321
We should probably
get back to class, huh?

1046
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,323
Yeah, we probably should.

1047
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,776
Excuse me. Pardon me.
If you could just...

1048
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,840
Watch your feet.
Excuse me.

1049
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,291
Sorry. Thank you.
Oh, hey, Todd.

1050
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,290
Now, let me ask you something.

1051
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,681
If you could
control your principal...

1052
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,841
what would you do?

1053
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,731
Shh.
It's starting. It's starting.

1054
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,216
I just wanna make sure you apply

1055
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,890
the extra credit
to next semester.

1056
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,242
I won't be needing it
this semester, of course.

1057
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,401
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah.

1058
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,776
Whatever floats
your boat, Melvin.

1059
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,006
Excuse me?

1060
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,844
Can I please get
an ice cream sandwich?

1061
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,487
Yeah, scram, okay?
We're closed for Ebola.

1062
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,489
Okay, just a quick check

1063
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,164
to make sure
that we're connected.

1064
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,163
Mmm-hmm. Okay.
We're sure that's safe?

1065
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,924
<i>And now,
some classic funny bloopers!</i>

1066
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,367
Ah. That's a good one.
Oh, this one's my favorite.

1067
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,048
I'm sorry.
Why are you showing me this?

1068
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,366
Ow.

1069
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,771
Come on, that was funny!

1070
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,002
That child walked
right into that rake.

1071
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,091
I'm bored! What else is on?

1072
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,881
Fascinating.
Computer, scan.

1073
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,731
I don't believe it.

1074
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,920
You know, I suspected

1075
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,406
something smaller than normal,
but this...

1076
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,723
This.
What? What is it?

1077
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,129
I can't find it.
Your Hahaguffawchuckleamalus!

1078
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,601
You don't have one!

1079
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,244
I don't get it.
Exactly.

1080
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,803
You have no sense of humor
like a chair or a supermodel.

1081
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,601
Melvin, with your brain
and my brain together...

1082
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,127
we can finally wipe out laughter

1083
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,407
for once and for all!

1084
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,122
So George and Harold
want a supervillain...

1085
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,644
well, ask and ye shall receive!

1086
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,084
I hereby declare...

1087
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,322
the Jerome Horwitz
art program...

1088
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,490
reinstated!

1089
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,681
Oh...

1090
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,000
After you, sir.

1091
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,524
Ooh, what if we...
I'm already on it.

1092
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,170
Oh, this is gonna be epic!

1093
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,923
Come on, Captain, draw!

1094
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,207
Move your hand
in the shape of a person!

1095
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,169
Why does it look like a chicken?

1096
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,448
This whole visual
storytelling thing is hard!

1097
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,521
Oh, that's good.

1098
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,045
Here, these need words.

1099
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,521
Hey, sidekicks...

1100
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,525
why are we doing this again?

1101
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,887
Well, we're making
school fun again.

1102
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,202
You know, "free the children."

1103
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,176
Hey, hey! What if we put
this panel right here?

1104
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,201
Oh, yes! Yes, yes.

1105
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,049
Ah, yes. Of course.

1106
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,361
Fun.

1107
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,567
On it!

1108
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,641
Ha-ha!

1109
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,481
Uh...

1110
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,045
Where'd everybody go?

1111
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,042
Where did this even come from?

1112
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,161
Hey!

1113
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,800
Oh, hey, sidekicks.
Glad you could join.

1114
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,086
How did you even do this?

1115
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,696
I thought you said
you were looking after the...

1116
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,176
Oh, my goodness!
Is that a Ferris wheel?

1117
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,565
Well, of course it is!

1118
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,722
It came
with the carnival I ordered.

1119
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,851
This cotton candy
makes me feel powerful!

1120
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,365
Hey, uh,
where are all the teachers?

1121
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,567
Detention.

1122
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,047
They have a real
attitude problem.

1123
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,243
Sure beats having Krupp around!

1124
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,722
Oh, yeah. Krupp would totally
lose his mind if he saw this.

1125
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,405
Step right up!

1126
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,006
Who'll be the first
to dunk the principal?

1127
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,080
No!

1128
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,850
I'm drowning!

1129
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,441
Tra-la...

1130
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,056
All right, that's enough.
Recess is over.

1131
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,127
Ah, come on!

1132
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,241
Just one more ride!
Whoa!

1133
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,929
Hey, watch it!
What is this, a carnival?

1134
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,684
I hate carnivals!

1135
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,968
Oh, this looks fun!
How do we play?

1136
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,451
Hold your fire!

1137
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,961
What is happening?

1138
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,121
Who wants ice cream?

1139
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,611
Ice cream!

1140
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,840
What are we gonna do?
We can't keep this up forever.

1141
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,882
We have to! We'll just
take shifts watching him.

1142
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,371
I'll take today.
You take tonight.

1143
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,760
Sugar!

1144
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,961
Sugar!

1145
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,962
Harold, I really
want some sugar.

1146
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,406
Me too.

1147
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,485
We made the wrong choice!

1148
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,483
This did not solve anything!

1149
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,000
Hey, sidekicks!

1150
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,970
Check this out!

1151
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,769
Geronimo!

1152
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,921
No!

1153
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,165
This way!

1154
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,163
Field trip, anyone?

1155
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,246
No, no, no!

1156
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,327
Nothing's more fun than fire!

1157
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,005
Except being on...

1158
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,685
Fire!

1159
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,321
What is happening?

1160
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,523
Tra-la-laaaa!

1161
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,367
Now, this is
how you run a school!

1162
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,849
Free the children!

1163
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,641
Wait a minute.

1164
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,841
What the...

1165
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,841
How did this...

1166
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,170
I don't understand.

1167
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,210
Help!
What the...

1168
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,726
You...

1169
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,204
You two.

1170
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,204
Your friendship...

1171
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,851
is no more.

1172
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,081
What?

1173
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,401
George!

1174
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,767
Harold!

1175
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,441
Harold! Come back!

1176
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,763
George, I'm right here!
I'm right here!

1177
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,242
Oh, no! No, no!
Don't leave me!

1178
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,562
I won't! I won't, George!

1179
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,720
Harold!

1180
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,285
No, no! Wait, wait! Stop!

1181
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,090
George!

1182
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,083
George!

1183
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,085
This thing is amazing,
Professor P.

1184
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,327
You could probably solve

1185
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,040
world hunger
with an invention like this.

1186
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,891
Pass!
More importantly...

1187
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,764
how do I look?

1188
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,651
Just like you do in this comic!

1189
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,802
Good! Now,
hands off the merchandise,

1190
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,843
and go fetch
your little toilet, okay?

1191
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,924
I call it "The Turbo..."

1192
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,447
Yeah, yeah. Couple of
gold stars for you, kiddo.

1193
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,005
Let the Poopageddon begin!

1194
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,849
Whoo-ee!

1195
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,170
What?
Oh, you've gotta be joking me!

1196
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,605
Poopypants has no gas!
You can't write this stuff.

1197
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,125
Where would a burgeoning villain

1198
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,804
find unlimited power?

1199
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,691
True power comes from within.

1200
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,171
No, it doesn't, Melvin!

1201
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,320
That's on stupid posters!

1202
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,361
Okay.

1203
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,528
It comes
from enormous energy sources!

1204
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,880
A nuclear waste dump.

1205
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,041
I see where you're going.

1206
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,690
A poisonous chemical factory.

1207
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,487
Or perhaps
a place even more toxic!

1208
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,165
Whoo!
These leftovers got a kick.

1209
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,007
Oh, it's a powerful smell.

1210
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,531
Back in business, baby!

1211
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,725
Memorize these elements...

1212
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,008
Oxygen. Beryllium.

1213
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,043
Boringillium.

1214
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,725
Lameium.

1215
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,166
Snoronium.

1216
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,528
Excuse me, everybody,
there's a giant...

1217
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,216
Do not interrupt
while I'm reading

1218
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,890
monotone from my textbook!

1219
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,088
But the toilet!

1220
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,241
Ugh.

1221
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,209
Just go.

1222
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,601
Harold?

1223
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,441
George?

1224
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,443
Students and faculty

1225
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,564
<i>of Jerome Horwitz Elementary...</i>

1226
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,126
<i>the world, as you know it,
is about to go extinct.</i>

1227
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,046
And a new world order
is about to rise!

1228
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,725
One that is, you know, honestly

1229
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,484
pretty similar
to the old world order...

1230
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,962
except for one tiny detail...

1231
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,481
Melvin?

1232
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,290
Comin' atcha!

1233
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,807
Powered by
Melvin's unique neurology...

1234
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,124
I will successfully disable
the Hahaguffawchuckleamalus...

1235
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,285
of every single child at
Jerome Horwitz Elementary.

1236
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,161
<i>For I, Professor Poopypants...</i>

1237
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,604
Yeah, it's a funny name.

1238
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,643
It just makes you
laugh and laugh, right?

1239
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,321
Get down!

1240
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,842
Still give you the chuckles now?

1241
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,405
Poopypants!

1242
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,011
I don't get it.

1243
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,241
Why is that funny?

1244
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,441
Perfect!

1245
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,524
Finally!
You're speaking my language!

1246
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,125
Oh, no. This is bad.

1247
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,446
This is seriously bad.

1248
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,602
I mean,
a world without laughter?

1249
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,400
George, if he destroys
our sense of humor,

1250
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,521
he destroys us!

1251
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,365
Imagine how boring
our comics will be.

1252
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,969
<i>Captain Underpants
and the Purchase</i>

1253
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,610
<i>of the Sensible Beige Pants.</i>

1254
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,004
<i>Captain Underpants
Eats All of His Falafel.</i>

1255
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,686
<i>Captain Underpants
Watches Cement Dry.</i>

1256
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,696
And would the creators of

1257
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,849
this absolutely
hilarious comic book...

1258
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,209
please come out, come out,
wherever you are!

1259
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,044
You're next.

1260
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,204
Okay, we have to stop him.

1261
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,210
We've gotta find a way
to unplug Melvin.

1262
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,401
Yeah.

1263
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,246
But how do we get to him
without Poopypants seeing us?

1264
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,482
What are you two doing together?

1265
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,324
Are you in there?

1266
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,000
Oh...
Maybe you're hiding here.

1267
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,648
Oh, sorry.
Are you stuck on hold?

1268
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,761
Mmm-hmm.

1269
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,242
Oh, totally hate
when that happens.

1270
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,561
Well, good luck with that.

1271
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,489
Now, where are
those two little...

1272
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,762
Stand down, Poopypants!

1273
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,081
What is happening?

1274
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,765
I hope this works.

1275
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,445
Tra-la-laaa!

1276
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,686
Ow! Ow!

1277
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,856
Keep standing down.
I'm just gonna be a second.

1278
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,245
Ow.

1279
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,842
I bet he thought
that was going to be cooler.

1280
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,764
Oh, boy. Here goes nothing.

1281
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,041
Ha-ha!

1282
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,765
Prepare to be vanquished...

1283
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,285
and justice to be served

1284
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,051
on a piping hot
platter of freedom!

1285
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,770
With a side order of liberty...

1286
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,641
and a super-sized cup
filled with freedom also!

1287
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,286
Impressive use
of fast-food analogies,

1288
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,607
you giant baby with a cape on!

1289
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,131
Let's do this.

1290
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,282
Freeze! The following sequence
contains scenes...

1291
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,776
that are so intense,
horrific, and violent...

1292
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,801
And expensive.

1293
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,136
That we can only show it
using a technology known as...

1294
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,288
<i>Flip-O-Rama!</i>

1295
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,566
<i>Take it away, Harold.</i>

1296
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,216
Okay, first Professor Poopypants

1297
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,416
gave Captain Underpants
the boot.

1298
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,726
Foot! Foot! Ow!

1299
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,536
Then he made
an Underpants sandwich.

1300
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,896
Punch, punch! Punch, punch!

1301
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,136
And then, they played
a friendly game of paddleball!

1302
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,924
Oh, no!

1303
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,081
Darn.

1304
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,083
Okay, what's next?
Oh, yes!

1305
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,084
Then, Poopypants summoned
an army of dolphins...

1306
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,296
Wait, what?
Why are you always

1307
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,576
sneaking dolphins
into the movie?

1308
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,896
What do you have
against dolphins anyway?

1309
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,216
I don't have nothing
against dolphins,

1310
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,976
- it just didn't happen!
- Well, so what'?

1311
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,651
We get to say what happened.
It's the Flip-O-Rama.

1312
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,802
I like dolphins.
The dolphins are in.

1313
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,896
Fine, all right.
Let's just keep going.

1314
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,056
- You sure?
- Yep, positive.

1315
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,080
Thank you.

1316
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,496
- Anyway, Poopypants didn't realize it...
- Quiet five, quiet five.

1317
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,807
But George and Harold's plan
was working out perfectly.

1318
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,896
So, they
shot themselves to the top

1319
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,365
of the Turbo Toilet 2000!

1320
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,841
To keep things dramatic,
they didn't quite make it.

1321
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,769
And then...
And then...

1322
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And then...

1323
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,610
What happened
to the Flip-O-Rama?

1324
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,886
I ran outta paper.

1325
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,728
Hey, Melvin!
Take that thing off your head.

1326
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,881
We gotta stop Poopypants!

1327
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,725
Professor Poopypants!

1328
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,041
George and Harold
are trying to stop you!

1329
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,124
You are just so annoying!

1330
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,284
So, you two
little numbskulls thought

1331
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,481
you could distract me...

1332
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,723
with this idiotic, naked man.
Am I right?

1333
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,848
I'm not naked!

1334
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,210
Any final words before this
whole revenge thing goes down?

1335
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,525
Yeah, wait, wait. Listen.

1336
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,081
We apologize
for making fun of your name.

1337
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,561
I mean, that was just wrong.

1338
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,566
Yeah, we're sorry.
The truth is. Professor P...

1339
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,085
you have probably, like,

1340
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,003
the greatest name
we've ever heard.

1341
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,528
I mean, George, imagine
if we had names like that.

1342
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,324
Oh, that would be so cool!

1343
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,084
Okay, wait, let's do it.
Let's try it.

1344
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,921
Oh, I would be
Fluffy Toiletnose.

1345
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,880
Yeah! I would be
Sir Cheeseball Wafflefanny.

1346
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,216
Yeah, sure. You're a knight.

1347
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,241
This is so good!

1348
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,761
I wanna change mine.

1349
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,287
I'd be
Buttcheeks von Stinkelsberg.

1350
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,680
Stinkelsberg.

1351
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,681
Yeah, those are all
really silly names,

1352
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,080
but there's
nothing funny about...

1353
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,851
Professor
Pee-Pee Diarrheastein

1354
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,366
Poopypants Esquire!

1355
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,766
Sir, are you saying
your full name is...

1356
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,806
Pee-Pee Diarrheastein
Poopypants Esquire?

1357
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,881
Uh-huh.

1358
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,405
Stop it! Stop laughing!

1359
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,369
Come on! Listen, your problem

1360
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,090
isn't that people laugh at you.

1361
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,607
Your problem is that
you can't laugh at yourself.

1362
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,286
Oh, really, Oprah?
Is that my problem?

1363
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,608
Well, your problem is this...

1364
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,641
No!

1365
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,326
Oh, I hope
you enjoyed your years

1366
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,482
of laughter and merriment...

1367
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,281
because they're about
to come to an end.

1368
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,004
Do you find anything funny
about me now?

1369
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,246
You mean, other than your name?

1370
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,962
Yes! Other than that!

1371
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,128
And your hair'?

1372
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,201
What?

1373
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,850
My hair's cool, I thought.

1374
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,684
Are you kidding me?

1375
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,650
That's almost as funny as
my hair back in kindygarten!

1376
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,370
Remember that afro?

1377
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,602
No!
No, this can't be happening!

1378
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,682
Computer, activate brain scan.

1379
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:41,125
Let's see. The frontal lobes
look big and healthy.

1380
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,044
The Hahaguffawchuckleamalus

1381
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,851
looks all shrimpy,
so, what gives?

1382
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,521
It can't be!

1383
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,808
Their Hahaguffawchuckleamaluses,

1384
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,370
they're enormous!

1385
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,006
I need more power.

1386
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,961
Anything strike you
as funny now?

1387
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,567
I'm sure
we can think of something!

1388
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,042
George, I can't smile anymore.

1389
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,850
No! Harold!

1390
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,963
<i>One down, undone to go.</i>

1391
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,166
Harold.

1392
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,041
Harold. Harold,
can you hear me?

1393
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,084
Harold!

1394
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,570
George! George, is that you?

1395
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,721
Right here, buddy.

1396
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,169
What's happening?
We're shrinking!

1397
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,736
Now, if we don't laugh
at something soon,

1398
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,921
we may never laugh again.

1399
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,208
Oh, no! What do we do?
What do we do? What do we do?

1400
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,408
Well, we have to think
of something funny, okay?

1401
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,523
Okay, yeah, sure.
Something funny.

1402
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:46,921
Anything?

1403
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,331
No, I got nothing.
Me neither.

1404
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,640
More shrinkage!

1405
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,606
Okay, okay.
What did we use to find funny?

1406
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,888
Mostly potty humor. Poop,
vomit, that kind of thing.

1407
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,886
Really? Ugh. That is, like,
the lowest form of comedy.

1408
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,850
Don't you say that, Harold!
Don't you leave me!

1409
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,176
Attention everyone!

1410
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,124
<i>Poopypants here with a little
update on the Poopageddon.</i>

1411
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,602
<i>Due to the success
of my plan thus far...</i>

1412
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,603
<i>We decided to wipe out laughter</i>

1413
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,444
<i>on the entire planet.</i>

1414
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,364
<i>After that, you know,
I'll probably</i>

1415
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,520
<i>move on to other planets...</i>

1416
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,601
<i>Jupiter, Mars...</i>

1417
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,529
can't forget Uranus!

1418
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,124
Wait. Did he just say...

1419
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,122
Your anus.

1420
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,281
I know!

1421
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,561
Uranus!

1422
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,450
Yeah, and once I'm through
with the gas giants...

1423
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,568
I figure I'll go
after the other galaxies...

1424
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,767
What?

1425
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,570
It feels so good to laugh!

1426
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,844
No, stop it! Stop laughing!
You're ruining everything!

1427
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,571
Yikes!
Extra credit or survival?

1428
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,171
Extra credit or survival?

1429
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,163
I choose survival!

1430
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,841
Uh-oh!

1431
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,841
Oh, yeah!

1432
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,881
Wow!

1433
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,163
No, how could this be happening?

1434
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,367
Never underestimate

1435
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,522
the power of laughter,
Poopypants!

1436
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,802
Oh, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1437
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,881
Oh!

1438
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,165
Ah! Whoa!

1439
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,562
Harold! Harold, we did it!

1440
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,401
Harold?

1441
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,966
I think I bruised a rib.

1442
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,003
Because I've never laughed
so hard in my life!

1443
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:19,010
Oh, we'll see who's laughing
once I shrink you down...

1444
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,208
where you will live
in my pocket forever...

1445
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,601
amongst my
cherry-flavored lip balm...

1446
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,723
my butterscotch-flavored
lip balm...

1447
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,801
Oh, neato!

1448
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,723
My mint-flavored
lip balm...

1449
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,043
my extra-moisturized
SPF lip balm...

1450
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,931
and all of my lip balms!

1451
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,564
Why does one person have
so much lip balm?

1452
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,721
Help!
Help!

1453
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,683
Please, anyone! Help!

1454
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,451
Help!

1455
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,643
Ooh, I hope you can find
tiny enough pens...

1456
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,882
to make your small,
little comic books with...

1457
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,042
'cause you're about to
get smallified!

1458
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,888
Tra-la-laa!

1459
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,644
I feel...

1460
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,681
awesome!

1461
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,887
No way!

1462
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,450
He has real superpowers!

1463
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,484
Oh, that is an obvious twist
that I did not see coming...

1464
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,608
despite my many years
of comic book studies!

1465
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,445
I have come to save the day!

1466
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,761
Yay!

1467
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,331
Yeah, and I've come to ruin it!

1468
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,760
So back off, buddy!

1469
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,521
Ha-ha!

1470
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,011
Ew, that's gross!

1471
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,730
Oh, there's more
where that came from.

1472
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,491
Monday! Tuesday!
Wednesday! Thursday!

1473
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,365
Ha-ha! Unlimited underpants!

1474
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,410
I am so glad that we gave him
that superpower!

1475
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,040
My Sizerator!

1476
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,931
Well, it's mine now!

1477
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,163
Alas!

1478
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:57,484
The final failure
for Professor Poopypants.

1479
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,165
Hmm. What does this button do?

1480
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,248
Oh...

1481
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,408
Well, hello down there!

1482
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,561
No!

1483
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,840
Must be holding it backwards.

1484
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,091
Yup. That was it.

1485
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,089
Wow. He is super dumb.

1486
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,846
I can't reach.

1487
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,407
Time to take you down
once and for all, Poopypants!

1488
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,210
Buzz off!

1489
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,246
Captain Underpants!

1490
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,080
Fly over here
so we can make you big again!

1491
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,321
Crackerjack idea.

1492
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,201
George, just don't...

1493
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,402
No!

1494
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,600
Ha-ha!

1495
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,928
Give him a big hand
for that one, everybody!

1496
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,606
Get him.

1497
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,767
Whoops.

1498
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,049
Look what I've got.

1499
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,006
A tiny school

1500
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,640
filled with tiny children...

1501
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,567
and their tiny teachers
whose tiny salaries...

1502
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,768
reflect their size and also...

1503
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,730
the value society puts
on education.

1504
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,600
I'll take that!

1505
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,603
Oh! Then I'll take that!

1506
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,131
Ow! Did you just slap me?

1507
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,044
Yes, I did.
And you deserved it.

1508
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,851
No, I didn't! Your hand
is huge! That hurt a lot!

1509
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,161
Give it back, it's mine!

1510
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,401
No! Hands off!

1511
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,244
No fair! No backsies!
Give it to me!

1512
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,686
Would you just give me that?

1513
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,370
Now look what you've done!

1514
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,521
Give it!

1515
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,450
George!

1516
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,081
Gotcha!

1517
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,404
Yeah, that's more like it!

1518
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,166
Nice work, sidekicks!

1519
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,969
I'll just put this back down
right here.

1520
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,400
No, no, no!
Captain Underpants...

1521
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,403
There we go. Back to normal...

1522
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,971
like it never happened.

1523
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,289
Oh, no, where'd he go?

1524
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,010
You'll never catch me!

1525
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,322
You can't stop
Professor Poopypants!

1526
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,365
Get back here!
I can't reach!

1527
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,920
Get him, Captain Underpants!

1528
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,962
A bee!
Get away from me!

1529
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,248
I'm free!

1530
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,640
What? What the...
Why would you do that?

1531
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,524
You just let
the bad guy get away!

1532
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,889
Come on, guys. Pretty sure
the bee wasn't the bad guy.

1533
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,291
What the heck happened here?

1534
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,560
You're welcome, peace keeper!

1535
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,170
Would you keep it down?

1536
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,921
Did not see that coming!
Take that, Doctor Diaper!

1537
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,125
I can't believe we made him.

1538
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,362
And he's even dumber
in real life.

1539
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,441
Oh! Look! Little dolphins!

1540
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,449
We have to get rid of him,
don't we?

1541
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,011
I think we do.

1542
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,491
I mean,
he's a way bigger problem

1543
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,891
than Mr. Krupp ever was.

1544
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,043
But, you know, George...

1545
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,521
bringing back Krupp
permanently...

1546
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,800
we'll never be
in the same class again.

1547
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,161
Yeah, I know.

1548
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,560
But just 'cause we're
in separate classes,

1549
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,244
doesn't mean
we can't be friends...

1550
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,766
Well, yeah. I mean, we'll
always be friends. Right?

1551
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,366
Yeah. Hey, in fact,
you know what?

1552
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,607
Let's do a blood oath.

1553
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,016
But minus the blood. I don't
wanna see the blood. No blood.

1554
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,087
Pinky swear?

1555
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,241
No, that's lame. Mmm-mmm.

1556
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,329
Oh, got it!

1557
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,085
Oh, no. What? No!

1558
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,526
That's not sanitary.

1559
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,489
Can't we just do
a verbal declaration

1560
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,766
of friendship or something?

1561
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,405
Oh. Okay. Yeah, wow.

1562
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,131
I haven't really
prepared anything, but...

1563
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,130
I, Harold...

1564
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,770
hereby declare George

1565
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,481
as my best friend,
permanently, forever.

1566
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,644
And I, George, accept
the permanent rights...

1567
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,080
that Harold has given me

1568
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,083
to be his best friend forever...

1569
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,720
and the constitution
of friends...

1570
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:57,881
America, friendship.

1571
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,256
And the United States
of America.

1572
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,776
Land and the United States.
Good, okay, yeah.

1573
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,080
It's done. All right, cool.
Phew.

1574
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,969
What a relief.
Yeah, no kidding.

1575
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,480
I mean,
why were we even worried...

1576
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,682
about that whole classroom
thing in the first place?

1577
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,841
You know, I don't know.

1578
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,286
We were younger then.

1579
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,641
Clearly, we have grown.

1580
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,801
Clearly, we have.

1581
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,161
Chums!

1582
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,406
Thank you for chronicling

1583
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,767
my surprisingly
grounded biography.

1584
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,526
The truth is a slippery thing.

1585
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,920
And you nailed it.

1586
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,361
Now it is time to fly again!

1587
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,409
Farewell, my dear sidekicks.

1588
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,129
Goodbye, Captain Underpants.

1589
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,361
Goodbye.

1590
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,691
George! Harold!

1591
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,416
What am I doing in your
tree house again?

1592
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,964
You boys are in big trouble!

1593
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,765
I don't know how big yet...

1594
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,360
Why does this keep happening?

1595
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,243
Where are my clothes?
Where are they?

1596
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,961
I don't get it.

1597
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,241
Why is Krupp so angry

1598
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,243
and Captain Underpants so happy?

1599
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,371
Maybe it's because
Captain Underpants had us.

1600
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,046
You know, he had friends.

1601
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,563
We could fix that.

1602
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,445
Yeah, you know, we could.

1603
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,925
So that's how we came

1604
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,490
to pull the rarest prank
of all...

1605
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,245
The prank...

1606
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,051
for good.

1607
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,241
Huh?

1608
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,448
"Do you want to go a date?"

1609
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,247
A date?

1610
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,406
"Love, Edith."

1611
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,766
"Principal Krupp."

1612
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:44,961
Oh!

1613
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:49,126
Benjamin Krupp, you sly dog.

1614
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,010
Edith, the lunch lady.

1615
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,491
Big plans tonight, Mr. Krupp?

1616
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,564
No! What?
That's none of your business!

1617
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,969
But, if you must know...

1618
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,851
yeah, I actually do.

1619
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,050
By the way,
I was tidying up my office...

1620
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,441
and I believe
these belong to you...

1621
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,687
Our comics?

1622
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,200
Did you just pull that out
of the garbage can?

1623
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,850
Well, I read them...

1624
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,016
and considering
they're completely

1625
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,087
implausible, juvenile...

1626
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,208
and filled with
the lowest form of wit...

1627
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,731
potty humor...

1628
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,609
they're actually pretty funny.

1629
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,405
See ya later!

1630
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,288
Well, how about that...

1631
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,964
That's a good one.

1632
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,806
You know, it feels good to do
something nice for Mr. Krupp.

1633
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,803
Yeah, you know what? It does.

1634
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:53,976
Promise we'll never do it again.

1635
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,047
Promise.

1636
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,121
Oh, my!

1637
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,526
I've never been to

1638
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,329
such a fancy restaurant before.

1639
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,929
Well, I had to go all out
for m'lady.

1640
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,163
Okay, if you say so, my man!

1641
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,807
Once again,
that brings our story

1642
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,211
to its happy conclusion.

1643
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,480
I think there's some valuable
life lessons in there...

1644
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,521
somewhere.

1645
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,601
What the?

1646
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,171

01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,329
Yum, yum! Eat 'em up!

1649
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,766
Oh, no!

1650
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,085
Waiter! Check please!

1651
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,604
Principal Krupp!

1652
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,761
Oh, no!

1653
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,366
Help!

1654
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,081
Hang on, sidekicks!

1655
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,281
I don't get it!

1656
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,970
I really thought
breaking that ring

1657
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,690
would get rid of his powers!

1658
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,644
Yeah, well, here we go again!

1659

Tra-la-laa!

1660
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:14,007
<i>Are you worried
about impending doom?</i>

1661
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,726
<i>Those evil villains
got you filled with gloom</i>

1662
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,044
<i>But don? you fear,
there's a hero in the sky</i>

1663
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,049
<i>The sky, the sky</i>

1664
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,921
<i>it's not a bird</i>

1665
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,411
<i>And it's not a plane</i>

1666
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,526
<i>And it's not
an egg salad sandwich</i>

1667
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,842
<i>It's the waistband warrior</i>

1668
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,803
<i>Hear his mighty battle cry!</i>

1669

01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,724
<i>He's bustin' down doors</i>

1676
