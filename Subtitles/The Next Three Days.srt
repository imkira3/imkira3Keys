1
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,662
Please, get me to a hospital!

2
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,624
I can't breathe.

3
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,356
You know what? If you were smart,
you would stop talking right now.

4
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,902
Sue me. I just know that women
should never work for women.

5
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,069
How can you say that?

6
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,322
Because they're always threatened.

7
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,574
Especially if you're beautiful,
and they're not.

8
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,326
Fine! You never had a fight with your boss?

9
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,577
Never. You know why?

10
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,205
Because he's a man.

11
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,873
Can we please drop this?

12
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,876
I just want to go home and kiss my son.
Honey.

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,046
See, you have to mention
that you have a child and we don't.

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,882
- There's my point.
- Erit, I didn't say anything of the sort.

15
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,384
Don't apologize, it's genetics.

16
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,512
Women are always competing
with each other.

17
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,388
That's why you're having problems
with your boss.

18
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,682
- Because she's a woman.
- Exactly.

19
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,894
Women should work under men,
men under women. That's it.

20
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,312
What about men under men?

21
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,523
That's fine, too.
I mean, they can deal with it.

22
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,400
- Can we go now?
- Either of you guys want another drink?

23
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,568
- We're good.
- Shot? Double?

24
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,530
Women can do amazing things.
I am one. I know.

25
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,114
But even I would never work for me.

26
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,033
That we can agree on. Good night, Mick.

27
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,785
We are in a bad mood.

28
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,247
She's got a point, bro, you know.
I'd much rather work under you than her.

29
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,376
That's nice. I'd rather work under him, too.

30
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,379
You'd rather "work" under John?

31
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,798
You have a problem with that, too?

32
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,634
No! Why would I have a problem
with your little sexual innuendo?

33
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,885
What is up your ass tonight?

34
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,973
So I should just sit here while you come on
to my husband right in front of me?

35
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,893
Lara, if I wanted your husband,
I would have him, like that.

36
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,187
How? You couldn't possibly show him
more of those tits.

37
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,939
- You know what your problem is?
- Okay...

38
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,275
My problem is your brain
is as big as those tits.

39
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,734
- Baby, this is your fault!
- Huge, exactly!

40
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,819
This is your...

41
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,988
If you had half a brain,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

42
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,865
Baby. Let it go, let it go, let it go.

43
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,701
- Good night, brother dear!
- Good night!

44
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,537
- She's completely full of herself.
- Don't try and agree with me now!

45
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,372
I don't even think
she's a member of the dental profession.

46
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,748
Shut up!

47
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,710
She probably can't even
spell "anesthesiologist."

48
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,046
- The woman's a complete fraud.
- We went to her office party, you idiot!

49
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,382
And I believe she hit on me
that night as well.

50
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,052
You are completely delusional. She didn't
even hit on you in there. I just don't like her.

51
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,514
I understand your point of view. I really do.
I agree with you.

52
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,310
Somebody who looks like that should not
be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.

53
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,312
You are an asshole!

54
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,940
You're sitting in the chair,
you're trying to stay calm,

55
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,152
and you got them things
hanging in your face...

56
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,226
- So, see you next weekend. All right?
- Okay.

57
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,395
- Thank you.
- Good night.

58
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,855
- Bye.
- Bye!

59
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,106
Bye!

60
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,986
Oh, gee.

61
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Look at this.

62
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,837
- Now you say go.
- Go!

63
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,632
Smash.

64
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,384
All right, squeeze in.

65
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,886
You know, you can't do this every morning.
It's way too corny.

66
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,638
Come on. Smile.

67
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,724
It's just till he's 18.

68
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,854
- A present.
- Oh, great. What's that?

69
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,358
You hate brushing your teeth
and that brushes them in 30 seconds.

70
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,611
I love brushing my teeth.
Don't believe everything your mother says.

71
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,239
- What time's your last class?
- 3:00.

72
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,533
But I got some papers to grade.
Can you pick up Luke?

73
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:29,036
After yesterday,
I probably don't have a job anyway, so...

74
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,372
Was it wrong of me
to call her a useless cow?

75
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,710
I think bosses admire
that kind of frank exchange.

76
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,212
- Did you call your dad?
- When?

77
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,840
Birthday, yesterday!

78
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,301
Yeah, I sent him some freshly cut flowers,
little pink roses.

79
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,012
I sent him a handmade card.

80
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,015
And I finished that quilt I've been sewing
since spring.

81
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,142
You are completely impossible.

82
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,645
Did you notice what I got for my birthday
this year? I got a grunt.

83
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,982
Mom said, "Happy birthday, sweetheart,"
and Dad went...

84
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,609
It was just... It was a beautiful moment
in my life. I teared up.

85
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,488
Ever think that somebody has to be
the bigger person here?

86
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,116
Now I want you to remember this
for the custody hearing,

87
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,285
how Mommy is always
scolding Daddy, okay?

88
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,453
Can you remember that?

89
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,829
You know, how are you gonna feel

90
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,331
when Luke grows up
and doesn't call you on your birthday?

91
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,292
And now she's trying to drive a wedge
between us.

92
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,253
- I give up.
- And now she's abandoning you.

93
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,594
Hey, buddy, do you wanna try
and knock him over again?

94
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,056
You ready? Line it up.

95
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,019
- Line it up now and you say go.
- Go!

96
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,272
I got it.

97
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,986
Pittsburgh Police.
This is an arrest warrant for Lara Brennan...

98
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,155
- Arrest for what?
- ...and a search warrant for the premises.

99
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,364
- Hold on!
- Lara Brennan?

100
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,534
- You touch me again, I'm gonna arrest you.
- Hold on.

101
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,994
- Stay where you are!
- This is my house!

102
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,162
- Lara Brennan?
- Yes!

103
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,205
I will arrest you.

104
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,123
You're under arrest for the murder
of Elizabeth Gesas.

105
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,708
- Calm down!
- I got my kid in the kitchen!

106
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,251
What are you doing?
Arrest her for what?

107
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,295
- Turn around!
- Mommy!

108
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,797
- John! John!
- You have the right to an attorney...

109
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,340
Go get Luke. Go get Luke.

110
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,382
- ...understand these rights...
- Luke!

111
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,093
It's okay, buddy! It's okay!

112
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,303
- Mommy!
- Luke!

113
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,681
It's all right. It's okay!

114
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,984
Daddy! Daddy!

115
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,156
- Daddy!
- What's wrong? What's wrong, buddy?

116
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,241
What's wrong?

117
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,745
I got you.

118
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,547
Well, you can stay in here

119
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:51,512
as long as you sleep on this side of the bed,
all right?

120
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,059
You little snake.

121
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:02,231
I don't know why I keep falling
for the same old trick.

122
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,651
You have your tricks, don't you?

123
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,864
Hey, go to sleep.

124
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,700
Go to sleep.

125
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,218
- But Sam is your friend, right?
- Not at lunch.

126
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,264
- Why, does he steal your food?
- No.

127
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,103
- Did he say something mean? About Mom?
- Yeah.

128
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,774
- Did you hit him?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,277
Good. Where'd you hit him?

130
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,071
On the playground.

131
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,491
Wow! That must have hurt.

132
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,622
Hold it there, son.

133
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,419
It's a toy.

134
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,137
Thank you.

135
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,432
Hey. All right.

136
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,477
And the other arm.

137
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:25,606
Don't worry about the car.
We'll get it back later, okay?

138
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,333
Hey!

139
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,848
Hi, honey!

140
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,017
Hey.

141
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,230
You won't give Mommy a kiss?

142
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,857
Can Mommy please have a kiss?

143
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,277
Rat-bag. Give your mom a kiss.

144
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,408
- Is Daddy reading you my letters?
- Every night at bedtime.

145
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,659
Yeah?

146
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,290
You smell so good.

147
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,209
What are you gonna build today?

148
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,130
You gonna build a fort?

149
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,552
A door? Or a castle?

150
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,725
Hey.

151
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,236
Was he scared going to school?

152
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,740
No. I walked him to his class,
gave him a kiss, he just walked right in.

153
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,367
Didn't even turn back for a wave.

154
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,088
Look at his friends!

155
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,760
And his desk.

156
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,767
- How was your first day?
- Excellent.

157
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,103
Half the class stayed awake, you know.

158
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,065
- I talked to your mom.
- When is she coming?

159
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,571
She's having a lot of trouble
with her business, so...

160
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,577
Well, it's only been a couple of years,
I'm sure she'll get around to it.

161
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,499
Have you heard anything?

162
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,459
About the appeal?

163
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,545
Yeah, and I've just decided not to tell you.

164
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,090
- Remember what Meyer said.
- Don't.

165
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,218
It can take months for a court
to make a ruling.

166
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:03,389
I saw that woman. She was there.
She couldn't have just disappeared.

167
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,973
Meyer is looking for a new investigator.

168
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,018
Her coat snagged my purse,
and I felt that button pop,

169
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,645
and they're blind if they can't find it.

170
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,731
He's gonna go through
all the evidence again.

171
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,819
That's great,
because we're not quite bankrupt yet.

172
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,487
We're fine.

173
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,490
How you just lie and lie.

174
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,744
But you're so handsome.

175
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,252
Can you do me a favor?

176
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,503
I don't know, I'm kind of busy.

177
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,088
I need you to run for governor.

178
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,423
I can do that.

179
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,801
You can change this rule
about no conjugal visits,

180
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,971
'cause I don't think
I can last another 20 years.

181
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,348
Hey.

182
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,022
I'm okay.

183
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,110
- I'm okay.
- Everything is gonna be all right.

184
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,487
I promise.

185
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,080
You think he'll ever kiss me again?

186
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,056
I need you to stand up.

187
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:50,370
Tag, you're it.

188
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,418
Luke! Let's go, yard ape.

189
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,714
Hey.

190
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,050
- Have fun?
- Yeah.

191
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,135
She's kind of crazy, that little girl, right?

192
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,515
Time to go, Carrie!

193
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,100
No!

194
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,196
He didn't even read the thing. Half the time,
I'm telling you... We'll get him in there.

195
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,507
What happens if we find the woman
who was leaving the parking lot?

196
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,469
The PCRA has been rejected.

197
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,221
No new evidence can be submitted.
Not anymore.

198
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,348
It was a robbery.

199
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,476
And if they had used her credit card,
we could have argued that.

200
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,269
I'm... I'm sorry.

201
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,521
John...

202
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,983
This sucks.

203
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,487
Okay. That's that.

204
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,909
All we have now
is the Supreme Court, right?

205
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,788
John, in the last 30 years,

206
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,374
the Supreme Court
has not heard one murder case.

207
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,544
No decent lawyer
would even file the pleadings.

208
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:52,886
So, all I have to do is find an indecent one?
That shouldn't be too hard.

209
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,641
I'll file it.

210
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,187
But I need you to do something for me.

211
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,064
What?

212
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:09,528
I need you to look at the evidence
and forget that Lara's your wife.

213
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,156
I've seen the evidence, Meyer.

214
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:17,452
I'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty,
I'm just saying look at it.

215
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,832
Her co-worker sees her leaving the scene,

216
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:26,002
the victim's blood is on her clothes,
her fingerprints are on the murder weapon.

217
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,129
And then we went out to dinner.

218
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,090
How do you do that
if you just killed somebody?

219
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,299
That would make her a psychopath.

220
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,176
- And the fight...
- Is Lara a psychopath?

221
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,429
- The fight in the office?
- Everyone fights with their boss!

222
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,639
But this one ended up dead.

223
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:42,185
So what you're saying is that
you never believed in her innocence?

224
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,146
- How can you say that?
- What are you saying, Meyer?

225
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,274
I'm saying that it no longer matters
what we believe,

226
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,735
Lara is not getting out!

227
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,953
And you have no idea
how much I hate to say that.

228
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,918
I will find someone to file the pleadings.

229
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,003
John.

230
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,422
John, come on. John!

231
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:11,965
John!

232
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,051
John! For Christ's sakes!

233
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,271
Come on.

234
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,398
We'll find Scout, okay?

235
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,375
Thank you.

236
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:32,105
"And give a big hug to Pengui,
Little Pengui, Kiki and Opossumy.

237
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,066
"Lots and lots of love, Mommy."

238
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,277
Should we write her back?

239
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,448
Can I have a quarter?

240
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,576
Can you have a quarter?

241
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,165
Yeah, but you know you can't spend these.

242
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,793
Because they come from the cottage
where Mom and I used to take you

243
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,712
when you were a baby.

244
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,298
Then can I have them all?

245
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,634
Sure.

246
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,700
My wife, Lara Brennan,
she was sent up here.

247
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,245
- Brennan, B-R-E-N-N-A-N.
- I'm sorry, but she can't have visitors.

248
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,622
That's ridiculous. I have to see her.

249
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,165
- Lara! Lara!
- I'm sorry.

250
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,249
You can't go down there!

251
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,127
- You can't be in here!
- Hey, hey, stop. Stop right there.

252
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,545
- Where you going? Hey, come back here.
- Lara!

253
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,130
- Lara!
- Sir!

254
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,924
- What the hell is going on?
- My wife attempted suicide.

255
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,467
They brought her up here.
I have to see her, please.

256
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,427
- She's not allowed visitors.
- So why isn't she in the ER?

257
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,472
- Because she's a transfer from County Jail.
- Just two minutes, please.

258
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,892
Two minutes.

259
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,397
Okay.

260
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,233
Thank you.

261
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,534
Two minutes.

262
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,242
So, The Life and Times of Don Quixote.

263
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,162
What is it about?

264
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:56,916
That someone's belief in virtue
is more important than virtue itself?

265
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,337
Yes, that's in there. But what is it about?

266
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:08,595
Could it be about
how rational thought destroys your soul?

267
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:14,976
Could it be about the triumph of irrationality
and the power that's in that?

268
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,980
You know, we spend a lot of time
trying to organize the world.

269
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:23,109
We build clocks and calendars
and we try and predict the weather.

270
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,699
But what part of our life
is truly under our control?

271
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,135
What if we choose to exist purely
in a reality of our own making?

272
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,140
Does that render us insane?

273
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,150
And if it does,
isn't that better than a life of despair?

274
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:19,499
It's a course that investigates what
drives men to be free, no matter the cost.

275
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,586
Some other teacher had dibs on Papillon?

276
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,550
You escaped from jail seven times.

277
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,594
What do you want to know?

278
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,097
How you escaped when no one else could.

279
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,432
Balls and a little luck.

280
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,768
No prison in the world is airtight.

281
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,521
Each one has a key. You just have to find it.

282
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,148
How do you do that?

283
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,400
A lot of looking.

284
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,778
Especially at things
that break up the daily routine.

285
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,782
Guards get comfortable
doing the same thing day in, day out.

286
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,493
Something happens,
that's when they make mistakes.

287
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:58,413
When you see it, you have to be ready.

288
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,957
You have to have the entire plan
already in place,

289
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,918
even before you know
how you're going to get out of jail.

290
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:07,130
Escaping is easy,
the hardest part is staying free.

291
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:12,051
You have to know where you're gonna go
and how you're gonna get there.

292
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:15,930
You have to know how they plan
to catch you, where and when.

293
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,850
Well, how the hell
are you supposed to know that?

294
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,019
You pay off someone who knows.

295
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,897
And a lot depends on
if the prison is in the country or the city.

296
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,064
City.

297
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,578
Where are you from?

298
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,080
Pittsburgh.

299
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,252
Pittsburgh's tough.

300
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,340
So many bridges and tunnels
they can block off.

301
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,800
From the time they make the call,

302
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,888
the police can have the center of the city
sealed tight in 15 minutes.

303
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,473
How can they be so exact?

304
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,018
After 9/11, Homeland Security
made every city have a lockdown plan.

305
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:06,606
Downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston,
Minneapolis, 15 minutes.

306
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,900
They can do D.C. in under 10.

307
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:13,112
Within 35 minutes, they can have cops
at every tollbooth on the interstate

308
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,990
and be running rolling stops
on the secondary roads.

309
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,743
They won't have your photograph yet,
but they will have your description.

310
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,830
What if you can't get out?
Thirty-five minutes is not a lot of time.

311
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:23,915
Then surrender.

312
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:28,461
Because they will shoot you on sight,
along with anyone else you're with.

313
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,464
Stay far away
from the train and bus stations.

314
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,259
Forget the local airports.
Leave from another state.

315
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:38,137
Second, identity.
It's easy to find fake papers,

316
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,974
harder to find ones
that will get you through an airport.

317
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:45,520
You'll need a passport, a driver's license
and a social security number.

318
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,023
If you have to rent a car,
find a place that will take a cash deposit.

319
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:53,486
They'll still run a credit check,
so use a real person's name on the ID.

320
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,238
Third, destination.

321
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,407
You want somewhere
that doesn't attract American tourists.

322
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,119
Think Yemen, and you get the idea.

323
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,372
And money, you'll need a truckload of it.

324
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,959
Everything's expensive,
hotels, travel, information.

325
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,794
How much?

326
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,171
Enough to last at least five, six years.

327
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:15,383
You run out of money,
you run out of friends.

328
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:23,433
But before you do anything,
you have to ask yourself if you can do it.

329
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,561
Can you forget about ever seeing
your parents again?

330
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,398
Can you kill a guard?
Leave your kid at a gas station?

331
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,734
Push some nice old lady to the ground

332
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,861
just because she gets
between you and the door?

333
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:38,614
Because to do this thing,
that's who you have to become.

334
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,535
And if you can't, don't start,

335
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,539
'cause you'll just get someone killed.

336
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,375
How did you get caught?

337
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,339
I gave myself up.

338
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:00,636
I couldn't take wondering when someone
was gonna come through the bedroom door.

339
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,809
So, what do you have in your pocket?

340
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,369
Good luck.

341
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,937
No prison in the world is airtight.

342
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,356
Each one has a key. You just have to find it.

343
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,109
How do you do that?

344
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,444
A lot of looking.

345
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,363
Especially at things
that break up the daily routine.

346
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:58,004
And on the left, the Allegheny County Jail,
now the largest jail in the world.

347
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:01,340
There have been three escape attempts
of which no one has made it out alive.

348
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,468
If you look to the right, south side...

349
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:10,099
"On the first landing, which was as small
as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed,

350
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,768
"there was a niche in the column,
about half a yard wide,

351
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:16,314
"and in this niche, the prince felt
convinced that a man stood concealed.

352
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,192
"He thought he could distinguish
a figure standing there..."

353
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,034
25, 26, 27,

354
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,912
28, 29, 30.

355
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,415
Good?

356
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,711
And money, you'll need a truckload of it.

357
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,590
Everything's expensive,
hotels, travel, information.

358
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,596
It's gonna take our selection.

359
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,973
Then we're gonna wanna use
our magic lasso tool

360
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,017
to get the door out of the background.

361
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,485
Hey.

362
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,333
Identity. It's easy to find fake papers,

363
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,836
harder to find ones
that will get you through an airport.

364
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,573
- OxyContin.
- $10 apiece.

365
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,158
Give you five for $40.

366
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,963
Hey, I need some passports.

367
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,425
Piss off, man! Beat your feet.

368
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:15,975
Okay, boy!

369
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,449
You got to pay upfront for the passports, yo.

370
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,827
- I can do that.
- You know the Hotel Lafayette?

371
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:40,041
It's on Main Street. When you get there,
go to the bar, ask for Harv.

372
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,792
What's your name?

373
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,128
Tell him Mouss sent you.

374
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,855
Harv? I'm looking for Harv.

375
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,830
- Are you Harv?
- Yeah.

376
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,042
Mouss told me to come and see you.

377
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,002
He did, did he? What do you want?

378
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:32,802
Three passports, a driver's license,
and a real social security number.

379
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,429
How do you know Mouss?

380
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,099
He babysits my kid.

381
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,269
Okay, follow me.

382
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,453
- You got the photos on you?
- Yeah.

383
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,415
- How much?
- $1,500.

384
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:20,266
If I ever see your face again,
you're gonna lose an eye.

385
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,472
Yeah, it was stupid. I fell off the bike.

386
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,684
You mean the bike that's been in our garage
for two years?

387
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,644
Put your head back.

388
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,775
Some guy made a crack about Lara.

389
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,069
So that's what you do now? You punch
everybody who thinks she's guilty?

390
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,654
What's that supposed to mean?

391
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,032
It means it's important what you believe,

392
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,617
- not what somebody else...
- Really?

393
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,203
- Do you believe, Mom?
- Why are you trying to start a fight?

394
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,913
Come on, buddy. Let's go. Where's his bag?

395
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,165
- Why are you doing this?
- No reason.

396
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,833
I just stupidly thought that the people
who loved her

397
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,294
would actually believe she's innocent.
My mistake.

398
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,462
Stop this!

399
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,969
Go give Grandma a kiss.

400
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,016
Come on.

401
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,295
Does your face hurt?

402
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,340
A little.

403
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,260
Did you hit him back?

404
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,473
No, I... I didn't.

405
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,725
That's okay.

406
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,029
Okay, buddy?

407
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:08,475
I'm looking for someone
who does high-end IDs.

408
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,686
Passports, social security cards.

409
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,479
Get out of here.

410
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,146
Yeah?

411
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:58,609
I was at the bar.
I know what you are looking for.

412
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,866
I'm deaf, you idiot. I read your lips.

413
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,172
What do you need?

414
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,550
Passports, driver's license,

415
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:27,304
a social security number
that'll take a credit check.

416
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,975
$3,700.

417
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,227
That's too much.

418
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,729
It is if you never get them.

419
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,276
I need photos and $1,000 in advance.

420
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,875
- I'll bring them Wednesday.
- Hey, not here.

421
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,004
I don't want you coming back here again.

422
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:08,554
Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street.
Under the bridge, 2:00.

423
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,765
If I'm not there on time, leave.

424
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,441
Put your thumb right there.

425
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,737
- Thanks. That's all I need.
- Thank you.

426
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,785
I'll just be a few moments.

427
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,873
Glasses?

428
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:19,958
Yes.

429
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,296
Yeah, I found myself falling asleep
grading papers.

430
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,631
When?

431
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,675
I guess about a year ago.

432
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,970
A year ago.

433
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:38,477
Look at you.
How can you do this to yourself?

434
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,357
I am hopeless without my wife.

435
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,110
I can't even ride a bike.

436
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,988
Sorry about the house.

437
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:57,329
I won't know where to picture you.

438
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:04,294
I close my eyes, I see Luke in his bedroom,
and you on the sofa by the window.

439
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,634
I won't know where to picture you anymore.

440
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,068
Show me where the bullets go.

441
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,780
Hi, it's John.

442
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,198
Luke's not feeling too well.

443
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:36,577
So I'm gonna pick him up
and take him home, okay?

444
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,705
I need Carl to cover my 3:00 class.

445
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,166
Thanks.

446
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,587
You ever gonna answer
your goddamn phone?

447
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,553
You were supposed to leave.

448
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,556
I need them.

449
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,476
You notice that guy was a cop?

450
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,733
Just give me the money.

451
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,119
You want this too much.

452
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,997
You're gonna fuck it up.

453
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,408
Hey, Mr. Brennan.

454
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:47,457
Today I'm gonna show you
how to make a key that can open any lock.

455
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,251
It's called a bump key.

456
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,628
First thing you need to do
is you need to find a key

457
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:54,298
that can fit into the type of lock
that you're trying to open.

458
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,758
Here I have a key
that fits into my front door,

459
00:43:56,843 --> 00:44:00,721
but I just changed the locks,
so it won't open.

460
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,432
First thing you need to do
is secure your key,

461
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:08,020
take a metal file and go through and
start taking those mountains and valleys

462
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,689
all the way down
to the lowest possible setting on the key.

463
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,317
The bump key works
by momentarily bumping those pins up,

464
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,526
so that for a split second,

465
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:19,197
the chamber is cleared of pins
and thus, able to turn and open.

466
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,510
- Here you go.
- Don't touch that.

467
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,762
- Sorry.
- Trying to do my job?

468
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,066
So you are where in here?

469
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,030
I'm in the middle there.

470
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:08,533
In the middle. Can you point to yourself?

471
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,202
That's me.

472
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,661
There.

473
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,543
So that's not you back there
by the elevators.

474
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:22,797
No, no, I was around here somewhere.

475
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,885
You wanna tell me what's going on?

476
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,305
You want me to tell you?

477
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,059
Yes.

478
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,896
Do you know what a bump key is?

479
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,190
Sorry?

480
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,533
If this was you,

481
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,328
you might wanna think about
what's gonna happen to your kids

482
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,664
if both their parents end up in prison.

483
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:05,168
Dad?

484
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,049
Dad!

485
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,718
Yeah, bud.

486
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,970
Yeah.

487
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,350
Thanks.

488
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:26,773
So we arrested his wife, and now
we're gonna charge the man with vomiting.

489
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,735
He's selling the house. Or he has a buyer.

490
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:34,239
In this market? Lucky man.

491
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:38,118
Can we possibly go do police work now?

492
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,082
I don't know how you managed
to stay single this long.

493
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,556
Dad, can I have my cookies?

494
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,184
- You hungry? You want a sandwich?
- No.

495
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,564
- There you go.
- Thanks.

496
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,280
Carrie!

497
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:20,285
I'm sorry.
She's just already got it all figured out.

498
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,872
Nicole.

499
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,791
- I remember.
- Really?

500
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,128
I remember your daughter.

501
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,672
Well, she's hard to forget.

502
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:47,270
Luke was supposed to bring this home.

503
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,522
He has his father's memory.

504
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:54,736
It's for Carrie's birthday party.
Please, come. I'd love to meet your wife.

505
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,864
She won't be there.

506
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,992
It's complicated.

507
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,829
I understand. With me, too.

508
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,375
Carrie, come on, let's go.

509
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,963
We're gonna grab a bite to eat.
Would you like to come?

510
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,258
- No, I don't... We're kind of...
- Busy?

511
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,555
Come on. We owe you for the cookies.

512
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,142
Well, that's true.

513
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,603
And I did make those cookies myself.

514
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,688
And learned how to pre-package them.

515
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,571
Come on, Luke.

516
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,952
So, do you trade off time with Luke?

517
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:46,746
No, Luke and I are together full-time.

518
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:49,999
Wow. I guess that's why I see you so much.

519
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:54,295
She'd like nothing better than to be here,
with him.

520
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,590
Lara, she... She misses all this.

521
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,511
I guess it's all about priorities, isn't it?

522
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,768
No, she's not like that.

523
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,688
She's in prison.

524
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:17,986
- I don't tell most people.
- I understand.

525
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,863
She's innocent. She didn't kill that woman.

526
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,324
Good. I mean...

527
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:26,411
I'm sure she didn't.

528
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,499
We really should be going home.

529
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:32,834
Okay.

530
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:36,921
Thank you very much for the invitation.
We'll try and make it.

531
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,798
That would be great.

532
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,259
- Goodbye. Luke!
- Bye.

533
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,428
Come on.

534
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,604
Carrie, come on!

535
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,899
- Hey.
- Hey.

536
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,526
What's wrong?

537
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,612
What is it?

538
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:39,497
No.

539
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,251
They can't move you without notice.

540
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,336
Three days isn't notice.

541
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:49,674
I was only here through the appeal.
We knew I was going to a prison.

542
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,932
No, no, I don't have two weeks.
I gotta close the escrow tomorrow.

543
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,852
Well, the title hasn't even been cleared yet.
I mean, there's no way I can...

544
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,186
How much can they give me?

545
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:03,688
Nothing!

546
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,385
What are you doing here?

547
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,095
I've got class.

548
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,058
You be good, okay?

549
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,230
Thanks.

550
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,305
Are you okay? You're okay?

551
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,723
- Are you okay?
- What are you doing?

552
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,016
You almost killed us!

553
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,184
I'm so, so sorry.

554
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:07,019
You're out of your mind. You don't look.

555
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,231
Get away. Get away from us!

556
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,766
Hey.

557
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,024
What's wrong?

558
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:54,108
Nothing.

559
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:55,860
Is it Luke?

560
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:57,403
- No.
- What?

561
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,951
I... I asked Meyer

562
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,996
to look into not having you moved.

563
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:12,960
I told him that traveling that distance
would be a hardship on us,

564
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:15,129
that Luke was already having problems
at school, which is true.

565
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,214
I haven't been spending
enough time with him.

566
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:19,175
You haven't?

567
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:20,593
No.

568
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,970
You haven't?

569
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:27,683
Jesus, John.

570
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:31,771
You really are too much.

571
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:36,692
Luke is having a hard time,
because Mommy's in jail for murder,

572
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:40,196
not because Daddy doesn't spend
enough time with him.

573
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,909
Your father was right. You really don't
live in the same world we do.

574
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,997
That's nice, that the two of you talk.

575
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,792
What world do I live in, Lara?

576
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:55,461
Well, I don't know, John,
but it's not the real one.

577
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,838
The one in which I'm in here
for the rest of my life.

578
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:01,550
So don't be talking to me about fantasies
like there's some happily ever...

579
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:03,344
We good here?

580
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,015
Yes. Sorry.

581
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:23,572
Now you're gonna sit here all long-faced,
like you let me down.

582
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:26,534
I mean, what do you want me to do here?
You want me to make you feel better?

583
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:27,827
Got it.

584
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,121
I'm sorry.

585
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:31,789
Now you're apologizing.

586
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,833
You really are a gem.

587
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:37,044
- What do you want from me, Lara?
- What do I want from you? Nothing.

588
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:38,879
You're already too perfect.

589
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:42,007
You know,
you never even asked me if I did it.

590
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:45,136
- If I killed her.
- Because I know you didn't.

591
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,304
Well, then you'd be wrong.

592
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,778
I'm done.

593
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,357
Sir, you can't stand there.

594
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:43,986
Sir, I need you to leave the building now.

595
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:45,821
Sir?

596
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:04,798
- What?
- Shut up.

597
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:09,470
I don't care what you say or how you say it.

598
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:12,806
I don't believe you did it.

599
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,310
And I never will.

600
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:22,733
I know who you are.

601
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,112
And I promise you

602
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,950
this will not be your life.

603
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,438
Shut up!

604
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,578
- I don't know what's going on, man.
- You done?

605
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:03,662
Everybody is out.

606
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:05,664
I gotta get back to Jimmy.

607
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,918
Back away! Back away!

608
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:13,797
Drop the gun! Drop it!

609
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,507
Put the dog away!

610
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:16,967
You shoot the dog, I'll kill you!

611
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,220
- You want the police here, asshole?
- Good idea!

612
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:24,892
Get in, get in, get in!

613
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,560
- You, too!
- I'm not getting in there!

614
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:28,312
Get in there!

615
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:29,396
Get in! Get in! Get in!

616
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:34,234
All right, lock it. Lock the door.

617
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:37,905
- Move!
- You are dead.

618
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:39,782
- I didn't do anything.
- You brought him here!

619
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,366
I didn't bring him!

620
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,537
On your knees! On the floor!

621
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:55,005
All right. Where's your money?

622
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:59,885
Here. It's worth it to get rid of you.

623
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,804
- Where's the rest?
- Here.

624
01:09:02,514 --> 01:09:04,348
- Take more.
- Where do you keep your money?

625
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,266
I'm gonna give my money to you. Yeah.

626
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,310
- I'll shoot you.
- You can't even shoot a dog.

627
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,103
- I'll kill you both!
- No, I'm gonna kill you both!

628
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:12,981
- Just give him your money!
- Keep your dead bitch mouth shut!

629
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,066
Give him your money!

630
01:09:14,526 --> 01:09:15,567
Jesus!

631
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:23,450
See? You ain't gonna kill me.

632
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,203
This is the worst you could do?

633
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:31,291
Go home.
I'll come, I'll find you and I'll kill you.

634
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:42,386
You're wasting some good shit there!

635
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,470
Yeah, good shit.

636
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,805
High alcohol content.

637
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:52,437
What are you gonna do?
You gonna burn me out?

638
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,773
Yeah. That's what I'm gonna do.

639
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:55,899
Jesus Christ!

640
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:57,818
This is a meth lab, you idiot!

641
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,361
No.

642
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:01,405
It was.

643
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:04,533
Tell me! Where's your money?

644
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:08,495
My kid is upstairs!

645
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:11,832
- Get up!
- Jesus!

646
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,166
Get up!

647
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,272
Please.

648
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:38,442
Please, let me go, please.

649
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:19,858
Anybody here?

650
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,388
Don't leave me here.

651
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,182
I don't wanna die here.

652
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,605
Please!

653
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,268
Please, get me to a hospital!

654
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,522
I can't breathe.

655
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:47,237
Please.

656
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:55,871
I can't breathe.

657
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,836
I can't... I can't...

658
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:18,411
Get out of my way.

659
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,378
- What do we have?
- A freaking miracle.

660
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,256
Meth lab in the basement,
the house still standing.

661
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,091
Should be just a crater.

662
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,259
We know him?

663
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:35,846
Alex Gaidar,
history of violence and drug trafficking.

664
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:46,815
He have a kid?

665
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,151
Neighbor said wife left with him last year.

666
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,319
Big surprise there.

667
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,363
And this blood,

668
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:57,617
they type it all yet?

669
01:14:57,702 --> 01:15:00,787
No, but someone left through
the back door bleeding.

670
01:15:00,872 --> 01:15:04,541
Zone Three found a gunshot victim dead
on a transit bench.

671
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:51,796
Hey.

672
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,759
I've just come to pick up Luke.

673
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:57,469
He's sound asleep.

674
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:02,599
Yeah, I've just come to get Luke.

675
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:08,438
John.

676
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,443
Are you all right?

677
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,737
Yeah. I'm fine.

678
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:27,791
Hey, buddy.

679
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,502
Wake up, bud, we're going home.

680
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,191
So, what do you say?

681
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:38,069
Thank you, Grandma.

682
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:39,821
I think you should give Grandma a big kiss.

683
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:42,032
- I'm too tired for kisses.
- Buddy.

684
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:45,994
That's okay.
I'll get lots of kisses next weekend.

685
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:48,788
We want to take him
to the Fall Festival in Kutztown

686
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:50,874
where the Clydesdales are.

687
01:17:55,046 --> 01:17:56,838
- See you.
- Bye.

688
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,050
Bye.

689
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,053
Hey.

690
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:08,850
- Bye, Grandpa.
- Bye.

691
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:27,619
Goodbye.

692
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:40,924
Bye, Mom.

693
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,467
Bye.

694
01:19:03,114 --> 01:19:05,281
You're getting sentimental in your old age.

695
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,450
Yeah.

696
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,288
Well, might as well have some coffee.

697
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,480
Yo! Idiots!

698
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:43,653
Can I carry him?

699
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:46,906
No, bud. Only what fits in the bag, all right?

700
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:54,497
What about my pockets?

701
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:56,207
Or your pockets.

702
01:21:24,964 --> 01:21:29,968
Hello?

703
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:56,953
Bud? I'll be back in a moment, okay?

704
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:58,037
Okay.

705
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:34,157
Hey, bud.

706
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:36,326
So...

707
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:38,911
You all right?

708
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:40,997
Yeah.

709
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,293
They're calling all the party animals.

710
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:48,129
922 Yetta Street.

711
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,006
I know where that is.

712
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:52,508
Okay? Here we go.

713
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,572
Yeah, taillight matches
any 2004 to 2009 Prius.

714
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:17,325
What kind of criminal drives a Prius?

715
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:18,785
A socially responsible one.

716
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:22,705
There's over 1 ,000 registered in the city,
7,000 in the state.

717
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:26,376
- How many are registered to felons?
- Six in the state.

718
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:30,797
Four to embezzlers, white-collar criminals,
one to a rapist, one to a murderer.

719
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:33,675
- Start with the murderer.
- She's in prison for life.

720
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:35,134
Rapist is out.

721
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:40,431
Find him.

722
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,267
Come on.

723
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:49,899
- Hello.
- Hi.

724
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,111
- Good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

725
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:59,826
- Hi, Luke.
- It's a pony.

726
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:02,787
Those aren't easy to wrap.

727
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:08,251
- You know the party is not until 11:00, right?
- Really?

728
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:13,715
What is it? Around 9:00? I'm sorry.
I should've read it more carefully.

729
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:17,343
It's no problem.
Why don't you go give this to Carrie?

730
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:22,140
Well, I guess you can help.

731
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:24,517
Actually, I've gotta go
and run some errands.

732
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:26,602
Sorry.

733
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:31,274
We'll see you later then.

734
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:34,277
Thanks so much.

735
01:24:39,533 --> 01:24:41,868
He has my parents' phone number.

736
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:45,371
In his jacket. Top pocket of his jacket.

737
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:49,959
If I'm running late.

738
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:52,128
No problem.

739
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:05,892
The rapist is in a wheelchair.
Not sure if that was karma or just bad luck.

740
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:08,186
The murderer. Where is she incarcerated?

741
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:09,812
County, right here in town.

742
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:13,316
Does she have a husband
or a kid old enough to drive?

743
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:28,873
Yes? What?

744
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:31,501
Lara Brennan's blood work.

745
01:25:34,797 --> 01:25:36,130
Get the lab.

746
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:45,723
You pissed somebody off, that's for sure.

747
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:53,648
- It's still busy. I'll keep trying.
- No. Get an ambulance.

748
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:57,693
Take her to University Hospital.
I'll meet them there.

749
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:01,489
Right. Thanks.

750
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:03,241
Husband, schoolteacher.

751
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,035
You got a home address?

752
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:15,021
No car in the garage.
You want to get a warrant?

753
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:16,272
Yeah.

754
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:47,845
Get the warrant.

755
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:33,766
Lara Brennan's being transferred
to University Hospital.

756
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,309
- Right now?
- Right now.

757
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:37,603
Have them call the escort vehicle.

758
01:28:37,688 --> 01:28:39,647
Tell them we'll meet them at the hospital
in less than 10.

759
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:48,030
Yeah. Yeah, we're here.
Prisoner's secure. No problems.

760
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:50,866
Will do.

761
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:53,494
Hands where I can see 'em.

762
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:54,870
John?

763
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:56,205
And the phone.

764
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:57,665
What are you doing here, John?

765
01:28:57,749 --> 01:28:59,000
Put your hands on your head.

766
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:01,210
John, what are you doing?

767
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:03,546
Uncuff her. Kneel down.

768
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,049
John, stop this.

769
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:09,468
Kneel down. Face the wall.

770
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,809
Unit 2242 secure.

771
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:19,437
- She just said...
- Just take the light.

772
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:26,569
Hands and feet, pull 'em as tight as you can.

773
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:29,989
You walk out that door with him,
you will both be dead.

774
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:31,490
- Shut up.
- John, he's right.

775
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,868
Listen to him. You're gonna get us killed.

776
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,495
- Why are you doing this?
- Because we have no other choice!

777
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:37,955
- Put 'em on.
- No. That's not true!

778
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,331
- Put the clothes on, Lara.
- No.

779
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:40,875
- Now!
- No!

780
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:42,877
Okay.

781
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:46,630
You call your son
and tell him you're not coming.

782
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:47,965
- Where is he?
- He's waiting for you.

783
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:49,300
You wanna tell him you're not coming?

784
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:51,469
- How can you do this to me?
- Push "send."

785
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:52,928
Tell him I'm not coming, either.

786
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,057
- John.
- Does it look like I'm going home, Lara?

787
01:29:56,850 --> 01:30:01,771
You call him, tell him he's alone now
and his mom and dad are not coming back.

788
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:04,940
Jesus, John.

789
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:08,110
You son of a bitch.

790
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:23,709
I'm Dr. Lifson.
You've got a patient here from County Jail.

791
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:24,835
Lara Brennan?

792
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,297
Yes, we started an IV.
D50 with 20 units of insulin.

793
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:37,348
Copy.

794
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:48,317
Security!

795
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:52,279
Out! Out!

796
01:31:20,851 --> 01:31:22,059
- Hey, hey.
- Back away!

797
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:23,352
- Now don't be stupid.
- You stay back!

798
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:26,397
We have units at every exit, John.
You will be shot trying to leave.

799
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:27,439
Hit the button, Lara.

800
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:29,024
- Stop.
- Hit the button!

801
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:30,901
John, do not do this.

802
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:34,321
- Where are the stairs?
- There.

803
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:37,366
Male and female, white lab coats,
parking levels.

804
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,578
Hey. It's gonna be okay.

805
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:45,583
Look at me, look at me.
Everything's gonna be okay.

806
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:49,378
Just do what I say when I say it.
Everything will be okay.

807
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:52,256
Lara, take the coat off.

808
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:54,675
Come on.

809
01:31:57,637 --> 01:31:59,388
It's okay. You stay here.

810
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:00,598
All security personnel...

811
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:14,904
- Watch the door!
- Yeah.

812
01:32:48,772 --> 01:32:49,939
Stop.

813
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:51,941
Shit.

814
01:32:52,943 --> 01:32:53,943
Who's in the lobby?

815
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,531
Hey, listen. Is anybody in the lobby?

816
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:17,216
Don't look.

817
01:33:19,678 --> 01:33:20,719
Run!

818
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:23,931
Great!

819
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:25,015
Back here!

820
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:31,480
Move.

821
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:36,777
Let's get moving!

822
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:41,949
Come on.

823
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:49,373
Here!

824
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:06,140
Hey, hey!

825
01:34:11,855 --> 01:34:13,272
Go Penguins!

826
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:15,149
Let your hair down.

827
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:25,909
Harris, that way. Go!

828
01:34:41,468 --> 01:34:42,593
Hey!

829
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:01,653
Harris, they're in the subway.
Harris! The subway!

830
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:02,738
Got it.

831
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:16,210
They're on the platform!

832
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:20,422
Block stations in either directions!
Call the Port Authority. Stop all the trains!

833
01:35:35,522 --> 01:35:37,106
Wait, wait, wait.

834
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:39,775
What are we doing?

835
01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:45,948
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

836
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:51,203
Move! Pittsburgh PD!

837
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:56,542
The train on track four, I want it stopped.
Stop that train!

838
01:36:09,556 --> 01:36:11,557
Next stop...

839
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:48,760
Hold on to me.

840
01:36:48,845 --> 01:36:50,512
Hey, kid, two hands.

841
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,194
No. No.

842
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:14,953
This way.

843
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,081
There.

844
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:04,628
- Red light.
- Hold on.

845
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:06,088
Red light!

846
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:33,198
Ring the city. Close bus and train stations.

847
01:38:33,283 --> 01:38:35,367
And get their description
to the state police.

848
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:36,410
Copy that.

849
01:38:36,494 --> 01:38:38,870
- How old is their damn kid?
- Six.

850
01:38:39,289 --> 01:38:41,248
Find out where he is.

851
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:48,338
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You would've stopped me.

852
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,550
Your insulin is in here.

853
01:38:51,634 --> 01:38:54,177
There's a case in here.
It's got a brush, moisturizer, makeup.

854
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:57,222
Everything you had was old.
I hope I got it right.

855
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:09,484
You remember where you last saw him?

856
01:39:09,569 --> 01:39:12,571
You want to take a guess
who just escaped from jail?

857
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:13,697
Hold on a second.

858
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:22,122
- Hello.
- Hi. I'm here to pick up my son.

859
01:39:22,206 --> 01:39:23,498
They aren't back yet.

860
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:26,585
Back from where?

861
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:28,170
From the zoo.

862
01:39:31,341 --> 01:39:32,591
It's a zoo party.

863
01:39:34,177 --> 01:39:37,262
They should be back in about an hour
if you'd like to wait.

864
01:39:37,347 --> 01:39:38,847
No. Thank you.

865
01:39:43,311 --> 01:39:45,354
What's wrong? What is it?

866
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:48,982
- Where is he? Where's Luke?
- He's at the party.

867
01:39:49,067 --> 01:39:50,901
What party? You said the party was here.

868
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:53,862
I was wrong. She's taken them to the zoo.

869
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:58,867
- Destination, Pittsburgh Zoo.
- She?

870
01:39:59,369 --> 01:40:02,996
Estimated drive time, 17 minutes.

871
01:40:03,081 --> 01:40:05,082
Carrie's mother, Nicole.

872
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:27,646
Check the neighbors!

873
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:31,024
We're looking for the boy and anything
they've noticed in the last few days.

874
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:41,887
Time to destination, 11 minutes.

875
01:41:48,811 --> 01:41:51,813
In 1 ,000 feet, bear left.

876
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:01,615
In 500 feet, bear left.

877
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,124
In 100 feet, bear left.

878
01:42:15,004 --> 01:42:16,379
Bear left.

879
01:42:24,347 --> 01:42:26,473
You took the wrong turn.

880
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,350
John, the zoo's behind us.
You took the wrong turn.

881
01:42:28,434 --> 01:42:29,434
Babe, what are you doing?

882
01:42:29,519 --> 01:42:30,602
She'll call my parents.

883
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:32,562
- What?
- They'll look after him,

884
01:42:32,647 --> 01:42:34,481
and I'll figure out a way of getting him to us.

885
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:35,690
Are you out of your mind?

886
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:37,192
I tried! There's no more time!

887
01:42:37,276 --> 01:42:39,236
Any second now,
there's gonna be a roadblock ahead of us.

888
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:42,572
It might be there now!
If we don't get out now, we don't get out!

889
01:42:42,657 --> 01:42:46,034
I'll find a way of getting him to us, all right?
I'll find a way.

890
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:19,873
No, really, it's fine. I just can't thank you
enough for taking care of him.

891
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:21,166
Hey, it was our pleasure.

892
01:46:48,569 --> 01:46:49,694
Hi.

893
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:24,813
I'm going to sit back here, okay?

894
01:47:26,816 --> 01:47:27,816
Sure.

895
01:48:09,692 --> 01:48:12,110
The traffic is backing up at the toll plazas.

896
01:48:12,194 --> 01:48:14,904
It's worse downtown where police
have cordoned off the train station

897
01:48:14,989 --> 01:48:16,781
and are searching all passengers.

898
01:48:16,866 --> 01:48:19,784
Joining us from Union Station,
our very own Sylvia Patterson.

899
01:48:19,869 --> 01:48:20,869
John?

900
01:48:25,791 --> 01:48:27,709
What are we gonna do?

901
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:40,430
We're going to the train station.

902
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:24,307
- Stay in the car.
- Okay.

903
01:50:06,976 --> 01:50:12,730
Sir, I'm sorry the mayor was delayed,
but I did not tell them to stop every vehicle.

904
01:50:12,815 --> 01:50:15,608
Just the ones with a couple and a child.

905
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:17,819
Sir, I know my...

906
01:50:19,321 --> 01:50:20,655
Yes, sir.

907
01:50:58,569 --> 01:51:03,156
Are you sure $20 is enough?
Ticket to Buffalo costs three times that.

908
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:07,285
Yeah. We're going that way anyway.

909
01:52:08,347 --> 01:52:13,059
Go wider. Send their photos to every train,
bus station and airport in a 300-mile radius.

910
01:52:13,143 --> 01:52:15,978
So Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia,

911
01:52:16,063 --> 01:52:19,774
New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Michigan,
Kentucky and Indiana?

912
01:52:20,359 --> 01:52:22,568
You know what direction they're going in,
smart-ass?

913
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:36,124
- See you again, Tom.
- Thanks again.

914
01:52:50,222 --> 01:52:51,305
You want to see it?

915
01:52:51,557 --> 01:52:53,307
Only if it will tell me where they are.

916
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,143
Not so lucky.

917
01:53:16,165 --> 01:53:18,833
Excuse me. Do you call this coffee?

918
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:29,093
How many airports in Ontario and Quebec?

919
01:53:29,178 --> 01:53:31,179
You want me to stop calling and count?

920
01:53:33,182 --> 01:53:36,100
- Long way to go with just a carry-on.
- I'm sorry?

921
01:53:36,185 --> 01:53:38,478
Long way to go with just a carry-on.

922
01:53:40,105 --> 01:53:43,483
You know how many times
you guys have lost our bags?

923
01:53:44,401 --> 01:53:47,195
Here's your tickets and boarding passes.

924
01:53:48,197 --> 01:53:49,447
Thank you.

925
01:53:52,576 --> 01:53:53,784
They found the parents.

926
01:54:18,185 --> 01:54:21,687
You decided to go for a drive
for the entire day?

927
01:54:22,064 --> 01:54:24,398
George wanted to see the leaves.

928
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:42,792
And you have absolutely no idea
where they're going, right?

929
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:45,002
I told you. We never spoke.

930
01:55:12,948 --> 01:55:13,990
Hey.

931
01:55:16,368 --> 01:55:17,868
I'll do this.

932
01:55:28,213 --> 01:55:29,589
Go ahead, Luke.

933
01:55:32,384 --> 01:55:33,384
Hello.

934
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:50,026
You look like you need to get away.

935
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:01,746
Thank you.

936
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:05,541
Come on, buddy.

937
01:56:35,947 --> 01:56:38,824
- Too bad you didn't find more of it.
- Yeah.

938
01:56:39,868 --> 01:56:42,203
And I wish I could figure out where this is.

939
01:56:42,954 --> 01:56:45,998
I checked Web sites for every
tourist destination I could think of.

940
01:56:47,334 --> 01:56:49,585
- That's the Presidential Palace.
- What?

941
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:53,005
It was all over CNN
when it collapsed during the earthquake.

942
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:58,302
We know where they're going!

943
01:56:58,387 --> 01:56:59,637
Show me.

944
01:57:00,722 --> 01:57:04,392
Thank you for waiting.
We'll soon begin boarding by rows.

945
01:57:07,938 --> 01:57:10,564
Hold them at the gate. Take a look.

946
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:13,234
Let's go!

947
01:57:34,631 --> 01:57:36,799
Excuse me, folks. No one else on.

948
01:57:37,426 --> 01:57:40,594
Excuse me, folks. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

949
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:01,574
Sorry. There's no one by that description
on this flight.

950
01:58:01,825 --> 01:58:03,451
No. They're on it.

951
01:58:03,535 --> 01:58:04,744
Do you have the photographs?

952
01:58:04,828 --> 01:58:07,204
We have the photographs.
They're not on this plane.

953
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:14,003
Are there any other flights to Haiti tonight?

954
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:18,340
No other flights. Anything else?

955
01:58:24,473 --> 01:58:27,141
No. No. Thank you.

956
01:58:30,979 --> 01:58:32,396
It's starting to rain.

957
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:38,944
I'll call the FBI.

958
01:58:45,494 --> 01:58:49,705
You ever ask yourself
why we found this bag and not the others?

959
01:58:58,799 --> 01:59:01,091
The captain has switched off
the seat belt light.

960
01:59:01,176 --> 01:59:06,055
Flight time to Caracas, Venezuela,
this evening is five hours and 32 minutes.

961
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:10,684
While in your seat, the captain asks
that you keep your seat belt fastened.

962
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:18,484
This guy's a teacher?

963
01:59:19,069 --> 01:59:21,028
At a community college.

964
02:01:01,004 --> 02:01:02,254
Hey!

965
02:03:06,379 --> 02:03:09,048
- She heard a button pop.
- What?

966
02:03:15,263 --> 02:03:17,181
She heard a button pop.

967
02:03:24,814 --> 02:03:27,399
Was it raining when we searched the scene?

968
02:03:27,484 --> 02:03:28,901
Three years ago?

969
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:31,070
What are we doing here?

970
02:03:57,222 --> 02:04:00,099
Why don't you act like a cop?
Grab the other side.

971
02:04:00,183 --> 02:04:01,433
You're out of your mind.

972
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:05,479
- Ready?
- Yeah.

973
02:04:09,275 --> 02:04:10,317
You got it?

974
02:04:25,625 --> 02:04:27,584
You really thought you were gonna find it?
