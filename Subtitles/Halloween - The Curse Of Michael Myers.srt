Oh, God, it's coming!

4
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,750
Oh, God, it's coming!

5
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,460
No!

6
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Please, give him to me.

7
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,510
Please.

8
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,600
No. Please, my baby.
Please, give him to me.

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,730
Damn you!

10
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,610
When Michael Myers was six years old,

11
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,160
he stabbed his sister to death.

12
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:32,540
For years he was locked up,
locked away in Smith's Grove Sanitarium.

13
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,590
But he escaped.

14
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,470
And suddenly...

15
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,680
Halloween was another word for mayhem.

16
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,100
He needed to wipe out his entire family.

17
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,110
He struck them down at night,
and always on Halloween.

18
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,200
The police tried
everything to stop him.

19
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:12,430
He overcame them all
and disappeared.

20
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,760
The world thought him dead,

21
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,300
But I... I wasn't sure.

22
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,720
I wasn't sure that
Michael Myers had died.

23
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,070
Jamie, come to me.

24
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,960
Jamie, come to me.

25
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,110
Jamie...

26
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,610
Come with me if you
want to save your baby.

27
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,700
- Oh, God... He's coming.
- We've got to move, now.

28
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Come on.

29
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,630
No! Oh, God.

30
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Come on.

31
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,980
It's okay!

32
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,780
You can do it.
You can do it.

33
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,030
There!

34
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:12,990
It's that way!

35
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,500
Go, now. Save your baby! Go now!

36
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
Jamie?

37
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,820
Jamie?

38
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,120
Hey!

39
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,420
What are you doing in my truck?

40
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,580
Run!

41
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
What the hell're you doing in my truck?

42
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,730
What?

43
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,630
Run!

44
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,140
What?

45
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,820
Danny. Danny.

46
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,770
- Kill for him.
- Mommy!

47
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,650
Danny?

48
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,990
Mommy's here.

49
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,910
What is it, baby?

50
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,410
The Voiceman. He's here.

51
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,450
- No one's there, sweetheart.
- But I've seen him.

52
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,040
You've been watching way
too much TV, you know that?

53
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,580
He says things. Bad things.

54
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,960
Like what?

55
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Okay.

56
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,930
Stay away monsters,
stay away ghouls.

57
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,640
Stay away from Danny,
you jerks know the rules.

58
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,450
Better? Here.

59
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,670
Good night, Danny.

60
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Good night, mom.

61
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,470

63

<i>We're in the second hour of a special Halloween</i>

<i>I... I know this may sound crazy, Barry, but...</i>

73
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,630
<i>I really think I'm in love with him.</i>

74
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,170
<i>He's so untamed, so uninhibited.</i>

75
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,840
<i>He's everything I've ever wanted in a man.</i>

<i>You know, this is good.</i>

<i>What about that Dahmer guy? I bet...</i>

81

<i>- No, I just want Michael.</i>

<i>I... I wanna know what's behind that mask.</i>

83

<i>Deep down, I think he's</i>
<i>just like you and me, Barry.</i>

84
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,790
He just needs someone

<i>- Someone to love him.</i>
<i>- Yeah, deep down I'm sure that's true.</i>

<i>- My name's Tommy.</i>

93
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,870
I was only eight years old, when I saw him.

94
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,170
But I was one of the lucky ones.

95
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,170
I survived.

96

<i>Come on. You don't really believe</i>
<i>that Michael Myers is actually alive.</i>

99
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,100
Michael's work isn't done in Haddonfield.

100

And soon...

101
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,270
Very soon...

102
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,100
He'll come home...

103
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,770
To kill again.

104
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,610

115
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,810
<i>Barry, you're too much.</i>

116
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,390
<i>I'd just like to say that I</i>
<i>understand how things</i>

117
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,020
<i>have changed in the 90's.</i>

118

<i>Gays in the military,</i>

<i>and become a national hero.</i>

120
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,800

121
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,530
<i>Wink, wink. Thank you, Dwayne.</i>
<i>You may leave me now.</i>

122
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
<i>Next caller.</i>

123
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,200
<i>I say it's about time they had</i>
<i>a Halloween revival in this town.</i>

124
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,080
<i>Now my kids can</i>
<i>stop driving me crazy.</i>

125
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,880
<i>That maniac's either</i>
<i>long dead or long gone.</i>

126
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,000
<i>Either way, I say let's bury this</i>
<i>sucker and get the party started.</i>

127
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,670
<i>Party, woo-hoo!</i>
<i>Beer! Yeah!</i>

128
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
<i>Thank you, Ashley.</i>

129
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,180
Barry, what happened to that
psychiatrist of his, Loomis?

130
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,680
I heard the old quack was dead.

131
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:15,850
Not dead. Just very much retired.

132
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,160
- Good God. Terence. Come in.
- Christ, what a night.

133
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,700
Not even so much as a sign
for five miles on that road!

134
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,080
That's the beauty of the countryside.

135
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,460
I thrive on it.

136
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,840
- God, you look good, Sam.
- I feel great.

137
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,210
I had surgery, plastic surgery.

138
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:50,140
Skin grafts. It cost a fortune, but at
least I don't frighten people anymore.

139
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,560
Don't tell me the revered
Rasputin of Smith's Grove

140
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,850
has grown complacent
in his old age.

141
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,850
Well, I won't believe
that for a second.

142
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,690
Well, I can't remember you
making house calls, Dr. Wynn,

143
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,690
especially at this hour.

144
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,410
And you're right.
I've come to celebrate?

145
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,580
Why are you listening to that jerk?

146
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,870
Oh, it's a program about Haddonfield.

147
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,870
I'm taping it.

148
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,150
<i>So, who is responsible for getting</i>
<i>this Halloween rally thing together?</i>

149
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,150
<i>We are, the students of</i>
<i>Haddonfield junior college.</i>

150
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,450
<i>But why go to all the trouble</i>
<i>of throwing this soiree?</i>

151
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,840
<i>So what if Halloween has</i>
<i>been banned in Haddonfield?</i>

152
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,870
<i>Who gives a damn?</i>

153
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,370
<i>We do! We live here.</i>
<i>I mean, it's time we got on with our lives.</i>

154
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,870
<i>That's what tomorrow night is all about.</i>

155
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,040
<i>- This town is dying, Barry.</i>
<i>- Wow.</i>

156
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,420
<i>You know, I've heard Michael Myers blamed</i>
<i>for a lot of things tonight, but this is a first.</i>

157
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,960
<i>He's actually killed the economy!</i>

158
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,550
<i>Look, tomorrow night is</i>
<i>going to change all that,</i>

159
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,430
<i>especially after you do your</i>
<i>broadcast live from campus.</i>

160
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,760
<i>You have reached Haddonfield</i>
<i>Emergency Services.</i>

161
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,640
<i>Due to severe weather conditions,</i>
<i>all circuits are momentarily busy.</i>

162
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,560
<i>If this is not an emergency...</i>

163
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,480
<i>You gonna get up there on the stage with old Bar'?</i>

164
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,150
<i>- Uh, yeah, I will.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

165
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,570
<i>Well, I'll see you tomorrow night.</i>
<i>This is "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.</i>

166
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:37,040
<i>Give me a call at 1-800-968-7825.</i>
<i>That's 1-800-YOU-SUCK.</i>

167
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,210
<i>So come on, all you</i>
<i>boogeyman believers out there.</i>

168
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,750
<i>Give me a call.</i>

169
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,330
<i>Call me tonight.</i>

170
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,210
Well, after 32 years,

171
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,630
guess who is finally
relinquishing his duties

172
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,970
as chief administrator
of Smith's Grove?

173
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,390
- Good god, you don't mean to say you're—
- Retiring!

174
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,770
I came by to give you
the news myself.

175
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,600
Well, I wish you well, Terence.

176
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,270
It's been in the planning
stages for some time now.

177
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,690
To old friends...

178
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,570
To retirement...

179
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,450
To new beginnings.

180
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,070
Old friends.

181
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,790
Sam...

182
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,460
I want you to come back to Smith's Grove.

183
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:34,090
You should know that it's not wise
to play Halloween pranks on me.

184
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,890
It's no prank. You are the one I've chosen, Sam.
I want you to come back.

185
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,270
After my stroke six years ago they
practically had to hold a pistol

186
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,980
to my head to get me to retire, but...

187
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,690
Things are different now.
I'm different.

188
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,860
I've buried the ghosts.
I've buried them in this manuscript.

189
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,490
I don't want to practice medicine anymore.

190
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,000
<i>- They're coming! They're coming!</i>
<i>- Yeah. So they're coming, they're coming.</i>

191
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,120
<i>Don't tell me, your name is Joan...</i>

192
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,830
<i>Joan of Arc, and you're also</i>
<i>hearing voices, right?</i>

193
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
<i>Now, who's coming?</i>

194
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,590
<i>It's Michael.</i>

195
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,470
<i>Michael Myers.</i>

196
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,340
<i>Look, someone, anyone...</i>

197
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,220
<i>Help me. Dr. Loomis, are you out there?</i>

198
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,270
<i>- Can you hear me? Dr. Loomis, I need your help.</i>
<i>- Please, please. No, no, stop. Stop that.</i>

199
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,690
<i>What the hell is going on tonight?</i>

200
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,150
<i>Every looney in the state is calling.</i>
<i>What is this? A full moon?</i>

201
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,780
<i>Oh, man. I guess Halloween</i>
<i>brings out all the wackos.</i>

202
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,780
<i>I can't wait until we get</i>
<i>to Haddonfield tomorrow.</i>

203
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,660
Shhh. Shhhh.

204
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,480
It's okay.

205
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,290
Yes. It's alright.

206
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,490
Shhh. Yes.

207
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,990
It's okay.

208
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,370
No!

209
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,340
Leave us alone!

210
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,540
You can't have the baby, Michael.

211
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,250
You can't have the baby.

212
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,330
Enough...

213
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,160
of this Michael Myers...

214
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,370
bullshit!

215
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,130
Now, you stinking kids got about three
seconds to get the hell off my property!

216
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,140
One!
Two!

217
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,970
It was Jamie Lloyd.

218
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,050
That was six years ago, Sam.

219
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,390
You know she died with
him in that explosion.

220
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,080
- You know it!
- That's what someone would like us to believe.

221
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:47,360
But I tell you Michael is alive.
I can feel his evil heart beating,

222
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,570
I can see him just as I
did all those years ago

223
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,740
behind these very same walls.

224
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:01,960
Staring, staring.
Always growing stronger.

225
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:12,630
Please. As my colleague, as my
friend, I can't go through this again.

226
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,640
Not alone.

227
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,890
I need your help
to stop him.

228
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,400
Dr. Wynn, I didn't
expect you in this morning.

229
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,780
Donna, this is Dr. Loomis,
the man I was telling you about.

230
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,530
Oh, yes. It's a pleasure
to meet you, doctor.

231
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,900
It will be wonderful to
have you back at the hospital.

232
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,870
Dr. Wynn, there's
something you should know.

233
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,330
Donna, I'd like you to get
Dr. Loomis anything he needs.

234
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,920
Files, tests, records of every
treatment we've ever administered

235
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,250
to a former patient of
ours, Michael Myers.

236
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,430
- Michael Myers?
- Is something wrong?

237
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,600
I just received a phone call.
That girl Jamie Lloyd...

238
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,010
Her body was found this
morning near Haddonfield.

239
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,710
Notify the Haddonfield sheriff;
tell him we're on the way.

240
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,480
I want the entire staff on alert.

241
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,150
We go to code red lockdown
for twenty-four hours.

242
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,360
If that maniac
is really out there...

243
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,360
I plan to bring him back.

244
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,770
Alive.

245
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,240
Yo, G, wassup?!

246
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,620
Barry's my
homeboy from Chicago.

247
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,120
Yes, that Barry Simms.

248
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,500
Beth and I are
down on this gig.

249
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,910
Danny.

250
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,300
Look, you just bring the posse
tonight, and we'll hook you up.

251
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,510
Ace.

252
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,180
Doesn't Danny look cute
dressed up as his Uncle Tim?

253
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,560
Great. Now I've got a six-year-old
gang member for a son.

254
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,810
Perfect.

255
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,230
This is the famous Tim
Strode stomach pounder.

256
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,900
- You down for the challenge?
- Hit me, G.

257
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,240
Good try, Dan man.

258
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,200
You better stick to orange juice.

259
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,040
Shitheads.

260
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,040
Defacing my property.

261
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,250
- I showed them.
- John, they were just kids.

262
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,920
Kids, my dear Deborah, are
what's ruining this country.

263
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,760
Everywhere you go it's the same damn thing.
There's no goddamn respect.

264
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,550
I rest my case.

265
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,560
Kara, you'll never pass that
exam on an empty stomach.

266
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,900
"Cognitive therapy and emotional disorders".
What are they teaching you in college these days?

267
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,150
The art of going crazy?

268
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,070
It's called psychology, mom.

269
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,200
Living in this house is
enough to drive anyone crazy.

270
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,340
Oh, yeah?

271
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,200
Well, who the hell asked you to
come back here in the first place?

272
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,710
I better get Danny to school.

273
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,340
Doesn't show her face around
her own family for five years...

274
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,000
then comes back and expects
us to roll out the red carpet.

275
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,130
You think going to college is gonna
make up for your mistakes, girl?

276
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,550
- John, please.
- Lay off her, dad.

277
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,010
Let's go, Danny.

278
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,220
Kara, wait, please. John, can't we just
sit down for once and try to be a family?

279
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,560
Sorry, Mom.

280
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,650
Oh, yeah, that's it, Deborah.
Just keep slipping her the cash.

281
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,150
You know, while you're at it,
I got a great idea. Here.

282
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,440
Why don't you give her
all of our goddamn money?

283
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,360
Why don't you leave her alone?

284
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,360
Nothing ever changes, does it?

285
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,990
You've gotta wake up.

286
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,780
I got news for you, girl.

287
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,000
Before you came around,
everything was going fine.

288
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,750
Until you landed on our doorstep.

289
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,670
You and that little...

290
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,040
bastard of yours.

291
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,550
I see only one bastard in this house.

292
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,770
Danny...

293
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,650
Get away from her!

294
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,360
- You shut up and stay outta this!

295
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,440
- John, please, don't!
- Kill for him.

296
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,200
You ever talk to me like that again
and so help me God...

297
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,160
You understand?

298
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,970
Give me the knife, Danny.

299
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,110
Hey...

300
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,530
Hey. Make way for the Hardin County Express.
Where's Tim?

301
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,020
We're supposed to go over
the list of events for tonight.

302
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:48,330
Oh, God.
Did he do that to you?

303
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,040
Another episode of "Father
Knows Best" at the Strode house.

304
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,460
What the hell happened this time?

305
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,210
- What's gotten into you?
- Just glad to see you, that's all.

306
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,460
You guys okay?

307
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,720
Tonight's the night we bring
some life back into this town.

308
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,350
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be
the ones to organize this friggin' fair?

309
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,760
I mean, it's only Halloween.

310
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,600
How many times do I have to tell you.
It's not about Halloween.

311
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,810
Now, Danny, you know Grandpa
didn't really hurt me, right?

312
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,020
Right, Mom.

313
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,320
Well, you'd better
go catch your bus.

314
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,360
But tonight when you come home
we'll go trick-or-treating, okay?

315
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,240
Okay.

316
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,660
- I love you, Danny.
- I love you, Mommy.

317
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,450
Give me a squeeze.

318
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,840
Yeah. Okay.

319
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,760
I just can't live with her
anymore, Deborah.

320
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,720
You don't understand, do you?

321
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,680
It's not about Kara,
it's about you.

322
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,730
I don't care what she's done;
she's your daughter.

323
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,030
She's not my daughter anymore.

324
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,360
Beth, who's that guy who
lives across the hall from you?

325
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,200
Why, you interested?

326
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,530
Yeah, right.

327
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,870
He's always staring out his window.

328
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,500
Last night, I caught him watching me.

329
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,830
That must be Tommy.

330
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,830
On a weirdness scale of one to ten,

331
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,750
he rates about a 13.

332
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,340
Supposedly some scary shit happened
to him, when he was a kid.

333
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,010
Messed up his head pretty bad.

334
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,420
He's harmless, though.

335
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,720
- He's probably just lonely.
- Or horny.

336
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,850
Something you probably haven't felt in a while.

337
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Tim...

338
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,680
Happy Halloween, Mrs. Blankenship!

339
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:41,190
Best part about living in that boarding house is
that crazy old lady wouldn't hear a truck

340
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,600
drive through her living room.

341
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,980
Please. Look, you've gotta listen to me!
They're coming! They're coming!

342
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,780
Yeah, so they're coming, they're coming.
Don't tell me. Your name is Joan...

343
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,570
Joan of Arc and you're also hearing voices, right?

344
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,700
Come on. Now, who's coming?

345
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,330
It's Michael.

346
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,960
Michael Myers.

347
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,420
Look, someone, anyone, help me.

348
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,340
Dr. Loomis, are you out there?
Can you hear me, Dr. L...

349
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,430
It's Michael.
Michael Myers.

350
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,520
...your attention, please.
Bus 611 from Pontiac...

351
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,640
Look, someone, anyone, help me.
Dr. Loomis, are you out there?

352
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,690
Can you hear me, Dr. Loomis? I need your help.

353
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,020
- God, please, help.
- May I have your attention, please?

354
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:29,150
Bus 34 from Peoria, Russelville and Gardner...

355
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,660
with through service to Chicago, Illinois...

356
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,200
will be arriving in five minutes.

357
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:39,330
Ticketed passengers, please wait inside
the door until arrival of bus number 34.

358
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,960
Can I help you, sir?

359
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,340
Can you tell me if a bus arrived
from Pontiac last night?

360
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,390
Sure did.

361
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,060
- Are you looking for someone?
- Thank you.

362
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,890
May I have your attention, please?

363
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,600
Bus number 34,
service to Chicago,

364
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,270
has arrived and is now ready for
boarding through the side doors.

365
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,850
Jesus.

366
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,970
Shhh. Shhh.

367
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,030
No. It's okay.

368
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,570
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, man.

369
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,740
It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

370
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,760
Good God, what's that?

371
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,220
It's... his mark.

372
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,720
He's come home.

373
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,190
Dear God.

374
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,270
Jamie.

375
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,280
Only God can help her now, sir.

376
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,320
Sam, don't.
Let them take care of her.

377
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,660
- Doctor Loomis.
- Yeah.

378
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,620
They told me you'd be coming.

379
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,370
Now I suggest you go right on
back to your crackpot asylum.

380
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,170
You people got no
business in my town.

381
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,630
Michael Myers is my business.

382
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,260
It's been quiet here for six years
and that's the way it's gonna stay,

383
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,050
and the last thing I need now is you
going around spouting off ghost stories.

384
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,470
I suppose it was a ghost
that did all this, then.

385
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,310
It was a ghost talking
on the radio last night.

386
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,770
That's a ghost being
carried out of here right now?!

387
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,760
Yo, check it out!

388
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,260
Tonight's gonna be killer.

389
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,510
Kara, I swear. One of these days,
you're gonna get lost in that thing.

390
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,640
- I can't find my term paper.
- So copy someone else's. I do it all the time.

391
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,060
Works primo.

392
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,480
Oh, shit!

393
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,360
Looks like your little boy has got
himself quite an imagination.

394
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,070
He's been having nightmares.

395
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,200
I think it's cool.

396
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,540
- Must be some nightmares.
- Beth, we got work to do.

397
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,290
Hey...

398
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,960
Are you gonna be okay?

399
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,010
"Thorn"?

400
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,850
I need to see a doctor.

401
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,480
- What seems to be the problem?
- Uh, it's my baby.

402
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,940
There's been an accident.

403
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,400
- What kind of accident?
- Get me a doctor! Now!

404
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,370
Security?

405
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,240
Sam, there's nothing you
can do for her now.

406
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,170
Dr. Loomis?

407
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,710
Yeah.

408
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,170
Dr. Loomis...

409
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,340
Thank God you're here.

410
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,300
You heard her last night, didn't you?
It was Jamie.

411
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,390
I'm sorry.

412
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,770
- I don't know you, do I?
- I'm Tommy.

413
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,480
Tommy Doyle.

414
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:38,360
Laurie Strode, Jamie's mother, was
baby-sitting me the night when...

415
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,820
Tommy Doyle.

416
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,570
What're you doing here?

417
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,200
Please...

418
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,280
I need to know the truth.

419
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,740
Michael Myers has come
home, hasn't he?

420
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,250
What do you know
about Michael?

421
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,670
I know he's still out there.

422
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,070
People in this town,
they want us to believe he's dead,

423
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,960
but I know.
I've always known.

424
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,090
She's out there fighting for her life.
If she should die...

425
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:10,350
- She is the last of his bloodline.
- No, Dr. Loomis.

426
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,560
She's not the last.

427
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,770
Oh, God.

428
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,850
There's a family. Relatives of
the people who adopted Laurie:

429
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,190
the Strodes.

430
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,570
They're living in the Myers house.

431
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,690
Dr. Loomis, about Michael...

432
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,950
- It's just a theory of mine of...
- That's him.

433
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,580
Meet me tonight.
9:00 at the campus rally.

434
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,870
Tommy, wait!

435
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,040
Wait!

436
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,750
Tommy, wait!

437
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,250
Oh, there you are.

438
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,790
Who is that boy?

439
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,260
An old friend.

440
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,920
Great.

441
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,980
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Strode.

442
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,150
Is everything all right?

443
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,650
Who are you?

444
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,490
I came to help your family.

445
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,020
Shh. Shh.

446
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,640
It's okay.

447
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,930
Okay.

448
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,270
Steven.

449
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,610
You like that name?

450
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,520
Yeah, I think it suits you.

451
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,500
It's okay. It's alright.

452
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,000
I won't let anything happen to you.

453
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:21,390
For 15 years I've been obsessed to find
out what was going on inside of him.

454
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:26,680
It's been my life's work,
and my ultimate failure.

455
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:33,190
This force, this thing that lived inside
of him came from a source too violent,

456
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,110
too deadly for you to imagine. It...

457
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,030
It grew inside him.

458
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,830
Contaminating his soul.

459
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,290
It was...

460
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,580
pure evil.

461
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,670
- What makes you think he'll come back here?
- This house...

462
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,960
is sacred to him.
He has all his memories here.

463
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,710
His rage!

464
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,760
Mrs. Strode...

465
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:00,940
I beg of you.

466
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,520
Don't let your family suffer the same
fate that Laurie and her daughter suffered.

467
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,270
- Jamie? I... I thought that she—
- She's been found.

468
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,570
Outside Haddonfield, stabbed.

469
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,870
What should I do?

470
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:29,160
I really am sorry, but you haven't
a moment to lose, Mrs. Strode.

471
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,920
Michael Myers has come
back to Haddonfield to kill.

472
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,420
Strode Real Estate.

473
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,890
John, something terrible's happened.

474
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,720
What do you want now, Deborah?

475
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,730
A man came by the house,
a psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.

476
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,270
And he told me about the terrible things
that happened here in our house.

477
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,590
Deborah, what the hell are you doing?
Talking to strangers, letting 'em in our house?

478
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,780
John, they found Jamie Lloyd this morning.
Someone tried to kill her.

479
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:02,080
Deborah, I don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

480
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,910
You ought to stop watching
those damn TV talkshows.

481
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,780
I'm getting the children out of here.

482
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,080
At least until I know what's going on.

483
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,880
John, I want you to come with us.

484
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,000
You know. You know, Deborah.

485
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,510
You've lost it. You know that, Deborah?
You've just lost it.

486
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,010
The reason you moved us into this house...

487
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,850
Your brother could never sell it
because of what happened here, could he?

488
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,510
And you knew.

489
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,390
And you didn't tell us, John.

490
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,390
You knew.

491
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,110
Goddamnit!

492
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,390
Happy Halloween, little girl.

493
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,000
Hello?

494
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,890
We want the child.

495
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,520
Who is this?

496
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,720
Oh, Michael.

497
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,580
<i>I'm coming.</i>

498
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,020
Yeah, I'm...

499
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:48,570
<i>Get ready, oh, yes! Yeah. Yes.</i>

500
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,240
<i>I'm coming, all right, and you'd better</i>
<i>be there at the Halloween Harvest fair.</i>

501
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,660
<i>Let's do it, together.</i>

502
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,050
Sorry.

503
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,720
Mom? I'm home!

504
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,730
Hello?

505
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,560
Mom!

506
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:10,550
Mom?

507
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:32,150
Mom?

508
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,060
Danny?

509
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:57,930
Mom?

510
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:00,300
Are you there?

511
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,490
What are you doing here?

512
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:14,300
I'm your neighbor from across the street.

513
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:17,510
- Tommy Doyle.
- What are you doing with my son?

514
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,300
And... and where's my mother?

515
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:22,800
She wasn't here... when Danny came home.

516
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,470
Danny, go downstairs.

517
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,890
But Tommy's my new friend.
He knows all about dinosaurs.

518
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,110
You're in danger. Come with me.

519
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,790
Hi, Mrs. B!

520
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,520
You don't really expect us to stay here, do you?

521
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:11,100
I want you to watch your house.
You can see everything from that window.

522
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,480
Do you know how insane this is?

523
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,230
Who am I supposed to be looking for?

524
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:18,150
Him.

525
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,330
Yeah. It's okay.

526
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,580
It's okay, Steven.

527
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,510
Mommy!

528
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,260
Mom!

529
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:43,720
Not now, Danny.

530
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,150
Here you go.

531
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,860
Come on.

532
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,160
What?

533
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,210
Here. Let me try.

534
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,250
There.

535
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,880
There.

536
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:26,550
See?

537
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:30,010
All it takes is a mother's touch.

538
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:40,420
Uncle Michael, please don't hurt me.
Oh, God, please forget me.

539
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,560
Your work is done now, Jamie.

540
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:11,320
I let you down again, Jamie.

541
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,790
I never should have left you.

542
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:22,420
Runes were a kind of... early alphabet...

543
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:26,170
that originated in Northern Europe about 500 B.C.

544
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:32,220
They were symbols carved out
of stone or pieces of wood,

545
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:36,310
used in pagan rituals to portend
future events and invoke magic.

546
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:42,980
Of all the runes, Thorn had
the most negative influence.

547
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:47,610
Among the ancient druids, Thorn
represented a demon that spread

548
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:53,070
sickness, destroyed crops, and brought
death to hundreds of thousands of people.

549
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,450
According to a Celtic legend,
one child from each tribe

550
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,660
was chosen to be inflicted with a curse of Thorn.

551
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:03,790
To offer the blood sacrifices of its
next of kin on the night of Samhain.

552
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,990
Halloween.

553
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:09,800
The sacrifice of one family meant
sparing the lives of an entire tribe.

554
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:13,930
So why are you so concerned
about us if Michael's only out

555
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,110
to kill his family?

556
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:18,180
In his mind, anyone living
in his house is his family.

557
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,440
For years I've been convinced
there must be some reason.

558
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,310
Some method behind Michael's madness.

559
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:28,030
And the common link I found is Thorn.

560
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,620
The druids were also great
mathematicians and astronomers.

561
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,580
The Thorn symbol is
actually constellation of stars

562
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,210
that appears from time to
time on Halloween night.

563
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,000
Whenever it appears, he appears.

564
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,340
I've traced it back to 1963,
when Michael murdered his sister, Judith.

565
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,890
The next time was in 1978; Michael
escapes from Smith's Grove.

566
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:57,810
It happened a decade later,
and the year after that. He kills again.

567
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,640
Now Jamie says Michael is back,
and for the first time in 6 years,

568
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,810
Thorn reappears.
Coincidence?

569
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:10,400
What would happen if he succeeded,
if he killed the last member of his family?

570
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,570
Well, Michael's power would end,

571
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:18,530
and the curse would be
passed on to another child.

572
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:24,920
I think that's why these people,

573
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,000
whoever they are,
are after Jamie's baby.

574
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,010
To make it Michael's final sacrifice.

575
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,640
Where are you going?

576
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,060
To find the only man who can
stop him before it's too late.

577
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:46,440
Oh, no. Where's Danny?

578
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,060
Danny?

579
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,180
Danny!

580
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,440
Mrs. Blankenship!

581
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,330
Have you seen...

582
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:57,610
Danny, don't ever walk off without
telling me where you're going!

583
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,160
Take him upstairs.

584
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,410
Lock the door and wait till I get back.

585
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,240
Kara...

586
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:04,710
Whatever you do...

587
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,130
Don't go back to your house.

588
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:16,380
You let him get to her!
How could you?

589
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:20,930
Dr. Loomis, during surgery we discovered
that Jamie's uterus was hemorrhaging,

590
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,930
and we found this.

591
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,940
It's placental fluid.

592
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:30,190
Good God in heaven, do you mean to say—

593
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,150
I estimate she gave birth
no more than 24 hours ago.

594
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:36,650
Then the question is:
Where is the baby?

595
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,030
I think I...
I may already know.

596
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,720
Do you know why we celebrate Halloween?

597
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:04,140
Because that's when we go
trick-or-treating and get candy.

598
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:05,520
Oh, well...

599
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,140
Yes, but...

600
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:10,230
A long, long time ago,

601
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:16,150
it was a night of great power,
when the days grew short

602
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,530
and the spirits of the dead

603
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:24,240
returned to their homes to
warm themselves by the fireside.

604
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:29,620
All across the land huge bonfires were lit.

605
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:33,290
Oh, there was a marvelous celebration.

606
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,800
People danced and they played games.

607
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,680
And they dressed up in costumes.

608
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,930
Hoping to ward off the evil spirits.

609
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:48,520
Especially the boogeyman.

610
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,940
What's the boogeyman?

611
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,690
Come on, Danny.
Say good night to Mrs. Blankenship.

612
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,110
- Good night, Mrs. Blankenship.
- He hears the voice, you know.

613
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,450
Just like the other boy that lived in that house.

614
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:05,700
What are you talking about?

615
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:08,080
I was baby-sitting with him that night.

616
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:11,210
Little Mikey Myers that lived across the street.

617
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:16,460
And that's when the voice came,
the night he murdered his sister.

618
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,300
Michael heard a voice?

619
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,430
It told him to kill his family.

620
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:36,650
- Where the hell's Barry? Let's go!
- Don't get star-struck on me now.

621
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:42,150
We got a real agenda here, and Barry
is gonna help us get the message out.

622
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:48,700
Hey, look...

623
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:59,940
Helloooo, Haddonfield!

624
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:07,890
- Barry!
- WKNB presents "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.

625
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,390
- live from Haddonfield, Illinois,
- Barry!

626
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,640
the home of Michael Myers!

627
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,150
Deborah!

628
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:25,450
I'm home!

629
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,530
Thanks for the dinner.

630
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,380
Come out, come out...

631
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:40,800
Wherever you are.

632
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:52,140
Goddamnit.

633
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,640
She actually left.

634
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,940
I know what's going on.

635
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:09,320
It must be the boogeyman.

636
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,410
Here I come, boogeyman.

637
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:14,290
'Cause, you know, I am really scared.

638
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:47,820
What the hell?

639
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:50,320
The power's off.

640
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,080
Tell me, kids, how's it feel to...

641
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:29,170
finally pull Halloween out of
the proverbial Haddonfield closet?

642
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,760
What we're saying here is...

643
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:35,100
we will no longer let the powers
that be control our minds.

644
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,470
For years...

645
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:40,230
Halloween has represented everything
that's wrong with Haddonfield.

646
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,810
But Michael Myers is long gone.

647
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:46,110
There is NO boogeyman!

648
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:47,310
Whoa!

649
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,690
Does she get this riled up in the sack, Tim?

650
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:54,610
I bet she wears crotchless
panties and barks like a dog.

651
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,820
Beth...

652
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,580
What do you say, honey?
You and me, uh...

653
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,500
As I was saying...

654
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,790
We have to stop acting out of fear.

655
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:07,290
Just look at Tim's family.

656
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,090
They live in the Myers house.

657
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:12,720
You do?

658
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,260
We do?

659
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,220
Uh... yeah, we do.

660
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:19,220
Great house.

661
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:23,310
- Strong wood.
- I see. You mean to tell me you actually live...

662
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,770
in the house...

663
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:27,810
of the most brutal
mass murderer in history?

664
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,610
This is the Barry Simms show.

665
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:34,530
And when we return...

666
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:36,780
we'll be coming at you live...

667
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:37,990
from the one...

668
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,120
the only...

669
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:41,910
Myers house.
How's that for a Halloween shock-fest?

670
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:45,490
How far to your house, kid?

671
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:47,670
About half a mile, but I don't know if my folks...

672
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,190
Good, I'll meet you
there in five.

673
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,720
What about the kids?
We're supposed to throw all the candy.

674
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:52,730
Phone!

675
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:54,260
Relax your crack, sweetheart.

676
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:57,390
Quick tootle around the old household
and we'll be right on back.

677
01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:02,220
Pull the van out back, so that I can
sneak out of here nice and quietly.

678
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:05,730
Oh, no. No, no, really, really.
You're too good to me. Really.

679
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,770
No. Thanks for putting me in the middle of this
cheap-shit country bumpkin outfit, Paul.

680
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:10,980
I really appreciate it!

681
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:12,980
My fans expect better than this.

682
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:16,860
No, no. Look, you tell that penny-pinching whiner
Mike Sarducci that when I get back,

683
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:20,330
I am personally gonna cut off his
balls and wear 'em as earrings.

684
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,450
Where's the goddamn van?
God!

685
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:27,370
Oh, no, I'm trotting out for a cheeseburger.
I'm taking the show to the real Myers house,

686
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:29,500
where we should have
done it in the first place.

687
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,180
Ten minutes in that house and I'll have
every fruitcake medium in the country

688
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:40,970
calling in trying to channel the
spirit of that pussy Michael Myers.

689
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,770
Sure, we can do another show about him.

690
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,810
Kick the audience in the face enough
and they'll lick you all over.

691
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,570
I'll call you when I get back, Paul. Bye-bye.

692
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,360
Where the f...

693
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:27,020
What happened to the lights?

694
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,520
Do you really think Barry's gonna show up?

695
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,900
Let's hope not.

696
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,900
I'm sorry he turned out
to be such an asshole.

697
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:38,240
It's okay.

698
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:40,700
Where is everyone?

699
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:41,910
Mom?

700
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,190
Kara?

701
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,830
They're probably at the fair,

702
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,750
which is where we should be.

703
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:47,950
Beth...

704
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:52,210
What you said before about
Michael Myers living in our house.

705
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,290
Is that really true?

706
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,380
It was a cold Halloween night.

707
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,720
He stood in the shadows,
watching through the windows...

708
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,260
as his sister and her boyfriend made love.

709
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,890
Then he crept inside...

710
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,810
picked up a huge butcher knife...

711
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,810
and made his way up these stairs.

712
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,810
He raised the knife up behind her...

713
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,940
She turned around...

714
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:18,360
and he stabbed her!

715
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,070
Cut it out, Beth!

716
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:26,620
I really didn't know that Michael
Myers lived in my house, okay?

717
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:28,450
It freaks me out.

718
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:30,950
I'm sorry.

719
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,710
I was just fooling around.

720
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,040
It's okay.

721
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:43,930
Let's get the candles.

722
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,010
Just a minute.

723
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:58,230
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

724
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:01,860
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

725
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:05,950
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

726
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:08,740
Mommy, it's raining red.

727
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:13,040
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

728
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:16,710
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

729
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:20,670
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

730
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,760
Mommy, it's raining red.

731
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:27,640
It's warm.

732
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:30,270
Why is it warm?

733
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:55,920
Dr. Loomis.

734
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,210
It's happening.

735
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:08,140
Your sister would kill us if she
knew we did it in her bed.

736
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,640
Hey, that was your idea.

737
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,430
I am bad, aren't I?

738
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:18,230
Only when you wear crotchless
panties and bark like a dog.

739
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:26,610
Where are you going?

740
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,160
I gotta take a shower.

741
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:30,990
You know, to stay fresh.

742
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:40,340
Watch out for the boogeyman.

743
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,740
Hey, Beth, can you bring a
towel in here? I'm freezing.

744
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:12,530
Where are you when I need you, honey?

745
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:21,540
Thanks.

746
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:23,840
I'll be in in a minute.

747
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,280
Mommy?

748
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:54,030
Hold on a second, Danny.

749
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:59,500
<i>Danny... Come to me...</i>

750
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:03,500
- Hello?
- Mom? Wait, who is this?

751
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:04,840
No, this is Beth.

752
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:06,880
What are you doing there?

753
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:09,880
- Do you know where my mother is?
- She's not home. No one is.

754
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:11,080
What's wrong?

755
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:12,510
Is Tim with you?

756
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:14,220
He's in the shower.

757
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:17,350
I'm across the street.

758
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,850
I can see you.

759
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,600
Beth, I want you to listen to me.

760
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:23,020
Get Tim and get out of that house.
Right now.

761
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:24,810
Carol, what the hell is going on?

762
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:28,230
Beth, look out! There's someone in the room.
He's right behind you!

763
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:46,380
No!

764
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,380
No!

765
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,140
Danny, no!

766
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,800
Danny!

767
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,310
Danny.

768
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:57,630
Danny?

769
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,140
Danny?

770
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,350
Danny.

771
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:12,900
Mommy?

772
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,440
It's okay.

773
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,610
Danny, run!

774
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,260
Danny.

775
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,220
Come to mommy.

776
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:12,100
Danny, please.

777
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:01,560
The baby.

778
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:02,690
Where's the baby?

779
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:03,790
Please!

780
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:05,240
Open the door!

781
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:06,590
Please!

782
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:09,410
Open the door!
Someone help us!

783
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:13,960
Please, somebody help us!

784
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:17,710
Help us, please!

785
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,880
Help us, please!

786
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,970
Get 'em upstairs!

787
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,130
Now!

788
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:30,220
Where's the baby?

789
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:31,600
He's gone.

790
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,060
Who else knew I had the baby?

791
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,520
- No one.
- No!

792
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:37,560
There had to be someone else...

793
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:41,400
- Who knew?
- Nobody knew except me and...

794
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,820
<i>Danny. Come to me.</i>

795
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:51,740
<i>Danny. Come to me.</i>

796
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:58,170
<i>Come Danny, come to me.</i>

797
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:07,420
Danny, no.

798
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,430
No.

799
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,640
Please.

800
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:17,310
Careful with the girl.

801
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:20,060
Kara!

802
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:22,270
Wynn.

803
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:31,740
Mrs. Blankenship!
Oh, God, hurry! We have to...

804
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:35,370
Hello, dear.

805
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,040
Where is she?

806
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,370
Where's Kara?

807
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:23,880
I feel like I've been drugged.

808
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:25,460
We have been drugged.

809
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:26,880
Why are they doing this?

810
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:29,300
Why didn't they just kill us?

811
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:31,880
It's his game.

812
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,220
And I know where he wants to play it.

813
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:07,380
- Dr. Loomis, you know that can't stop Michael.
- Nothing will stop Michael.

814
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:09,340
But...

815
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:10,760
Wynn.

816
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:14,840
I tried to tell you
in the hospital.

817
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:19,470
I think Michael is under the
influence of an evil rune.

818
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:21,550
Thorn.

819
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:28,650
I saw the symbol marked up
where we found Jamie stabbed.

820
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:31,530
Well, there are runes of light... Protection.

821
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:36,660
If Thorn could somehow be trapped by these
runes the energies could cancel themselves out.

822
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,580
The evil could be destroyed.

823
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,160
You wait here.

824
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:44,500
Don't go anywhere until I come back.

825
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,920
Wynn.

826
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,180
About time, Dr. Loomis.

827
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:02,390
Welcome to your fate.

828
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:05,310
The time has come for
you to know the truth.

829
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:09,940
The time has come
for you to join us.

830
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,040
Why now?

831
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,260
After Jamie escaped last night,
I knew that she would come to you,

832
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,330
and I knew that you would
lead us to her baby.

833
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:23,660
Her very special baby.

834
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:28,830
I needed her, just as I need you now.

835
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:33,880
It's your destiny, Sam.
It lives inside you.

836
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:36,840
It always has.
You know that, don't you?

837
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:38,130
You...

838
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:41,260
are...

839
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:43,770
a madman.

840
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:34,320
<i>Look around you, Sam.</i>

841
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,570
Madness everywhere.

842
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:41,870
Famine, war, a great plague.

843
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:48,410
These are signs that we must restore
balance to the natural order of things.

844
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,920
- We merely provide the means.
- Michael?

845
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:58,050
We've given him the power.
The gift of Thorn.

846
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:03,760
I am its deliverer. I follow it,
act as its guardian.

847
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,390
I protect Michael, watch over him.

848
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:12,520
And now it's time for another.

849
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,650
Now it's time for you....

850
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,650
Dr. Loomis.

851
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:23,030
I thought Michael was a monster.

852
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:24,870
But you...

853
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:38,460
Leave him there.

854
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,130
It's his office now.

855
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:12,460
Spirits and powers of the flame.

856
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:17,540
Attend and witness this ritual.

857
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:22,420
Bear our gifts to Thorn.

858
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,810
Open us to the path of darkness.

859
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:34,900
By these runes transform us.

860
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:42,110
Let the hammer descend on the chosen
one to whom we offer this sacrifice

861
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,110
of innocent blood.

862
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:54,460
And then, Danny,
your journey begins.

863
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,000
Kill for him.

864
01:26:58,590 --> 01:26:59,590
No.

865
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:05,010
Michael, your final sacrifice.

866
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:10,060
Michael, you can make him stop it.

867
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,020
Don't kill the baby.
You can stop it.

868
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,400
You know whose baby it is, don't you?

869
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:24,650
- Michael!
- The baby is yours, isn't it?

870
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:26,740
Isn't it, Michael?

871
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,160
Back off!

872
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:34,460
- Untie her.
- Do as he says. Do it!

873
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,420
You should join us, you have talent.

874
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:39,840
Shut up.

875
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,800
Danny, come on.

876
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:45,630
Go! Okay? Let's go.

877
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,100
Run!

878
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:02,980
Go!

879
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,690
Go, go!

880
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:29,720
Move it! Go, go!

881
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,600
Shit!

882
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:40,400
- Come on!
- It's not working.

883
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,730
Come on. It's not working!

884
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:45,230
It's not...

885
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:03,040
Back up from the gates!

886
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:10,050
Get 'em out of here!

887
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:16,010
Get in there!
Go on, get in!

888
01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:20,050
Mommy!

889
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:36,340
Samhain.

890
01:29:58,470 --> 01:30:00,350
Tommy! Where is he?

891
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,440
It worked.
The power of the runes stopped him.

892
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:07,980
Michael.

893
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:12,490
What have they done to you?

894
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:32,340
- Where do we go now?
- As far away from Haddonfield as possible.

895
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:38,720
- Come with us.
- No, I have a little business to attend to here.

896
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:12,840
Michael.

897
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:21,310
Michael.

898
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:24,640
It's all over.

899
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:26,650
It's all over!

900
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:31,820
It's all over now.

901
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:41,450
Michael.

902
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,040
Michael's gone.

903
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:49,080
It's your game now, Dr. Loomis.

904
