1
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,300
Hey! Whoa! Yo!
False alarm! Hold it!

2
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,800
It's O.K.! I'm here.

3
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,800
Here we are!
It's all right.

4
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,700
Set it down
nice and easy, huh?

5
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,210
Yeah, sure,
at the impound.

6
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,500
Next time,
read the sign.

7
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,770
Hey, you don't
understand.

8
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:50,781
Look, I'm just here
to meet my wife's plane.

9
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,281
You got to let me
have this car.

10
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:53,781
Yeah, sure, tomorrow,
8:00 to 4:00.

11
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,281
You pay 40 bucks,
we give it back.

12
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:56,651
Don't write it up.
Don't write it up.

13
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:58,781
Come on, man. This is
my mother-in-law's car.

14
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:01,761
She's already mad at me
'cause I'm not a dentist.

15
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,831
Look, I'm a cop--
L.A.P.D.

16
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,791
Oh, I was in L.A. once.
Hated it.

17
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:07,791
Well, I can understand.

18
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,061
I don't like it
much myself--Hey!

19
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:11,692
That's a plastic fender up there!
Take it easy!

20
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:13,832
Cut me some slack,
will you?

21
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:15,402
Look, I used to be
a cop in New York City.

22
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:18,062
I only moved to L.A.
because my wife took a job there.

23
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,332
Come on.
What do you say?

24
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:20,412
Here we are--

25
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:22,742
Washington, D.C.,
the heart of democracy.

26
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:24,642
One hand
washes the other.

27
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,312
Come on, man.
It's Christmas.

28
00:01:26,422 --> 00:01:28,912
So ask Santa Claus
to give you another car.

29
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,422
Merry Christmas, pal.

30
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:33,923
It's all yours, Murray.

31
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,423
Son of a bitch.

32
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:16,835
Yeah, I know that,
Larry.

33
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:20,735
Snow flurries along
the northeastern seaboard...

34
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:22,865
Hi. Where are
the telephones?

35
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:23,945
Right over there.

36
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:25,405
Thank you very much.

37
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:27,415
Thank you. Leonard Adkins
is in a warmer clime

38
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,245
with a story that grows
hotter by the minute.

39
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:31,755
Security was tight today
at Escalan Airport

40
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:33,645
in the Republic
of Valverde

41
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,745
where government
authorities report

42
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,755
that deposed General
Ramon Esperanza

43
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:40,126
will be delivered
for immediate extradition

44
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,426
to the United States.

45
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:43,056
Only two years ago,
General Esperanza

46
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,756
led his country's army

47
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:47,396
in a campaign against
Communist insurgents,

48
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:50,266
a campaign fought with
American money and advisers.

49
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:52,276
Esperanza's fall from power
caused ripples

50
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:54,346
not only in his country's
recent election,

51
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:57,306
but closer to home,
as well,

52
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,776
when high-ranking
Pentagon officials were charged

53
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:02,647
with supplying him with weapons
despite the Congressional ban.

54
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:05,217
But mounting evidence
that Esperanza's forces

55
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,517
violated the neutrality
of neighboring countries

56
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:09,787
made Congress
withhold funds,

57
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:11,727
funds which Esperanza
is accused of replacing

58
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:13,457
by going into
the lucrative business

59
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,087
of cocaine smuggling.

60
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,927
Although Esperanza was removed
as Commander In Chief

61
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:20,507
earlier this year,

62
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:23,227
the agreement to extradite him
was only reached yesterday,

63
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:24,598
and Washington
insiders say

64
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,438
it was a phone call
that made it happen,

65
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:27,738
a phone call
from a--

66
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:34,748
All right, all right.

67
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:39,258
If I could find a phone,

68
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:41,258
I'd call you,
whoever you are.

69
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,720
Bye.

70
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,260
Excuse me.
Thank you.

71
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,240
Yeah, this is
Lieutenant McClane.

72
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,740
Somebody there
just beep me?

73
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,500
I'd like to think
I'm somebody.

74
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,201
Honey,
where are you?

75
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:33,241
Did you land yet?

76
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:35,251
It's the nineties,
remember?

77
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:38,371
Microchips, microwaves,
faxes, airphones.

78
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:41,251
Yeah, well, as far
as I'm concerned,

79
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:43,341
progress peaked
with frozen pizza.

80
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:45,251
Listen, um,
we're going to be

81
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:47,261
about half an hour
late landing, O.K.?

82
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:48,761
I just wanted
to let you know.

83
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:50,231
The kids O.K.?

84
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,262
Yeah, well, they're about
to lose their minds

85
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:54,132
from all the sugar
your parents are giving them.

86
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:56,262
Did Mom give you
a hard time

87
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:57,772
about borrowing
her new car?

88
00:04:57,872 --> 00:04:59,532
No. Not yet.

89
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:01,772
Listen, honey,
when you land,

90
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:04,212
can we just, like,
you know, rent a car,

91
00:05:04,312 --> 00:05:06,212
check into a hotel,

92
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:08,712
leave the kids
with your parents,

93
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:10,252
order some room service?

94
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,222
A bottle of champagne,
what do you say?

95
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:14,813
You're on, Lieutenant.

96
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:17,223
I'll see you in about
a half an hour, honey.

97
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:18,553
I love you. Bye.

98
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,923
Isn't technology
wonderful?

99
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,733
My husband
doesn't think so.

100
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,463
Well, I do.

101
00:05:30,573 --> 00:05:33,733
I used to carry around
those awful mace things.

102
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:35,243
Now...

103
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:41,184
I zap any bastard
that screws with me.

104
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:46,754
I tried it
on my little dog.

105
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:49,484
Poor thing
limped for a week.

106
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:51,254
Heh.

107
00:05:57,204 --> 00:05:58,324
Excuse me.

108
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:02,265
Well, you look really
familiar to me.

109
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,205
I get that a lot.
I've been on TV.

110
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:07,035
Yeah. Me, too.

111
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:32,736
Grab the tools,
will you?

112
00:06:32,836 --> 00:06:34,206
You got it.

113
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:35,736
This is Amy Nichole

114
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:37,736
reporting live
from Escalan Airport

115
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:39,636
where deposed general
Ramon Esperanza

116
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:42,236
has just arrived
under heavy guard.

117
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:45,147
Strangely, the deposed
dictator's mood seems jubilant.

118
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,747
He is smiling and waving
to the crowd

119
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:49,717
like a man
running for political office.

120
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:54,047
...thousands of political
prisoners in the past decade,

121
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:55,747
including
the new president,

122
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:57,987
and there's no doubt
that he still has

123
00:06:58,097 --> 00:07:01,257
some ardent supporters
both here and abroad.

124
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:04,127
Rumors abound on Capitol Hill
that there were other...

125
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:07,668
Yeah?

126
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:08,968
Sorry to
bother you, sir.

127
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:10,098
We're checking
our equipment.

128
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,268
Any problems with
the conduit line?

129
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:14,278
Gee, I don't know
anything about that.

130
00:07:14,378 --> 00:07:16,678
Would you mind
if we take a look?

131
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:18,178
Help yourself.

132
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:31,189
It just don't seem
right somehow--

133
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:32,699
closing down
this church.

134
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,699
The parish is going to
keep on using it,

135
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,199
but it won't
be the same.

136
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:38,209
Been here
a lot of years,

137
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:40,209
and I've been
right here with it.

138
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:41,939
Yeah, I kind of
feel like

139
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,309
a piece of me is dying
along with this church.

140
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,139
Well, you're right
about that.

141
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,150
...cocaine smuggling,

142
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,880
racketeering, and bribing
government officials.

143
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,590
He certainly
doesn't show it,

144
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,600
but no matter
how high his spirits,

145
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,100
they can't hide the fact

146
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,430
that America's
war on drugs

147
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,190
has finally taken
its first prisoner.

148
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
This is Buckwheat.
The clubhouse is open.

149
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:17,401
Here at Dulles, the quiet men
from the justice department

150
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:20,211
wait to handcuff the man
who has come to symbolize

151
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:22,721
the enemy in America's
fight against cocaine.

152
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:24,721
That battle may be
almost won,

153
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:26,721
but the war
is still in doubt.

154
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:29,221
Samantha Coleman, WNTW,
for Night-Time News.

155
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:30,721
Roger that,
Colonel. Out.

156
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:48,572
That was the colonel.

157
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:50,272
Everyone's in position.

158
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:51,742
How's the weather?

159
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:54,752
We got flurries all along
the Virginia coast.

160
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:57,683
New storm front coming in
from the northeast.

161
00:08:57,793 --> 00:08:58,783
Heh heh.

162
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,253
God loves
the infantry.

163
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:02,553
Amen.

164
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:05,063
Carry out
your assignments.

165
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:10,963
15:51. Mark.

166
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:12,693
Check.

167
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,133
Later.

168
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:15,573
Adios.

169
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:38,224
Hey, it's cold
out there, man!

170
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:40,234
I stomped my feet
for five minutes.

171
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:41,425
Yeah, yeah.

172
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:52,915
Two cappuccinos.
Make it fast.

173
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:14,766
Scotch straight up,
please.

174
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:16,096
Excuse me, Officers.

175
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:17,936
This may sound like
a wild-goose chase,

176
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:19,566
but I think
I just saw--

177
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,766
Saw what?

178
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:26,577
Elvis. Elvis Presley.

179
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:31,907
Fuckin' tourists.
Ought to be a law.

180
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:33,287
Excuse me. There's
a large number of you

181
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:34,817
from the justice department
here this evening.

182
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,787
Is there any particular
reason for that?

183
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:37,787
Just routine.

184
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:38,787
Just routine?

185
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:39,797
Yes.

186
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:40,797
Any comment, sir?

187
00:10:40,897 --> 00:10:41,887
Not now.

188
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:43,897
Thank you, sir.
Thanks.

189
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:51,568
Hey, that's
Colonel Stuart over there.

190
00:10:51,678 --> 00:10:53,798
Got a little problem
with personnel.

191
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:55,808
Last-minute replacement.

192
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:57,968
How's the security
around this place?

193
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,018
Like we figured--
a joke.

194
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,418
Colonel Stuart, could we have
a few words, please?

195
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:04,818
You can have two--
"fuck" and " you."

196
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:07,358
No pictures,
you pinko bitch.

197
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:10,689
Old news.

198
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,969
Oh!

199
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,129
Damn it!

200
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,140
Excuse me.

201
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,300
Hey, man.

202
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:55,301
What is it?

203
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:57,311
You got a key
for this door?

204
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:58,811
Yeah. Why?

205
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:01,711
Because I want you to
open it up, that's why.

206
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:06,251
Is there a cop on duty
around here?

207
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,581
The airport police.

208
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:08,981
Go get them.

209
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:35,212
Ha ha ha!

210
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:37,282
Hand me the wrench.

211
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,283
Going to work
overtime.

212
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,183
Good idea.

213
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:44,693
O.K., hold that end.

214
00:12:44,793 --> 00:12:46,783
Watch it, man.

215
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:50,293
All right.
Perfect. Perfect.

216
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,303
Good to go.

217
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:53,963
Hey!

218
00:12:55,203 --> 00:12:56,573
It's a restricted area.

219
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:58,433
What's the matter?

220
00:12:58,543 --> 00:12:59,973
Couldn't wait
for the skycap?

221
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:00,974
We work here.

222
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:03,044
Let's see some I.D.

223
00:13:03,144 --> 00:13:04,234
Ha ha.

224
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:06,334
Sure. No problem.

225
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:49,656
Oh,jeez. Fuck!

226
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,447
Hiyah!

227
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,098
What is this--
a tag team?

228
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:01,169
Aah!

229
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:02,399
Aah!

230
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:04,839
- Aah!
- Aah!

231
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:14,210
You say he came in here
and flashed a badge?

232
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,310
Yeah. He said to bring
you guys back here.

233
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,450
Uh! Ah!

234
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,260
Aah! Aah!

235
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,730
Aah! Aah!

236
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:37,701
Oh!

237
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:44,281
Christ.

238
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,222
Fucker!

239
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:06,262
Freeze!

240
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,742
Nice guess, asshole.
I'm a cop.

241
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:11,502
That was
the bad guy.

242
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:13,602
Where's your I.D.?

243
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,413
On its way
to Cleveland?

244
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,253
No, you did not
explain anything.

245
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:28,753
All you did was
shove me back here

246
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,263
into this
cattle car.

247
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:31,763
Sir, you were told
when you boarded

248
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:33,263
that we were
overbooked.

249
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:34,923
Fine. Done.
I accept that.

250
00:16:35,063 --> 00:16:37,263
But why can't I get
the first-class meal?

251
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:39,773
My network paid for it.
Do you know who I am?

252
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,203
Yes. We've all
seen your program.

253
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:42,774
Your episode
"Flying Junkyards"

254
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:45,344
was a very objective look
at air traffic safety.

255
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:46,814
It wasn't nearly
as edifying

256
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:49,474
as " Bimbos OfThe Sky,"
was it, Connie?

257
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,374
You think
you're funny.

258
00:16:51,484 --> 00:16:52,974
You think you're funny.

259
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:54,844
Fine.

260
00:16:54,954 --> 00:16:56,284
I've got
your number.

261
00:16:56,384 --> 00:16:57,824
And I've got yours.

262
00:16:57,924 --> 00:17:00,054
So park it, sir.

263
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:03,254
Fine.

264
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:14,035
Stewardess.

265
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:15,635
Mr. Thornberg,

266
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:17,475
you cannot
monopolize my time.

267
00:17:17,575 --> 00:17:19,345
You cannot put me
near that woman.

268
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:20,875
Excuse me?

269
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:23,745
He means he's filed
a restraining order

270
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:25,755
against me.

271
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:29,016
I'm not allowed
within 50 feet of him.

272
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:31,056
50 yards.

273
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:33,256
So by keeping me
in this section,

274
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:35,756
you are violating
a court order.

275
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:38,266
I can sue you
and this airline.

276
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:40,266
That woman assaulted me,

277
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:42,836
and she humiliated me
in public.

278
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:50,847
What did you do?

279
00:17:52,877 --> 00:17:55,437
Knocked out
two of his teeth.

280
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:58,547
Would you like
some champagne?

281
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:04,727
Sorry, Officer McClane.
I had to check.

282
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:07,227
Here's your piece
and shield back.

283
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:09,597
Thanks.

284
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,428
Over here, Officer!

285
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:13,198
We understand that
there was a shooting.

286
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:15,998
The presence ofJustice
Department officials...

287
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:17,508
Jesus!

288
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:19,508
Hey, come on.
Just a word, O.K.?

289
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:21,008
What the fuck
are you people--

290
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:22,508
What are you
doing here, man?

291
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:24,008
This is a crime scene.

292
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:25,978
You got to seal
this area off.

293
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:28,138
That's
up to the captain.

294
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:29,478
Maybe you better take me

295
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,748
up to the captain,
then, huh?

296
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:42,359
Where's Cochrane?

297
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,439
He didn't make it.

298
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,339
You're late.

299
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,350
We ran into trouble,
Colonel.

300
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,080
Some cop...
killed Cochrane.

301
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,450
I barely got away,
sir.

302
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,520
Did you accomplish
your mission?

303
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,020
Yes, sir, but...
Cochrane, sir.

304
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,030
Well, then
the damage is minimal.

305
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,030
The penalty
could be severe.

306
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:23,441
You fail me again,

307
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,031
and the chamber
won't be empty.

308
00:19:26,141 --> 00:19:27,871
Dismissed.

309
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:33,551
Miss. Miss.
I can't find my dog.

310
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:35,051
Miss. My dog.

311
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:36,551
One minute, ma'am.

312
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:38,621
I want you
to fill out this form.

313
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:47,862
Who is it?
Come in.

314
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:49,062
Captain Lorenzo?

315
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:50,072
Yeah.

316
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:51,072
I'm John McClane--

317
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:52,902
Yeah, yeah.
I know who you are.

318
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:55,562
You're the asshole
that just broke seven FAA

319
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:57,572
and five District
of Columbia regulations

320
00:19:57,682 --> 00:19:59,202
running around
my airport

321
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:01,042
with a gun,
shooting at people.

322
00:20:01,152 --> 00:20:02,843
What do you call
that shit?

323
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,213
Self-defense.

324
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:06,583
Well, what, you think
that L.A. badge

325
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:08,583
is going to get you

326
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:10,593
a free lunch or something
around here?

327
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:13,093
Well...maybe a little
professional courtesy.

328
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:15,423
Huh! In an airport
on Christmas week?

329
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:17,083
You've got to be
kidding.

330
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:18,593
O.K. Fuck courtesy.

331
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:20,103
How about just
being professional?

332
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:22,103
Your boys just walked away
from a crime scene, Captain.

333
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:24,104
You can't wrap this thing
up in 10 minutes.

334
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:25,604
You got to
seal the area off,

335
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:27,264
take pictures,
dust for prints.

336
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:29,504
Hey, don't
lecture me, hotshot.

337
00:20:29,614 --> 00:20:31,104
I know
what I'm doing.

338
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:32,614
We're going
to dust it down.

339
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:34,614
We'll take all the pictures.
We'll sweep for fibers.

340
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:36,114
When are you
going to do this?

341
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:37,614
After 300 or 400
people go through?

342
00:20:37,724 --> 00:20:39,114
You'd be lucky
to get a print

343
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:40,744
from one
of your own people.

344
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:41,754
Just shut down
that area and--

345
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:43,624
Oh,just
shut the area down.

346
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:46,455
It's that simple, huh?
Just shut the area down?

347
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:48,795
Yeah, and I got everybody

348
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:50,625
from the Shriners'
Convention

349
00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:53,135
to goddamn Boy Scouts
traipsing through here!

350
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,225
I got lost kids,
lost dogs--

351
00:20:55,335 --> 00:20:57,395
Not now! Later!

352
00:20:57,505 --> 00:20:58,635
I got international
diplomats.

353
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:01,645
I got a fuckin' reindeer
flying in here

354
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:03,575
from the fuckin'
petting zoo!

355
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:06,075
ButJohn McClane,
he's got a little problem.

356
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:08,546
Hell, let's shut down
the whole fuckin' airport!

357
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:10,246
What do you think
they're going to say upstairs

358
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:11,586
when I tell them that?

359
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:13,126
Pick up the phone
and find out.

360
00:21:13,226 --> 00:21:15,086
I don't need
fuckin' Forensics

361
00:21:15,196 --> 00:21:16,596
to tell me
all this was

362
00:21:16,696 --> 00:21:18,156
was some punk
stealing luggage!

363
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:20,326
Luggage? That punk
pulled a Glock 7 on me.

364
00:21:20,436 --> 00:21:21,656
You know what that is?

365
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:23,596
It's a porcelain gun
made in Germany.

366
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:25,636
It doesn't show up
on your airport X-ray machines

367
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,606
and costs more than
you make in a month.

368
00:21:27,706 --> 00:21:29,896
You'd be surprised
what I make in a month.

369
00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:31,907
If it's more than $1.98,
I'd be very surprised.

370
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,607
Hey, McClane,
don't start believing

371
00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:35,107
your own press, huh?

372
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:36,977
Yeah, yeah,
I know all about you

373
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:38,637
and that Nakatomi thing
in L.A.,

374
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:41,117
but just because the TV
thinks you're hot shit,

375
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,247
that don't make it so.

376
00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:45,417
Look, you are
in my little pond now,

377
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:48,787
and I am the big fish
that runs it.

378
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:51,657
So you capped
some lowlife.

379
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:52,758
Fine.

380
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:55,128
I'll send your
fuckin' captain in L.A.

381
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:56,638
a fuckin' commendation!

382
00:21:56,738 --> 00:21:58,758
In the meantime,
get the hell out of my office

383
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:01,638
before I have you
thrown out of my goddamn airport!

384
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:14,588
Hey, Carmine, let me
ask you something.

385
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:17,209
What sets off the metal
detectors first--

386
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:19,949
the lead in your ass or
the shit in your brains?

387
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:21,649
Fat fuck.

388
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:33,139
Any I.D. on this guy?

389
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:35,179
That's somebody else's
problem.

390
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,880
Your car's ready.
Sign right here.

391
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,880
I need to borrow
this and this.

392
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,110
I'll bring it
right back.

393
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,120
Hey! Yo!
Hold up!

394
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,690
Yo!

395
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,630
Hold up, boys.
Hold up. Hold up.

396
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,630
We got to check
something.

397
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,630
What are you doing?

398
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,631
Pretty gruesome
fuckin'job.

399
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:01,631
All the confusion
in there,

400
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:04,031
forgot to get
this clown's prints.

401
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:07,071
Ew! Christ.

402
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:09,571
Hey, you're supposed
to do that at the morgue.

403
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,241
Not anymore.

404
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:13,141
Got a new S.O.P.
for DOAs from the FAA.

405
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:18,581
Ha ha! I don't think
this one's going to make it, boys.

406
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:20,151
Thanks a lot.

407
00:23:55,223 --> 00:23:56,693
Ahh.

408
00:25:13,677 --> 00:25:15,197
Powell here.

409
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:16,537
Take that Twinkie
out of your mouth

410
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:17,807
and grab a pencil,
will ya?

411
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,577
Ha ha! Hey,John,
how are you doing?

412
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,277
Holly stood me up
a day,

413
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,147
and I'm here alone
in D.C.

414
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,777
with my in-laws.

415
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:27,787
Eh, the old in-laws, huh?

416
00:25:27,887 --> 00:25:30,657
They do love their
policemen son-in-laws.

417
00:25:30,757 --> 00:25:32,127
Listen, Al,

418
00:25:32,227 --> 00:25:34,457
what is the fax machine
telephone number

419
00:25:34,568 --> 00:25:36,118
there at the station?

420
00:25:36,228 --> 00:25:37,598
Uh...

421
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:41,098
555-3212.

422
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,798
3212. Hold on a second,
all right?

423
00:25:43,908 --> 00:25:46,308
I want to send you
something.

424
00:25:46,408 --> 00:25:47,338
Excuse me.

425
00:25:47,448 --> 00:25:49,808
You and faxes?
This is a first.

426
00:25:49,908 --> 00:25:51,308
Yeah, well,
Holly told me

427
00:25:51,418 --> 00:25:53,468
I should wake up
and smell the nineties.

428
00:25:53,578 --> 00:25:54,678
This way?

429
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:56,909
No. That way.

430
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:58,319
Wait.
It's upside down.

431
00:25:58,419 --> 00:25:59,819
It doesn't matter.

432
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,389
O.K. Here it comes.

433
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:04,929
I'm sending you
something right now.

434
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:07,329
Hold on a second,
cowboy.

435
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,110
Fingerprints?

436
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,550
We've got an unidentified
stiff here.

437
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,780
I've circled
the whirls in pen

438
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,440
in case the transmission's
a little fuzzy.

439
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,110
Listen, run it
through state and federal,

440
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,710
and if you can,
run it through Interpol.

441
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,150
Will do.
Well, what's this about?

442
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,690
Oh,just a feeling
I have.

443
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,950
Ouch. When you get
those feelings,

444
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,190
insurance companies
start to go bankrupt.

445
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,101
Listen, the, uh,
fax number is...

446
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,671
Is on the top edge
of the transmission...

447
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,531
Is on the top edge

448
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:48,871
of the transmission
you just got.

449
00:26:50,411 --> 00:26:52,001
Oh, an airport, huh?

450
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,171
Listen, you're not pissing
in somebody's pool, are you?

451
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,471
Ha ha. Yeah.

452
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,551
And I'm fresh
out of chlorine.

453
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:07,052
Just as this storm
starts breaking,

454
00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:10,092
the satellite will feed up
and drop the other shoe.

455
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:12,252
Look at this new front
moving in.

456
00:27:12,362 --> 00:27:14,662
Makes its baby brother
look like chicken shit.

457
00:27:16,432 --> 00:27:18,092
Well, I can sand down
all the runways

458
00:27:18,202 --> 00:27:20,002
and keep the plows going
between landings,

459
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:22,002
but you got to
downshift them up there,

460
00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:23,442
give me time to work.

461
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,672
You got it.

462
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:27,303
All right, everyone.

463
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:30,283
Let's call all our birds
and slow them down

464
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:33,113
before we get a parking lot
over our heads.

465
00:27:33,223 --> 00:27:35,123
The line starts
at the Mississippi,

466
00:27:35,223 --> 00:27:37,283
and they better start
taking numbers.

467
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,224
Can I get you another?

468
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:52,464
No, thank you.

469
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:54,274
I only have to
look at his face

470
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:55,744
for another 15
or 20 minutes.

471
00:27:55,844 --> 00:28:00,244
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.

472
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:02,514
I've just been informed
by Dulles Traffic Control

473
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,014
that there's a weather front
moving in ahead of us.

474
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:08,714
We may be up here
a little while longer.

475
00:28:08,824 --> 00:28:10,085
Thank you.

476
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:11,655
On second
thought...

477
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:19,995
Al?

478
00:28:20,105 --> 00:28:22,005
Hey, I'm right here,
partner.

479
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:24,935
Your stiff's dossier is
coming through right now.

480
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,205
What can you
tell me about him?

481
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:29,505
He's dead.

482
00:28:29,615 --> 00:28:31,705
You needed a computer
to figure that one out?

483
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:33,616
No, no. You don't
follow me.

484
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:35,776
According to
the Department of Defense,

485
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:37,916
he's been dead
for two years.

486
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:39,286
What?

487
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,256
That's right. Sergeant
Oswald Cochrane.

488
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:43,956
American adviser
in Honduras.

489
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,656
Killed in a helicopter
accident 5-11-88.

490
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:49,286
Officer.

491
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,796
Read between the lines,
and I'd say it looks

492
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:53,806
like a lot of black-bag
stuff to me.

493
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:55,307
Yeah, I see it.

494
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:56,967
All right, Al.
Thanks a lot.

495
00:28:57,077 --> 00:28:57,977
Hey, anytime.

496
00:28:58,077 --> 00:28:59,197
O.K.

497
00:29:00,747 --> 00:29:02,907
Say, I close
in about an hour.

498
00:29:03,017 --> 00:29:05,317
Maybe we can go
get a drink?

499
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:09,347
Just the fax, ma'am.

500
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:10,947
Just the fax.

501
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:17,758
Hey, wait a second.
Wait. I see somebody.

502
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:19,128
I'll call you back.

503
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:26,898
The Ghost
of Christmas Past.

504
00:29:27,008 --> 00:29:29,438
Nakatomi? L.A.? You're
John McClane, right?

505
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:30,938
Who are you?

506
00:29:31,048 --> 00:29:33,308
Sam Coleman.
WNTW news.

507
00:29:33,408 --> 00:29:34,808
Excuse me.

508
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:37,008
Give me a break.
I saw the stiff.

509
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:39,549
Word is that was
your handiwork.

510
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:42,049
No. I only do
needlepoint.

511
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,289
Great. National
just shut down.

512
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:51,059
Totally iced.

513
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:53,289
They're going to
be sending us their planes.

514
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:54,459
Happy, happy holiday.

515
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:55,799
The worst part,
Mr. Trudeau,

516
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:56,959
was the press.

517
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:58,629
Oh, they were
here anyways,

518
00:29:58,739 --> 00:29:59,709
crawling all over
the Esperanza story,

519
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:01,640
so they got it right
on the fucking news.

520
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,140
You know,
bloodstains and all.

521
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,300
Personally, I'd like
to lock every damn reporter

522
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,310
out of the airport,
but then they'd just pull

523
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,310
that freedom-of-speech
crap on us.

524
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,280
Then the ACLU would be
all over us.

525
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,650
Murder on television.

526
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,420
Hell of a start
for Christmas weekend.

527
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,120
What is it? A gang thing
like last time?

528
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,020
Only if your gangs get
their training at Fort Bragg.

529
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:24,401
Who the hell
is this?

530
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:25,401
Uh-uh,
McClane.

531
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:26,931
I'm a police officer.

532
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:28,501
In an unauthorized area.

533
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:30,231
L.A., Mr. Trudeau,
don't mean shit.

534
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:33,001
That's what I said
about my last
cholesterol test.

535
00:30:33,111 --> 00:30:36,801
So what's your problem,
Lieutenant McClane?

536
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:39,671
I'm sure Captain Lorenzo
has explained to you

537
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:42,941
the minor little fracas
with the minor little thieves.

538
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,682
Maybe he can explain this.

539
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:05,372
All systems
tapped, Colonel.

540
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,872
Fire it up.

541
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,823
" H" minus five minutes.

542
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,393
Stand by.

543
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:29,393
All right. We've got
a body in the morgue

544
00:31:29,503 --> 00:31:30,934
that seems
to have died twice.

545
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:32,264
Assuming it's not
a computer error,

546
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:33,534
what do we assume?

547
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:34,834
That somebody's about
to seriously fuck

548
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:35,964
with this airport.

549
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:37,774
What is that
supposed to mean?

550
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:39,774
I mean, I know we're dummies
up here, McClane,

551
00:31:39,874 --> 00:31:41,974
so give us a taste
of your genius.

552
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:43,484
This a hijacking?
A robbery? What?

553
00:31:43,584 --> 00:31:45,104
Look, I'm not sure.

554
00:31:45,214 --> 00:31:48,114
Oh, he's not sure.
Well, I'm stunned.

555
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,614
I got to lie down.

556
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:51,684
The only people that go
to this much trouble

557
00:31:51,795 --> 00:31:53,815
are professionals--
not luggage thieves and not punks.

558
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:55,355
Professional at what?

559
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:56,685
What the fuck do you
think this is, huh,

560
00:31:56,795 --> 00:31:57,885
the safety patrol here?

561
00:31:57,995 --> 00:31:59,985
This is the resume
of a professional mercenary.

562
00:32:00,095 --> 00:32:01,865
You got the world's
biggest drug dealer on his way here.

563
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:03,865
You need a slide rule
to figure this out,

564
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,665
or maybe another
body in a zipper bag

565
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:06,965
before you start
asking questions?

566
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:09,405
You're the one that gave us
that fucking body.

567
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:10,405
Remember that.

568
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:11,945
Yeah, I remember that.

569
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:21,546
Lorenzo, have all your
shift commanders report in. Now.

570
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:24,216
What? You're not
buying into this?

571
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:26,256
I want them to report
anything out of the ordinary,

572
00:32:26,356 --> 00:32:28,056
no matter how trivial.
You got that?

573
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,216
Yeah, I got it.

574
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:30,386
Oh, my God!

575
00:32:30,496 --> 00:32:31,726
What?

576
00:32:31,836 --> 00:32:33,226
The runways.

577
00:32:33,336 --> 00:32:35,166
What the hell?

578
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:36,497
They're shutting down.

579
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:37,727
Jesus Christ.

580
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:45,847
Go to emergency
lighting now.

581
00:32:45,947 --> 00:32:49,317
Emergency. We are
in a code yellow.

582
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:51,217
Backup systems
won't come up.

583
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:52,407
Shunt to another
terminal.

584
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:54,007
Bobby, what
do you got?

585
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:56,087
Nothing.
The whole network is down.

586
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:57,957
Maybe we should call
the power company, huh?

587
00:32:58,057 --> 00:32:59,858
We're on the same goddamn grid.
We're hot.

588
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,858
Dulles, what's going on?
I'm on approach.

589
00:33:01,968 --> 00:33:03,298
Maintain position. Repeat.

590
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,368
What's going on down there?

591
00:33:05,468 --> 00:33:06,628
Roger. We're on it.

592
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:07,968
We're unable right now.
Please delay.

593
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:11,468
Fuji 604. Execute published
missed-approach procedure

594
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:12,738
and hold.

595
00:33:12,838 --> 00:33:15,308
TWA 23, unable to clear you
for approach at this time.

596
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:18,108
Climb to and maintain
one zero thousand.

597
00:33:18,218 --> 00:33:21,279
I've checked all systems.
It ain't happening.

598
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:35,819
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

599
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:37,329
What's it
look like?

600
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:38,829
Approach control--
it's gone.

601
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:42,029
Jesus. Instrument
landing system is down.

602
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,570
Confirmed.
I LS is dead.

603
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,110
Every goddamn
system's dead.

604
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,680
And Inmac monitors
are down.

605
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,790
Attention all controllers.
Attention.

606
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,320
We have a code-red alert.

607
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,980
Every aircraft
approaching our sector

608
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,080
who are not already
in our landing pattern

609
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,321
gets diverted
to their alternate airport now.

610
00:34:06,431 --> 00:34:10,301
Everyone already on approach
or inside our pattern

611
00:34:10,401 --> 00:34:12,801
holds at the outer markers.

612
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:15,801
Stack 'em, pack 'em,
and rack 'em.

613
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:16,931
Move.

614
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:19,441
Get someone on it!

615
00:34:22,151 --> 00:34:25,641
All right. Not a word
of this leaves this room.

616
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:28,222
There must be 15,000 people
in this airport,

617
00:34:28,322 --> 00:34:30,882
and we don't need panic
on our hands.

618
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:33,012
We just bought ourselves
maybe two hours.

619
00:34:33,122 --> 00:34:35,022
After that,
those planes low on fuel

620
00:34:35,132 --> 00:34:36,992
aren't going to
be circling.

621
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:39,792
They're going to be dropping
on the White House lawn.

622
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:44,932
McClane, this
what you expected?

623
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,332
No.

624
00:34:47,442 --> 00:34:50,433
This is just
the beginning.

625
00:34:54,653 --> 00:34:55,983
FAA hot line.

626
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,713
How could they
know already?

627
00:34:57,813 --> 00:34:59,113
They can't.

628
00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:03,083
Maybe it's the boys
that pulled all your plugs.

629
00:35:03,193 --> 00:35:05,523
Put it on speaker.

630
00:35:05,623 --> 00:35:09,523
Attention, Dulles Tower.
Attention.

631
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:11,654
They say that blind men
become very attentive

632
00:35:11,764 --> 00:35:12,964
by way of compensation.

633
00:35:13,064 --> 00:35:14,694
Now that you're both
blind and deaf,

634
00:35:14,804 --> 00:35:16,794
I think I've got
your attention.

635
00:35:16,904 --> 00:35:19,804
I'm aware your recorders
are active,

636
00:35:19,904 --> 00:35:21,304
so I'll be quick.

637
00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:23,744
You can play me back later
to your heart's content.

638
00:35:23,844 --> 00:35:26,334
How did you get on this line?
Who is this?

639
00:35:26,444 --> 00:35:28,814
Who I am is unimportant.

640
00:35:28,914 --> 00:35:30,314
What I want...

641
00:35:30,414 --> 00:35:32,144
Well, if you don't want
those planes

642
00:35:32,254 --> 00:35:33,985
to start splashing
into the Potomac

643
00:35:34,085 --> 00:35:35,645
as they run out
of fuel,

644
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:37,455
what I want is
very important.

645
00:35:37,555 --> 00:35:39,655
Aplane will be landing
at this airport

646
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:41,095
in 58 minutes.

647
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:44,425
It is FM-1,
Foreign Military One.

648
00:35:44,535 --> 00:35:46,335
Now, I'm sure you gentlemen
are well aware

649
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,365
of the unique nature...

650
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:48,405
Esperanza?

651
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:49,665
of this flight,

652
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:50,995
the importance
of its cargo.

653
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:54,005
This plane will not
be met by anyone.

654
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:57,516
It will land on a runway
of my designation,

655
00:35:57,616 --> 00:36:00,916
where it will remain
isolated and unapproached.

656
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:03,456
That will conclude my interest
in this aircraft

657
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:05,316
and your responsibility
for it.

658
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:09,786
At the same time, I want
a 7 47 cargo conversion

659
00:36:09,896 --> 00:36:13,586
fully fueled
and placed at my disposal.

660
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:17,526
You have two more minutes
to advise your inbound aircraft

661
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:19,067
to hold at their
outer radio marker.

662
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:21,967
After that,you will be
able to receive only.

663
00:36:22,077 --> 00:36:23,907
Any attempt to restore
your systems

664
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:26,737
will be met
by severe penalties.

665
00:36:26,847 --> 00:36:27,867
He's bluffing.

666
00:36:29,247 --> 00:36:30,577
Damn it,
you can't do this.

667
00:36:30,677 --> 00:36:32,647
I am doing this.

668
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:41,478
O.K., you guys,
listen up.

669
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:43,318
I need you to punch up
a code 15.

670
00:36:43,428 --> 00:36:45,328
I got an idea,
and I need your help.

671
00:36:45,428 --> 00:36:46,628
If Esperanza gets
on that plane

672
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:48,528
and makes it to a country
with no extradition treaties,

673
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:49,828
we're fucked.

674
00:36:49,938 --> 00:36:51,998
They're talking to us
on our own system.

675
00:36:52,108 --> 00:36:53,198
They got to be close.

676
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:54,928
I'll have my men tear
this airport apart.

677
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:56,938
Just in the nick
of time, huh?

678
00:36:57,038 --> 00:36:59,238
Hey, McClane, I got
a first-class unit here,

679
00:36:59,348 --> 00:37:00,438
S.W.A.T. team and all.

680
00:37:00,548 --> 00:37:02,038
We don't need
any Monday-morning quarterbacks.

681
00:37:02,148 --> 00:37:04,449
My wife's on one
of the goddamn planes

682
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:05,449
these guys
are fucking with.

683
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:06,779
That puts me
on the playing field.

684
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:08,949
If you'd have moved your fat ass
when I told you to,

685
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:10,819
we wouldn't be hip deep
in shit right now.

686
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:12,819
That's it. Security.
You're out of here.

687
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,949
Mr. Trudeau, do I
have to remind you

688
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:16,219
about FAA regulations

689
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:17,489
regarding
unauthorized personnel

690
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,689
in the control tower?

691
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:20,819
All we have to do is find
a way to transmit.

692
00:37:20,929 --> 00:37:22,629
Yeah, right. Somebody want
to run down to Radio Shack

693
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:23,629
and get a transmitter?

694
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:24,700
We already have one.

695
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,530
The new terminal wing
they're building--

696
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,870
20 airlines
when it's done,

697
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,530
all with their own
reservation computers,

698
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,610
all tied in to a nice
big antenna arrangement.

699
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,610
You'd better see
Mr. McClane out.

700
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,480
You got no business
being up here.

701
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,480
I'm telling you guys.
Everything we need

702
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,050
is over
by the Annex Skywalk

703
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,710
just sitting there,
waiting to go on line.

704
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,720
The Annex Skywalk?

705
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,880
Goddamn it, Trudeau.

706
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,050
You're dealing
with pros here.

707
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,650
You can't fuck
with these people.

708
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,661
Sam Coleman.
WNTW news.

709
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:48,991
Mr. Trudeau, there
are a lot of rumors

710
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,061
flying around here
today.

711
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:51,391
No way. No way, lady.

712
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:52,521
Hell, no. No.

713
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:54,791
This is off limits,
Coleman.

714
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:56,391
Get them
out of here.

715
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:59,061
Anything you can think of,
they'll think of, too!

716
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:01,071
Get your fucking hands
off me.

717
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:03,071
For shit's sake.
Just get them both out of here.

718
00:38:04,511 --> 00:38:06,411
Lobby Security,
come in.

719
00:38:06,511 --> 00:38:07,411
Tomalson here.

720
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:09,112
This is
Captain Lorenzo here

721
00:38:09,222 --> 00:38:11,012
with two unauthorized personnel
in the fucking tower.

722
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,382
Now, would you get your thumb
out of your ass,

723
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:14,682
get them
out of the elevator,

724
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,692
or you're going to find
a goddamn pink slip

725
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:18,522
in your Christmas
stocking.

726
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:19,922
10-4. Let's go.

727
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:22,622
Goddamn!

728
00:38:22,732 --> 00:38:24,292
Anything who
can think of?

729
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:25,302
Can't fuck
with what guy?

730
00:38:25,402 --> 00:38:26,702
Shit. Hang on
over there.

731
00:38:26,802 --> 00:38:27,822
Just hang on.

732
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:31,373
Big drug dealer on
his way to prison,

733
00:38:31,473 --> 00:38:32,703
gunfight at airport,

734
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:34,713
every controller
in the coffee shop

735
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,373
getting beeped
and hauling ass,

736
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,883
and you rocking
the boat.

737
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,213
Connection?
Come on, McClane.

738
00:38:39,313 --> 00:38:40,373
Just a few words.

739
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:42,113
O.K.,just a few words.
Fuck off.

740
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:46,713
Thanks, but I already got
that from Colonel Stuart.

741
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:49,053
Stuart. The guy that got
canned by Congress.

742
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:50,253
That's who he was.

743
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:52,993
Huh? Who he who?
What? Hey!

744
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:56,124
Shh! It's O.K.
I've done this before.

745
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:08,404
Hi.

746
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:10,244
Where's the other one?

747
00:39:10,344 --> 00:39:11,374
Claustrophobic,
I guess.

748
00:39:13,914 --> 00:39:16,015
It's a VHF system,
but the planes are so close

749
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,285
it doesn't matter.

750
00:39:17,385 --> 00:39:19,185
I can rig our frequency
in 30 minutes,

751
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:21,025
wire in a crossover,
and we're hot.

752
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,925
Even the planes wouldn't
know the difference.

753
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:25,895
Get what you need.
Borrow. Steal. Kill.

754
00:39:25,995 --> 00:39:28,365
I want my S.W.A.T. team
to go with him as cover.

755
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:31,025
Whatever we can think of,
they can think of, too.

756
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:38,376
Oh, man. I can't
fucking believe this.

757
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,376
Another basement.
Another elevator.

758
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:44,936
How can the same shit happen
to the same guy twice?

759
00:40:06,177 --> 00:40:07,577
What the fuck?

760
00:40:07,677 --> 00:40:11,907
# You're sure to fall
in love with old #

761
00:40:12,017 --> 00:40:13,407
# Cape #

762
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:15,067
# Cod #

763
00:40:15,187 --> 00:40:16,737
# Old Cape Cod #

764
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:20,117
# That old Cape Cod #

765
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,088
# If you like the taste #

766
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:27,428
# Of a lobster stew #

767
00:40:27,528 --> 00:40:32,228
# Served by a window
with an ocean view #

768
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:33,728
# You're sure #

769
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:38,328
# You're sure to fall
in love with old #

770
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:40,808
# Cape Cod ##

771
00:40:42,578 --> 00:40:43,648
Who are you?

772
00:40:43,648 --> 00:40:44,509
Who are you?

773
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:48,139
I'm Marvin.

774
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:49,909
Marvin. I'm Marvin.

775
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:51,919
I thought
you was trying

776
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:54,119
to steal my records,
that's all.

777
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,519
I'm just the janitor.

778
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:04,219
This is Dulles Approach
to all aircraft

779
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:06,359
holding at Potomac Vortex.

780
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:09,270
We are experiencing
some technical problems here.

781
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,270
Weather conditions, which have
been deteriorating all day,

782
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:15,870
have now been complicated
by an unforeseen human factor.

783
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,710
This has affected all
of our electronic equipment

784
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,880
and their redundant backups,
as well.

785
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:25,650
As a result, our Nav
and approach systems are down,

786
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,090
and we expect to lose voice
in another minute.

787
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,591
We want you to continue

788
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:32,631
holding at the outer marker
as directed

789
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:34,661
and wait
for further instructions.

790
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:36,861
As soon as we're
back on line,

791
00:41:36,971 --> 00:41:40,061
we'll expedite your landings
on a fuel-emergency basis.

792
00:41:40,171 --> 00:41:42,661
Good luck.

793
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:47,101
God bless.

794
00:41:52,852 --> 00:41:54,042
All right.
Change the boards.

795
00:42:22,513 --> 00:42:24,143
Hey, stand back.

796
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:25,153
The Skywalk
Annex.

797
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:26,743
No, Goddamn it.
The Annex Skywalk.

798
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:29,253
It's the last thing
I heard

799
00:42:29,353 --> 00:42:30,283
before they
kicked me out.

800
00:42:30,393 --> 00:42:32,583
Well, let me
see here, now.

801
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:34,493
Well, this must be it
right there.

802
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,124
See? That's
the raised platform,

803
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:39,324
and there's
the new terminal.

804
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:40,834
There's your Skywalk.

805
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:43,134
Goddamn bottleneck.

806
00:42:43,234 --> 00:42:45,794
Nice place
for an ambush.

807
00:42:45,904 --> 00:42:47,104
What's
the fastest way

808
00:42:47,204 --> 00:42:48,864
you can get me
out to that spot?

809
00:42:51,544 --> 00:42:54,874
This kind of thing wasn't
in my job description.

810
00:42:54,984 --> 00:42:57,044
Don't worry, Mr. Barnes.
We'll watch your back.

811
00:42:57,154 --> 00:42:59,015
Yeah? Who watches yours?

812
00:43:10,165 --> 00:43:12,065
Main ventilation duct.

813
00:43:12,165 --> 00:43:14,565
Main ventilation duct.

814
00:43:14,665 --> 00:43:17,065
And bingo.

815
00:43:17,175 --> 00:43:18,405
Just once,

816
00:43:18,505 --> 00:43:21,806
I'd like a regular,
normal Christmas...

817
00:43:23,676 --> 00:43:28,586
Eggnog, a fucking
Christmas tree,

818
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:30,586
a little turkey...

819
00:43:30,686 --> 00:43:33,586
But, no, I got
to crawl around

820
00:43:33,686 --> 00:43:36,176
in this
motherfucking tin can.

821
00:43:40,596 --> 00:43:43,867
We're in the Annex Skywalk.
I can see the array.

822
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:45,897
I'll give you a call
for a protocol test

823
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:46,937
as soon as it's hot.

824
00:43:47,037 --> 00:43:48,227
That's all for now.

825
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:50,737
Sergeant, we need
some more equipment.

826
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:52,637
I'd like to send one
of your guys back for it.

827
00:43:52,747 --> 00:43:54,607
Right, sir.
You got it.

828
00:43:57,947 --> 00:43:59,707
What the hell's
going on?

829
00:43:59,817 --> 00:44:01,807
Hey! Put that
back on!

830
00:44:03,487 --> 00:44:06,718
Hey, asshole,
what do I look like to you?

831
00:44:06,828 --> 00:44:09,058
A sitting duck.

832
00:44:10,158 --> 00:44:11,958
Take him!

833
00:44:13,668 --> 00:44:14,628
Shit!

834
00:44:16,168 --> 00:44:19,568
Damn it.
I hate it when I'm right.

835
00:44:23,778 --> 00:44:25,678
Look out!
Get down!

836
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:38,919
Aah!

837
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,170
Aah!

838
00:46:05,483 --> 00:46:06,673
Stay down!

839
00:46:20,894 --> 00:46:22,224
Fuck!

840
00:46:31,344 --> 00:46:32,534
Come on.

841
00:46:53,635 --> 00:46:56,255
Fucking son
of a bitch.

842
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:03,306
Aah!

843
00:47:12,986 --> 00:47:14,246
Shit.

844
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:16,286
Ah. Oh.

845
00:47:24,697 --> 00:47:27,667
I'm going to kick
your fucking ass.

846
00:48:00,898 --> 00:48:02,368
Jeez.

847
00:48:02,468 --> 00:48:03,998
You all right?

848
00:48:04,108 --> 00:48:05,698
Yeah. Yeah.
But the antenna array--

849
00:48:05,808 --> 00:48:07,969
I got to get to it
and set it up.

850
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:14,079
Get down!

851
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,600
Goddamn.

852
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:38,470
Bait.

853
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,580
Jerk us off,

854
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,240
make Lorenzo sacrifice
his best men.

855
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,651
Make you waste
your time...

856
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:57,561
time we don't have.

857
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:14,041
I think you're closer
than 50 yards.

858
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:17,702
So's that airplane.
Practically.

859
00:49:17,812 --> 00:49:20,152
Yeah. There's quite
a few of them out there.

860
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:22,152
It looks like
a regular traffic jam.

861
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:24,282
There's nothing
regular about it.

862
00:49:24,392 --> 00:49:26,722
See? You're intrigued.

863
00:49:26,822 --> 00:49:28,382
That's my gift,
Mrs. McClane.

864
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:29,652
I notice things--

865
00:49:29,762 --> 00:49:31,562
things other people
wouldn't see.

866
00:49:31,662 --> 00:49:34,492
That's how I make
people curious.

867
00:49:34,602 --> 00:49:36,432
Don't you mean
nauseous?

868
00:49:36,532 --> 00:49:39,063
Look. The people have
a right to know

869
00:49:39,173 --> 00:49:40,573
everything about everybody.

870
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:43,003
You got
in the way of that.

871
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,943
Listen, buster, you
endangered my children,

872
00:49:46,043 --> 00:49:47,573
and you didn't do it

873
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:49,583
for anything as noble
as the people.

874
00:49:49,683 --> 00:49:51,583
The only time you even
see the people

875
00:49:51,683 --> 00:49:53,443
is when you look down

876
00:49:53,553 --> 00:49:56,143
to see what it is
you're stepping on.

877
00:49:58,183 --> 00:50:00,084
Me? Yeah, I'll live,

878
00:50:00,184 --> 00:50:02,584
but Lorenzo's
S.W.A.T. team is dead,

879
00:50:02,684 --> 00:50:05,084
and the antenna array
is gone.

880
00:50:06,184 --> 00:50:09,094
Didn't you see it?

881
00:50:09,194 --> 00:50:12,164
It's hard looking
for a new miracle.

882
00:50:13,694 --> 00:50:14,594
Just hold
for a minute.

883
00:50:14,694 --> 00:50:15,924
I'll be
right back.

884
00:50:16,034 --> 00:50:16,934
Just hold
for a second.

885
00:50:17,034 --> 00:50:17,934
Something's
going on here.

886
00:50:18,034 --> 00:50:21,095
Yeah.Just hold on
for a minute.

887
00:50:21,205 --> 00:50:25,105
I say again, Annex Team,
give us a sit rep.

888
00:50:25,205 --> 00:50:28,175
Annex Team, come in.
Do you copy?

889
00:50:29,745 --> 00:50:31,505
It's got some kind
of scrambler on it.

890
00:50:31,615 --> 00:50:33,585
Can you do anything
with it?

891
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:35,815
No.
This scramble mode

892
00:50:35,915 --> 00:50:37,815
must activate
on this code panel.

893
00:50:37,925 --> 00:50:40,045
Even if we scan
their frequency,

894
00:50:40,155 --> 00:50:41,215
we can't listen in.

895
00:50:41,325 --> 00:50:43,155
These guys are pros.

896
00:50:43,256 --> 00:50:44,286
So are you.
Break the code.

897
00:50:44,396 --> 00:50:45,416
I want to hear

898
00:50:45,526 --> 00:50:46,796
what these bastards are
saying to each other.

899
00:50:46,896 --> 00:50:48,196
This is a 10-digit
control panel.

900
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:49,286
Six-digit read-out.

901
00:50:49,396 --> 00:50:51,896
Hell, there could be
a million combinations.

902
00:50:52,006 --> 00:50:53,906
Next time you kill one
of these guys,

903
00:50:54,006 --> 00:50:55,936
get him to enter
the code first.

904
00:50:56,036 --> 00:50:57,166
Yeah.

905
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:00,136
Sir, we just
monitored a call

906
00:51:00,246 --> 00:51:01,836
from their
chief engineer.

907
00:51:01,946 --> 00:51:04,506
Our people took out
their S.W.A.T. team completely.

908
00:51:04,616 --> 00:51:06,587
You were right.
They went for the antenna array.

909
00:51:06,687 --> 00:51:07,747
We're right
on schedule.

910
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:10,817
Losing our own team
wasn't part of the plan.

911
00:51:16,197 --> 00:51:18,057
Attention, Dulles Tower.

912
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:19,857
Attention,
Dulles Control Tower.

913
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:23,027
Mr. Trudeau,
I know you're listening.

914
00:51:23,137 --> 00:51:24,757
Unfortunately,
you're not obeying.

915
00:51:24,867 --> 00:51:26,897
Try me face to face,
and we'll see.

916
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:28,838
You were warned not to try
to restore your systems.

917
00:51:28,938 --> 00:51:30,838
You've wasted lives
and precious time

918
00:51:30,948 --> 00:51:32,738
on a futile
and obvious target.

919
00:51:32,848 --> 00:51:35,578
Now you're going
to pay the penalty.

920
00:51:35,678 --> 00:51:37,878
I've got five dead officers
down here, Colonel Stuart.

921
00:51:37,988 --> 00:51:39,708
Isn't that penalty enough?

922
00:51:39,818 --> 00:51:41,188
McClane,
you keep out of this.

923
00:51:41,288 --> 00:51:42,518
You've been
nothing but a pain--

924
00:51:44,488 --> 00:51:48,358
Oh, McClane.
John McClane.

925
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:53,699
The policeman hero who saved
the Nakatomi hostages.

926
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:55,959
I read about you
in People magazine.

927
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:57,939
You seemed out of your league
on Nightline, I thought.

928
00:51:58,039 --> 00:51:59,269
Hey, Colonel,
blow me.

929
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:00,599
How much drug money

930
00:52:00,709 --> 00:52:03,399
is Esperanza paying you
to turn traitor?

931
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:05,069
Cardinal Richelieu
said it best.

932
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:07,369
Treason is merely
a matter of dates.

933
00:52:07,479 --> 00:52:09,379
This country's got to learn

934
00:52:09,479 --> 00:52:11,509
that it can't keep
cutting the legs off

935
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:13,590
of men like
General Esperanza,

936
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,680
men who have the guts
to stand up

937
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:17,190
against
Communist aggression.

938
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,590
And lesson one starts
with killing policemen?

939
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,600
What's lesson two--
the neutron bomb?

940
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,220
No. I think we can find
something in between.

941
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,170
Watch this.

942
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,641
Give me
a flight number,

943
00:52:34,741 --> 00:52:36,571
one that's
low on fuel.

944
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:38,771
Windsor 114.
Transatlantic from London.

945
00:52:38,881 --> 00:52:41,851
Fuel tank's
dry as a martini.

946
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:44,251
Activate the I LS
landing system,

947
00:52:44,351 --> 00:52:46,051
but recalibrate
sea level

948
00:52:46,151 --> 00:52:49,721
minus 200 feet.

949
00:53:13,822 --> 00:53:15,182
Oh,Jesus!

950
00:53:15,282 --> 00:53:17,582
They've reset ground level
minus 200 feet.

951
00:53:18,753 --> 00:53:20,313
Windsor flight 114.

952
00:53:20,423 --> 00:53:21,623
This is Dulles Approach.

953
00:53:21,723 --> 00:53:23,453
Do you copy?

954
00:53:23,563 --> 00:53:26,053
Dulles Approach,
this is Windsor 114.

955
00:53:26,163 --> 00:53:27,633
Where the devil
have you been?

956
00:53:27,733 --> 00:53:29,323
Windsor 114.
Dulles Approach.

957
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:32,333
We've been right here
all along, old buddy.

958
00:53:32,433 --> 00:53:34,923
Our systems only came back
on line just this very second.

959
00:53:35,043 --> 00:53:39,273
Windsor 114, you are cleared
for ILS approach,

960
00:53:39,373 --> 00:53:40,774
runway two-niner.

961
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,784
Contact Dulles Tower frequency
at the outer marker.

962
00:53:43,884 --> 00:53:44,784
Jesus Christ,

963
00:53:44,884 --> 00:53:46,144
he's going to crash
the fucking plane!

964
00:53:46,254 --> 00:53:47,814
Roger, Approach,
and about time.

965
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:50,984
I've got 230 people up here
flying on petrol fumes.

966
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:52,554
Roger, 114. Understand.

967
00:53:52,654 --> 00:53:54,144
Calibrate Dulles
altimeter...

968
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,194
Oh,Jesus.

969
00:53:55,294 --> 00:53:57,664
They'll fly
right into the concrete.

970
00:53:57,764 --> 00:53:58,784
Son of a bitch!

971
00:53:58,894 --> 00:54:00,864
Why are they
listening to him?

972
00:54:00,964 --> 00:54:02,334
It's our frequency!
Why shouldn't they?

973
00:54:02,434 --> 00:54:03,695
Dulles,
this is Windsor 114.

974
00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:05,065
Barnes!

975
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,075
This is Dulles Tower.
We have radar contact...

976
00:54:08,175 --> 00:54:10,165
Give me your coat!

977
00:54:10,275 --> 00:54:12,245
Windsor 114, stand by...

978
00:54:12,345 --> 00:54:13,315
What are you
going to do?

979
00:54:13,415 --> 00:54:16,145
Whatever I can.

980
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:21,045
Ladies and gentlemen,

981
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:23,175
as you've probably noticed,
we've started our descent.

982
00:54:23,285 --> 00:54:25,126
We're sorry
for the inconvenience,

983
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:28,126
but we'll all be on the ground
in a few minutes. Thank you.

984
00:54:28,226 --> 00:54:30,126
Please keep
your seat belts on.

985
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:31,256
Oh, not to worry.

986
00:54:31,366 --> 00:54:33,126
We've made arrangements
for your next flight,

987
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,136
so you won't
miss it, O.K.?

988
00:54:35,236 --> 00:54:36,636
In your seat, please.

989
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:38,636
Come on, in your seat.

990
00:54:38,736 --> 00:54:39,636
Oh, hey.

991
00:54:39,736 --> 00:54:42,136
We're just like
British Rail, love.

992
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:44,646
We may be late,
but we get you there.

993
00:54:44,746 --> 00:54:46,236
Don't worry.

994
00:55:02,267 --> 00:55:03,857
Good luck, McClane!

995
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:29,018
Dulles, this is Windsor 114,

996
00:55:29,128 --> 00:55:31,588
inside the outer marker.

997
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:34,129
Roger, 114.
This is Dulles Tower.

998
00:55:34,229 --> 00:55:36,629
We have radar contact
and show you on I LS.

999
00:55:36,729 --> 00:55:39,399
You're in the glide path,
and you're looking good.

1000
00:55:48,709 --> 00:55:50,199
There's somebody
out there!

1001
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,310
It's McClane.

1002
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,250
Christ.

1003
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,760
Approach flaps.

1004
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,660
Approach flaps.

1005
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,290
Approach speed 140.

1006
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,660
Approach speed 140.

1007
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:11,390
130.

1008
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,830
Altitude 1,000 feet.

1009
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,000
800, guys!
You're only at 800 feet!

1010
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:17,271
Fire and Rescue,
this is Cummings.

1011
00:56:17,381 --> 00:56:19,401
Roll everything
out to runway two-niner!

1012
00:56:19,511 --> 00:56:22,071
Ref speed plus 20.

1013
00:56:22,181 --> 00:56:23,981
600 feet.

1014
00:56:25,221 --> 00:56:26,681
Looking good, Windsor.

1015
00:56:26,781 --> 00:56:28,121
Now, watch it.

1016
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:31,121
30-knot crosswinds,
and the runway is icy.

1017
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,121
Atta boy. We've got you.

1018
00:56:34,231 --> 00:56:35,691
We've got you.

1019
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,202
Pull it up!

1020
00:56:51,382 --> 00:56:52,772
Jesus!

1021
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,653
Aah! We're going to die!

1022
00:57:07,763 --> 00:57:09,283
We've got you.

1023
00:57:33,224 --> 00:57:34,714
No...

1024
00:57:35,824 --> 00:57:37,314
God.

1025
00:57:41,734 --> 00:57:43,724
Motherfucker.

1026
00:57:46,135 --> 00:57:48,225
Motherfucker.

1027
00:57:52,245 --> 00:57:53,705
Oh,Jesus.

1028
00:58:04,855 --> 00:58:06,755
That concludes
our object lesson

1029
00:58:06,855 --> 00:58:08,256
for this evening.

1030
00:58:08,356 --> 00:58:11,656
If the 7 47 we requested
is ready on time

1031
00:58:11,766 --> 00:58:14,166
and General Esperanza's plane
arrives unmolested,

1032
00:58:14,266 --> 00:58:16,166
further lessons
can be avoided.

1033
00:58:16,266 --> 00:58:17,526
Out.

1034
00:59:04,078 --> 00:59:06,638
We got no sign
of survivors down here.

1035
00:59:06,748 --> 00:59:08,238
It's a goddamn nightmare.

1036
00:59:09,858 --> 00:59:12,488
Hey, Nelson!
Come here.

1037
00:59:22,469 --> 00:59:23,699
Barnes!

1038
00:59:24,909 --> 00:59:26,269
We've got to
warn those planes

1039
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:28,199
there's a lunatic
down here.

1040
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:30,329
Get up to the cabin.
Get me on the air.

1041
00:59:30,439 --> 00:59:31,339
How?

1042
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:32,779
You figure it out!

1043
00:59:32,879 --> 00:59:34,309
Here's the manifest.

1044
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,730
McClane, I know
how you must feel.

1045
01:00:02,281 --> 01:00:05,341
I wanted to help
those people.

1046
01:00:06,751 --> 01:00:09,981
I was pretty
goddamn useless.

1047
01:00:12,751 --> 01:00:15,151
We called
the government for help.

1048
01:00:15,261 --> 01:00:19,091
They're going to send in
a special Army unit,

1049
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:21,182
a counterterrorist team.

1050
01:00:28,202 --> 01:00:31,102
Your wife's plane?

1051
01:00:31,212 --> 01:00:32,502
Well, they're
still broadcasting

1052
01:00:32,612 --> 01:00:34,972
even though
we can't answer them.

1053
01:00:36,982 --> 01:00:40,042
They're going to run out of fuel
in 90 minutes.

1054
01:00:51,733 --> 01:00:53,123
Listen, Dick.

1055
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:54,963
That is your name?

1056
01:00:55,063 --> 01:00:56,153
Dick.

1057
01:00:56,263 --> 01:00:58,133
If you're going to continue
to get this close,

1058
01:00:58,233 --> 01:01:00,133
do you think
you might consider

1059
01:01:00,233 --> 01:01:01,603
switching
after-shaves?

1060
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:04,934
Anything else?

1061
01:01:05,044 --> 01:01:08,104
Stronger mouthwash
might be nice.

1062
01:01:08,214 --> 01:01:09,304
And here's Sam Coleman

1063
01:01:09,414 --> 01:01:11,144
reporting live
from the site of the accident.

1064
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:12,304
Well, Colonel,

1065
01:01:12,414 --> 01:01:14,144
they've done everything
we've anticipated...

1066
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:15,654
so far.

1067
01:01:15,754 --> 01:01:17,884
But still there has been
no official word.

1068
01:01:17,994 --> 01:01:20,084
Meanwhile, despite the fact

1069
01:01:20,194 --> 01:01:23,094
only one runway has been
closed due to the tragedy,

1070
01:01:23,194 --> 01:01:25,994
several dozen airliners are
visible from where I stand,

1071
01:01:26,094 --> 01:01:27,495
endlessly
circling the field.

1072
01:01:27,595 --> 01:01:30,095
Other reports say that
there was trouble in the tower

1073
01:01:30,205 --> 01:01:31,605
before the crash

1074
01:01:31,705 --> 01:01:33,465
and that that may have even
contributed to it.

1075
01:01:33,575 --> 01:01:34,665
One thing is certain.

1076
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:36,135
With weather conditions
worsening,

1077
01:01:36,245 --> 01:01:38,145
the problem here
and in the sky above us

1078
01:01:38,245 --> 01:01:39,645
will continue to grow.

1079
01:01:39,745 --> 01:01:43,045
I'm Samantha Coleman at Dulles
International Airport.

1080
01:01:50,086 --> 01:01:51,056
Victor. Victor.

1081
01:01:51,156 --> 01:01:52,056
Victor.

1082
01:01:52,156 --> 01:01:53,216
Yeah, what's up?

1083
01:01:53,326 --> 01:01:54,656
Did you pack the radio mikes
from the shoot,

1084
01:01:54,766 --> 01:01:56,156
or did you put them
in your carry-on?

1085
01:01:56,266 --> 01:01:57,316
Are you crazy?

1086
01:01:57,426 --> 01:01:58,826
I wouldn't let those assholes
check them in.

1087
01:01:58,936 --> 01:02:00,156
I love you.

1088
01:02:00,266 --> 01:02:02,256
Give me one
of the receivers.

1089
01:02:06,276 --> 01:02:09,676
Can you tune in
to the cockpit frequency?

1090
01:02:09,776 --> 01:02:11,177
Yeah. Why?

1091
01:02:11,277 --> 01:02:14,007
I want to hear
what's going on.

1092
01:02:15,117 --> 01:02:18,147
Should be right here
on our band.

1093
01:02:18,257 --> 01:02:19,587
Nothing.

1094
01:02:19,687 --> 01:02:20,587
You just told me
it would work.

1095
01:02:20,687 --> 01:02:21,587
Is it working
or not working?

1096
01:02:21,687 --> 01:02:22,587
It is working,
but it's--

1097
01:02:22,687 --> 01:02:23,677
All I'm getting

1098
01:02:23,787 --> 01:02:26,187
is some kind
of airport beacon.

1099
01:02:26,297 --> 01:02:27,187
It's weird.

1100
01:02:27,297 --> 01:02:30,127
It's like the tower
isn't there.

1101
01:02:31,797 --> 01:02:33,288
Stay on it.

1102
01:02:34,538 --> 01:02:36,728
Let me know when there is
something there.

1103
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:38,138
O.K.

1104
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:18,180
Major Grant.
We're Blue Light.

1105
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,180
Rollins, Department
ofJustice.

1106
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,180
Trudeau, Chief
of Air Operations.

1107
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:23,550
Lorenzo,
Terminal Police.

1108
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:25,550
You want something,
you got it.

1109
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,620
This is it?

1110
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,660
One fucking platoon?

1111
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,130
One Crisis-1 Platoon.
Who are you?

1112
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,320
John McClane.

1113
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:35,230
McClane, you showed
some balls out there, man.

1114
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:36,230
Yeah.

1115
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:38,730
Now show some
good sense.

1116
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,431
Let the pros
handle this.

1117
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:42,201
Yeah, well,
it looks like

1118
01:03:42,311 --> 01:03:43,711
the pros are on
the wrong team tonight.

1119
01:03:43,811 --> 01:03:45,041
Isn't Colonel Stuart
one of your men?

1120
01:03:45,141 --> 01:03:46,701
No, not anymore,
he's not.

1121
01:03:46,811 --> 01:03:47,711
Now we're here

1122
01:03:47,811 --> 01:03:48,901
to take Colonel
Stuart down.

1123
01:03:49,011 --> 01:03:51,241
And we will
take him down.

1124
01:03:51,351 --> 01:03:52,711
You see,
I served with him.

1125
01:03:52,821 --> 01:03:54,511
I taught him
everything he knows.

1126
01:03:54,621 --> 01:03:56,211
Well, maybe
he's learned

1127
01:03:56,321 --> 01:03:58,351
a few more things
since then.

1128
01:03:59,821 --> 01:04:00,851
Let's hustle!

1129
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:02,652
The command post
will be set up

1130
01:04:02,762 --> 01:04:04,162
in the airport
police station.

1131
01:04:04,262 --> 01:04:06,162
I want to be
tied in to the tower

1132
01:04:06,262 --> 01:04:07,162
in 15 minutes.

1133
01:04:07,262 --> 01:04:09,262
All right,
let's do it!

1134
01:04:10,372 --> 01:04:11,932
Hey, Trudeau.

1135
01:04:13,442 --> 01:04:16,272
Did things just get
better or worse?

1136
01:04:20,682 --> 01:04:22,612
Lights--
big, portable lights.

1137
01:04:22,712 --> 01:04:24,773
We set up the field,
and then we--

1138
01:04:24,883 --> 01:04:25,943
We wait for those lunatics
to shoot them out.

1139
01:04:26,053 --> 01:04:28,113
And where do we get
those big, portable lights--

1140
01:04:28,223 --> 01:04:29,123
Borrow them
from Batman?

1141
01:04:29,223 --> 01:04:31,123
What about
the airphone idea?

1142
01:04:31,223 --> 01:04:32,123
There's 18 planes
up there.

1143
01:04:32,223 --> 01:04:34,023
Only five of them
have those phones.

1144
01:04:34,123 --> 01:04:35,023
We got through
to three of them.

1145
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:36,493
We're still trying
on the others.

1146
01:04:36,593 --> 01:04:38,323
That leaves 13 accidents
waiting to happen.

1147
01:04:38,433 --> 01:04:39,333
Are they still
bucking head winds?

1148
01:04:39,433 --> 01:04:40,333
I just checked
the weather.

1149
01:04:40,433 --> 01:04:41,493
Head winds are
slamming everybody

1150
01:04:41,603 --> 01:04:42,503
over the outer marker.

1151
01:04:42,603 --> 01:04:43,663
The planes
with enough fuel

1152
01:04:43,773 --> 01:04:45,673
have already been
shunted to Atlanta,

1153
01:04:45,773 --> 01:04:47,174
Memphis, and Nashville.

1154
01:04:47,274 --> 01:04:49,004
Outer marker.

1155
01:04:49,114 --> 01:04:51,014
Damn!

1156
01:04:51,114 --> 01:04:52,674
The outer marker!

1157
01:04:52,784 --> 01:04:54,184
It's a beacon, right?

1158
01:04:54,284 --> 01:04:56,184
It sends out this
"beep beep beep"

1159
01:04:56,284 --> 01:04:57,844
so they know they're
over it, right?

1160
01:04:57,954 --> 01:04:59,184
So?

1161
01:04:59,284 --> 01:05:00,274
So who says
that radio signal

1162
01:05:00,384 --> 01:05:01,324
has to just beep?

1163
01:05:01,424 --> 01:05:02,684
Right.
We switch the frequency

1164
01:05:02,794 --> 01:05:04,154
from the tower
over to the one in the beacon.

1165
01:05:04,254 --> 01:05:06,024
We pump up the wattage.

1166
01:05:06,124 --> 01:05:07,094
And we can talk
to our planes,

1167
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,094
and those bastards
who did this

1168
01:05:08,194 --> 01:05:09,185
will never know!

1169
01:05:12,735 --> 01:05:14,135
Traced the signal.

1170
01:05:14,235 --> 01:05:15,705
Found it in
the luggage area.

1171
01:05:15,805 --> 01:05:16,705
They've been tapped in

1172
01:05:16,805 --> 01:05:18,465
to your tower chatter
all night.

1173
01:05:18,575 --> 01:05:20,565
Punks stealing luggage,
huh, Carmine?

1174
01:05:24,245 --> 01:05:25,645
How you doing,
Telford?

1175
01:05:25,745 --> 01:05:26,645
No good.

1176
01:05:26,745 --> 01:05:27,645
I called Lang.

1177
01:05:27,745 --> 01:05:29,145
They're rigging
a portable decoder.

1178
01:05:29,255 --> 01:05:30,415
It'll be here
in two hours.

1179
01:05:30,515 --> 01:05:32,146
My wife doesn't
have two hours.

1180
01:05:32,256 --> 01:05:34,656
I was only transferred
to Grant's team yesterday.

1181
01:05:34,756 --> 01:05:36,656
The regular guy
got appendicitis.

1182
01:05:36,756 --> 01:05:39,596
Word is, nobody's better
at this than Major Grant.

1183
01:05:39,696 --> 01:05:40,996
Attention!

1184
01:05:41,096 --> 01:05:43,656
Except maybe
Colonel Stuart.

1185
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:45,666
I want to hear about

1186
01:05:45,766 --> 01:05:47,926
the plane
those bastards asked for.

1187
01:05:48,036 --> 01:05:49,236
Then I'll fill you in
on my orders.

1188
01:05:49,336 --> 01:05:51,166
Pilots' briefing room.
Now.

1189
01:05:51,276 --> 01:05:52,176
Keep working.

1190
01:05:52,276 --> 01:05:54,247
Albertson.
With me.

1191
01:05:58,987 --> 01:06:01,007
No civilians.

1192
01:06:11,797 --> 01:06:13,557
What the fuck?

1193
01:06:13,667 --> 01:06:15,688
What is it?

1194
01:06:15,798 --> 01:06:17,628
The outer marker beeper.

1195
01:06:17,738 --> 01:06:20,898
It isn't beeping.
It's talking.

1196
01:06:21,008 --> 01:06:23,138
Attention all aircraft
in Dulles landing pattern.

1197
01:06:23,238 --> 01:06:25,298
This is Chief Engineer
Leslie Barnes.

1198
01:06:25,408 --> 01:06:28,138
I have been authorized
to brief you in full.

1199
01:06:28,248 --> 01:06:32,648
At this time, this is the only
channel available to us.

1200
01:06:32,748 --> 01:06:35,148
Here is the situation.

1201
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:37,489
Approximately two hours ago...

1202
01:06:40,259 --> 01:06:42,159
Wait until you
get a load of this.

1203
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:44,659
Do not accept any instructions
claiming to be from our tower

1204
01:06:44,769 --> 01:06:47,359
unless you hear your own
flight recoder access code.

1205
01:06:47,469 --> 01:06:48,529
The terrorists
have got all...

1206
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:49,529
Holy shit!

1207
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:50,529
our systems and now...

1208
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:51,899
Get this on tape!

1209
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:53,529
have control of everything
except this channel.

1210
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:55,069
Give us a second
here, please.

1211
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:57,669
This channel is secure.
Your own transmissions are not.

1212
01:06:57,779 --> 01:07:00,680
Do not, repeat,
do not attempt

1213
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,540
to reply on
your own frequencies

1214
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:03,840
to this broadcast.

1215
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:06,010
These people have already
caused one crash

1216
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,140
by impersonating our tower.

1217
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,240
Jesus.

1218
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,290
Repeat. The terrorists
have cut off

1219
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,131
the two systems that can
allow you to land--

1220
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:26,141
field lights
for a visual landing

1221
01:07:26,241 --> 01:07:28,141
and the ILS
for an instrument.

1222
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:31,141
A special U.S. Army unit
is already here

1223
01:07:31,241 --> 01:07:32,511
and preparing to take out
the terrorists.

1224
01:07:32,611 --> 01:07:33,641
My God.

1225
01:07:33,751 --> 01:07:34,941
Don't accept
any instructions...

1226
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,141
Yo, Marvin.

1227
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:38,151
Hey, you interested
in a nice coat?

1228
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:39,651
No. It never looked
good on me anyway.

1229
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:41,311
Listen, you've
got to get me

1230
01:07:41,421 --> 01:07:42,451
up to the pilots'
briefing room.

1231
01:07:42,561 --> 01:07:46,152
I've got to hear
what they're saying.

1232
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:47,662
Which one of these maps
gets me in there?

1233
01:07:47,762 --> 01:07:48,662
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!

1234
01:07:48,762 --> 01:07:49,662
Find the map,
Marvin.

1235
01:07:49,762 --> 01:07:50,822
I'll find it.

1236
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:52,662
You'll mess up my whole
damn filing system here.

1237
01:07:52,772 --> 01:07:54,172
Let's see.
Pilots' Briefing Room.

1238
01:07:54,272 --> 01:07:56,002
I think that's
in the main terminal,

1239
01:07:56,102 --> 01:07:59,872
so would that be under
"P" for Pilots' Briefing Room?

1240
01:07:59,972 --> 01:08:01,342
Or maybe it would be

1241
01:08:01,442 --> 01:08:03,912
under " M"
for Miscellaneous.

1242
01:08:08,013 --> 01:08:09,313
Oh, shit!

1243
01:08:09,423 --> 01:08:11,353
Request permission
to reduce sentry duty

1244
01:08:11,453 --> 01:08:12,983
to 30-minute rotation.

1245
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:15,053
My men are getting cold
and antsy. Over.

1246
01:08:15,163 --> 01:08:16,493
This is Colonel Stuart.

1247
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:19,083
Have the men not on watch
assemble for a briefing.

1248
01:08:19,193 --> 01:08:20,093
Roger, Colonel.

1249
01:08:20,193 --> 01:08:21,353
What's the matter?

1250
01:08:21,463 --> 01:08:24,123
Oh...

1251
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:26,633
Gentlemen...

1252
01:08:26,733 --> 01:08:29,134
Tonight, the pattern ends.

1253
01:08:29,244 --> 01:08:31,704
The dominoes
will fall no more,

1254
01:08:31,814 --> 01:08:33,334
and the ramparts
will remain upright.

1255
01:08:33,444 --> 01:08:34,934
Sir, General
Esperanza's plane

1256
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:36,844
just came
on the scope.

1257
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:45,384
Attention, Dulles Tower.

1258
01:08:45,494 --> 01:08:47,724
We will be
lighting up a runway.

1259
01:08:47,824 --> 01:08:51,355
Do not, repeat, do not
attempt to land any planes.

1260
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:54,365
Remember,
we're monitoring you.

1261
01:08:57,265 --> 01:08:58,755
What do we do?

1262
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:00,965
Obey.

1263
01:09:07,115 --> 01:09:10,705
Dulles Tower
to Fox Trot Michael One.

1264
01:09:10,815 --> 01:09:12,545
Dulles Tower
to Fox Trot Michael One.

1265
01:09:12,656 --> 01:09:14,386
This is Fox Trot
Michael One, Dulles.

1266
01:09:14,486 --> 01:09:15,916
We read you. Over.

1267
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,386
Fox Trot Michael One,
you are to come in

1268
01:09:18,496 --> 01:09:21,896
on runway 1-5,
repeat, 1-5.

1269
01:09:35,807 --> 01:09:37,837
I found it on the floor,
by the coat,

1270
01:09:37,947 --> 01:09:39,847
next to
the luggage belt.

1271
01:09:39,947 --> 01:09:42,347
What the hell you so excited
about that for?

1272
01:09:42,447 --> 01:09:43,887
The code's still punched
into this one.

1273
01:09:43,987 --> 01:09:45,347
You like it, huh?

1274
01:09:45,457 --> 01:09:47,547
How about giving me
20 bucks for it?

1275
01:09:47,657 --> 01:09:49,847
How about
I let you live?

1276
01:09:51,457 --> 01:09:53,517
Man knows how
to bargain.

1277
01:09:53,627 --> 01:09:56,027
This is contrary
to our instructions.

1278
01:09:56,127 --> 01:09:58,928
We are to land
at runway 1-0,

1279
01:09:59,038 --> 01:10:00,018
where we are
to be met

1280
01:10:00,138 --> 01:10:02,898
by representatives
of your justice de--

1281
01:10:03,008 --> 01:10:04,868
Captain, please
tell the tower

1282
01:10:04,978 --> 01:10:07,408
you will proceed
as ordered.

1283
01:10:18,418 --> 01:10:20,649
Roger, Dulles.

1284
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:23,319
Proceeding
to runway 1-5.

1285
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:41,340
Foxtrot Michael One.
Come in, please.

1286
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:44,350
What are you
going to do now?

1287
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,850
Are you going
to shoot me?

1288
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,280
So who will
fly the plane?

1289
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,850
Don't worry about it.

1290
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,680
It's not your problem.

1291
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,820
Michael One.
Do you copy?

1292
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,271
Foxtrot Michael One.
Come in, please.

1293
01:11:13,981 --> 01:11:15,471
Eagle Nest.

1294
01:11:15,581 --> 01:11:17,381
This is Falcon.
Mayday.

1295
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:20,421
Eagle Nest.
This is Falcon. Mayday!

1296
01:11:22,251 --> 01:11:23,881
Go ahead, Falcon.

1297
01:11:23,991 --> 01:11:27,052
I've lost cabin pressure.
Near zero visibility.

1298
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:30,022
I must drop out
of this weather and land now,

1299
01:11:30,132 --> 01:11:32,032
on the first
accessible runway.

1300
01:11:32,132 --> 01:11:33,432
Repeat.

1301
01:11:33,532 --> 01:11:36,432
I've lost cabin pressure.
Near zero visibility.

1302
01:11:36,532 --> 01:11:38,502
I must drop out
of the storm.

1303
01:11:38,602 --> 01:11:40,832
I can land,
but I must land now,

1304
01:11:40,942 --> 01:11:43,002
on the first
outgoing runway.

1305
01:11:43,112 --> 01:11:45,872
Repeat. I cannot
circle around

1306
01:11:45,982 --> 01:11:47,442
to runway 1-5.

1307
01:11:50,953 --> 01:11:52,853
I'll make you
a deal, Marvin.

1308
01:11:52,953 --> 01:11:54,853
You show me a shortcut
out to those runways,

1309
01:11:54,953 --> 01:11:56,323
and I'll get you
a liner for that coat.

1310
01:11:56,423 --> 01:11:59,583
Repeat. I cannot circle around
to runway 1-5.

1311
01:11:59,693 --> 01:12:00,593
Shit.

1312
01:12:00,693 --> 01:12:01,923
Stand by, Falcon.

1313
01:12:03,963 --> 01:12:04,863
Here, sir.

1314
01:12:04,963 --> 01:12:06,623
He's coming in
from the ocean.

1315
01:12:08,973 --> 01:12:11,374
A bullet
has damaged my instruments.

1316
01:12:11,474 --> 01:12:13,374
I'm not sure
of my bearings,

1317
01:12:13,474 --> 01:12:15,774
and I must make
a visual landing immediately.

1318
01:12:15,874 --> 01:12:17,364
Do you copy, Eagle Nest?

1319
01:12:17,474 --> 01:12:18,674
Roger, Falcon.

1320
01:12:18,784 --> 01:12:20,614
That would be
2-5 right.

1321
01:12:20,714 --> 01:12:22,874
Repeat. 2-5 right.

1322
01:12:22,984 --> 01:12:26,214
Make up
your fucking mind!

1323
01:12:26,324 --> 01:12:29,224
Oh, we are just up to our ass
in terrorists again,John.

1324
01:12:29,324 --> 01:12:30,754
Affirmative.
2-5 right. Over.

1325
01:12:30,854 --> 01:12:32,255
2-5 right.

1326
01:12:34,765 --> 01:12:35,925
I've got to quit
smoking cigarettes.

1327
01:12:37,495 --> 01:12:39,435
Thank you for telling me,
Eagle Nest.

1328
01:12:39,535 --> 01:12:41,725
But if you could
show it to me as well,

1329
01:12:41,835 --> 01:12:43,495
I would be grateful.

1330
01:12:54,185 --> 01:12:55,586
I see the lights.

1331
01:12:55,686 --> 01:12:57,916
They are directly
in front of me.

1332
01:12:58,016 --> 01:12:59,416
Gracias, compadre.

1333
01:12:59,526 --> 01:13:02,426
Reducing air speed.
Approaching runway.

1334
01:13:02,526 --> 01:13:03,926
Wish me luck.

1335
01:13:04,026 --> 01:13:05,516
Roger, Falcon.

1336
01:13:06,696 --> 01:13:09,066
We copy. We'll have you
in five minutes.

1337
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:10,566
That's right, asshole.

1338
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:12,366
We'll have you
in five minutes.

1339
01:13:35,997 --> 01:13:37,897
I see your lights.

1340
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,558
ETA 90 seconds.

1341
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:50,978
Come to papa, scumbag.

1342
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,280
Uhh!

1343
01:14:46,271 --> 01:14:47,461
Oh, shit!

1344
01:14:48,941 --> 01:14:49,991
Unh! Oh.

1345
01:14:58,381 --> 01:14:59,781
No!

1346
01:15:47,663 --> 01:15:48,923
Freedom.

1347
01:15:50,663 --> 01:15:51,964
Not yet.

1348
01:15:53,904 --> 01:15:55,394
You're supposed
to stay in your seat

1349
01:15:55,504 --> 01:15:56,904
until the plane
reaches the terminal.

1350
01:15:57,004 --> 01:15:59,604
No frequent-flier
mileage for you.

1351
01:15:59,714 --> 01:16:00,804
Who are you?

1352
01:16:00,914 --> 01:16:01,974
A cop.

1353
01:16:02,084 --> 01:16:02,974
A cop?

1354
01:16:03,084 --> 01:16:03,974
Yeah, one of
the good guys.

1355
01:16:04,084 --> 01:16:05,704
You're one of
the bad guys,

1356
01:16:05,814 --> 01:16:07,404
and now that I got
your sorry ass,

1357
01:16:07,514 --> 01:16:08,614
I'm going to trade it
for my wife.

1358
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:18,855
Sit down!

1359
01:16:22,365 --> 01:16:24,395
Go in!

1360
01:16:30,075 --> 01:16:30,975
Where did he go?

1361
01:16:31,075 --> 01:16:32,065
In there.

1362
01:16:42,286 --> 01:16:43,186
I don't believe this.

1363
01:16:43,286 --> 01:16:44,886
Two months
of planning,

1364
01:16:44,986 --> 01:16:46,886
and you can't anticipate
one pendejo of a cop.

1365
01:16:46,996 --> 01:16:47,886
Come on, General.

1366
01:16:47,996 --> 01:16:49,396
Where the hell
is Colonel Stuart?

1367
01:16:53,496 --> 01:16:54,396
General!

1368
01:16:54,496 --> 01:16:55,656
Ah! I'm all right.

1369
01:16:55,766 --> 01:16:57,896
He said he was
a policeman.

1370
01:16:58,006 --> 01:16:59,767
I thought you had
this place secured.

1371
01:16:59,877 --> 01:17:01,897
He went in the cockpit.

1372
01:17:02,007 --> 01:17:03,877
He's going to hell!

1373
01:17:04,007 --> 01:17:05,107
McClane!

1374
01:17:05,207 --> 01:17:08,907
I assume
it's you, McClane.

1375
01:17:09,017 --> 01:17:11,417
You're quite
a little soldier.

1376
01:17:11,517 --> 01:17:15,507
You can consider this
a military funeral!

1377
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:33,438
Aah!

1378
01:17:38,608 --> 01:17:40,948
How many grenades
we got?

1379
01:17:41,048 --> 01:17:43,209
Three each!

1380
01:17:43,319 --> 01:17:44,379
Use them!

1381
01:17:54,499 --> 01:17:55,829
Oh, my--

1382
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,240
Go!

1383
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,861
Aah!

1384
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:30,521
Oh, shit!

1385
01:18:38,981 --> 01:18:41,381
You lucky fuck.

1386
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:45,911
Fire trucks, sir.

1387
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:48,981
Fall back
to the church. Now!

1388
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:13,033
Where's the fucking door?

1389
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:29,363
They're getting a little
nervous back there.

1390
01:19:29,463 --> 01:19:30,863
In fact, so am I.

1391
01:19:30,963 --> 01:19:32,363
We're right over
Washington.

1392
01:19:32,463 --> 01:19:33,663
See if you
can get any TV.

1393
01:19:33,763 --> 01:19:34,734
That will
settle them down.

1394
01:19:34,834 --> 01:19:37,704
Works for me.
I'll--

1395
01:20:00,895 --> 01:20:02,295
Writing
your acceptance speech

1396
01:20:02,395 --> 01:20:04,295
for the Video Sleaze
Awards?

1397
01:20:04,395 --> 01:20:05,885
Try Pulitzer.

1398
01:20:06,005 --> 01:20:07,335
Ladies and gentlemen,

1399
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:09,925
while waiting to land,
our cabin attendants

1400
01:20:10,035 --> 01:20:11,235
are turning on
local Washington broadcasting.

1401
01:20:11,335 --> 01:20:13,275
The sound is on channel three.

1402
01:20:19,946 --> 01:20:20,846
O.K.

1403
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:22,576
O.K., O.K.

1404
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:33,356
Please, sir, we may
land at any moment.

1405
01:20:33,466 --> 01:20:34,866
If you'll
take your seat--

1406
01:20:34,966 --> 01:20:36,366
I'm going to be sick.

1407
01:20:36,466 --> 01:20:37,766
Excuse me.
I'm going to be sick.

1408
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:39,956
Sir, the seat belt
light is on.

1409
01:20:43,907 --> 01:20:45,277
Moron.

1410
01:20:45,377 --> 01:20:46,277
WZDC.

1411
01:20:46,377 --> 01:20:47,307
Yes, this is
Richard Thornberg.

1412
01:20:47,407 --> 01:20:48,537
Put me through to Ruben
in the newsroom.

1413
01:20:48,647 --> 01:20:49,877
Uh, he's
about to go live.

1414
01:20:49,977 --> 01:20:51,377
I know he's
about to go on.

1415
01:20:51,477 --> 01:20:52,877
That's why I need him.

1416
01:20:52,987 --> 01:20:54,377
You'll have to hold on--

1417
01:20:54,487 --> 01:20:55,887
Put me through, Celia,

1418
01:20:55,987 --> 01:20:57,617
or start typing
your resume.

1419
01:20:57,717 --> 01:20:57,817
Esperanza's down--

1420
01:20:57,817 --> 01:21:00,287
Esperanza's down--

1421
01:21:00,387 --> 01:21:02,377
But he's hurt.

1422
01:21:02,497 --> 01:21:04,398
He took a round
in his shoulder.

1423
01:21:04,498 --> 01:21:06,398
Plus I got
one more of their guys.

1424
01:21:06,498 --> 01:21:08,188
That's six
they lost altogether.

1425
01:21:08,298 --> 01:21:09,888
Maybe if we knew how many
they had to start with,

1426
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:11,228
we could get excited,

1427
01:21:11,338 --> 01:21:12,458
but if they got 50 guys,

1428
01:21:12,568 --> 01:21:15,038
it's a little early
to break out the champagne!

1429
01:21:15,138 --> 01:21:16,568
Now, we appreciate
your effort, McClane,

1430
01:21:16,678 --> 01:21:19,078
but we don't need
a loose cannon on this deck!

1431
01:21:19,178 --> 01:21:20,338
What if they decide
to crash another plane

1432
01:21:20,448 --> 01:21:22,348
in retaliation
for your little stunt?

1433
01:21:22,448 --> 01:21:24,348
They can't do that
anymore, right, Barnes?

1434
01:21:24,448 --> 01:21:26,349
Besides, if I
grabbed Esperanza,

1435
01:21:26,449 --> 01:21:27,709
this would
all be over by now.

1436
01:21:27,819 --> 01:21:29,339
Well, maybe they're just
a little bit more creative

1437
01:21:29,459 --> 01:21:30,439
than you think!

1438
01:21:30,559 --> 01:21:32,819
Well, at least
I'm thinking, goddamn it!

1439
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:34,359
Listen, you wise-ass,

1440
01:21:34,459 --> 01:21:35,519
we're here to jerk off
that cocksucker

1441
01:21:35,629 --> 01:21:36,649
until he tries
to take off.

1442
01:21:36,759 --> 01:21:37,659
Period!

1443
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,359
Now, you're the wrong guy

1444
01:21:39,469 --> 01:21:40,859
in the wrong place
at the wrong time!

1445
01:21:42,969 --> 01:21:44,769
The story of my life.

1446
01:21:45,939 --> 01:21:46,909
Major,

1447
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:48,410
Pentagon situation room,
sir!

1448
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:49,410
Pentagon.

1449
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:51,410
I'll take it
in here.

1450
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:52,570
Thank you, Telford.

1451
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,410
You men
come with me.

1452
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:57,880
McClane.

1453
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:58,880
Yeah, Barnes.

1454
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:00,380
You said those guys

1455
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:01,850
showed up out there
right away?

1456
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:03,050
Yeah.

1457
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,920
That means they're
on the field or close,

1458
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:07,420
and I think
I know where.

1459
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:09,461
Come here. Let me
show you something.

1460
01:22:11,031 --> 01:22:12,431
These are the old plans

1461
01:22:12,531 --> 01:22:14,431
when the longer
runways went in.

1462
01:22:14,531 --> 01:22:15,901
That's 12 years ago.

1463
01:22:16,001 --> 01:22:18,441
Looks like they've done
some modifications on site--

1464
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:20,441
moved Tra Con phones, I LS,

1465
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:21,941
all the underground stuff

1466
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:23,941
so they could
handle drainage.

1467
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:25,441
If I'm right,

1468
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:27,941
all of it would run
right along the airport property

1469
01:22:28,051 --> 01:22:31,141
and go right past
this neighborhood.

1470
01:22:33,952 --> 01:22:35,942
We should have been
on the ground two hours ago!

1471
01:22:36,062 --> 01:22:38,962
I understand,
but if you just relax...

1472
01:22:39,062 --> 01:22:40,962
It's hopeless.

1473
01:22:41,062 --> 01:22:42,962
Somebody ought to get
their ass kicked for this mess,

1474
01:22:43,062 --> 01:22:45,262
that's for sure.

1475
01:22:45,362 --> 01:22:46,592
Well, unfortunately,

1476
01:22:46,702 --> 01:22:48,962
there really isn't anyone
we can blame for the weather.

1477
01:22:49,072 --> 01:22:51,972
Oh, yeah? What about
that porker Willard Scott?

1478
01:22:52,072 --> 01:22:53,973
I should have
taken the bus.

1479
01:22:54,073 --> 01:22:56,973
At least they can pull over
for food and gas.

1480
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:58,173
Excuse me.

1481
01:22:58,283 --> 01:23:00,143
Yes?

1482
01:23:00,253 --> 01:23:01,653
I was just wondering.

1483
01:23:01,753 --> 01:23:03,153
This flight originally

1484
01:23:03,253 --> 01:23:06,483
was supposed to be
51/2 hours, right?

1485
01:23:06,593 --> 01:23:07,483
Mm-hmm.

1486
01:23:07,593 --> 01:23:08,753
Do we have
enough fuel

1487
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:09,983
to keep circling
like this?

1488
01:23:10,093 --> 01:23:11,323
Oh, of course.

1489
01:23:11,423 --> 01:23:14,453
They anticipate
little problems like this.

1490
01:23:31,384 --> 01:23:33,214
Barnes, we looked
at 12 fucking houses,

1491
01:23:33,314 --> 01:23:34,644
and we're nowhere.

1492
01:23:34,754 --> 01:23:37,554
This is
our last possibility.

1493
01:23:37,654 --> 01:23:39,715
Over here there's
an old church.

1494
01:23:39,825 --> 01:23:41,455
Let's go.

1495
01:23:45,565 --> 01:23:47,055
Wait.

1496
01:23:54,075 --> 01:23:56,565
There's the church
over there.

1497
01:24:04,116 --> 01:24:06,206
Could be a sentry.

1498
01:24:06,316 --> 01:24:07,946
And he could just be
out for a walk.

1499
01:24:08,056 --> 01:24:10,526
Then why is he going over
his own footsteps?

1500
01:24:13,126 --> 01:24:14,146
Come on.

1501
01:24:16,396 --> 01:24:17,526
All right.

1502
01:24:17,626 --> 01:24:20,356
Just stay here and get ready
to call the marines.

1503
01:24:20,466 --> 01:24:22,096
I thought
they were the army.

1504
01:24:22,196 --> 01:24:24,757
Who gives a fuck?
Just be ready.

1505
01:24:41,817 --> 01:24:43,117
Oh, shit.

1506
01:24:43,227 --> 01:24:45,318
Not now.

1507
01:24:47,058 --> 01:24:49,118
Aah!

1508
01:24:59,538 --> 01:25:00,978
Lorenzo, it's Barnes.

1509
01:25:01,078 --> 01:25:02,978
Barnes, where the hell
did you go?

1510
01:25:03,078 --> 01:25:03,978
Where's McClane?

1511
01:25:04,078 --> 01:25:05,008
He's with me.

1512
01:25:05,108 --> 01:25:06,208
We're at the Hidey Lake
Community Church

1513
01:25:06,318 --> 01:25:07,249
on the west side
of the airport.

1514
01:25:07,349 --> 01:25:08,979
You're where?
Goddamn it!

1515
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:10,479
You crazy idiot,
why didn't--

1516
01:25:10,589 --> 01:25:11,989
This must be their
base of operations.

1517
01:25:12,089 --> 01:25:13,489
Shut up and get
your ass over here!

1518
01:25:13,589 --> 01:25:14,489
Move it!

1519
01:25:14,589 --> 01:25:15,989
Code red! Sit rep.

1520
01:25:16,089 --> 01:25:18,419
We got positive I.D.
on Stuart's location.

1521
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:19,429
Let's move.

1522
01:25:19,529 --> 01:25:21,389
Yo!

1523
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:32,770
Our escape plane
will be ready

1524
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,440
within 30 minutes,
General.

1525
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:38,310
If there are
no more surprises.

1526
01:25:53,461 --> 01:25:55,931
Gentlemen, we have
a situation here.

1527
01:26:43,483 --> 01:26:46,043
Aah!

1528
01:26:55,623 --> 01:26:56,613
Oh!

1529
01:27:14,184 --> 01:27:15,374
Over here.

1530
01:27:27,525 --> 01:27:30,255
Jeez, McClane, you all right?
You want a medic?

1531
01:27:30,365 --> 01:27:32,195
What the hell you think
you're doing out there,

1532
01:27:32,295 --> 01:27:33,765
playing John Wayne?

1533
01:27:33,865 --> 01:27:35,995
How would you like
to spend the night in a cell?

1534
01:27:36,105 --> 01:27:38,295
Lorenzo, shut the fuck up
and do something useful.

1535
01:27:38,405 --> 01:27:39,595
Go seal off the street.

1536
01:27:39,705 --> 01:27:41,765
Hey, you can't
talk to me like that.

1537
01:27:41,875 --> 01:27:43,176
Oh, no, Carmine?

1538
01:27:43,276 --> 01:27:45,106
Sergeant, get this bureaucrat

1539
01:27:45,216 --> 01:27:46,976
out of Mr. McClane's
face now.

1540
01:27:47,086 --> 01:27:48,946
With pleasure, sir.

1541
01:27:50,716 --> 01:27:52,776
Major...

1542
01:27:52,886 --> 01:27:54,116
the men are
in position, sir.

1543
01:27:54,226 --> 01:27:56,126
Close up the back.
Then we go in.

1544
01:27:56,226 --> 01:27:57,626
Fire only on my order.

1545
01:27:57,726 --> 01:27:59,126
Roger that, sir.

1546
01:27:59,226 --> 01:28:01,096
Guess I was
wrong about you.

1547
01:28:01,196 --> 01:28:03,666
You're not such
an asshole after all.

1548
01:28:03,766 --> 01:28:05,167
No, you were right.

1549
01:28:05,267 --> 01:28:07,237
I'm just your kind
of asshole.

1550
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:18,377
Garber, sit rep!

1551
01:28:18,477 --> 01:28:20,677
Army Special Forces
on three sides,

1552
01:28:20,787 --> 01:28:22,337
closing in fast
around the back!

1553
01:28:22,447 --> 01:28:23,787
Another problem,
Colonel?

1554
01:28:23,887 --> 01:28:25,877
No problem, General.

1555
01:28:25,987 --> 01:28:28,978
Gentlemen,
you know what to do.

1556
01:28:39,738 --> 01:28:40,638
Down!

1557
01:28:40,738 --> 01:28:42,068
Get down! Get down!

1558
01:29:10,039 --> 01:29:13,700
General...it's time.

1559
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:22,970
Come on, let's move it!

1560
01:29:37,031 --> 01:29:40,091
They're pulling out
out the back!

1561
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:48,931
Move it!

1562
01:29:59,492 --> 01:30:01,982
Albertson, take your men
around the back.

1563
01:30:08,692 --> 01:30:10,662
Aah!

1564
01:30:15,172 --> 01:30:17,763
Aah!

1565
01:30:27,453 --> 01:30:30,113
This equipment,
it could land our planes.

1566
01:30:30,223 --> 01:30:32,913
There were trip wires outside.
They could have booby-trapped--

1567
01:30:33,023 --> 01:30:33,923
They did.

1568
01:30:34,023 --> 01:30:34,993
Got one here, too.

1569
01:30:35,093 --> 01:30:36,653
Looks like C-4.
The motherfucker is armed.

1570
01:30:36,763 --> 01:30:40,054
Clear the area!
Everybody, now!

1571
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:44,594
They booby-trapped
all the equipment.

1572
01:30:44,704 --> 01:30:46,104
Seal off
the building!

1573
01:30:46,204 --> 01:30:47,604
Shit!

1574
01:30:47,704 --> 01:30:49,604
Post sentries.
No civilians allowed.

1575
01:30:49,704 --> 01:30:53,034
Hey, where the fuck
is McClane?

1576
01:31:41,956 --> 01:31:43,426
Miller, take him!

1577
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:48,027
I'll cover you!

1578
01:32:22,668 --> 01:32:27,668
Aah!

1579
01:32:33,749 --> 01:32:37,049
So much
for the element of chance.

1580
01:32:37,149 --> 01:32:38,619
Let's move out.

1581
01:32:46,189 --> 01:32:48,249
Ohh...

1582
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:58,160
I had the bastard
in my sights.

1583
01:32:58,270 --> 01:33:00,260
I know I did.

1584
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:11,690
Oh,Jesus Christ.

1585
01:33:16,861 --> 01:33:19,121
Attention, Tower.
Attention, Dulles Tower.

1586
01:33:19,231 --> 01:33:22,131
This is Colonel Stuart.
Is our plane prepared?

1587
01:33:22,231 --> 01:33:24,131
It is.
It's in hangar 11.

1588
01:33:24,231 --> 01:33:26,431
It's the most
remote building we've got.

1589
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:29,531
We're on our way.

1590
01:33:29,641 --> 01:33:31,611
Have a ground crew there
to confirm the condition

1591
01:33:31,711 --> 01:33:33,141
of the plane.

1592
01:33:33,241 --> 01:33:36,111
Do you believe the balls
on this son of a bitch?

1593
01:33:36,211 --> 01:33:38,942
Colonel, you're quite capable of
confirming it yourself.

1594
01:33:39,052 --> 01:33:40,952
Now, please, don't ask us

1595
01:33:41,052 --> 01:33:43,142
to gift-wrap potential
hostages for you.

1596
01:33:43,252 --> 01:33:44,652
Major Grant,
isn't it?

1597
01:33:44,752 --> 01:33:46,382
If you remember me,
Colonel,

1598
01:33:46,492 --> 01:33:50,022
then you remember I know
the drill as well as you do.

1599
01:33:50,132 --> 01:33:52,152
Check out
your own fucking plane.

1600
01:33:52,262 --> 01:33:54,662
We move out
in five minutes.

1601
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:56,162
Flak jackets
for everybody.

1602
01:33:56,262 --> 01:33:58,662
Body armor for
the assault team.

1603
01:33:58,772 --> 01:34:00,173
Night scopes
for the snipers.

1604
01:34:00,273 --> 01:34:02,173
We will take them
in the hangar,

1605
01:34:02,273 --> 01:34:04,173
and I will
pull that detonator

1606
01:34:04,273 --> 01:34:07,173
out of Stuart's
dead fucking hand myself.

1607
01:34:07,283 --> 01:34:10,643
Take all your men
back to the airport.

1608
01:34:10,753 --> 01:34:12,153
Seal off every exit

1609
01:34:12,253 --> 01:34:13,683
in case they try
to slip past us

1610
01:34:13,783 --> 01:34:15,683
to break out
onto the ground.

1611
01:34:15,783 --> 01:34:17,153
You got it.

1612
01:34:19,193 --> 01:34:20,983
All right,
here we go.

1613
01:34:21,093 --> 01:34:22,284
Dick, this is nuts.

1614
01:34:22,394 --> 01:34:23,624
Every station in town
has people out at the airport,

1615
01:34:23,734 --> 01:34:25,124
and none of them has
heard even a whisper

1616
01:34:25,234 --> 01:34:26,634
of this shit
you're running now!

1617
01:34:26,734 --> 01:34:28,564
Well,
none of them is me.

1618
01:34:28,664 --> 01:34:30,324
You want proof,
try this.

1619
01:34:30,434 --> 01:34:33,834
Repeat. Terrorists
have murdered civilians

1620
01:34:33,944 --> 01:34:36,934
and cut off the two systems
that can allow you to land.

1621
01:34:37,044 --> 01:34:39,134
A special U.S. Army unit
is already here

1622
01:34:39,244 --> 01:34:40,504
and preparing
to take out the terrorists.

1623
01:34:40,614 --> 01:34:41,514
Jesus Christ.

1624
01:34:41,614 --> 01:34:43,645
I want you
to go live now.

1625
01:34:43,755 --> 01:34:45,715
Get me in from the files--
a publicity shot.

1626
01:34:45,815 --> 01:34:47,845
Connie's got one.
The maps--get one from weather.

1627
01:34:47,955 --> 01:34:49,145
We're on it.
We're cutting in five minutes!

1628
01:34:49,255 --> 01:34:50,655
Tell the affiliates
if they want in,

1629
01:34:50,755 --> 01:34:52,155
they got three minutes
to shout.

1630
01:34:52,255 --> 01:34:54,595
Let's do this.

1631
01:34:54,695 --> 01:34:57,185
Network, here I come.

1632
01:35:00,335 --> 01:35:01,305
Hey, Telford,

1633
01:35:01,405 --> 01:35:03,165
what was your
chicken shit outfit doing

1634
01:35:03,275 --> 01:35:04,795
while we
were taking Grenada?

1635
01:35:04,905 --> 01:35:06,706
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

1636
01:35:06,806 --> 01:35:09,206
Grenada-- five minutes
of fire fight,

1637
01:35:09,306 --> 01:35:12,006
five weeks of surfing.

1638
01:35:12,116 --> 01:35:14,086
I wish I was
with you guys for that.

1639
01:35:14,186 --> 01:35:16,176
Yeah. Me, too, kid.

1640
01:35:16,286 --> 01:35:17,616
Really, sir?

1641
01:35:17,716 --> 01:35:19,416
Sure.

1642
01:35:19,516 --> 01:35:22,186
Then we wouldn't
have to do this.

1643
01:35:37,577 --> 01:35:40,137
Eagle Nest,
this is Hatchling.

1644
01:35:40,247 --> 01:35:44,267
On schedule...
and in position.

1645
01:35:44,377 --> 01:35:46,647
Roger, Hatchling.
We are secure here.

1646
01:35:46,747 --> 01:35:48,647
You have
a green light.

1647
01:35:48,747 --> 01:35:52,478
I repeat, a green light.

1648
01:36:00,268 --> 01:36:01,698
Oh!

1649
01:36:03,268 --> 01:36:05,668
Jesus, Officer,
where did you come from,

1650
01:36:05,768 --> 01:36:07,168
Pearl Harbor?

1651
01:36:07,268 --> 01:36:08,758
Uh!

1652
01:36:11,308 --> 01:36:14,709
All right,
let's clear it out, please.

1653
01:36:15,809 --> 01:36:17,609
Stand by.

1654
01:36:17,719 --> 01:36:20,309
5, 4, 3...

1655
01:36:20,419 --> 01:36:24,009
This is a special bulletin
from WZDC News.

1656
01:36:24,119 --> 01:36:25,609
There was a plane crash
earlier this evening at Dulles,

1657
01:36:25,719 --> 01:36:27,689
where other aircraft
continue to circle,

1658
01:36:27,789 --> 01:36:30,689
with no explanation from
airport or FAA officials.

1659
01:36:30,799 --> 01:36:33,699
And now,
with an exclusive WZDC report,

1660
01:36:33,799 --> 01:36:37,630
here's Dick Thornberg reporting
from the skies over Washington.

1661
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:40,170
I'm one of the thousand people

1662
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:42,300
who has been circling
our nation's capital

1663
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:44,140
under the assumption
that whatever problem

1664
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:47,040
was going on far below
was a normal one,

1665
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:49,140
but the truth
is far from normal.

1666
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:51,370
The truth is terrifying.

1667
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:54,680
Look out!
Lady, look out!

1668
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:55,720
Look out! Look out!

1669
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:58,081
Look out! Look out!
Get out of the way!

1670
01:36:58,191 --> 01:36:59,161
Ho!

1671
01:36:59,261 --> 01:37:00,161
Get out of the way!

1672
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:02,351
Get out
of the way, lady!

1673
01:37:02,461 --> 01:37:04,161
Go, go, go!
Hey, hey, look out!

1674
01:37:04,261 --> 01:37:06,161
This is a recording
of a conversation

1675
01:37:06,261 --> 01:37:09,431
between Dulles Tower
and a captive aircraft overhead.

1676
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:13,761
Get out of the way!

1677
01:37:15,511 --> 01:37:16,671
Lorenzo!

1678
01:37:16,781 --> 01:37:18,111
McClane, are you out
of your fucking mind?

1679
01:37:18,211 --> 01:37:20,112
The Blue Light team--
where are they?

1680
01:37:20,212 --> 01:37:21,772
Stuart's got explosives
in the church rigged with a remote.

1681
01:37:21,882 --> 01:37:23,012
Where's Grant?

1682
01:37:23,112 --> 01:37:24,452
They're going to kill
that son of a bitch

1683
01:37:24,552 --> 01:37:25,612
and get it from them!

1684
01:37:25,722 --> 01:37:26,812
They're not
going to do that!

1685
01:37:26,922 --> 01:37:28,082
They're going to
get on the same plane with him

1686
01:37:28,192 --> 01:37:29,122
and take off
with him!

1687
01:37:29,222 --> 01:37:30,282
Get the fuck
out of here!

1688
01:37:30,392 --> 01:37:32,292
When the army
canned Stuart,

1689
01:37:32,392 --> 01:37:33,452
he loaded that unit
with his own men!

1690
01:37:33,562 --> 01:37:35,252
Are you nuts?
That fire fight--

1691
01:37:35,362 --> 01:37:36,792
Sideshow to buy
them some time.

1692
01:37:36,902 --> 01:37:40,232
McClane, you are
completely around the fucking bend.

1693
01:37:40,332 --> 01:37:41,703
You're under arrest,
you motherfucker.

1694
01:37:48,173 --> 01:37:49,643
Here! These
are the bullets

1695
01:37:49,743 --> 01:37:51,073
they used
out there tonight!

1696
01:37:51,183 --> 01:37:53,243
Blanks!

1697
01:37:54,753 --> 01:37:57,243
Jesus Christ.

1698
01:38:04,264 --> 01:38:06,884
This is Chief Lorenzo.

1699
01:38:06,994 --> 01:38:08,154
I want
every officer recalled

1700
01:38:08,264 --> 01:38:10,164
and assembled in body armor
and full weaponry

1701
01:38:10,264 --> 01:38:12,424
in the motor pool
in five minutes.

1702
01:38:13,734 --> 01:38:17,434
It's time to kick ass.

1703
01:38:19,274 --> 01:38:21,644
Just like IwoJima!

1704
01:38:21,744 --> 01:38:24,944
This reporter has learned
that the terrorists

1705
01:38:25,044 --> 01:38:27,015
have virtual control
of the entire airport,

1706
01:38:27,115 --> 01:38:30,175
a fact that the authorities
have repressed.

1707
01:38:30,285 --> 01:38:32,185
The terrorists
promise more bloodshed

1708
01:38:32,285 --> 01:38:34,485
unless their demands
are met,

1709
01:38:34,595 --> 01:38:36,615
and now that
the Special Army commandos

1710
01:38:36,725 --> 01:38:38,125
have arrived at the airport,

1711
01:38:38,225 --> 01:38:40,125
the likelihood
of a full-scale, deadly battle

1712
01:38:40,235 --> 01:38:42,755
is dangerously close.

1713
01:39:03,016 --> 01:39:06,146
That stupid, arrogant
son of a bitch.

1714
01:39:06,256 --> 01:39:09,056
It's all over the airport.

1715
01:39:09,156 --> 01:39:11,057
300 people have died...

1716
01:39:11,167 --> 01:39:13,567
When are we
going to land?

1717
01:39:13,667 --> 01:39:16,157
...and unfortunately
they may not be the last.

1718
01:39:16,267 --> 01:39:18,827
The horrifying fact
is that no one is safe,

1719
01:39:18,937 --> 01:39:21,097
either in the planes
above Dulles

1720
01:39:21,207 --> 01:39:23,607
or in the terminal below.

1721
01:39:23,707 --> 01:39:27,107
The threat of a new and higher
body count at the airport

1722
01:39:27,217 --> 01:39:29,117
hangs over the heads
of everyone,

1723
01:39:29,217 --> 01:39:31,117
and the holiday season
of peace and love

1724
01:39:31,217 --> 01:39:33,588
has become a nightmare.

1725
01:39:39,588 --> 01:39:40,988
All right, listen up!

1726
01:39:41,098 --> 01:39:44,118
All units, I want you
to converge on hangar 11,

1727
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:45,628
all sides!

1728
01:39:45,728 --> 01:39:47,628
This car, McClane!
Get in!

1729
01:39:47,738 --> 01:39:50,498
When the City Blue
show up with their backup,

1730
01:39:50,608 --> 01:39:52,128
they'll pick up
the pieces!

1731
01:39:52,238 --> 01:39:54,068
Now, move out!

1732
01:39:54,179 --> 01:39:58,109
McClane, say hi
to my brother Vito.

1733
01:39:58,209 --> 01:39:59,769
Merry Christmas.

1734
01:39:59,879 --> 01:40:01,409
Hi.

1735
01:40:07,919 --> 01:40:09,149
Goddamn it
to hell!

1736
01:40:09,259 --> 01:40:11,889
Move that
piece of shit!

1737
01:40:11,989 --> 01:40:15,019
Will you move
that goddamn piece of shit

1738
01:40:15,129 --> 01:40:16,149
out of here?

1739
01:40:16,259 --> 01:40:17,600
Vito, get the fuck
out of the car

1740
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:20,600
and get your ass
in gear and help me.

1741
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:22,000
Will you get--

1742
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:24,540
Move that car
right now!

1743
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:25,770
Right there.
Right there. Get that.

1744
01:40:25,870 --> 01:40:27,870
Hey, Coleman!

1745
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:32,040
Sam! Sam Coleman!

1746
01:40:32,150 --> 01:40:34,380
Hey, Coleman!

1747
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:35,780
Hi!

1748
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,320
Coleman!

1749
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:42,121
But at least the truth
is not among the hostages

1750
01:40:42,221 --> 01:40:45,621
because I, Richard Thornberg,
just happened to be here

1751
01:40:45,731 --> 01:40:49,931
to put his life
and talent

1752
01:40:50,031 --> 01:40:52,901
on the line for humanity
and country,

1753
01:40:53,001 --> 01:40:55,971
and if this should be
my final broadcast--

1754
01:40:58,241 --> 01:41:01,212
Amen to that...Dick.

1755
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:04,142
Dick? We're live, Dick.

1756
01:41:04,252 --> 01:41:06,302
Where are you now?

1757
01:41:06,412 --> 01:41:08,782
Dick?

1758
01:41:08,882 --> 01:41:10,712
Truck lights
approaching, sir.

1759
01:41:10,822 --> 01:41:14,152
They're here,
right on schedule.

1760
01:41:14,262 --> 01:41:16,662
The hangar door,
open it.

1761
01:41:16,762 --> 01:41:18,092
Clockwork.

1762
01:41:41,223 --> 01:41:41,623
Jeez, you
give me this story,

1763
01:41:41,623 --> 01:41:42,613
Jeez, you
give me this story,

1764
01:41:42,723 --> 01:41:45,124
and I'll
have your baby.

1765
01:41:45,224 --> 01:41:48,054
Not the kind of ride
I'm looking for.

1766
01:41:59,734 --> 01:42:03,144
Colonel, if I may say so,
you are some piece of work.

1767
01:42:03,244 --> 01:42:04,644
Thank you, Major.

1768
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:06,644
You're not
so bad yourself.

1769
01:42:06,744 --> 01:42:08,475
Congratulations
on your escape, sir.

1770
01:42:08,585 --> 01:42:09,635
Thank you, Major.

1771
01:42:09,745 --> 01:42:10,905
Maybe you
should save them

1772
01:42:11,015 --> 01:42:12,075
until we
are all safe, hmm?

1773
01:42:12,185 --> 01:42:13,755
Sir.

1774
01:42:13,755 --> 01:42:15,655
My congratulations,
gentlemen.

1775
01:42:15,755 --> 01:42:17,155
You've won a victory
for our way of life,

1776
01:42:17,255 --> 01:42:21,525
my pride, my admiration,
and a kick-ass vacation.

1777
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:23,255
Now, get on board.

1778
01:42:52,327 --> 01:42:54,227
What's the matter,
cowboy, ride too rough?

1779
01:42:54,327 --> 01:42:55,727
I don't
like to fly.

1780
01:42:55,827 --> 01:42:57,227
Then what
are you doing here?

1781
01:42:57,337 --> 01:42:59,027
I don't like
to lose, either.

1782
01:42:59,137 --> 01:43:01,567
O.K. Whoo! Here we go!

1783
01:43:09,507 --> 01:43:11,447
I don't know
about you guys,

1784
01:43:11,547 --> 01:43:13,407
but I've seen
enough fucking snow

1785
01:43:13,517 --> 01:43:14,608
to last me
a lifetime.

1786
01:43:14,718 --> 01:43:16,738
You don't get much of that
in the tropics, Major.

1787
01:43:16,848 --> 01:43:19,548
For you, gentlemen,
we'll import it.

1788
01:43:22,588 --> 01:43:24,058
Shit!
They left the hangar!

1789
01:43:27,028 --> 01:43:28,458
Right there.

1790
01:43:28,568 --> 01:43:30,398
Right there.
Get that.

1791
01:43:30,498 --> 01:43:31,398
All right, now what?

1792
01:43:31,498 --> 01:43:32,698
Get in front of them!
Take it down!

1793
01:43:32,798 --> 01:43:34,898
Block their path
so they can't get out of there!

1794
01:43:35,008 --> 01:43:36,499
I'm not playing chicken
with a 200-ton plane!

1795
01:43:36,609 --> 01:43:37,869
I'm crazy, man,
but I ain't that crazy.

1796
01:43:37,979 --> 01:43:39,029
Forget it.

1797
01:43:39,139 --> 01:43:40,699
Dulles,
this is Northeast 140.

1798
01:43:40,809 --> 01:43:42,039
Request clearance
on first available runway.

1799
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:43,239
That's Holly's plane.

1800
01:43:43,349 --> 01:43:45,749
Repeat. Request
emergency clearance.

1801
01:43:45,849 --> 01:43:46,869
I know you're
not going to answer me,

1802
01:43:46,989 --> 01:43:48,109
but you damn well
better listen!

1803
01:43:48,219 --> 01:43:50,209
We're down to fumes,
and we have to land,

1804
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:51,549
and in five minutes
we're coming in

1805
01:43:51,659 --> 01:43:53,059
one way or another.

1806
01:43:53,159 --> 01:43:54,389
That's my wife's
plane!

1807
01:43:54,489 --> 01:43:55,789
Take it
fucking down!

1808
01:43:55,889 --> 01:43:57,329
I'm not getting
in front of that plane!

1809
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:04,820
All right, how about
getting over top of it?

1810
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:06,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain.

1811
01:44:06,570 --> 01:44:07,540
Your attention.

1812
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:08,730
We have no choice

1813
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:11,070
but to attempt
an emergency landing.

1814
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:13,580
Please fasten your seat belts
and assume crash positions

1815
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:16,080
as instructed
by your cabin attendants.

1816
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:18,580
Let's have
the emergency check list.

1817
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:21,121
Attention all air traffic
in Dulles area.

1818
01:44:21,221 --> 01:44:22,621
This is Northeast 140.

1819
01:44:22,721 --> 01:44:24,241
We're going to attempt
an emergency landing.

1820
01:44:24,361 --> 01:44:25,481
Be advised.

1821
01:44:28,361 --> 01:44:29,761
I don't want to die.

1822
01:44:29,861 --> 01:44:31,691
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

1823
01:44:31,801 --> 01:44:33,201
Just buckle
your seat belt.

1824
01:44:33,301 --> 01:44:35,201
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1825
01:44:35,301 --> 01:44:36,431
Lean forward.

1826
01:44:37,801 --> 01:44:39,931
God!

1827
01:44:40,041 --> 01:44:42,011
Oh!

1828
01:44:44,882 --> 01:44:46,812
Oh, God.

1829
01:44:46,912 --> 01:44:48,212
O God,

1830
01:44:48,312 --> 01:44:52,112
Thy rod and Thy staff
they comfort me.

1831
01:44:58,292 --> 01:44:59,882
Just hang on!

1832
01:44:59,992 --> 01:45:01,862
What are you doing?

1833
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:02,932
You wanted a story,
didn't you?

1834
01:45:03,032 --> 01:45:04,022
Nice and easy, boys.

1835
01:45:04,132 --> 01:45:05,223
Get me in low!

1836
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:06,853
You got it!

1837
01:45:08,773 --> 01:45:10,733
Bring me down!

1838
01:45:10,843 --> 01:45:12,233
You'll get
yourself killed!

1839
01:45:12,343 --> 01:45:14,803
Come back inside!

1840
01:45:21,183 --> 01:45:23,243
Bring it in low!
Keep over the wing!

1841
01:45:30,794 --> 01:45:33,224
Lower!

1842
01:45:33,324 --> 01:45:34,224
Aah!

1843
01:45:42,834 --> 01:45:45,434
John, what the fuck
are you doing

1844
01:45:45,544 --> 01:45:48,514
out on the wing
of this plane?

1845
01:45:53,485 --> 01:45:54,745
Damn!

1846
01:46:00,525 --> 01:46:02,115
Mierda.

1847
01:46:02,225 --> 01:46:03,595
There's
something wrong.

1848
01:46:03,695 --> 01:46:06,385
The ailerons.

1849
01:46:06,495 --> 01:46:08,555
We can't
take off.

1850
01:46:11,536 --> 01:46:12,466
Hijo de puta.

1851
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:14,336
It's McClane again.

1852
01:46:16,076 --> 01:46:17,306
Son of a bitch!

1853
01:46:18,406 --> 01:46:21,246
I'll do him.

1854
01:46:21,346 --> 01:46:22,606
This time
do it right.

1855
01:46:22,716 --> 01:46:24,616
You just get us
in the air, General.

1856
01:46:24,716 --> 01:46:26,276
You're the only man
who can do it.

1857
01:46:26,386 --> 01:46:28,176
Don't shoot.
That wing is fully fueled.

1858
01:46:54,277 --> 01:46:55,177
Ya!

1859
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:23,499
Too bad, McClane.
I kind of liked you!

1860
01:47:27,579 --> 01:47:28,549
Whoa!

1861
01:47:31,289 --> 01:47:33,619
I got enough friends!

1862
01:47:36,389 --> 01:47:37,909
Aah!

1863
01:48:10,521 --> 01:48:12,251
O.K., McClane...

1864
01:48:12,361 --> 01:48:13,851
time for
the main event!

1865
01:48:18,871 --> 01:48:20,601
Aah!

1866
01:48:22,971 --> 01:48:23,871
Aah!

1867
01:48:49,733 --> 01:48:51,603
Motherfucker!

1868
01:48:59,413 --> 01:49:00,703
Oh!

1869
01:49:02,183 --> 01:49:03,373
Ha ha ha!

1870
01:49:03,483 --> 01:49:04,443
How's it going?

1871
01:49:08,323 --> 01:49:09,874
Bon voyage!

1872
01:49:16,324 --> 01:49:19,354
Happy landings, asshole!

1873
01:50:09,786 --> 01:50:12,186
Yippie-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

1874
01:50:25,067 --> 01:50:26,727
Yeah. All right.

1875
01:50:41,218 --> 01:50:42,448
Aah!

1876
01:50:46,088 --> 01:50:48,678
Whoa!

1877
01:50:54,268 --> 01:50:57,198
Ha ha ha!

1878
01:50:57,298 --> 01:51:00,169
Oh!

1879
01:51:03,809 --> 01:51:06,709
Holly!

1880
01:51:06,809 --> 01:51:09,209
Here's your fucking
landing light!

1881
01:51:09,309 --> 01:51:10,869
Whoo!

1882
01:51:17,049 --> 01:51:18,719
Oh, God.

1883
01:51:20,959 --> 01:51:22,430
Look!

1884
01:51:22,530 --> 01:51:23,420
Look!

1885
01:51:23,530 --> 01:51:26,720
O.K., I see it!
I see it!

1886
01:51:50,691 --> 01:51:52,181
They used
the fire to see!

1887
01:51:52,291 --> 01:51:53,621
They used
the fucking fire to see!

1888
01:51:53,721 --> 01:51:54,951
They can all do that.
Tell them.

1889
01:51:55,061 --> 01:51:56,461
They already know.

1890
01:51:56,561 --> 01:51:58,191
We had a visual
on Northeastern's landing.

1891
01:51:58,301 --> 01:51:59,521
Listen.

1892
01:51:59,631 --> 01:52:01,661
We're following the fire trail
in as a guide.

1893
01:52:01,771 --> 01:52:02,991
If they can do it,
so can we!

1894
01:52:20,352 --> 01:52:21,722
Whoo!

1895
01:52:21,822 --> 01:52:23,222
If any landing
you can walk away from

1896
01:52:23,322 --> 01:52:24,652
is a good one,
that's great.

1897
01:52:24,762 --> 01:52:26,282
Whew!

1898
01:52:48,353 --> 01:52:50,253
Oh!

1899
01:52:54,554 --> 01:52:56,254
Jump!

1900
01:52:56,354 --> 01:52:57,754
Jump!

1901
01:52:57,864 --> 01:52:59,254
I got you!

1902
01:52:59,364 --> 01:53:00,414
Jump!

1903
01:53:29,295 --> 01:53:30,885
There you go.
That's it.

1904
01:53:30,995 --> 01:53:33,515
There he is!

1905
01:53:33,695 --> 01:53:34,825
That's it!

1906
01:53:36,336 --> 01:53:39,736
Holly!

1907
01:53:42,836 --> 01:53:46,176
Holly!

1908
01:53:46,276 --> 01:53:48,336
Holly!

1909
01:53:50,846 --> 01:53:54,046
Holly!

1910
01:53:56,286 --> 01:53:59,817
Holly!

1911
01:54:01,357 --> 01:54:04,817
Holly!

1912
01:54:08,367 --> 01:54:12,197
Holly!

1913
01:54:14,067 --> 01:54:16,167
Holly!

1914
01:54:18,877 --> 01:54:22,078
Come on!
We got you!

1915
01:54:22,178 --> 01:54:26,278
Oh! Oh!

1916
01:54:26,388 --> 01:54:29,318
Oh, God.
Oh, baby.

1917
01:54:29,418 --> 01:54:31,718
I thought I was never going
to see you again.

1918
01:54:31,828 --> 01:54:34,158
That's what
I thought about you.

1919
01:54:34,258 --> 01:54:36,918
I love you so much.

1920
01:54:39,598 --> 01:54:42,499
They told me there were
terrorists at the airport.

1921
01:54:42,599 --> 01:54:45,829
Yeah. I heard that, too.

1922
01:54:53,609 --> 01:54:55,239
God, that's beautiful.

1923
01:54:55,349 --> 01:54:57,249
Yeah.

1924
01:54:58,349 --> 01:55:02,149
Yup, it sure is.

1925
01:55:02,259 --> 01:55:05,190
Oh, I love you so much.

1926
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:09,190
Oh,John.

1927
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,920
Why does this
keep happening to us?

1928
01:55:17,370 --> 01:55:20,030
Let's go home.

1929
01:55:20,140 --> 01:55:22,340
Get in the truck!

1930
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:24,270
Let's get her
out of here!

1931
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:26,941
Somebody help me,
please!

1932
01:55:27,051 --> 01:55:28,911
Oh, honey, help me
up here, please.

1933
01:55:29,021 --> 01:55:30,511
Asshole!

1934
01:55:34,121 --> 01:55:36,211
Hey, Officer!
Hey, come on!

1935
01:55:36,321 --> 01:55:37,721
Hey, hey!

1936
01:55:37,831 --> 01:55:40,731
Hop on in here!
Get your missus in!

1937
01:55:40,831 --> 01:55:42,691
What do you say, Marv?

1938
01:55:42,801 --> 01:55:46,561
I'll be damned if I'm going
to clean up this mess!

1939
01:55:46,671 --> 01:55:48,232
Ha ha ha!

1940
01:55:53,842 --> 01:55:56,872
Hey, McClane!

1941
01:55:56,982 --> 01:55:58,742
You get this
parking ticket

1942
01:55:58,852 --> 01:56:00,142
in front
of my airport?

1943
01:56:00,252 --> 01:56:03,182
Yeah.

1944
01:56:03,282 --> 01:56:07,012
Ah, what the hell.
It's Christmas!

1945
01:56:10,363 --> 01:56:12,123
# Oh, the weather outside
is frightful #

1946
01:56:12,233 --> 01:56:13,253
Take off, Marv!

1947
01:56:13,363 --> 01:56:17,323
# But the fire
is so delightful #

1948
01:56:17,433 --> 01:56:21,423
# And since we've
no place to go #

1949
01:56:21,543 --> 01:56:25,443
# Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow #

1950
01:56:25,543 --> 01:56:29,033
# It doesn't show signs
of stopping #

1951
01:56:29,143 --> 01:56:32,814
# And I brought some corn
for popping #

1952
01:56:32,914 --> 01:56:36,474
# The lights are turned
way down low #

1953
01:56:36,584 --> 01:56:40,214
# Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow #

1954
01:56:40,324 --> 01:56:44,054
# When we finally
kiss good night #

1955
01:56:44,164 --> 01:56:47,864
# How I hate
going out in the storm #

1956
01:56:47,964 --> 01:56:52,094
# But if you'll
really hold me tight #

1957
01:56:52,204 --> 01:56:55,765
# All the way home
I'll be warm #

1958
01:56:55,875 --> 01:56:59,245
# The fire is slowly dying #

1959
01:56:59,345 --> 01:57:02,975
# And, my dear,
we're still good-byeing #

1960
01:57:03,085 --> 01:57:06,775
# But as long
as you love me so #

1961
01:57:06,885 --> 01:57:10,445
# Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow #
