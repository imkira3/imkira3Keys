1
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:48,007
"California, USA"

2
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:53,471
It's a villain!

3
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,889
Run away!

4
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,521
I'll take that ten million dollars!

5
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,066
This job's a piece of cake!

6
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:05,691
Bro!

7
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,235
Huh?

8
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,994
That's it, villains!

9
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,289
End it, Cow Lady!

10
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:23,876
Calm down...

11
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,754
Like I will!

12
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,094
Papa!

13
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,638
You're in the way! Move!

14
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:52,196
It's fine now. Why?

15
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,702
Because I am here!

16
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,498
Hey man, who the hell are you?

17
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:07,628
Just a hero from Japan who happened to pass by.

18
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:10,006
Then I'll send you back home!

19
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,383
In a coffin!

20
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,643
Who said he was going to send me back--

21
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,353
Huh?

22
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,564
You're so fast at running away!

23
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,651
You went too far ahead, Toshi!

24
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:33,195
He got away!

25
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,572
Follow him, Dave!

26
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,409
Your body moves before you think, as usual!

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,092
Bro, a car's following us!

28
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,345
Damn heroes!

29
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:06,771
What the hell?

30
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,983
Toshi, we're going to be late for the lecture.

31
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,234
Hurry up and finish this!

32
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,779
That's the plan, Dave!

33
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,950
You just keep coming, huh?

34
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,078
Detroit...

35
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,705
...Smash!

36
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,599
I'll end it with this move--

37
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,353
Dave, the move named after your home state...

38
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,771
Go!

39
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,107
California...

40
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:56,362
...Smash!

41
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,421
Who's that hero?

42
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,672
I've never seen him.

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,882
But he's amazing!

44
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,136
He's an exchange student from Japan!

45
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:24,348
His hero name is All Might.

46
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:26,517
All Might...

47
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:31,439
He's the man who will someday...
someday soon...

48
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,692
...become the Symbol of Peace.

49
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,905
Thanks, Dave!

50
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:43,617
Thanks to the suit you made,
we can make it in time.

51
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:46,787
Let's hurry! If we're late again,
we won't have enough credits--

52
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,957
SFO flight UA 857 has been hijacked.

53
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,084
--SFO flight UA 857 has--
--Dave!

54
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,627
It's too reckless.

55
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:01,135
You can't not help them, huh?

56
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,679
Let's go, Dave!

57
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,306
Yeah!

58
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:09,685
It's really tough being a hero, though!

59
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:14,482
I'll buy you lunch today!

60
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:17,610
All Might.

61
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,363
All Might, All Might!

62
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,658
What's the matter, Young Midoriya?

63
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,828
We can see it. Look!

64
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:34,293
The artificial moving city inhabited
by over 10,000 scientists, I-island.

65
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:38,297
It's like a dream come true to be able to go to
I-island right at the beginning of summer vacation!

66
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,966
I didn't think you'd be that excited.

67
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,594
I'm glad I invited you.

68
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,389
But is it really okay for me to come with you?

69
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,475
There's no need to hold back.

70
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,437
The invitation said I could bring a companion.

71
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:56,607
Isn't that usually meant for family--

72
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:02,071
We are connected by something
thicker than blood, aren't we?

73
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,157
The bond of One For All.

74
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,326
Yes!

75
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:11,747
This plane will soon
begin its descent to I-island.

76
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:15,125
Now, it's about to get pretty exhausting.

77
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:18,128
Because once I arrive, I...

78
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,258
...must maintain my muscle form constantly.

79
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,010
Now, Young Midoriya, you change, too.

80
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,889
You asked the school if you could
bring your hero costume, right?

81
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,599
Yes!

82
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,104
The world has become a superhuman society,

83
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:39,650
and about 80% of the world's population
now has some kind of special trait.

84
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,236
Fighting against villains
using their Quirks for evil

85
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,572
and saving people from distress,

86
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,200
professional heroes came into the limelight.

87
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,749
It's fine now. Why?

88
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,043
Because I am here.

89
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,421
He's so cool!

90
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,800
Once I get my Quirk, I wanna be like him, too!

91
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,844
You should probably give it up.

92
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:12,600
But I, lzuku Midoriya,
was born without any special trait,

93
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:16,895
and almost gave up
my dream of becoming a hero.

94
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:25,446
My life made an about-face on the fateful day
that I met the number one hero, All Might...

95
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:29,450
Even if I don't have a Quirk,
can I become a hero?

96
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:34,663
Can even someone without a Quirk be like you?

97
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:38,542
Top heroes have stories
about them from their school days.

98
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,254
Most of their stories have one thing in common:

99
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:46,342
Their bodies moved before
they had a chance to think.

100
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,426
Kacchan!

101
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,720
Why are you here?

102
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,476
You looked like you were asking for help...

103
00:07:56,852 --> 00:08:00,939
You can become a hero.

104
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,276
Young man, I will tell you the truth.

105
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:10,658
My Quirk was passed
on to me like a sacred torch.

106
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,951
The power to transfer power...

107
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,247
That is the Quirk I inherited!

108
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:21,418
It was crowned with the name "One For All"!

109
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:25,255
One For All...

110
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,800
One person cultivates the power

111
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:33,097
and passes it on to another person,
who also cultivates it and passes it on.

112
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:38,435
It is the crystallization of power that spins
together the voices of those who need help

113
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,312
with a courageous heart.

114
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:46,068
That's right. And next, it is your turn.

115
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:50,280
After I received All Might's Quirk, One For All,

116
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,866
I enrolled in U.A. High School's hero course

117
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,828
and started running again toward my dream,

118
00:08:56,036 --> 00:09:00,958
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

119
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,544
...in order to become the greatest hero!

120
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:07,881
"My Hero Academia: Two Heroes"

121
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,677
"I-island - Airport"

122
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,011
We will now begin the immigration inspection.

123
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,014
Here's a question for you, Young Midoriya.

124
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,684
Why was this artificial island created?

125
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,060
Let's see...

126
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:24,189
To create a place where the world's talents
could gather and research Quirks

127
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,983
and develop hero items!

128
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,821
This island was made mobile in order to protect
the scientists and their research from villains.

129
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,324
That security system is
the equivalent of Tartarus,

130
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,452
and no villain has committed
a crime here before.

131
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:39,538
"Mutter mutter mutter"

132
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:39,580
You really know a lot about this stuff, huh?

133
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,041
The immigration inspection is complete.

134
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,504
Currently, on I-island, we are
having the preopening of I-Expo,

135
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,758
an exposition showcasing the results
of various research and development.

136
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,094
If you received an invitation,
please come and take a look.

137
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:07,649
I can't believe so many people are here
even before they officially open to the public.

138
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,028
Seeing it in person,
you can really tell how amazing it is!

139
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:15,824
Unlike Japan, people are allowed
to use their Quirks as they wish on I-island.

140
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,244
Apparently, there are a lot of attractions
in the pavilions that use Quirks.

141
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,746
You should go visit them later.

142
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,789
Okay!

143
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,416
Now let's see... The hotel is...

144
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,335
Welcome to I-Expo!

145
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,296
Wait, All Might?!

146
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:30,506
All Might?!

147
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,424
The number one hero?!

148
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,091
It's really him!

149
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,093
Wow!

150
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,306
Thank you for such a warm welcome!

151
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,308
Line up for autographs!

152
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,357
I didn't think I'd be stopped for that long...

153
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,485
We were about to be late!

154
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,444
Late?

155
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:57,449
Yeah, I wanted to have a reunion with
an old friend that I haven't seen in a while.

156
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,952
Sorry, but would you mind coming with me?

157
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,162
All Might's friend...

158
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,122
Of course I'll go!

159
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:08,961
I haven't told him about One For All
or how I've passed the Quirk on to you,

160
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,128
so keep that in mind.

161
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,048
It's even a secret from your friend?

162
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:17,636
It's because danger follows around
those who know the secret of One For All.

163
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,388
I see.

164
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,265
That's true...

165
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:25,644
One For All is that important of a secret.

166
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:30,399
Young Midoriya, the one
who inherits One For All from me

167
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:36,864
bears the fate of one day
facing great evil and All For One.

168
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:37,948
That's right.

169
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,075
To be ready when that time comes,

170
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:44,705
I must learn to use One For All
properly as soon as I can.

171
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,796
Uncle!

172
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,632
Uncle Might!

173
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,718
Oh, Melissa!

174
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,386
Long time no see!

175
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,263
I'm so happy you came!

176
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,849
Thank you for inviting me!

177
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,018
But man, I almost didn't recognize you!

178
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,145
You're all grown up now!

179
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,980
I'm 17 now.

180
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,940
I'm heavier than I used to be, aren't I?

181
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,276
Not at all!

182
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,364
I'm glad you seem well, as usual, Uncle Might.

183
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,784
--She's All Might's old friend? --Sorry I'm late. I was
so focused on my experiment that I lost track of time...

184
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,328
--She doesn't seem to be the right age... --Sorry I'm late. I
was so focused on my experiment that I lost track of time...

185
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,413
"Could it be her Quirk?
--Don't worry about it.

186
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,625
Oh right, where's Dave?

187
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,335
He's in his lab.

188
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,254
It looks like he finished the first stage of some
research he'd been working on for many years,

189
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:39,092
so I invited you to this island
as a surprise to celebrate that.

190
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,345
Is that what it was?

191
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,306
By the way, what was
Dave researching this time?

192
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:48,143
He said it's confidential and won't tell even me.

193
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,437
Scientists have it hard, too, huh?

194
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:55,108
Oh, Young Midoriya,
she's my good friend's daughter...

195
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,735
I'm Melissa Shield.

196
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,737
Nice to meet you!

197
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,364
Is that how it is?

198
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,365
--Hm?
--Huh? What?

199
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,284
Oh, nothing!

200
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,411
N-Nice to meet you!

201
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,582
I'm lzuku Midoriya, a first year in
the hero course at U.A. High School.

202
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,002
U.A. High School? Then you're Uncle Might's...

203
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,587
Yes, I'm his student!

204
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,048
He's going to be a hero in the future!

205
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,343
Wow, I can't believe
you're Uncle Might's student!

206
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,178
You've got a promising future, huh?

207
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:26,974
No, I'm still in training, I mean, I'm...

208
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,517
What kind of Quirk do you have?

209
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,644
A p-power type!

210
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,648
It's cool, but it's a very orthodox design...

211
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,067
I don't see any support items, either...

212
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,528
S-So close!

213
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,700
Maybe you should refine your costume...

214
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:46,910
Melissa, it's about time.

215
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:51,206
Oh, I'm sorry! I got distracted...

216
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:55,127
We've gotta hurry up and make Papa happy!

217
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,171
This way, Uncle Might!

218
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,724
We were able to get into
the expo with no problem.

219
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,101
So when will the goods arrive?

220
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,396
Please come get it at 3 p.m. at gate 66.

221
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,023
I understand.

222
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,536
Professor.

223
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,288
Professor David.

224
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,958
I've finished cleaning up here, too.

225
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,419
Really? Thanks, Sam.

226
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:41,923
Why don't you go have lunch
with your daughter sometime?

227
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,259
She went to the Academy today, too.

228
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,803
I thought they had a break for I-Expo?

229
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,264
She's doing some independent research.

230
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,600
I mean, I'm Papa's daughter.

231
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,768
I can't help being like him.

232
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:53,977
Melissa.

233
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,896
Hello, Miss.

234
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,898
Hello, Sam.

235
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:02,527
Thanks for always taking care of Papa,
who does nothing but research all the time.

236
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,488
I can't say anything to that.

237
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,656
More importantly, what are you doing here?

238
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,951
To celebrate you completing
the first stage of your research,

239
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,162
I invited a certain person.

240
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,580
A certain person?

241
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:16,750
Someone you love, Papa.

242
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:22,672
I am here... shaking with
emotion from our reunion!

243
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,424
Toshi?!

244
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,510
All Might?!

245
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,678
Th-The real thing?

246
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:33,308
I came all this way just to see you, Dave!

247
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:36,019
Well? Were you surprised?

248
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,730
Y-Yeah...

249
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,108
Very surprised...

250
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,610
We both need to thank Melissa!

251
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,654
Man, how long has it been?

252
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:50,117
Oh, don't remind me about how old I am.
Neither one of us wants to think about that, do we?

253
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,745
Yeah, that's true!

254
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:57,040
I'm glad I could see you, Dave.

255
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,709
I'm glad to see you, too, All Might.

256
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:06,716
Young Midoriya, let me introduce you
to one of my best friends, David Shield--

257
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:07,759
I know who he is!

258
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,511
Professor David Shield!

259
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,889
A top scientist in Quirk research
who received a Nobel Quirk Prize!

260
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,308
He was All Might's partner
when he lived in America,

261
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,145
and for All Might's hero costumes--

262
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,479
“Young Age“!

263
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,189
"Bronze Age"!

264
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,191
"Silver Age"!

265
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,403
And "Golden Age"!

266
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,364
He was the genius inventor
who created all of those!

267
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,199
I never thought I'd be able
to meet him in person!

268
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,869
L-I'm so moved!

269
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,290
It looks like I don't need to introduce myself.

270
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,958
I'm sorry! It's just--

271
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,252
No, it's fine.

272
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,758
It's been a long time
since I last saw All Might.

273
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,344
Can you give us some time to talk alone?

274
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,804
Oh, sure.

275
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:57,142
Melissa, please show Midoriya around I-Expo.

276
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,935
Okay, Papa.

277
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,270
Really?

278
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,481
I'm honored to be able to go with a future hero!

279
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,399
Let's go!

280
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,402
Okay, I'm looking forward to it!

281
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,863
Sam.

282
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,907
You go rest, too.

283
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,493
What should I call you?

284
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,038
Midoriya? lzuku?

285
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,165
Please call me...

286
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,293
...Deku.

287
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,502
"Deku"?

288
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,880
That's a strange nickname.

289
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,507
You can call me Melissa.

290
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,885
Excuse me.

291
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,306
Hey, are you all right, Toshi?

292
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,807
Thanks...

293
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,228
The amount of time I can keep muscle
form has gotten even shorter...

294
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,480
You told me about your symptoms over email,

295
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,358
but I didn't realize it had gotten so bad...

296
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,824
Wow, this is amazing.

297
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,954
Looking at it like this, it's hard to
believe that this is a man-made island.

298
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,957
We have all the facilities of a large city.

299
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,251
Just about all we <i>can't</i> do is travel.

300
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,835
Really?

301
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,004
It's because all the scientists and their
families here have a duty to confidentiality

302
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,840
to keep information from leaking out.

303
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,093
Wow!

304
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,179
It's the Monster Hero: Godzillo!

305
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,265
It's my first time seeing the real thing!

306
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,016
His Quirk's amazing!

307
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:24,020
He must've been invited by a sponsor.

308
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,982
To show off their newest items
and sign autographs and stuff.

309
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,150
It looks like there are
a lot of different events.

310
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,152
I-Expo's amazing!

311
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,947
There's a party with all
the industry guests tonight, too.

312
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,701
But you'll be at that, too, right?

313
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,203
Since you came with Uncle Might.

314
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:44,791
Was that why All Might told me
to bring formal clothes?

315
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,462
Oh, Deku! You should
definitely check out that pavilion!

316
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,633
So many of the newest hero items in one place!

317
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,427
Deku, look at this!

318
00:18:55,635 --> 00:19:00,181
This multipurpose Beagle can fly,
of course, but it can also move underwater.

319
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,474
Wow!

320
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:05,895
You can wear this diving suit up
to 7,000 meters in the deep sea.

321
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,355
SO deep!

322
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:11,568
These goggles are equipped
with 36 different sensors.

323
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,112
I can see too much!

324
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:19,617
Actually, almost everything here was
created based on things Papa's patented.

325
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,203
Wow, that's amazing!

326
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:29,127
Each and every item here helps heroes
around the world in their work.

327
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,922
You really respect your dad, don't you?

328
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:37,052
That's because it's my dream
to become a scientist like him.

329
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,889
Oh, speaking of which,
you go to the Academy here, right?

330
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,932
Yeah, I'm in my third year.

331
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:48,772
The I-Island Academy is where all those who
want to become scientists want to go, right?

332
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,858
I've still got a long way to go.

333
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:55,362
I need to study more.

334
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:02,327
I have to work harder
to become like All Might, too.

335
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,789
You really love Uncle Might, don't you?

336
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,291
You were so enthusiastic earlier.
It surprised me!

337
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,379
Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't help it...

338
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:16,257
You look like you're having fun, Deku.

339
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,759
U-Uraraka?!

340
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,427
What're you doing here?

341
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,762
You look like you're having fun.

342
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,013
You said it again?!

343
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,681
Ahem.

344
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,266
Yaoyorozu?!

345
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,560
You looked like you were having a lot of fun.

346
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,938
Midoriya. I overheard.

347
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,941
Jim's Earphone Jack is something to be feared!

348
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,192
Are they your friends?

349
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,194
They're my classmates from school...

350
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,405
And it looks like there's
a bit of a misunderstanding...

351
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:43,243
U-Um, Melissa is just
showing me around the expo.

352
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,746
That's right! My papa and Uncle Might are--

353
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:51,584
Please, don't tell them
that I came here with All Might!

354
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:52,752
--Stare...
--Why not?

355
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,255
--Stare...
--There are reasons...

356
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:58,007
--Stare...
--All right.

357
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,094
Do you want to go have tea at a cafe?

358
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,642
Oh, you all have had experience
working with pro heroes?

359
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,228
Just training and going on patrol.

360
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:14,357
I got caught up in an incident,
but all I did was evacuate people.

361
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:15,900
That's still amazing.

362
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,446
For some reason, I ended up
being in a TV commercial...

363
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,782
You can't do that normally. That's wonderful!

364
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:26,578
Tomorrow, we're planning on going to
the pavilion where the Academy's exhibit is.

365
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,663
--I'm really looking forward to it! --Oh, good...
It looks like the misunderstanding's cleared up...

366
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,039
--Melissa, do you have something there, too? --Oh, good...
It looks like the misunderstanding's cleared up...

367
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,708
--Yes, of course. --Oh, good... It looks
like the misunderstanding's cleared up...

368
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,460
Thanks for waiting.

369
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:34,919
That voice...

370
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,379
K-Kaminari!

371
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,548
And Mineta?!

372
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,175
What're you two doing?

373
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:44,345
They needed some temporary staff
for the expo, so we applied.

374
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,221
Right?

375
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,557
We can go see the expo on our breaks,

376
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,100
and we get paid.

377
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:54,397
And maybe we can even have wonderful
meetings with the cute girls who are attending!

378
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:57,317
Hey Midoriya, where did you meet that hottie?

379
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,985
Introduce us! Introduce us!

380
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,320
Well, um...

381
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,614
Do they also go to U.A.?

382
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:03,698
That's right.

383
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,116
We're going to be heroes.

384
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,910
What are you standing around talking for?!

385
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,538
If you're going to take
the money, then work harder!

386
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:12,749
L-lida--

387
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,209
You're here, too?

388
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:19,422
I come from a family of heroes,
so we received an invitation from I-Expo.

389
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,509
But my family was busy,
so I'm the only one who came.

390
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,427
You too, lida?

391
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:30,975
I also received invitations because my father
holds shares of I-Expo's sponsors' stock.

392
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:35,146
And since Yao-momo had two extra invites...

393
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,816
No hard feelings, rock-paper-scissors!

394
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,319
Oh, no!

395
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:43,530
After an impartial game of chance,

396
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,990
we were chosen to go with her.

397
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,536
Yup. The other girls came to the island, too.

398
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:50,912
Really?

399
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,250
We're planning on all going around together
once it opens to the public tomorrow.

400
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,127
Would you like me to show you around?

401
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,379
Would you?

402
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,213
Sure!

403
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,422
Yay!

404
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,925
T-Take us with you, too!

405
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,302
Wh-What was that?

406
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,766
Clear time, 33 seconds!

407
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,393
Eighth place!

408
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,311
Kirishima?!

409
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,188
Deku, is he also...?

410
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,315
Yes, he's a classmate.

411
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:22,318
Now, the next challenger is...

412
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:22,902
Ka...

413
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,696
Kacchan?!

414
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:30,034
Now, Villain Attack! Ready... go!

415
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,625
Die!

416
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,669
Die?

417
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,254
This is amazing!

418
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,589
He cleared it in 15 seconds!

419
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:45,300
He's in first place!

420
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,846
Oh? Isn't that Midoriya over there?

421
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,519
Why are You here?!

422
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,187
S-Stop that, Kacchan.

423
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,148
--People are watching--
--So what?!

424
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,816
Stop that, Bakugo!

425
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,985
--Why is that boy angry?
--I don't have business with you.

426
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,445
--That's how he always is...
--Don't act like the class rep here, too!

427
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,947
--It's a fated battle between men! --A class
rep is a class rep no matter where you are!

428
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,908
Kirishima, did you both receive
invitations to the expo, too?

429
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:15,330
No, Bakugo was the only one invited
since he won the U.A. sports festival.

430
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,081
I just came with him.

431
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,917
What, are you all going to try that now?

432
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,419
It's no use!

433
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,713
Since I'll definitely be better than you!

434
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,465
Yeah, you're right. Yeah.

435
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:28,259
But you won't know until you try.

436
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,803
Yeah, you're right. Wait--

437
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:36,142
Then hurry up and go get
your pathetic results, damn nerd!

438
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,394
O-Okay...!

439
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:42,106
Now, we've got a challenger coming
in at the spur of the moment!

440
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:45,943
Just what kind of results will he get?

441
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:49,030
Since I decided to do it...

442
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,240
One For All...

443
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,618
...Full Cowling!

444
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,955
Villain Attack! Ready... go!

445
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,043
To keep from injuring my arm...

446
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,671
...I'll use 5% of my power!

447
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:13,971
This is amazing, too!

448
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,891
Sixteen seconds! Second place!

449
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,104
He has amazing explosive power.

450
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,356
And his destructive power...

451
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,734
It's like Uncle Might's...

452
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,236
But...

453
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,279
Ahhh, so close!

454
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,115
That was amazing, Midoriya.

455
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,951
I didn't think I'd be able to get
so close to Kacchan's time--

456
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,744
The hell?! Impossible!

457
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:39,872
I'll go again and blow you away!

458
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,208
Wow! Wow! Wow!

459
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,419
F-Fourteen seconds!

460
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,338
He's jumped to the top!

461
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,465
Todoroki!

462
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:50,967
He's in your class, too?

463
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:51,759
Yes!

464
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,678
You're all amazing!

465
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,430
As expected of future heroes.

466
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,598
Oh, you don't have to say that.

467
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,268
Half-and-Half Bastard!

468
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,144
Bakugo.

469
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:04,272
Appearing suddenly trying to make
everyone think you're amazing, you bastard?!

470
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,565
Midoriya and the others are here, too?

471
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,150
Don't ignore me!

472
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,986
Why the hell are you here, anyway?

473
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,447
I'm here to represent
my father, who was invited.

474
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:13,781
Um... the next person is waiting...

475
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,783
Shut up! I'm going next!

476
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:17,243
Everyone, stop them!

477
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:19,495
U.A.'s embarrassing secrets
will be exposed to the world!

478
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,289
--R-Rig ht!
--Y-Yeah!

479
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,499
Kacchan, calm down!

480
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,126
--Oh, I'm sorry.
--Don't embarrass us any further!

481
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:25,835
--Oh, I'm sorry.
--Who're you calling embarrassing?!

482
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,713
--I was just thinking you guys
seem to have fun at U.A.
--Try to understand here, Bakugo!

483
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:32,550
--It's never boring, at least.
--What the hell's wrong with you guys? Let go!

484
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,761
--That's true...
--I'll burn you up!

485
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:44,187
I received the goods as planned.

486
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:49,609
What? All Might?

487
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:53,654
Don't panic. We'll deal with it.

488
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,409
All Might is on this island...

489
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,053
What's going on, Toshi?

490
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:21,015
Why are your Quirk numbers
going down so dramatically?!

491
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:24,268
Even if you were seriously injured
during your fight with All For One,

492
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,813
to suddenly get these numbers is too unusual.

493
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:30,233
What in the world happened to your body?!

494
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:37,490
If you're a hero for a long time,
your body's going to fall apart.

495
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,201
I can't tell him the secret of One For All.

496
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:47,375
If I do, then Dave and Melissa will get caught
up in the fight against All For One, too...

497
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:51,379
At this rate, the Symbol of Peace will be lost.

498
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:57,802
The only reason Japan is able to keep
its crime rate at 6% is because of you.

499
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,639
Other countries have crime rates
above 20% across the board...

500
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:07,562
There were so many times that
I wished you had just stayed in America...

501
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:13,150
There's no need to be so pessimistic.

502
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,653
There are many capable pro heroes,

503
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:19,282
and many people who
support the heroes, like you.

504
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,869
I can still be All Might a few hours every day--

505
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,620
But...

506
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:30,209
It's possible that another villain like
All For One will appear again somewhere...

507
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:32,378
Dave.

508
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:34,422
For the sake of when that happens, as well,

509
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:38,634
I have no intention of stepping down
from being the Symbol of Peace.

510
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:41,888
Besides, there is still hope...

511
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,975
For the will of One For All...

512
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,895
...and the Symbol of Peace...

513
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:52,106
...to connect to the next generation.

514
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:59,906
Today, we will be closing at 6 p.m.

515
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,617
Thank you for coming.

516
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:08,331
It's still the preopening
and we're already this busy...

517
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,791
What'll it be like tomorrow...?

518
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,252
Stop, I don't want to think about it!

519
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,838
Mineta, Kaminari!

520
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,048
Good work today!

521
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,634
You both worked hard today, huh?

522
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:21,802
What is this?

523
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:25,139
Invitations to the reception party.

524
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,223
Party...?

525
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,308
For us...?

526
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,560
Melissa prepared them for you.

527
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,854
She thought you should
at least have some fun today.

528
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:34,857
I had extra, so please use them if you'd like.

529
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,275
Kaminari...

530
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,152
Mineta...

531
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:41,948
Our hard work has been rewarded!

532
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:45,660
I heard that there will be quite
a few pro heroes at the party, as well.

533
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,787
In order to keep from
embarrassing the name of U.A.,

534
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:51,248
change into your formal clothes
and let us attend the party as a group!

535
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:55,378
We'll meet at 6:30 p.m.
in Lobby 7 of the central tower!

536
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:56,921
Make sure you're on time!

537
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,675
I will contact Todoroki and Bakugo.

538
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,426
Dismissed!

539
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:06,305
Lida's at full throttle!

540
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,307
See you later!

541
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,017
Yeah!

542
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:10,726
Deku.

543
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,269
Huh?

544
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,356
Will you go somewhere with me first?

545
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:18,317
Why would I go to a party?

546
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:22,405
I'm not gonna go listen to some guys I don't
know give speeches and then clap for them.

547
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,447
It's dumb.

548
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,825
I heard we can eat as much
fancy food as we want!

549
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,703
It's not like I brought formal clothes, anyway.

550
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,955
That's what I thought!

551
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,040
So I brought some for you, too!

552
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:36,210
You're way too prepared, Weird Hair!

553
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,758
Dave, I'll see you later...

554
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,635
...at the party!

555
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,262
Okay.

556
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,391
Toshi!

557
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:52,476
What's up?

558
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,520
Oh, uh, it's nothing...

559
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:57,898
See you at the party.

560
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:12,705
An accident during an experiment?!

561
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:15,458
There are still people
who didn't make it out yet!

562
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:32,850
Thanks.

563
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,769
I'm David Shield.

564
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:35,770
What's your name?

565
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:37,021
I'm All Might.

566
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,440
I'm a student trying to become a hero.

567
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:43,903
It's a costume made of the
newest materials just for you.

568
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,447
You should be able to
do a little more with this.

569
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,032
This is great.

570
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,806
The Symbol of Peace?

571
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:16,477
What I'm aiming for is a world
where everyone can live and laugh.

572
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:21,398
I want to become the Symbol of Peace
that shines a light on that world.

573
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:35,204
We've restrained them.

574
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,372
There were five guards.

575
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,915
Everything's going according to plan.

576
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,126
The security system is still working.

577
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:41,919
Keep them bound without killing them.

578
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:42,670
Yes, sir.

579
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,005
We will begin now.

580
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:47,049
It's going smoothly.

581
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,680
We're going to move, too.

582
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,396
This is the campus of the Academy,
where I go to school.

583
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:04,733
And this is the lab that I use.

584
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:07,778
Sorry it's so messy.

585
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:11,031
Wow, it looks so professional.

586
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,951
I can't believe you're doing
research in a place like this...

587
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:18,289
Melissa, you're really talented.

588
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,877
Actually, I wasn't getting very good grades.

589
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,588
That's why I studied really hard.

590
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,966
It's because I wanted
to become a hero no matter what.

591
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:30,384
A pro hero?

592
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:33,554
No, I gave that up early.

593
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,764
I'm Quirkless, after all.

594
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:39,185
Quirkless...?

595
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,604
I didn't have a Quirk even after I turned five,

596
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:44,190
so I was taken to a doctor.

597
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,194
I was told that I was the type
that would never get a Quirk.

598
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,654
The same as me...

599
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,740
Mom...

600
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:57,494
He saves everyone with a smile,
no matter what trouble they're in...

601
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:01,916
Can I... be a hero, too?

602
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,876
I'm sorry, lzuku!

603
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:07,087
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

604
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,631
S-Sorry...

605
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,132
I'm... I'm sorry...

606
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:12,134
Hm? What's the matter?

607
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,803
Oh, nothing...

608
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:20,976
It's just, to be told that you didn't have
what everyone around you had naturally...

609
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:23,187
Of course, I was shocked.

610
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:27,691
But I had a goal that was close to me.

611
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,735
A goal?

612
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:31,779
MY Papa.

613
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:35,282
Papa didn't have a Quirk
that would let him be a hero,

614
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:39,495
but he supports Uncle Might and
other heroes with the power of science.

615
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:43,749
It's indirect, but he is fighting for peace.

616
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,585
Someone who helps heroes...

617
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:47,920
That's right.

618
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:51,590
That's the way I hope to become a hero.

619
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:58,472
I made this support item
before while watching Uncle Might.

620
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,391
Watching All Might?

621
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,436
Try pressing this panel.

622
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:12,778
This is...

623
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:14,071
If I had to give it a name,

624
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,699
I'd call it "Full Gauntlet," I think.

625
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:23,872
When I first met you and
saw the scars on your hands

626
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:29,586
and saw how you seemed to be limiting
your Quirk on purpose at the attraction,

627
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,422
I thought--

628
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:36,802
Maybe your Quirk is too strong,
and your body can't keep up.

629
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:39,013
She figured it out...!

630
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:44,935
This Full Gauntlet is strong enough to take the
full power of Uncle Might's punches three times.

631
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:51,233
If you wear these, I think
you'll be able to use your full power.

632
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:54,153
My... power...

633
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,988
Please use them.

634
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,949
Huh? But isn't it something important“?

635
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:01,618
That's why I want you to use them.

636
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:07,166
Become a wonderful hero
who can save people in trouble, okay?

637
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,545
Okay!

638
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:17,885
Hello?

639
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,386
What are you doing, Midoriya?!

640
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:24,266
"Lida"

641
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,483
Sorry I'm late!

642
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,860
Huh? Wait, where's everyone else?

643
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:39,114
They're not here yet. What do they think
"attending as a group" means?!

644
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:43,786
Sorry! I'm late...

645
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,625
I apologize, but Jiro...

646
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,378
Oh, Yes! Yes!

647
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:55,923
I'm... not used to clothes like this...

648
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,175
The clothes make the man, right?

649
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,010
She looks like a female assassin...

650
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:02,262
Shut up.

651
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,431
What? I complimented you!

652
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,599
No, you didn't.

653
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:07,893
It's my first time wearing formal clothes.

654
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:09,812
I borrowed this from Yaoyorozu...

655
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,313
I-It looks good on you.

656
00:37:11,522 --> 00:37:12,648
Yeah, really good!

657
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,734
Oh, Deku! You don't have to flatter me...!

658
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:17,319
Uraraka?!

659
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:22,449
Oh, are you all still here?

660
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,535
The party's starting!

661
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,413
The headliner has appeared!

662
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:31,542
Crap, Mineta, I can't take this anymore.
What should I do?

663
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,544
Do whatever you want.

664
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:43,762
"Central Tower - 2nd Floor - Reception Hall"

665
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,806
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to I-Expo's reception party.

666
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:50,644
Let's have the number one hero,
All Might, who is visiting us today,

667
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:53,355
say a few words and lead us in a toast!

668
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:56,942
Everyone, please give him a round of applause!

669
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:59,528
Please, come to the stage.

670
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,947
Dave, I didn't know about this.

671
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:04,741
This was bound to happen once
they found out All Might would be here.

672
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,618
Jeez...

673
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,204
It's no good.

674
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:13,792
Neither Bakugo nor Kirishima are picking up.

675
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:17,588
Hey, are you absolutely
sure this is the right way?

676
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,715
I think it is...

677
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,008
You <i>think?!</i>

678
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:24,887
Well, actually, I left my phone in my room...

679
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:30,350
Thank you for inviting me. I am All Might.

680
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,061
I don't like formal talk, so--

681
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,816
This is an announcement
by the I-Island security system.

682
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:40,903
"I-Island - Business Area"

683
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,113
that an explosive device
was placed in the I-Expo area.

684
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:44,740
"A bomb?!
--Seriously?!

685
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:49,953
I-island will now be in high alert mode.

686
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,372
--Residents and tourists should
return to their homes or lodgings.

687
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,374
"I-Island - Hotel Room"
--No way...
--Residents and tourists should
return to their homes or lodgings.

688
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:54,458
--Will everything be okay...?
--Residents and tourists should
return to their homes or lodgings.

689
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,002
--We'll be safe as long as we follow directions.
--Those that have come a long way should
go and wait at the nearest evacuation center.

690
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,212
--You're right.
--Those that have come a long way should
go and wait at the nearest evacuation center.

691
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,758
Anyone still outside ten minutes
from now may be arrested without warning.

692
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,218
--Let's hurry to our rooms.
--Please refrain from going outdoors.

693
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,594
--Right.
--Please refrain from going outdoors.

694
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:11,058
In addition, most of the main buildings
will be sealed off by the security system.

695
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,435
I repeat--

696
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:19,942
It's just as you heard.

697
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,195
We have taken over the security system.

698
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:26,073
Don't think you're going to put up a fight.

699
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,325
If you do...

700
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:36,208
...then the security machines will bare their
fangs at all the good people on this island.

701
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,167
That's right.

702
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:42,047
All the people on this island are hostages.

703
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:46,301
Of course, you all are, as well.

704
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,719
Do it.

705
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,393
The restraining devices used for security...!

706
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,270
This isn't good!

707
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:59,064
Don't move!

708
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:02,401
If you take even one step,
then I'll kill everyone here in a second.

709
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,194
Shit!

710
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,573
Good boy.

711
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:12,619
You're all going to learn from All Might
and do what I say quietly, right?

712
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:15,706
Toshi, we have no choice
but to listen to them right now.

713
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,499
But, Dave...

714
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,502
I will definitely find a way to save everyone.

715
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:23,213
Just bear with it until then.

716
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,925
My phone has no signal.

717
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:29,928
It looks like all reports are being blocked.

718
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:31,430
Seriously...?

719
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,140
The elevator isn't responding, either.

720
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,891
Seriously?!

721
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,603
I can't believe the security system
would switch to high alert mode

722
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:40,939
just because they found something explosive.

723
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:43,900
Lida, let's go to where the party is being held.

724
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,110
Why?

725
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,154
Because All Might is at the party.

726
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,614
All Might is?

727
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,950
Oh, then we have nothing to worry about.

728
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:56,079
Melissa, can you get us to the party somehow?

729
00:40:56,288 --> 00:41:00,459
If we use the emergency stairs,
I think we can get close to the party.

730
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,753
Please lead the way!

731
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:07,424
Our phones have no signal,
and we can't use the internet, either.

732
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,968
We can't watch TV anymore, either.

733
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,345
It can't be helped.

734
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:14,348
Why don't we play Uno until they find the bomb?

735
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:16,808
Don't worry.

736
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:20,103
If you stay quiet, you will not be hurt.

737
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:23,023
We are prepared to release
you once the time comes.

738
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,858
What are you all after?

739
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,986
Didn't you hear me?

740
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:30,238
I said, stay quiet.

741
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,868
Oh right, got it.

742
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:40,457
You're a researcher here, right?

743
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,167
Y-Yes.

744
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:43,085
Take him.

745
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,252
What in the world...?

746
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:45,962
Stop!

747
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,964
He is my assistant.

748
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:50,592
What do you plan to do with him?

749
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:53,220
If it isn't David Shield...

750
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,721
You come, too.

751
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,848
And if I refuse?

752
00:41:57,057 --> 00:42:01,978
Then somewhere on this island,
someone's scream will ring out.

753
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:05,565
Fine. I will go.

754
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:09,903
Dave...

755
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:13,532
Will I be able to defeat the villains
and get the security system to work again?

756
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,326
Especially in this body...?

757
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:19,037
No, I must do it.

758
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:22,457
Because I am the Symbol of Peace!

759
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,422
Y-Young Midoriya!

760
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,090
All Might's noticed us.

761
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,800
Jiro, can you do it?

762
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,343
Yeah.

763
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,053
Please talk.

764
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,722
We're listening!

765
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,140
Can you hear me?

766
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,933
The villains have taken over the tower.

767
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:41,935
They have control of the security system,

768
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:45,522
and everyone on this island is a hostage.

769
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:47,941
All the heroes have been taken, as well.

770
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:48,900
It's dangerous.

771
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:51,486
Get away from here as soon as possible.

772
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:53,780
Th-This is bad, Midoriya.

773
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:00,078
We have received All Might's message.

774
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:06,752
I suggest that we follow the directions of
U.A. teacher All Might and escape from this place.

775
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,254
I agree with lida's opinion.

776
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:11,506
We are still students.

777
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:15,135
We cannot fight against villains
without our hero licenses.

778
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,679
Then what if we escape and tell heroes outside--

779
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:20,432
I think it'll be hard to escape.

780
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,936
This place is built with the
same level of security as Tartarus,

781
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:26,646
where criminal villains are kept.

782
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:30,066
Then, all we can do is wait until help comes...

783
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,402
Kaminari, are you okay with that?

784
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:33,779
What do you mean?

785
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,031
You don't feel like you should go help?

786
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,034
Hey, hey, the villains even caught All Might!

787
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:44,039
There's no way we can go save them ourselves!

788
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,625
We are trying to become heroes.

789
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,795
Yes, but we are still not
allowed to work as heroes--

790
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:53,507
Does that mean it's all right
for us to not do anything?

791
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:56,802
Th-That's...

792
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:01,598
I want to save them.

793
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:03,934
Deku?

794
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,477
I want to go save them.

795
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,312
You're planning on fighting the villains?!

796
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:10,106
Didn't you learn anything from USJ, Midoriya?!

797
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:11,942
It's not like that, Mineta.

798
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,860
I've thought about it.

799
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:19,533
We need a way we can save All Might
and the others without fighting the villains.

800
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,410
I understand how you feel,
but is there anything that convenient...?

801
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,788
Even if it's hard, I still want to try!

802
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:30,710
I want to look for the best way
possible and then go save everyone!

803
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:33,797
Deku.

804
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:38,844
I-island's security system is
on the top floor of this tower.

805
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,429
If the villains have taken
control of the system,

806
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:45,350
then the authentication locks and
passwords should have been disabled.

807
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:48,603
We should be able to restart the system.

808
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:53,233
We just need to get away from the eyes
of the villains and get to the top floor...

809
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:56,611
Then, maybe we can save everyone.

810
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,572
Melissa...

811
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,241
What do you mean by "get away
from the eyes of the villains"? How?

812
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,702
Currently, none of us have actually been harmed.

813
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,247
I think the villains aren't used
to working with the security system.

814
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,876
Avoid fighting and get the
system back to normal, huh?

815
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:12,043
I see.

816
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:13,837
We could do it, don't you think?

817
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:14,921
--Yeah!
--Definitely!

818
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,592
But the villains are waiting on the top floor...

819
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,094
There's no need to fight!

820
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:22,804
If we get the system back to normal,

821
00:45:23,013 --> 00:45:25,807
then All Might and
the hostages will be released.

822
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:30,937
When that happens, the tables
will be turned in an instant!

823
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:32,731
Deku, let's do it!

824
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:33,940
Uraraka!

825
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:38,320
I don't want to sit around doing nothing
if there's something we can do.

826
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:42,365
I think that's something that's more
important than whether we're heroes or not.

827
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:45,410
Yeah, let's help the people who need help!

828
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:47,662
Let's do what our natural
instincts are telling us to do.

829
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:49,039
Yeah!

830
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,999
Midoriya.

831
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,250
I'll go, too.

832
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:53,418
Me, too.

833
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:54,377
Todoroki!

834
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:55,587
Kyoka!

835
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,924
I'll turn us back if I decide
we cannot do anymore.

836
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:01,676
If you're okay with that, then I will go, too!

837
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:02,761
Lida!

838
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,971
If that's the case, then I will go, too!

839
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,348
All right, me too!

840
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:07,390
Yaoyorozu!

841
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,225
Kaminari!

842
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:12,228
Oh, all right, I get it!
I just have to go, right?

843
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,022
Thanks, Mineta!

844
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,607
Let's take this on, Mineta!

845
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,068
Let's do our best, Mineta!

846
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,278
Melissa, please wait here.

847
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:22,280
I'll go, too.

848
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:25,075
But you don't have a Quirk...

849
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:30,413
Do you have anyone who can change
the settings of the security system?

850
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:32,290
I'm a student at the Academy.

851
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:33,792
I think I can be useful.

852
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,377
But...

853
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:39,881
I might just get in the way
until we get to the top floor...

854
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:43,134
...but let me help protect everyone, too.

855
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:45,011
Please!

856
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,057
All right.

857
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,977
Let's go and save everyone!

858
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:55,689
Right!

859
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,113
Young Midoriya?!

860
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,991
Those eyes... Don't tell me...

861
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,034
No, run away!

862
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:09,911
No, I won't run.

863
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,454
It's too dangerous.

864
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:15,250
I want to do what I can.

865
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:16,876
Young Midoriya...

866
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:19,295
I will definitely save everyone!

867
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:22,590
He's going, after all, huh?

868
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:27,971
I know that I must reproach him
as a teacher for his actions.

869
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:33,893
But, if you don't move now, you're not a hero.

870
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:36,688
In that case, I'll wait.

871
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:41,234
I'll believe that you all can
break us out of this situation.

872
00:47:41,443 --> 00:47:44,529
We're counting on you, you zygotes!

873
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:45,572
Let's go!

874
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,532
--Yeah!
--Okay!

875
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:53,455
"Central Tower - Top Floor - Control Room"

876
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:57,917
I brought him.

877
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:00,545
Hurry up and unlock the vault.

878
00:48:00,754 --> 00:48:03,256
Acting so high and mighty...

879
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:04,466
You heard him.

880
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,968
If you don't want to die,
then hurry up and do it.

881
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:09,596
R-Right.

882
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,139
Take him.

883
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,932
Get out.

884
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,727
"Central Tower - Emergency Stairs"

885
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:19,522
This is the 30th floor.

886
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:22,067
Melissa, what's the top floor?

887
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:24,069
The 200th floor.

888
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:25,028
Seriously?

889
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,905
We have to climb that much?!

890
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,783
It's better than running into villains.

891
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:39,209
Melissa, do you want me to use my Quirk on you?

892
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,711
Thanks, but I'm fine.

893
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,673
Save your power for when we really need it.

894
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,017
The shutter...!

895
00:48:56,226 --> 00:48:58,103
What should we do? Break it?

896
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:02,816
If we do that, then the security system
will react, and the villains will notice us.

897
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:05,193
Then can't we just go from here?

898
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,070
--Mineta!
--No!

899
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:09,697
What?

900
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:11,950
Did a door on the 80th floor open?

901
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:15,286
Did you make a mistake scanning each floor?

902
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,291
Let down all the partitions on the 80th floor.

903
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,334
Don't let those kids get away!

904
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:23,086
Roger.

905
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:26,714
Be careful, everyone.

906
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:29,259
Villains are crafty.

907
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:32,595
Is there any other way to go up?

908
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:35,723
There's another emergency staircase
like this on the opposite side.

909
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:37,058
Hurry!

910
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:41,187
The shutters are...

911
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:42,897
The ones behind us are, too!

912
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:43,982
Todoroki!

913
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,733
Right!

914
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,200
Let's cross inside here!

915
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,121
"80th Floor - Plant Factory"

916
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:58,746
A plant factory.

917
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:01,166
They research how Quirks influence plants here.

918
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:03,334
Wait! Look at that!

919
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:05,378
The elevator's coming up.

920
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:07,255
Are the villains following us...?

921
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,382
Let's hide and let them pass us!

922
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:16,389
I wonder if we can use that
elevator to get to the top floor?

923
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:20,685
No, only authorized people
can operate the elevators.

924
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:24,647
And it's made as sturdy as
a bomb shelter, so we can't destroy it.

925
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:27,525
Come on, let us use the
conveniences of modern civilization!

926
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:34,866
Those clothes... They're the
villains who were at the party.

927
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,160
They said the kids were in here.

928
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,704
They came into an annoying place.

929
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:40,663
They're coming!

930
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:41,748
Quiet.

931
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,375
Don't come... Don't come...

932
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:47,003
Go away... away...!

933
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:50,340
Please, don't notice us!

934
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,968
I found you, you damn kids!

935
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:57,764
What should we do? What should we do?

936
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,850
Huh? What did you say, you bastard?

937
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:02,852
Kacchan? And Kirishima?

938
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:05,188
What are you two doing here?

939
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:09,234
--That's what I want to know--
--Leave this to me, okay?!

940
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:11,903
Um, we got lost...

941
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:15,031
Where should we go for the reception?

942
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,534
Why did you come all the way
to the 80th floor if you got lost?!

943
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:21,329
I can see through you! Don't lie to me!

944
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:22,205
His Quirk!

945
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,623
Kirishima...!

946
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,711
This Quirk is...

947
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,380
Todoroki?!

948
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:35,635
We'll stall for time here.

949
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,387
Look for a way to get to the top!

950
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:38,179
Todoroki!

951
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:39,264
What about you?

952
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:40,473
I'm fine, just go!

953
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:41,599
Todoroki!

954
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:44,352
I'll be right behind you after I clean this up.

955
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,187
Right!

956
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:48,022
You're all here, too?

957
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:49,816
What's going on, Todoroki?

958
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,484
You didn't hear the broadcast?

959
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:52,193
Huh?

960
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:54,279
Villains have taken over this tower.

961
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:56,114
"Huh?
--What?!

962
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:57,991
I'll explain more later.

963
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,118
For now, the villains...

964
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:02,996
What's with that Quirk?

965
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:04,122
Don't let your guard down.

966
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,332
Shut up! I know!

967
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:08,543
You kids...

968
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:11,838
Don't take advantage of us!

969
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,264
Die...!

970
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:24,976
BakLugo!

971
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:30,898
--Kirishima!
--Dodge!

972
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:41,284
You boys aren't normal kids, are you?

973
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:42,452
What are you?

974
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,621
Like we'd tell you, damn villains!

975
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,666
You're not worth telling my name to.

976
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,131
This is no good, either?

977
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:59,719
Hey, what should we do?
We're like mice caught in a bag!

978
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,637
Is this as far as we can go?

979
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:05,808
Melissa, do you see something
that looks like a door on the ceiling?

980
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:07,810
Over there!

981
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:11,481
The maintenance room for the sunlight system!

982
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,859
Wouldn't that have an emergency ladder?

983
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:20,073
It's true that there's a manual one,
but we can only access it from the inside.

984
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,992
Even though we got this far...

985
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:25,536
There's still a possibility.

986
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:33,336
If you go outside through the space in the vent,

987
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,546
you can use the outside wall
to get to the top floor.

988
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:38,508
That's right! As long as
there's something similar up top--

989
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,510
We can get inside!

990
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:46,265
Who can get into the cramped vent
and climb up the outer wall...?

991
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:47,183
Huh?

992
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:49,143
W-Wait, me?!

993
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:50,478
Please, Mineta!

994
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,313
You're the only one who can do it!

995
00:53:52,522 --> 00:53:56,025
Stupid! Stupid! Just what
floor do you think we're on?!

996
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:58,403
If you save everyone and become distinguished,

997
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:02,657
then they'll interview you, and you'll
definitely be super popular with the girls!

998
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:03,783
Please!

999
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,327
Harem, harem!

1000
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:10,623
All right! I just have to go, right?!

1001
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:14,710
Harem, harem, harem!

1002
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:18,256
Harem, harem, harem!

1003
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,465
Harem, harem!

1004
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:21,926
"Maintenance Room"

1005
00:54:24,554 --> 00:54:25,430
I did it!

1006
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:27,765
I made it!

1007
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:32,270
Now, now, now, give me some love!

1008
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:35,982
Just the ladies is fine. Just the ladies.

1009
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,692
You were amazing, Mineta.

1010
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,695
As expected of a student hero!

1011
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,158
Come on, let's get fired up, everyone!

1012
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:46,576
Yeah!

1013
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,328
Hey, you still can't find them?

1014
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:52,206
Damn it!

1015
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:55,084
Hey, 80th floor! The kids are getting away!

1016
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:56,461
What's going on?!

1017
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:59,005
Be quiet! Shut up--

1018
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:26,073
That guy's not opening up a hole in space.

1019
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:27,700
He's hollowing it out!

1020
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:30,286
Is that how it is?

1021
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:32,788
Damn it, they just won't stop.

1022
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:37,543
I can't keep playing with you forever!

1023
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:44,425
Howitzer... Impact!

1024
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:51,474
--I can't believe this!
--Bakugo!

1025
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,979
Damn it... Hm?

1026
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:57,980
What the hell?

1027
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:00,441
It's the sweat from my palms.

1028
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,860
It's like nitroglycerin.

1029
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:17,041
Kirishima!

1030
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:17,917
Are you all right?

1031
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,002
I-I can't move...

1032
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:22,004
Help me.

1033
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,464
Are you dumb?

1034
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:25,508
You just have to turn off your Quirk.

1035
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,469
Oh... right.

1036
00:56:28,678 --> 00:56:30,221
But man, that surprised me.

1037
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,348
I'm just glad you're uninjured.

1038
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:34,809
Yeah, you too!

1039
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:38,396
Thanks...

1040
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:39,897
What the hell? That's not like you.

1041
00:56:40,106 --> 00:56:40,940
Don't worry about it!

1042
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:42,400
I'm not worrying!

1043
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,402
All right, let's go after
Midoriya and the others.

1044
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,903
Don't tell me what to do!

1045
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:48,531
Todoroki, give us the details.

1046
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:55,621
Looks like they've gotten serious.

1047
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,708
Boss, those are no ordinary kids!

1048
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,668
They're students from
U.A. High School's hero course--

1049
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,211
Hero reserves!

1050
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:06,924
The brats are probably trying
to restore the security system.

1051
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:09,760
You started the security machine
on the 80th floor, right?

1052
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:10,886
Yes, sir!

1053
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:14,932
Then raise all the partitions
on floors 100 to 130.

1054
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:15,766
Huh?

1055
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:18,436
Do what I say.

1056
00:57:20,313 --> 00:57:21,772
Doesn't it seem like we got lucky?

1057
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:24,692
All the shutters have been raised
since we passed the 100th floor.

1058
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,194
Could they have lost us?

1059
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:28,529
That's probably not it.

1060
00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:31,032
They're leading us somewhere, aren't they?

1061
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,033
Yeah.

1062
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:35,077
Even so, to get just a little further up...

1063
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:37,622
...we'll go where they want us to go.

1064
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:45,087
"130th Floor - Laboratory"

1065
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:47,465
It looks like the enemy has changed
from shutting us in to trying to capture us.

1066
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:52,053
I'm sure they realized that we're U.A. students.

1067
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:55,973
But in that case, we know what to expect, too!

1068
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:58,893
Yeah. Let's go with Plan A, then.

1069
00:57:59,101 --> 00:57:59,769
Kaminari!

1070
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,355
All right, I'll do my best, too!

1071
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:03,606
I'm counting on you, lida!

1072
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,274
Right!

1073
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:15,159
Take this... indiscriminate
Shock 1.3 Million Volts!

1074
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,119
They defended!

1075
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:22,500
Damn it, then... 2 Million Volts!

1076
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:25,711
Idiot! If you do that...

1077
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,213
Yay...

1078
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,256
...then you'll turn dumb.

1079
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:32,760
But thanks to him, the security
machines have been stopped.

1080
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:35,012
Kaminari!

1081
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:37,848
They' re too sturdy...

1082
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,433
We have no choice... Everyone!

1083
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:40,267
Plan B!

1084
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:41,894
Right!

1085
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,650
We can jam their communications with this!

1086
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:48,609
Take that!

1087
00:58:48,818 --> 00:58:49,527
And this!

1088
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,362
Go!

1089
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:53,739
Mineta!

1090
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,074
Give Kaminari back!

1091
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:57,660
He's got a harem waiting!

1092
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:02,123
How's that?!

1093
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:04,625
Man, they won't stop!

1094
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:06,210
Let's go, Midoriya!

1095
00:59:06,419 --> 00:59:07,586
Yeah!

1096
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:15,886
One For All... Full Cowling!

1097
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,347
Full Gauntlet!

1098
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:23,227
If you wear it, I think you'll
be able to use your full power.

1099
00:59:23,436 --> 00:59:26,272
First, 30% of my power...

1100
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,024
Smash!

1101
00:59:30,735 --> 00:59:33,487
It doesn't hurt. My arm's fine, too.

1102
00:59:33,696 --> 00:59:34,655
I can do this!

1103
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:36,782
Whee!

1104
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:38,534
Jiro!

1105
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:39,827
Where are the security machines?!

1106
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:41,245
They're coming from the left!

1107
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:43,164
Okay, let's keep going from the right!

1108
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:44,081
--Right!
--Yeah!

1109
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,709
Deku, what's with that arm? It's amazing!

1110
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:47,710
Yeah!

1111
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,628
Melissa, it worked perfectly!

1112
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:51,464
You brought it, huh?

1113
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:54,216
I didn't know how to take it off...

1114
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:58,095
Boss, there's something interfering
with the sensors on the security machines.

1115
00:59:58,304 --> 01:00:00,097
We lost those kids!

1116
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:01,640
Don't lose your presence of mind.

1117
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:06,854
There's probably someone among
those brats with a hearing Quirk.

1118
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:09,815
I hear a lot of security machine
wheels coming from the floor below.

1119
01:00:10,024 --> 01:00:10,900
Any sounds from above?

1120
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,402
--No. It's fine.
--Let's go!

1121
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:17,156
"138th Floor - Server Room"

1122
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:25,790
A trap?!

1123
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:27,082
Let's break through, lida!

1124
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,292
Wait!

1125
01:00:28,501 --> 01:00:33,339
If the servers here are damaged,
then it could affect the security system, too.

1126
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:38,052
Just how many are there?!

1127
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,554
We'll stop the security machines here.

1128
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:44,433
Midoriya, take Melissa
and find a different route!

1129
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:47,144
Come with me, Melissa!

1130
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,022
Ochaco, you come with us, too!

1131
01:00:50,231 --> 01:00:51,774
Huh? But--

1132
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,567
Please, Uraraka!

1133
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:55,611
Right!

1134
01:00:58,364 --> 01:01:00,908
Torque Over...

1135
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:04,453
...Reciproburst!

1136
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,167
I'll leave the gun to you.

1137
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:11,836
I'll make ammo!

1138
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:13,963
Roger!

1139
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:20,302
I won't let you have my harem, okay?!

1140
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,388
Yay...

1141
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:26,141
Go!

1142
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:33,232
Deku, you can't stop!

1143
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,111
If we get caught here, then there was
no point in lida and the others staying behind!

1144
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,280
R-Right!

1145
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:41,907
Everyone, please be okay!

1146
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,830
My engine stalled?

1147
01:01:48,998 --> 01:01:49,957
Lida!

1148
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:52,126
Yao-momo, ammo!

1149
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,252
Yo ormemme'?

1150
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,046
I-I've reached my limit with Creation...

1151
01:01:56,255 --> 01:01:59,174
My scalp's reached its limit, too...

1152
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,221
It's 'cause you kids were getting carried away!

1153
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:05,598
What about the three who ran?

1154
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:07,016
We're looking for them now.

1155
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,977
Damn it, they're so annoying!

1156
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,563
Th-This is...

1157
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:14,565
The wind power generator system.

1158
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:16,275
Why here?

1159
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:20,905
If we go up through the tower, the security
machines are probably waiting to ambush us.

1160
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:23,908
So we'll go up to the top all at once from here.

1161
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:25,826
If we can just get to that emergency exit...

1162
01:02:26,035 --> 01:02:28,495
All the way up there?

1163
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:31,916
If we have Ochaco's Quirk that lets
her make anything she touches weightless,

1164
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:33,918
then we can do it.

1165
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:37,338
Right. Leave it to me.

1166
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:41,216
Melissa, hang on to Deku.

1167
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:42,968
Okay!

1168
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,933
Go...!

1169
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:53,145
All right!

1170
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:55,564
Oh, no...!

1171
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:56,607
Uraraka!

1172
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,275
Release your Quirk and run away!

1173
01:02:58,484 --> 01:02:59,401
I can't!

1174
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:02,237
If I do that, then we can't save everyone!

1175
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,323
Ochaco!

1176
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:05,950
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1177
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:09,286
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

1178
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:12,957
Kacchan!

1179
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:18,504
Todoroki and Kirishima!

1180
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:20,047
Are you okay, Uraraka?

1181
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:21,674
Yeah, I'm fine.

1182
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:25,386
Deku and Melissa are heading
to the top floor right now.

1183
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:26,971
Yeah, I saw.

1184
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:29,264
We're going to stop these guys right here!

1185
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:30,474
Don't tell me...

1186
01:03:30,683 --> 01:03:31,433
...what to do!

1187
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,519
But you guys are a good team!

1188
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:34,311
As if!

1189
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,480
Thanks, everyon--

1190
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:39,316
Deku! Melissa!

1191
01:03:39,525 --> 01:03:41,610
Bakugo! Aim the propeller at Midoriya!

1192
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:45,030
I said, don't tell me what to do!

1193
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:56,250
A hot wind!

1194
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:57,209
Wow!

1195
01:03:57,418 --> 01:04:00,713
Todoroki, you used your flames...

1196
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:02,589
Thanks!

1197
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:03,716
Deku!

1198
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:05,634
You're going to hit the wall!

1199
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:11,890
This Full Gauntlet is strong enough to take the
full power of Uncle Might's punches three times.

1200
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:14,727
This is no time to hold back!

1201
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:15,769
Hang on tight!

1202
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:17,396
Okay!

1203
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:20,566
One For All: Full Cowling!

1204
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:23,485
Detroit...

1205
01:04:23,694 --> 01:04:26,572
...Smash!

1206
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,033
They got into the tower!

1207
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:30,576
Release!

1208
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:33,912
Send Swordkil and the others!

1209
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:34,872
Yes, sir!

1210
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,833
Defend the control room until I get there!

1211
01:04:38,042 --> 01:04:38,876
Bear it...

1212
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,211
Bear it, All Might!

1213
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,464
I'm sure they can do it!

1214
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:45,507
I'm sure!

1215
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,470
Deku, are you all right?

1216
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:51,472
I-I'm fine...

1217
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,973
What about you, Melissa?

1218
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:56,143
Yeah, I'm fine. Just some scratches.

1219
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:02,941
You revolting kids...!

1220
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:05,944
What are you all after?!

1221
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:09,364
Don't pretend to be heroes!

1222
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:12,493
Sum it!

1223
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:14,203
Get out of the way!

1224
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:18,248
--Smash!
--Little girl--

1225
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:23,128
Melissa!

1226
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:24,463
I'm fine.

1227
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,215
It's not too bad.

1228
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:27,758
Give me your arm.

1229
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:32,471
Sorry I couldn't protect you...

1230
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:34,807
You should be saying, "Thanks," right?

1231
01:05:39,228 --> 01:05:41,105
Yes!

1232
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:45,109
Let's go and save everyone!

1233
01:05:45,317 --> 01:05:46,819
Yes!

1234
01:05:51,657 --> 01:05:53,075
They're here!

1235
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:01,542
"Tower - Top Floor"

1236
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:01,792
Melissa, where's the control room?

1237
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,002
In front of the central elevator.

1238
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:07,256
Someone's here.

1239
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:11,760
Papa?

1240
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:13,262
Oh, it is!

1241
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,097
Why is he on the top floor...?

1242
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:18,267
Did the villains bring him here
to force him to do something?

1243
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:19,518
We have to save him!

1244
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,395
Yes.

1245
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:25,649
"Storage Room"

1246
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:30,904
I was able to unlock it. Go to block 1147.

1247
01:06:31,113 --> 01:06:32,906
O-Okay!

1248
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:34,366
I'm opening it.

1249
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:40,122
You did it, Professor!

1250
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,374
Everything is here.

1251
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:47,796
Yes, I have finally gotten it back.

1252
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:52,301
This device and research data are
the only things I would never give to anyone.

1253
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,553
I'll never give them up.

1254
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,471
Everything's going according to plan, isn't it?

1255
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,224
It looks like the villains are doing well, too.

1256
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:03,353
Thank you. It was all because
you arranged everything for me, Sam.

1257
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:04,855
Papa...

1258
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,859
Mel... Melissa...

1259
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:12,279
Miss, what are you doing here?

1260
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:15,324
What do you mean "arranged"?

1261
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:21,246
Papa, don't tell me you're
the one behind this incident?

1262
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:25,042
In order to get that device...?

1263
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:29,296
Is that true, Papa?

1264
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:35,677
It is.

1265
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:37,846
What...? Why...?

1266
01:07:38,055 --> 01:07:41,266
The professor is only trying
to get back what was stolen from him.

1267
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:46,230
This groundbreaking invention
that mechanically amplifies Quirks...

1268
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:48,023
It amplifies Quirks...?

1269
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:53,946
Yes, it is still in testing,
but with this device, unlike with drugs,

1270
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:59,117
Quirks can be amplified
without affecting the body.

1271
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:04,873
However, the sponsors confiscated
this invention and research data.

1272
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:07,793
The research itself was also frozen.

1273
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,588
If this was made known to the world,

1274
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:14,633
then the structure of superhuman
society would change drastically.

1275
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:20,180
Fearing that, governments from
different nations put pressure on him.

1276
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:23,475
That's why the professor...

1277
01:08:23,684 --> 01:08:27,312
I can get my research back?! How?

1278
01:08:27,521 --> 01:08:31,358
Instead of doing it ourselves,
we will have villains steal it.

1279
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:34,194
Don't be ridiculous...

1280
01:08:34,403 --> 01:08:38,532
There's no need for them to be real villains.

1281
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:43,036
We can hire people wearing the guise
of villains and have it be stolen by them.

1282
01:08:43,245 --> 01:08:46,665
Of course, they will not harm anyone.

1283
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:51,003
After it's done, we can continue
our research in a different place.

1284
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:52,546
But...

1285
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:55,924
I want to get the research back no matter what.

1286
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:59,136
Don't you feel the same way?

1287
01:09:00,262 --> 01:09:01,930
I have completed the preparations.

1288
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:06,101
We will carry this out on the day of the
I-Expo preopening when the tower will be closed.

1289
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,353
The plan will start at
the same time as the reception,

1290
01:09:08,562 --> 01:09:12,190
the only time when all the
people involved will be together.

1291
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,609
We will pull the strings in the back

1292
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:18,488
as the villains make it seem
like I-island has been taken over.

1293
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:22,743
Professor...

1294
01:09:26,747 --> 01:09:28,665
No...

1295
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:31,418
This is a lie, isn't it, Papa?

1296
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:32,627
Tell me this is a lie!

1297
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:34,713
It is not a lie.

1298
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,092
This doesn't make sense...

1299
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:42,721
The Papa I know would
never do anything like that!

1300
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:46,350
So why...? Why?

1301
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:51,438
It is for All Might.

1302
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:56,443
You two probably don't know,
but his Quirk is disappearing.

1303
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:01,823
However, if he uses my device,
then it can go back to normal.

1304
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:06,286
It can even give him more
abilities than he started with.

1305
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:08,413
The number one hero...

1306
01:10:08,622 --> 01:10:10,540
The Symbol of Peace...

1307
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:13,835
...can get his light back again...

1308
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:18,090
...and save many people once more!

1309
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:22,302
Because All Might passed One For All on to me...

1310
01:10:22,511 --> 01:10:26,890
The professor was worried about
All Might losing his power, and--

1311
01:10:27,099 --> 01:10:30,811
Please. Please let me hand
this device over to All Might.

1312
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:33,021
There's no time to remake it!

1313
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,607
After he gets it, I don't care
what kind of punishment I receive.

1314
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:38,610
--I've prepared myself--
--They risked their lives!

1315
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:46,618
What do you think Deku and his classmates
went through to save the hostages?

1316
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:50,330
What is the meaning of this?

1317
01:10:50,539 --> 01:10:52,207
The villains were fake...

1318
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:54,126
It should've all been an act...

1319
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:57,170
Of course it was an act.

1320
01:10:57,379 --> 01:11:00,215
An act pretending to be fake villains.

1321
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:02,134
That guy's--!

1322
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:08,223
Deku!

1323
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,893
A Quirk that lets him manipulate metal, huh?

1324
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,563
Stay there quietly for a bit.

1325
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:17,232
Sam, where's the device?

1326
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:18,692
H-Here.

1327
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,111
Sam...?

1328
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:24,156
Don't tell me you were planning on
giving the device to the villains all along.

1329
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:26,867
Y-You're the one who tricked me.

1330
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:31,663
I served you for so long, but you
let your research be frozen so easily,

1331
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:35,250
and the honor and renown we were
supposed to get all went away...

1332
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:43,550
If I didn't get at least some money,
then it was a waste of my time!

1333
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:46,553
Here's the reward I promised you.

1334
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:48,305
Sam!

1335
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:49,639
Wh-Why...?

1336
01:11:49,848 --> 01:11:51,516
This isn't what you promised!

1337
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:52,976
Promised?

1338
01:11:53,185 --> 01:11:54,853
I don't remember.

1339
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,272
This is your reward.

1340
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,821
Professor, why...?

1341
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:06,656
R-Run away!

1342
01:12:06,865 --> 01:12:07,824
Papa!

1343
01:12:08,033 --> 01:12:09,951
Don't come here!

1344
01:12:11,203 --> 01:12:12,704
Melissa!

1345
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:18,543
Feeling like playing hero after all this time?

1346
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:20,128
It's no use.

1347
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:24,633
No matter what reason you had,
you've dirtied your hands with evil deeds.

1348
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:30,972
Whether we're fake or real,
the crime you committed will not disappear.

1349
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:33,600
You're the same as us.

1350
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:39,564
You can no longer remain
a scientist or continue your research.

1351
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:43,026
You can only fall into the darkness of villains.

1352
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:52,452
All you can do right now is
mass-produce that device for me.

1353
01:12:52,661 --> 01:12:53,995
Hey, take him away.

1354
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:55,664
Give him back!

1355
01:12:57,374 --> 01:12:59,918
G-Give Papa back!

1356
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:04,881
That's right, I have to get rid
of all the professor's attachments.

1357
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:07,467
Stop it...!

1358
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:11,388
Smash...!

1359
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:15,392
Melissa!

1360
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,687
I'll save the professor and Sam!

1361
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,566
So, save everyone else...

1362
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:27,696
Follow her!

1363
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:28,530
Don't let her escape!

1364
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,240
Yes, sir!

1365
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:40,375
I won't let you past me!

1366
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:44,170
Don't get carried away!

1367
01:13:46,214 --> 01:13:47,507
Everyone...

1368
01:13:47,716 --> 01:13:48,967
Everyone...

1369
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,303
All Might...

1370
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:53,013
Papa...

1371
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:55,432
I will definitely...

1372
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,392
I will definitely...

1373
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:59,185
...save you!

1374
01:14:05,233 --> 01:14:08,737
Damn it, did she get the
security system back to normal?

1375
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:11,698
What the--

1376
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:13,408
They stopped?

1377
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:16,369
Did Midoriya and Melissa do it?

1378
01:14:16,578 --> 01:14:20,040
I-island's security system is
now operating in normal mode.

1379
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:21,458
It's back.

1380
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,627
My phone works again, too.

1381
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:25,587
Wh-What happened all of a sudden?

1382
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:26,755
What happened?

1383
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:28,632
Damn it!

1384
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:32,969
Did you do it, everyone?

1385
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,138
Where's the helicopter?

1386
01:14:35,347 --> 01:14:36,556
It has landed.

1387
01:14:36,765 --> 01:14:37,641
We're getting out of here.

1388
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:39,559
Y-Yes, sir.

1389
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:51,571
M-Move, lzuku Midoriya!

1390
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:55,367
What are you here for?

1391
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:59,579
I will do what I can right now.

1392
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:02,791
What's wrong, Melissa?

1393
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:08,129
Uncle Might! Papa's been taken by
the villains, and Deku's gone after them!

1394
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:12,300
It's fine! I will go!

1395
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:18,348
Boss, what about everyone else?

1396
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:21,059
We're leaving before the
security system gets reactivated.

1397
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:23,061
Y-Yes, sir!

1398
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:25,939
Kill...
me...

1399
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:29,609
I'll add just a few more sins...

1400
01:15:29,818 --> 01:15:32,529
Then, I'll make your wish come true.

1401
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:39,619
Wait!

1402
01:15:39,828 --> 01:15:42,747
Give the professor back!

1403
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:44,290
I see.

1404
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:47,627
Did you come to seize this man
who has committed wrongdoing?

1405
01:15:47,836 --> 01:15:49,379
No!

1406
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:53,550
I've come to save the professor!

1407
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:56,010
To save a criminal?

1408
01:15:57,262 --> 01:16:00,098
I'm going to save everyone!

1409
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,016
I'm going to save the professor, too!

1410
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:04,185
What are you saying?

1411
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:05,645
Shut up!

1412
01:16:05,854 --> 01:16:07,731
That's what heroes do!

1413
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:10,400
They save people who are in trouble!

1414
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:12,736
How?

1415
01:16:13,445 --> 01:16:16,364
Don't worry about me... Get away.

1416
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:21,619
Jeez, it's so inconvenient being a hero.

1417
01:16:21,828 --> 01:16:25,331
I didn't do much, and you already can't move.

1418
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:39,429
No matter what, it's not a smart way to live.

1419
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:40,388
Get us out!

1420
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:42,557
Roger!

1421
01:16:52,025 --> 01:16:56,529
That guy shouldn't be able to activate
his Quirk without touching me with his hand.

1422
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:04,454
You're...

1423
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:09,042
Deku!

1424
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:12,295
Professor!

1425
01:17:12,504 --> 01:17:13,379
Stop it.

1426
01:17:13,588 --> 01:17:14,839
Midoriya, get away.

1427
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:16,716
Melissa is...

1428
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:19,886
Melissa is waiting for you!

1429
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:24,307
You certainly are a hero.

1430
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:26,226
But you're an idiot.

1431
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,688
Don't give up. Think!

1432
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:34,317
What to do... What should I do...?!

1433
01:17:34,526 --> 01:17:35,985
Deku!

1434
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,405
Have a nice nap!

1435
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:45,787
--Crap... Damn it...!
--Deku!

1436
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:46,996
Give him back!

1437
01:17:47,205 --> 01:17:49,332
Give the professor back!

1438
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:52,001
Damn it...!

1439
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:56,339
This is the time to smile, Young Midoriya!

1440
01:18:03,513 --> 01:18:06,599
It's fine now. Why?

1441
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,145
Because I am here!

1442
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,439
All Might!

1443
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:19,153
I'll have you give my friend back, you villain!

1444
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,247
Papa...

1445
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:30,915
Papa!

1446
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,794
Me... Melissa...

1447
01:18:35,003 --> 01:18:37,297
It's fine now.

1448
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:39,257
I'm glad.

1449
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:42,927
All Might...

1450
01:18:43,136 --> 01:18:44,721
I...

1451
01:18:46,306 --> 01:18:48,141
All Might!

1452
01:18:50,727 --> 01:18:51,185
Papa!

1453
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:52,937
Professor!

1454
01:18:54,898 --> 01:18:56,107
That Sam...

1455
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:58,693
He said that All Might's Quirk was declining

1456
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:02,989
and that he didn't have the power he once had.

1457
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:05,867
He's using... the professor's...

1458
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,997
Shit! Time's...

1459
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:14,125
You don't know when to give up, huh?

1460
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:16,753
Texas...

1461
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:20,173
...Smash!

1462
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:21,174
What?!

1463
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:22,884
All Might!

1464
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,261
What do you call that?

1465
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:46,741
As expected of something by David Shield.

1466
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:50,912
I can tell that my Quirk is getting revitalized.

1467
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,083
This is good. This thing is great!

1468
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:58,002
Th-This is Dave's...

1469
01:19:58,211 --> 01:20:01,005
It's the power of the device Papa made...

1470
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:08,471
Now, in order to raise the price of this device,

1471
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:13,768
why don't we have a demonstration
of how it can blow All Might away?

1472
01:20:26,948 --> 01:20:28,449
All Might...

1473
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:30,618
It's as I thought...

1474
01:20:30,827 --> 01:20:33,871
He's at his limit!

1475
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:41,713
Uncle Might!

1476
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,845
Hurry up and get crushed!

1477
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:51,472
All Might!

1478
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:55,768
Go to hell!

1479
01:21:01,024 --> 01:21:04,277
How can you get beat up
by such a damn lame last boss?

1480
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,195
Huh, All Might?!

1481
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:07,989
Young Bakugo!

1482
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,533
While you can... the villains...

1483
01:21:10,742 --> 01:21:13,077
Todoroki! Everyone!

1484
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:15,747
We'll take on the lumps of metal!

1485
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:17,790
Yaoyorozu, take care of things here!

1486
01:21:17,999 --> 01:21:18,833
Right!

1487
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:22,670
With my students so motivated,

1488
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:26,716
I can't be held back by some stupid limit!

1489
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:32,513
I need to go past my limit, and go beyond!

1490
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:36,267
That's right, Plus Ultra!

1491
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:54,535
Carolina...

1492
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:57,121
...Smash!

1493
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:04,420
Prepare yourself, villain!

1494
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:09,133
Is this all you've got--?

1495
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:12,303
Prepare myself?

1496
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:15,139
You should take your own advice,

1497
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:17,058
All Might.

1498
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,603
What is this power...?

1499
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:27,443
All Might!

1500
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:29,362
Deku!

1501
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:32,490
Damn it...!

1502
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:39,288
This power enhances muscles...

1503
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:41,541
There are multiple Quirks...

1504
01:22:41,749 --> 01:22:43,417
D-Don't tell me...

1505
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:50,675
Yeah, when we were planning this extortion,
I received a call from that man.

1506
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:53,845
He said that he wanted to work with me.

1507
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:56,264
When I asked him why,

1508
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:59,016
this is what he said:

1509
01:22:59,225 --> 01:23:03,312
If All Might's friend has said he wants
to have a hand in something evil,

1510
01:23:03,521 --> 01:23:06,691
then I definitely want to help.

1511
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:11,696
It is unfortunate that I will not be
able to see All Might's face twist in pain

1512
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:14,198
when he finds out, though.

1513
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:18,578
All For One...!

1514
01:23:18,786 --> 01:23:21,914
You've finally stopped smiling, huh?

1515
01:23:22,123 --> 01:23:24,876
Noooo!

1516
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:34,552
All Might!

1517
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,803
Uncle...!

1518
01:23:36,012 --> 01:23:39,223
Farewell, All Might!

1519
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:44,645
Uncle Might!

1520
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:50,401
Detroit...

1521
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:55,323
...Smash!

1522
01:23:56,991 --> 01:23:58,826
That brat!

1523
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:09,212
Young Midoriya!

1524
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:13,049
With that body... It's too reckless!

1525
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:19,555
But a hero has to save those in trouble!

1526
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,019
Thanks.

1527
01:24:25,228 --> 01:24:29,148
It's true that I am in some trouble right now.

1528
01:24:29,357 --> 01:24:31,776
Lend me a hand, Young Midoriya.

1529
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,444
Yes, sir!

1530
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:42,954
Let's go!

1531
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:44,747
Yes, sir!

1532
01:24:46,624 --> 01:24:49,502
Worthless little brat!

1533
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:52,129
You're nothing better than trash!

1534
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:55,591
You don't know when to give up!

1535
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,053
You're the one who doesn't!

1536
01:25:04,642 --> 01:25:06,644
I won't let you!

1537
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:14,151
Out of my way!

1538
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:03,909
Ow...

1539
01:26:06,996 --> 01:26:09,498
What... is that?

1540
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:13,502
To overcome the crisis in front of you...

1541
01:26:13,711 --> 01:26:16,255
...with everything you've got...

1542
01:26:16,464 --> 01:26:17,798
...and save people...

1543
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:20,051
...with everything you've got.

1544
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:21,802
That is what makes...

1545
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:24,096
...a hero!

1546
01:26:24,305 --> 01:26:28,100
I'll crush you and the tower!

1547
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:33,647
Double Detroit...

1548
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:37,860
...Smash!

1549
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:02,218
Go...!

1550
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:03,427
All Might!

1551
01:27:03,636 --> 01:27:04,762
Midoriya!

1552
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,764
Get him!

1553
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:11,602
Go...

1554
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:13,062
...beyond!

1555
01:27:14,814 --> 01:27:16,190
Plus...

1556
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:19,693
...Ultra!

1557
01:28:01,444 --> 01:28:03,404
Did they do it?

1558
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:05,030
They did it...

1559
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:07,575
They finished off the villain!

1560
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,452
--Yes!
--All right!

1561
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:12,037
--They did it! --It's over!
--All Might!

1562
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:32,683
Deku!

1563
01:28:32,892 --> 01:28:33,976
Melissa.

1564
01:28:34,185 --> 01:28:36,312
I'm glad...

1565
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,440
Dave, Dave!

1566
01:28:41,942 --> 01:28:45,112
All...
Might...

1567
01:28:45,321 --> 01:28:48,199
I came to save you, Dave.

1568
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:50,159
Thanks...

1569
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:51,827
Papa!

1570
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:54,246
All Might!

1571
01:28:54,455 --> 01:28:58,709
If you want to thank someone,
you should thank Melissa and Young Midoriya.

1572
01:28:58,918 --> 01:29:03,047
I'm so glad... I really am...

1573
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:08,552
Thank you. Thanks to you all,
we were able to save everyone.

1574
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:11,013
It's thanks to you, too, Melissa.

1575
01:29:11,222 --> 01:29:16,477
I was saved so many times by your Full Gauntlet.

1576
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:19,855
Thank you very much.

1577
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:21,440
Deku...

1578
01:29:21,649 --> 01:29:25,277
Oh, but sorry! I broke it...

1579
01:29:25,486 --> 01:29:26,820
Don't worry about that.

1580
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:28,489
Deku!

1581
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:29,281
--Melissa!
--Hey! Hey!

1582
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:30,241
--You did it, Midoriya!
--Hey! Hey!

1583
01:29:30,449 --> 01:29:32,451
Are you two okay?

1584
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,661
We're fine!

1585
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:36,789
All Might and the professor are fine, too!

1586
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:38,290
Are you all okay?

1587
01:29:38,499 --> 01:29:40,709
We're fine!

1588
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:44,672
I heard most of it from Melissa.

1589
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,842
I...

1590
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:51,554
I was scared to lose your light...

1591
01:29:51,762 --> 01:29:55,266
I was scared that the peace
you built would crumble...

1592
01:29:56,517 --> 01:30:04,275
But my ideas and that device were nothing
more than ways to keep the status quo.

1593
01:30:06,235 --> 01:30:10,281
Even though the future, and hope,
were right there in front of me,

1594
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:13,867
I didn't notice them...

1595
01:30:14,076 --> 01:30:18,330
Like how Melissa is trying
to become my successor,

1596
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:20,457
you have lzuku Midoriya...

1597
01:30:20,666 --> 01:30:25,170
He's your successor, isn't he?

1598
01:30:25,379 --> 01:30:28,173
He's still not ready.

1599
01:30:28,382 --> 01:30:34,346
But in him hides the possibility
of shining as a hero more than anyone.

1600
01:30:37,266 --> 01:30:41,186
I can see it, too, Toshi...

1601
01:30:41,395 --> 01:30:43,480
A light like yours...

1602
01:30:45,107 --> 01:30:48,360
The light of a hero.
