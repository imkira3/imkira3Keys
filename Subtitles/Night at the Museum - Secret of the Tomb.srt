1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,820
Gentlemen, we are in danger.
There is a storm coming.

3
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,740
My men are terrified. We must leave.

4
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,460
That tomb is here somewhere.
I can feel it.

5
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,420
- Please, Robert, it's been two months!
- Archie, I'm not stopping!

6
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,740
Dad!

7
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,740
What's going on with this wind, Pop?

8
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,140
C.J, go wait in the truck.

9
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,820
- I don't want to just wait in the truck.
- I said go! Windows up!

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,380
Robert!

11
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,681
- Mr. Fredericks!
- What?

12
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,245
Help!

13
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:07,057
Help!

14
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,020
C.J? Are you all right?

15
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,970
- Yeah, I'm fine!
- I'm coming down!

16
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,660
Yes!

17
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,020
I looked for the tomb of Ahkmenrah
for 20 years, and what do you do?

18
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,129
You fall right into it!

19
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,980
Amir, start loading the trucks.

20
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,281
Mr. Fredericks...

21
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,500
there is no time.

22
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,260
The storm is almost upon us.

23
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,660
Then you'd better hurry.

24
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,485
Come on. Everybody works.

25
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,848
Hey! What's the matter with you?

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,860
He said, "We must leave
this place immediately.

27
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,980
"If anyone disturbs this tomb...

28
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,241
"the end will come."

29
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,082
"The end will come."

30
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,205
We load the trucks.

31
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,940
I can't help feeling we're making
a terrible mistake!

32
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,780
We're not making a mistake,
we're making history!

33
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,100
Don't worry!

34
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,607
C.J! Let's go!

35
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,207
"The end will come."

36
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,940
Welcome, everyone,
to the Grand Reopening...

37
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,100
of the newly renovated
Hayden Planetarium...

38
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,020
here at the Museum of Natural History.

39
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,780
New York's glitterati
have all turned out...

40
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,300
for what has promised to be
a memorable evening...

41
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,260
filled with the dazzling
special effects...

42
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,980
and technical wizardry we've all come
to admire from this museum...

43
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,860
and its renowned Night Program.

44
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,020
Tonight gonna be fun-fun!

45
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,700
Here come Dum Dum!

46
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,100
Hey, how we doing, Sac?

47
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,860
Rexy is waxed and buffed.

48
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,940
Teddy is grooming his moustache.

49
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,300
Oh, and I reviewed fire safety procedures
with the primordial men.

50
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,980
By the way, have you seen them lately?

51
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,460
- The museum has added a new one.
- What? No.

52
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,780
Oh, and make sure the
centurions stretch, all right?

53
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,140
They really went for it
in the dress rehearsal...

54
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,300
and they're just not used to
those kinds of dance moves.

55
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,300
Okay, everybody. Everybody, listen up.
I don't want to make anybody nervous...

56
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,940
but the mayor and the governor
are both out there.

57
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,820
And, I'm not 100 percent sure,
but I think Regis Philbin, too.

58
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,531
- Reeju Philbo?
- Yeah, Reeju Philbo.

59
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,540
Okay, Rexy, do me a favor.

60
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,127
Watch the tail, okay?
There's gonna be open flame.

61
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,700
Oh, Dexter...

62
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,060
how you doing, my man?

63
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,340
All limbered up?

64
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,660
Looking good. I like the tie.

65
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,380
Got kind of a Chippendales
thing going on.

66
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,740
All chalked up, ready to go?

67
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,580
Good. Okay, everybody relax
and have fun, okay?

68
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,881
Larry.

69
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,005
You better come see this.

70
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,580
- Have you ever seen it like this before?
- Never.

71
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,580
This corrosion has never
happened before.

72
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,180
It's always been exactly the same.

73
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,180
I wonder what's up with it.

74
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,860
I have no idea.

75
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,020
And to be honest...

76
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,800
my father knew the secrets of
the tablet better than I did.

77
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,242
Unfortunately,
he swore he'd never reveal them.

78
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,525
He never did.

79
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,207
You okay?

80
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,740
Yes.

81
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,860
Yes, I'm fine.

82
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,100
Just take it easy
out there tonight, all right?

83
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,100
You got 15 minutes till showtime.

84
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,020
We're gonna figure this out tomorrow.

85
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,401
All right.

86
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:33,060
Look at that! Doggone it!

87
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,740
Did you see that?
They're trying to catch the light.

88
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,940
I know. But you can't do it, boys!
You can't catch light!

89
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,620
It's as elusive as human happiness!

90
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,780
I should like to comment.

91
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,220
- Summon the apparatus.
- Yeah.

92
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,284
Summon the apparatus!

93
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,563
What are you gonna say?

94
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,041
L...

95
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,206
O...

96
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,407
L.

97
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,326
"Laugh out loud."
Yeah, that's what I did.

98
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,260
Now, post these adorable kittens

99
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,484
with my edict of approval to Facebook.

100
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,580
Give a big Texas "hell yeah"
from old Jedediah...

101
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,860
because I loved it too!

102
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,140
Just send a smiley face.

103
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,260
Yeah, but with a wink!

104
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,660
A smiley face and a wink!

105
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,420
- Guys, what are you doing?
- We're just watching kittens.

106
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,460
You're on in five minutes.
You got to focus, here.

107
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,140
I told you we don't have time for this!

108
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,090
You gave it a Texas "hell yeah!"

109
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,660
- Hey, Teddy, ready to roll?
- Indeed, Lawrence.

110
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,980
- Great.
- Battle of San Juan Hill cool as a cucumber.

111
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,282
Right now, butterflies like you
wouldn't believe.

112
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,580
You're gonna be great.

113
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,660
- Lawrence?
- Yeah.

114
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,180
Have you seen the Neanderthals lately?

115
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,940
No. Why does everybody
keep talking about this?

116
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,651
You may want to give it a look!

117
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,660
Hey, guys, what's going on?

118
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,820
Okay.

119
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,120
All right, very funny. That's hilarious.

120
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,980
You don't have to come down.
It's okay, really.

121
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,442
Hi, how are you? I'm Larry.

122
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,700
I'm Laaa...

123
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,340
You're "Laaa"?

124
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,340
Laaa.

125
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,220
Laaa. Okay, nice to meet you, Laaa.

126
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,965
Welcome aboard, and...

127
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,820
Yes, we look similar.

128
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,180
Yeah, we look like each other, I know.
It's a joke that somebody played.

129
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,660
Dr. McPhee had you made to look like me.

130
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,961
It's just a...

131
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,561
Stop it. Stop, okay?

132
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,010
- Dada?
- What?

133
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,340
Dada.

134
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,020
No, not your Dada.

135
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,731
Yeah, Dada.

136
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,020
- No. Stop.
- Dada.

137
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,700
- Dada!
- Dada!

138
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,843
No, I'm not his... I'm not your Dada.

139
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,765
Dum Dum got a new son-son!

140
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,043
No, he doesn't.

141
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,940
Dada!

142
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,890
Dada!

143
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,780
DR. McPHEE:
A toast to our new chairwoman.

144
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,889
Cheers, everyone. Cheers.

145
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,844
Cue the music.

146
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,051
And Teddy in three, two...

147
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,524
Since 1869, when I was
a mere boy of 11...

148
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,220
this museum has been a
shining beacon to our great city.

149
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,140
Tonight we'll expand
our horizons even further...

150
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,060
to the Sun, the Moon, and the stars.

151
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,340
From our very beginning mankind
has looked to the heavens

152
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,880
and given names to what he saw.

153
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,725
The constellations.

154
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,500
I thought you might like to meet them.

155
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,040
Cue the constellations.

156
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,405
Orion, the hunter!

157
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,126
What?

158
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,460
All planned. All planned.

159
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,445
I knew that was gonna happen. So, yeah.

160
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,660
Good. Going great, guys. Going great.

161
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,460
Let's drop the silks.

162
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,524
And go with the monkey.

163
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,886
What?

164
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,521
Come on.

165
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,961
That's what I do.

166
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,540
Thank you for your patronage...

167
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,340
and for your unwavering support
of this fine institution.

168
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,723
This newly renovated planetarium
will serve as a lens...

169
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,180
"Once more unto the breach,
dear friends!"

170
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,005
What?

171
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,380
Charge!

172
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,180
Rough Riders!

173
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,580
- It's okay! Just hang on!
- Is this part of it?

174
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,300
Sorry folks, a little technical issue.
What are you doing?

175
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,140
Stick to the script. Stick to the script!

176
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,363
- It's me!
- I don't know you.

177
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,060
Pull!

178
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,820
I don't know what's come
over me, but I like it!

179
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,900
Drop 'em!

180
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,580
Yeah! Yeah!

181
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,725
What's going on?

182
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,565
Do something!

183
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,220
What are you doing?

184
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,641
Orion, don't!

185
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,601
Rexy!

186
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,765
Guys, what was going on out there?

187
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,620
Seriously, what were you thinking?

188
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,140
Laaa, I got this, all right?

189
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,363
Just... Go over there.

190
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,060
No, go over there.

191
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,361
Go.

192
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,807
Attila...

193
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,060
what were you doing
to that dolphin, man?

194
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,180
It's a dolphin!

195
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,060
It's one of the most
peaceful creatures on earth...

196
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,967
and you're hacking into it like
it was The Cove or something.

197
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,100
Did you see the look
on Regis Philbin's face?

198
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,140
Reeju?

199
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,660
Yeah, Reeju.

200
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,060
Teddy, what were you doing
pointing a gun at me?

201
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,420
Forgive me, Lawrence.
I don't know what came over me.

202
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,131
Do you even remember that?

203
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,340
Not at all.

204
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,340
Laaa, shut that down!
It's a defibrillator.

205
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,051
Put it down. It's dangerous!

206
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,820
Laaa, that's electricity.
Those aren't headphones.

207
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,645
Stop it!

208
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,740
Oh! Hey! Whoa! Dexter!

209
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,980
What are you doing?

210
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,660
Honestly, if you're gonna
act like a baby,

211
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,900
then I'll get you some diapers.

212
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,326
You want diapers again?

213
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,180
Ease up on the reins there, hoss.
Can't you see? He feels terrible!

214
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,820
Hell, we all do!

215
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,460
I don't know what's going on
with everybody here...

216
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,020
but tonight was really weird.
Really weird.

217
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,401
We feel awful.

218
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,020
Something took hold of us
like an evil spell!

219
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,482
Yeah, like we just weren't ourselves.

220
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,300
- Hello?
- Larry.

221
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,820
Hey, Dr. McPhee.

222
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,270
Yeah, hi. How's it going?

223
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,500
Okay.

224
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,620
Good, good, good, good, good, good.

225
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,689
You know that sound of when
you're hiding in a trash bin...

226
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,140
fearing for your life because a Tyrannosaurus
rex is using it as a Hacky Sack?

227
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,500
No. I don't know that sound.

228
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,724
You don't know that sound?
Oh, hold on one second.

229
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,940
That's the sound! That's the sound!
It will haunt my dreams!

230
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,380
I'm sorry. Look, really, I'm sorry.

231
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,820
I swear to you, I had no idea
this was going to happen.

232
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,820
"I had no idea it was gonna happen.

233
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,820
"I'm only in charge of
all the special effects."

234
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,780
It was your fault!
They were your special effects!

235
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,900
- No, I know.
- That's a joke.

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,900
"Special effects"? More like "special...

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,824
"defects!"

238
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:37,860
Look, I promise you,
I'm gonna find out what happened.

239
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,980
- Or they were "special rejects!"
- I'm sorry, Dr. McPhee. I gotta go.

240
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,665
Hey! Nicky! Nicky! Stop hopping!

241
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,900
- Dad, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

242
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,580
It's 3:00 AM.

243
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,180
All right, party's over!

244
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,925
- Hey.
- Hey.

245
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,420
Who are you?

246
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,780
- I'm Sophie.
- Sophie?

247
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,900
Bye Bye Birdie?

248
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,340
- Right.
- It was good.

249
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,500
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

250
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,700
See you tomorrow night?

251
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,940
- Probably not.
- Probably.

252
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,287
Definitely not.

253
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,730
Bye.

254
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,540
You're in so much trouble.

255
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,444
I know.

256
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,060
I didn't really know
you were coming home early.

257
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,380
Yeah, that's pretty obvious.

258
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,841
I mean...

259
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,860
what makes you think this is okay?

260
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,340
When I'm not at Mom's
you leave me alone, like, every night.

261
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,220
Look, you can't be doing this right now.

262
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,980
You got finals, your NYU application
is due in what, two weeks?

263
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,441
I'm not gonna get into NYU.

264
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,940
- You don't know that.
- No, I do.

265
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,220
You don't know that.

266
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,205
I do very much know that,
in the sense that I don't intend to apply.

267
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,300
What?

268
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,820
I don't think that it's the place
for me right now, Dad.

269
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,460
Okay. All right, fine.
You want to spread your wings a little...

270
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,740
get out of the city,
go to school somewhere else.

271
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,140
I totally support that.
All you had to do was tell me.

272
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,300
Where do you want to go?

273
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,300
- What's the list?
- It's a short list.

274
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,500
Great. I like it. Focus.

275
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,620
I'mma hit you with a super short list,
man, because it's...

276
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,285
There's nothing on it.

277
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,700
There's...

278
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,820
I'm confused,
because there's not a list...

279
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,121
Dad?

280
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,100
I want to take a year off.

281
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,020
I would like to do exactly
what you just said.

282
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,740
I want to spread my wings.

283
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,140
You want to spread your wings,
that's great.

284
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,700
But you can't spread your wings
and fly to nowhere.

285
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,650
- Plans change.
- No, they don't.

286
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,300
No, they don't. Plans don't change.

287
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,620
We had a plan, it changed.

288
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,100
- It's disorienting at first.
- No.

289
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,380
You can't change the plan...

290
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,420
unless you check with the people
who are financing the plan...

291
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,165
which is, last time I checked,
your mother and I. Okay?

292
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,300
Dad, we could sit here and just have
this conversation about plans...

293
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,860
but for now, let's call it a night.

294
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,460
Let's not even clean up, right?

295
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,700
Let's come back tomorrow.

296
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,540
Let's reboot the whole energy,
the whole tone of this puppy...

297
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,620
and we'll kill it, man.

298
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,340
Team Daley! Not tonight, tomorrow.

299
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,500
Hey, Team Daley?

300
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,540
- Yeah?
- Stop talking.

301
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,700
Okay.

302
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,140
You're gonna clean up.
I'm gonna go to bed.

303
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,920
And then we're gonna finish
this conversation tomorrow.

304
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,060
Yeah! Get some!

305
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,361
Get some!

306
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,363
That's it. Yeah.

307
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,206
Hi.

308
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,420
I'm Larry Daley.
I'm head of the Night Program.

309
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,420
I know who you are.
You're the security guard.

310
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,324
Yeah, also head of the Night Program.

311
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,940
I'm doing some research...

312
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,260
and I was wondering
if you could help me out.

313
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,420
Night guard doing research.

314
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,210
Ooh la-la!

315
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,500
Yeah.

316
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,980
I'm just looking for anything

317
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,860
that you might have on
the tablet of Ahkmenrah.

318
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,060
Center aisle.

319
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,460
- Great.
- Halfway down, stacks on your left.

320
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,487
Get it!

321
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,060
So...

322
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,727
what makes you so curious
about the tablet?

323
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,571
Oh! Just...

324
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,340
Just a hobby, you know?
Kind of an interest of mine.

325
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,860
I wish I could talk to these guys.

326
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,460
Well, you can't.

327
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,540
Yeah.

328
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,980
Because they're dead.

329
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,100
Right.

330
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,460
But, look at that one.

331
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,125
Looks like a kid?

332
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,605
You didn't know him, did you?

333
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,060
C.J Fredericks.

334
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,771
He worked here.

335
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,700
- He worked here?
- Yeah, when he grew up.

336
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,940
- No.
- Yeah.

337
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,900
He was a night guard.

338
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,531
Same as you.

339
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,528
Wait a minute. C.J.

340
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,129
C.J Fredericks.

341
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,700
Cecil Fredericks?

342
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,540
Sexiest night guard we ever had.

343
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,540
Present company included.

344
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,922
Boy, could that man move.

345
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,580
Larry?

346
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,881
Hey, Cecil.

347
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,740
My God, it's been years!

348
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,340
You look like you're doing pretty good.

349
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,420
I've still got it, pal.

350
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,780
What are you doing here?

351
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,420
I need to talk to you about the tablet.

352
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,529
What the heck is Short Stack doing here?

353
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,460
Hey, Gus. You're looking well.

354
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,807
Reginald.

355
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,180
Are you here to frame us again?

356
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,900
Send us back to the slammer?

357
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,020
I didn't frame you.
You were actually stealing.

358
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,980
And I was the one
that got you out of jail, so...

359
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,140
- Yeah.
- We've got a nice life here.

360
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,380
The past is the past. We've moved on.

361
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,700
I don't think this guy's moved on.

362
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,540
Listen to him, monkey face.

363
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,100
We've put all that
tablet stuff behind us, Larry.

364
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,380
It's old news.

365
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,340
Besides, we really never knew anything
about that old tablet.

366
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,780
We just worked there.

367
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,650
Something's up with it.

368
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,209
I told you, I can't help you.

369
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,731
Maybe this kid can.

370
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,041
Maybe we'd better talk alone.

371
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,740
Expedition like that is a
pretty amazing thing...

372
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,340
for a 12-year-old boy.

373
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,420
I tried to move on...

374
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,380
but there was something
about that tablet.

375
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,207
It's turning green,
like some sort of corrosion.

376
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,500
And something's happening
to Teddy and Dexter...

377
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,700
Jed and Octavius.

378
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,460
They're all acting weird.

379
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,161
It's like the green rust
is affecting them.

380
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,009
"The end will come."

381
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,241
What?

382
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,540
The locals, they warned us.

383
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,340
They begged us to leave that tomb alone.

384
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,723
I thought it meant the end of the world.

385
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,331
But maybe it meant the end...

386
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,860
End of the magic?

387
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,161
We should have listened.

388
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,380
Should have listened.

389
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,660
Instead, we shipped Ahk
and the tablet off to New York...

390
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,660
and his folks to England.

391
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,060
Wait. Wait.

392
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,980
Ahkmenrah's parents are in England?

393
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,980
It was a joint expedition.

394
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,420
Some of the artifacts stayed in Egypt.

395
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,486
The rest was divided up between
New York and the British Museum.

396
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,526
Ahk said that his father
knew the secrets of the tablet.

397
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,450
I think I have to go talk to him.

398
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,140
I need you to listen to me.

399
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,380
Our esteemed chairwoman
asked for my resignation.

400
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,820
She said, since the Night Program
was my brainchild...

401
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,540
that the buck starts and stops with me.

402
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,808
- I can fix it.
- How?

403
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,204
I need you to let me take the tablet
and Ahkmenrah to London.

404
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,140
Sorry. I'm just processing that.

405
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,020
Input data analysis.

406
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,620
I've just told you I'm being fired,

407
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,100
and the first thing you ask...

408
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,180
is if I'd allow you to take
some priceless artifacts...

409
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,540
away with you on holiday.

410
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,940
- Yes. Please.
- No way, José.

411
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm asking you to please
go with me on this.

412
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,860
- Nah.
- Please.

413
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,940
Can't do it, dude.

414
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,241
Bye.

415
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,820
- Are you gonna mug me?
- What?

416
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,420
I don't know. Just be prepared.

417
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,500
- I need you to listen to me.
- Oh.

418
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,580
- Okay?
- Yep.

419
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,380
- You want to know the truth?
- Go on.

420
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,808
Truth is, the tablet...

421
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,363
The tablet is actually magic.

422
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,280
Things really do come to life at night.

423
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,700
- It's special effects.
- It's not special effects.

424
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,820
How could it be special effects?

425
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,980
How could it not be special effects?

426
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,580
- Because it isn't!
- Of course it is!

427
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,020
- I'm telling you, this is what happens.
- What?

428
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,060
Sun goes down...

429
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,964
the tablet starts to glow...

430
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,569
everything comes to life.

431
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,700
- Sure.
- It's real.

432
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,260
"Tablet starts to glow."

433
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,260
Now I know you're mental.

434
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,700
Look, Leslie... Listen to me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

435
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,809
I know. Just...

436
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,641
What?

437
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,100
Listen, nobody cares about this place
as much as we do, right?

438
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,340
Yeah.

439
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,540
If you don't help me...

440
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,500
everything that's special
about it might stop...

441
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,500
and it may never come back.

442
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,401
I'm not asking you to understand,
I'm just asking you to trust me.

443
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,860
I'd like to help you...

444
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,606
but I don't even work here anymore.

445
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,125
British Museum doesn't know that.

446
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,326
The mummy and the tablet, both.

447
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,140
Classic conservation job...

448
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,940
under authority of me, of course...

449
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,060
the director of this museum,
which I still am.

450
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,691
Yep, okay.

451
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,601
You're in.

452
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,980
I really could have just stayed
by myself in New York.

453
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,460
Yeah. No, that wasn't gonna happen.

454
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,060
- Beautiful?
- Yeah.

455
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,500
The River Thames.

456
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,406
Isn't this cool, man,
you and me in London?

457
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,740
- Huh?
- Yeah.

458
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,761
Hey, I've been thinking
about that, year off.

459
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,081
Yeah?

460
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,760
I think it could be cool.

461
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,100
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

462
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,731
What are you thinking?

463
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,260
Yeah. Wow.

464
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,900
I think I want to DJ in Ibiza.

465
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,060
In Ibiza?

466
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,740
Ibiza, it's a small island
off the coast of Spain.

467
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,660
- Do you speak Spanish?
- No.

468
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,780
But that's the beautiful thing.
It's about the music.

469
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,923
It's not inhibited
by the language barrier.

470
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,820
No, but you are.

471
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,260
- Do you speak in beats?
- Why are you freaking out?

472
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,900
You just said this was
a really cool idea.

473
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,100
I'm not freaking out.

474
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,940
I just want to understand
what the plan is.

475
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,820
You didn't go to college.

476
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,168
Wait, now we're talking about
not going to college at all?

477
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,689
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Nicky.

478
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,660
Nicky. That's not...

479
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,620
Dad, you didn't go to college.
You turned out fine.

480
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,060
I turned out okay after about
20 years in a lot of dead ends.

481
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,780
Whatever, man.

482
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,980
Don't worry about me. It's fine.

483
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,620
Hey, I'm always gonna worry about you.

484
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,081
- I'm your dad.
- Thanks.

485
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,780
Sun is going down. We should get going.

486
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,081
All right.

487
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,140
Dad, what's the plan here, anyway?

488
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,780
When the tablet brings Ahkmenrah
to life, he's gonna sneak us in.

489
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,940
- Now, get down.
- What?

490
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,050
Just get down! Come on, man.
Part of the adventure.

491
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,420
Hello. Welcome to the British Museum.

492
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,580
My name's Tilly.

493
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,900
Hi. Thank you.

494
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,180
I'm Larry Daley from
Natural History, New York.

495
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,700
- Yeah, yeah.
- I got a delivery...

496
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,660
for your conservation department.

497
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,500
All right!

498
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,060
So they let you travel?

499
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,340
This is kind of unusual.

500
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,700
Well, they let me travel.
You know where?

501
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,322
- No.
- Home. Here. Home.

502
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,980
Back here.

503
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,820
Off to the toot-toot.

504
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,540
Five-minute maximum.

505
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,860
So that must be well wicked being
a security guard in America.

506
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,780
With your gun, with a silencer,
with your ninja swords.

507
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,081
Right.

508
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,780
That's not even a little bit true.

509
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,323
The only thing that I got is this.

510
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,860
- Oh.
- Hammer! It's for...

511
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,300
and I quote,
"minor repairs and beautifications"

512
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,860
to the shack.

513
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,564
You just hit things?

514
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,220
Yeah, that's catchy.

515
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,660
Basically worthless.

516
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,340
I can't believe
we're actually still talking.

517
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,140
- It's great, though, innit?
- It is.

518
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,980
This is the most conversation I've had

519
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,780
in the three years
that I've worked here.

520
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,740
I feel a connection, too.

521
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,060
Is it cool if I just make my drop?

522
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,900
- Oh, yeah.
- Wonderful.

523
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,700
But I will have to confirm.

524
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,060
Actually, that's not necessary...

525
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,020
because they've already confirmed
it on the slip I gave you.

526
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,860
Yeah, all right. Confirming.

527
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,500
- Okay.
- All right.

528
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,300
Hello. This is Dr. McPhee.

529
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,140
It's the British Museum, sir.

530
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,340
I'm just confirming a delivery
to our conservation department.

531
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,140
Yes, I signed the paperwork.

532
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,220
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a museum to run.

533
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,540
You, boy, get those grubby fingers
off my Ming vase.

534
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,410
See? Bye.

535
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,921
All right.

536
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,900
- Good?
- All right, you is legit.

537
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,540
I is legit.

538
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,220
- Wonderful.
- Confirm it.

539
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,780
- Thank you.
- All right, I'll open the gate.

540
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,860
Okay.

541
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,740
Yeah, so, like, my boyfriend...

542
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,620
he doesn't really like
the way I do my hair.

543
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,420
Says it looks like a golden poo
sitting on my shoulder.

544
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,722
But I really enjoy it.

545
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,164
Bye, Larry!

546
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,340
I'm not an expert...

547
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,140
but this is feeling, just,
really against the law.

548
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,886
No, they have a totally
different legal system here.

549
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,380
Okay.

550
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,500
How we doing?

551
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,660
All clear.

552
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,220
All right, let's go.

553
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,460
Larry, the others felt, perhaps,
we could use some help.

554
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,761
The others?

555
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,780
Lawrence, I couldn't sit idly by.

556
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,500
Our very survival is at stake.

557
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,540
All right. Hey, Teddy. Good.

558
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,524
Good man to have in a crisis.

559
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,286
Attila.

560
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,801
Okay, a little muscle.

561
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,420
Hi, Larry.

562
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,140
That is a deceptively large box.

563
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,300
Obviously, we came along, too!

564
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,380
You know you'd be lost
without us, Gigantor.

565
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,820
Are you serious?

566
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,243
And the monkey.
All right, basically everyone.

567
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,420
Dada!

568
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,688
Oh! No, no.

569
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,971
No possible benefit whatsoever.

570
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,620
He really wanted to come.

571
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,860
Yeah, this is my son...

572
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,650
my actual son, Nicky.

573
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,900
- Nicky, this is Laaa.
- What's up?

574
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,300
He's just tracking me.

575
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,946
Laaa.

576
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,860
So, Lawrence what's the plan of attack?

577
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,925
We need to get to the Egyptian wing,
find Ahk's father...

578
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,768
and hopefully get the tablet fixed.

579
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,285
All of us.

580
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,900
Laaa, that's not for eating.
That's not food.

581
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,247
Don't...

582
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,140
You know what? I got a job for you.

583
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,521
Come on, come on.

584
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,940
Come on.

585
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,940
I want you to stay here
and watch this door, okay?

586
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,460
Make sure nobody comes in or out. Okay?

587
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,340
Good. You're gonna be a guard,
just like me.

588
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,965
All right.

589
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,740
No. Come here.

590
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,420
Stay here...

591
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,620
and put your hands on the door.

592
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,820
- Good, stay.
- Stay!

593
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,700
Good. That's right. You stay here.

594
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,060
Stay here.

595
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,600
Stay. Right.

596
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,740
No. Stay.

597
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,246
- Stay!
- Stay.

598
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,940
Look there. Good. Stay.

599
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,780
No. Good. Stay.

600
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,260
No. Stay.

601
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,540
Stay!

602
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,180
Don't... Don't move.

603
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,220
Don't move.

604
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,682
No. Good. Okay.

605
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,340
Okay, listen up, guys.

606
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,980
This place is waking up
for the first time...

607
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,921
and we have no idea what's out there,
so stay together, all right?

608
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,180
I know it's spooky, big guy.

609
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,369
Just stay close.

610
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,926
What kind of haunted
hootenanny is this, boys?

611
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,681
We're all finding this
super creepy, right?

612
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,860
They're just a little freaked out.

613
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,323
First time we came alive
it took some getting used to.

614
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,169
Hey, there. Just heading to Egypt.

615
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,449
Come on. This way.

616
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,540
Hear that?

617
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,001
Hear what?

618
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,841
That.

619
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,740
We'll just be down here
if anyone needs us.

620
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,180
We're not scared.
It's just more comfortable.

621
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,420
Lawrence...

622
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,370
I think it's safe to say that
we're in a bit of trouble.

623
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,020
I know how to handle this guy.

624
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,560
You mind?

625
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,321
- Thanks.
- Dad, what are you doing?

626
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,206
How do you think I tamed your pal Rexy?

627
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,201
Hi, there.

628
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,820
I bet you're not so mean, are you?

629
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,780
I bet you're not so mean.

630
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,401
No, you're just a little puppy, right?

631
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,260
You're just a little puppy
who wants to play.

632
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,100
You want to play?

633
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,260
Want to play fetch?

634
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,460
Yeah?

635
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,140
You want to play with this bone?

636
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,220
Yeah!

637
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,602
Here you go. Go fetch.

638
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,361
Go fetch!

639
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,540
- Lawrence?
- Yeah?

640
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,922
- May I suggest a different plan?
- What?

641
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:08,650
Run!

642
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,649
Close it, close it!

643
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,527
Okay. I think we're...

644
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,968
Get back! Everybody, get back!

645
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,780
All right. You don't want to fetch?

646
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,420
- Fetch on this.
- What?

647
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,500
Oh! Oh!

648
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,211
- Oh, that's close!
- Need some help?

649
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,971
- What?
- Move.

650
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,561
Attila, you okay?

651
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,003
- You might want to...
- No.

652
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,566
Here hold this.

653
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,608
That was actually very cool.

654
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,140
Sir Lancelot, at your service.

655
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,965
Thank you. That was amazing.

656
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,220
Theodore Roosevelt...

657
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,380
President of the United
States of America.

658
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,260
I have no idea what that means.

659
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,860
I'm Larry, and this is my son, Nick.

660
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,500
You have a noble face, Nick.

661
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,740
- Thanks.
- Thanks for the help.

662
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,041
Now, you...

663
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,100
You remind me of a man
I once knew at Camelot.

664
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,340
Really?

665
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,460
One of the Knights of the Round Table?

666
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,700
No, Erik.

667
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,001
Erik?

668
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,020
Our fool.

669
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,380
He was the funniest fool I ever met.

670
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,500
He was so good,
he didn't even have to do anything.

671
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,320
He could just walk
into a room and you'd laugh.

672
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,660
- You have what he had. The gift.
- That's weird.

673
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,660
- You could be a fool.
- I don't know about that.

674
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,980
Oh, come on, of course you could!

675
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,171
We'd get you one of those hats
with the funny little dangly bells.

676
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,500
Dangly bells?

677
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,060
"Dangly bells."

678
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,980
Didn't I tell you? The gift.

679
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,260
He does what seems like nothing.

680
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,780
A sort of deadpan...

681
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,180
tiny little...

682
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,340
"Hmm." "Hmm."

683
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,620
Expressionless, you know, sort of a...

684
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,900
"Hmm. Hmm."

685
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,060
sort of thing.

686
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,620
Just like Erik.

687
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,060
Sounds like a great guy.
We got to get going, so...

688
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,260
Camelot.

689
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,380
Okay.

690
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,729
Someday, I shall return
to its mighty towers...

691
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,440
to King Arthur...

692
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,340
and Queen Guinevere.

693
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,500
Sweet...

694
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,484
beauteous Guinevere.

695
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,460
But I'm sworn not to until
I have completed my quest.

696
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,331
I must find the Holy Grail.

697
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,100
Well, good luck with that.

698
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,420
And thanks for the help again.

699
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,100
We got to get to Egypt,
so we'll see you.

700
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,607
- I will lead you.
- No, it's okay.

701
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,180
Halt, Dangly Bells!

702
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,060
There is strange magic in the air,
and dangerous beasts are afoot.

703
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,100
It is the duty of a true knight...

704
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,740
to protect and care for those in need.

705
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,041
We're off.

706
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,649
I guess he's coming with us.

707
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,046
Larry!

708
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,650
Jed and Octavius?

709
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,940
They must have fallen out
while we were running.

710
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,060
Jed?

711
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,885
Octavius!

712
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,851
Jedediah!

713
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,005
- Jed!
- Octo!

714
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,520
Oh, no.

715
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,366
Is that Octavius's cape?

716
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,761
Here.

717
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,291
- Nicky.
- Yeah.

718
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,241
Guys?

719
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,580
Gigantor!

720
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,020
Jed?

721
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,300
They won't last long in those
heating vents, Lawrence.

722
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,924
At their size, they'll bake like
tiny little scarabs in the Sinai.

723
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,160
Too dark?

724
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,100
This is the end, boy!

725
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,846
This is the last roundup!

726
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,250
Hold my hand!

727
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,010
Why?

728
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,485
Never mind.

729
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,600
We're a long way from home, boy.

730
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,881
Did you ask me to hold your hand?

731
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,201
No.

732
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,485
Jedo!

733
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,045
Octo!

734
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,880
They could be anywhere between
here and the intake vent.

735
00:40:00,744 --> 00:40:02,180
What do you see, Dex?

736
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,580
You know he's a monkey, Lawrence.

737
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,927
He can't talk.

738
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,440
No, but he can fit.

739
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,248
Nicky... give me your phone.

740
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,004
- Why?
- For Dex.

741
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,100
I don't understand one thing
that's going on here.

742
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,971
I don't, either. Dad, what's going on?

743
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,900
I'm sort of set up to track your phone.

744
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,380
You're sort of set up to track my phone?
You track my phone?

745
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,100
Yeah, I'm your dad.
I'm looking out for you.

746
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,300
No. No. Hold up.

747
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,100
"Spying on" is not the same thing
as just looking out for someone.

748
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,500
You'll get it back, I promise.

749
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,140
But right now,
it's going on the monkey's back.

750
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,930
All right. Dex, come here.

751
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,205
Thanks, man.

752
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,860
Listen. I need you to go down there
and find them, all right?

753
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,330
Think you can handle it?

754
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,940
Good man.

755
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,287
Stay safe.

756
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,780
I think it's right here.

757
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,780
"Right here."

758
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,366
Classic.

759
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,660
The gift of laughter.

760
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,928
Thank you, Dangly Bells.

761
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,606
First quest?

762
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,380
Not exactly.

763
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,100
I thought you were going to Egypt.

764
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,060
We are, but we got to do this first.

765
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,500
That's not how a quest works.

766
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,725
A quest is one thing. It's not,
like, "Holy Grail and a monkey."

767
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,561
Yeah, well, my guys are missing
and Dexter's gonna find them.

768
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,860
What is the quest? Gold?

769
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,420
Fountain of Youth?

770
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,500
Magic tablet.

771
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,723
It's that thing Ahk is holding.

772
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,860
It shouldn't be too hard
to take it from him.

773
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,889
He seems well-toned and lean...

774
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,540
but weak.

775
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,140
It would be like taking candy
from a feeble Egyptian baby.

776
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,020
No, we're not trying to take it,
we're trying to fix it.

777
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,780
There's something wrong with it.

778
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,580
It's kind of complicated.

779
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,660
It might be less complicated if you
stopped following a chimpanzee.

780
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,043
He's not a chimpanzee, he's a capuchin.

781
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,900
The fool seems agitated.

782
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,406
That's often his way.

783
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,250
But I assure you, he's no fool.

784
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,940
Is it true what he says?

785
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,820
The tablet that you carry is magic?

786
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,360
It is, indeed.

787
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,260
Everything around you has come to
life tonight for the very first time...

788
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,296
all because of this tablet.

789
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,290
Amazing.

790
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,420
Then they're not real?

791
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,540
They're as real as any of us.

792
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,380
Yes, but we're real people.

793
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,920
They're just things.

794
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,060
And they don't even know.

795
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,488
They must be unbelievably stupid.

796
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,180
It can be confusing at first.

797
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,180
Hello, frog!

798
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,500
Keep hopping!

799
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,900
You're real!

800
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,601
Guys, I think we're gonna
have to cut through Asia.

801
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,020
Not a clue.

802
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,446
None.

803
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,260
I can't really see much.

804
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,740
We could jump down, hope for the best.

805
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,420
But we have no idea what's down there.

806
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,721
We don't know what's up here, either.

807
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,489
This is a Roman city.

808
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,420
I can feel the familiar pull of history
in its very foundations.

809
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,768
Where the heck is everybody?

810
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,005
I've seen this town before,
I'm sure of it.

811
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,761
Romans?

812
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,042
I see you have the name
of a lady on your arm.

813
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,131
Andrea. Yeah.

814
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,684
So this Lady Andrea is your Guinevere.

815
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,441
Does any man stand
between you and your ladylove?

816
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,361
Yeah, actually. My dad kind of messed
things up the other night.

817
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,260
- Nick.
- Oh, we're stopping.

818
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,700
Let no man stand
between you and your destiny.

819
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,700
Oh, "destiny" may be
overstating it a bit.

820
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,340
We just have calculus together.

821
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,780
It's more one of those...

822
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,420
fleeting moments of eye contact.

823
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,660
"Who's gonna look away first?"

824
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,281
But I get you. No man...

825
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,685
- Good.
- Okay.

826
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,921
"Iiepwop."

827
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,849
Iiepwop.

828
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,180
Doesn't ring a bell.

829
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,580
Now who's this son of a gun?

830
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,700
- Pompeii!
- I'm sorry.

831
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,162
- I'm having trouble hearing you!
- Pompeii!

832
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,940
No comprendo, amigo...

833
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,860
because you got the thing
in front of you!

834
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,730
What are they doing?

835
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,020
Where in the blazes
are they stampeding off to?

836
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,300
Was it something we said?

837
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,540
Come on back to Iiepwop!

838
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,100
- There's plenty of room!
- Come on back!

839
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,900
They're as crazy as road lizards.

840
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,123
People are strange.

841
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,020
Hey, guy. We're just passing through.

842
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,420
- It's a Garuda from Tibet.
- A Garuda?

843
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,340
Hi, Garuda. How you doing?

844
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,660
Garuda! How you doing?

845
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,961
Cool, great.

846
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,571
Okay. We just...

847
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,882
You know what? We just got to get through.
I don't have time.

848
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,740
Please. Okay.

849
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,860
I'm not gonna play this game with you.

850
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,446
I got to go through. Really.

851
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,723
Get back.

852
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,242
- A dragon.
- No, it's not a dragon. It's a...

853
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,860
It's a Xiangliu.

854
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,940
Mythical snake demon.

855
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,060
It looks like a dragon.
I say we kill it.

856
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,169
What? No, it's asleep.

857
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,300
You're right. It's not very sporting
to kill it while it's asleep.

858
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,820
Let's wake it up and then kill it.

859
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,700
I shall go first,
and I shall take the boy.

860
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,740
What are you...? No!
You're not gonna take the boy.

861
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,883
- Why not?
- Because he's a boy!

862
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,540
Larry, there comes a time
in every man's life...

863
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,140
when he must slay his own dragon.

864
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,340
Not this kid, all right?

865
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,660
He still hasn't finished all his
thank-you notes from his bar mitzvah.

866
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,620
Anyway, that's just an expression.

867
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,740
Not where I come from.

868
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,740
He's not gonna
slay his dragon right now.

869
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,180
We're gonna go around it.

870
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,180
We're gonna go around now,
or else we're gonna lose the signal.

871
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,481
Come on.

872
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,180
Iiepwop.

873
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,620
Pompeii!

874
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,540
Iiepwop. Are you sure you're
reading that right, pal?

875
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,800
Pompeii!

876
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,860
"Pompeii."

877
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,244
"Ask not what your country can do for you...

878
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,251
"Ask what you can do for your country."

879
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,046
There it goes again!

880
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,540
Attila!

881
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,642
- Teddy!
- Charge!

882
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,681
Whoa!

883
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,967
Fantastic! It's awake!
Now we can kill it!

884
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,780
Whoa!

885
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,605
- Attila!
- Dad!

886
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,766
Nicky!

887
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,520
I'll get the boy!

888
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,620
- Ever used a blade?
- Only in World of Warcraft!

889
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,967
You're about to learn.

890
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,686
"The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself!"

891
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,486
"Doing a heck of a job, Brownie."

892
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,300
Behind you!

893
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,681
Duck!

894
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,540
Last roundup, kemosabe!

895
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,100
Time to slap on the barbecue sauce, boy!

896
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,401
What?

897
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,523
No, no! You wouldn't!

898
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,361
He must!

899
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,247
Clear!

900
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,371
We must never speak
of what happened here today.

901
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,060
Come on! That wasn't necessary!

902
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,180
It's out!

903
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,900
These things really do save lives.

904
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,721
Are you all right?

905
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,691
Are you all right, my dear?

906
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,248
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

907
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,681
You fought bravely, sire.

908
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,420
One day, I promise you,

909
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,722
we shall drink dragon's blood
from the victor's cup.

910
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,660
I'm good with just, like,
soda or water, too.

911
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,780
But I like the energy we got going.

912
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,651
From now on,
you must choose your own path.

913
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,004
And let no man tell you otherwise.

914
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,620
We better let Larry know we're okay.

915
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,160
Turn around.

916
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,166
Larry's probably worried about us.

917
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,202
How are we going to find them now?

918
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,886
Lawrence?

919
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,980
I fear we've turned a corner.

920
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,931
I'm becoming wax again, son.

921
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,260
All right. We'll look for them later.

922
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,244
We got to get to Egypt now.

923
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,340
Wait, shouldn't we keep looking
for Jed and Octavius?

924
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,660
Nick is right.

925
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,020
A true knight never shirks his duties.

926
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,529
If we don't get to Egypt soon
we're not gonna save anybody.

927
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,084
Dada say, "Stay!"

928
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,460
Stay!

929
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,851
Dada say Laaa no eat.

930
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,970
Stay, Laaa!

931
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,566
This is it.

932
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,180
Perhaps I should accompany you in.

933
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,260
No, I think we got it from here.

934
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,460
- Really?
- Yeah. No, we're good.

935
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,886
Right. Well...

936
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,060
friends...

937
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,140
Larry...

938
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,124
clown-faced keeper
of the magic tablet...

939
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,260
I shall never forget your bravery.

940
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,420
Nor your jests.

941
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,051
Bye.

942
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,580
I shall not say goodbye.

943
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,700
- I am.
- What?

944
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,260
I'm gonna say goodbye.
I have to go, I'm sorry.

945
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,641
I'll see you.

946
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,180
Really, man, thank you.

947
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,720
For everything.

948
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,724
I haven't seen these walls
for many a moon.

949
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,527
Ahkmen?

950
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,900
Mother.

951
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,050
Father.

952
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,209
Welcome home, my son.

953
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,528
I want you to meet my friends.

954
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,644
I am Merenkahre...

955
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,820
Pharaoh of the Nile and Father
to the Son of the Sun.

956
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,220
And I am Shepseheret...

957
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,000
the Glittering Jewel
of the Nine Kingdoms.

958
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,860
And I am Larry.

959
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,340
Guardian of Brooklyn.

960
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,540
Yes.

961
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,340
I actually live in Manhattan now.

962
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,380
I know, but it doesn't sound as cool.

963
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,620
Yeah.

964
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,540
We would be very honored if you
could take a look at the tablet.

965
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,700
There's something happening with it.

966
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,140
We don't understand what it is.

967
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,780
You are speaking with a pharaoh.

968
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,684
Kiss my staff.

969
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,340
Is it okay if I don't?

970
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,051
You will show respect.

971
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,620
I am the descendant of Ra, the sun god.

972
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,860
I understand that
and I totally respect you.

973
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,300
I just don't pray to Ra, so...

974
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,060
The Egyptian gods
are the only true gods.

975
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,980
Well, we try to stay
a little more open-minded.

976
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,860
I mean, Sacajawea,
she honors her spiritual ancestors...

977
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,540
and you pray to some sort
of goat god, Attila?

978
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,380
I'm half-Irish, half-Jewish...

979
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,489
You are? I love Jews!

980
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,420
We owned 40,000 of them!

981
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,780
- Such lovely people.
- Here we go.

982
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,500
They were very happy,
always singing with the candles.

983
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,860
Yeah. They really weren't happy.

984
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,900
- Really?
- No. They left.

985
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,780
They spent about 40 years
in the desert trying to escape.

986
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,660
Yeah. We have dinner once
a year and talk about it.

987
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,460
It's a big deal for us.

988
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,820
Listen, could you take
a look at that tablet?

989
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,963
There's something wrong with it.

990
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,006
It's losing its power.

991
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,562
Do you think you could fix it?

992
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,844
To do that, I would have to divulge
the secret of the tablet.

993
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,620
I promise we won't tell anybody.

994
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,921
No.

995
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,700
I'll kiss your staff.

996
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,001
Too late.

997
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,860
Father, why do you insist
on keeping this to yourself?

998
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,420
The secret was to be passed down
to you at the proper time.

999
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,420
Well, it has been 4,000 years.

1000
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,529
Now seems like a good time.

1001
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,729
You were born at midnight.

1002
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,700
I was Pharaoh...

1003
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,420
and I had seen wonders
most men only dream of.

1004
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,530
But when I first gazed upon you...

1005
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,100
you were instantly
more precious to me...

1006
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,607
than all the wonders
of the ancient world.

1007
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,926
I knew I could never bear
to say goodbye.

1008
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,060
I commanded the High Priest to create
a gift to you, my son...

1009
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,140
using all we had learned of
the mysteries of the afterlife.

1010
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,523
Forged in the temple of Khonsu,
god of the moon...

1011
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,049
and watcher over nighttime travelers...

1012
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,500
the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

1013
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,580
Our tomb was designed to channel
Khonsu's rays down to the tablet...

1014
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,500
rejuvenating its powers every night.

1015
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,380
The moon god bestowed
his power upon the tablet...

1016
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,340
so that, as long as
it bathed in his light...

1017
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,660
our family could be together forever,

1018
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,440
and not even death could part us.

1019
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,001
It's been away
from Khonsu's light too long.

1020
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,540
My son!

1021
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,729
What is happening to you?

1022
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,780
It needs moonlight...

1023
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,128
otherwise we shall all
be dead by sunrise.

1024
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,641
Hurry!

1025
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,700
If the tablet dies...

1026
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,411
nothing can bring it back!

1027
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,300
What are you doing?

1028
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,125
The tablet. Now.

1029
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,860
Wait, listen to me. That thing is dying.

1030
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,580
If it doesn't get moonlight...

1031
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,540
everything ends, like, for real.

1032
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,900
King Arthur wasted years searching
for the Holy Grail.

1033
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,700
To think it was a tablet all along.

1034
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,660
Would you just give it to me?
You don't know what you're doing!

1035
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,380
My quest is complete.

1036
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,820
I ride for Camelot tonight.

1037
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,300
Just keep it, okay?

1038
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,020
But just put it in the moonlight
and turn that center piece.

1039
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,085
Sorry, not my first quest.

1040
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,180
And by the way,
Erik was much funnier than you!

1041
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,140
Go get the others.

1042
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,442
We can't let him leave the building!

1043
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,940
Whoa! Easy there, partner! Slow it down!

1044
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,460
I don't know who you are...

1045
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,814
but I'm pretty dang sure
that tablet don't belong to you.

1046
00:59:12,214 --> 00:59:16,060
Now wait a second!
Come back here! This ain't over!

1047
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,980
You'll rue the day you
mocked us with your huge sword

1048
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,408
and hypnotic blue eyes!

1049
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,125
His eyes are very blue.

1050
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,964
Speak softly and carry a big stick.

1051
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,940
Lawrence, we have a problem.

1052
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,020
This one turned to wax as well.

1053
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,368
I have a saying, too.

1054
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,411
"Speak loudly and carry a bigger stick."

1055
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,140
- It's over there!
- You mean up there.

1056
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,601
Come on.

1057
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,487
Got it.

1058
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,940
- Teddy.
- The tablet, now!

1059
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,180
I shan't ask you again, fool!

1060
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,740
And this is giving me a headache!

1061
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,620
Give me the tablet!

1062
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,921
Let me go, Lawrence.

1063
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,730
No! Teddy, no!

1064
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,881
Teddy!

1065
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,761
There.

1066
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,805
That'll be mine.

1067
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,100
Hey, that was a good one.

1068
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,640
No idea that would work.

1069
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,700
Larry!

1070
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,740
Hey, you guys, how you doing?

1071
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,980
Still in one piece!

1072
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,220
- Octavius, I think this belongs to you.
- Thank you.

1073
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,460
I don't understand.

1074
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,740
Why is Lancelot staying strong
while we get weaker?

1075
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,940
It's his first night.

1076
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,620
Newborns are stronger
but it matters not.

1077
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,500
Unless we succeed, he, too,
will be dead come the dawn.

1078
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,700
We can't let him leave the building.

1079
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,660
Sir, can you go back to Egypt,
in case he comes through there?

1080
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,580
- Of course.
- Nicky, take Attila, check the loading dock.

1081
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,740
- Got it.
- Teddy, go to the South Wing, cover the side doors.

1082
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,485
I got the main entrance.

1083
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,340
You! I knew you smelled a bit off!

1084
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,820
- Didn't you just see that?
- See what?

1085
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,460
The knight on the horse
that just rode through!

1086
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,860
Stop trying to distract me
with your magical fantasy!

1087
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,362
I found your filthy twin, here,
in the freight room!

1088
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,540
He's not my twin.

1089
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,900
I got him, and what could
he say for himself?

1090
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,060
Shut up! Shut up in your face!

1091
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,044
Shut up right now!
Do you want to be smashed?

1092
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,700
Yeah, you can run,
but if you leave those gates...

1093
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,980
I swear to you,
your hideous doppelganger...

1094
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,580
who looks a lot like the lead singer
of the Counting Crows...

1095
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,006
will get it!

1096
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,540
Dada.

1097
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,700
That's right.

1098
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,764
It compute with him.

1099
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,931
Dada.

1100
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,740
Damn it!

1101
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,860
Laaa.

1102
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,050
If you see me do something dumb,
don't imitate me, okay?

1103
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,721
It's basically what I keep telling Nick.

1104
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,848
He just doesn't get it, you know?

1105
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,780
I mean, he's a smart kid...

1106
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,811
but I just want to give him
the tools that I didn't have.

1107
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,340
I mean, get the degree,
then take a break.

1108
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,420
Get the degree, then take a break.

1109
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,420
Laaa! Laaa, stop that!

1110
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,926
Stop it!

1111
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,081
Okay.

1112
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,060
What? Excuse me! Hey!

1113
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,900
Hi. Hey. Sorry.

1114
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,380
I'm Nick, this is Dexter,
Attila the Hun.

1115
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,980
Oh, yes, so lovely to meet you.

1116
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,566
Now meet this hammer!

1117
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,891
Don't do that.

1118
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,900
I'm super sorry. I know it's
a lot going on, Hun, monkey.

1119
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,820
Wow, what? So much weird.
Huge amount to process.

1120
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,420
Right? Okay, sorry.

1121
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,340
- Thank you.
- You won't get away with this!

1122
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,500
I'm making sketches of you
in my mind right now!

1123
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,300
Boy with freckles,

1124
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,968
fat Asian with hair extensions,
evil monkey.

1125
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,245
I guess it's just parenting, you know?

1126
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,980
And he comes from a divorced family...

1127
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,860
so I'm sure he has a lot of conflicted
feelings about me...

1128
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,700
and there might be some
Oedipal stuff at play in there, or...

1129
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,860
I get it.

1130
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,180
I wasn't there a lot of the time.

1131
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,460
So I think I might be
projecting my own guilt...

1132
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,180
and taking it out on him in ways...

1133
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,060
that I'm not even aware of.

1134
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,161
What?

1135
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,000
Door.

1136
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,641
Head.

1137
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,300
Okay, I...

1138
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,760
Open...

1139
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,620
head.

1140
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,380
Open your mind!

1141
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,140
Yes! Yeah, well, you're right.

1142
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,380
That's the challenge.

1143
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,900
I mean, it's all contextual, and I do.

1144
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,740
I keep looking at him through the lens
of how my parents raised me...

1145
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,060
when, in reality, he's his own person.

1146
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,380
And, yeah, we share the same DNA...

1147
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,060
but honestly, he's much more
evolved than I ever was.

1148
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,900
I don't want to let my own ego
and childhood history...

1149
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,060
stop him from making the mistakes
he needs to make...

1150
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,780
to become the person
that he's meant to be.

1151
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,900
Open the door with your head.

1152
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,020
Yes!

1153
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,243
Good, Laaa. Let's go!

1154
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,580
- Everybody okay?
- Yes, Lawrence.

1155
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,940
Attila and your boy secured
the lady guard in her booth.

1156
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,660
I don't know how long
it will hold her, though.

1157
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,900
We gotta find Lancelot...

1158
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,884
but somebody has to make sure
she doesn't get out.

1159
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,900
Yeah. Laaa, okay.

1160
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,690
You know what you have to do?

1161
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,020
Stay!

1162
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,940
That's right. Just make sure
she stays in there.

1163
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,940
- Stay!
- Good! Go!

1164
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,685
Dada say, "Stay"!

1165
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,940
Lawrence!

1166
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,260
I can't move my arms.

1167
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,460
We're becoming less useful
by the minute.

1168
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,841
Whoa, whoa!

1169
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,925
Come on, big guy.

1170
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:10,206
What? You okay there?

1171
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,340
Something's up with your eye, but...

1172
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,700
I don't know. It's just kind of going...

1173
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,764
You gotta relax, okay?

1174
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,620
Calm down!

1175
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,140
Attila! Attila!

1176
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,609
Attila doesn't hyperventilate.

1177
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,287
You pillage!

1178
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,684
You plunder!

1179
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:35,635
You don't freak out. Okay?

1180
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,580
Dad, there's, like,
8 million people in this city.

1181
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,530
He could be literally anywhere by now.

1182
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,921
We'll find him.

1183
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,361
We have to.

1184
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,486
I'm coming, my love.

1185
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,801
Blimey!

1186
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,340
He came this way...

1187
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,340
traveling 4 leagues per hour.

1188
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:23,980
No!

1189
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,282
Never run from a big cat, Lawrence.

1190
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,404
Gigantor, get your flashlight out!

1191
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,689
These cats want to play!

1192
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,402
Whoo-wee! He's got it, boy!

1193
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,780
Well played, sir.

1194
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,320
Run!

1195
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,922
Where the devil could Lancelot be?

1196
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,801
Come on!

1197
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,660
You better let me out of here,
you revolting ape-man!

1198
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,220
What are you staring at?
Stop looking at me!

1199
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,540
Have you never seen a beautiful,
attractive, gorgeous woman before...

1200
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,580
who could be a model if she
didn't love pizza so much?

1201
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,340
I know what you're playing at...

1202
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,847
and it ain't working.

1203
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,365
Not working.

1204
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,488
Wait, it is kind of working.

1205
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,722
What have they done to Camelot?

1206
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,410
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot

1207
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:56,460
For happily ever-aftering

1208
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,220
Than here in...

1209
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,601
- Camelot
- At long last!

1210
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,380
- Guinevere, my love.
- Hi.

1211
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,047
Can I help you, mate?

1212
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,361
It is I...

1213
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,780
Sir Lancelot.

1214
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,620
I have fulfilled my quest.

1215
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,260
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1216
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,460
I'm not actually Guinevere.

1217
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,900
I'm Alice Eve, and I think
you got a bit confused.

1218
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,900
- Maybe you saw me on stage...
- Your voice is like music...

1219
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,820
but I have no idea what you're saying.

1220
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,380
Okay. Hey.

1221
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,940
Hey, man.

1222
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,446
Hey, buddy.

1223
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:30,740
What she's saying is she's not Guinevere
because she's an actor.

1224
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,740
Okay? So am I.

1225
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,980
An actor?

1226
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,140
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1227
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,500
You know?

1228
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,660
Do the crown.

1229
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,300
Oh, sorry, of course. Hugh Jackman.

1230
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,340
It was the crown.

1231
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,641
I know, the whole...

1232
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,740
Huge Ackman?

1233
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,340
That's a ridiculous name!

1234
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,660
It doesn't even sound real!

1235
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,180
Only a coward would conceal
his true identity, Arthur.

1236
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,660
No, it's Hugh Jackman.

1237
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,940
I, on the other hand...

1238
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,246
carry the treasure you sought
but could never find.

1239
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,860
Behold the key to life everlasting!

1240
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,460
Okay, I love the costume...

1241
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,660
I love the enthusiasm...

1242
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,540
but you're gonna have
to get off stage now.

1243
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,860
Sir Lancelot, ladies and gentlemen.
Sir Lancelot.

1244
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,060
Yes!

1245
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,260
Very good.

1246
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,289
Shame on you, Arthur!

1247
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,740
You don't deserve your crown,
and you don't deserve your queen!

1248
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,820
Prepare to feel the cold kiss
of my blade...

1249
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,020
Huge Ackman!

1250
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,700
Hey, buddy, this is all pretend.

1251
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,365
See, just...

1252
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,611
Well, that's not real.

1253
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,684
None of it is.

1254
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,820
It's not real.

1255
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,020
It was a good performance.

1256
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,860
- We were right in there.
- You were tonight.

1257
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,180
But it's not real-real.

1258
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,811
It's not real.

1259
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,125
Not real?

1260
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,580
Do you know how long
I dreamed of Camelot?

1261
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,161
And for what? For nothing!

1262
01:11:04,324 --> 01:11:06,740
- Jeez!
- Nothing!

1263
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,691
No, no, no.
Please just take your seats and...

1264
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,041
What's up?

1265
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,247
We're just as God made us.

1266
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,060
Why don't you take a picture?

1267
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,885
It'll last longer.

1268
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,580
Okay, I've tried being nice.
That's enough.

1269
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,540
Get off the stage right now!

1270
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,500
Stay back! You don't scare me...

1271
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,620
Huge Ackman.

1272
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,460
Listen, mate, you don't
want to fight me, all right?

1273
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,380
If we go, I will break you.

1274
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,140
Come on!

1275
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,740
What is that?

1276
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,900
What are you doing?

1277
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,020
- He's doing his Wolverine thing.
- Yeah.

1278
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,900
- Yeah.
- You know?

1279
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,780
It's better with the claws and no shirt.

1280
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,081
Fair.

1281
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,460
Lancelot!

1282
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,921
Lancelot!

1283
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,660
Oi, mate!

1284
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,380
Hey, buddy, that's not an exit!

1285
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,980
Yeah, come on up.

1286
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,580
Yep. Come on up!

1287
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:16,780
Oh, monkeys. Terrific.

1288
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,140
I love the costumes.

1289
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,420
Sorry. I just gotta say,
you're the whole package, man.

1290
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,801
Thanks, buddy.

1291
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,928
- He recognized you.
- Yeah, that was awesome.

1292
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,300
Hey! Give me the tablet!

1293
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,443
Stay back! Stay back.

1294
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,900
- Stand back!
- Whoa!

1295
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,281
Back!

1296
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,041
What?

1297
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,660
Your..

1298
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,340
- Your nose, it's...
- What about my nose?

1299
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,780
Your nose is dripping.

1300
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,805
- What?
- It's melting. From the fire.

1301
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,720
Okay.

1302
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,940
How bad is it?

1303
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,500
It is not great.

1304
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,860
But I'm Lancelot!

1305
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,020
There never was a Lancelot!

1306
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,300
Lancelot is a legend.

1307
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,020
You're not real.

1308
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,180
I don't understand!

1309
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,540
I know it's a lot to take in,
but please, just give me the tablet.

1310
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,860
Oh, and then what? Back to the museum?

1311
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,300
Stand there as little children
ogle and point?

1312
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,681
And learn.

1313
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,140
And get inspired to do great things.

1314
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,220
There are far less noble fates,
my friend.

1315
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,860
Not for me, there aren't!

1316
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,820
If there is no Camelot...

1317
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,380
there is no Guinevere and no Lancelot...

1318
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,700
then I'm nothing.
I'm just a sad lump of misshapen wax.

1319
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,300
Stop looking at my nose!

1320
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,011
- I wasn't looking at it.
- You were, I saw you.

1321
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,900
You were like this. "Hmm, hmm." Staring.

1322
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,140
- I wasn't like that.
- You were!

1323
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,220
Don't look at it!

1324
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,340
It really is hard not to look at.

1325
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,369
Yes, he is.

1326
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,220
- I didn't.
- I saw you!

1327
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,980
- No, I'm looking at your eyes.
- Monkey, stop it!

1328
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,860
Could you give me the tablet, please?
Give me the tablet.

1329
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,140
If you give me the tablet,
I promise I won't...

1330
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,380
Do not look at my nose!

1331
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,900
- Give me the tablet.
- Look away.

1332
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,580
- Give me the tablet.
- How hard could it be not to look at my nose?

1333
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,180
I'm not gonna look at your nose.

1334
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,801
- I can't help it!
- Look to the heavens!

1335
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,740
It's disgusting.

1336
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,420
Yet, he's still handsome.

1337
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:03,726
No one shall look at, or mention,
my nose from this moment forward!

1338
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,580
I'm sorry, I forgot
what we were talking about.

1339
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,447
Lawrence.

1340
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,401
Oh, Teddy!

1341
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:21,841
Larry.

1342
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,889
We've run out of time.

1343
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,620
Listen to me.
You got to straighten the pieces.

1344
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,780
Straighten the pieces right now
or they're all gonna die!

1345
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:31,860
You too!

1346
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,891
A world without Camelot is not
a world worth living in.

1347
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,447
Dad!

1348
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,566
Dexter, what is it?

1349
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,881
You all right?

1350
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,001
Hey.

1351
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,620
Hey, man, you okay?

1352
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,524
Hey, look at me.

1353
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,820
Yeah, you want to slap me? Go ahead.

1354
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,690
Go ahead, slap me in the face.

1355
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,241
Dex?

1356
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,127
Dexter?

1357
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,601
Dexter?

1358
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,820
Oh! No, no. No.

1359
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,340
Dexter? No, no. Come on, man!

1360
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,244
Dad, he's gone.

1361
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,962
I'll take that hand now.

1362
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,320
I understand now.

1363
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,020
The monkey was the quest.

1364
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,084
It was never about the tablet.

1365
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,651
It was about them.

1366
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,640
Forgive me.

1367
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,643
It is I who have been the fool.

1368
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,580
We're back, baby!

1369
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:18,881
Lawrence!

1370
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,580
Whoa!

1371
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,820
Hey!

1372
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,220
Welcome back, buddy.

1373
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,006
Hey.

1374
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,500
Well done, Larry!

1375
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,340
There he is. That's our guy.

1376
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,846
Come here!

1377
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,900
Here's your tablet.

1378
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,220
It feels good, doesn't it, Jedediah?

1379
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,010
Boy, you said it!

1380
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,970
Hey. Thank you.

1381
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,251
How do I look?

1382
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,924
You look like Lancelot.

1383
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,607
Well done, my child.

1384
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,241
Thank you...

1385
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,281
for bringing my son home safely.

1386
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,609
It's a strange thing...

1387
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,380
seeing your boy become a man.

1388
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,060
There were lions chasing us.

1389
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,125
Yeah, it's crazy.

1390
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,300
One day, they're riding a dinosaur
through Central Park...

1391
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:49,571
and then the next day
they're DJ-ing in Ibiza.

1392
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,442
You've served my family well.

1393
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,940
We shall build a great tomb
and bury you with many riches.

1394
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,460
I, personally, will see to it
that your organs are removed...

1395
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,491
and placed in separate
jewel-encrusted jars.

1396
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,441
Thank you.

1397
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,406
It's the right thing to do.

1398
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,180
Then we're agreed.

1399
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,500
Lawrence...

1400
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,740
may I have a word?

1401
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,140
Yeah.

1402
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,500
The others and I have been talking.

1403
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,282
Ahkmenrah's place
is here with his family.

1404
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,801
He must remain here.

1405
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,460
And the tablet should
stay here as well, son.

1406
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:30,604
This is where it belongs, Gigantor.

1407
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,445
Yeah, but it...

1408
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,260
That means you guys would have to stay.

1409
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,780
We belong in New York.

1410
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,620
Yeah, but if you...

1411
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,809
If you guys go, then you...

1412
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,449
you won't be alive after tonight.

1413
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,460
We're museum exhibits, Laredo.

1414
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,841
It's what we are.

1415
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,483
Folks come to look at us,
maybe learn a little something.

1416
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,684
That's alive, man.

1417
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,380
But I'm...

1418
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,140
I'm supposed to take care of you guys.

1419
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,680
And you have.

1420
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,444
It's okay, Lawrence.

1421
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,326
We're ready.

1422
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,525
I'm not.

1423
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,485
Let us go, son.

1424
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:21,967
Okay.

1425
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,409
Thank you for giving me
back my family, Larry...

1426
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,049
Guardian of Brooklyn.

1427
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,420
Dad, if we leave right now,
we can still catch a flight...

1428
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,060
get home with everyone still awake
before the sun comes up.

1429
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,725
Yeah, okay.

1430
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,049
Let's go home.

1431
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:46,780
Whoa!

1432
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,100
It's all right, Larry.

1433
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,100
We've reached something
of an understanding.

1434
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,721
- Really?
- Trixey, sit.

1435
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,380
Wow! That's really good.

1436
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,900
Good job, Lance.

1437
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,247
Thanks.

1438
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,886
Trixey, behave.

1439
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,247
Good girl.

1440
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,921
Steady.

1441
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,380
He never even listens to me.

1442
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,820
But you...

1443
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:16,100
I just feel like
you really listen to me.

1444
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:21,610
It's like our hearts are in
perfect sync with each other right now.

1445
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,660
Do you feel what...

1446
01:20:23,772 --> 01:20:26,524
Hi. Sorry to interrupt whatever...

1447
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,700
is happening.

1448
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,765
Laaa, the guys are waiting outside.
We gotta go. Come on.

1449
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,500
What? No.

1450
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,060
No! Laaa, stay!

1451
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,980
I know this sounds crazy...

1452
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,601
but you and I could make a life
together here in England.

1453
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,281
Whoa!

1454
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,521
Wow. Okay.

1455
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,004
I will never forget you.

1456
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,648
You are the most rugged man
that I have ever, ever met.

1457
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,740
Keep the scrunchies.

1458
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,486
Okay, Laaa. We gotta go.

1459
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,041
Come on.

1460
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,091
I won't say anything if you won't.

1461
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:38,208
Oh, I know you hate this job and
everything, but tomorrow night...

1462
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,889
best job ever.

1463
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,940
Sure is quiet around here.

1464
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,449
Without the tablet,
it's just like any other museum.

1465
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,807
You know what I'm gonna remember
most about you?

1466
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,400
What?

1467
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,248
How big you guys are.

1468
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,566
Come here.

1469
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,241
Come here.

1470
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,684
Hold me.

1471
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,410
My...

1472
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,450
friend.

1473
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,684
You speak English?

1474
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,525
Okay.

1475
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,770
Hey, listen.

1476
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,444
Up there on the roof, when...

1477
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,771
When you almost...

1478
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,170
Yeah.

1479
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,260
I just want you to know...

1480
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,540
I really changed my perspective
on everything.

1481
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,683
I know we have a weird...

1482
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,681
We have this dynamic,
we have this tension.

1483
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,420
Back and forth.

1484
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,529
I mean, games, right? You know?

1485
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,961
Roles that we put ourselves into,
but why does it have to be that way?

1486
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,660
I feel like there's always been a mutual

1487
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,645
sort of respect for each other.

1488
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,891
Anyway.

1489
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,209
I'll miss you, you know?

1490
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,700
Okay. It's all right.

1491
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,889
Go ahead. One last slap.

1492
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:28,923
Yeah, I felt that was there
for a long time, too.

1493
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,201
Thank you.

1494
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,580
Who would have ever thought?

1495
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,804
I'm wax, she's polyurethane.

1496
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,122
But somehow, it worked.

1497
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,580
I guess this is it.

1498
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:14,940
Indeed.

1499
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:18,403
And I know young Nick
will do great things.

1500
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,285
Yeah, he's...

1501
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,180
ready to take on the world
all by himself.

1502
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,403
Then you've done your job.

1503
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,163
You've done your job.

1504
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,688
It's time for your next adventure.

1505
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,483
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do tomorrow.

1506
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,082
How exciting.

1507
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,125
Bye, Teddy.

1508
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,449
Farewell, Lawrence.

1509
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,500
Bully!

1510
01:25:59,575 --> 01:26:00,609
Got you!

1511
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,963
Smile, my boy.

1512
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,289
It's sunrise.

1513
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,380
- Hey.
- Hey. You good?

1514
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:34,047
- Yeah, I am.
- Good.

1515
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,961
So, Ibiza?

1516
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,041
Yeah.

1517
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,410
The whole DJ thing, Dad...

1518
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,500
I don't know if that's
the thing for me...

1519
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,700
I just know that it's the next thing.

1520
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,620
After that, maybe college.

1521
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:55,481
I'm figuring it all out, you know?

1522
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,161
Sounds like a plan.

1523
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,540
I should get back to Mom's,
or something.

1524
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,171
Okay.

1525
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,721
I love you.

1526
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,010
I love you, too.

1527
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,681
All right.

1528
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,540
I'm not gonna let you go.

1529
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:18,002
Okay. I'll see you later.

1530
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,580
Three years, no Larry Daley.

1531
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:05,260
He was the one that took the fall
for me, got me my job back.

1532
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:09,260
I heard he went back to school,
got his degree, became a teacher.

1533
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,420
I'm very glad.

1534
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,540
Well, when he heard about
this traveling exhibition...

1535
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,923
Larry insisted that I deliver this
to you personally.

1536
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:23,020
The infamous,
supposedly magic, glowing tablet.

1537
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,460
Larry Daley and his fanciful tales.

1538
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,524
Larry said you could be trusted.

1539
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,605
What do you mean?

1540
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,765
With the top secret knowledge.

1541
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,921
What are you doing?

1542
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,020
- I'm winking.
- You're blinking.

1543
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,020
No, I wink with both eyes.

1544
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,180
That's blinking.

1545
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,380
It doesn't matter, because right now...

1546
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,980
you better get ready!

1547
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,486
For what?

1548
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,601
For this.

1549
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,361
It does glow.

1550
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,527
Come on.

1551
01:29:58,240 --> 01:29:59,460
Sorry.

1552
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,140
Go ahead.

1553
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,885
Have fun-fun, Dum Dum.

1554
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,100
Stay!

1555
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,890
I'm not going anywhere.

1556
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,340
Stay!

1557
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,085
I'm not going anywhere!

1558
01:30:50,305 --> 01:31:50,214
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
