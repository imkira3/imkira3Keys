1
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:37,007
Dominic Toretto.

2
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:41,887
You are hereby sentenced to serve
25 years to life

3
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,578
at the Lompoc Maximum Security Prison system

4
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:48,977
without the possibility of early parole.

5
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:04,601
Here's what we know so far.

6
00:02:04,636 --> 00:02:08,223
This is all the aftermath of a daring,
daylight breakout.

7
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,357
There were 26 high-risk inmates
being transferred...

8
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:13,061
A daring midday breakout where everyone
onboard has been accounted for,

9
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:14,820
except for one, Dominic Toretto.

10
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:15,904
Police have just released the identity

11
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,483
of the man they believe to have orchestrated
the shocking escape

12
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:21,236
that amazingly resulted in no
fatalities this afternoon.

13
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:24,162
He is former federal agent, Brian O'Conner.

14
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:27,179
A fierce manhunt is underway
for three fugitives tonight.

15
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:30,162
Multiple federal and local agencies
have joined forces

16
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:31,795
in the search for Dominic Toretto

17
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,874
and his accomplices Brian O'Conner
and Mia Toretto.

18
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:38,270
But despite every eye in the country
looking for them

19
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:41,631
where Toretto and O'Conner
are now is anyone's guess.

20
00:03:58,209 --> 00:03:59,751
It's got to be it, right?

21
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:25,910
Let's get out of here.
Whoa, whoa.

22
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:27,529
Easy, friends.

23
00:04:27,564 --> 00:04:28,697
She's with me.

24
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,284
Mia.

25
00:04:33,244 --> 00:04:34,870
Vince.

26
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:40,542
Buster.

27
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,045
Come on.

28
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:46,965
Dom here yet?

29
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,265
No.

30
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,016
When was the last time you heard from him?

31
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:53,221
A couple of weeks ago.
Up in Ecuador somewhere.

32
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,809
How does it feel? What's that?

33
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:01,730
To be on the other side of a wanted poster?

34
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:04,983
He will show up.

35
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:06,276
Yeah.

36
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:13,492
Dom's?

37
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:16,286
Yeah.

38
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,874
Time for bed little one.

39
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:22,501
Can I bring him?

40
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:24,544
Of course.

41
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:25,629
Aw.

42
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:28,924
Good night.

43
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:48,610
Excuse me, sorry.

44
00:05:54,617 --> 00:05:56,368
Why Rio, Vince?

45
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:02,791
You mean after
you screwed everything up in LA?

46
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:08,046
Ended up free-falling through
South America, you know,

47
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:11,442
hitting every hellhole on the way down.

48
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:14,803
Would have kept on going if not for Rosa.

49
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:33,488
Does he know?

50
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,127
So, listen.

51
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:50,387
There is a job coming up.

52
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:52,389
I was hoping Dom was going to be here by now

53
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:56,011
but this one is clean enough
we can do it without him.

54
00:06:56,804 --> 00:07:01,308
It's a good gig.
Couple of high-end cars, easy targets.

55
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:05,353
Guy I know is putting together
a team to swipe them.

56
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:07,731
Just need a few more willing bodies.

57
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,573
I don't know.

58
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:12,506
Look, the way the car scene is down here

59
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,405
we can unload them quick and get top dollar.

60
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,497
It's easy money.

61
00:07:17,532 --> 00:07:19,868
And from where I am sitting,

62
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,122
it looks like you both could use the payday.

63
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:04,829
What are you reading?

64
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:06,790
Travel guide.

65
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,416
Yeah?

66
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:13,797
Tokyo.

67
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:16,633
Moscow.

68
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:21,144
Goa.

69
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:22,931
You want to know what all of these
places have in common?

70
00:08:23,265 --> 00:08:24,265
Huh?

71
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:26,601
No extradition.

72
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:43,076
Here we go.

73
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:01,344
Excuse me, buddy.

74
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:17,235
Okay.

75
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:42,177
Hey, we have found them.

76
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:44,012
Yeah, second-to-the-last freighter.

77
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:55,989
What is it?

78
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:59,736
DEA tags. These cars have been seized.

79
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:42,695
Look who showed up.

80
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:46,282
God, I am so happy you're okay.

81
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:50,752
I thought I told you to lay low.

82
00:10:50,787 --> 00:10:53,414
Been running on fumes. Had to make a call.

83
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:56,793
Hey. Quit talking.
We only got the two-minute window.

84
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:59,254
Let's go, Vince.

85
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,841
I am taking the GT40.

86
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:40,962
Ladies first.

87
00:11:47,136 --> 00:11:48,136
Hey.

88
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:50,722
Hey.

89
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:52,932
This car suits me better.

90
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:02,275
See you, baby.

91
00:12:08,657 --> 00:12:10,408
It's okay...
we're all going to the same place.

92
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:12,243
We will get the car there.

93
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,585
Change of plans. Wait for my call.

94
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:25,089
Let's go.

95
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:43,566
Where is she going?

96
00:12:45,235 --> 00:12:47,028
Where is she going? Hey.

97
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,614
Hey.

98
00:12:54,244 --> 00:12:57,664
We're being robbed. Whatever
happens, don't stop the train.

99
00:12:58,874 --> 00:12:59,958
Go after the girl.

100
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:01,668
Hurry up.

101
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:34,283
Access card. Get the access card.

102
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:48,149
Shit.

103
00:15:13,008 --> 00:15:15,134
Bridge. There is a bridge.

104
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,818
Luggage car is clear.

105
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:39,867
Freeze.

106
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:41,262
Oh, shit.

107
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:13,794
You had to make a call, huh?

108
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:16,589
Shitty call, O'Conner.

109
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,716
Shitty call.

110
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:41,364
You two stirred up quite a
bit of trouble today.

111
00:17:42,574 --> 00:17:44,540
Three of my men dead.

112
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:47,036
Three DEA agents along with them.

113
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:49,935
Of course, this is business

114
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,250
and sometimes things go astray.

115
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:55,676
All I care about is the car.

116
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,047
Tell me where it is,
and I will let you go.

117
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:03,928
This roofing plastic says you're
full of shit.

118
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:08,474
I don't know how you guys do business
in your part of the world,

119
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:09,600
but here in Rio,

120
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:13,312
I like it when all parties
know what they're up against.

121
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:14,820
That's funny.

122
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:17,483
Because it goes both ways.

123
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,319
You know,

124
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:25,992
I hear your sister is very beautiful.

125
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:29,870
Wherever she hides

126
00:18:31,248 --> 00:18:32,540
I will find her.

127
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:23,341
The American fugitives killed three DEA
agents during a train robbery...

128
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:26,309
...police warn they are armed
and extremely dangerous.

129
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:29,847
Anyone with information should contact
law enforcement immediately...

130
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:42,193
Mia?

131
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:44,111
Hey.

132
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:48,164
You okay?

133
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:50,201
Yeah, you all right?

134
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:53,788
Hey.

135
00:19:59,503 --> 00:20:01,420
Hey, yeah.

136
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:03,964
Just like a Toretto.

137
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:07,009
Where's Vince?

138
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:08,928
That's a good question.

139
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:11,937
He will be here.

140
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:13,147
Guys, we're all over the news.

141
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:16,644
They're blaming us for the killing
of those DEA agents on the train.

142
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,737
Which means we just jumped
to the top of the wanted list.

143
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:22,400
The feds have got to show everyone
their agents are off limits

144
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:25,277
and they're going to send their best
guys. We got to get out of here.

145
00:20:25,612 --> 00:20:28,614
One thing we know for sure

146
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:31,700
is that they wanted this car.

147
00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:34,585
Because something is in it.

148
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,374
If we find out what it is, we will
know what we're up against.

149
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:58,582
All right, listen up. The men
we're after are professional runners.

150
00:20:58,617 --> 00:21:01,439
They like speed and are guaranteed to
go down the hardest possible way

151
00:21:01,474 --> 00:21:02,863
so make sure you got your funderwear on.

152
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:06,673
We find them, we take them as a
team, and we bring them back.

153
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,912
And above all else, we don't ever,
ever let them get into cars.

154
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:13,117
Crime scene is 10 hours old and
counting, men. Let's go hunting.

155
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,373
Agente Hobbs.
Chief of Police, Joao Alemeida.

156
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:20,624
Luke.

157
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:23,884
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

158
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,046
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

159
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:27,638
Let me tell you something about these two men.

160
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:30,259
One is a former federal officer, been
in deep cover for five years.

161
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:32,143
He knows every way
you're going to come for him.

162
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:35,347
The other one is a professional
criminal, escaped prison twice,

163
00:21:35,382 --> 00:21:38,138
spent half his life on the
run avoiding folks like you.

164
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,895
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the DSS...

165
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,987
Two things. One, I need a translator.

166
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:44,607
We have plenty in the
public relations department.

167
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:46,484
Elena Neves.

168
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:49,445
A patrol officer? You heard me.

169
00:21:50,238 --> 00:21:52,406
But why? We have many more experienced people.

170
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:54,457
I like her smile.

171
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:56,494
What's the second thing?

172
00:21:57,746 --> 00:22:00,456
Stay the fuck out of my way.

173
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,343
Brian. Hm?

174
00:22:13,803 --> 00:22:15,221
I have something I have to tell you.

175
00:22:15,256 --> 00:22:16,972
God damn.

176
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:18,849
What a mess.

177
00:22:20,644 --> 00:22:22,311
Where you been, man?

178
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:26,906
You better check that tone.

179
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:28,859
And you just better answer the goddamn question.

180
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:30,444
Stop it. Both of you.

181
00:22:33,865 --> 00:22:34,907
Where were you, Vince?

182
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:39,084
Guys all over the favelas asking about you.

183
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:41,830
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.

184
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:43,328
Had to wait them out.

185
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,757
That is such horseshit.

186
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:46,961
That was your job,
and those were your guys. Hey.

187
00:22:46,996 --> 00:22:48,594
Hey. Enough, O'Conner.

188
00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:50,506
If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it.

189
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:51,674
Go walk it off.

190
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:10,359
Look, I would love to expand
my operations into your countries

191
00:23:10,694 --> 00:23:14,446
but, quite frankly, your business
methods are too violent.

192
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:17,783
Let me tell you a true story.

193
00:23:17,993 --> 00:23:22,288
Five hundred years ago, the Portuguese
and the Spanish came here,

194
00:23:22,323 --> 00:23:25,833
each trying to get the country
from their natives.

195
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:32,548
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.

196
00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:38,178
The natives killed every single Spaniard.

197
00:23:40,056 --> 00:23:44,018
Personally,
I prefer the methods of the Portuguese.

198
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:47,667
They came bearing gifts.

199
00:23:47,702 --> 00:23:49,648
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

200
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:54,159
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,

201
00:23:54,194 --> 00:23:57,531
but to continue receiving them, they
had to work for the Portuguese.

202
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,077
And that's why all Brazilians
speak Portuguese today.

203
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:06,624
Now, if you dominate the people with violence,

204
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:10,961
they will eventually fight back because
they have nothing to lose.

205
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:13,637
And that's the key.

206
00:24:13,672 --> 00:24:17,551
I go into the favelas and give them
something to lose.

207
00:24:18,553 --> 00:24:20,575
Electricity, running water,

208
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,598
school rooms for their kids.

209
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:27,061
And for that taste of a better life,

210
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,564
I own them.

211
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:32,775
Gentlemen.

212
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:38,614
I apologize for the interruption.

213
00:24:39,157 --> 00:24:41,700
Senor Reyes, may I speak with you?

214
00:24:41,735 --> 00:24:44,286
We have found them.

215
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:47,956
Pardon me, gentlemen.

216
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:05,099
Almost wish I didn't see that.

217
00:25:08,436 --> 00:25:10,458
Almost.

218
00:25:10,493 --> 00:25:12,481
Wait, Dom.

219
00:25:13,108 --> 00:25:14,733
Mia was on that train.

220
00:25:14,768 --> 00:25:16,443
My sister.

221
00:25:17,153 --> 00:25:19,697
I didn't know.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

222
00:25:19,732 --> 00:25:22,116
You set up the deal.

223
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:24,827
I thought the job was for the cars.

224
00:25:25,286 --> 00:25:27,002
I didn't know.

225
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:28,580
All they want is the chip.

226
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,292
Damn.

227
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:34,608
You should have come clean.

228
00:25:34,643 --> 00:25:36,255
What's going on out here?

229
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:38,305
Nothing.

230
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,885
Please, Dom, just let me have the
chip. I can take this to them.

231
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:44,138
They will give it to
Reyes and set things right.

232
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,223
Get out.

233
00:25:49,477 --> 00:25:50,853
What?

234
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:52,229
Get out.

235
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:02,371
You never listen to me.

236
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:06,160
Not when I told you he was a cop,
and not now.

237
00:26:07,162 --> 00:26:10,956
You never trust me and
look where it's gotten us.

238
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,333
Look at our family now.

239
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:18,464
I can't go home.
Your sister is stuck in this life.

240
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,507
Where's Letty, Dom?

241
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:24,011
Where's Letty?

242
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:49,918
Plasma cutter.

243
00:26:49,953 --> 00:26:53,290
Wilkes, I want a list of every
place within 50 miles

244
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:55,125
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

245
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,336
Pass me that manifest.

246
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:06,011
Officer Neves. Been waiting for you.

247
00:27:06,304 --> 00:27:08,472
You asked for me? I did.

248
00:27:08,723 --> 00:27:10,224
May I ask why?

249
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:12,726
My smile is not that great.

250
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:18,857
Your husband was an officer who
was gunned down in the favela.

251
00:27:18,892 --> 00:27:20,818
Six months later,
you upped and joined the force.

252
00:27:20,853 --> 00:27:22,152
You're motivated.

253
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:25,989
Plus, I figure you're the only one
in Rio who can't be bought.

254
00:27:26,024 --> 00:27:27,491
Am I right?

255
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:30,473
Yes. Of course I am.

256
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:32,127
Good news, bad news.

257
00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:33,879
You know I like my dessert first.

258
00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:35,923
Back-checked the rail line like you asked.

259
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:38,043
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.

260
00:27:38,378 --> 00:27:39,802
One set of tracks headed west

261
00:27:39,837 --> 00:27:42,589
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.

262
00:27:42,624 --> 00:27:43,931
But another set of tracks headed east.

263
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:46,426
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

264
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:49,096
The GT40 that was missing from the manifest.

265
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:50,764
Followed the trail a couple of miles.

266
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,057
Pretty easy in this scrub.

267
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,892
Can't move without leaving a sign.

268
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:55,400
Give me the damn veggies.

269
00:27:55,435 --> 00:27:58,814
The ground rolls into a hardpack
and we lost that track, too.

270
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:01,650
Not necessarily.

271
00:28:02,151 --> 00:28:04,862
That road heads up through the
hills into the favelas.

272
00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:07,573
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.

273
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:09,998
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

274
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:13,287
If they headed that way, we will
pick up their tracks there.

275
00:28:13,322 --> 00:28:15,243
You come prepared.

276
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,165
I am motivated.

277
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:18,917
All right, then.

278
00:28:19,627 --> 00:28:21,712
Let's find ourselves a car.

279
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:53,333
What do you think?

280
00:28:53,368 --> 00:28:55,871
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

281
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:59,583
Look at all these side menus
here for data entry.

282
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:01,501
Let's check this one.

283
00:29:06,215 --> 00:29:07,598
Look at that.

284
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:10,135
Same building, same order every week.

285
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,054
It's a delivery schedule.

286
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:34,201
What's this?

287
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,585
Drugs?

288
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,588
No. That's a dealer pack.

289
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,625
See, most major players,
they weigh their money

290
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,585
so they don't have to constantly count it.

291
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,968
Right there, that's 49 kilos.

292
00:29:45,003 --> 00:29:47,047
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

293
00:29:47,715 --> 00:29:50,217
You're saying each one of these shipments
is worth 10 million dollars?

294
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:51,343
Yeah.

295
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:16,243
I thought so.

296
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:20,253
So what is that?

297
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:22,624
A 100-million plus in cash houses?

298
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:24,960
That's how he keeps it off the grid.

299
00:30:27,588 --> 00:30:30,257
I think it's safe to say that Reyes
is smart to want this back.

300
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:32,926
It's his whole network right there,
just laid out on a chip.

301
00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:57,784
Wilkes, Fusco, up the middle.

302
00:30:57,819 --> 00:30:59,536
Mac, Chato, flank north.

303
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:00,971
What about me?

304
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:02,372
Stay here.

305
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:13,640
Go that way.

306
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:15,135
The other two went over the wall.

307
00:31:58,513 --> 00:31:59,596
Come on, go. Go.

308
00:32:57,864 --> 00:32:59,531
Get on the ground.

309
00:33:00,366 --> 00:33:02,617
I got Toretto. Four blocks north of your...

310
00:33:08,124 --> 00:33:09,916
They already know who you are.

311
00:33:41,908 --> 00:33:43,325
Let's go.

312
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:30,170
You okay here?

313
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:33,959
Yeah. I am good. Thank you.

314
00:35:08,703 --> 00:35:11,496
They're going to be looking for
the three of us together now.

315
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:14,256
We need to split up.

316
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:17,210
You and Mia head south,
I will lead them away.

317
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:18,295
No.

318
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,637
Dom is right.

319
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:22,465
Look how lucky we just got.
What happens next time?

320
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,591
We have no choice but to split up.

321
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:24,926
I am pregnant.

322
00:35:29,765 --> 00:35:31,266
I already lost my family once.

323
00:35:33,352 --> 00:35:35,895
I am not going through that again.

324
00:35:36,355 --> 00:35:38,565
Are you kidding me? No.

325
00:35:43,821 --> 00:35:46,448
I am not going anywhere. Okay?

326
00:35:48,826 --> 00:35:49,909
Dom?

327
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:52,954
Promise me we stick together.

328
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:02,589
I promise.

329
00:36:07,178 --> 00:36:09,637
Our family just got bigger.

330
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,491
Something doesn't add up.

331
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,451
Toretto and O'Conner.

332
00:36:31,952 --> 00:36:36,539
They stay when they're supposed to run,
they steal gas then give it away?

333
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:38,249
Now they're killing federal agents?

334
00:36:39,585 --> 00:36:41,253
It doesn't make any sense.

335
00:36:41,288 --> 00:36:42,921
Here's what makes sense.

336
00:36:47,593 --> 00:36:49,177
All these guys are is names on a list.

337
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:50,643
They come up, we take them down.

338
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:53,264
Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

339
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:55,058
Wilkes, we get anything?

340
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:56,775
Standard forensics.

341
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,353
Shoe prints. Hair and fiber.

342
00:36:58,388 --> 00:36:59,896
Prints are all over the car.

343
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:01,029
Anything else?

344
00:37:01,064 --> 00:37:03,024
Yeah,
we tracked the owner off the vehicle ID.

345
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:05,294
There are a couple of shell
companies in between,

346
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:07,805
but we finally traced it back
to a corporation

347
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,281
owned by an investor
down here named Hernan Reyes.

348
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:11,366
Investor?

349
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,829
If there's anything illegal happening
in Rio, Reyes is involved.

350
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:17,504
Okay, then so are we.

351
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,833
If he could get us any closer to our
guys, I want everything on him.

352
00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:21,216
Chato, you're on the roof.

353
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:23,628
I want you on overwatch in case somebody
comes back for something.

354
00:37:23,663 --> 00:37:26,054
Mac, give me a cross-check on Reyes,
full specs.

355
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:28,383
If he goes to the john, I want to know
how many times he shakes it.

356
00:37:28,418 --> 00:37:30,844
You got it, boss. Wilkes, Fusco.

357
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:33,430
Let's put all this mess back together.

358
00:37:35,808 --> 00:37:37,309
That's going to take a while.

359
00:37:37,344 --> 00:37:38,810
Then you better get started.

360
00:37:39,228 --> 00:37:40,777
They were taking this car apart for a reason.

361
00:37:40,812 --> 00:37:42,689
Let's put it back together
and find out what's missing.

362
00:38:10,384 --> 00:38:13,720
Hey, Dom,
what do you remember about your father?

363
00:38:16,182 --> 00:38:17,891
My father.

364
00:38:22,062 --> 00:38:24,314
He used to...

365
00:38:24,982 --> 00:38:28,359
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.

366
00:38:29,028 --> 00:38:31,404
For anybody in the neighborhood.

367
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:34,699
If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.

368
00:38:36,535 --> 00:38:40,295
Every single day he was in the
shop, and every single night,

369
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:45,418
he was at the kitchen table with Mia,
helping her with her homework.

370
00:38:46,837 --> 00:38:49,714
Even after she went to sleep,

371
00:38:49,749 --> 00:38:52,557
he'd stay up for a few more hours

372
00:38:52,592 --> 00:38:56,638
so he could learn the next chapter
and help her the next day.

373
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,599
I remember everything about my father.

374
00:39:01,185 --> 00:39:02,477
Everything.

375
00:39:03,604 --> 00:39:04,938
That's just it.

376
00:39:05,314 --> 00:39:06,814
I don't remember shit about my dad.

377
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:12,029
I don't remember him yelling.

378
00:39:12,064 --> 00:39:13,530
I don't remember him smiling.

379
00:39:15,574 --> 00:39:18,117
To be honest with you, I don't even
remember what the hell he looked like.

380
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:22,413
I don't remember. He just...

381
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,625
He was just never there.

382
00:39:27,836 --> 00:39:29,963
You ain't going to be like that, Brian.

383
00:39:46,605 --> 00:39:48,731
We can't keep running, Dom.

384
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:52,214
We got to get out.

385
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:54,028
We got to get out now.

386
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,573
You're right.

387
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:09,836
Here's how we're going to do it.

388
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:15,258
We're going to use this.

389
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:18,261
We're going do one last job.

390
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:21,055
We're going to take all of Reyes' money.

391
00:40:21,348 --> 00:40:22,932
Every dime of it,

392
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:25,518
and disappear.

393
00:40:29,148 --> 00:40:30,148
Forever.

394
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:32,824
New passports.

395
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:35,361
New lives with no more
looking over our shoulder.

396
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:37,113
And we're just going to buy our freedom.

397
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:38,204
That's right.

398
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,907
You realize we're talking
about going up against

399
00:40:39,942 --> 00:40:41,326
the most powerful guy in all of Rio?

400
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,077
Yes, we are.

401
00:40:44,496 --> 00:40:46,414
Then we're going to need a team.

402
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:55,381
Let's run through the bases real quick.
Who do we got?

403
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:56,841
First we're going to need a chameleon.

404
00:40:58,344 --> 00:41:02,221
Someone who can blend in anywhere.

405
00:41:03,265 --> 00:41:04,328
What else?

406
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:05,391
A fast talker.

407
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,811
Someone who can bullshit their
way out of anything.

408
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:10,229
I got that.

409
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:13,615
This guy is going to have
a lot of surveillance.

410
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,443
We're going to need someone
who's good with circuits.

411
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:20,115
And with those circuits,
Reyes is going to have walls.

412
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,617
We're going to need guys to
punch through those walls.

413
00:41:24,578 --> 00:41:25,620
What else?

414
00:41:26,163 --> 00:41:27,879
Utilities and weapons.

415
00:41:27,914 --> 00:41:30,750
Someone who ain't afraid to throw down.

416
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:33,670
Someone to back up every position.

417
00:41:33,705 --> 00:41:35,296
Yeah, what else do we need?

418
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:37,006
Most importantly,

419
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:40,301
we're going to need two precision drivers.

420
00:41:40,336 --> 00:41:43,012
Guys that don't crack under pressure.

421
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:44,555
Guys that never lose.

422
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:47,141
You know we got that.

423
00:42:15,045 --> 00:42:17,046
Aw, hell, no.

424
00:42:18,006 --> 00:42:20,717
I see they really scraped the bottom
of the barrel, huh?

425
00:42:20,752 --> 00:42:23,094
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

426
00:42:24,847 --> 00:42:27,890
When are you going to give Martin
Luther King his car back?

427
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:30,727
As soon as you give Rick
James his jacket back.

428
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:36,107
What's up, man? What's up?

429
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:48,369
Hmm.

430
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:50,851
Sexy legs, baby girl.

431
00:42:50,886 --> 00:42:52,582
What time do they open?

432
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:57,253
They open the same time
as I pull this trigger.

433
00:42:57,796 --> 00:42:59,255
Want me to open them?

434
00:43:02,634 --> 00:43:05,476
I told you the skinny chick had balls.

435
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:08,139
Looks like she started the party without us.

436
00:43:08,724 --> 00:43:11,350
Hey, anybody can talk shit in Spanish, homie.

437
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:14,270
What's this guy saying?

438
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,898
Ugly is still ugly in Spanish or in English.

439
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:22,278
Who are these clowns, man? Circus clowns.

440
00:43:24,406 --> 00:43:27,408
I thought cockfights were illegal in Brazil.

441
00:43:27,443 --> 00:43:29,577
I see you all have met.

442
00:43:31,288 --> 00:43:33,337
You know when you called me to come to Rio

443
00:43:33,372 --> 00:43:36,292
I assumed it would be for something
more exciting than this.

444
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:37,341
Look at this guy.

445
00:43:37,376 --> 00:43:39,587
Long time. I missed you, man.

446
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:41,189
Good to see you.

447
00:43:41,224 --> 00:43:42,722
Brother. What's up?

448
00:43:42,757 --> 00:43:44,842
Yo, check this out. This is Tej.

449
00:43:44,877 --> 00:43:46,695
Best circuit man on the East Coast.

450
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,513
And this is my boy, Roman Pearce.

451
00:43:48,847 --> 00:43:50,828
We go way back, I met this guy in juvie.

452
00:43:50,863 --> 00:43:52,809
I pulled that job with him in Miami.

453
00:43:52,844 --> 00:43:54,310
I have heard about you.

454
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:56,944
Nice digs.

455
00:43:56,979 --> 00:43:58,856
Yeah, well, the Ritz was sold out.

456
00:43:59,399 --> 00:44:01,115
So what's this all about, Dom?

457
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,570
Yeah, man, why did you drag
us halfmay around the world?

458
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:06,447
Because we got a job.

459
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:10,076
All right,
so our target's name is Hernan Reyes.

460
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,834
And he runs the drug scene down here.

461
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:14,497
He's never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.

462
00:44:14,532 --> 00:44:16,662
No paper trail means no banks.

463
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:18,758
And no banks means cash houses.

464
00:44:18,793 --> 00:44:21,295
That's right. Ten of them, to be exact.

465
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:23,513
Spread throughout the city.

466
00:44:23,548 --> 00:44:25,466
And we're going to hit them all.

467
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:27,927
All of them?

468
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:29,393
All of them.

469
00:44:29,428 --> 00:44:31,395
That sounds crazy.

470
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,515
You bring us to a whole other country

471
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,601
so we can rob the dude who runs it?

472
00:44:36,728 --> 00:44:38,354
I thought this was business.

473
00:44:38,647 --> 00:44:39,939
Sounds personal to me.

474
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:42,448
Is that what this is?

475
00:44:42,483 --> 00:44:46,362
I got love for you all,
but personal ain't good business.

476
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:50,241
I can't do this, homie.

477
00:44:51,493 --> 00:44:55,621
So what we're talking about is $100 million.

478
00:44:55,656 --> 00:44:57,713
You say what?

479
00:44:57,748 --> 00:45:01,425
Hundred...
See, sometimes I be over thinking, man,

480
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,589
and I know we just met, but
you just, kind of, got to...

481
00:45:04,624 --> 00:45:08,426
That's right, $100 million,
and everything we take,

482
00:45:08,461 --> 00:45:09,892
we split even.

483
00:45:09,927 --> 00:45:11,804
That's a little over $11 million apiece.

484
00:45:12,806 --> 00:45:14,181
I am down.

485
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:15,683
I am in.

486
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:18,728
Eleven million.

487
00:45:19,146 --> 00:45:21,856
Sounds like a whole lot of
vaginal activity to me.

488
00:45:22,316 --> 00:45:24,609
You can't pull off 10 heists
on the same mark.

489
00:45:24,644 --> 00:45:25,741
You just can't.

490
00:45:25,776 --> 00:45:27,368
As soon as we hit the first one,

491
00:45:27,403 --> 00:45:30,239
they're going to do everything
they can to protect the rest.

492
00:45:31,241 --> 00:45:32,992
Exactly.

493
00:46:11,573 --> 00:46:12,698
Nobody move.

494
00:46:27,881 --> 00:46:29,132
That's all of it.

495
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:30,348
You a dead man.

496
00:46:30,383 --> 00:46:31,550
You're all dead men.

497
00:46:32,386 --> 00:46:33,886
You don't have a place to hide.

498
00:46:36,848 --> 00:46:38,057
Who's hiding?

499
00:46:38,092 --> 00:46:40,524
Are you crazy?

500
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,521
Do you know whose house this is?
Whose money are you stealing?

501
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:55,408
We ain't stealing it.

502
00:47:04,334 --> 00:47:07,420
You tell your boss exactly who did this.

503
00:47:09,047 --> 00:47:10,548
Tell him there's more coming.

504
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:17,221
Voila.

505
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:19,181
Turn it over.

506
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:28,566
She's running on all eight.
Checks out fine.

507
00:47:31,111 --> 00:47:33,029
Keep looking.

508
00:47:35,073 --> 00:47:38,617
Boss, if something was missing, we'd know.

509
00:48:04,227 --> 00:48:07,897
It's a goddamn shame putting
bullshit like that on a classic.

510
00:48:08,273 --> 00:48:10,316
You may as well slap neon lights on it.

511
00:48:21,578 --> 00:48:23,544
They took the chip.

512
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:27,416
We got a hit on the police scanner.
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.

513
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:28,883
Address cross-checks against property

514
00:48:28,918 --> 00:48:30,669
owned by one of Hernan Reyes' corporations.

515
00:48:30,704 --> 00:48:31,886
All right, if that's our guys

516
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:34,590
then whatever was on that chip
led them directly to that house.

517
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:35,942
It's them, for sure.

518
00:48:35,977 --> 00:48:37,224
How do you know that?

519
00:48:37,259 --> 00:48:41,639
Because no one else in Rio is
stupid enough to rob Reyes.

520
00:48:55,362 --> 00:48:56,410
Explain.

521
00:48:56,445 --> 00:48:58,197
They invaded the Leblon house.

522
00:48:58,573 --> 00:48:59,872
Who invaded?

523
00:48:59,907 --> 00:49:02,368
The men from the train.

524
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,795
How much did they take?

525
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:14,880
They didn't take anything.

526
00:49:14,915 --> 00:49:18,592
They burned it.

527
00:49:18,885 --> 00:49:20,434
They burned my money?

528
00:49:20,469 --> 00:49:23,681
Yes. And said there's more coming.

529
00:49:31,731 --> 00:49:32,773
Okay...

530
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:43,409
Then this...

531
00:49:45,287 --> 00:49:46,745
...is what we're going to do.

532
00:49:53,295 --> 00:49:54,920
Clean the houses.

533
00:49:55,213 --> 00:49:59,425
I want that money under lock and key...

534
00:50:00,886 --> 00:50:01,969
...within an hour.

535
00:50:02,004 --> 00:50:04,263
Understand?

536
00:50:06,474 --> 00:50:08,100
Understood.

537
00:50:27,078 --> 00:50:29,496
Number one is on the move, man.

538
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:45,429
Two is on the move.

539
00:51:10,163 --> 00:51:11,163
I got mine.

540
00:51:32,185 --> 00:51:34,186
I got eyes on Five.

541
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,216
I know you all said they were consolidating
the money somewhere, but,

542
00:52:04,551 --> 00:52:07,428
you all ain't going to believe this.

543
00:52:17,147 --> 00:52:19,606
Well, this job just got a lot harder.

544
00:52:20,275 --> 00:52:22,464
If he's moving it into a police station

545
00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:24,653
he's got some serious brass in his pocket.

546
00:52:25,822 --> 00:52:27,323
Looks like this is going to be a
shorter trip than I thought...

547
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:29,780
Hell, yeah, we can't do this.

548
00:52:29,815 --> 00:52:32,202
"Can't"? You mean, "shouldn't. "

549
00:52:33,163 --> 00:52:35,247
I think this doesn't change a thing.

550
00:52:38,335 --> 00:52:40,669
I say we stick to the plan.

551
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:42,386
You say what?

552
00:52:42,421 --> 00:52:44,173
This just went from Mission: Impossible

553
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,133
to Mission: In-freaking-sanity.

554
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:49,560
Whatever, man.

555
00:52:49,595 --> 00:52:53,057
I ain't scared, I am just letting you
all know, going in that building is crazy.

556
00:52:53,092 --> 00:52:54,558
I got this.

557
00:52:58,188 --> 00:52:59,521
What time was the robbery?

558
00:52:59,556 --> 00:53:01,440
Around 11:00.

559
00:53:02,984 --> 00:53:04,193
Here we go.

560
00:53:06,363 --> 00:53:07,863
Enhance it.

561
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:11,408
Their faces are covered.

562
00:53:11,443 --> 00:53:12,618
Run it through FRS.

563
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:20,334
Well, hello, you son of a bitch.

564
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:26,256
Wilkes. Run the photos of known associates
of Toretto and O'Conner

565
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:29,183
against customs entries into
Brazil in the last two weeks.

566
00:53:29,218 --> 00:53:32,471
Check planes, trains, boats, everything
short of the goddamn space shuttle.

567
00:53:38,812 --> 00:53:41,897
They can change their names but
they can't change their faces.

568
00:53:41,932 --> 00:53:43,732
Something big is going down.

569
00:53:45,485 --> 00:53:46,867
That's a 1970 Charger.

570
00:53:46,902 --> 00:53:49,036
Fusco. Upload these specs into the database.

571
00:53:49,071 --> 00:53:51,448
Have the computer cross-check
it with overhead satellites

572
00:53:51,483 --> 00:53:53,499
every 15 minutes, the van behind it, too.

573
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:56,370
If these vehicles move in the streets
of Rio, I want to know about it.

574
00:54:05,255 --> 00:54:06,318
Everything okay?

575
00:54:06,353 --> 00:54:07,346
Everything is okay.

576
00:54:07,381 --> 00:54:10,134
Who is this Hobbs? This Federal
Agent running around town?

577
00:54:10,385 --> 00:54:11,385
Some American cowboy.

578
00:54:12,137 --> 00:54:13,137
He's handled.

579
00:54:13,388 --> 00:54:14,847
He killed sixteen of our men.

580
00:54:15,557 --> 00:54:16,730
Handle him better.

581
00:54:16,765 --> 00:54:22,229
Look... He requested a rookie
patrol officer as his assistant.

582
00:54:24,983 --> 00:54:25,983
They won't be a problem.

583
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:56,889
It's all here? Yes.

584
00:54:58,391 --> 00:55:00,142
What about Toretto and O'Conner?
Where are they?

585
00:55:00,602 --> 00:55:01,602
Nothing yet.

586
00:55:02,645 --> 00:55:04,480
But I have all our officers searching.

587
00:55:05,315 --> 00:55:06,440
Not good enough.

588
00:55:07,317 --> 00:55:08,734
Put a price on their heads.

589
00:55:08,769 --> 00:55:10,319
High enough...

590
00:55:10,904 --> 00:55:13,030
...to get every pair of eyes in
the city searching for them.

591
00:55:20,497 --> 00:55:22,998
The beauty of public offices?

592
00:55:25,919 --> 00:55:26,919
Public records.

593
00:55:27,337 --> 00:55:29,755
This is where he's keeping the money.
The vault in the evidence room.

594
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:35,177
Um. Uh, yeah. Can I get everyone's
attention, right here, for a second?

595
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:38,931
We're talking about breaking
into a police station.

596
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:40,724
Is anyone listening to those words?

597
00:55:40,759 --> 00:55:42,316
Anybody? Popo?

598
00:55:42,351 --> 00:55:44,373
Five-O. One-time. Pigs.

599
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:46,361
People we don't like.

600
00:55:46,396 --> 00:55:49,399
You know, police stations are designed
to keep people in, not out.

601
00:55:49,434 --> 00:55:50,776
That's why it's a stealth mission.

602
00:55:51,194 --> 00:55:53,904
We will be in and out before they
even know we were there.

603
00:55:53,939 --> 00:55:55,496
Well, we will need to get eyes in there.

604
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:58,075
At least to find out the make
and model of that vault.

605
00:55:58,326 --> 00:56:01,662
So the vault and then, so...

606
00:56:01,697 --> 00:56:03,170
It's crazy.

607
00:56:03,205 --> 00:56:06,124
Who's supposed to do all this?

608
00:56:14,551 --> 00:56:16,468
What do you mean?

609
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:18,685
Why me?

610
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,722
Because you got the biggest mouth.

611
00:56:20,757 --> 00:56:22,808
That's for damn sure.

612
00:56:29,524 --> 00:56:30,524
Ooh.

613
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:33,867
Hello, beautiful.

614
00:56:33,902 --> 00:56:36,578
Look at those dimples. Sexy, sexy.

615
00:56:36,613 --> 00:56:38,740
Love those glasses.
Where did you get them from?

616
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:41,243
Are those like Gucci frames or something?

617
00:56:41,278 --> 00:56:42,459
No English?

618
00:56:42,494 --> 00:56:45,372
No, no, no. Damn.

619
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:46,999
How are you, sir?

620
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:51,253
Special Agent O'Conner. US Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

621
00:56:51,288 --> 00:56:52,546
It says Caucasian.

622
00:56:52,839 --> 00:56:55,591
That's a tan. You know, a tan?

623
00:56:58,511 --> 00:57:02,556
Look, I am working this case and I got
some evidence here to be held.

624
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:05,017
But I need to get in and check
your storage facility first.

625
00:57:05,052 --> 00:57:06,066
Nope.

626
00:57:06,101 --> 00:57:09,479
Look, I know you're a true professional,
and I respect you, I promise.

627
00:57:09,514 --> 00:57:11,732
You know, it looks like you
work out a little bit, too.

628
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:14,276
What do you bench, about 350?

629
00:57:14,694 --> 00:57:15,694
Ah, shit.

630
00:57:16,863 --> 00:57:18,161
Look, I am just trying to do my job, man.

631
00:57:18,196 --> 00:57:21,158
My boss sent me here to just make
sure that everything was safe.

632
00:57:21,193 --> 00:57:22,207
It will be safe.

633
00:57:22,242 --> 00:57:24,411
Let me just come in and take a quick peek.

634
00:57:24,446 --> 00:57:25,460
Nope.

635
00:57:25,495 --> 00:57:28,123
Come on, man. Hook a brother up, please?

636
00:57:28,158 --> 00:57:29,663
Nope. And you're not my brother.

637
00:57:29,698 --> 00:57:31,133
Brother from another mother?

638
00:57:31,168 --> 00:57:34,463
Look. No one enters the facility but
authorized evidence personnel.

639
00:57:34,498 --> 00:57:35,721
Now stop wasting my time.

640
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:37,049
I am going to call the embassy.

641
00:57:37,084 --> 00:57:38,342
No, no, no. No, we're good.

642
00:57:38,676 --> 00:57:40,802
We don't need to call them.
For what? We're good.

643
00:57:40,837 --> 00:57:43,437
Here, I got the box. We're all good.

644
00:57:43,472 --> 00:57:46,440
I promise you.
Thank you so much for your time.

645
00:57:46,475 --> 00:57:48,769
Swear to God, if you were on
the other side of that glass

646
00:57:48,804 --> 00:57:51,229
I'd bust your damn face in.
Now translate that.

647
00:58:09,082 --> 00:58:12,793
It's done. See, I think I make a better
special agent than you ever did.

648
00:58:14,545 --> 00:58:16,838
Well, that depends on how you define "special. "

649
00:58:19,884 --> 00:58:21,176
Come on, now. Let's see what we got.

650
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:22,761
Not funny.

651
00:58:30,103 --> 00:58:31,812
All right, come on.

652
00:58:36,859 --> 00:58:38,360
Dawg, you still can't drive.

653
00:58:39,987 --> 00:58:42,989
Now, I see why you're always
getting into accidents.

654
00:58:43,024 --> 00:58:45,154
You can't even drive a
damn remote control car.

655
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:47,285
I am going to need you to shut up right now.

656
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,138
I am not going to shut up. Shut up.

657
00:58:49,173 --> 00:58:50,956
Strap him in his safety belt, man.

658
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:55,676
Give me the remote, dawg. Go left.

659
00:58:55,711 --> 00:58:57,921
It looks like something right over
there to the left. What is that?

660
00:58:57,956 --> 00:58:59,005
What is that?

661
00:59:00,383 --> 00:59:01,383
Bingo.

662
00:59:02,635 --> 00:59:04,636
What is that, six-by-six?

663
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:06,030
Eight-by-twelve.

664
00:59:06,065 --> 00:59:07,354
Seven-by-twelve.

665
00:59:07,389 --> 00:59:10,565
Fitted with 18-inch-thick steel
reinforced walls...

666
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,229
...with a insulated copper core to
protect against thermal lance.

667
00:59:14,264 --> 00:59:17,774
A Class-3 electronic lock with
a surefire Griffin retumbler

668
00:59:17,809 --> 00:59:19,533
and a biometric palm scanner.

669
00:59:19,568 --> 00:59:21,736
Ten tons of top-of-the-line security.

670
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:23,881
Do I want to know how you know all that?

671
00:59:23,916 --> 00:59:25,912
I had a life before you knew me, O'Conner.

672
00:59:25,947 --> 00:59:27,909
Let's just leave it at that, all right?

673
00:59:27,944 --> 00:59:29,661
She is a beauty, though, man.

674
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:31,878
A "beauty" as in "good"?

675
00:59:31,913 --> 00:59:34,715
"Beauty" as in, she's going to
start off playing hard to get.

676
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:39,087
Then, no matter how much I caress her,
no matter how much I love her,

677
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:42,424
in the end, she still
ain't going to give up that ass.

678
00:59:49,015 --> 00:59:50,515
Two to one says you blow the wrong pipe.

679
00:59:50,892 --> 00:59:52,934
Yo, why you got to be so negative
all the time, man?

680
00:59:54,145 --> 00:59:55,444
I ain't negative.

681
00:59:55,479 --> 00:59:58,356
I am just positive you're going to mess it up.

682
00:59:58,733 --> 01:00:01,735
I am telling you, man, you got issues.

683
01:00:06,532 --> 01:00:10,202
Next time if there's no elevator,
I am not coming.

684
01:00:10,745 --> 01:00:13,747
You need to learn to relax, loco.

685
01:00:35,394 --> 01:00:37,437
You better hurry up,
we got less than a minute.

686
01:00:37,472 --> 01:00:43,485
Why do you always set the timer so short?

687
01:01:06,926 --> 01:01:08,176
I hope you know where you're going.

688
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:11,096
I got this. Relax, man.

689
01:01:11,131 --> 01:01:11,816
Relax.

690
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:26,945
...a police station.

691
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:28,738
Relax.

692
01:01:40,543 --> 01:01:42,377
You used too much explosive. Again.

693
01:01:43,462 --> 01:01:45,130
Too much, too little...

694
01:01:45,715 --> 01:01:46,715
It's all the same.

695
01:01:47,383 --> 01:01:52,220
That's some Buddha shit you learned from
a book in the prison library, isn't it?

696
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:54,931
And what you're doing there on the wall...

697
01:01:54,966 --> 01:01:57,809
You got that from the same book, huh?

698
01:01:58,311 --> 01:01:59,311
You're so negative, bro.

699
01:02:26,172 --> 01:02:28,506
Can I have some light?

700
01:02:31,928 --> 01:02:34,269
Got it. We got it.

701
01:02:34,304 --> 01:02:36,014
Yeah, we're looking at four cameras.

702
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:38,558
Yo, that's some high-end shit, too.

703
01:02:38,593 --> 01:02:39,684
Marker optics.

704
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:42,062
Hundred-degree field-of-view.

705
01:02:42,355 --> 01:02:43,820
Ten seconds oscillation.

706
01:02:43,855 --> 01:02:45,906
Yeah, that's a narrow window, man.

707
01:02:45,941 --> 01:02:47,692
Can't we just tap in and replace the image?

708
01:02:47,727 --> 01:02:49,795
No, it's hooked into a digital sync.

709
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:51,863
They would know we were in the system.

710
01:02:51,898 --> 01:02:53,955
The best we can do is peek.

711
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:56,660
We're going to need some real
fast cars to get through this.

712
01:02:56,695 --> 01:02:58,203
Not just fast.

713
01:02:58,496 --> 01:03:00,476
You got a hard right and a hairpin.

714
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:02,457
We're going to need something agile.

715
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:04,292
You guys mock up a track.

716
01:03:04,327 --> 01:03:05,377
O'Conner.

717
01:03:06,712 --> 01:03:08,129
Let's go get some cars.

718
01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:10,048
Nice.

719
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:51,256
Home sweet home.

720
01:04:09,191 --> 01:04:10,316
Or that.

721
01:04:11,193 --> 01:04:13,695
How about that?
All motor, no tuning issues.

722
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:16,079
I always wanted one of those.

723
01:04:16,114 --> 01:04:19,784
Held the record on the
Avenida three years running.

724
01:04:21,203 --> 01:04:22,252
Damn, bro...

725
01:04:22,287 --> 01:04:24,998
You got a lot of balls to bring
your problems here, Toretto.

726
01:04:25,374 --> 01:04:28,216
Not to mention a cop.

727
01:04:28,251 --> 01:04:30,510
Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

728
01:04:30,545 --> 01:04:33,590
Word on the street is a lot of people
are looking for you two.

729
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,550
What?

730
01:04:35,885 --> 01:04:37,594
You didn't think we'd recognize you?

731
01:04:38,971 --> 01:04:40,972
No, we're kind of counting on it.

732
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:43,725
That little coupe may
run the streets around here,

733
01:04:45,227 --> 01:04:49,272
but that monster has never
seen a set of tail lights.

734
01:04:49,982 --> 01:04:51,316
Ever. Well, she's about to.

735
01:04:53,402 --> 01:04:54,527
Dominic Toretto's ride in my garage.

736
01:04:55,613 --> 01:04:59,783
Now that... will be a nice trophy.

737
01:05:01,535 --> 01:05:04,120
Let's go, legend.

738
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,270
Car for car.

739
01:05:07,305 --> 01:05:09,501
Car for car?

740
01:05:09,877 --> 01:05:11,377
You want it, come and get it.

741
01:05:16,092 --> 01:05:17,926
Let's see what they got.

742
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,558
Really?

743
01:05:27,228 --> 01:05:30,334
Where did you get that from? Papa Smurf?

744
01:05:30,369 --> 01:05:33,441
Okay, O'Conner, give it your best shot.

745
01:05:56,507 --> 01:05:57,549
How was that one?

746
01:05:57,584 --> 01:05:58,591
Camera caught you.

747
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:01,101
What? Yeah, it still caught you.

748
01:06:01,136 --> 01:06:03,179
Man, I was milking the hell
out of that thing, too.

749
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:05,682
We're going to need a faster car.

750
01:06:10,271 --> 01:06:12,021
I want my money. Come on, man.

751
01:06:15,734 --> 01:06:16,734
Yeah.

752
01:06:19,363 --> 01:06:21,239
Let's get it. Watch this.

753
01:06:27,913 --> 01:06:31,457
That's exactly why your
ass ain't been driving.

754
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:44,679
I think I am in love.

755
01:06:48,475 --> 01:06:49,941
That was real solid work.

756
01:06:49,976 --> 01:06:53,521
I think Camera 3 still caught you, though.

757
01:06:53,556 --> 01:06:54,814
Let's do it again.

758
01:07:02,323 --> 01:07:04,282
That's the piggy bank you ordered.

759
01:07:04,317 --> 01:07:06,284
You're kidding me. Yep.

760
01:07:08,162 --> 01:07:10,955
Where in the hell
did you all get one of these?

761
01:07:11,665 --> 01:07:13,458
Well, we had a life before you met us.

762
01:07:14,793 --> 01:07:18,129
All right, I will get to work
on the electronic tumbler

763
01:07:18,164 --> 01:07:20,381
but there's still another problem.

764
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:22,348
Palm scanner.

765
01:07:22,383 --> 01:07:24,260
And without Reyes' handprint,

766
01:07:24,595 --> 01:07:26,700
Houdini himself couldn't open this bitch.

767
01:07:26,735 --> 01:07:28,806
How do you know it's Reyes' handprint?

768
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:30,607
You got $100 million in a safe.

769
01:07:30,642 --> 01:07:32,435
You going to put somebody
else's handprint on it?

770
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:35,521
Now there you
go with that negativity, man.

771
01:07:35,556 --> 01:07:36,940
That shit is eating you alive.

772
01:07:36,975 --> 01:07:38,239
You check that.

773
01:07:38,274 --> 01:07:40,366
Yo, check that. Shut up.

774
01:07:40,401 --> 01:07:42,570
How are we supposed to get Reyes' handprint?

775
01:07:43,864 --> 01:07:45,371
Han.

776
01:07:45,406 --> 01:07:46,491
You're up.

777
01:07:48,494 --> 01:07:51,329
Sure. Nothing like the easy stuff.

778
01:07:52,164 --> 01:07:53,915
Let's go. I will drive.

779
01:08:12,351 --> 01:08:14,352
I make six bodyguards. Seven.

780
01:08:15,187 --> 01:08:18,314
You think that guy with a
fanny pack is a tourist?

781
01:08:23,362 --> 01:08:25,787
So, how long were you in the army?

782
01:08:25,822 --> 01:08:28,700
That gun you pulled the other
day was a Jericho 941.

783
01:08:30,035 --> 01:08:31,870
Thumb-racking the slide?

784
01:08:31,905 --> 01:08:33,705
That was straight-up Mossad.

785
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:36,833
I got out of the military

786
01:08:38,043 --> 01:08:41,004
probably the same time you quit smoking.

787
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:43,047
The amount of chips you eat,

788
01:08:43,507 --> 01:08:46,592
the way you always have to keep
your hands and mouth busy,

789
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:49,262
you were a two-pack-a-day man for sure.

790
01:08:51,348 --> 01:08:52,974
Unfiltered.

791
01:08:56,645 --> 01:08:58,062
Well, this is a bust.

792
01:08:59,231 --> 01:09:02,484
We're not going to be able to
get his fingerprints out here.

793
01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:05,737
We need to do some more recon,
call in a couple of extra guys.

794
01:09:05,772 --> 01:09:06,237
Or

795
01:09:07,489 --> 01:09:09,699
you don't send a man to do a woman's job.

796
01:10:07,966 --> 01:10:10,718
We're going to figure this out,
I promise you.

797
01:10:14,014 --> 01:10:15,306
What's up?

798
01:10:15,933 --> 01:10:18,476
I thought you were more of a thong man.

799
01:10:18,511 --> 01:10:19,894
We got the print.

800
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,772
Where?

801
01:10:24,775 --> 01:10:26,734
Okay, that's crazy.

802
01:10:28,445 --> 01:10:32,949
So, did he just slap that ass or
did he grab and hold on to it?

803
01:10:35,494 --> 01:10:37,578
Hey, this will work.

804
01:10:38,205 --> 01:10:39,873
I am impressed.

805
01:10:39,908 --> 01:10:41,506
Got it?
Got it.

806
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:43,334
But you still didn't answer the question.

807
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:51,759
Oh, no. Guys, guys.
Guys, we have a problem.

808
01:10:51,794 --> 01:10:54,095
The whole team just got burnt.

809
01:10:55,514 --> 01:10:57,348
Now we're all wanted.

810
01:10:59,518 --> 01:11:00,483
How did this happen?

811
01:11:00,518 --> 01:11:04,272
US Diplomatic Security Service
issued the warrants.

812
01:11:04,307 --> 01:11:06,190
Agent L. Hobbs.

813
01:11:06,567 --> 01:11:07,567
Hold on one second.

814
01:11:08,694 --> 01:11:09,735
Hey, Dom.

815
01:11:11,405 --> 01:11:13,197
Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

816
01:11:16,034 --> 01:11:17,160
Yeah.

817
01:11:17,536 --> 01:11:20,997
Hobbs is the leader of the elite
task force for the DSS.

818
01:11:21,032 --> 01:11:22,171
So he's good.

819
01:11:22,206 --> 01:11:25,376
When the FBI wants to find somebody,
that's who they call.

820
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:27,211
Because he never misses his mark.

821
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:30,173
This guy is Old Testament.

822
01:11:30,549 --> 01:11:33,551
Blood, bullets, wrath of God.
That's his style.

823
01:11:33,927 --> 01:11:36,310
And right now he's hunting us?

824
01:11:36,345 --> 01:11:38,139
Dom, we got to move up our timeline.

825
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:39,313
Yeah, but how?

826
01:11:39,348 --> 01:11:42,894
This thing's already been difficult
without Wyatt Earp on our asses.

827
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:45,229
If anything, we need more room to breathe.

828
01:11:47,566 --> 01:11:48,941
Roman's right.

829
01:11:51,778 --> 01:11:54,238
Think we need to get some fresh air.

830
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,244
We have got a hit. '70s Charger.

831
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:02,330
Let's get a move on.

832
01:12:05,751 --> 01:12:08,336
Eastbound on Avenida Atlantica.

833
01:12:08,371 --> 01:12:09,837
Move, move, move, move.

834
01:12:16,094 --> 01:12:17,762
It stopped about a block ahead.

835
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:19,847
Park it. We're going on foot.

836
01:12:43,163 --> 01:12:44,288
Hey, Toretto.

837
01:12:52,381 --> 01:12:54,006
You're under arrest.

838
01:12:54,299 --> 01:12:55,466
Arrest?

839
01:12:56,635 --> 01:12:58,553
I don't feel like I am under arrest.

840
01:12:59,304 --> 01:13:00,555
How about you, Brian?

841
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:01,806
No, not a bit.

842
01:13:03,767 --> 01:13:04,982
Not even a little bit.

843
01:13:05,017 --> 01:13:07,353
Just give it a minute. It will sink in.

844
01:13:10,774 --> 01:13:13,234
We didn't kill those feds. That was Reyes.

845
01:13:13,269 --> 01:13:14,575
I don't give a shit.

846
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:17,488
I am just here to bring in two assholes
whose names hit my desk.

847
01:13:17,781 --> 01:13:20,992
Yeah, that sounds like a real hero.

848
01:13:24,037 --> 01:13:25,545
That's funny.

849
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:28,749
From a guy who took the oath of a cop,
then went against everything it stood for.

850
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,550
Or some wannabe tough guy prick

851
01:13:30,585 --> 01:13:33,045
who beat a man half to death with
a socket wrench.

852
01:13:33,797 --> 01:13:35,006
Yeah, real tough.

853
01:13:36,008 --> 01:13:39,176
You turn around and put your
hands behind your back.

854
01:13:40,345 --> 01:13:41,727
I don't think so.

855
01:13:41,762 --> 01:13:44,473
Your mistake is thinking you
got a goddamn choice, boy.

856
01:13:48,645 --> 01:13:50,229
And your mistake?

857
01:13:50,856 --> 01:13:52,356
Thinking you're in America.

858
01:13:55,527 --> 01:13:59,030
You're a long way from home.

859
01:14:01,533 --> 01:14:04,035
This is Brazil.

860
01:14:19,259 --> 01:14:21,510
Come on, boss. Another day.

861
01:14:23,221 --> 01:14:25,681
Come on, H, it's a lot of heat.

862
01:14:30,896 --> 01:14:33,230
I will see you soon, Toretto.

863
01:14:34,566 --> 01:14:37,151
I look forward to it, cop.

864
01:15:14,439 --> 01:15:15,404
Yep.

865
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:16,899
Tracker's on.

866
01:15:18,276 --> 01:15:19,276
Got them.

867
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:27,887
I don't understand. Why come here?

868
01:16:28,388 --> 01:16:31,223
Why risk it all for $20 worth of silver?

869
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:36,061
Because it's worth it.

870
01:16:39,858 --> 01:16:41,400
You should run, you know.

871
01:16:42,152 --> 01:16:43,569
Hobbs will find you.

872
01:16:46,281 --> 01:16:49,200
You have every reason to leave.
Why stay?

873
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:58,709
Why do you?

874
01:17:00,253 --> 01:17:02,254
My husband was a good police officer.

875
01:17:03,089 --> 01:17:04,715
An honest man.

876
01:17:06,134 --> 01:17:07,843
We both grew up here.

877
01:17:08,887 --> 01:17:11,138
Two years ago he was murdered
in the street...

878
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:12,973
...right outside our door.

879
01:17:15,477 --> 01:17:19,230
Reyes owns this favela now.
He gives things to people.

880
01:17:21,566 --> 01:17:23,859
But everything has a price.

881
01:17:26,571 --> 01:17:28,322
The people here need a new start.

882
01:17:28,907 --> 01:17:30,407
They need to be free.

883
01:17:40,293 --> 01:17:41,919
You didn't kill those men in the train,

884
01:17:42,587 --> 01:17:43,879
did you?

885
01:17:48,426 --> 01:17:51,220
Now, why would you believe anything
I would tell you?

886
01:17:58,103 --> 01:17:59,395
Hey.

887
01:18:02,774 --> 01:18:04,483
Was she so special to you?

888
01:18:09,281 --> 01:18:11,615
I never thought
anyone could understand how much.

889
01:18:15,078 --> 01:18:16,453
But you do.

890
01:18:39,644 --> 01:18:40,644
Yeah.

891
01:18:51,865 --> 01:18:53,157
Close, but not enough.

892
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,249
Dom, the window is too small, man.

893
01:18:55,284 --> 01:18:59,121
Only way we're going to beat the
cameras is with invisible cars.

894
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:04,209
And I know just where to get them.

895
01:19:07,339 --> 01:19:08,631
Let's take a ride, boys.

896
01:19:16,514 --> 01:19:18,557
Don't hurt yourself.

897
01:19:37,202 --> 01:19:39,578
It's been a while since I have been
behind the wheel of one of these.

898
01:19:39,871 --> 01:19:41,789
First time I have ever been in the front seat.

899
01:19:49,547 --> 01:19:51,090
Rome, what took you so long?

900
01:19:51,466 --> 01:19:55,302
I thought for sure you'd be showing up with
some chrome spinners or something.

901
01:19:56,388 --> 01:19:57,388
Real funny.

902
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:02,518
I got $100,000 that says I can take
you all in the next quarter-mile.

903
01:20:02,553 --> 01:20:04,144
Yeah, your broke ass has got a hundred grand.

904
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:06,563
If we pull off this job, I will.

905
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,399
The next two lights.

906
01:20:08,692 --> 01:20:09,858
Hundred thousand.

907
01:20:10,819 --> 01:20:13,612
We don't pull this job off,
we're probably dead anyway.

908
01:20:14,155 --> 01:20:16,198
Let's make it a million.

909
01:20:17,075 --> 01:20:19,410
I like that. All right,
a million-dollar quarter-mile.

910
01:20:20,662 --> 01:20:22,204
All right, then.

911
01:20:22,497 --> 01:20:25,040
You only live once. Let's do it.

912
01:20:25,542 --> 01:20:26,583
What do you say, Dom?

913
01:20:27,252 --> 01:20:28,711
We talking or we racing?

914
01:20:30,171 --> 01:20:31,255
Just don't cheat this time.

915
01:20:31,881 --> 01:20:34,508
Got to let that go.

916
01:20:53,111 --> 01:20:54,570
Yeah.

917
01:20:57,657 --> 01:20:58,706
Typical, Roman.

918
01:20:58,741 --> 01:21:01,285
I am going to get this money.
I am hungry.

919
01:21:09,586 --> 01:21:11,253
Don't make it too easy for me, boys.

920
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:15,090
No.

921
01:21:16,301 --> 01:21:18,052
Not this time, Dom.

922
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:24,641
You got to want it, Brian.

923
01:21:52,837 --> 01:21:56,673
Yeah. Owned you. Owned you.

924
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:13,732
Good race, O'Conner. Thanks, Dom.

925
01:22:15,693 --> 01:22:18,487
Do you know how long
I have been waiting for that shit?

926
01:22:18,522 --> 01:22:20,531
I told you he didn't see it.

927
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:22,414
Your man right there?

928
01:22:22,449 --> 01:22:25,097
He let off the throttle at the line.

929
01:22:25,132 --> 01:22:27,746
You didn't do nothing. He let you win.

930
01:22:28,706 --> 01:22:30,415
Bullshit.

931
01:22:51,563 --> 01:22:54,356
Vince, what are you doing? Quiet.
They have been tracking you.

932
01:23:02,991 --> 01:23:04,074
I know she's here.

933
01:23:06,578 --> 01:23:08,016
Find her.

934
01:23:08,051 --> 01:23:09,454
Go. Go. Go.

935
01:23:23,845 --> 01:23:25,477
It's okay. Wait.

936
01:23:25,512 --> 01:23:28,640
Reyes' guys were waiting for me at the market.

937
01:23:29,601 --> 01:23:31,226
Vince saved my life.

938
01:23:36,649 --> 01:23:38,108
You hungry?

939
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:43,697
Yeah, sure. Good.

940
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:46,658
Because you're saying grace.

941
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:51,288
Thanks, Vince.

942
01:23:58,421 --> 01:23:59,469
Yo, you burned it.

943
01:23:59,504 --> 01:24:02,514
Yo, this is how my momma does it.
Relax.

944
01:24:02,549 --> 01:24:04,968
Yeah, but your mom is
the worst cook in the world.

945
01:24:05,003 --> 01:24:07,930
Yo, don't you be talking about my momma.

946
01:24:10,099 --> 01:24:12,455
Yeah, come on, baby. Who's good living?

947
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:14,818
To you, bro. Cheers, cheers, cheers.

948
01:24:14,853 --> 01:24:17,147
So, we in Brazil. It's the good life.

949
01:24:17,182 --> 01:24:18,197
Yeah.

950
01:24:18,232 --> 01:24:22,110
So, you got a little more than
$10 or $11 million coming.

951
01:24:22,145 --> 01:24:23,320
What you going to do with your money?

952
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:25,037
Me? Yeah.

953
01:24:25,072 --> 01:24:27,908
Actually, man, I been thinking about
opening up a garage back home.

954
01:24:28,868 --> 01:24:31,662
Place where people can bring their cars
and not get completely ripped off.

955
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:32,871
You know what I mean?

956
01:24:32,906 --> 01:24:34,254
Really? Yeah.

957
01:24:34,289 --> 01:24:36,896
So, your dream is to start a day job?

958
01:24:36,931 --> 01:24:39,468
That's stupid. Like, why would...

959
01:24:39,503 --> 01:24:42,172
No, it's not stupid at all.
I love what I do.

960
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:43,222
That don't make no sense to me.

961
01:24:43,257 --> 01:24:46,176
I know what I am going to do with my money.

962
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:50,097
Buying some cooking lessons for my man.

963
01:24:50,598 --> 01:24:52,022
See? See?

964
01:24:52,057 --> 01:24:54,309
There you go with that negativity, man.

965
01:24:54,344 --> 01:24:56,526
You know me. Money ain't a goddamn thing.

966
01:24:56,561 --> 01:24:59,189
It's going to take a little more than
money to learn how to cook.

967
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:00,524
That's horrible.

968
01:25:01,067 --> 01:25:04,736
But I heard they was looking for a
chef down at this animal shelter.

969
01:25:04,771 --> 01:25:06,234
You might want to...

970
01:25:06,269 --> 01:25:07,698
I know the manager.

971
01:25:13,121 --> 01:25:14,788
Hey, Dom.

972
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,001
Listen.

973
01:25:19,752 --> 01:25:23,463
I know that you're all
set for this job tomorrow,

974
01:25:23,498 --> 01:25:25,299
but if you need an extra man, I could...

975
01:25:25,334 --> 01:25:26,717
You're in.

976
01:25:35,143 --> 01:25:36,685
There's always room for family.

977
01:25:43,151 --> 01:25:44,192
Thank you.

978
01:25:48,781 --> 01:25:49,906
Get something to eat.

979
01:25:51,701 --> 01:25:53,327
Yeah.

980
01:25:55,204 --> 01:25:56,913
Can you believe Mia calls this a curse?

981
01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:02,878
She might be right.

982
01:26:07,216 --> 01:26:09,676
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

983
01:26:09,927 --> 01:26:14,181
When your life is on the line that's
when you learn about yourself.

984
01:26:19,145 --> 01:26:20,896
That's a fair deal.

985
01:26:24,192 --> 01:26:28,320
We're less than 24 hours from the
biggest celebration of our life.

986
01:26:28,355 --> 01:26:30,697
You all need a refill.
This is serious stuff.

987
01:26:30,732 --> 01:26:32,258
No, I am good. Cheers, baby.

988
01:26:32,293 --> 01:26:33,784
I am good. No, thank you.

989
01:26:33,819 --> 01:26:34,868
No, she can't.

990
01:26:37,121 --> 01:26:39,122
What do you mean? She can't.

991
01:26:39,457 --> 01:26:42,125
What do you mean she can't?
What is...

992
01:26:46,297 --> 01:26:48,513
Are you serious right now?

993
01:26:48,548 --> 01:26:52,344
Is that the reason you let him
beat you in the quarter-mile?

994
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:56,932
That was a baby gift.
No, that's messed up.

995
01:26:56,967 --> 01:26:58,600
No, you're not taking that from me.

996
01:26:58,635 --> 01:27:00,275
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

997
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:04,689
So, did he just smack the ass or
did he grab and hold on to it?

998
01:27:05,066 --> 01:27:06,031
Which one was it?

999
01:27:06,066 --> 01:27:08,318
Congratulations. Thank you.

1000
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:10,504
How can you keep this a secret?

1001
01:27:10,539 --> 01:27:12,621
Crazy, huh?
It's your boy.

1002
01:27:12,656 --> 01:27:16,326
Why would you keep something
like that away from me?

1003
01:27:16,661 --> 01:27:18,453
Baby gift, huh?

1004
01:27:18,704 --> 01:27:21,540
I have no idea what they're talking about.
Oh?

1005
01:27:21,575 --> 01:27:24,626
What happened to the pull-out method, man?

1006
01:27:25,711 --> 01:27:27,754
Toast. Toast.

1007
01:27:36,097 --> 01:27:39,349
Money will come and go. We know that.

1008
01:27:40,476 --> 01:27:43,854
But the most important thing in life will
always be the people in this room.

1009
01:27:45,273 --> 01:27:46,523
Right here.

1010
01:27:49,152 --> 01:27:50,193
Right now.

1011
01:28:04,792 --> 01:28:06,376
I am all set.

1012
01:28:07,378 --> 01:28:10,380
Yo, Santos. Van good?

1013
01:28:11,466 --> 01:28:13,675
You know we're always good, bro.

1014
01:28:17,555 --> 01:28:20,265
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.

1015
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,976
We're not going to get a better window.

1016
01:28:23,011 --> 01:28:25,277
Okay, guys, it's show time.

1017
01:28:25,312 --> 01:28:26,980
First team in position, let's go.

1018
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:28,315
Come on, let's do this.

1019
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:41,620
Hey, Dom.

1020
01:28:43,456 --> 01:28:44,581
I got eyes on Mia.

1021
01:28:49,587 --> 01:28:52,672
Moscow, Bali, Goa, Hong Kong.

1022
01:28:53,299 --> 01:28:55,175
And what do they all have in common?

1023
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:56,343
No extradition.

1024
01:28:58,429 --> 01:29:01,181
We're one hour away from the rest of our lives.

1025
01:29:01,216 --> 01:29:02,557
Yeah.

1026
01:29:04,268 --> 01:29:05,268
Cops.

1027
01:29:07,855 --> 01:29:09,231
Come on. Go.

1028
01:29:20,826 --> 01:29:22,452
You just made a big mistake.

1029
01:29:23,955 --> 01:29:25,872
Took me a while to find that tracking chip.

1030
01:29:26,374 --> 01:29:27,749
But not as long to flip the receiver.

1031
01:29:27,784 --> 01:29:29,334
You're going down, Toretto.

1032
01:29:29,669 --> 01:29:31,461
I am right here.

1033
01:30:59,592 --> 01:31:01,593
Dom. Stand back. I got this.

1034
01:31:07,516 --> 01:31:11,436
Pull off. Dom. Please, stop.

1035
01:31:17,068 --> 01:31:18,068
Dom.

1036
01:31:27,244 --> 01:31:28,578
Dom.

1037
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:32,142
Yeah.

1038
01:32:33,519 --> 01:32:35,478
We're coming in now.

1039
01:32:37,064 --> 01:32:39,733
Have the marshals meet us at
the airport when we land.

1040
01:32:47,616 --> 01:32:48,992
Ambush.

1041
01:33:06,635 --> 01:33:09,846
Wilkes, suppression fire. Shut them down.

1042
01:33:14,059 --> 01:33:15,727
Stagger-step. Cover me.

1043
01:33:20,733 --> 01:33:21,775
Watch them.

1044
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:34,419
Cut us loose.

1045
01:33:34,454 --> 01:33:36,539
Come on. Cut us loose.

1046
01:35:34,992 --> 01:35:36,367
We're good? Yeah, let's go, let's go.

1047
01:36:09,652 --> 01:36:11,277
Hey, Dom.

1048
01:36:17,534 --> 01:36:19,702
You have got to meet my son.

1049
01:36:19,995 --> 01:36:21,746
Nico.

1050
01:36:26,502 --> 01:36:27,961
I will.

1051
01:36:30,881 --> 01:36:32,131
He's a good kid.

1052
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:38,596
You know, we named him after you.

1053
01:36:40,391 --> 01:36:41,724
"Dominic. "

1054
01:36:48,983 --> 01:36:50,984
You have got my word, Vince.

1055
01:36:57,533 --> 01:36:59,617
You were always my brother.

1056
01:37:09,253 --> 01:37:11,754
I got eyes on Nico now.

1057
01:37:22,433 --> 01:37:24,851
We need to move.
We don't have that much time.

1058
01:37:24,886 --> 01:37:26,025
I got us a flight out.

1059
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:28,730
We can leave Rio in the
rearview in the next five hours.

1060
01:37:28,765 --> 01:37:30,606
Not to run away.

1061
01:37:32,026 --> 01:37:33,609
To finish the job.

1062
01:37:34,445 --> 01:37:36,863
Are you crazy, Dom? We can't.

1063
01:37:37,448 --> 01:37:39,032
It's a suicide mission.

1064
01:37:40,117 --> 01:37:41,784
That's your man over there on the table.

1065
01:37:43,162 --> 01:37:45,204
The plan is busted.

1066
01:37:45,497 --> 01:37:47,999
This is bullshit, man.
Reyes knows we're coming.

1067
01:37:48,034 --> 01:37:49,459
He's right.

1068
01:37:49,752 --> 01:37:52,545
They tripled the detail at the police station.

1069
01:37:52,963 --> 01:37:55,214
It's going to be a wall of gunfire.

1070
01:37:57,426 --> 01:37:59,510
Reyes doesn't get away with this.

1071
01:37:59,803 --> 01:38:01,054
It's a trap, man.

1072
01:38:01,089 --> 01:38:02,305
You know that.

1073
01:38:02,973 --> 01:38:05,308
Dom, listen to them.

1074
01:38:05,976 --> 01:38:08,561
Run, before it's too late. Leave Rio.

1075
01:38:09,938 --> 01:38:11,272
You can be free.

1076
01:38:13,442 --> 01:38:15,443
Running ain't freedom.

1077
01:38:16,904 --> 01:38:18,321
You should know that.

1078
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:25,828
You know you're all free to
make your own choices.

1079
01:38:30,042 --> 01:38:31,167
I am in.

1080
01:38:40,552 --> 01:38:42,178
I will ride with you, Toretto.

1081
01:38:45,474 --> 01:38:48,017
At least until we kill that son of a bitch.

1082
01:38:56,443 --> 01:38:58,027
So what's the plan, Dom?

1083
01:38:58,862 --> 01:39:00,905
We can't just go sneaking around anymore.

1084
01:39:02,407 --> 01:39:04,367
We don't sneak.

1085
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:08,287
The only thing he cares about is his money.

1086
01:39:08,539 --> 01:39:09,872
We pull that,

1087
01:39:10,874 --> 01:39:12,291
we pull him.

1088
01:39:29,685 --> 01:39:30,726
See?

1089
01:39:31,895 --> 01:39:34,564
I called in every cop on our payroll.

1090
01:39:36,066 --> 01:39:37,859
We're covered.

1091
01:39:39,570 --> 01:39:41,696
We have got every entrance covered
with weapons teams.

1092
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:43,823
God Himself couldn't get at your
money if He wanted to.

1093
01:39:44,324 --> 01:39:48,661
God isn't my worry.

1094
01:39:58,422 --> 01:39:59,422
You ready?

1095
01:40:01,717 --> 01:40:02,717
I am ready.

1096
01:41:01,068 --> 01:41:02,158
What's happening?

1097
01:41:02,193 --> 01:41:03,736
They're taking the vault.

1098
01:41:03,771 --> 01:41:05,488
What? The vault.

1099
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:18,292
Follow me. Quickly.

1100
01:41:22,631 --> 01:41:24,131
Let me through.

1101
01:41:34,184 --> 01:41:35,184
Don't move.

1102
01:41:36,395 --> 01:41:37,770
Stay down.

1103
01:42:07,759 --> 01:42:09,100
Call it out, Mia.

1104
01:42:09,135 --> 01:42:10,720
You have got a straight shot for two blocks.

1105
01:42:12,222 --> 01:42:13,723
Go right. Got it.

1106
01:42:36,121 --> 01:42:37,670
Well, the plan is working.

1107
01:42:37,705 --> 01:42:42,668
You guys have every corrupt cop in Rio
on your tail. You have to move fast.

1108
01:42:42,703 --> 01:42:43,801
What's the best route?

1109
01:42:43,836 --> 01:42:47,173
Okay, keep going straight another
half-mile onto Rua Fonseca,

1110
01:42:47,208 --> 01:42:49,175
and then go left.

1111
01:42:52,929 --> 01:42:53,971
That ain't going to work.

1112
01:42:56,058 --> 01:42:57,641
Spikes ahead, Dom. We got spikes.

1113
01:42:58,060 --> 01:42:59,643
We're going right.

1114
01:43:01,021 --> 01:43:02,313
No, it's too tight, we're not going to fit.

1115
01:43:02,348 --> 01:43:03,856
We have got no choice. Now.

1116
01:43:23,543 --> 01:43:24,710
Shit.

1117
01:43:31,343 --> 01:43:32,600
Holy shit.

1118
01:43:32,635 --> 01:43:35,596
Guys, I am hearing all this chatter.
Did you just take out a bank?

1119
01:43:44,648 --> 01:43:45,648
Two inbound.

1120
01:43:48,068 --> 01:43:49,527
All right, there's an alley
coming up on your left.

1121
01:43:49,562 --> 01:43:51,278
Yeah, I got it.

1122
01:44:44,666 --> 01:44:46,292
You little bastard.

1123
01:45:09,441 --> 01:45:12,151
All right, good job, Dom. Right-hander,
right here, right-hander.

1124
01:45:18,533 --> 01:45:20,576
Guys, there's a big group coming
at you from the south.

1125
01:45:20,611 --> 01:45:22,453
You have to do something now.

1126
01:45:25,332 --> 01:45:26,373
Hey, go wide.

1127
01:45:59,157 --> 01:46:00,157
Yeah.

1128
01:47:14,024 --> 01:47:15,316
You're all clear on the left.

1129
01:47:15,351 --> 01:47:17,234
Good afternoon, officer.

1130
01:47:19,237 --> 01:47:21,655
License and registration, please.

1131
01:47:27,871 --> 01:47:30,060
Yes. This is big-boy stuff.

1132
01:47:30,095 --> 01:47:32,249
We're clear on the right.

1133
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:33,584
Oh, man.

1134
01:47:40,383 --> 01:47:41,425
Thanks, guys.

1135
01:47:41,801 --> 01:47:42,926
Any time.

1136
01:47:43,219 --> 01:47:44,768
I will see you on the other side.

1137
01:47:44,803 --> 01:47:47,181
You guys just carved out a 10-second window.

1138
01:47:47,216 --> 01:47:48,724
Make it count.

1139
01:47:56,066 --> 01:47:57,232
Zizi, stay on them.

1140
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,678
They can't outrun us on the bridge.

1141
01:48:27,639 --> 01:48:28,639
Shit.

1142
01:48:35,730 --> 01:48:36,939
They have no way out.

1143
01:48:38,942 --> 01:48:39,942
No.

1144
01:48:40,777 --> 01:48:41,825
There's too many of them.

1145
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:43,904
Hey, there's too many of them.
We're not going to make it.

1146
01:48:47,617 --> 01:48:48,617
You're right, we aren't.

1147
01:48:49,911 --> 01:48:50,834
You are.

1148
01:48:50,869 --> 01:48:52,246
What are you talking about?

1149
01:48:52,455 --> 01:48:54,873
Just let the vault go.
Get out of there.

1150
01:48:54,908 --> 01:48:56,632
You're a father now, Brian.

1151
01:48:56,667 --> 01:48:58,919
No, I am not leaving you.
Now you stick with the plan.

1152
01:48:59,629 --> 01:49:01,004
It was always the plan.

1153
01:49:01,756 --> 01:49:03,013
Take care of Mia.

1154
01:49:03,048 --> 01:49:05,551
Dom, you listen to me now. Okay?

1155
01:49:05,586 --> 01:49:07,469
You cut loose right now.

1156
01:49:24,821 --> 01:49:25,863
Hey, what is he doing?

1157
01:49:29,826 --> 01:49:30,951
We have got him.

1158
01:49:47,802 --> 01:49:49,052
Close down the bridge.

1159
01:50:23,296 --> 01:50:24,671
Do something, asshole.

1160
01:50:36,768 --> 01:50:37,893
Kill him, damn it.

1161
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:50,739
Kill him now.

1162
01:52:02,437 --> 01:52:05,147
I thought I told you to go on.

1163
01:52:07,108 --> 01:52:09,318
Yeah, I had to make a call.

1164
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:28,337
Help me.

1165
01:52:30,715 --> 01:52:32,716
That's for my team, you son of a bitch.

1166
01:52:36,888 --> 01:52:38,597
It's a hell of a mess.

1167
01:52:39,307 --> 01:52:40,933
Yeah, it is.

1168
01:52:42,435 --> 01:52:44,186
You know I can't let you two go.

1169
01:52:44,687 --> 01:52:46,271
I ain't made that way.

1170
01:52:49,025 --> 01:52:51,693
The way I see it,
you have earned yourselves 24 hours.

1171
01:52:52,862 --> 01:52:53,862
The money stays, though.

1172
01:52:55,198 --> 01:52:57,366
If I were you, I'd use the time.

1173
01:52:57,700 --> 01:53:00,702
Make peace with whatever demons you got left.

1174
01:53:05,166 --> 01:53:07,042
Because come tomorrow,

1175
01:53:08,419 --> 01:53:09,544
I will find you.

1176
01:53:21,391 --> 01:53:22,683
Toretto.

1177
01:53:23,601 --> 01:53:24,893
I will see you soon.

1178
01:53:27,730 --> 01:53:29,606
No, you won't.

1179
01:54:11,065 --> 01:54:12,114
Thanks, guys.

1180
01:54:12,149 --> 01:54:13,734
I will see you on the other side.

1181
01:54:18,614 --> 01:54:21,074
You guys just carved out a 10 second window.

1182
01:54:21,109 --> 01:54:22,451
Make it count.

1183
01:55:04,869 --> 01:55:06,703
Come on, baby.

1184
01:55:06,738 --> 01:55:08,538
Don't be mean.

1185
01:55:10,792 --> 01:55:11,792
Come on.

1186
01:56:23,406 --> 01:56:26,867
"For Rosa and Nico. See you soon, Uncle Dom"

1187
01:56:39,922 --> 01:56:41,006
You sure about this?

1188
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,259
You know I am.

1189
01:56:46,220 --> 01:56:47,679
You don't need to do this.

1190
01:56:48,681 --> 01:56:50,981
Just leave me alone.

1191
01:56:51,016 --> 01:56:53,143
Bro, I am not trying to be negative,
but casinos...

1192
01:56:53,352 --> 01:56:56,062
...are the kinds of places designed to
take money from guys like you and me.

1193
01:56:56,097 --> 01:56:59,900
When I win here I am buying you a lifetime
supply of antidepressants.

1194
01:57:00,193 --> 01:57:03,195
You don't put ten million on red.

1195
01:57:03,230 --> 01:57:04,202
Enough already.

1196
01:57:04,237 --> 01:57:05,697
You put it on black.

1197
01:57:08,284 --> 01:57:09,409
No more bets.

1198
01:57:35,436 --> 01:57:37,646
Right this way, my dear.

1199
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:41,524
You stay right here,
I will be right back.

1200
01:57:43,361 --> 01:57:45,133
So, this is your dream, huh?

1201
01:57:45,168 --> 01:57:46,787
It's enough for me, man.

1202
01:57:46,822 --> 01:57:48,371
I take it that's your dream.

1203
01:57:48,406 --> 01:57:51,076
Absolutely. What up, boy?
What's going on?

1204
01:57:51,111 --> 01:57:52,678
You good? Yes, yes.

1205
01:57:52,713 --> 01:57:54,211
You know what's crazy?

1206
01:57:54,246 --> 01:57:56,915
There's only four of those cars
in the whole world.

1207
01:57:57,458 --> 01:57:59,876
Yeah, I got the only one in the
Western Hemisphere.

1208
01:58:00,378 --> 01:58:04,673
I made a sheikh in Abu Dhabi
an offer he could not refuse.

1209
01:58:05,007 --> 01:58:07,259
Huh.
That's a nice lady you got there, too.

1210
01:58:07,294 --> 01:58:10,762
Absolutely. What's happening?

1211
01:58:11,555 --> 01:58:13,765
We got to go, man. Let's do this.

1212
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:15,482
Okay, I will drive.

1213
01:58:15,517 --> 01:58:18,144
In that? Come on, man, no way.

1214
01:58:18,179 --> 01:58:20,522
No, no. Not in this.

1215
01:58:20,557 --> 01:58:21,773
In that.

1216
01:58:28,114 --> 01:58:29,656
Are you serious right now?

1217
01:58:30,449 --> 01:58:31,748
Man, this is crazy.

1218
01:58:31,783 --> 01:58:36,454
Yes, I guess that means there are two
in the Western Hemisphere, huh?

1219
01:58:37,331 --> 01:58:39,666
What's your smart ass got to say now?

1220
01:58:40,209 --> 01:58:43,628
You know what?
We can always shine together, baby.

1221
01:58:43,663 --> 01:58:46,089
Get dressed, man, we got things to do.

1222
01:58:58,519 --> 01:59:00,061
So, where to now?

1223
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:01,569
I don't know.

1224
01:59:01,604 --> 01:59:04,030
Never been to Madrid.

1225
01:59:04,065 --> 01:59:06,901
I thought you wanted to go to Tokyo.

1226
01:59:06,936 --> 01:59:09,154
We will get there.

1227
01:59:09,189 --> 01:59:10,864
Eventually.

1228
02:00:10,216 --> 02:00:12,050
Nice surprise.

1229
02:00:15,638 --> 02:00:17,305
Crazy, right?

1230
02:00:25,523 --> 02:00:28,566
This is the happiest
I have ever seen my sister.

1231
02:00:29,610 --> 02:00:31,611
It's because we're free.

1232
02:00:44,959 --> 02:00:47,210
You know, I want another shot.

1233
02:00:50,756 --> 02:00:51,756
Yeah?

1234
02:00:53,843 --> 02:00:55,475
Yeah.

1235
02:00:55,510 --> 02:00:57,394
No wagers, nobody else.

1236
02:00:57,429 --> 02:00:59,681
Just you and me, once and for all.

1237
02:01:06,772 --> 02:01:08,731
You sure you can handle the disappointment?

1238
02:01:09,608 --> 02:01:11,025
Are you?

1239
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:15,321
All right, O'Conner.

1240
02:01:15,356 --> 02:01:17,323
Let's see what you got.

1241
02:03:45,180 --> 02:03:47,015
You need to look at that.

1242
02:03:50,936 --> 02:03:52,895
Berlin, 3:00 a. m. this morning.

1243
02:03:53,147 --> 02:03:55,940
A team of drivers hijacked a military convoy.

1244
02:03:55,975 --> 02:03:57,859
Toretto? Nope.

1245
02:03:58,861 --> 02:03:59,784
I ain't interested.

1246
02:03:59,819 --> 02:04:02,739
Yes, you are. Keep looking.

1247
02:04:14,251 --> 02:04:16,085
Do you believe in ghosts?
