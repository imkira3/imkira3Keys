Hey, come on. We're superheroes.
What could happen?

157
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,824
ANNOUNCER: In a stunning turn of
events, a superhero is being sued

158
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,327
for saving someone who,
apparently, didn't want to be saved.

159
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,079
The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,

160
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,624
who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by Mr. Incredible,

161
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,711
has filed suit against the famed
superhero in Superior Court.

162
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,132
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

163
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,218
The injury received from
Mr. Incredible's "actions,"

164
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,637
- causes him daily pain.
- I saved your life!

165
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,973
You didn't save my life!
You ruined my death.

166
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,766
LAWYER: My client has no comment.

167
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:47,479
ANNOUNCER: Another suit was filed
by victims of the El train accident.

168
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,649
Incredible's court losses
cost the government millions.

169
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:55,112
And opened the floodgates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over.

170
00:10:55,196 --> 00:11:00,159
It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

171
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,245
Time for them to join us, or go away.

172
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,248
ANNOUNCER: Under public pressure,
and the financial burden

173
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,792
of an ever mounting series of lawsuits,

174
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,921
the government quietly initiated
the Superhero Relocation Program.

175
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,466
The supers were granted amnesty
from responsibility for past actions,

176
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:20,888
in exchange for the promise
to never again resume hero work.

177
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,681
Where are they now?

178
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:27,019
They are living among us.
Average citizens, average heroes.

179
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:32,441
Quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place.

180
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,403
Denied? You're denying my claim?

181
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,032
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

182
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,284
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

183
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,827
but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17.

184
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,748
- It states clearly...
- (STAMMERING) I can't pay for this.

185
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,625
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

186
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,294
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

187
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,671
We're now officially moved in.

188
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,548
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

189
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,967
The last three years
don't count because...

190
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:03,096
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha.

191
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,598
HELEN: Why do we have
so much junk?

192
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,183
Listen, I've got a client.

193
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,353
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

194
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,730
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

195
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,733
Bye, honey.
Excuse me. Where were we?

196
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:19,363
(SOBBING) I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

197
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,490
I don't know what I'll do.

198
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,450
(BLOWS NOSE LOUDLY)

199
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,244
(SOBBING)

200
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,584
All right, listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

201
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,296
I'd like to tell you to take a copy
of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

202
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,341
(WHISPERING) Norma Wilcox.
W-I-L-C-O-X.

203
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,677
On the third floor. But I can't.

204
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,806
I also do not advise you
to fill out and file a WS2475 form

205
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,849
with our legal department
on the second floor.

206
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,186
I wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

207
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,605
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

208
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,982
Oh, thank you, young man.

209
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,818
(SHOUTING) Sorry.
I know you're upset!

210
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,444
(WHISPERING) Pretend to be upset.

211

213
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,869
You authorized payment
on the Walker policy!

214
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,038
Someone broke
into their house, Mr. Huph.

215
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,208
- Their policy covers...
- I don't wanna know about it.

216
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,129
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping Insuricare in the black.

217
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,423
Tell me how that's possible,
with you writing checks

218
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:23,885
to every Harry Hardluck and Sally
Sobstory that gives you a phone call.

(OVER PA) Morning break is over.
Morning break is over.

220
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,647
I appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Parr.

221
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,068
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

222
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:44,323
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

223
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,783
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you!

224
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,911
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

225
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,789
Well... Not really. No.

226
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:53,999
Actually, not.

227
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,126
Oh, then how do you know it was him?

228
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,754
I hid a camera.
Yeah, and this time, I've got him.

229
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,637
See? You see?

230
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,348
You don't see it?

231
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,935
He moves! Right there!

232
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,439
Wait, wait! Right there!

233
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,149
Right as I'm sitting down!

234
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,942
I don't know how he does it,

235
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,278
but there's no tack before he moves

236
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,491
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

237
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,413
- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

238

(SCREAMING) This little rat is guilty!

239
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,128
You and your son can go now,
Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble.

240
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,173
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

241
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,885
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty!

242
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:55,394
Dash, this is the third time this year
you've been sent to the office.

243
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,981
We need to find a better outlet.
A more constructive outlet.

244
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,901
Maybe I could,
if you'd let me go out for sports.

245
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,112
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

246
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:09,741
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

247
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,701
Dashiell Robert Parr,

248
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,288
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

249
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,499
The last thing you need is temptation.

250
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,961
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

251
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,255
Why can't I do the best that I can do?

252
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,966
Right now, honey,
the world just wants us to fit in,

253
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,593
and to fit in, we just gotta be
like everybody else.

254
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,596
Dad always said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

255
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:35,267
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

256
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,978
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

Everything at the table
was grown right here.

611
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,816
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

612
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,901
- Jeez.
- HELEN: Hurry, honey.

613
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,320
Or you'll be late for work.

614
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,782
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

615
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,743
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

616
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,870
All that jazz.

617
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,580
(LAUGHING)

618
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:10,879
You have an appointment?

619
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,798
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

620
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:16,802
- All visitors are required...
- E: Go check the electric fence.

621
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,929
What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?

622
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:24,226
My God, you've gotten fat. Come in.
Come, come.

623
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:36,238
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

624
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:40,617
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

625
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,495
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prayge... Prague?

626
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,914
Milan, darling. Milan.

627
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,960
E: Supermodels.
Nothing super about them.

628
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,212
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

629
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,840
with poofy lips who think only
about themselves.

630
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:58,844
Feh! I used to design for gods.

631
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:05,016
But perhaps you come with a challenge,
eh? I was surprised to get your call.

632
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,435
E, I just need a patch job.

633
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,814
Hmm. This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

634
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:15,443
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, Robert?

635
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,113
Moonlighting hero work?

636
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,031
Must have happened a long time ago.

637
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:23,159
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

638
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,745
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

639
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:30,000
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

640
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,211
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

641
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,922
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

642
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,508
A new suit? Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

643
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,011
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

644
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,305
So ask me now,
before I again become sane.

645
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,266
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

646
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,686
You push too hard, darling!
But I accept.

647
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,856
- E: It will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

648
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,149
Heroic!

649
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,861
Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy!

650
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,615
Oh! He had a great look!
Oh, the cape and the boots...

651
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,741
E: No capes!

652
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,913
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

653
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,749
E: Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.

654
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:14,127
- Listen, E...
- November 15th of '58.

655
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,672
E: All was well, another day saved

656
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,550
when his cape snagged
on a missile fin.

657
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,969
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

658
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,054
Stratogale!

659
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:29,434
E: April 23rd, '57.
Cape caught in a jet turbine.

660
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,811
You can't generalize
about these things.

661
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:35,190
E: Meta-Man. Express elevator.
Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.

662
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:39,069
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes!

663
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,572
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

664
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,699
You know I'm retired from hero work.

665
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:48,036
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

666
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,499
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

667
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,670
(SIGHS) Fine.
I will also fix the hobo suit.

668
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,341
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

669
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:13,353
(PHONE RINGS)

670
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,648
BOB: Don't answer it, honey, I got it!

671
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,484
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

672
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,408
MIRAGE: How soon can you get here?
BOB: I'll leave tomorrow morning.

673
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,284
- MIRAGE: See you there.
- Goodbye.

674
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,790
Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?

675
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,793
Another conference.
Short notice, but, you know,

676
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,712
duty calls. (NERVOUS LAUGH)

677
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,555
- HELEN: Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

678
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,143
- Ha... Have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

679
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,812
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

680
00:46:55,896 --> 00:47:00,066
- So much.
- I love you, too.

681
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,165
SHIP'S COMPUTER:
This is your automated Captain.

682
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,418
Would you care for more mimosa?

683
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,671
- BOB: Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

684
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:27,969
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.

685
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,687
Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.

686
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,715
MIRAGE: Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Nice suit.

687
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,091
Thanks.

688
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,928
Nice to be back, Mirage.

689
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:39,457
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at 2:00.

690
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,961
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

691
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,546
See you there.

692
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,496
(GASPS) Edna.

693
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,457
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
- E: This is Edna.

694
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,252
- E? This is Helen.
- Helen who?

695
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,589
Helen Parr? You know...

696
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:29,799
Elastigirl?

697
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:34,137
Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!

698
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,972
(STAMMERING) It's been a while.

699
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,515
There's only one person
Bob would trust

700
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,309
to patch his supersuit. That's you.

701
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,352
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

702
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:44,606
Much better than those
horrible pajamas he used to wear.

703
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,191
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

704
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,360
- HELEN: I'm calling about...
- Don't make me beg.

705
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,945
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg?

706
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,656
No, I'm calling about suit.

707
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:56,492
(STAMMERING) Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

708
00:49:56,577 --> 00:50:00,371
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

709
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,886
Hmm.

710
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,808
(CREAKING)

711
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,112
SYNDROME: It's bigger!

712
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,491
It's badder!

713
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:43,081
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

714
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,876
It's finally ready.

715
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:51,339
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

716
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,884
but, man, it wasn't good enough!

717
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,972
After you trashed the last one, I had
to make some major modifications.

718
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:02,141
Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it.

719
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:06,396
I mean, after all, I am your biggest fan.

720
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:10,984
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

721
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,820
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

722
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,365
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

723
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,702
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

724
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,454
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

725
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:27,291
SYNDROME: It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

726
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,335
You can't count on anyone.

727
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,337
Especially your heroes.

728
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,716
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

729
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,219
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

730
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,762
That's the way it works.

731
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,598
There's a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect.

732
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,268
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

733
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,937
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

734
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:52,066
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

735
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,946
(LAUGHING) You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

736
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,865
I can't believe it.

737
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:06,080
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.
I save the best inventions for myself.

738
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,708
Am I good enough now?

739
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,794
Who's super now?

740
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,380
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

741
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,633
Oh, brilliant!

742
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,557
(COUGHING)

743
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,071
All right, try this one on for size,
big boy.

SCANNER: Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.

748
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:06,367
E: This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

749
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,705
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

750
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:15,084
Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die.

751
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,003
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

752
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:20,631
and it turned out so beautiful,
I had to continue.

753
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:24,510
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

754
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,888
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

755
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,891
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

756
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,059
That is why I show you my work.

757
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,853
That is why you are here.

758
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,695
Edna Mode.

759
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,448
And guest.

760
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,091
Come. Sit.

761
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,806
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

762
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,643
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

763
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:17,730
E: Shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

764
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,733
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

765
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:25,738
E: And can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees.

766
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,909
Completely bulletproof.

767
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,872
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

768
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,875
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

769
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,088
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

770
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,341
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

771
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,969
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

772
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,845
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

773
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,893
Your boy's suit I designed
to withstand enormous friction

774
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:59,563
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

775
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,984
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

776
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:08,447
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

777
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:16,372
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

778
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,499
and still retain its shape.

779
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,544
Virtually indestructible,

780
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:25,298
yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

781
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,968
As an extra feature,
each suit contains a homing device,

782
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:33,306
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

783
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,435
Well, darling? What do you think?

784
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:42,064
What do I think? Bob is retired!
I'm retired!

785
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,649
Our family is underground.

786
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,902
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

787
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:49,530
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

788
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,491
Why would he keep secrets from you?

789
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,202
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

790
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:59,206
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

791
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,752
- Prone to weakness.
- What are you saying?

792
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,379
Do you know where he is?

793
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:08,382
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

I was wondering if you could give me
the number of the hotel he's staying at?

01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:16,426
We can't stop it. The only thing
hard enough to penetrate it is

1227
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:21,431
itself.

1228
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:22,724
It's getting closer!

1229
01:40:22,808 --> 01:40:24,934
- It doesn't work!
- HELEN: Kids!

- Try to buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.

Honey!

1233
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:45,413
Wait a minute. Press that button again!

1234
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:49,542
No, the other one! The first one!

1235
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:50,835
First button! Got it!

1236
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,545
- It's getting closer!
- Look out!

1237
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:56,132
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.

- Not yet!

- FROZONE: Helen!
- What are you waiting for?

1240
01:41:00,638 --> 01:41:02,972
A closer target! You got one shot!

1241
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:07,018
Everybody duck!

1242

Huh? No!

1245
01:41:40,636 --> 01:41:44,514
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.

1246
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:48,768
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.

1247
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:54,607
- Just like old times. Oh!
- Just like old times.

1248
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:56,985
Yeah. Hurt then, too.

We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets.

with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

The people of this country
are indebted to you.

1252
01:42:08,998 --> 01:42:10,623
Does this mean we can
come out of hiding?

1253
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:12,750
Let the politicians figure that one out.

1254
01:42:12,835 --> 01:42:16,463
I've been asked to assure you
we'll take care of everything else.

1255
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:17,547
You did good, Bob.

Hi, this is Kari.
I have a question about Jack-Jack...

1258
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,596
Come on. We're in a limo.

1259
01:42:25,097 --> 01:42:27,640
Hey, you're wearing your hair back?

1260
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:30,560
- (STAMMERING) Yeah, I just... Yeah.
- It looks good.

1261
01:42:30,644 --> 01:42:33,313
- Thanks, Dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!

1262
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:35,648
Not as cool as you running on water.

1263
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:39,527
That was sweet when you
snagged that bad guy with your arm

1264
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:42,238
and whiplashed him into the other guy.
Sweet!

1265
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:44,991
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
- KARl: It's me.

1266
01:42:45,075 --> 01:42:48,328
Jack-Jack is fine,
but weird things are happening.

1267
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:52,040
Jack-Jack's still fine,
but I'm getting really weirded out!

1268
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,125
When are you coming back?

1269
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:56,628
...aced those guys that tried to kill us!

1270
01:42:56,712 --> 01:43:00,840
That was the best vacation ever!
I love our family.

1271

KARl: I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr!

1272
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:06,513
Put that down! Stop it!
You need to call me.

1273
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:08,598
I need help, Mrs...

1274

Bob, listen to this.

KARl: I'm gonna call the police...

1276

Hi, this is Kari.

1277
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:18,608
Sorry for freaking out,
but your baby has special needs.

1278
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,944
Thanks for sending a replacement.

1279
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:23,238
I didn't call a replacement.

1280
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:31,079
Shh. The baby is sleeping.

1281
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:36,000
You took away my future.

1282
01:43:36,085 --> 01:43:39,462
I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

1283
01:43:39,547 --> 01:43:42,757
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.

1284
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:46,511
And in time, who knows,
he might make a good sidekick.

1285
01:43:51,016 --> 01:43:54,310
He's getting away, Bob!
We have to do something now.

What's happening?

01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:20,336
- Stop him! Throw something!
- I might hit Jack-Jack.

1289
01:44:24,466 --> 01:44:25,925
Throw me.
