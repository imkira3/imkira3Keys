(ALL EX CLAIMING)

1433
01:23:49,425 --> 01:23:50,414
Ow!

1434
01:23:51,828 --> 01:23:53,659
I must leave now.

1435
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:56,960
The nature of your universe is burning me,

1436
01:23:57,033 --> 01:23:59,263
even worse than my gonorrhea.

1437
01:23:59,335 --> 01:24:01,235
You should get checked, by the way.

1438
01:24:01,304 --> 01:24:05,798
If I don't go home now, I'll shkluffocate.

1439
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:08,901
Let me go with you.
It'll be just the two of us.

1440
01:24:08,978 --> 01:24:10,809
We'll make a fire and play Uno.

1441
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,472
Fry, stop.

1442
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:15,813
- That's who we were, not who we are.
- But...

1443
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:19,844
My only consolation is that
I did find one among the quadrillions

1444
01:24:19,922 --> 01:24:21,947
who truly understands me.

1445
01:24:23,526 --> 01:24:24,720
Colleen?

1446
01:24:24,794 --> 01:24:27,957
- Wait a second, are you and Yivo...
- That's right, Fry.

1447
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,861
Thank you for introducing us.

1448
01:24:29,932 --> 01:24:33,663
Yivo has taught me
what a narrow-minded prude I was before.

1449
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:36,603
Oh, great.
So what am I supposed to do now?

1450
01:24:36,672 --> 01:24:37,730
Go home.

1451
01:24:37,807 --> 01:24:40,708
Find a girl from your own universe
and live on top of her.

1452

(EX CLAIMS)

1453
01:24:41,878 --> 01:24:43,311
Saved you.

(SIGHS)

1456
01:25:04,567 --> 01:25:06,330
Maybe Yivo was right.

1457
01:25:06,402 --> 01:25:09,599
Maybe I should look
for love closer to home.

1458
01:25:09,672 --> 01:25:13,540
- I don't know, Leela, you think maybe...
- Oh, please.

1459
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:16,169
You forgot me quick enough
when you met Colleen.

1460
01:25:16,245 --> 01:25:17,644
That's true.

1461
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:20,147
- How about you, Amy?
- (SCOFFS) Fry...

1462
01:25:20,216 --> 01:25:23,049
- I'm Kif's Fonfon Ru.
- Are you?

1463
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:26,282
Well, then perhaps you misunderstood
the meaning of the term.

1464
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:29,813
It means, "One who doesn't sleep
with my superior officer."

1465
01:25:29,892 --> 01:25:31,723
That's the literal translation.

1466
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:35,321
Give the poor girl a break, Kif.
It's not like she had a dictionary.

1467
01:25:35,398 --> 01:25:37,889
She was butt naked, for God's sakes.

1468

(GROANS)

1469
01:25:39,702 --> 01:25:41,863
So, Wernstrom,

1470
01:25:41,938 --> 01:25:45,965
did you happen to notice
those mighty cables Bender used on Yivo?

1471
01:25:46,042 --> 01:25:47,509
Pure diamondium.

1472
01:25:47,576 --> 01:25:51,273
More like pure crap-crapium.
No wonder Yivo got away.

(WHISTLE BLOWING)

1477
01:26:00,957 --> 01:26:02,720
Captain on deck.

1478
01:26:02,792 --> 01:26:04,487
At ease, buckos.

1479
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,552
Bender, why did you do it?
We were all so happy.

1480
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:08,961
And we were in love.

1481
01:26:09,031 --> 01:26:12,467
- (SCOFFS) That wasn't love.
- What? How can you say that?

1482
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:15,026
Because Bender knows love.

1483
01:26:15,104 --> 01:26:18,369
And love doesn't share itself
with the world.

1484
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:21,467
Love is suspicious, love is needy,

1485
01:26:21,544 --> 01:26:24,570
love is fearful, love is greedy.

1486
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:30,443
My friends, there is no great love
without great jealousy.

1487
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:34,855
I love you, meatbags.

twenty-fourth century on his ass
