2
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,645
I don't know how you talked
me into this, Tommy.

3
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,395
Hell, I must be crazy, heh.

4
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,697
You know...

5
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,449
if the institution ever
found out about this...

6
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,703
they would haul our butts
back in in straitjackets.

7
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,159
- Permanent.
- You didn't have to come, Hawes.

8
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:16,043
- This is between me and Jason.
- I know, I know, I know.

9
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,920
But I still don't get
the therapy here.

10
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,798
All you need to know is
Jason's dead, right, heh?

11
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:25,552
Seeing his corpse ain't gonna
stop the hallucinations.

12
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,214
Seeing it won't,
but destroying it will.

13
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:33,344
Jason belongs in hell, and
I'm gonna see he gets there.

14
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,367
Okay, there it is, huh, heh?

15
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,670
There's his grave.

16
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,962
- Okay, let's go.
- Wait a second.

17
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,096
What?

18
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,928
I gotta be sure.

19
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:40,434
Okay. There's your proof.
There's his coffin. Let's go.

20
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,809
- Hand me the crowbar.
- You're not gonna open that.

21
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,319
Hand me the crowbar.

22
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,148
I got it.

23
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,033
I really don't like this.

24
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,719
<i>Die!</i>

25
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,435
<i>- Die!
- Tommy!</i>

26
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,639
<i>Die!</i>

27
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,730
<i>- Tommy!
- Die!</i>

28
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,611
<i>Tommy. Tommy, get the
hell out of here!</i>

29
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,153
Where are you going?

30
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,453
Hey, what's that for?

31
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,459
Tommy, what are you doing?

32
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,255
Oh, shit.

33
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,773
Oh, boy.

34
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,151
He must've really messed you over.

35
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,830
Yeah, fuck you, Jason.

36
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,454
What are you doing?

37
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:50,703
Tommy. Would you just
leave that thing alone?

38
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,542
Please.

39
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:07,474
Tommy, please. Let's get out of here.
My heart can't take any more of this.

40
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,129
Hawes!

41
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,500
- Don't shoot. Please.
- You in show business, kid?

42
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,840
- You sure know how to make an entrance.
- Look, you gotta do something.

43
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,588
Jason's alive. He killed my friend,

44
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:31,637
- now he's coming for me.
- You better cool out, boy.

45
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:33,856
- You almost got your head blown off.
- Will you listen, dammit?

46
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:37,779
Don't piss me off, junior or I will
repaint this office with your brains.

47
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,902
Look, Jason is alive.
We dug up his body.

48
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:44,895
- I was gonna cremate it.
- Hold it. What's your name, son?

49
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,029
Tommy Jarvis. But look,
we've gotta do something.

50
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,565
He's even more powerful now...

51
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,151
Aren't you the kid whose mother and
friends were killed by that maniac?

52
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,614
Yeah. Jason murdered them.

53
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,779
You've been in some
psychiatric clinic ever since.

54
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,044
What the hell's going
on with the weather?

55
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,952
- Sorry. I didn't know you had...
- No problem, Rick.

56
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,713
I want you to meet a former
resident here, Tommy Jarvis.

57
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,593
- He's got some kind of prank...
- There's no time for this bullshit!

58
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,714
- Jason's gotta be stopped!
- What prank, Mike?

59
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,096
- Hey. Hey!
- Unh!

60
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,271
That's what's known in the books as
"screwing the pooch." Iron this punk.

61
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:18,307
No, wait. You gotta listen to me.
Jason's coming here. He's after me!

62
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,598
- I tried to destroy him, but I fucked up.
- You got that right, punk.

63
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,151
You listen to me. I'm sorry about what
happened to you and your folks years ago...

64
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,433
but no one in Forest Green
wants to be reminded...

65
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:30,615
of what that maniac did here.
That's why we changed the name.

66
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,741
People wanna forget
this was Crystal Lake.

67
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,404
They don't need some kid
stirring up Jason shit again.

68
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,664
Now, you just lie down
and get some rest.

69
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,916
- In the morning, I'll call that clinic.
- No.

70
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,915
If you just go to the cemetery,
you'll see I'm not lying.

71
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,832
Either you get some sleep, or I'm
gonna come in there and put you out.

72
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,217
You're gonna be sorry
you didn't listen to me.

73
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,257
You're gonna be sorry
if you don't shut up.

74
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,547
Take a nap, junior.

75
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,241
Take it easy. It's hard
enough to read this thing.

76
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,623
- Well, who told me to take this cowpath?
- Wait a minute.

77
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,744
You admit the sign did say Camp Forest
Green with an arrow pointing this way?

78
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,255
I admit nothing without
talking to my lawyer.

79
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,493
I told you we should've left
a trail of bread crumbs.

80
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:30,612
Don't start.

81
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,843
So much for the head counselors ever
getting back to the camp on their own.

82
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,009
I say we stop the car, get out
and start screaming for help.

83
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:44,807
- I was just kidding, Lizbeth.
- Darren, we'd better turn around.

84
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,646
- Why?
- Because I've seen enough...

85
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,403
horror movies to know any weirdo
wearing a mask is never friendly.

86
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,997
Whoa!

87
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,457
There's no way that we can do this.

88
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,244
If the car drops into that
gully, we'll never get it out.

89
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,379
Do you have a better suggestion?

90
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,962
Yeah.

91
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,797
We're gonna scare him.

92
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,803
- We're gonna scare him?
- That's right.

93
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,714
Just drive towards him. He'll move.

94
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,258
- Nobody wants to die.
- Well, that's a freaking fact.

95
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,665
- Least of all us.
- Just drive.

96
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,058
He'll get out of our way.

97
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,742
Yeah. That really scared
the shit out of him.

98
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,370
- Oh, no.
- That's it.

99
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,709
We're driving this baby
back to town in reverse.

100
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:51,998
The hell we are.

101
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,132
- Where'd you get that?
- Don't worry about it.

102
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,468
- Just stay cool.
- Stay cool?

103
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,474
You ain't Dirty Harry.
Now, stop it.

104
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,060
All right, scumbag.
Get out of the road.

105
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,107
Now.

106
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,861
Darren, get back in here
right now. He'll kill you.

107
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,991
Not if I get him first.

108
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,378
No, no.

109
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,767
No!

110
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,180
Please.

111
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,104
Please, wait a second.

112
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,860
Please. Take these...

113
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,942
Please.

114
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,986
You can have the...

115
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,028
Come on, Dad. You can at
least have Rick drive out...

116
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,238
and look for them.

117
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,745
Megan, my deputy has more
important things to do...

118
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,201
than look for camp
counselors with car trouble.

119
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,913
Come on. Can't you put out
an all points bulletin?

120
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,295
- That would be wicked decent.
- Your mother own a sewing machine, kid?

121
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,794
- Excuse me?
- Hey, off.

122
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,547
Oh, hey. Sorry.

123
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,096
Darren and my sister
Lizbeth are in charge...

124
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,303
of organizing the new campgrounds
and we don't know what to do.

125
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,595
And all the kiddies arrive today.
We're not ready to deal with that.

126
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,263
I sympathize with you kids.

127
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,151
Best I can do is call the station in
Carpenter and have them keep a lookout.

128
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,437
I've got a bad feeling
what might've happened.

129
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,072
Hopefully they're fine,
but with Jason out there...

130
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,983
- Shut up.
- Jason who?

131
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,494
Megan, stay away from him.
He's dangerous.

132
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,871
I'm not dangerous.
Jason is out there.

133
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,284
He's looking for me. He's
probably headed back to the camp.

134
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,997
I told you to shut up.

135
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,083
You mean the Jason of Camp Blood?

136
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,872
- Yes.
- No.

137
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,212
You kids better leave.

138
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,469
This boy is not well and I need
to talk to him in private.

139
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,301
- Come on, Dad. We were just...
- Megan.

140
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,090
Take your friends back to the camp.

141
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,759
I'll let you know if I hear
anything about your camp leaders.

142
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,054
Don't beat him up
too bad. He's cute.

143
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,222
Megan, leave.

144
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,267
Ooh. He's cute.

145
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,722
I was gonna call that clinic
and have them collect your ass

146
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:12,618
but I don't want you
here any longer,

147
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:15,267
poisoning my daughter or anyone else,
with your warped sense of humor.

148
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:19,648
They have to be warned, sheriff. Jason
will return to the area that's familiar.

149
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:23,675
No matter what you call it, it's
still Camp Crystal Lake to him.

150
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,464
We're gonna escort you to the
edge of my jurisdiction.

151
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,309
Then we will say goodbye and we'll
never see you around here again.

152
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,014
Do we understand each other?

153
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,360
Shit. Shit. Damn.

154
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,067
I know I'm gonna get
blamed for this.

155
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,034
Say old Martin ain't
a good caretaker.

156
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,571
Hell, I'm a damn high
school graduate.

157
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,786
And I deserve this job.
I earned it.

158
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,793
Nobody's gonna find out.

159
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,081
Shitheads couldn't even
stick him back in right.

160
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,548
Well, I ain't gonna
touch the slimy sucker.

161
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,722
Why'd they have to
go and dig up Jason?

162
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:14,769
Some folks have a strange
idea of entertainment.

163
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,070
Hey, you guys. You guys,
I'm getting worried.

164
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,954
- About Jason? Ooh.
- No, about Darren and Lizbeth.

165
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,410
They should've at least
called, don't you think?

166
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,825
- Megan?
- What?

167
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,210
- Hello?
- Yeah, heh.

168
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,714
This girl's back in the jail
cell with her prisoner of love.

169
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,375
Aw. Ha, ha.

170
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,714
Don't be messing with no
crazy jailbird, girl.

171
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,255
- Those dudes are bad news.
- Oh, and how do you know?

172
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,844
I been around long enough
to see plenty on TV.

173
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,102
- TV?
- Yeah. Heh.

174
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,015
I don't know about that guy, Megan.

175
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,434
He seemed pretty weird
with all that Jason stuff.

176
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,446
You know what you need? I've been telling you
this forever. You need a guy like me, eh?

177
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,483
- Guy who's not so twisted.
- Maybe he was telling the truth.

178
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,276
Just because our parents
keep telling us...

179
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,617
that Jason was only a legend
doesn't mean it wasn't true.

180
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,041
What if he did come back here...

181
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:23,872
looking for the camp counselor that
caused him to drown as a boy...

182
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:30,303
searching for the one that
decapitated his vengeful mother?

183
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,341
And you do know what today's
date is, don't you?

184
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:41,227
And I can think of only one
thing even more terrifying.

185
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,857
What?

186
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,780
The kids are here.

187
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,199
Yeah, right!

188
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,702
Be careful. You may fall.

189
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,998
Here they are.
And they're all yours.

190
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,048
Think I'd rather
deal with old Jason.

191
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,995
Once we nail Roy,
that's it. Victory is ours.

192
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,657
It's taking forever. I'm starving.

193
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,200
That's your trouble, Larry.

194
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,460
That's why your sales are
always behind quota.

195
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,713
Your instinct to eat is stronger
than your instinct to win.

196
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:51,342
- You're a real ass, you know that?
- Better than being all ass.

197
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,131
- Oh. That is so unfair.
- Oh, here we go with unfair again.

198
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,800
- War is not fair.
- Give me a break, would you, please?

199
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,560
- This is not war. This is a game.
- War is an ugly thing.

200
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,768
- I'm hungry. I wanna get a sandwich.
- Wait till we kill something, then you can eat.

201
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,557
Calm down, would you?

202
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,318
- You're an insurance salesman.
- Death is my business.

203
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,526
You become this whole other
person when we're out here, Stan.

204
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,737
- I don't like it.
- Hey, this is a man's game.

205
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,824
Requires a man's cunning.
A man's intelligence...

206
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,993
Fuck!

207
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,376
- With a woman's touch.
- Now, wait a minute!

208
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,834
- I thought Burt shot you!
- See any paint?

209
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,084
Sorry, guys. I did in Mr.
Commando, weapons and all.

210
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,925
Survival's the name of the
game and that flag is mine.

211
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:42,101
I can't believe this.
Burt never gets shot.

212
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,229
- Never should've let her play.
- It's a damn company exec game...

213
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,934
and she's a damn company exec.

214
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:52,024
Now, now, boys. Don't be spoilsports.
Put on your headbands.

215
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:07,209
Dumb broad. She tricked me.

216
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,042
God, they're gonna
laugh for months.

217
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,961
She should've stayed in the
kitchen where she belongs.

218
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,844
A woman shouldn't even be
allowed in these games.

219
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,843
It's not a game. It's life.

220
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,199
Jason really screwed up that
poor son of a bitch's mind.

221
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,535
He really believes that Jason's
still alive, doesn't he?

222
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,792
That's not what worries me.

223
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,952
It's how far he'll go
to try and prove it.

224
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,284
Darn.

225
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,918
Oh, no.

226
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,048
No.

227
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,213
Oh, my God. No.

228
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,882
What...? Come...

229
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:50,104
Where...? Oh, no. Oh, no. God.

230
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,481
Come on out, you guys!
The game's over.

231
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,108
You don't know. What about Roy?

232
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,859
- Nobody's seen him.
- Of course not.

233
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,897
If he hasn't accidentally pelleted
himself, I'm sure he's lost.

234
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,407
- Well, the game's not over till it's over.
- That's right.

235
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,782
Shh.

236
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,373
Wait a second. What was that?

237
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,158
- What?
- Nothing.

238
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,327
I could swear I heard something.

239
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,916
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, God.

240
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,173
Be quiet.

241
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,981
Oh, my God. My God.

242
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,445
Help, guys! Help me!

243
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,862
Help!

244
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,532
Oh, no. Help me, guys! Help!

245
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,744
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

246
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,666
Oh, God. Help me. Somebody help me!

247
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,800
He's gonna kill me.

248
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,812
Fucking-A, what did I tell you?
Hit the noise and the cherries.

249
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,711
Sheriff. Sheriff, wait.

250
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:26,969
- You gotta listen.
- I'm tired of listening to you, kid.

251
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,095
I gotta... I gotta show
you Jason's grave.

252
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,177
I've seen it. Come on, get up!

253
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,513
- Get up!
- Please, sheriff.

254
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,302
You'll see we dug it up.

255
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:39,190
Well, he must've got chilly in the
night and pulled the dirt back over.

256
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,772
That's not right.
Somebody covered it over.

257
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,313
- I gotta see it.
- Freeze it, psycho.

258
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,402
Now see what you've done.

259
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,316
You made my deputy
draw his revolver.

260
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:52,236
He's been dying to try out
his mail-order laser scope.

261
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,702
Wherever the red dot
goes, you bang.

262
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,287
- What's the problem, sheriff?
- No problem, Martin.

263
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,498
Just a vagrant kid.
We got it under control.

264
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:03,505
- Did you cover up Jason's grave?
- What are you talking about?

265
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,917
Don't concern yourself.
This kid needs treatment.

266
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,927
Jason's not in his grave,
Hawes is. Dig it up!

267
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:13,011
You gotta dig it up!
You gotta dig it up!

268
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,644
Dig him up?

269
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,603
Does he think I'm a farthead?

270
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,946
Yeah!

271
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:31,780
Okay. Is this gonna be
the best weekend ever?

272
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,242
Yeah!

273
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,121
- Are we gonna go fishing?
- Yeah!

274
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,286
- Are we gonna scare all the boys?
- Yeah!

275
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:45,297
Okay. Are we gonna, uh...?

276
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,959
Are we gonna not eat
Brussels sprouts?

277
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,673
- Yeah!
- What happened to Cort?

278
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,133
Are you ready?

279
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,641
He's taken the young men off to
teach them my favorite sport.

280
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,769
- Heh, which is?
- Boy Scouting, honey.

281
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,430
Heh. Cort? You've gotta be kidding.

282
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,019
You gotta be kidding.

283
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,810
Listen, you obviously don't
know anything about Indians.

284
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:09,822
Probably none of you do. Look, here's the
story. These are called Indian markers.

285
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,153
Let's just say you have
a chief, all right?

286
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,489
And he dumps his squaw
or his wife or whatever.

287
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:18,030
He decides, "I'm gonna pick up with
another woman and take off with her."

288
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,370
He takes off, leaving his
son with the mother.

289
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,500
A week or two later, the son
wants to catch up with his dad.

290
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,333
He wants to learn how to
shoot a bow, kill a buffalo.

291
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,497
So, what happens is
he comes along...

292
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,417
sees the rocks, says, "Dad,
he went that way," obviously.

293
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,463
He knocks them all down before
the mother catches up...

294
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,973
because he doesn't wanna
see any of her anymore.

295
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,010
Pretty much, that's the basic
story. It tells you where to go.

296
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:42,897
If this is exciting as it gets,
we're in big trouble, dude.

297
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,736
Let's go.

298
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,616
Like the sign says, you are
now leaving Forest Green.

299
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,534
Don't forget to buckle up.
You are damn lucky, kid.

300
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,417
With all the grief
you've given me...

301
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,170
you should be leaving wearing
your balls as earrings.

302
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,253
And if I ever see you around here
again, you can guarantee it.

303
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,799
Let's get the hell
out of here, Rick.

304
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:32,067
<i>Take you home again, Kathleen</i>

305
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,231
<i>To where...</i>

306
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:39,532
<i>Your heart will feel no pain</i>

307
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,783
<i>I'll take you home again</i>

308
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,753
Steven, it's beautiful.

309
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,085
God, I love it. I really do.

310
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,010
I don't know. I mean,
you know, I'm sort of hurt.

311
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:58,593
You thought I brought you up
here just to... Ah, never mind.

312
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,508
Yeah, well, I guess I do owe you.

313
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,770
Yeah. No, look. I have a headache
and I've been working out.

314
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,057
- Mm-hm. Ah.
- I'm... I'm sore...

315
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,225
- And...
- Yeah. Right. Forget about it.

316
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,315
Well, it's a messy act and...

317
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,024
- What the heck.
- Great.

318
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,035
<i>Again, Kathleen</i>

319
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,615
Oh.

320
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,289
Where'd the road go?

321
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,451
I can't find the road.

322
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,120
Where's the road?

323
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,091
Kathleen, you led me astray.

324
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,720
What's that? What's that?

325
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,261
Huh?

326
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,860
Darling, you're gonna
be the death of me.

327
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:04,826
Yeah, but what a way to go, huh?

328
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,675
- Stay here.
- Steven, please.

329
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,139
- Stay here.
- No, Steven. Don't.

330
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,705
Steven. Steven, what's going on?

331
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,207
- Annette, let's go.
- Okay.

332
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,039
Never mind.

333
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,759
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta get to the sheriff's office.

334
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,087
- Pick a card.
- I don't wanna play anymore, Sissy.

335
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:46,928
- Oh, come on. Pick a card.
- No, I really don't.

336
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,555
Okay. Okay. I've got a great game.

337
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,766
It's called Camp Blood.

338
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,271
- Great.
- Yeah.

339
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,400
The object of the game is, first
you take this jack of spades...

340
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:57,901
which is Jason, right?

341
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,404
And then you have all these face
cards, which represent counselors.

342
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,782
The queen of hearts is me.

343
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,490
- Now, who do you wanna be?
- Oh, come on, Sissy.

344
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,495
Okay, you be the queen of diamonds.

345
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:13,204
What you do is you shuffle Jason
up in these cards here...

346
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:18,042
and you put them in piles, because
the piles represent cabins.

347
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:23,587
Now, the object of the game is to
find out which cabin Jason is in.

348
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,800
Did Megan say when
she's coming back?

349
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,135
Of course not. You wanna
bet she took him...

350
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,018
a loaf of bread with
a saw hidden in it?

351
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,434
I'm gonna call her.

352
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,934
Hopefully her dad has found out what's
happened to Darren and Lizbeth.

353
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,978
I say if they're not here by
morning, we send the kids home.

354
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,737
We're not prepared to run this...

355
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,005
- She saw a monster!
- Who did?

356
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,137
- It's okay. We're here.
- Yeah, honey, we're here.

357
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,094
- So, what happened?
- There was this monster.

358
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:13,807
And he was after me and
he wanted to kill me.

359
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,435
- Where?
- He was everywhere.

360
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,975
- Oh, you mean you had a bad dream.
- No.

361
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,439
It was real, just like on TV.

362
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,855
Okay, listen, sweetie.
What's your name?

363
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,240
- Nancy.
- Well, Nancy...

364
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:31,029
I'm Paula, remember?
And this is Sissy.

365
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:35,324
And we're gonna be right out there all
night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?

366
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:40,125
So no more bad dreams can
come around here, huh?

367
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,546
Good. Okay, lay down.

368
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,879
There. Okay?

369
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,055
Okay.

370
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,852
Hey, wait a minute, where's Cort?
I haven't seen him for hours.

371
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,235
I don't know. He called somebody,
then he just took off.

372
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:07,398
Said something about checking out
things that go bump in the night.

373
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,374
You're the best. The best.

374
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,134
You gotta keep it up to
the end of this song.

375
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,427
How much longer?

376
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,759
It's only 10 more minutes.

377
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,965
- Fuck!
- Oh, yeah.

378
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,504
Wait a sec and I'll...

379
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,220
Cort, you didn't already?

380
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,430
Oh, come on, wasn't that
the end of the song?

381
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,686
Great, just great.

382
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,613
If this thing is burned out, frigging
Horace is gonna have my butt.

383
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,024
- Who's Horace?
- My frigging stepfather...

384
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,613
and asshole in residence.

385
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,205
Ah. Now, how'd that happen?

386
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,741
What?

387
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,960
Will you go out and
plug the cord back in?

388
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,169
- Who unplugged the cord?
- Smokey the Bear. I don't know. Go do it.

389
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:52,928
- Do you know how cold it is out there, Nikki?
- I don't give a shit, Cort. Go do it!

390
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,057
You're a real pain in the ass.
A major pain in the ass.

391
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,936
Will you hurry up? I gotta get this
back before Horace finds out I took it.

392
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,188
Hurry up.

393
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,353
- Will you come on?
- All right.

394
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,398
I'm going. I'm going, okay?

395
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,450
God, shut the hell up.

396
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,774
- What...?
- Cort.

397
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,656
- Nikki.
- What are you doing?

398
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,948
- Look at this.
- What happened to it?

399
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,084
I don't know, but I say unless you
wanna look exactly like it...

400
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,620
we make this place a
memory right now.

401
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,766
Nikki, somebody's out there.

402
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:29,809
- What if it's that guy Jason?
- I don't wanna know.

403
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,865
- No way. This isn't happening.
- You're right, it isn't.

404
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:48,709
- You gonna drive or not?
- Whoo! Out of here.

405
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,674
Shit! Damn it, Cort.

406
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,924
Shit!

407
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,309
Go!

408
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,061
Shit! Cort!

409
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,727
Whoo! Boy, this baby jams.

410
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,238
Let me tell you, for a big
truck, it's not bad at all.

411
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,950
That's it! Pull over, I'm driving.

412
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,906
No way, babe, I wanna rock!

413
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,658
Yeah! Whoo.

414
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,202
Whoo. This is... This is great!

415
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:34,339
I've never driven a house before.
I like this. This is great.

416
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:53,521
Sounds like you're having fun back there.
What are you doing? Need some company?

417
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,399
Ooh, that sounds great.

418
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,364
Do you need some
company or what, huh?

419
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,654
Cort!

420
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,575
Whoo! This is great. I am
having such a good time.

421
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,338
Ha, ha. This is great!

422
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,672
Hey, Nikki, what are you doing
back there, taking a dump?

423
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,013
Mind if I come back
and snatch a peek?

424
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,270
Or vice versa?

425
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,659
Whoo! Yeah!

426
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,326
Nikki, listen to this.

427
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,455
What makes you so high and mighty?

428
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,958
You keep forgetting, little
Megan, I'm the parent.

429
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,790
You're the child.

430
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,795
When are you gonna stop
treating me like one?

431
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:41,693
When you stop acting like one.
Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy.

432
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:44,973
Oh, how do you know, Dad? What'd
you do, take his temperature?

433
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:47,326
Better watch that
smart-mouthing, young lady.

434
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,599
"If your mother were
still alive..."

435
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,807
That's it. Out. I don't need
this tonight. Out, Megan.

436
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,891
Sheriff's office.

437
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,435
Oh, I'm sorry, he can't come
to the phone right now.

438
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,400
He's in the can draining his lizard.
May I take a message?

439
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:06,316
Oops, here he comes
now. Please hold.

440
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,194
- It's Rick.
- What?

441
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:12,243
- What kind of problem?
- You better get the hell down here.

442
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,373
I found what's left of
those counselors...

443
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,503
and it looks like someone did
them in using Jason's old MO.

444
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,340
I knew I should have done
something about that son of a...

445
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,171
Where are you?

446
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:29,176
- Right, I'm on my way.
- What is it?

447
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,684
Seems your boyfriend wants people
to believe Jason has returned.

448
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,436
- I thought Jason was just a legend.
- That's right.

449
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,689
Only, Tommy wants to prove
the legend is true.

450
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:42,068
Now, you stay put.
And I'm not kidding.

451
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:56,635
Sheriff's office.

452
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,554
I'm sorry, he's not in.
Can I take a message?

453
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:03,775
Oh, hi. This is his daughter, Megan.
I met you this morning, remember?

454
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:07,104
Yeah, hi. Listen, I've gotta talk
to your dad about... About Jason.

455
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,274
I've got a plan. But first I
need to buy some supplies and...

456
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,783
Tommy, my father's out
looking for you right now.

457
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:16,037
Something happened tonight and he's
sure you're responsible for it.

458
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,165
- If he finds you, he's gonna...
- Yeah, he made that real clear.

459
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,996
Megan, Jason is out there.

460
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,662
I'm positive he's headed back
to the camp. He's gonna...

461
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,498
- Where are you? I'll come pick you up.
- What?

462
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:29,209
It's the only way. If my
father sees you in your car...

463
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,216
he's gonna nail you in
a second. Where are you?

464
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,680
Uh, Karloff's General
something, um...

465
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:38,886
I know just where it is. I'll see
you in a half-hour, heh. Whoo!

466
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,394
Megan.

467
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,562
- Okay, lift it, ugh.
- Ugh.

468
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,901
I want all officers, units and
stations within a 50-mile radius...

469
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,066
- alerted about this wacko kid.
- Yes, sir.

470
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,611
You have his vehicle description.
I want roadblocks.

471
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:40,326
- Sheriff, get over here!
- Shit, now what?

472
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,203
Come on.

473
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,872
Mike, over here.

474
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,759
Is that all you found?

475
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,758
I wish it was.

476
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,316
I'll order up some body bags.

477
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,479
Our boy sure wants us
to believe his story.

478
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:15,774
Well, he picked the right
day to pull this shit.

479
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,567
What do you mean?

480
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,702
Happy Friday the 13th.

481
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,458
All right, who's out there?

482
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,961
What's going on?

483
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,640
Think I hear somebody
fooling around out there.

484
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:27,645
It's gotta be Cort. You know how
he loves to try and scare us, heh.

485
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,931
Teach him a lesson.

486
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:45,222
You guys, try not to wake the kids.

487
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,146
I'm gonna borrow your car.

488
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,110
You can't do this.
It's too dangerous.

489
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,698
You gonna talk about dangerous?
You wanna leave that truck in plain sight?

490
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,112
Hide it behind the store
and let's get out of here.

491
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,906
Look, this isn't a game.
You're not going with me.

492
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,574
I'm already responsible for...

493
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,788
You said you needed
some supplies, right?

494
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,669
- Yes, but I...
- Then let's get going.

495
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:19,173
We can argue about it on the way.
Tell me what you need and I'll get it.

496
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,675
- Megan...
- Besides, nobody drives this puppy but me.

497
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,257
Now, hide that heap and let's book.

498
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,960
- Can't this tub go any faster?
- You got it.

499
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:08,139
- You just keep your eye out for roadblocks.
- Okay. There's one.

500
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,472
Get down.

501
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:24,314
Hey! Hey!

502
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,833
Unit 45, Officer Pappas to
Sheriff Garris, do you copy?

503
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,423
- Yeah.
- We've got a different vehicle...

504
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,335
that took off when they saw us.
I saw somebody duck down.

505
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,172
- Got a description or plates?
- I got the whole enchilada.

506
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:53,559
It's a '77 orange Camaro. License
number Mary, William, 85-10.

507
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,186
That's my daughter's car.

508
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,350
Uh, how do you want
us to proceed, sir?

509
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,143
With extreme care, asshole.

510
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,939
If that kid is with her, there's every
good chance he'll do something crazy.

511
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,072
Please, don't do anything crazy.

512
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,083
I know what I'm doing. I got
you your supplies, didn't I?

513
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,963
If I can just get us to
Cunningham Road, I can lose them.

514
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,053
Stay down.

515
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,893
Whatever you say.

516
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,186
That's what I want.

517
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,924
This is gonna be a
hairy turn. Hang on.

518
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:06,336
Megan, step out of the car.

519
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,050
End of the line.

520
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,755
Oh, shit.

521
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,044
Paula, I can't sleep. I'm scared.

522
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,305
I saw someone at my window.

523
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:58,263
- Where did you get this?
- I found it outside.

524
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:03,306
Ah, you know what? Sissy and
Cort are playing jokes.

525
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,315
You know, trying to
scare each other.

526
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:06,893
- Why?
- Well...

527
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:09,479
because grownups think
it's funny to be scared.

528
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:12,694
- What?
- Heh, never mind.

529
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,910
I can't believe it's that
late. No one called.

530
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:19,822
- I better...
- Who you calling?

531
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,997
Why don't we go and find
Sissy and Cort first.

532
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,628
Then you can go to bed.

533
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:30,667
- Wait. What if they try to scare us?
- Well, we'll scare them right back.

534
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,676
- Okay, heh.
- Okay, heh.

535
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,387
Let's go. Let's find them.

536
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,309
I said, shut up!

537
00:53:54,335 --> 00:53:56,525
All he's asking you to
do is just check it out.

538
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,529
- You've got me where you want me.
- If I had you where I wanted you...

539
00:53:59,555 --> 00:54:02,069
they'd be pumping your
ass full of formaldehyde.

540
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:05,077
Why don't you at least call the camp,
make sure everything's all right.

541
00:54:05,151 --> 00:54:07,816
We have, trying to track you down.
The phone there's disconnected.

542
00:54:07,842 --> 00:54:10,312
- Doesn't that tell you something?
- Yeah, they should've paid their bill.

543
00:54:10,338 --> 00:54:11,407
Sheriff.

544
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,549
You just sit tight, Jason.
As soon as the authorities...

545
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:18,965
- from Carpenter get here...
- Sheriff! You better take this.

546
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,055
Sheriff Garris.

547
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,393
What time?

548
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,021
I'll be right there.

549
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,240
- What's happened?
- Rick.

550
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,662
Keep an eye on this wacko.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

551
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,159
What's going on?

552
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,741
Make sure my daughter
stays put. She's grounded.

553
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:46,543
Tell me!

554
00:54:46,569 --> 00:54:48,944
They just found your
friend Cort and some girl.

555
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:52,923
Her head was crushed in and Cort, he
had a knife rammed through his skull.

556
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:54,629
No.

557
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:58,759
Tommy Jarvis is a
psychopathic killer.

558
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,591
- He wants you to believe that...
- It was Jason.

559
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,135
Sheriff, when did it happen?

560
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:09,144
For God's sake, Meggie,
stay away from him, please.

561
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,272
- What time did this happen?
- What difference does that make?

562
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,278
- What time?
- Eight-thirty, 9:00. Why?

563
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,028
Tommy was with me
all that time, Dad.

564
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,500
Rick...

565
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,628
I'll call you from there.
Lock him up.

566
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,338
Okay, flash, into the cage.

567
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,320
I'm sure Sissy and Cort are
back in their cabins by now.

568
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:59,197
So you just go back to
sleep and don't worry.

569
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,821
But what if I get scared again?

570
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,327
Shh!

571
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,659
You know what I used to do when
I was a little girl and I got scared?

572
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:10,042
I would close my eyes and
say a little prayer.

573
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,172
And you know what? Pretty soon,
everything scary went away.

574
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:19,005
It worked for me. I bet it'll
work for you too, heh.

575
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,171
- Good night.
- Good night.

576
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,390
See you in the morning.

577
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,559
Cort?

578
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:52,845
Sissy?

579
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,008
No!

580
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,724
- No.
- Yes.

581
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:16,910
So, what are you drawing?

582
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,457
So, what's it to you?

583
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,413
Pipe down, Jarvis!

584
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,920
I was just curious as to
what she's drawing, is all.

585
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,502
There, you happy?

586
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,759
- No.
- Why?

587
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,837
Because it stinks.

588
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,684
- Okay, give it back.
- Come and get it.

589
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:44,813
I'll get it for you, babe.

590
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,648
Come and get it.

591
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,897
Give it back, punk!

592
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:07,464
Hey!

593
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:11,126
Hey, hey! Get your
hands off her, animal.

594
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:14,513
You little turd! I ought
to punch you silly.

595
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,466
Let him out of there, Rick.

596
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,677
Megan.

597
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,637
Don't clown around.

598
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,726
I'm not the one with
the funny red nose.

599
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:27,435
Now, open the cell and let him out.

600
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,653
Meggie.

601
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,813
I'm not kidding.

602
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,823
You better do as she says...

603
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:37,452
because wherever the red
dot goes, you bang.

604
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,955
You son of a bitch!

605
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:03,016
You're really screwing
up here, missy.

606
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,981
Don't do this, Megan!

607
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,892
Megan!

608
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:13,488
- I thought he took your key.
- He did.

609
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,901
- But I've got my hide-a-key.
- Not this time.

610
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,661
- Hey, wait a minute.
- I appreciate you getting me out...

611
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,947
but I have to finish
what I started here.

612
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:34,877
Come on, hot lips, let's go.
You drive, I'll navigate.

613
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:56,774
Let me know when we're about to blast
into hyperspace. I'll fasten my seatbelt.

614
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,534
I got a bad feeling
we're already too late.

615
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,995
Are you sure this is gonna work?

616
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,535
Why didn't we just bring
the gun and blow him away?

617
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:12,627
The only way now to stop Jason is to
return him to his original resting place.

618
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,962
Where he drowned in 1957.

619
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:18,755
- Lake Forest Green.
- Crystal Lake.

620
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,764
Where this nightmare began.

621
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:31,953
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

622
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:36,339
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

623
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:38,858
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

624
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:43,506
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

625
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:56,018
- So, what's the story here?
- Why don't you boys nose around.

626
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:59,154
I gotta break the news to Megan's
friends about what's happened.

627
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,155
- Holler if you see anything.
- Like what?

628
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:05,364
Anything that don't belong.
And don't wake the kids.

629
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:09,948
Come on, handsome.

630
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,878
Girls?

631
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,837
It's Sheriff Garris.

632
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,312
Hey!

633
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,755
Oh, my God.

634
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:03,069
All right, come on out of there.

635
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,197
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

636
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:18,581
Come on out of there.

637
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:43,360
Hey, hey, hey. What are you
doing running around out here?

638
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:47,276
- Now, you go on back to bed.
- No! No, there's a scary man!

639
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,440
Oh, what scary man?

640
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,851
No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. Everything's all right.

641
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,479
Everything's okay,
honey. It's okay.

642
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,522
Come on, boys, let's go.

643
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,874
Come on, kids. Come on.

644
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:42,915
Now, I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

645
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:45,580
I want you to all lie down
on the floor under the beds.

646
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:50,469
Do not get up until I come back. Do you
understand? Now, move, hurry. Come on.

647
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,338
Come on.

648
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,424
Fuck!

649
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:50,797
- See, they did show up.
- Yeah.

650
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,587
We'll have to take...

651
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,798
Megan, wait!

652
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:08,223
Oh, God. Dad! Daddy!

653
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:26,161
It's okay. It's me, Megan.
Don't be afraid. It's okay.

654
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:29,544
Shh, everything's gonna be
all right. Don't be afraid.

655
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,043
- Is everyone okay?
- They're fine. They're fine.

656
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:36,210
It's okay. Everything's
gonna be just fine, okay?

657
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:16,424
I'm gonna go find my daddy, the sheriff,
and then we can all go home, okay?

658
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:19,468
Now, uh, go back and lie down
where you were before...

659
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,846
and stay there. Go ahead.

660
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,473
And we'll come back and get you.

661
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,680
I promise. Go lie down. Stay there.

662
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:28,345
What do you think?

663
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,934
I think we're dead meat.

664
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,441
Daddy!

665
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:42,033
Dad, answer me!

666
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:43,655
Dad, where are you?

667
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,455
Megan! Use your dad's
radio! Call for help!

668
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:48,872
And an ambulance!

669
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,508
Oh, God.

670
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:02,800
Stop it!

671
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,258
Daddy, where are you?

672
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:12,689
Daddy, please come to help us!

673
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:14,857
Daddy!

674
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:20,692
Real dead meat.

675
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:24,450
So, what were you gonna
be when you grew up?

676
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,954
Daddy, where are you?

677
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:33,039
Daddy! Come help us, please!

678
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,167
No, not her!

679
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,085
No!

680
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:07,322
Dad!

681
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,613
Dad, answer me!

682
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:15,625
Ouch.

683
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:19,130
You've gotta help me find my dad.
We need him to help us.

684
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:20,631
Hand me the padlock.

685
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,258
Aren't you listening to me?

686
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:25,135
Yes, and I said,
hand me the padlock!

687
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:29,474
- Here! You're gonna be sorry.
- I hope not.

688
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,361
Megan.

689
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,448
Megan, get back to the
cabin with the kids.

690
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:54,991
Megan, please!

691
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:58,544
- Wait a minute. You can't do this.
- Get back in there before it's too late.

692
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:09,221
Megan, no!

693
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,428
Megan!

694
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:15,015
Megan! Megan, no!

695
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,013
Jason!

696
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,272
Jason!

697
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:28,567
Jason, come on!

698
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:31,862
Come and get me! It's
me you want, remember?

699
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,799
That's it. Come on,
maggot-head. Come on!

700
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,711
Come on, maggot-head.
That's it, come on!

701
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:01,516
Tommy!

702
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,688
Get out of there!

703
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,728
Hurry!

704
01:16:06,187 --> 01:16:08,315
Hey, asshole!

705
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:11,200
It's me you want,
remember? Come on!

706
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:12,826
Come on, chickenshit.

707
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:16,535
Come on, I'm standing here
waiting. Come on, you pussy!

708
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,453
No!

709
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,341
Is he killed?

710
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,259
Stay here.

711
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:33,241
All right! Yeah!

712
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,002
It's over.

713
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:47,759
It's finally over.

714
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:50,842
Jason's home.

715
01:23:46,416 --> 01:23:48,792
<i>You're with your baby</i>

716
01:23:48,793 --> 01:23:52,922
<i>And you're parked alone
on a summer night</i>

717
01:23:52,923 --> 01:23:57,551
<i>You're deep in love but
you're deeper in the woods</i>

718
01:23:57,552 --> 01:24:00,380
<i>You think you're doing all right</i>

719
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:04,934
<i>Did you hear that voice?</i>

720
01:24:04,935 --> 01:24:09,146
<i>Did you see that face
or was it just a dream?</i>

721
01:24:09,147 --> 01:24:13,943
<i>This can't be real,
that only happens, babe,</i>

722
01:24:13,944 --> 01:24:16,229
<i>On the movie screen</i>

723
01:24:18,156 --> 01:24:20,532
<i>Oh, but he's back</i>

724
01:24:20,533 --> 01:24:24,578
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

725
01:24:24,579 --> 01:24:26,872
<i>And he's out of control</i>

726
01:24:26,873 --> 01:24:28,832
<i>He's back</i>

727
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:32,287
<i>The man behind the mask</i>

728
01:24:33,088 --> 01:24:38,626
<i>And he crawled out of his hole</i>

729
01:24:40,595 --> 01:24:44,932
<i>You're swimming with your
girl out on Lover's Lake</i>

730
01:24:44,933 --> 01:24:47,268
<i>And the wind blows cold</i>

731
01:24:47,269 --> 01:24:51,014
<i>It chills your bones but
you're still on the make</i>

732
01:24:51,898 --> 01:24:54,225
<i>That's a bad mistake</i>

733
01:24:56,236 --> 01:24:58,862
<i>Ah, but the moon was full</i>

734
01:24:58,863 --> 01:25:02,866
<i>And you had a chance
to be all alone</i>

735
01:25:02,867 --> 01:25:04,910
<i>But you're not alone</i>

736
01:25:04,911 --> 01:25:07,405
<i>This is your last dance</i>

737
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:10,992
<i>And your last romance</i>

738
01:25:12,294 --> 01:25:14,670
<i>Yeah, cos he's back</i>

739
01:25:14,671 --> 01:25:18,882
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

740
01:25:18,883 --> 01:25:21,135
<i>And he's out of control</i>

741
01:25:21,136 --> 01:25:22,970
<i>He's back</i>

742
01:25:22,971 --> 01:25:26,424
<i>The man behind the mask</i>

743
01:25:26,975 --> 01:25:32,555
<i>And he crawled out of his hole</i>

744
01:25:50,373 --> 01:25:53,042
<i>Oh, if you see him coming</i>

745
01:25:53,043 --> 01:25:55,419
<i>Get away if you can</i>

746
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:59,173
<i>Just keep on running,
run as fast as you can</i>

747
01:25:59,174 --> 01:26:04,671
<i>He's a dangerous, dangerous man</i>

748
01:26:05,096 --> 01:26:07,181
<i>And he's out tonight</i>

749
01:26:07,182 --> 01:26:09,099
<i>And he's watching you</i>

750
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:11,427
<i>And he knows your house</i>

751
01:26:13,939 --> 01:26:16,599
<i>No, don't turn out the lights</i>

752
01:26:18,443 --> 01:26:20,986
<i>Yeah, cos he's back</i>

753
01:26:20,987 --> 01:26:24,823
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

754
01:26:24,824 --> 01:26:27,159
<i>And he's out of control</i>

755
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,161
<i>He's back</i>

756
01:26:29,162 --> 01:26:32,873
<i>The man behind the mask</i>

757
01:26:32,874 --> 01:26:35,209
<i>And he's after your soul</i>

758
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:36,961
<i>He's back</i>

759
01:26:36,962 --> 01:26:40,881
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

760
01:26:40,882 --> 01:26:43,300
<i>And he's out of control</i>

761
01:26:43,301 --> 01:26:45,219
<i>He's back</i>

762
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:49,014
<i>The man behind the mask</i>

763
01:26:49,015 --> 01:26:51,267
<i>And he's after your soul</i>

764
01:26:51,268 --> 01:26:52,768
<i>He's back</i>

765
01:26:52,769 --> 01:26:56,897
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

766
