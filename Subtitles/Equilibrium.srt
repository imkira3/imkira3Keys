1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,100
In the first years
of the 21st century...

2
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,599
...a third World War broke out.

3
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:51,099
Those of us who survived knew

4
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:57,598
mankind could never survive...

5
00:00:57,597 --> 00:01:00,197
a fourth...

6
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:03,898
that our own volatile natures

7
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:08,197
could simply no longer
be risked.

8
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:13,296
So we have created
a new arm of the law...

9
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:18,296
...the Grammaton Cleric,

10
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:23,295
whose sole task it is
to seek out and eradicate

11
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:28,694
the true source
of man's inhumanity to man.

12
00:01:31,294 --> 00:01:35,094
His ability...

13
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:37,093
to feel.

14
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:39,393
Police!

15
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,391
You know what to do.

16
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,689
Get down!

17
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:01,383
We have an unknown number

18
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:03,883
barricaded in the southeast end
of the compound.

19
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,383
Read that.
Tetragrammaton team en route.

20
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:10,482
Cleric, lights out.
Maybe more than a dozen inside.

21
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:12,981
When the door's down,
blow the bulbs.

22
00:03:12,982 --> 00:03:14,782
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:19,981
Go.

24
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:09,375
Where is he?

25
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:10,575
Shut up.

26
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:13,674
Anybody get him?
Did anybody hit him?

27
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:15,175
Shut up!

28
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:16,674
Listen.

29
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,260
This is it.

30
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,559
Where?

31
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,060
There.

32
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,655
It's real.

33
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:10,354
Burn it.

34
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:51,949
Why didn't you just leave it

35
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:55,148
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

36
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:01,948
They miss things sometimes.

37
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:07,048
And I thought
I'd take it down myself...

38
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:08,647
get it done properly.

39
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:17,346
How long, Preston,
till all this is gone?

40
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:21,745
Till we've burned
every last bit of it?

41
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:25,144
Resources are tight.

42
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:29,245
We'll get it all eventually.

43
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:37,044
Libria...

44
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:40,443
I congratulate you.

45
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:42,443
At last...

46
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:47,243
peace reigns
in the heart of man.

47
00:08:47,342 --> 00:08:50,142
At last, war is but a word

48
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:53,441
whose meaning fades
from our understanding.

49
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,741
At last...

50
00:08:55,841 --> 00:09:00,041
we... are... whole.

51
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,340
Librians... there is a disease
in the heart of man.

52
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,939
Its symptom is hate.

53
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:21,438
Its symptom... is anger.

54
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:25,538
Its symptom is rage.

55
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:30,537
Its symptom... is war.

56
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:37,636
The disease... is human emotion.

57
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:41,836
But, Libria...
I congratulate you.

58
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:44,336
For there is a cure
for this disease.

59
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:47,835
At the cost of the dizzying
highs of human emotion,

60
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:52,035
we have suppressed
its abysmal lows.

61
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:57,634
And you as a society
have embraced this cure.

62
00:09:59,033 --> 00:09:59,933
Prozium.

63
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,733
Now we are at peace
with ourselves,

64
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:08,233
and humankind is one.

65
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:10,232
War is gone.

66
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:12,932
Hate, a memory.

67
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:15,932
We are our own conscience now.

68
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:21,432
And it is this conscience
that guides us to rate EC-10

69
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:23,731
for emotional content

70
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,030
all those things that might
tempt us to feel again...

71
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,730
and destroy them.

72
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,730
Librians, you have won.

73
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,730
Against all odds
and your own natures...

74
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:42,129
you have survived.

75
00:11:02,826 --> 00:11:05,326
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

76
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:08,925
it reminds why we do
what we do.

77
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:10,125
It does?

78
00:11:12,225 --> 00:11:14,025
I beg your pardon.

79
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:20,324
<i>It does.</i>

80
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:36,622
The following items
have been rated EC-10...

81
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:38,122
condemned...

82
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:41,022
seven works of two-dimensional
illustrated material,

83
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:43,721
seven discs of musical content,

84
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:46,821
20 interactive strategy
computer programs.

85
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
Seven works
of two-dimensional...

86
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,220
Thank you
for coming, Cleric.

87
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:59,219
I assume you know who I am.

88
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,519
Yes, sir. Of course.

89
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,219
You are Vice-Council Dupont

90
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:04,519
of the Third Conciliarly
of the Tetragrammaton...

91
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:06,018
Father's voice.

92
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:07,819
Quite frankly, Cleric,

93
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:12,618
I am told that you are
very nearly a prodigal student,

94
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:16,518
knowing almost instantly
if someone is feeling.

95
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:18,417
I have a good record, sir.

96
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:21,217
Why, do you imagine,
that is, Cleric?

97
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:23,716
I'm not sure, Vice-Council.

98
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:27,917
Somehow...

99
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:30,516
I'm able, on some level,

100
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:34,115
to sense
how an offender thinks,

101
00:12:34,215 --> 00:12:38,115
to... put myself
in their position.

102
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:43,415
If you had ceased
your interval,

103
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:46,914
if you were
a sense offender...

104
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:49,114
I suppose
you could say that, sir.

105
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:51,513
You're a family man, Cleric?

106
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:53,213
Yes, sir...
a boy and a girl.

107
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:55,312
The boy's in
the monastery himself,

108
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:56,813
on path to becoming a Cleric.

109
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:57,912
Good.

110
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:59,212
And the mother?

111
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,112
My spouse was arrested
and incinerated

112
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:02,912
for sense offense
four years ago, sir.

113
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:04,012
By yourself?

114
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:05,211
No, sir... by another.

115
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:09,511
How did you feel about that?

116
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,610
I'm sorry.

117
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,811
I don't...
fully understand, sir.

118
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,810
How did you feel?

119
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,410
I didn't feel anything.

120
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,309
Really?

121
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:27,709
How is it
that you came to miss it?

122
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:34,708
I...

123
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,108
I've asked myself
that same question, sir.

124
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:41,707
I don't know.

125
00:13:43,307 --> 00:13:46,607
A nearly unforgivable lapse,
Cleric.

126
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:53,007
I trust you'll be
more vigilant in the future.

127
00:13:54,705 --> 00:13:56,405
Yes, sir.

128
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:03,405
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

129
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:06,205
it reminds why we do
what we do.

130
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,304
It does?

131
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:11,004
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

132
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:14,404
it reminds why we do
what we do.

133
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:15,403
It does?

134
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:19,502
<i>It does.</i>

135
00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:26,703
Prosecutorial evidence
for A.N.R. 136890.

136
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,401
I need it.

137
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:30,402
It was late this afternoon.

138
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,701
May not have showed up
in the records yet.

139
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,400
I'm very sorry, Cleric.

140
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,901
Nothing has been logged

141
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,401
and nothing is pending
under that entry.

142
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,600
It was an item of evidence
brought in personally

143
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,900
by Grammaton Errol Partridge.

144
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
Check again.

145
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,600
Sir, Cleric Partridge has not
entered anything in for weeks.

146
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:51,699
You're mistaken.
It was a book of some kind.

147
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:52,798
Cleric...

148
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:56,598
...there's nothing.

149
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,798
Thank you.

150
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:06,098
He's been passing through
the gate into the Nether

151
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:07,598
every night
for the last two weeks.

152
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:09,197
We assumed it was
enforcement-related.

153
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:55,092
You always knew.

154
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,590
"But I, being poor...

155
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,990
have only my dreams."

156
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,390
"I have spread my dreams
under your feet.

157
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:17,689
"Tread softly...

158
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:21,089
because you tread
on my dreams."

159
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:25,288
I assume you dream, Preston.

160
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:29,388
I'll do what I can
to see they go easy on you.

161
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:36,387
We both know...
they never go easy.

162
00:16:36,387 --> 00:16:37,587
Then I'm sorry.

163
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:39,687
No, you're not.

164
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:42,887
You don't even know
the meaning.

165
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:45,586
It's just a... vestigial word

166
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:47,485
for a feeling
you've never felt.

167
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:52,285
Don't you see, Preston?

168
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:54,484
It's gone.

169
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:57,784
Everything that makes us
what we are... traded away.

170
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,984
There's no war.

171
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:02,784
No murder.

172
00:17:04,283 --> 00:17:06,083
What is it you think we do?

173
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,983
No.

174
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:09,282
You've been with me.

175
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:12,783
You've seen how it can be...
the jealousy, the rage.

176
00:17:14,882 --> 00:17:16,882
A heavy cost.

177
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:21,481
I'd pay it gladly.

178
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:46,378
Don't.

179
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,074
You and your partner
were close?

180
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:40,173
I hope you're as pleased
to be assigned me

181
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:42,172
as I am the placement.

182
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:47,071
I was told this would be
a career-making advancement.

183
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,070
I'm like you, Cleric...
intuitive.

184
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,470
Sometimes I know
when a person's feeling

185
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,370
before they know it
themselves.

186
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:12,868
Cleric...

187
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:16,668
I can only hope one day
to be as...

188
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:20,767
uncompromising as you.

189
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:22,167
Good night.

190
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,967
The later 20th century

191
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:30,167
saw the fortuitous
and simultaneous rise

192
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:35,366
of two synergistic political
and psychological sciences.

193
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:39,466
The first, the revolutionary
precept of the hate crime.

194
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:43,164
John?

195
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:44,264
Yes?

196
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:47,464
I saw Robbie Taylor
crying today.

197
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:51,264
He didn't know, but I saw.

198
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:53,663
Do you think
I should report him?

199
00:19:59,462 --> 00:20:01,262
Unquestionably.

200
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:10,162
...a single inescapable fact...

201
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:13,261
that mankind united with
infinitely greater purpose

202
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:15,961
in pursuit of war...

203
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,960
than he ever did
in pursuit of peace.

204
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,259
"But I, being poor...

205
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,059
have only my dreams."

206
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:37,458
I have spread my dreams
under your feet."

207
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:41,358
"Tread softly...

208
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:44,258
because you tread
on my dreams."

209
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,253
Don't move! Don't move!

210
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:30,952
Comply! Comply!

211
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:32,951
- Stop! Stop where you are!
- Get down! Get down!

212
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:39,651
Don't shoot.
This is a lawful entry.

213
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:41,251
We have a warrant
for your wife's arrest.

214
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,150
She's charged
with sense offense.

215
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,349
Hey!

216
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,249
Get her!
Get her off him now!

217
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:02,748
Remember me.

218
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,347
Libria...

219
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:20,146
Awake.

220
00:22:20,246 --> 00:22:25,446
Awaken to triumph again
in the face of yet another day,

221
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:29,045
another step
in our unified march

222
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:32,745
into the unwavering purpose...

223
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:39,444
...move ahead together

224
00:22:39,543 --> 00:22:43,143
into the certainty
of our collective destiny.

225
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:05,541
What are you doing?

226
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,140
I said, what are you doing?

227
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,640
I accidentally dropped my...

228
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:16,239
morning interval.

229
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:19,339
I took it out
before I brushed my teeth.

230
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:22,939
I never take it out
before I brush my teeth.

231
00:23:22,939 --> 00:23:26,839
Then you'll go by Equilibrium,
log the loss,

232
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,238
and get a replacement.

233
00:23:29,838 --> 00:23:31,238
Yes.

234
00:23:31,337 --> 00:23:33,137
Of course.

235
00:23:53,835 --> 00:23:56,035
Your new partner called.

236
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,535
He says he'll pick you up
at 10:00 for the A.N.R.

237
00:23:58,534 --> 00:23:59,934
I hope you don't mind.

238
00:23:59,934 --> 00:24:02,334
I took the liberty
of telling him

239
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:05,434
you would be at Equilibrium,
replacing your dose.

240
00:24:06,534 --> 00:24:08,034
No, of course not.

241
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:10,133
That was the right thing
to do.

242
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:15,432
Stop that.

243
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:25,331
Due to terrorist activity,

244
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,831
this site is
temporarily closed.

245
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:33,331
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.

246
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,830
Due to terrorist activity,

247
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:39,129
this site is
temporarily closed.

248
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,729
This site is
temporarily closed.

249
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:46,229
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.

250
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:53,028
More than punctual, Cleric.

251
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:54,228
Hop in.

252
00:25:07,226 --> 00:25:08,926
How were the lines?

253
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:11,425
I'm surprised you were able
to get your interval

254
00:25:11,526 --> 00:25:13,226
and get out so quickly.

255
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:16,525
No, they're...
they're fine today.

256
00:25:20,524 --> 00:25:23,724
Maybe I'll drop by later,
get my interval adjusted.

257
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:27,524
You expecting Resistance?

258
00:25:27,524 --> 00:25:30,724
That's something you'll find
about me, Cleric.

259
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:34,823
I'm a wary person,
cautious by nature.

260
00:25:36,222 --> 00:25:38,522
Always expecting the worst.

261
00:25:40,922 --> 00:25:42,222
You can't do this.
You cannot do this.

262
00:25:42,322 --> 00:25:45,422
Tetragrammaton.
There's nothing we can't do.

263
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:48,621
How long have you been off
the dose?

264
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:49,721
Look at you.

265
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:52,521
Look at you!

266
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,720
Look at you.

267
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,520
The mirror's frame is illegal.
Destroy it.

268
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:17,219
We have suppression.
We're making entry.

269
00:26:17,318 --> 00:26:18,718
Standard deployment.

270
00:26:18,817 --> 00:26:21,617
Collecting catalog.
Illegal articles.

271
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:09,412
You're gonna burn it,
aren't you?

272
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:12,111
Eventually.

273
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:14,911
However, you couldn't have
accumulated all this

274
00:27:15,011 --> 00:27:16,211
by yourself.

275
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:19,311
It'll all be sorted
and examined.

276
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:22,511
We'll discover
who your confederates are.

277
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,210
Gun!

278
00:27:42,907 --> 00:27:44,607
We need her.

279
00:28:10,804 --> 00:28:11,804
What's your name?

280
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:15,104
O'Brien, Mary.

281
00:28:15,104 --> 00:28:18,404
Well, Mary...

282
00:28:18,403 --> 00:28:19,803
you can either wait

283
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:24,004
and tell the technicians
at the Palace of Justice...

284
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:26,803
or you can tell me now.

285
00:28:26,903 --> 00:28:28,903
Who are your friends?

286
00:28:32,602 --> 00:28:35,102
I'm wondering if you have
any idea at all

287
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:38,202
what that word means...
"friend."

288
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:43,801
There's nothing
you don't feel?

289
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,000
How about guilt?

290
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,000
Let me ask you something.

291
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:02,498
Why are you alive?

292
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:08,298
I'm alive...

293
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:13,997
I live...

294
00:29:16,496 --> 00:29:19,896
...to safeguard the continuity
of this great society.

295
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:21,596
To serve Libria.

296
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:23,096
It's circular.

297
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:25,796
You exist to continue
your existence.

298
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:27,295
What's the point?

299
00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:31,295
<i>What's the point
of your existence?</i>

300
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:32,895
To feel.

301
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:36,094
'Cause you've never done it,
you can never know it.

302
00:29:36,194 --> 00:29:38,894
But it's as vital as breath.

303
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:41,594
And without it...
without love,

304
00:29:41,694 --> 00:29:45,194
without anger,
without sorrow...

305
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:49,694
breath is
just a clock ticking.

306
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,692
Then I have no choice
but to remand you

307
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,992
to the Palace of Justice
for processing.

308
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:02,392
Processing.

309
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:07,691
You mean execution, don't you?

310
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:11,791
Processing.

311
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:21,689
The Gun Katas.

312
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:24,689
Through analysis of thousands
of recorded gunfights,

313
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,689
the Cleric has determined

314
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:29,889
that the geometric distribution
of antagonists in any gun battle

315
00:30:29,988 --> 00:30:32,688
is a statistically
predictable element.

316
00:30:32,688 --> 00:30:36,188
The Gun Kata treats
the gun as a total weapon,

317
00:30:36,188 --> 00:30:38,488
each fluid position
representing

318
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,587
a maximum kill zone,
inflicting maximum damage

319
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:43,486
on the maximum number
of opponents

320
00:30:43,586 --> 00:30:45,286
while keeping
the defender clear

321
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,686
of the statistically
traditional trajectories

322
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:49,385
of return fire.

323
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:52,486
By the rote mastery
of this art,

324
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:55,786
your firing efficiency will rise
by no less than 120%.

325
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:59,485
The difference of a 63% increase
to lethal proficiency

326
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,884
makes the master
of the Gun Katas

327
00:31:01,984 --> 00:31:05,884
an adversary not to be
taken lightly.

328
00:31:56,278 --> 00:31:58,978
Without love...

329
00:31:59,078 --> 00:32:02,678
breath is just a clock...
ticking.

330
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:47,965
Prozium...
the great nepenthe.

331
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:50,165
Opiate of our masses.

332
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:52,864
Glue of our great society.

333
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,064
Salve and salvation,

334
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:59,064
it has delivered us
from pathos, from sorrow,

335
00:33:59,063 --> 00:34:03,163
the deepest chasms
of melancholy and hate.

336
00:34:03,262 --> 00:34:05,762
With it, we anesthetize grief,

337
00:34:05,863 --> 00:34:09,963
annihilate jealousy,
obliterate rage.

338
00:34:10,062 --> 00:34:14,462
That those sister impulses
towards joy, love, and elation

339
00:34:14,561 --> 00:34:17,061
are anesthetized in stride,

340
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:19,461
we accept as fair sacrifice.

341
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:25,461
For we embrace Prozium
in its unifying fullness

342
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,760
and all that it has done
to make us great.

343
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,254
Good morning, Cleric.

344
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:26,253
Good morning.

345
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:30,353
...intrinsically, humans,
as creatures of the Earth

346
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:36,652
were drawn inherently always
back to one thing... war.

347
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:40,051
And thus we seek to correct
not the symptom

348
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:42,651
but the disease itself.

349
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:46,151
We have sought to shrug off
individuality,

350
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,850
replacing it with conformity.

351
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:51,851
Replacing it...

352
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,650
with sameness...

353
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,250
with unity,

354
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:01,850
allowing each man, woman,
and child

355
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:03,749
in this great society

356
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:07,448
to lead identical lives.

357
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:12,448
The concept of identical
environment construction

358
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:15,748
allows each of us to head
confidently into each moment

359
00:36:15,847 --> 00:36:17,547
with all the secure knowledge

360
00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:20,447
it has been lived before.

361
00:36:35,345 --> 00:36:36,945
What are you doing?

362
00:36:40,744 --> 00:36:42,744
I'm rearranging my desk.

363
00:36:42,844 --> 00:36:45,444
You didn't like
the way it was before?

364
00:36:47,144 --> 00:36:48,644
I had no feelings about it.

365
00:36:48,743 --> 00:36:50,943
I'm merely attempting
to optimize.

366
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:57,843
Sense offenders
holed up in the Nether.

367
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:14,941
We estimate...
we estimate 50 men, sir.

368
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,640
Intelligence tells us
they're all fully armed.

369
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,339
This is the group that bombed
the Prozium factories.

370
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,940
You clean, we'll sweep.

371
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:25,539
Yes, sir.

372
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:30,439
Go! Go! Go! Go!

373
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:31,438
Go!

374
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:33,038
Aah!

375
00:37:33,138 --> 00:37:35,538
Take it! Take the landings!

376
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:37,738
- Aah!
- Aah!

377
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:51,336
- Cover me. I'm going in.
- Aaaaaaaah!

378
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:56,735
Nice grab, Cleric.

379
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:30,417
"Ludwig Van Beethoven."

380
00:42:29,103 --> 00:42:30,203
Cleric...

381
00:42:31,302 --> 00:42:32,702
Why didn't you leave that

382
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:35,603
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

383
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:43,201
They miss things sometimes.

384
00:42:43,201 --> 00:42:46,401
I'll take it in myself...

385
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:49,201
make sure
it gets done properly.

386
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,300
You know, Preston...

387
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,200
If we keep burning
all this contraband,

388
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:00,499
eventually there won't be
anything left to burn.

389
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:04,399
What'll there be
for men like us?

390
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,198
Sir!

391
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:07,799
We got something out back.

392
00:43:17,397 --> 00:43:19,697
We're gonna need
two more men on this.

393
00:43:25,197 --> 00:43:27,497
These animals were defended
by women and children.

394
00:43:27,596 --> 00:43:28,896
We put them down easily.

395
00:43:28,896 --> 00:43:32,596
This isn't the first time
we've seen this.

396
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:34,895
Why do they keep
these animals?

397
00:43:34,995 --> 00:43:37,095
What, do they...
do they eat them?

398
00:43:39,095 --> 00:43:41,195
What do you want me
to do, sir?

399
00:43:41,294 --> 00:43:42,594
Exterminate them, of course.

400
00:43:42,695 --> 00:43:44,095
All right. Let's do it.

401
00:43:44,194 --> 00:43:45,994
No.

402
00:43:45,994 --> 00:43:47,194
What's wrong, Cleric?

403
00:43:50,793 --> 00:43:52,993
Nothing.

404
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:07,491
Hey...

405
00:44:07,592 --> 00:44:08,792
Grab it.

406
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:09,991
Grab it!

407
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,890
Sir... toss it back in.

408
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,790
I'll finish it off.

409
00:44:26,689 --> 00:44:27,789
Give it to me, sir.

410
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:29,789
Give it to him, Cleric.
He'll finish it.

411
00:44:43,787 --> 00:44:44,987
Wait!

412
00:44:47,987 --> 00:44:50,587
It seems to me that...

413
00:44:50,686 --> 00:44:54,286
at least some of these animals
ought to be tested for disease.

414
00:44:54,386 --> 00:44:56,386
If there's an epidemic
in the Nether,

415
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:58,986
it's best we know about it.

416
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:05,685
I don't quite follow
your logic, Cleric.

417
00:45:05,785 --> 00:45:07,085
They were Resistance.

418
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:09,384
They could have led us
to the Underground.

419
00:45:09,384 --> 00:45:11,084
But instead of apprehension
and interrogation,

420
00:45:11,184 --> 00:45:12,084
they were slaughtered.

421
00:45:12,184 --> 00:45:15,384
Yes, but, Cleric,
given the circumstances,

422
00:45:15,483 --> 00:45:16,983
the Father has decreed

423
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:20,483
that there will be no more
"process" for sense offenders.

424
00:45:20,582 --> 00:45:22,982
They are either to be
shot on sight

425
00:45:23,082 --> 00:45:24,482
or incinerated without a trial.

426
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:25,783
But it's counter to law.

427
00:45:25,782 --> 00:45:27,682
You're a member
of the Council. If...

428
00:45:27,682 --> 00:45:29,582
It is not the will
of the Council,

429
00:45:29,682 --> 00:45:32,382
it is the will of Father...
and he is law.

430
00:45:34,082 --> 00:45:36,582
Sir...

431
00:45:36,581 --> 00:45:39,581
without the logic of process,
is it not just mayhem...

432
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,580
what we have worked so hard
to eradicate?

433
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,780
You must understand, Preston,

434
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,480
that while you... and even I...
may not always agree with it,

435
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,280
it is not the message
that is important,

436
00:45:51,379 --> 00:45:54,579
it is our obedience to it.

437
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:56,779
Father's will.

438
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,479
Call it faith.

439
00:45:59,478 --> 00:46:01,578
You have it, I assume?

440
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:07,478
Yes.

441
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,577
I have it.

442
00:46:10,576 --> 00:46:12,176
Good.

443
00:46:33,574 --> 00:46:36,874
Confiscated evidence
X23-T45...

444
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:39,274
Mary O'Brien.

445
00:47:41,466 --> 00:47:43,566
Cleric John Preston
passing into the Nether...

446
00:47:43,566 --> 00:47:45,766
enforcement-related.

447
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:49,965
Thank you, sir.

448
00:48:21,961 --> 00:48:24,561
I don't know what else
to do with you.

449
00:48:27,461 --> 00:48:28,661
Go on.

450
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,760
Go on.

451
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,160
Go!

452
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:10,756
Fine.

453
00:49:10,856 --> 00:49:12,856
But you're going back
in the trunk.

454
00:49:26,754 --> 00:49:28,254
Okay.

455
00:49:31,553 --> 00:49:32,853
Here.

456
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:46,152
Step away from the vehicle!

457
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:48,451
Step away from the vehicle!

458
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:49,751
This is your last warning!

459
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:52,651
Step away from the vehicle!

460
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:54,951
Identification.

461
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:56,450
I'm a Cleric.

462
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:58,750
I'm here on official business.

463
00:49:58,750 --> 00:49:59,550
Identification!

464
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:01,950
It's in my coat.

465
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,250
Where's the coat?
Where is it?!

466
00:50:05,549 --> 00:50:07,549
I don't have it.

467
00:50:07,649 --> 00:50:10,349
Unidentified individuals are
subject to summary destruction.

468
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:12,149
You're making
a very big mistake.

469
00:50:12,148 --> 00:50:13,248
I'm a Grammaton Cleric,
first class.

470
00:50:13,348 --> 00:50:14,348
We're gonna search
your vehicle.

471
00:50:14,448 --> 00:50:16,648
No, you're not.
There's nothing in it.

472
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,247
Search it!

473
00:50:25,046 --> 00:50:27,046
- Clear, sir.
- Keys to the trunk.

474
00:50:27,047 --> 00:50:28,347
I'm trying to tell you.

475
00:50:28,446 --> 00:50:30,446
I have a predawn combustion
to witness.

476
00:50:30,546 --> 00:50:31,946
I'm not...

477
00:50:32,046 --> 00:50:34,046
Captain, this is a waste
of my time.

478
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:35,446
My name is John Preston.

479
00:50:35,445 --> 00:50:37,845
I'm the highest-ranking Cleric
of the Tetragramm...

480
00:50:37,845 --> 00:50:39,445
Wait.

481
00:50:43,044 --> 00:50:44,144
Stand off.

482
00:50:46,944 --> 00:50:49,344
I'm sorry
I didn't recognize you, sir.

483
00:50:51,644 --> 00:50:53,944
That's okay.
Just doing your job.

484
00:50:53,944 --> 00:50:54,944
Thank you.

485
00:50:56,243 --> 00:50:57,943
We'll escort you back
to the gate.

486
00:50:57,943 --> 00:50:58,943
Thanks.

487
00:51:06,142 --> 00:51:07,342
Animals.

488
00:51:08,741 --> 00:51:10,241
Nether's full of them.

489
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:12,241
Sounds like it came
from your trunk.

490
00:51:12,241 --> 00:51:14,241
Impossible.

491
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:16,241
Just give me my keys.

492
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,440
I'll be on my way.

493
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,340
Captain...

494
00:51:24,439 --> 00:51:27,539
I'm asking you
one last time...

495
00:51:27,639 --> 00:51:29,439
don't do this.

496
00:51:30,939 --> 00:51:32,239
Down on your knees!

497
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,939
- Down on your knees!
- Down on your knees!

498
00:51:33,938 --> 00:51:35,138
Drop down!

499
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:37,539
On the ground! Comply!

500
00:51:37,538 --> 00:51:39,138
Do it!

501
00:51:39,937 --> 00:51:41,037
No.

502
00:51:41,037 --> 00:51:42,437
Fuck!

503
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,137
What?

504
00:51:48,236 --> 00:51:50,536
Aw, shit! Shoot him!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

505
00:51:59,835 --> 00:52:01,035
Aah!

506
00:54:19,419 --> 00:54:21,919
Always practicing, Cleric.

507
00:54:22,018 --> 00:54:24,618
I guess that's why
you're the best.

508
00:54:27,718 --> 00:54:29,318
Maybe I'm just better.

509
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:32,217
Something on your mind?

510
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:36,217
Why do you ask?

511
00:54:36,317 --> 00:54:37,517
The intuitive arts, Cleric.

512
00:54:37,616 --> 00:54:39,716
It's my job to know
what you're thinking.

513
00:54:51,115 --> 00:54:53,815
So, then...
what am I thinking?

514
00:54:58,714 --> 00:55:01,814
About the murders
in the Nether last night...

515
00:55:08,113 --> 00:55:09,913
And if they know who did it.

516
00:55:15,713 --> 00:55:16,713
Am I close?

517
00:55:19,612 --> 00:55:22,112
So, tell me... do they know?

518
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,610
There are theories.

519
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,010
I have one or two of my own,
but at the moment...

520
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,210
They're premature!

521
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:43,409
I'm glad it happened.

522
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:48,808
Why?

523
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:50,909
Because now
Father and the Council

524
00:55:51,008 --> 00:55:54,508
have decreed an acceleration
in the crackdown on offenders.

525
00:55:54,607 --> 00:55:56,807
Whoever did it...

526
00:55:56,907 --> 00:56:00,307
all they accomplished was
a quicker end to the Resistance.

527
00:56:09,706 --> 00:56:11,506
It's gonna be
a massacre, Cleric.

528
00:56:28,204 --> 00:56:31,404
I came to tell you...
there's a raid in the Nether...

529
00:56:31,504 --> 00:56:34,504
Sector 7.

530
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:38,202
So get ready.

531
00:57:19,498 --> 00:57:20,898
That door behind you...

532
00:57:22,997 --> 00:57:24,297
Go.

533
00:57:25,997 --> 00:57:27,297
Go, damn you!

534
00:57:31,797 --> 00:57:33,397
Get out of here, God damn it!
If you don't, you're dead!

535
00:57:33,496 --> 00:57:35,296
Don't do it.
He'll shoot us in the back.

536
00:57:35,396 --> 00:57:37,396
If I was gonna shoot you,
I'd shoot you in the face.

537
00:57:37,395 --> 00:57:38,795
Now go.

538
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:46,795
Damn you! Follow me.

539
00:57:46,894 --> 00:57:49,594
Now! Let's go!

540
00:57:58,593 --> 00:58:00,193
There will be no detention.

541
00:58:00,192 --> 00:58:03,992
Repeat...
no detention for any purpose.

542
00:58:04,093 --> 00:58:07,893
All prisoners and apprehendees
are to be put down.

543
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:17,591
Look out!

544
00:58:20,391 --> 00:58:22,091
Aah!

545
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,590
Aaaah!

546
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,390
Cleric, what's happening?
We heard gunshots.

547
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:34,989
Go!

548
00:58:35,089 --> 00:58:37,289
What are you doing?
Cleric!

549
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:38,589
They're Resistance fighters.

550
00:58:39,688 --> 00:58:40,588
Cleric!

551
00:58:43,488 --> 00:58:44,688
He's a sense offender!

552
00:59:28,782 --> 00:59:30,082
Cover all quadrants!

553
00:59:30,182 --> 00:59:31,482
Secure the perimeter!

554
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:44,181
What is this?

555
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,080
What are you doing?!

556
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:49,681
Nicely done, Cleric.

557
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,880
You drive them
into the trap...

558
00:59:53,879 --> 00:59:55,079
I close it.

559
01:00:01,279 --> 01:00:06,279
The very definition
of... teamwork.

560
01:00:06,278 --> 01:00:07,878
Don't you think?

561
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:13,477
Why don't you take the honors
of the execution, Cleric?

562
01:00:17,177 --> 01:00:20,377
These people should be taken
for clinical interrogation.

563
01:00:20,476 --> 01:00:21,576
Cleric...

564
01:00:21,676 --> 01:00:23,976
Father's rulings
are quite clear.

565
01:00:24,076 --> 01:00:26,776
Offenders are to be shot
on sight.

566
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:28,475
They have valuable information.

567
01:00:28,476 --> 01:00:29,576
Cleric...

568
01:00:29,576 --> 01:00:31,076
They can be put to
much better use.

569
01:00:31,175 --> 01:00:32,175
Cleric.

570
01:00:33,475 --> 01:00:37,275
If your weapon's low,
please, use mine.

571
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:27,169
No.

572
01:01:30,468 --> 01:01:32,968
I think, in the end...

573
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:35,168
<i>it'll be better
if you have it.</i>

574
01:01:57,365 --> 01:01:58,365
Captain.

575
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,365
Yes, sir. Firing positions.

576
01:02:04,664 --> 01:02:05,964
Ready...

577
01:02:14,762 --> 01:02:15,762
Aim...

578
01:02:22,462 --> 01:02:24,262
Fire!

579
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:32,761
Sir?

580
01:02:32,861 --> 01:02:34,761
Yes, Cleric?

581
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,560
You asked me to become
Father's instrument

582
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:40,360
against the Resistance.

583
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,360
I'm ready.

584
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,360
Today.

585
01:02:44,459 --> 01:02:46,259
I wish to show my faith.

586
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:50,159
I wish, with your permission,

587
01:02:50,258 --> 01:02:53,158
to locate the Underground
once and for all.

588
01:02:53,258 --> 01:02:54,658
To destroy it.

589
01:02:57,457 --> 01:02:59,057
To destroy it.

590
01:02:59,158 --> 01:03:01,258
Good. Do it.

591
01:03:10,657 --> 01:03:13,657
I'm so...

592
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:15,456
so very sorry.

593
01:03:27,154 --> 01:03:30,454
These are the possessions he had
on him at the time of death.

594
01:03:30,454 --> 01:03:31,854
The illegal ones
will be burned with him.

595
01:03:31,954 --> 01:03:33,254
Good.

596
01:04:14,849 --> 01:04:16,149
Errol Partridge.

597
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:22,448
The name supposed to mean
something to me?

598
01:04:22,548 --> 01:04:25,248
He was a Grammaton Cleric,
first class. You knew him.

599
01:04:25,348 --> 01:04:28,648
News bulletin...
I'm a sense offender.

600
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:30,847
I don't hang around much
with the Cleric.

601
01:04:37,546 --> 01:04:39,646
I want to know about him.

602
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,145
Well...

603
01:04:44,246 --> 01:04:47,346
I suggest you go ask him.

604
01:04:48,445 --> 01:04:51,445
But I understand
that he's dead...

605
01:04:51,445 --> 01:04:55,145
killed by your friends
at the Tetragrammaton.

606
01:04:55,144 --> 01:04:57,844
Not by my friends.

607
01:04:57,943 --> 01:04:59,643
<i>By me.</i>

608
01:05:08,442 --> 01:05:09,942
Aaah!

609
01:05:44,138 --> 01:05:45,638
You were lovers.

610
01:06:03,836 --> 01:06:06,336
The Underground is our foe,

611
01:06:06,436 --> 01:06:09,036
and greater
than even the threat

612
01:06:09,035 --> 01:06:12,935
of those who have forsaken
their Prozium for emotion

613
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:18,135
is the threat of those
selfsame individuals united.

614
01:06:18,134 --> 01:06:20,934
They are
the secret organization...

615
01:06:26,533 --> 01:06:29,433
And thus, it is in the writing
of the Father

616
01:06:29,532 --> 01:06:31,232
that we find our greatest...

617
01:06:33,132 --> 01:06:35,032
Good afternoon, sir.

618
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:37,932
What will it be for you?

619
01:06:38,032 --> 01:06:39,732
The latest copy
of the inserts?

620
01:06:39,831 --> 01:06:42,031
Revised edition
of the manifesto?

621
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:43,131
Errol Partridge.

622
01:06:43,131 --> 01:06:45,731
What do you know about him?

623
01:06:45,831 --> 01:06:47,131
I beg your pardon?

624
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:49,030
Everyone out. Now.

625
01:07:02,929 --> 01:07:04,829
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

626
01:07:04,928 --> 01:07:07,528
Errol Partridge...
what do you know about him?

627
01:07:07,629 --> 01:07:10,529
I'm sure this must be
some mis...

628
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:12,828
- You're an offender.
- I'm not.

629
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:15,728
No? Then why are you
so scared of me?

630
01:07:15,828 --> 01:07:18,928
Now, you will tell me everything
you know about Errol Partridge,

631
01:07:18,927 --> 01:07:20,927
or I will have a wagon
come to take you

632
01:07:20,927 --> 01:07:23,827
to the Hall of Destruction
for summary combustion.

633
01:07:23,826 --> 01:07:26,026
I-I really don't know...

634
01:07:26,026 --> 01:07:27,126
Speak!

635
01:07:27,226 --> 01:07:30,826
He... he'd come in here
with a fellow named Jurgen.

636
01:07:30,925 --> 01:07:32,125
Why?

637
01:07:32,225 --> 01:07:35,325
That's... that's all I know.
I swear.

638
01:07:35,425 --> 01:07:36,425
Jurgen!

639
01:07:57,122 --> 01:07:58,922
Interesting.

640
01:08:00,722 --> 01:08:02,122
- Ugh-ow!
- Ugh!

641
01:08:37,018 --> 01:08:40,018
We've been watching you,
Preston.

642
01:08:46,217 --> 01:08:47,517
You're Jurgen.

643
01:08:49,116 --> 01:08:51,916
You're feeling.

644
01:09:06,215 --> 01:09:08,315
Do you know why you came?

645
01:09:31,012 --> 01:09:33,612
Welcome to the Underground.

646
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:45,610
Polygraph.

647
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:49,710
It detects fluctuations
of human emotion.

648
01:09:49,709 --> 01:09:51,909
We have to be sure.

649
01:09:57,009 --> 01:09:58,509
Mary.

650
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:07,207
You're carrying
in your left pocket

651
01:10:07,307 --> 01:10:10,207
a red ribbon
sprayed with her scent.

652
01:10:12,507 --> 01:10:14,307
You breathe it in sometimes

653
01:10:14,406 --> 01:10:17,306
when you think
there's no one to see.

654
01:10:17,406 --> 01:10:21,306
But what you feel...

655
01:10:21,405 --> 01:10:23,905
what you feel
could only be satisfied

656
01:10:24,005 --> 01:10:26,605
by falling yourself into her.

657
01:10:32,304 --> 01:10:35,504
She's scheduled
for combustion...

658
01:10:35,604 --> 01:10:37,804
tomorrow.

659
01:10:43,603 --> 01:10:45,803
I know.

660
01:10:47,102 --> 01:10:49,502
You know, I was like you.

661
01:10:49,602 --> 01:10:53,502
But the first thing
you learn about emotion

662
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:56,001
is that it has its price...

663
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,901
a complete paradox.

664
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:01,901
But without restraint...

665
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,200
without control...

666
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,200
emotion is chaos.

667
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,300
But how is that diff...

668
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,900
The difference being is
that when we want to feel,

669
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,100
we can.

670
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:17,699
It's just that...

671
01:11:17,799 --> 01:11:21,699
some of us...

672
01:11:21,798 --> 01:11:23,998
some of us have to forgo
that luxury

673
01:11:24,098 --> 01:11:27,198
so that the rest can have it.

674
01:11:27,298 --> 01:11:29,298
Some very few of us

675
01:11:29,398 --> 01:11:33,398
have to force ourselves
not to feel.

676
01:11:35,096 --> 01:11:36,296
Like me.

677
01:11:38,196 --> 01:11:40,096
Like you.

678
01:11:45,196 --> 01:11:47,096
What can I do?

679
01:11:49,695 --> 01:11:51,795
You can kill Father.

680
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:29,090
Cleric John Preston...

681
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:31,890
You are to come with us
immediately.

682
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:43,189
Cleric Preston.

683
01:12:43,289 --> 01:12:44,489
Sir.

684
01:12:47,288 --> 01:12:50,488
I've heard
the most disturbing rumor.

685
01:12:50,588 --> 01:12:51,888
Rumor, sir?

686
01:12:51,887 --> 01:12:52,887
Yes.

687
01:12:52,987 --> 01:12:55,287
A rumor maintaining
that one of us,

688
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:56,687
one of the Cleric,

689
01:12:56,787 --> 01:13:00,887
has secretly taken it upon
himself to cease his dose,

690
01:13:00,987 --> 01:13:03,787
that one of our elite number

691
01:13:03,886 --> 01:13:07,086
is actually feeling.

692
01:13:07,186 --> 01:13:09,086
Feeling, sir?

693
01:13:10,086 --> 01:13:12,786
Are you playing with me,
Cleric?!

694
01:13:18,184 --> 01:13:19,384
No, sir.

695
01:13:24,684 --> 01:13:28,184
This person, I'm told,

696
01:13:28,283 --> 01:13:31,983
is actually attempting
to contact the Resistance.

697
01:13:33,983 --> 01:13:37,483
Now tell me,
if you'll be so kind,

698
01:13:37,582 --> 01:13:39,482
how exactly...

699
01:13:39,482 --> 01:13:42,682
have you been making use
of your time of late?

700
01:13:48,581 --> 01:13:51,781
Attempting to contact
the Resistance, sir.

701
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:58,380
Attempting?

702
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:04,180
How is it that you intend
to expose this traitor

703
01:14:04,279 --> 01:14:07,279
if all you do is attempt?

704
01:14:12,678 --> 01:14:14,378
You're...

705
01:14:14,478 --> 01:14:16,278
absolutely...

706
01:14:16,378 --> 01:14:18,578
100% right, sir.

707
01:14:19,877 --> 01:14:22,077
Of course I am.

708
01:14:24,476 --> 01:14:27,976
The Cleric is the final line
of defense.

709
01:14:27,976 --> 01:14:30,276
If the Resistance
compromises it,

710
01:14:30,376 --> 01:14:32,776
we are doomed.

711
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:36,675
Father is doomed.

712
01:14:36,676 --> 01:14:39,376
I will redouble
my efforts, sir,

713
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:41,175
to locate the Resistance,

714
01:14:41,275 --> 01:14:42,775
to find this traitor,

715
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:46,175
and bring them all to
the Council's fair justice.

716
01:14:50,473 --> 01:14:51,573
Do it.

717
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:37,168
What are you doing?

718
01:15:40,568 --> 01:15:42,168
What are you doing?

719
01:15:45,067 --> 01:15:46,567
I, uh...

720
01:15:51,566 --> 01:15:54,466
I was checking
to make sure you've been...

721
01:15:54,566 --> 01:15:56,266
taking your interval.

722
01:15:57,366 --> 01:15:59,066
And are you satisfied?

723
01:16:02,565 --> 01:16:03,765
Yes, I am.

724
01:16:07,065 --> 01:16:08,465
Good night, Dad.

725
01:16:10,564 --> 01:16:12,264
I don't understand.

726
01:16:12,363 --> 01:16:14,963
My execution's set.

727
01:16:15,064 --> 01:16:17,464
Why are you here?

728
01:16:36,661 --> 01:16:38,161
Aren't you gonna dose?

729
01:16:51,959 --> 01:16:53,959
My God.

730
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:56,958
What...

731
01:17:00,059 --> 01:17:02,159
What'll you do?

732
01:17:03,758 --> 01:17:05,458
I don't know.

733
01:17:40,053 --> 01:17:41,353
50 sweepers, maybe more.

734
01:17:41,454 --> 01:17:43,854
What about an audience? Can you
arrange to meet with him?

735
01:17:43,953 --> 01:17:45,953
Father's never given a single
audience since the upheaval.

736
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:47,552
The danger of assassination
is too great.

737
01:17:47,653 --> 01:17:49,853
They trained you your whole life
to fight these kind of odds.

738
01:17:49,953 --> 01:17:51,553
Even if I could...

739
01:17:51,652 --> 01:17:53,452
even if I could
make it through,

740
01:17:53,452 --> 01:17:56,652
what guarantee is there
it would accomplish anything,

741
01:17:56,651 --> 01:17:58,251
that anything would be
different?

742
01:17:58,351 --> 01:18:01,151
We have a network that's larger
than you could ever imagine.

743
01:18:01,151 --> 01:18:03,051
Instant word comes
that Father is dead,

744
01:18:03,151 --> 01:18:04,651
that the Council is leaderless.

745
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:06,850
Bombs that have already
been planted will be set off

746
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:09,150
at Prozium clinics and factories
around Libria.

747
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,550
If we can succeed
in disrupting the supply

748
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:14,350
for even one day... one day...

749
01:18:14,349 --> 01:18:16,949
our cause will be won
by human nature itself.

750
01:18:17,049 --> 01:18:20,049
What about war, the everyday
cruelties that are all gone now?

751
01:18:20,148 --> 01:18:22,148
Replaced by the touch
of Grammaton.

752
01:18:25,948 --> 01:18:28,048
Will you do it?

753
01:18:35,947 --> 01:18:37,947
Yes.

754
01:18:39,747 --> 01:18:40,847
Can you?

755
01:18:44,646 --> 01:18:46,346
I don't know.

756
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:58,145
Don't...

757
01:19:00,044 --> 01:19:01,444
Seeing her one last time

758
01:19:01,544 --> 01:19:04,644
will only make it harder
to do what you have to do.

759
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:41,839
...designed especially
to deal with it.

760
01:19:41,939 --> 01:19:43,439
The Cleric was implemented

761
01:19:43,539 --> 01:19:45,939
and sent out to search
and destroy

762
01:19:45,939 --> 01:19:47,439
such objects that remained

763
01:19:47,538 --> 01:19:50,438
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

764
01:19:50,538 --> 01:19:51,938
File footage.

765
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:55,638
The Council...

766
01:19:55,737 --> 01:19:58,237
Viviana Preston.

767
01:19:58,337 --> 01:20:00,337
Sentence and incineration.

768
01:20:03,036 --> 01:20:04,136
Auditory.

769
01:20:04,136 --> 01:20:05,536
Viviana Preston,

770
01:20:05,636 --> 01:20:08,036
for ceasing your interval,
for the crime of feeling,

771
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:09,236
you stand condemned

772
01:20:09,235 --> 01:20:11,535
to suffer annihilation
in the city furnaces.

773
01:20:11,535 --> 01:20:15,035
You will be taken there
immediately, and you will burn.

774
01:20:31,433 --> 01:20:33,933
The Cleric was implemented

775
01:20:34,033 --> 01:20:35,833
and sent out to search
and destroy

776
01:20:35,933 --> 01:20:37,433
such objects that remained

777
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:41,632
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

778
01:20:41,632 --> 01:20:43,632
The Council...

779
01:21:24,327 --> 01:21:26,327
The incineration...
has it gone through?!

780
01:21:26,326 --> 01:21:28,126
It's going through now.

781
01:21:28,226 --> 01:21:29,726
Hey!

782
01:21:57,423 --> 01:22:00,523
Machine turbines priming.

783
01:22:00,622 --> 01:22:02,222
Machine turbines priming.

784
01:22:02,323 --> 01:22:04,323
Tetragrammaton... I need
to speak to this woman!

785
01:22:04,423 --> 01:22:06,023
You're too late, sir.
The time lock is engaged.

786
01:22:06,122 --> 01:22:07,322
If we force the door now,

787
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:08,922
the turbines will explode
at street level.

788
01:22:09,022 --> 01:22:12,422
...personnel,
clear the area immediately.

789
01:22:12,521 --> 01:22:16,921
All unauthorized personnel,
clear the area immediately.

790
01:22:17,021 --> 01:22:20,121
Turbines primed.

791
01:22:20,121 --> 01:22:22,821
Fire in 10 seconds...

792
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,720
9 seconds...

793
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,120
8 seconds...

794
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,520
7 seconds...

795
01:22:27,519 --> 01:22:29,819
6 seconds...

796
01:22:29,919 --> 01:22:31,919
5 seconds...

797
01:22:32,019 --> 01:22:33,119
4 seconds...

798
01:22:33,219 --> 01:22:34,819
3 seconds...

799
01:22:34,918 --> 01:22:37,418
2 seconds...

800
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:40,719
Turbines... fire.

801
01:23:31,412 --> 01:23:34,712
Cleric John Preston...

802
01:23:40,411 --> 01:23:42,311
You are under arrest.

803
01:23:44,011 --> 01:23:45,811
This man...

804
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:48,210
this senior Cleric...

805
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:50,110
has ceased the dose.

806
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:53,810
He is feeling!

807
01:23:53,809 --> 01:23:57,709
He is the worm that has been
eating at the core

808
01:23:57,809 --> 01:24:00,609
of our great society!

809
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:02,409
And I...

810
01:24:02,408 --> 01:24:05,408
I have brought him
for your justice.

811
01:24:05,408 --> 01:24:07,108
Ugh!

812
01:24:09,707 --> 01:24:14,007
I told you I'd make my career
with you, Preston.

813
01:24:15,007 --> 01:24:16,507
Vice-Council...

814
01:24:16,606 --> 01:24:18,806
This man is guilty

815
01:24:18,906 --> 01:24:20,706
of consorting
with sense offenders,

816
01:24:20,706 --> 01:24:24,006
of having relations
with a female,

817
01:24:24,106 --> 01:24:27,306
of sense crime itself.

818
01:24:27,405 --> 01:24:29,705
Dispatch a search team
to the Cleric's quarters

819
01:24:29,805 --> 01:24:30,805
to search for unused...

820
01:24:30,905 --> 01:24:32,205
Uh, that won't be
necessary, sir.

821
01:24:32,204 --> 01:24:34,004
If you'll run the trace
record on his side arm,

822
01:24:34,105 --> 01:24:36,305
you will find
that it was he

823
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:39,204
who was with the sweeper team
when they were murdered.

824
01:24:44,803 --> 01:24:46,203
Cleric...

825
01:24:46,203 --> 01:24:48,503
I assume you have something
to say to me.

826
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:53,103
I know...

827
01:24:53,202 --> 01:24:54,702
it's hard to believe...

828
01:24:57,302 --> 01:25:00,202
...that a Cleric
of the Tetragrammaton

829
01:25:00,301 --> 01:25:03,401
could turn his back
on everything he's been taught,

830
01:25:03,401 --> 01:25:05,901
would become associated
with the Resistance,

831
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:10,201
even becoming a champion
in its Underground.

832
01:25:10,301 --> 01:25:12,301
But it's true.

833
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:20,700
I promised that I would
bring you that man.

834
01:25:20,799 --> 01:25:21,799
And I have.

835
01:25:24,699 --> 01:25:26,899
- Cleric Brandt...
- Sir?

836
01:25:26,999 --> 01:25:29,899
The trace shows
that it was your gun

837
01:25:29,898 --> 01:25:32,598
in the Nether
with the sweepers.

838
01:25:32,597 --> 01:25:34,197
That's impossible.

839
01:25:38,697 --> 01:25:41,697
This is wrong.

840
01:25:41,697 --> 01:25:44,497
I think, in the end...

841
01:25:44,597 --> 01:25:47,497
it'll be better
if you have it.

842
01:25:47,596 --> 01:25:49,296
He switched them.

843
01:25:50,295 --> 01:25:52,095
He switched them.

844
01:25:52,195 --> 01:25:53,895
See, I have his gun now.

845
01:25:53,995 --> 01:25:56,695
Of course you do. You took it
when you arrested me.

846
01:25:56,795 --> 01:25:57,695
What?

847
01:25:57,795 --> 01:25:59,995
Take him
to the Hall of Destruction

848
01:26:00,095 --> 01:26:02,395
for summary judgment
and combustion.

849
01:26:02,395 --> 01:26:04,895
Wait, wait, wait. Wait!
I can explain this.

850
01:26:04,894 --> 01:26:08,094
Uh, sir, I'm not feeling!

851
01:26:08,093 --> 01:26:10,493
He is the one who's feeling!

852
01:26:10,593 --> 01:26:12,193
This is a mistake!

853
01:26:14,293 --> 01:26:16,093
Of course...

854
01:26:16,092 --> 01:26:18,992
since a complaint
has been lodged,

855
01:26:19,093 --> 01:26:21,993
law and the letter
is that I allow a team

856
01:26:22,092 --> 01:26:24,492
to carry out the search
of your premises.

857
01:26:24,591 --> 01:26:26,691
Do you think that's entirely
necessary, Cleric,

858
01:26:26,791 --> 01:26:30,791
or am I being
too... exacting?

859
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:33,191
As you say, sir,

860
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:35,191
it's the law and the letter.

861
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:38,290
And it doesn't disturb you
in the least

862
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,690
that your colleague
is going to his end?

863
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:43,190
The only thing
that disturbs me, sir,

864
01:26:43,289 --> 01:26:45,989
is that I am Father's instrument
against the Underground,

865
01:26:46,089 --> 01:26:51,189
and yet... I've never had
the honor of meeting him.

866
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,189
Hmm.

867
01:26:53,288 --> 01:26:54,988
Yes, but, Cleric, you know

868
01:26:55,088 --> 01:26:58,088
that Father never grants
an audience to anyone.

869
01:26:58,188 --> 01:27:00,588
Even to the man
who brings him the Resistance?

870
01:27:12,986 --> 01:27:14,686
Sorry, sir.
Just a formality.

871
01:27:14,786 --> 01:27:16,886
The search team will be up
momentarily.

872
01:27:16,985 --> 01:27:19,585
Excellent.
I have nothing to hide.

873
01:27:39,683 --> 01:27:41,883
The search teams are
already inside, sir.

874
01:27:41,883 --> 01:27:43,183
Excellent.

875
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,380
Looking for something?

876
01:28:11,179 --> 01:28:12,879
If I were you...

877
01:28:12,979 --> 01:28:18,079
I'd be more careful
in the future.

878
01:28:23,177 --> 01:28:24,477
How long?

879
01:28:24,578 --> 01:28:26,878
Since Mom.

880
01:28:29,777 --> 01:28:30,877
And Lisa?

881
01:28:30,977 --> 01:28:32,277
Of course.

882
01:28:37,076 --> 01:28:38,676
How did you know?

883
01:28:38,776 --> 01:28:41,276
You forget...

884
01:28:41,376 --> 01:28:43,776
it's my job to know
what you're thinking.

885
01:28:46,974 --> 01:28:49,474
Then you know what
I'm gonna do now.

886
01:28:51,474 --> 01:28:53,274
You have a message
for the Vice-Council?

887
01:28:53,274 --> 01:28:54,974
You have a message
for the Vice-Council?

888
01:28:55,073 --> 01:28:56,973
It's done.

889
01:28:56,974 --> 01:29:00,374
I've located the Resistance.

890
01:29:00,473 --> 01:29:02,773
Come now.

891
01:29:02,873 --> 01:29:04,873
You'll have them all.

892
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:30,370
Do not address Father
unless first addressed by him.

893
01:29:30,369 --> 01:29:31,669
Avoid eye contact.

894
01:29:31,769 --> 01:29:34,969
If you should break
his personal security zone,

895
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:37,569
you will be immediately
put down by snipers.

896
01:29:37,668 --> 01:29:39,268
Is that understood?

897
01:29:39,369 --> 01:29:42,469
You'll be required to surrender
your firearm, of course,

898
01:29:42,568 --> 01:29:44,568
and then there's the test.

899
01:29:44,568 --> 01:29:45,968
Test?

900
01:29:46,967 --> 01:29:49,367
Yes.

901
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:52,467
You didn't imagine
we would risk exposing Father

902
01:29:52,567 --> 01:29:54,967
to even such a dedicated servant
as yourself

903
01:29:55,067 --> 01:29:58,367
without first having
tested you, did you?

904
01:30:02,166 --> 01:30:03,966
Please.

905
01:30:17,864 --> 01:30:19,264
Cleric...

906
01:30:19,363 --> 01:30:21,363
your weapon, please.

907
01:30:25,863 --> 01:30:27,963
Here.

908
01:30:32,862 --> 01:30:33,962
Sit.

909
01:30:37,362 --> 01:30:39,562
We'll start with
a test question first.

910
01:30:39,662 --> 01:30:42,962
More of a riddle, actually.

911
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:46,461
What would you say
is the easiest way

912
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,760
to get a weapon away
from a Grammaton Cleric?

913
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,960
You ask him for it.

914
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:07,058
I told you I'd make
my career with you, Cleric.

915
01:31:10,558 --> 01:31:11,858
...to combine the capacity...

916
01:31:13,757 --> 01:31:14,757
Preston...

917
01:31:14,757 --> 01:31:17,257
Brandt's job was simple...

918
01:31:17,357 --> 01:31:19,857
to make you feel
like you'd won,

919
01:31:19,857 --> 01:31:23,057
to make you feel safe.

920
01:31:26,256 --> 01:31:29,756
For years, I tried
to infiltrate an agent

921
01:31:29,855 --> 01:31:31,355
into the Underground...

922
01:31:32,855 --> 01:31:34,855
...until it hit me...

923
01:31:34,955 --> 01:31:38,655
in order to pass undetected
into their midst,

924
01:31:38,754 --> 01:31:41,454
in order to be trusted by them,

925
01:31:41,554 --> 01:31:46,954
my provocateur would
have to think like them

926
01:31:46,953 --> 01:31:49,853
and would have to feel
like them.

927
01:31:49,953 --> 01:31:52,853
But where to find
such a man...

928
01:31:52,952 --> 01:31:58,252
a man with the capacity to feel
who didn't yet know it?

929
01:32:01,251 --> 01:32:03,951
But...

930
01:32:03,952 --> 01:32:05,252
we've never met.

931
01:32:05,351 --> 01:32:07,151
No?

932
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:14,751
Don't look so surprised,
Preston.

933
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:16,650
Why should Father be more real

934
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:19,150
than any other
political puppet?

935
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:22,150
The real Father died
years ago.

936
01:32:22,249 --> 01:32:24,149
The Council simply elected me

937
01:32:24,249 --> 01:32:27,149
to pursue
his paternal tradition.

938
01:32:27,248 --> 01:32:29,348
And you, Preston,

939
01:32:29,448 --> 01:32:32,348
the supposed savior
of the Resistance,

940
01:32:32,348 --> 01:32:34,248
are now its destroyer,

941
01:32:34,347 --> 01:32:39,047
and, along with them,
you've given me yourself...

942
01:32:39,147 --> 01:32:40,847
calmly...

943
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:42,747
cooly...

944
01:32:42,847 --> 01:32:47,547
entirely without incident.

945
01:32:51,646 --> 01:32:53,246
No.

946
01:32:54,846 --> 01:32:55,846
Oh...

947
01:32:56,645 --> 01:32:57,745
Shit.

948
01:32:59,745 --> 01:33:01,445
Not without incident.

949
01:33:08,444 --> 01:33:09,944
I'm coming.

950
01:34:38,934 --> 01:34:40,734
You really should learn
to knock.

951
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:10,730
How did it feel, Preston?

952
01:35:24,328 --> 01:35:26,528
- Agh!
- Ugh! Ugh! Uhh-ah!

953
01:35:28,427 --> 01:35:29,827
Wah!

954
01:35:29,927 --> 01:35:31,627
Ugh! Agh! Uhh!

955
01:35:31,627 --> 01:35:33,227
Ugh!

956
01:35:34,426 --> 01:35:35,526
Ugh!

957
01:35:35,626 --> 01:35:37,626
- Aggh!
- Aggh!

958
01:35:51,525 --> 01:35:54,325
Mind the uniform, Cleric.

959
01:35:59,924 --> 01:36:03,124
I plan to be wearing it
for a long time.

960
01:36:38,919 --> 01:36:41,619
Be careful, Preston.

961
01:36:41,618 --> 01:36:44,018
You're treading on my dreams.

962
01:37:19,114 --> 01:37:20,414
Ohh!

963
01:37:20,414 --> 01:37:22,214
Wait!

964
01:37:22,313 --> 01:37:23,313
Wait.

965
01:37:23,413 --> 01:37:24,813
Look at me.

966
01:37:24,914 --> 01:37:26,014
Look at me.

967
01:37:28,113 --> 01:37:29,813
I'm life.

968
01:37:29,913 --> 01:37:33,313
I live, I-I breathe...

969
01:37:35,413 --> 01:37:36,913
I feel.

970
01:37:38,912 --> 01:37:41,712
Now that you know it...

971
01:37:41,812 --> 01:37:44,612
can you really take it?

972
01:37:44,711 --> 01:37:46,711
Is it really worth the price?

973
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:54,510
I pay it gladly.

974
01:38:13,308 --> 01:38:16,708
The following items
have been rated EC-10...

975
01:38:16,807 --> 01:38:18,107
condemned.

976
01:38:25,107 --> 01:38:26,207
In the 19th century...

977
01:38:32,805 --> 01:38:35,505
...world to its knees.

978
01:38:35,605 --> 01:38:39,405
Two millennia ago...

979
01:38:39,505 --> 01:38:41,105
in his conquest
of the known world,

980
01:38:41,204 --> 01:38:42,704
Alexander the Great
slaughtered

981
01:38:42,804 --> 01:38:45,504
more than one million
human beings.

982
01:38:47,204 --> 01:38:50,604
Three centuries later,
purely out of jealousy,

983
01:38:50,703 --> 01:38:54,003
Gaius Germanicus, "Caligula,"
murdered his own sister,

984
01:38:54,003 --> 01:38:56,703
impregnated
with his own child.

985
01:38:56,802 --> 01:38:57,902
In the...

986
01:39:09,102 --> 01:39:12,102
...items have been rated
EC-10...

987
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:16,201
...rated condemned,
destroyed.

988
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,200
...items have been rated...
