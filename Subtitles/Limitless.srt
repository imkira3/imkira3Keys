2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:53,250


3
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,750
Obviously,
I miscalculated a few things.

4
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:02,666


5
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:07,750
Eddie!
I know you're in there!

6
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:12,583


7
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:16,041
Why is it that the moment your life
exceeds your wildest dreams...

8
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,666
The access code
you have entered...

9
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,041
the knife appears at your back?

10
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:23,416
The access code
you have entered is invalid...

11
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:27,833
Well, I'll tell you one thing...

12
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:49,083


13
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,375
I will never let them touch me.

14
00:01:52,416 --> 00:02:04,500


15
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,208
My neighbor, who must have
opened his door to complain.

16
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:11,666
You're gonna be next, Eddie!
We're coming in!

17
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:12,708


18
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,625
For a guy with a four digit IQ,
I must have missed something.

19
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,500
And I hadn't missed much.

20
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,000


21
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,416
I'd come this close to having
an impact on the world.

22
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:23,916


23
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,333
And now, the only thing
I'd have an impact on...

24
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,125
was the sidewalk.

25
00:02:30,166 --> 00:03:51,125


26
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,833
You see that guy?

27
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,750
That was me, not so long ago.

28
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,541
What kind of guy without a drug or
alcohol problem looks this way?

29
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,708
Only a writer Strangely enough,

30
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,458
nobody believed that
I actually had a book contract.

31
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,250
Well, it's masquerading
as a sci-fi novel,

32
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,000
but it's really
my own personal manifesto

33
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,000
about the plight of the
individual in the 21st century.

34
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,333
I sort of created a utopian society

35
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,625
where we all sort of...

36
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,333
it's really... it's really...

37
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:24,541


38
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,666
Today was the day
I was gonna kick its ass.

39
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,625
Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go...

40
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,208


41
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,375
It was gonna be great.

42
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,083
Just gotta put in the time.
Stay in the room.

43
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:38,708


44
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,875
That's the key concept.

45
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,541
Don't leave the room.

46
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:51,000


47
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,583
A few weeks passed this way.

48
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,875
Maybe a few months.

49
00:04:55,916 --> 00:05:00,958


50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
At least I still had Lindy.

51
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,416


52
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,833
Just like that?

53
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:13,291
Come on, Eddie.
This is hardly a surprise.

54
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,833
I'm surprised.

55
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:16,750


56
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,166
Let's just not do this, OK?
Let me...

57
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,958
I'm gonna hand in
90 pages to Marla on Friday.

58
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,500
If you just wait to see
what she says...

59
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,791
Eddie.

60
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,791
- What?
- I know how it's going.

61
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,666
I'm your...

62
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,833
I was your girlfriend.

63
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,458
That word doesn't even begin
to describe what you are to me.

64
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,916
Partner? Squeeze?

65
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,875
Paramour. Inamorata.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,041
Cleaning lady. Bank.

67
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:44,833


68
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,625
Thanks. Be right back.

69
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,000
Be that a...

70
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,500
What's mine is yours, too,

71
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,958
and you know I want to share
the rest of my life with you.

72
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,041
- I was thinking that we should...
- Don't propose.

73
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,000
Why not?

74
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,250
Because it worked out
so well for you last time.

75
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,458
It's true, I did many once.
Right out of college, to Melissa.

76
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,750
I do.

77
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,708
Briefly.

78
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,958
This isn't working.

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,083


80
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,291
Well, even though everything you
say is true, I still love you.

81
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:22,333


82
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,166
I gotta get back to work.

83
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,541


84
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,166
You didn't even
tell me what happened.

85
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,916
- I got it.
- You did?

86
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,291
I'm an editor.

87
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,541
I'll have my own assistant.
Can you believe that?

88
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,375
Yeah, of course I believe it.
You deserve it.

89
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,916


90
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,916
Thanks.

91
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,208


92
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,458
- OK.
- OK.

93
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:54,000


94
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,958
She was right.
Why stick it out?

95
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,750
I had clearly missed the on-ramp.

96
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,625
We both knew what was beckoning.

97
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,958
The lower bunk in my
childhood bedroom in Jersey.

98
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,625
My father happy to welcome me
into the challenging field

99
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,333
of dental supply inventory.

100
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,500
Eddie Morra.

101
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,708


102
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,958
Of all the useless
relationships better forgotten

103
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,583
and put away in mothballs,

104
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,625
is there any more useless than...
the ex-brother-in-law?

105
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,958
Holy shit, man.

106
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,958
What has it been?
Like nine years?

107
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,166
- God!
- Hey.

108
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,958
You all right? You look like
you're living on the streets.

109
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,916
What's going on?

110
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,250
Not much, I... Well...
What am I... What's up?

111
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,416
I'm writing. Writing a lot.

112
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,833
You're still trying to write?

113
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,083
Matter of fact,
I have a book contract.

114
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,291
- Really?
- Yeah.

115
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,875
- That's great.
- How about you?

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,375
Are you still dealing, Vern?

117
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,166
- Do I look like I'm still dealing?
- No, you don't. No.

118
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,791
Come on, let's go get a drink.
I want to hear about this book.

119
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,583
I don't know.
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

120
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,500
When has that ever stopped you?

121
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,916


122
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,458
- So.
- So...

123
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,166
How's Melissa doing?

124
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,916
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

125
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:10,125
Wouldn't know. I don't see her.
She moved upstate.

126
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,791
She got some kind of Internet home sales
kind of job. Couple kids.

127
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:18,708
Couple kids.
Who's the husband?

128
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:22,416
He walked out on her,
if you really want to know.

129
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,625
But what do you care, man?

130
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,166
You were married,
like, five minutes.

131
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,166
Look, I don't wanna talk about her.
I wanna talk about you, OK?

132
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,958
Tell me about this book.
How's it going?

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,541


134
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,291
Well, it's...

135
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,666
I'm... I'm...

136
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,666
I'm behind.
I'm behind on my book.

137
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,125
And it's pretty well
polluting my days and nights,

138
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,000
if you really want to know.

139
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,541
- Well, how much have you written of it?
- Not one word.

140
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:52,958
- Creative problems?
- Yeah.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,958


142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,916
Well, I suppose
I can help you with that.

143
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,541
Just this once.

144
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,333
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

145
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,916
- You don't even know what it is.
- You're still dealing.

146
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,583
Brother, I am light years
from that now.

147
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:12,791
I've been doing some consulting
for a pharmaceutical company.

148
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,625
What, like some offshore lab
making fake Viagra? Come on, Vern.

149
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,541
No. This is an exclusive product
that's coming on stream next year.

150
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:24,208
They've had clinical trials
and it's FDA approved.

151
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,375
All right, just out of curiosity
and that's all...

152
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,416


153
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,708
Let's see it.

154
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,916


155
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,583
What's in it?

156
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,875
They've identified these receptors
in the brain

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,750
that activate specific circuits.

158
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:44,083
And you how they say that we can
only access 20 percent of our brain?

159
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:49,541
Well, what this does...
it lets you access all of it.

160
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:49,958


161
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,291
Vern, look at me. Do I look good to you?
I'm broke and I'm depressed off my ass.

162
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,916
I don't think that my life's
gonna take some sudden upswing

163
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,208
into fame and fortune by taking
some shiny, brand-new designer drug.

164
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,000
Gant.

165
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,416
When?

166
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:07,416
Tell him we can't do that.
No, you tell him.

167
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,375


168
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,458
No, now.

169
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:10,958


170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,791
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to leave you here, Eddie.

171
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,541
But I really... I really do
want to do this again.

172
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:21,708
So, call me.
And that's on the house.

173
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,708
I don't want it.

174
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,500
Don't be ungrateful.
You know how much that costs?

175
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,125
Eight hundred bucks. A pop.

176
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,375
You're welcome.

177
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:43,000


178
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,708
All the way home,
I thought about Melissa.

179
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,250
How could she be a failure, too?
She'd been so smart.

180
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,416
Smarter than anyone around her.

181
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,875
Clearly, there was a direct link
between this Eddie,

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,958
slightly drunk at 3:00 in the afternoon,
and an earlier Eddie...

183
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,041
vomiting on his boss's desk
or stealing his dying aunt's Percocet.

184
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:03,875


185
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:07,791
So who could blame Lindy
for dumping me?

186
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:15,791


187
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,791
In the end,
how much worse could it get?

188
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:27,208


189
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,250
I didn't want to see anybody.

190
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,166
Especially not my landlord's
nasty young wife.

191
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,583
- Valerie, Tuesday.
- Look. Enough, OK?

192
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,958
Steve handles the rent,
so you can feed your crap to him.

193
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,958
I suddenly had extra reason
to get away from hen

194
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,791
I had thoughtlessly ingested
a substance.

195
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,291
Like the rent's not low enough!

196
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,041
I had gotten remarkably
little information from Vernon

197
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,833
about what this drug would do.

198
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,500
You could even be a bike messenger
and come up with that. Really.

199
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,875
- What if it was a hallucinogen?
- It's pathetic.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,291
Oh, my God.
Listening to her rag...

201
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,083
If I were tripping,
I'd jump out a fucking window.

202
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,291
Hello?
Are you listening to me?

203
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,416
Do you get it?
You are gonna be out on the streets!

204
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,125
And then, I felt it.

205
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:36,291


206
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,375
I was blind, but now I see.

207
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:53,500


208
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,041
Running away! You can't
even look at me, you know why?

209
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,333
Because you're not even a man.
You're not even a man!

210
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,666
You don't have rent!
You don't have a job!

211
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:13,125


212
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,250
- What's wrong?
- What?

213
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,791
You don't like me and I don't blame you.
You see a self-defeating,

214
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,583
energy-sucking piece of shit
who's sponging off your husband.

215
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,000
You're wishing
I'd blow my brains out,

216
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,875
but my existence shouldn't make you
this upset. What is it?

217
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,708
- That's none of your business.
- Something wrong at law school?

218
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,166
How do you know
I'm in law school?

219
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,875
People who aren't,
usually don't carry around dry,

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,125
academically-constipated books
about a dead Supreme Court justice.

221
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,541
You're a creep, aren't you?
You've been... you've been following me.

222
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,666
- No, I just noticed the book.
- You just saw the corner of it.

223
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,125
How did you know that?

224
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,291
I'd seen it before.
Twelve years ago in college.

225
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,625
Sitting on the couch of a TA
I was trying to make,

226
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,458
waiting for her to come
back out of the bathroom,

227
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,500
hoping she'd have a condom.

228
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,125
Somehow my unconscious
had served that up.

229
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,750
A memory I had never even recorded.

230
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,541
Or was it there the whole time
and all I needed was the access?

231
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,750
If you're writing a paper,
that's not the book I'd use.

232
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,625
Well, who asked you?

233
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,625
Hastings has his oral history.
I'd start there.

234
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,791
Interesting point.
Grammatically, this guy was an idiot,

235
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,208
which sort of gives credence
to the theory

236
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,291
that one of the clerks he had fired

237
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,500
actually wrote most of
this guy's major opinions.

238
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,916
You could Google the clerk's sons,
they'd love to talk to you.

239
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,666
Exonerate their dad. That'd give you
something that no one else has...

240
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,500
information from the odd
museum show, a half-read article,

241
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,625
some PBS documentary... it was all
bubbling up in my frontal lobes,

242
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,041
mixing itself together into a sparkling
cocktail of useful information.

243
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,208


244
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,958
- She didn't have a chance.
- So, what are your suggestions?

245
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,916


246
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,833
We'd really worked
on her paper, too.

247
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:44,416
In 45 minutes, it was a polished gem.
She was pleased.

248
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:49,750


249
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:54,291
Home. But it couldn't be my home,
could it?

250
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,708
Who would live like this?

251
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,458


252
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,875
Torch it.

253
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,833
But saner heads prevailed.

254
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:38,125


255
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,458
What was this drug?
I couldn't stay messy on it,

256
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:45,375
I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours,
hadn't eaten, so... abstemious and tidy?

257
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,916
What was this? A drug for people who
wanted to be more anal retentive?

258
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,791
I wasn't high, I wasn't wired.
Just clear.

259
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:55,250
I knew what I needed to do
and how to do it.

260
00:15:55,291 --> 00:16:32,125


261
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:37,541
The next morning, I sent
a little probe down into my brain.

262
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:42,083
No surge of brilliance
came up to greet me.

263
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,583


264
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:48,708
In short... I was back.

265
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,500


266
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,291
But, something remained.

267
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,541


268
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,416
You're kidding.

269
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,625
- No.
- Words have appeared on paper.

270
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,666
- Yes.
- Written by you.

271
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,125
All you have to do is read three pages.

272
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,291
Just read three pages
in the next hour and...

273
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,791
if you don't want to keep reading,
I'll give you back the advance.

274
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,541


275
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,916
OK.

276
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:20,416


277
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,541
- OK, Eddie.
- OK.

278
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:49,583


279
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,458
Eddie, give me a call
when you get in.

280
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,625


281
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:58,250
Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in.
Call me.

282
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,458
It's a little grandiose,
but I'm still reading.

283
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:05,291
OK, how did you do this?

284
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:11,416
I'd really like... Just call me
the minute you get in. Call. OK?

285
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:26,541


286
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,791
- Who is it?
- Hey, Vernon, it's Eddie.

287
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:35,250
- Eddie who?
- Morra.

288
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,625


289
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,791
It's not a good time, Eddie.

290
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:42,916
Hey, Vern, I really
just need to talk to you.

291
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:43,500


292
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,125
Hey...

293
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,250


294
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:52,750
- Vern, what happened?
- Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

295
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,833
So, Eddie.
You are interested after all.

296
00:18:55,958 --> 00:19:00,375
- That stuff's amazing.
- Works better if you're already smart.

297
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,666
Vern, who did this to you?

298
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,125
Trust me, you don't want to know.

299
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,708


300
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,750
- So, what's it called?
- Doesn't have a street name yet.

301
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,625
But the boys in the kitchen
are calling it NZT 48.

302
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,916
"The boys in the kitchen"?
I don't...

303
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,375
That doesn't sound
very FDA-approved, Vern.

304
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:29,000
FDA-approved, that's a laugh.
You didn't really believe that shit, did you?

305
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:29,541


306
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,125
OK, so what do we have here?

307
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,375
Some unknown, untested,
possibly dangerous drug

308
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,791
scammed out of some
unidentified lab somewhere

309
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:41,250
given to me by a highly unreliable guy
I hadn't seen in years.

310
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,083
- So you want some more?
- Yes. Definitely.

311
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,208


312
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,125
All right, we'll talk about it,
but I need a favor first.

313
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,416
Obviously, I'm in no condition
to go out right now, so,

314
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:59,125
I was wondering if you could pop down to
the dry cleaners, grab my suit for me.

315
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:04,458
And maybe grab a little...
a little breakfast for us.

316
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,541


317
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,500
He knew he had me.

318
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,458
Sure.

319
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,500
From now on,
I'd happily be his errand boy.

320
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,875
Wash his windows,
scrub his toilet...

321
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,708
anything I could do to get my hands
on that little clear pill

322
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,750
that would bring back...
Enhanced Eddie.

323
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:34,333


324
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,750
Vern?

325
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:46,000


326
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,625
Vern?

327
00:20:48,666 --> 00:21:10,375


328
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,666
Vern...

329
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,416


330
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,416
Oh, Vern.

331
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:54,666


332
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:59,125
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Hi, I need to report a...

333
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,541
a murder.

334
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,958


335
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,458
7B, yes.

336
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,375


337
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,750
OK, I won't.

338
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,375


339
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:16,958
Took them forever. And the longer
I stood there, the clearer I saw.

340
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,041
Vern had known
whoever had done this.

341
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,958
And one guess what
they'd been looking fan.

342
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,666


343
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,291
But had they found it?

344
00:22:30,333 --> 00:23:08,791


345
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:12,791
Shit, if you ever cooked,
I'd be dead, too.

346
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:46,083


347
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:50,083
Police Department!
Open the door, please!

348
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,750


349
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:55,500
Police Department!
Open the door!

350
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,708


351
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:03,958
Open the door, please!

352
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,500


353
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,625
Police! Open the door!

354
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,625
Let's go! Open the door!

355
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,000
- Let me see your hands.
- Hey.

356
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,041
- Let me see your hands!
- No, no, I'm the one who called!

357
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,458
I called you guys!

358
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,666


359
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:20,458
So, you guys tight?
Hang out a lot?

360
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:24,333
No, my ex-wife's brother. I just
actually ran into him on the street

361
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,958
- and he asked me to come up to...
- Buy some drugs?

362
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:30,916
- No, no. What?
- What did this guy do?

363
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:34,291
He... I don't know.
He was...

364
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:36,791
I heard that he was
an antiques dealer?

365
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:40,708
- A dealer?
- Yeah, antiques.

366
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:44,708
Like Viennese kinda...

367
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,666
chairs and stuff.

368
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:49,458
Like, you know,
like curlicue leg things.

369
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,500
Yeah?

370
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,666
That is correct.
An Edward Morra.

371
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,958
He's here.

372
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,416
Victim's sister.

373
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,958
I hadn't heard her voice
in ten years.

374
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:06,375
- Eddie?
- Melissa?

375
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,375
You were there?

376
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,541
Just before. I had run into him
on the street and... yeah.

377
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:16,416
Oh, God.

378
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:20,583
I wish I was more surprised.
He was involved in some stuff

379
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,125
I'd better not say any more.

380
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,375
No, no, that's probably a good idea.

381
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,000
So... we should probably
meet or something, right?

382
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:34,791
No, I gotta do the funeral
and God knows what else. I just...

383
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:37,083
We can't meet, OK?

384
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,500
Right. Well, I'll just... I guess I'll
just see you at the funeral then.

385
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,916
No. I don't want that. Please don't.
I'll call you at some point, OK?

386
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,000
- When this is over.
- OK, all right.

387
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,208
OK.

388
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,916


389
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:56,458
You know,
something doesn't gel here.

390
00:25:56,583 --> 00:26:01,041
Write down your number.
I may need to contact you later.

391
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:32,625


392
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:35,958
Worth the risk?

393
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,375


394
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:43,166
What would you do?

395
00:26:43,208 --> 00:27:12,416


396
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:16,583
Vern's cash, combined with
an unprecedented surge of motivation,

397
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:22,166
enabled me to finish the book
in four days.

398
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:30,083


399
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,583
A tablet a day

400
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,958
and what I could do
with my day was limitless.

401
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,416
I learned to play
the piano in three days.

402
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:39,833


403
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:42,208
Math became useful.

404
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,416
And fun.

405
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:45,958
I'm all in.

406
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,333


407
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:53,166
Even half-listening
to any language, I became fluent.

408
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:59,833


409
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:03,083
So that Shakespeare's catchiness
belies mediocrity?

410
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,041
There's no arguing with you.

411
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,500


412
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,791
This was great.

413
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:11,583
So, Mom, I've been doing a little
research on Aunt Helen's tumor.

414
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:15,250
And it's totally clear that anybody with
familial adenomatous polyposis

415
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,541
should be supplementing
platinum-based doublet regiments

416
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:19,000
with eicosapentaeonic acid.

417
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,625
I suddenly knew everything.
About everything.

418
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,208
Well, sure, you get a short-term spike,
but wouldn't that rapid expansion

419
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,041
devalue that stock completely
in two years?

420
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,625
- No, because there are safeguards.
- Against aggressive over-expansion?

421
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,041
There aren't. Because there are
no safeguards in human nature.

422
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,625
We're wired to overreach.

423
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,916
Look at history, all the countries
that ever ruled the world.

424
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,500
Portugal with this big
massive navy.

425
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,375
All they got now are salt cod
and cheap condoms.

426
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,416
And the Brits?

427
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,583
Now they're just sitting on a dank
little island fussing over their suits.

428
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,333
No one's stopping and thinking,
"Hey, we're doing pretty well.

429
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,833
We got France, we got Poland,
we got a big Swiss bank account.

430
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,583
You know what?
Let's not invade Russia in the winter.

431
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:50,458
"Let's go home, let's pop a beer,
and let's live off the interest."

432
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,625
Yeah.

433
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,416
My brain was just
pouring this stuff out.

434
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:58,166
Everything I had ever read, heard,
seen was now organized and available.

435
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:00,291
Here it is. Here you go.

436
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:03,208
Eddie. Hey. Listen,
I'm sure you have a portfolio,

437
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:06,458
but if you don't, I'd be very
interested in working with you.

438
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:09,375
OK, Kevin.

439
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,625
I made some new friends
who invited me to the beach.

440
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,541
The beach was not nearby.

441
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:27,083


442
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,750
All my feel,
all my shyness, gone.

443
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:32,583
They've done four basic trials...

444
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:36,083
But mere lounging wasn't enough.

445
00:29:36,125 --> 00:30:00,375


446
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:03,375
Only problem?
If I wasn't moving forward,

447
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,708
I felt like I was
going to explode.

448
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,916
Come up here because
it's beautiful, right?

449
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:11,750
- Anybody ever jump?
- Are you crazy?

450
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:15,333


451
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:18,166
- He's gonna do it.
- He's not gonna do it.

452
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,333


453
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,250
Oh, my God!

454
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:37,000


455
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:41,041
And then I began to form an idea.

456
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,541
Suddenly, I knew exactly
what I needed to do.

457
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:46,208
It wasn't writing.
It wasn't books.

458
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:49,208
It was much bigger than that.

459
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,083


460
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,833
But it would take money
to get there.

461
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:55,916


462
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:59,416
In a down market,
no one was making much.

463
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,000
But no one had NZT.

464
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,291
In an optimistic scenario,

465
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,208
gains of that nature
merely would reflect

466
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:09,083
growth in the economy
and would not pose an obstacle...

467
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:14,750


468
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:20,000
Armed with Vern's last $800,
I made 2,000 in a day.

469
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,416
Next day, 7,500.

470
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:26,541
It was too slow.
I'd need more capital.

471
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:28,916
But banks weren't lending
to guys like me.

472
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:29,958
Hey, Liev.

473
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:33,416
That's your man
in the corner back there.

474
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,666


475
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,750
Yeah.

476
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:46,083


477
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:50,750
So, Liev told you that
I'm looking for a short-term loan?

478
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,250
Yeah, and I told Liev forget it.

479
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,291
Why?

480
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:58,458
Because I don't see you before
and I don't fucking like you already.

481
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,750
Why do l give you $100,000?

482
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:04,041
Because...

483
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:05,000


484
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:08,708
I quintupled my money
four days in a row.

485
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,750
So you got a fix on the game.

486
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,583
No, not a fix.

487
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:15,041
I was able to calculate certain patterns
using algorithms.

488
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,416
If you look at column four,
this was the first...

489
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:19,958


490
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,875
You're good.

491
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,416


492
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,291
OK, it's a fix.

493
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,541
Yeah, you know,
all you people get caught.

494
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:31,458
What are you gonna do then?

495
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:31,916


496
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:34,375
Well, it's not as if I have
a black book with your name in it,

497
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,250
if that's what you're
talking about.

498
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,583
And besides,
I get the strong feeling

499
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:42,416
that you're not somebody
I want to disappoint.

500
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:46,541


501
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,125
Don't get up.
I said don't get up.

502
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,416
- Sit down!
- Hey. OK.

503
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:51,541


504
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,750
- OK, you take this, you mine.
- OK.

505
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:58,458
You understand?
You don't pay, you know what we do?

506
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,583
I cut you at waist.

507
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:04,416
Peel your skin up over your head
and tie knot in it.

508
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:06,916
You don't die from this.
You suffocate.

509
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:10,250
- OK.
- Good luck.

510
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:17,291


511
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,083
My new friend, Kevin Doyle,
showed me how you could leverage

512
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:24,083
two and a half times your cash
at the day trading firm.

513
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:26,916
I'd been upping the dose
for over a week.

514
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,291


515
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:31,750
It seemed to cut my learning curve.

516
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:45,333


517
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:48,125
Why are you buying that?
The CEO was just indicted.

518
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,041
But not for the big fat defense contract
he bribed his way into.

519
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,541
That's still on.
Should be announced next week.

520
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:56,500
I was jacked in. Booted up.

521
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,375
At the end of the week,
my brokerage account

522
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,375
contained over two million dollars.

523
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:04,291
Word quickly got out.

524
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:09,291


525
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:12,250
You have 19 messages.

526
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,833
Four job offers,
my bank raising my line of credit,

527
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:16,583
a reporter from the New York Post.

528
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:18,583
Really call me back, Mn Mona.

529
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,083
No one makes money that fast.

530
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,625
This article's gonna get written
with or without you.

531
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,833
And finally,
Kevin Doyle trying to sound casual.

532
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:27,666
Eddie, I was
talking you up to my boss

533
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:30,333
and, well,
the impossible happened, bud.

534
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:33,250
We got you a meeting with Carl Van Loon.

535
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:35,791
Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?

536
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:39,541
- Apparently so.
- But you're not in the finance game.

537
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:43,125
What can you do for Carl Van Loon?

538
00:34:43,166 --> 00:35:02,583


539
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,708
Since when do you speak Italian?

540
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:07,750
Self-improvement month.

541
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,708
I guess somebody
gave me a wake up call.

542
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,208
I hope you didn't do it for me.

543
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:15,291
No, I just wanted
to apologize to you, Lin.

544
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:19,208
And let you know that apparently
my capacity for self-sabotage

545
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:22,166
wasn't boundless after all.

546
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,000


547
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:26,208
The real question is,
why did you ever put up with me?

548
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:26,750


549
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,291
I was in love with you.

550
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:35,166


551
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:36,708
So, when does the book come out?

552
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,666
Next year.
How's your new assistant?

553
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,416
- She's good.
- Good.

554
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:43,750
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

555
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:45,333


556
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,333
And are you gonna get a new...

557
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:50,250
You know...
I'm really happy you're here with me.

558
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:53,666


559
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:58,541
I'm proud of you. And...

560
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:03,666


561
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:06,250
a little intimidated.

562
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,416


563
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,875
We started up again.

564
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:12,333


565
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,458
Her place.

566
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,625


567
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:19,708
My place.

568
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,375


569
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:23,750
Basically every place.

570
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:26,541


571
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,708
"In a sizzling
three days of trading,"

572
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,583
the unknown Mr. Morra
trumped the market,

573
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:34,583
prompting one top
hedge fund manager to comment:

574
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:37,500
"He's Houdini.
He's a prophet of our times."

575
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,458
OK, give me that.
Give me that!

576
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:41,791
- "He's God"?
- You coming over later?

577
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:44,125
I can't. I don't have a key.

578
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,083
Oh, that's right.

579
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:49,666
- Can I have it back?
- Nope.

580
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,583
- No?
- I mean, does it have to be that key?

581
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:54,375
Can it be a new key?

582
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:57,250
To our place?

583
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,125


584
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:02,916
- It would be cost effective.
- And you say I'm not practical.

585
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:13,666


586
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:16,208
Can I walk you to work?

587
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:32,625


588
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:35,166
Whatcha doing, hon?

589
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:37,791
Nothing.

590
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:40,791
You should sleep.

591
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,750


592
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:45,500
Isn't your Van Loon
meeting tomorrow?

593
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:59,541


594
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,041
Eddie?

595
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,875
Are you OK?

596
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,250


597
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:09,250
What are you doing out here?

598
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:12,583


599
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,875
When's the last time
you ate something?

600
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:22,541


601
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:27,208
There he is.
Nice article in the Post, buddy.

602
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,333


603
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:31,625
OK, he is on his way.

604
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,708
Now, be warned. He's mercurial.

605
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:37,791
One minute, your best friend,
the next, you're a leper.

606
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:42,875
And he needs direct answers. Anything
tentative and you've lost him forever.

607
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:44,083


608
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,250
I think we should rehearse
a few scenarios.

609
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,041
I'm eating, Kevin.

610
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,666
Hey, are you up for this?

611
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,041
You sure? 'Cause I got
a little bit on the line here.

612
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:56,083
Have a toast point.

613
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,833


614
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,750
- it's Carl Van Loon.
- That's Carl Van Loon.

615
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:00,833
He's worth a fortune.

616
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:04,083
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Carl. Good to see you.

617
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,625
- How are ya?
- Eddie.

618
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:12,833


619
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:15,250
So, Eddie Morra.

620
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:18,375
- What's your secret?
- Medication.

621
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,625
I'm on special medication.

622
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,083
OK.

623
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:25,000


624
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,708
Well, it's a formula
with a complex method.

625
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:29,208
But, of course, research was
a component. Massive research.

626
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,375
I knew every helix of every scrap of DNA
in every company I bought.

627
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,041
Papers stacked like the Himalayas
in my office, and you know what?

628
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,291
- The stocks went up.
- By a hair.

629
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,541
Sure, the stocks rose,
but who wants to do all that work

630
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,166
for a shitty little uptake?

631
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:45,375
It's not the visceral kind of spike
you want in short term holdings so...

632
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,166
I dispensed
with all the hard statistics

633
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:48,541
and I went right to the rumor mill.

634
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,750
So you bought your stocks based on what?
The tom-toms beating in the street?

635
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:55,333
Sure. Share prices aren't really
based on how a company works.

636
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:56,875
It's about
how mass psychology works.

637
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,208
So, if I found certain algorithms
in the perception of the stock...

638
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,583
Pattern recognition.
That's your snake oil.

639
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,958
Well, not everybody
understands the patterns.

640
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:06,708
And that gave me a little bit more of
an uptake, but it's just a parlor trick.

641
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,416
So then, I went on
to door number three.

642
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:11,833
Are you really implying that you have
some sort of ultimate formula?

643
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:15,166
Well, from 12,000 to
2.3 million in ten days.

644
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:18,708
- I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.
- Delusions of grandeur.

645
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:23,875
I don't have delusions of grandeur,
I have an actual recipe for grandeur.

646
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:25,958


647
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,083
I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what
you game is, but I'm sure of one thing.

648
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:30,541
You don't work in my world.

649
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:34,041
I'm up to my ass with investment guys
and you don't have their half-terrified,

650
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:36,166
half-cocky line of crap which is...

651
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,958
not to say that
I like yours any better.

652
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:42,000
But you obviously pick your stocks
in a way which I haven't seen before.

653
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:46,000
Take a look at these companies
and tell me what you think.

654
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:49,333
- Right now?
- Yeah. Take your time.

655
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:50,916


656
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:53,208
Sure.

657
00:40:53,250 --> 00:41:05,166


658
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:08,708
These companies aren't
the question, are they?

659
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,291


660
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,541
Explain.

661
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:14,166
Unless you're playing
both sides of the fence.

662
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:16,041
Control the whole power enchilada,
but, no,

663
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:18,625
these companies wouldn't get you there
in emerging markets.

664
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,750
You would have to...

665
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:25,375
This must be some big-ass merger
you're contemplating.

666
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,625


667
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:28,458
And there's really only one company
with enough bling

668
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:31,416
to justify a merger
with Van Loon and Associates.

669
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,541
Who have you been talking to?

670
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:37,250
Oh, I'm just connecting the dots.
Is Hank Atwood really gonna go for it?

671
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:40,875
Well, you're an amazing con artist,
or you're a very smart young man.

672
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,666
I mean, come on.
The two of you together?

673
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:45,291
The whole world would have
to come begging for energy

674
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:47,375
like Oliver Twist
and his bowl of gruel.

675
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,000
Now you're going backwards.
What else you got?

676
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:54,333
- A prediction. It won't come off.
- Why's that?

677
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:58,666
- You'd have to back off Libya.
- Really?

678
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,333
Well, you don't want to hear this from
some schmuck who needs a ride home.

679
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:06,083
All right, you get your shot. Meet me
tomorrow at the Saint Regis at ten

680
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:08,416
and tell me how the gutsy little schmuck
who needs a ride home

681
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:11,708
would re-structure these deals.
And you'd better be prepared.

682
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,333
I'm at your disposal.

683
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:15,375
You don't really live here,
do you?

684
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,291
Well... Spartans weren't
big on amenities.

685
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:21,958
Yeah, and they eventually
got their asses kicked.

686
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,958


687
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,583
I didn't go in. I wanted
to walk, move, digest, ingest.

688
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:36,958
There are moments in life... moments
when you know you've crossed a bridge.

689
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,375
Your old life is oven.

690
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,333
Van Loon was my bridge.
I finally had my shot.

691
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,916
Wall Street would provide my nest egg,
but then how far could I go?

692
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:48,708
CEO? A global force?
Maybe President.

693
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,916
Time somebody shook up the free world
and got things done.

694
00:42:51,958 --> 00:43:03,625


695
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:06,250
Suddenly...

696
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:07,208


697
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:12,875
It was another skip.
How had I gone the last 20 blocks?

698
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:14,208


699
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:19,375
I got another ten blocks.
And then...

700
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:20,833


701
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:23,833
I was way uptown.

702
00:43:23,875 --> 00:44:06,208


703
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,416
What bar was this?

704
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:21,166


705
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:25,541
Black canvas and then they would
just drop all the paint...

706
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:26,791


707
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:30,083
Yeah. Did you ever meet...

708
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:32,916
and then I actually went
there and had lunch, I went back.

709
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:34,916
My friends are rolling...

710
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:36,291


711
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:39,083
I heard you like to party.

712
00:44:39,125 --> 00:45:02,291


713
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,541
- Hey, watch it.
- Take it easy!

714
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:07,666
A fight? Don't know how to fight.

715
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:10,125
Or do I?

716
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:18,875


717
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:22,500
You use the fishhook action
to get inside the mouth.

718
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:25,875
Like this.

719
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:33,750


720
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:38,541
Attack the sensitive areas.
The eyes, the throat, the groin.

721
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:42,291


722
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:45,333
If you are hit, do not stop.

723
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:48,875
Your persistence will
discourage your attacker.

724
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:49,708


725
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,833
Balancing your opponent

726
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:54,666
and then using his momentum,
take him down.

727
00:45:54,708 --> 00:46:24,791


728
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:27,125
When it finally stopped,

729
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:31,625
I couldn't account
for the last 18 hours of my life.

730
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:52,833


731
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:55,500
Hey, it's me.
I thought you were coming oven

732
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:59,500
Is everything OK?
Call me when you get this.

733
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:37,916


734
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:43,583
Even of? NZT, I decided
to give Van Loon's files a shot.

735
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:49,791


736
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:53,000
They were hieroglyphs.

737
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:55,458


738
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,041
- Hello?
- Kevin, this is Eddie.

739
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,166
- Eddie?
- Listen,

740
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:03,041
- I can't make the meeting today.
- What are you talking about?

741
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:03,500


742
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:04,875
I can't come in today, I'm sick.

743
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,208
Yeah, well you can't
have the flu right now.

744
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,541
He'll never give you
this chance again.

745
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:14,208
I know, listen, I just...
I have all this data to analyze...

746
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:17,958
What have you been doing
for the last day?

747
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,500


748
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:22,041
- Kev, I...
- Don't you get it? This is your test.

749
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:25,041
Yeah, well, I can't
pass the test right now.

750
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:27,291
And how am I gonna look
if you don't?

751
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:30,041
- I know, listen, I just...
- Listen to me.

752
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:33,791
Pull yourself together.
Get down to the meeting.

753
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:39,416


754
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:43,833
OK, OK.
I'll be there. I'll be there.

755
00:48:43,875 --> 00:49:04,416


756
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:06,666
- Hey, how are ya?
- Eddie.

757
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:09,333
Good to see you again.

758
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,875
Sit down.

759
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:14,916


760
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:17,041
What do you know
about Hank Atwood?

761
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:19,291
Atwood...

762
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:19,750


763
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:23,208
He's an iconoclast...

764
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,458


765
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,208
Owns about half of Colorado.

766
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:28,875


767
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:31,333
So this is prepared, Eddie?

768
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:32,625


769
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:35,791
Is this Atwood 101?
Doesn't everybody know about Atwood?

770
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:38,375
Where was he two years ago?

771
00:49:38,416 --> 00:49:39,958


772
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,708
Nowhere.

773
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,625


774
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:48,500
Two years ago he wasn't
even on Forbes' radar.

775
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:48,958


776
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,250
That was a great leap
forward, right?

777
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:56,083
I'm baffled by this guy.
He comes out of nowhere so strong.

778
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:59,125
Has me on the run before I can
even get to anybody in his camp.

779
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,875
Beats me out of two properties,

780
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,416
investing in countries with no oil.
Places I'd never go near...

781
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:10,916


782
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:13,208
We're here in front
of the hotel where a woman,

783
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:17,041
identified as Maria Winberg,
was found dead in her room last night,

784
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:22,750
a victim of foul play. Ms. Winberg
was a well-known socialite and model...

785
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:23,291


786
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:27,541
but was also known for her dedicated
charity work around the city.

787
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:30,833
Police spent hours questioning
hotel staff and patrons

788
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:34,083
and an eyewitness reported
seeing a man leaving the scene...

789
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:37,875
help me convince him that I can
raise his game. Got any ideas?

790
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,625
What do you think?

791
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:43,041


792
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:46,375
...hotel has adequate
security cameras...

793
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:49,750


794
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:52,625
You're not one of those
kind of guys, are you Eddie?

795
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,666
We lose you if there's
a screen in the room?

796
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:57,000


797
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:59,708
These are tectonic plates
that are shifting right under us.

798
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:02,333
Pardon me, one second.

799
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:23,625


800
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:28,083
Was it possible?
Could I have killed someone?

801
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:29,250


802
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:32,250
Was it even me?

803
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:36,041


804
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,666
Eddie? This is Melissa.

805
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:40,916
Listen, Vernon hasn't been
giving you anything, has he?

806
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:42,625
Because that stuff is dangerous.

807
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:44,166
Melissa?

808
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:46,583
Melissa, hey, do you think
that we can meet somewhere?

809
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:49,375
- I really need to talk to you.
- We're talking now.

810
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,750
No, no, let's meet at...
Billy's on Grant at noon?

811
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:55,166
- You can't see me, Eddie.
- No, no...

812
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:58,375
- Eddie, please.
- Please, please come, please come, I...

813
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,375
It's important, I really need to know
what you're talking about.

814
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:04,125


815
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:07,333
I realized that there were
other people who might know about NZT.

816
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,708
Vernon's other clients.

817
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:49,541


818
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,541
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi,

819
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:52,041
may I please speak
with Jerry Brady?

820
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:54,541
- Jerry's in the hospital.
- He's what?

821
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:56,458
Yeah, he's not doing well at all.

822
00:52:56,583 --> 00:53:01,375
- Yeah, hello, is Paul Kaplan there?
- No. No, he's not.

823
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,625
Paul passed away three days ago.

824
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,625
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

825
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,291
Yeah, he started getting headaches,
then he collapsed at work.

826
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:11,791
Now he's in the ICU.

827
00:53:11,916 --> 00:53:14,083
OK, please give him my best.
Thank you.

828
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:20,416
Of all the people I called...
three were dead and the rest were sick.

829
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:42,458


830
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:48,000
Hello? Hello?

831
00:53:48,041 --> 00:54:05,250


832
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:07,166
Watch it, man!

833
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:23,541


834
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:25,500
Did you see that?

835
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:33,000


836
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:37,333
Go! Go!

837
00:54:37,375 --> 00:55:03,250


838
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:05,416
Eddie.

839
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:06,625


840
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:09,333
Melissa.

841
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:15,666


842
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:17,833
Hey.

843
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:20,875


844
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:25,041
Don't tell me I look good,
'cause I know.

845
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,125


846
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:28,666
I didn't want you
to see me this way.

847
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,583
You look good.

848
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:33,375
Oh, I...

849
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,500
Yeah, I sorta got myself together.

850
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:38,041
NZT will do that to you.

851
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:41,916
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I took it, too.

852
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:44,750
Vernon didn't tell you
any of this, did he?

853
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:45,916
No.

854
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:47,708
Well, when he told me
about this amazing new drug,

855
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:51,750
I was like, down the hatch.
And it was. It was amazing.

856
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:55,500
I read Brian Greene's
The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes

857
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:57,416
and I understood it.

858
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:59,791
My work rate increased
just insanely overnight

859
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:02,458
and my boss started to hate me.

860
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,375


861
00:56:03,416 --> 00:56:09,083
They offered me his job and then...
and then I got scared.

862
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:11,416
- Why?
- Why? Because I'm not stupid.

863
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:15,666
Nobody can operate at that level
of mental activity and not crash.

864
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:17,625


865
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,458
I stopped taking it.

866
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:23,875
- And?
- And I got sick. Headaches.

867
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,291
Throwing up.
So I went back to Vernon.

868
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:32,750
He told me about all the people
that were dying.

869
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:33,166


870
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:35,125
How much have you
been taking, Eddie?

871
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,750
I've been taking a lot.

872
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:38,458


873
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:43,666
Well, maybe... maybe they've
worked out the bugs. Maybe...

874
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:46,208
Maybe this is a different batch.

875
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:46,750


876
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:49,583
- Yeah.
- You're off it right now, aren't you?

877
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:52,166
- Just finish your story.
- Well...

878
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:56,000
I didn't take any more
and I didn't die.

879
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:56,458


880
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,541
But after a while, I realized I
couldn't concentrate on anything

881
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,791
for longer than ten minutes.

882
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:06,583
I... I missed deadlines,
got lazy, slow, so slow.

883
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:10,041
That was two years ago.

884
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:11,083


885
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:14,000
And I haven't been the same since.

886
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:17,833


887
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:21,708
Do you have some left?
Good.

888
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:25,166
You go home and you take it. You take
the dose down, but you don't just stop.

889
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:27,541
You'll die if you just stop.

890
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:33,333
Try to taper off, otherwise
the headaches are just the beginning.

891
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,625


892
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:36,875
I have to go.

893
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:37,875


894
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:41,333
- Do you know who makes it?
- I don't know.

895
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,000


896
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,375
I have to go.

897
00:57:44,416 --> 00:58:14,125


898
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:18,916
Oh, shit. Listen, listen, listen.
Listen, listen, listen... OK.

899
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:20,708
- You forget about me?
- No, no, no, no.

900
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:22,750
12:00 and you're not here.

901
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:26,416
- I'm here now.
- Good.

902
00:58:26,541 --> 00:58:29,125
- Come on, get going.
- I could write you a check.

903
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:34,166
Check. Check.
Are you out of your mind?

904
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:36,541
What do you think I am?
Some financial institution?

905
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:39,583
All right. You're right.
Look, we just need to go to a bank...

906
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:43,250


907
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:46,541
What do you got there?

908
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:49,916


909
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:52,333
- What is it?
- No, it's just aspirin.

910
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:58,791
Don't look like no aspirin I ever see.
It's something good?

911
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:16,666


912
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:20,791
I feel good, man.
What's in this stuff?

913
00:59:20,916 --> 00:59:23,666
It's just vitamins and aspirin.

914
00:59:23,791 --> 00:59:28,333
You full of shit, Eddie baby.

915
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:52,958


916
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,958
Lindy. I wouldn't
have let him in, but...

917
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:59,666
I'm sorry...
Tyler, I gotta go.

918
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,500
I'm sick.

919
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:03,166


920
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:07,000
I shouldn't... I'm sorry.
I couldn't make it home.

921
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:10,166
- Let's get you to a hospital.
- No, no, no, no, no. I don't need...

922
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:11,333
I need you to get...

923
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:15,375
It's really simple, babe.
I need my pills.

924
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,041
- Eddie, what pills?
- I don't... Babe, it's complicated.

925
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:20,875
What are you taking?
Are you on drugs?

926
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,916
They're... It's...

927
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:28,166
I had no choice.
I told Lindy everything.

928
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,000


929
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:33,375
So all this energy of yours,
all this focus...

930
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,791
has been a drug.

931
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:37,208
Well, it was supposed to be legal.

932
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:41,791
I have a... a supply stashed.

933
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:42,666


934
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:44,416
You want me to go get it.

935
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:47,958
- No. No, no, no. I'm gonna go get it.
- Give me your keys.

936
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:49,666
I'll go to your apartment.

937
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:53,666
It's not... in my apartment.
I moved it.

938
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:58,416
OK, so where did you move it?

939
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:04,291


940
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:07,083
In my house.

941
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,041


942
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:10,333
Unbelievable.

943
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:21,708


944
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:24,458
Hey, have you got it?

945
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:26,958
Yeah.

946
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,166


947
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:30,583
There's someone following me.

948
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:31,250


949
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:32,500
Are you sure?

950
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:35,000
Yeah.
He got into the cab behind me

951
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,125
and he's making every turn
I'm making.

952
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:41,000
- Baby, call the cops.
- Can you go around him?

953
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:42,375
Babe, what's happening?

954
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,125
We're stopped dead.

955
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:45,541


956
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:47,916
He's getting out.

957
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:50,583
Eddie, he's walking over here.

958
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:52,458
Lindy?

959
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,458
Oh, God!

960
01:01:54,500 --> 01:02:08,708


961
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:12,583
Help! Help!

962
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:13,291


963
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:15,875
This man's...
This man's chasing me!

964
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,500
He followed me from
my building. I don't know him.

965
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:23,833
- Please!
- Yo, buddy, let's leave her alone!

966
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:25,458


967
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,500
Are you deaf?
I said leave her alone.

968
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:29,750


969
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,708
Hey, buddy, are you
trying to piss me off?

970
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:33,625


971
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,750
What are you doing, man?

972
01:02:36,791 --> 01:03:07,375


973
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,291
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm here. What happened?

974
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:13,541
I'm stuck. He'll find me.

975
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:15,625
OK, stop talking. Don't move.

976
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,333
- He killed two guys.
- What?

977
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:21,625
- He's gonna kill me, too.
- No, no, no...

978
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,750
Can he see you?

979
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:26,541


980
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:28,958
No.

981
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:31,541
Not yet.

982
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,041


983
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,583
I don't know what to do.

984
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:39,125
OK, I need you to go into the bag
and take one of the pills.

985
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,458
Why?

986
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,000
Because you'll know what to do.
You'll take it and then you'll know.

987
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:47,833
He's got a knife. Eddie, I can't
think my way out of a knife.

988
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:50,250
Just listen to me.
It'll come on in 30 seconds.

989
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:53,125
And you'll think your way out.
That's what it does.

990
01:03:53,166 --> 01:04:15,708


991
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:20,166
He's getting closer.

992
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:21,916


993
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,291
Lindy, I love you.

994
01:04:24,333 --> 01:05:34,666


995
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:37,125
Now turn to me...

996
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:41,583


997
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:45,041
Daddy!

998
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:54,500


999
01:05:54,541 --> 01:05:56,958
Eddie. Here.

1000
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,166
It's gonna be OK.

1001
01:06:00,208 --> 01:06:01,583


1002
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:05,916
We've got to get out of here.
Eddie?

1003
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:39,166


1004
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:41,416
You OK?

1005
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:42,000


1006
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:44,666
Yeah.

1007
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:45,666


1008
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:48,958
I'm so sorry about what happened.

1009
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:52,166
I want you to know that you never,
ever have to go through that again,

1010
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:55,000
'cause I can take care of us now.

1011
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:57,125
I'm sure you can.

1012
01:06:57,250 --> 01:07:00,583
I can make us safe.
I'm back, OK?

1013
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:04,000


1014
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:06,291
- Who's back, Eddie?
- Me.

1015
01:07:06,416 --> 01:07:08,791
No. It's not you.

1016
01:07:08,916 --> 01:07:12,458
- You were different before.
- I'm still the same person, Lin.

1017
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:15,041
I wasn't, when I was on it.

1018
01:07:15,416 --> 01:07:17,500
I did things I would never do.

1019
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:20,166
- Those things saved your life.
- But they weren't me.

1020
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:21,791
Yes, they were.
No, the way it works...

1021
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:24,333
I know how it works. I get it.

1022
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:28,083
I totally get it.
You feel invincible.

1023
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,125
Where it will take us, Lin,
you can't even imagine.

1024
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:35,625
The things we'll be able to do.
Where we'll be a year from now.

1025
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:39,375
The kind of life that
we'll finally be able to live.

1026
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:43,541
Well, you might have
to live it without me.

1027
01:07:43,583 --> 01:07:46,708


1028
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,333
Look, I am gonna stop taking it.
There's just some things I have to do

1029
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:52,958
to keep us safe and that... to set us up
and then I'm gonna get off it.

1030
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:54,625
- I mean, that's the plan.
- Eddie...

1031
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:57,000
Look, I have a plan.
I swear.

1032
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:59,791
I'm gonna get off it.

1033
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:00,333


1034
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,541
OK.

1035
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:03,625


1036
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:06,083
I hope you do.

1037
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:37,375


1038
01:08:37,416 --> 01:08:40,125
Looking for me?

1039
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:41,625


1040
01:08:41,666 --> 01:08:45,291
You think you can run out on me?
You think I don't know where you are?

1041
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:47,125
I was under the impression
our business was settled.

1042
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:49,000
I want some more of that stuff.

1043
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,041
Or I shoot you right here.
Take your pick.

1044
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:53,916
This guy was not going away.

1045
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:55,750
A few pills
would buy me some time.

1046
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:59,208
- There it is. We're done.
- Oh, yeah. We'll see.

1047
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:02,458
Until I found a more...
permanent solution.

1048
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:06,416
Unless you see a real threat, I never
want it known that I have any security.

1049
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:08,708
You'll never precede me,
you'll always follow me.

1050
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:12,250
Never more than 15 steps behind.
And never stand too close together.

1051
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:15,916
I want to able to look behind me
if the opportunity presents itself.

1052
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:16,458


1053
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,625
And don't wear the same color suit.
This isn't The Matrix.

1054
01:09:19,666 --> 01:09:24,458


1055
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,625
You have to know, Eddie,
I wrote you off.

1056
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,333
- I was sick.
- You don't get sick.

1057
01:09:28,458 --> 01:09:31,125
You're playing at this level, you get
hit by a car, you don't even die.

1058
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,875
- You're absolutely right.
- I know I'm right.

1059
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,833
I mean, I didn't know who or what
I was talking to.

1060
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:40,041
A hundred and five. That's who
you were talking to, Carl. Delirium.

1061
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:41,833


1062
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,000
I sent over
my revised projections.

1063
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:45,083
I didn't ask for your projections.

1064
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:47,875
I know, but I think if
you take a look at them...

1065
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,666
I already have.
As a matter of fact...

1066
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:51,375


1067
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:54,541
I fired a few people
over your projections.

1068
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:56,250
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

1069
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:59,125
You're relieved that you know things
my team missed.

1070
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:04,625
The minute,
the instant that's no longer true...

1071
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:06,666


1072
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:08,250
Two months after I'd started NZT,

1073
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:11,458
I was brokering the biggest merger
in corporate history.

1074
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:15,958
Ironically, it's gonna be crude. Crude
is gonna be where we're gonna hit them.

1075
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:18,625
Which yields a prospective profit
of 200 percent.

1076
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,583
That makes both of us
very happy campers.

1077
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:23,041
I found that if
I maintained an even dose,

1078
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:25,458
remembered to eat,
drank no alcohol,

1079
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:28,833
- the blackouts didn't recur.
- How you doing, Eddie?

1080
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:31,875
Tom, is it possible to construct
an imperceptible compartment?

1081
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,416
In this jacket?

1082
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:36,916
- In all of them.
- Certainly, sir.

1083
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:41,125
Safer though my stash now was, I
was not sitting around until it ran out.

1084
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:44,500
Can I combine these ingredients
in the same exact quantity, yes, but,

1085
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:49,375
the exact method of delivery
to the brain... Darts at a dartboard.

1086
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,083
- Meaning?
- Clinical trials, guinea pig people.

1087
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,666
- That's gonna take too long.
- It's what it is.

1088
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:58,250
Or you'll kill people.
You need 12, to 18 months...

1089
01:10:58,375 --> 01:11:01,333
I'll give you two million dollars
if you can do it in six.

1090
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:09,000


1091
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:13,791
I found that we can cut costs
30 percent and...

1092
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:16,333


1093
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,541
Excuse me one second.

1094
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:21,208


1095
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,375
I thought we straightened this out,
Detective.

1096
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:27,375
This isn't about Vernon Gant,
Mr. Morra.

1097
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,833
What is this about?

1098
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:36,125
The witness identified the Maria Winberg
suspect as this person.

1099
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:39,916


1100
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:43,708
Wanna tell me your whereabouts
the night of April 2nd?

1101
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:44,791


1102
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,875
I couldn't keep
this quiet on my own.

1103
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:53,583
Enter Morris Brandt...
the most lethal lawyer in New York.

1104
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:55,708


1105
01:11:55,750 --> 01:12:00,333
You're lucky somebody wiped the room.
It's weak. Circumstantial at best.

1106
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:03,458
Just between us, were you there?

1107
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,625
I don't remember.

1108
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:06,291


1109
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:07,875
I don't want to
make concessions to you...

1110
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood

1111
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:14,083
had no idea I might
soon be charged with murder.

1112
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:16,833
But SyCorps, Andine
and others are jockeying

1113
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,958
for the same industrial
concessions in Libya

1114
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:21,291
that both our companies are
pretending we're not sniffing out.

1115
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:23,625
How do you know this?

1116
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:26,375
The governmental bribe system
is itself corrupt, so, of course,

1117
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:30,458
information about its inner workings,
like anything, can be bought.

1118
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,166


1119
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:33,541
Go on.

1120
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:37,000
If you take a look at the lower
left-hand column, in 2008,

1121
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:41,416
five companies were jockeying for a
position before we even took notice.

1122
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:43,875


1123
01:12:43,916 --> 01:12:46,458
Jesus, he looks frail.

1124
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:49,875
- Could be an act.
- He's not even 60.

1125
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:51,333


1126
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:54,375
So, have you decided, Eddie?
What are you gonna do?

1127
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,541
When this is over?
I don't know.

1128
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:59,000
You haven't given me the answer.

1129
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,958
You haven't asked the question.

1130
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:02,791
Well, given the scale
of my contribution,

1131
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:05,166
let's say 45.

1132
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:08,250
Done.
Forty-five thousand dollars.

1133
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:11,750
Forty million is plenty, Eddie.
There's a lot more where that came from.

1134
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:14,125
You know, Eddie...

1135
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,291
it may be on your mind

1136
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:17,750
that you're not gonna
continue to work for me anymore.

1137
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:19,541
This has been
the learning experience of my life.

1138
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:22,125
I hope it has. I hope you don't
think you've gotten enough from me.

1139
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:23,708
On to the next.

1140
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:26,541
Well, in order for a career to evolve,
I'm gonna have to move on.

1141
01:13:26,666 --> 01:13:29,125
That you would even think that
would only show me

1142
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:31,625
how unprepared you are
to be on your own.

1143
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,041
I mean, you do know
you're a freak.

1144
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:36,625
Your deductive powers are a gift
from God, or chance,

1145
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:39,041
or a stray shot of sperm,
or whatever, or whoever the hell wrote

1146
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:41,416
your life script,
a gift not earned.

1147
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:45,375
You do not know what I know because
you have not earned those powers.

1148
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,166
You're careless with those powers.

1149
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:50,541
You flaunt them and you throw them
around like a brat with his trust fund.

1150
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:53,583
You haven't had to climb up
all the greasy little rungs.

1151
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:56,625
You haven't been bored blind at the
fundraisers. You haven't done the time

1152
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,541
in that first marriage
to the girl with the right father.

1153
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:01,333
You think you can leap
over all in a single bound.

1154
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:03,958
You haven't had to bribe
or charm or threaten your way

1155
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:07,208
to a seat at that table. You don't
know how to assess your competition

1156
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:11,416
because you haven't competed.
Don't make me your competition.

1157
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:13,333


1158
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,375
Now, I'll open up
a line of credit for you.

1159
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,416
You'll be wanting a few toys.

1160
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:35,208


1161
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:37,833
Hotel rooms
were no longer an option.

1162
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:39,958
What I needed was a bunker.

1163
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:42,458
There's a built-in safe,
central surveillance,

1164
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:45,083
vault grade pneumatic doors.

1165
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:48,458
It's an unparalleled
three-tier security system.

1166
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:52,791
A fortress with a hell of a view.

1167
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:56,166


1168
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:59,791
- What's the asking price?
- Eight-point-five.

1169
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:03,916


1170
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:06,166
I'll take it.

1171
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:10,916


1172
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:13,791
Right away, it was obvious
he was on NZT.

1173
01:15:13,916 --> 01:15:16,500
Next week,
I'm gonna need 20 pills.

1174
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:18,541
Next week,
you can go fuck yourself!

1175
01:15:18,666 --> 01:15:21,083
Not that you'd feel anything.

1176
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,833
I don't think your Fortune 500
financial friends would appreciate

1177
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:28,916
the details of your little dilemma
with the police.

1178
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:32,625
Thursday,
I'm gonna need the pills here.

1179
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:34,791


1180
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:37,125
Getting smarter!

1181
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:38,083


1182
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:40,125
Obviously, this could not go on,

1183
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:43,333
but there is very little on this earth
that 40 million dollars can't solve.

1184
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:47,916
And tomorrow at nine,
Atwood would sign the papers.

1185
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:54,375


1186
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:57,375
- Do you want to call it?
- Cold feet?

1187
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:00,916
There was all last night
to tell us that.

1188
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:01,583


1189
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:04,833
- Anything?
- I'll call him again, sir.

1190
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:07,125
OK, the decision could have changed.
That makes sense.

1191
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:10,958
The discourtesy doesn't.
It's still on.

1192
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:11,375


1193
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:14,458
Oh, based on your charts
and projections.

1194
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,750
You know, remind me,
who the fuck are you, anyway?

1195
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:19,541
I'm sorry, Carl, I've had it with this
unqualified, posturing little prick.

1196
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:21,750
- Pull it back.
- Since when is this the Delphic Oracle?

1197
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:25,666
- Pull it back.
- Excuse me, Mr. Van Loon?

1198
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:28,125
Mrs. Atwood is in your office.

1199
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:30,125


1200
01:16:30,166 --> 01:16:32,541
Mrs. Atwood, Carl Van Loon.

1201
01:16:32,666 --> 01:16:35,958
- My associate, Edward Morra.
- Pleasure.

1202
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,500


1203
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:40,083
I wanted to make this
as confidential as possible.

1204
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:41,750
Of course.

1205
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:45,750
My husband experienced some pain
and dizziness this morning.

1206
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:48,833
He's currently at Lenox Hill,
undergoing tests.

1207
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:49,583


1208
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:51,541
I just want you to know
we have every intention

1209
01:16:51,666 --> 01:16:53,791
of signing the contract.

1210
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:58,250
And as soon as he is able,
we will proceed.

1211
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:01,458
I realize this is a useless platitude,
but if there's anything that we can do,

1212
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:02,875
please don't hesitate to tell us.

1213
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,791
Obviously, we want to be
as helpful and respectful

1214
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:06,416
as possible, Mrs. Atwood.

1215
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:10,166
Thank you, gentlemen.
I rely on your discretion.

1216
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,333


1217
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:12,375
There won't be a proxy.

1218
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:16,375
No, a cagey prick like him
giving away power of attorney?

1219
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:19,958


1220
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,833
Well, he'd better get better.

1221
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:25,083


1222
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:30,375
But Atwood wouldn't get better.
Because Atwood was out of NZT.

1223
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:33,000


1224
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:36,541
Well, why be surprised?

1225
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:40,041
How many other meteoric rises
might be explained by NZT?

1226
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:41,541
At least I had some.

1227
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:43,750
- My life wasn't in jeopardy.
- You can wait here.

1228
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:47,708
Only my money.
And my liberty.

1229
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:48,250


1230
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:49,625
I've been all over with them.

1231
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:52,083
We can't allow
any disparity in race

1232
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:54,916
or physical type between you
and the rest of the line up.

1233
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:55,958
OK.

1234
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:58,416
They're as close to your clones
as I could possibly get.

1235
01:17:58,541 --> 01:18:03,125
It's gotta be just one big
handsome blur to this guy.

1236
01:18:03,166 --> 01:18:16,000


1237
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:18,791
Who was out there?

1238
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:19,666


1239
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:22,250
The woman's husband?

1240
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:25,125
A hotel maid?

1241
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:26,208


1242
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:29,583
Was this how it was
all going to end?

1243
01:18:29,625 --> 01:18:33,041


1244
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,583
Not the dimmest clue.
He was dithering.

1245
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:38,583
"He was the third one from the right.
No. Not him."

1246
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:44,083
There you go. It's a thing of beauty.
You have that made?

1247
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:46,666
I did.

1248
01:18:46,708 --> 01:19:02,583


1249
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:04,416
...market's been mixed today.

1250
01:19:04,541 --> 01:19:07,208
The Dow has been yo-yoing
amidst speculation that.

1251
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:12,916
Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood
have negotiated a merger...

1252
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:15,750
Have you been talking to anyone?

1253
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:16,291


1254
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:19,083
No, I haven't been talking to anybody,
Carl. I'm not stupid.

1255
01:19:19,208 --> 01:19:20,416
I know you're not stupid, Eddie,

1256
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:22,416
but don't make the classic
smart person's mistake.

1257
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:24,375
Thinking no one's smarter than you.

1258
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,583
Where the hell have you been? This is
the second time you've turned to vapor.

1259
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:30,541
I was in the building, I was getting coffee.
Why, has there been movement?

1260
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:32,916
Yeah, there's been movement alright.
Atwood's in a coma.

1261
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:35,541
He wasn't playing us.
He's dying.

1262
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:37,208
What do you know about this?

1263
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:40,875
I was less than
usually equipped to answer.

1264
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,291
The dullness was coming on.
I was overdue to take my NZT.

1265
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:48,583
And the pain was
starting behind my eyes.

1266
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:49,916
Excuse me.

1267
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:51,500
You're not excused.

1268
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:55,000
What? A man in your employ
can't take a piss, Carl?

1269
01:19:55,041 --> 01:20:16,791


1270
01:20:16,833 --> 01:20:18,666
Was it Brandt or someone else?

1271
01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:22,208
The police station? A coatroom?

1272
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:35,333


1273
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:36,583
Mr. Morra.

1274
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:39,166
- Carl, I'm sorry...
- Mr. Morra. Mr. Morra!

1275
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:41,916
- This just came for you.
- Yeah, what?

1276
01:20:41,958 --> 01:20:45,583


1277
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:49,500
Hope not, so let me know
when you know.

1278
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:52,333
All right, I'm gonna ask you again, Eddie.
What do you know about this?

1279
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:55,625
- What? About the leak?
- No. About Atwood.

1280
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:57,083
What? What about Atwood?

1281
01:20:57,208 --> 01:20:59,416
Look, you got a long way to go
as a liar, kiddo.

1282
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:00,750
- Carl, I don't know what you're...
- Listen!

1283
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:02,208
What you're about to say is bullshit.

1284
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:03,750
I know there's something
you're hiding from me.

1285
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:05,750
I smell it on you. Right now,

1286
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:10,083
I wanna know why this clusterfuck
of a deal is dead in the water!

1287
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:10,875


1288
01:21:10,916 --> 01:21:12,916
Carl.

1289
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:15,875
Eddie! Eddie!

1290
01:21:15,916 --> 01:21:31,541


1291
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:33,458
Outside Lenox Hill
Hospital today,

1292
01:21:33,583 --> 01:21:36,291
more twists and tums
in the Van Loon-Atwood merger.

1293
01:21:36,416 --> 01:21:40,208
There is absolutely no truth
to the rumor of this merger.

1294
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:43,958
None whatsoever.
My husband is having tests.

1295
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,166
This is a difficult time.

1296
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:50,125
We would appreciate your directing
further questions to our attorney.

1297
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,666
Yes, we have no further comments
at this time.

1298
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:55,125
We're just awaiting the results
of the latest round of tests

1299
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,208
and hoping for the best.

1300
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:58,583
Thank you.

1301
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:36,708


1302
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:42,083
Eddie.
I know you're in there, Eddie.

1303
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:42,500


1304
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:46,250
Open up.

1305
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:47,625


1306
01:22:47,666 --> 01:22:50,541
Come on.

1307
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:51,958


1308
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,708
Open the door.

1309
01:22:54,750 --> 01:23:10,500


1310
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:14,125
And so, here I am.

1311
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:16,041


1312
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:18,708
I knew they would kill me
slowly and horribly.

1313
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:22,791
But this choice
would at least be mine.

1314
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:31,333


1315
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:35,666
But we're instinctive creatures.
We want to live.

1316
01:23:35,791 --> 01:23:41,125
So my foggy brain tried to remember
where one tablet of NZT might be.

1317
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:47,500


1318
01:23:47,541 --> 01:23:53,166
It was possible.
And possible was enough.

1319
01:23:53,208 --> 01:24:15,625


1320
01:24:15,666 --> 01:24:18,083
Hey, Eddie.

1321
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:40,000


1322
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:43,833
Now you know I want more,
so why would you upset me?

1323
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:44,291


1324
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:46,875
I don't like being down
to this last one.

1325
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,875
You don't even know
how to use it.

1326
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,291
You don't appreciate it.

1327
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:54,458
You see, I dissolve in a solution.

1328
01:24:54,583 --> 01:25:00,083
You shoot it. It goes straight
into the blood and brain.

1329
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:00,833


1330
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:03,875
Lasts much longer.

1331
01:25:03,916 --> 01:25:17,833


1332
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:19,416
So...

1333
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:22,083
You gonna tell me
where the rest is?

1334
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:24,708
I'm plumb out.

1335
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:28,500


1336
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:32,083
You know,
these guys are gonna find it.

1337
01:25:32,416 --> 01:25:34,916
Or I'm gonna make you tell me.

1338
01:25:35,041 --> 01:25:38,833
Question is,
which is gonna come first?

1339
01:25:38,958 --> 01:25:41,875
I guess we're gonna find out?

1340
01:25:41,916 --> 01:25:44,708


1341
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:48,000
This is a waste of my time,
you know?

1342
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:51,000
I'm getting out
of this side of the business.

1343
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:56,583
I'm branching out.
I'm starting import-export company.

1344
01:25:56,708 --> 01:25:57,791
Very exciting stuff.

1345
01:25:57,916 --> 01:26:02,375
I got a lot on my plate.
You're lucky I'm here.

1346
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:09,416


1347
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:15,000
Back in the old times, I might
peel your skin back. Fillet you.

1348
01:26:15,125 --> 01:26:17,833
"Fillet." It's a nice word.

1349
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:23,500
I didn't know this before.
Oh, I had such a poor vocabulary.

1350
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:27,166


1351
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:30,291
But then I discovered
this thing, Google.

1352
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:34,000
Did you know the small and large
intestines is 20 foot long?

1353
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:35,875
I had no idea.
I don't believe it.

1354
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,791
I gotta see this for myself.
I'm dubious. It's another nice word.

1355
01:26:39,916 --> 01:26:44,208
Anyway,
I'm sure you're curious, too.

1356
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:46,791
Don't worry,
everything's sterilized.

1357
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:49,916
We're gonna keep you alive
for the whole shebang.

1358
01:26:50,041 --> 01:26:53,041
You're gonna get
a front row seat, Eddie.

1359
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:54,625


1360
01:26:54,666 --> 01:26:57,375
What?

1361
01:26:57,416 --> 01:27:29,541


1362
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:31,708
Not much of a triumph, was it?

1363
01:27:31,833 --> 01:27:34,875
Because I would die here, too.

1364
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,125


1365
01:27:36,166 --> 01:27:41,291
Only NZT could help me and the last of
it was in this fuck's blood stream.

1366
01:27:41,333 --> 01:28:56,041


1367
01:28:56,083 --> 01:28:58,166
Victor!

1368
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:05,041


1369
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:07,541
What?

1370
01:29:07,583 --> 01:30:16,291


1371
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:18,166
Victor?

1372
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:20,583


1373
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:22,666
Victor?

1374
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,166
Victor?

1375
01:30:25,208 --> 01:31:13,833


1376
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:15,375
The police would later note

1377
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:18,041
that my apartment's previous
owner was an arms dealer.

1378
01:31:18,166 --> 01:31:23,291
Of course, these intruders had
been his dissatisfied clients.

1379
01:31:23,416 --> 01:31:26,875
And the night was still young.

1380
01:31:26,916 --> 01:31:38,458


1381
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,583
I'm sure you're curious
about what happened to your boss.

1382
01:31:40,708 --> 01:31:42,791
I know I certainly am.

1383
01:31:42,916 --> 01:31:45,708
I mean, if my attorney was
really working for Mr. Atwood,

1384
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:50,041
trying to save his life,
why is he dead?

1385
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:52,708
I mean, at what point was
the pony express supposed to ride in

1386
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:55,791
with his life-saving medication?

1387
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,958
His boss was dead.

1388
01:31:58,083 --> 01:32:02,166
So, I didn't matter now.

1389
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:07,833
But he did not appreciate that Morris
Brandt had kept the pills for himself.

1390
01:32:07,875 --> 01:32:18,916


1391
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:22,125
And it was all still possible.

1392
01:32:22,166 --> 01:32:39,666


1393
01:32:39,708 --> 01:32:42,208
Actually, no,
there's no more tickets.

1394
01:32:42,333 --> 01:32:46,708
Yeah, I know. An overbooked
fundraiser. That's a first.

1395
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:49,125
Well, here he comes.
I'll ask him.

1396
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:50,666
Oh, that's much better.

1397
01:32:50,791 --> 01:32:53,250
- Great job.
- Thank you, sir.

1398
01:32:53,375 --> 01:32:54,500
Hi, Mr. Morra.

1399
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:57,291
Edward!

1400
01:32:57,333 --> 01:32:57,791


1401
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:00,041
I think we're looking
at a second overflow event.

1402
01:33:00,166 --> 01:33:02,083
There's a wave of donations coming in
and I don't think

1403
01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:04,500
they're even gonna
try a second debate.

1404
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:05,833
- Great.
- Hold on.

1405
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:07,541
A guy from
Eiben-Chemcorp's in your office.

1406
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:09,375
- I have a lunch.
- They're your biggest contributor.

1407
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,625
Give him his two
crappy little minutes.

1408
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:14,000
- Eiben-Chemcorp Pharmaceuticals?
- Yeah.

1409
01:33:14,041 --> 01:33:14,958


1410
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,541
Finally get to meet the guys
that keep the lights on.

1411
01:33:18,583 --> 01:33:19,166


1412
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:21,875
- Carl!
- Mr. Morra.

1413
01:33:21,916 --> 01:33:22,458


1414
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:25,916
What a surprise. They told me somebody
from Eiben was coming.

1415
01:33:26,041 --> 01:33:29,375
Chemcorp. Yeah, that's me now. I'm
moving out of the energy business.

1416
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:33,166
Come on. That's like Hef
moving out of the mansion.

1417
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:36,458
Yeah. I bought Eiben a couple of months
ago. I'm surprised you didn't hear.

1418
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:40,583
No. No. Well, they really
keep me hopping here.

1419
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:44,375
Well, it's gonna pay off,
Senator Morra.

1420
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:44,791


1421
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:47,208
The Senate. Who knows...

1422
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:51,208
Everything's a technicality
from here on in, isn't it, Eddie?

1423
01:33:51,333 --> 01:33:56,708
I think we both know where it's headed,
if you can maintain.

1424
01:33:56,750 --> 01:33:58,666


1425
01:33:58,708 --> 01:34:02,750
Have you asked yourself what
you're gonna do when you run out?

1426
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:17,583


1427
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:21,458
- When did you know?
- Does it matter? I know now.

1428
01:34:21,666 --> 01:34:25,041
I wish you'd come to me at first, Eddie.
I could have bought Eiben at 33 a share.

1429
01:34:25,166 --> 01:34:27,458
We could have been partners.

1430
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,291


1431
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:32,166
So, Eiben makes NZT.

1432
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:35,041
Well, it'll never officially exist.

1433
01:34:35,166 --> 01:34:38,500
Obviously, I don't need
to point out the advantages for you.

1434
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:40,041
Oh, I think maybe you do.

1435
01:34:40,166 --> 01:34:44,041
Limitless supply.
We know you can't get any more.

1436
01:34:44,166 --> 01:34:45,666
You sure about that?

1437
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:48,416
They shut down your lab this morning.

1438
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:50,083


1439
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:53,583
Eddie. I just want to help you,
that's all.

1440
01:34:53,708 --> 01:34:56,666
Keep you supplied.
No disruption in service.

1441
01:34:56,791 --> 01:34:59,666
Give you peace of mind.
That's all.

1442
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:00,458


1443
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:03,458
And in return, I do what?

1444
01:35:03,583 --> 01:35:07,375
Get a little advice, maybe.
I won't be bothering you much at first.

1445
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,875
And later. What are you
gonna be bothering me with?

1446
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,666
Well, given where you're heading,
some of our ideas are a bit ambitious.

1447
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:15,583
But hey, I think they're achievable.

1448
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:17,416
And what if I don't like your ideas?

1449
01:35:17,541 --> 01:35:19,875
Then we'll say, "Godspeed."

1450
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,333
And your candle will have shed a brief,
but lovely light.

1451
01:35:24,375 --> 01:35:25,333


1452
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:26,833
But you know what, Eddie,
let's not even

1453
01:35:26,958 --> 01:35:27,875
go there right now.

1454
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,250
Right now, I just want
to keep you brilliant...

1455
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:35,958
and healthy. Come on.
Let's go get some lunch.

1456
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:53,291


1457
01:35:53,333 --> 01:35:56,166
After you, Senator.

1458
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:56,791


1459
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:59,541
Thanks for stopping by, Carl.

1460
01:35:59,666 --> 01:36:01,375
Give us a second.

1461
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:04,125
What are you doing? Do you want
to be President of the United States

1462
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:06,875
- or brain dead, stuck full of tubes?
- I'll take my chances.

1463
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,208
I told you your chances don't exist.
We shut down your lab.

1464
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:11,458
You don't think
some smartass on NZT

1465
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:13,166
might have two or three
or even four labs?

1466
01:36:13,291 --> 01:36:15,375
- So what? You're not making any more.
- That's right, I'm not.

1467
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,541
I thought better of it.
See, once you know what's in it,

1468
01:36:17,666 --> 01:36:21,875
you can tweak it, re-engineer it.
Get the bugs out. Taper off.

1469
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,250
I'm off it, Carl.

1470
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:24,583
Well, on it or off it,

1471
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:26,958
there's no scenario
where you're not working for me.

1472
01:36:27,083 --> 01:36:28,541
How you gonna pay me?
In cigarettes?

1473
01:36:28,666 --> 01:36:29,791
Last year you traded

1474
01:36:29,916 --> 01:36:31,833
- inside information 17 times.
- You threatening me?

1475
01:36:31,958 --> 01:36:34,958
Blank checks from Dubai.
Dumping in Chile. Disappeared officials.

1476
01:36:35,083 --> 01:36:37,125
- I mean, you shed a spotlight...
- Do you want to go to war with me?

1477
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:39,333
And trust me when I say this,
I'm not even being creative.

1478
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:41,375
There's no way you can be making
accusations like that

1479
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,750
and be walking around alive.

1480
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:46,416
That you would even think that shows me
how unprepared you are to fight me.

1481
01:36:46,541 --> 01:36:48,041
- You're no longer equipped to fight me.
- I may be off it,

1482
01:36:48,166 --> 01:36:50,541
but you think I didn't learn anything?
That my synapses didn't change?

1483
01:36:50,666 --> 01:36:51,916
That I kept absolutely nothing?

1484
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:53,583
You have no idea what
kind of enemy I can be.

1485
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:56,541
- That van's gonna rear-end that taxi.
- What?

1486
01:36:56,666 --> 01:36:59,250
The driver's distracted. He's texting.
He's going 30 miles an hour.

1487
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:01,125
He has 60 feet to stop.
He doesn't have room.

1488
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:03,875
What van?

1489
01:37:03,916 --> 01:37:06,291


1490
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:07,708
I see everything, Carl.

1491
01:37:07,833 --> 01:37:10,041
I'm 50 moves ahead of you
and everybody else.

1492
01:37:10,166 --> 01:37:12,458
What makes you think I don't have a guy
with a bead on you right now?

1493
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:14,250
How do you know you're gonna be alive
this time next year?

1494
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:17,500
What are you doing? You get
your hands off me. What are you doing?

1495
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:20,333
Something's pumping half-mass in there.
The walls of your heart are dilated.

1496
01:37:20,458 --> 01:37:24,500
Your aortic valve's steno. So you're
gonna need to get that replaced.

1497
01:37:24,541 --> 01:37:25,375


1498
01:37:25,416 --> 01:37:27,875
But you already knew that.

1499
01:37:27,916 --> 01:37:32,791


1500
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:34,666
You know, you should
really be glad about this.

1501
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:38,666
'Cause me working for you?
You'd end up as my bitch.

1502
01:37:38,708 --> 01:37:49,708


1503
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:53,375
Maybe we should cool off.
Talk again.

1504
01:37:53,416 --> 01:37:54,291


1505
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:57,041
I don't think so.

1506
01:37:57,083 --> 01:37:57,791


1507
01:37:57,833 --> 01:37:59,875
Don't forget to vote.

1508
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:07,291


1509
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:08,708
Edward.

1510
01:38:08,833 --> 01:38:10,416
You good?

1511
01:38:10,541 --> 01:38:14,375
Yeah. Told you I have a lunch.

1512
01:38:14,416 --> 01:38:19,416


1513
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:22,666
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey. Don't worry.

1514
01:38:22,708 --> 01:38:23,833


1515
01:38:23,875 --> 01:38:27,250
- How's your day going?
- I've had better.

1516
01:38:27,291 --> 01:38:28,250


1517
01:38:28,291 --> 01:38:30,208
I still can't deal
with that haircut.

1518
01:38:30,333 --> 01:38:32,375
I wouldn't even
recognize you on the street.

1519
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:35,125
Well, I'm a new man.

1520
01:38:35,166 --> 01:38:35,541


1521
01:38:35,583 --> 01:38:37,458
I've already ordered.

1522
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:52,458


1523
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:55,041
What?

1524
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:56,041


1525
01:38:56,083 --> 01:39:58,583
