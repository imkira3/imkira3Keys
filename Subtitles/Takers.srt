2
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,553
I'm all right.

3
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,349
Keep telling yourself that.

4
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,868
That right there?

5
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,788
That is the best homework assignment
the city ever came up with.

6
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:24,083
Yeah. Me and the kid start this weekend.

7
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,420
That is, of course, unless Amanda botches
everything up, like she always does.

8
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,423
I could have Monica give her a call.
They always got along pretty well.

9
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,760
You know, Eddie, I appreciate it,
but it's best if you stay out of it.

10
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,846
Yo, D'Mac, what's up?

11
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,683
Yeah, I'm interested. What do you got?

12
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,522
Haitians. Boyle Heights.

13
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,275
Yeah, I know the place.

14
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,862
3-B, got it.

15
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,281
Ya yo changing hands.

16
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,408
You really wanna mess with
this low-level shit?

17
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,535
Yeah, let's go.

18
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,403
- Are we good?
- All signs point to it.

19
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,615
Which one of you gentlemen
is gonna sign for this?

20
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,953
Nice suit.

21
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,751
I heard there was a problem with the toilet?

22
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,255
All right, fellas.
We got less than one hour. Let's go.

23
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,854
Move.

24
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,123
- Police, freeze!
- Shit!

25
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,627
- Get him!
- On the floor, God damn it!

26
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,463
Stop!

27
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,304
Don't move!

28
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,196
- You got him?
- He got away.

29
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,199
- What?
- He got away!

30
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,827
Shit!

31
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,165
Not a word, Welles. Not a goddamn word!

32
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,084
Son of a bitch!

33
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,734
Now.

34
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,698
What the...

35
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,868
Chief. We got a problem with the elevators.

36
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,749
- Get down!
- And stay down!

37
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,381
Now that I have your attention,
get on the floor, right now!

38
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,799
- Take it easy, take it easy.
- Everyone!

39
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,092
- You, too, come on!
- Get down!

40
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,219
Everything's reading "Malfunction."

41
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,513
- The hell is this?
- I don't know.

42
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,056
We're not here to hurt you!

43
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,560
You stay calm, you go home for dinner,
you understand me?

44
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,315
Don't look at me.

45
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,410
Nobody move! And get down on the floor!

46
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,287
Shut up!

47
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,124
We got a naughty one here.

48
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,085
Jesus! FedCal, the bank.

49
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,297
All right, that's it, bad girl.
Now we get to go make a phone call.

50
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,718
Forty-five!

51
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,807
<i>- News 14 hotline.</i>
- Tell them there's a robbery in progress.

52
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,518
I'm from the FedCal Bank, downtown LA.

53
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,853
There's a robbery in progress.

54
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,396
<i>- Are they still in the bank?</i>
- They're still...

55
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,481
<i>Are they...</i>

56
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,566
Come on, man, let's get out of here.

57
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,860
Let's go!

58
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,945
Jump!

59
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,197
Get down!

60
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,206
Hey, guys, a bank robbery.
We're headed downtown.

61
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,332
Let's go, now!

62
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,218
- I got the back!
- I'm on it!

63
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,844
They left the bank using the stairs!

64
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,679
All exits are covered.

65
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,047
Look, on the roof, a guard! Land it!

66
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,677
- We're not cleared for this.
- We're first on the scene. Land us, now.

67
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,809
Let's go!

68
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,228
Get the camera out.

69
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,689
Are you okay?

70
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,732
- No!
- Get on the ground!

71
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,444
Get on the ground!
Get out of the chopper now!

72
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,028
Take a seat next to your friends!

73
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,584
What a bunch of dummies! Good boy.

74
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,086
Nothing but glorified paparazzi!

75
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,846
Get us out of here!

76
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,741
<i>There goes Channel 14 going the wrong way.</i>

77
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,160
That's why they're in last place.

78
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,412
Come on, Rivers, you're a free man.

79
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,581
You're out of here.

80
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,850
Any vacant floors?

81
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,852
Yeah, 26 is under construction.

82
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,854
You got security cameras on that floor?

83
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,105
Not in the construction area.

84
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,565
Have forensics go over it.

85
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,609
You'll pick up prints
from half the damn city.

86
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,235
Do it anyway.

87
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,695
- You got it.
- Okay.

88
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,114
Went down pretty fast. We got a mixed crew.

89
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,450
Apparently, one of the guys
had some type of an accent.

90
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,368
- How much did they take?
- North of two million.

91
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,661
Some of the bills might be marked.

92
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,706
Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky.

93
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,328
So, they used C-4 to knock out the elevators.

94
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,372
Residue's being sent to the lab now.

95
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,792
Thanks. Automatic weapons,
precision timing.

96
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,088
Shape charges.
Degree of difficulty is off the charts.

97
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,549
They were hot shit, no doubt about that.

98
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,344
It'll make it that much sweeter
when we take them down.

99
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,428
Yeah.

100
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,653
What is it you want?

101
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,905
You Sergei?

102
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,658
Mikhail, from in the joint, sent me.

103
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,286
Okay.

104
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,502
Y'all having fun, huh?

105
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,629
Not so fast, my man.

106
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,214
Show me ID.

107
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,512
USA! USA! USA!

108
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,893
Think about it.

109
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,568
Cool down.

110
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,990
We... We have vodka
and take care of business, huh?

111
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,995
That's what I thought you'd say.

112
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,914
We've got some serious stacks now.

113
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,708
And I mean it's love, baby.

114
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,504
- Yeah, we did all right.
- All right, my ass.

115
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,343
Our biggest heist yet,
and you, you don't seem too jazzed.

116
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,721
No, I'm good.

117
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,681
I'm good.

118
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,436
Listen, Dad called last night.

119
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,856
He wants us to come see him.

120
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,275
No. Hell, no, Jake.

121
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,695
I've been to see Dad in jail.
I've been to juvie.

122
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,199
I'm not going back. Not for you, not for Dad,

123
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,994
- not for anybody. Ever.
- Okay, okay.

124
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,039
He's got less than five.

125
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,916
So, when he gets out,

126
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,794
maybe we build him a house.

127
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,715
- Cool?
- Cool.

128
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,349
Gordon says you find anything marked,
burn it.

129
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,272
Sounds tight.

130
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,400
You just gonna leave your kid bro up there
with all that paper?

131
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,861
If he runs out with it, shoot him.

132
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,613
I will, too.

133
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,449
Remember the song?

134
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,328
A'ight.

135
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,087
I don't know what to tell you.
We're so... We're so busy. Look at this.

136
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,800
And if we get that empty space next door,
think about how amazing it's gonna be.

137
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,931
- What's this?
- Open it.

138
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,229
Oh, my God.

139
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,613
It's beautiful.

140
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,449
I think you're beautiful, too.

141
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,454
If you'll have me,

142
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,545
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.

143
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,738
Cocky assholes.

144
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,206
Tapes are ready.

145
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,208
All right, let's see what we got.

146
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,417
There's 20 elevators for the lobby.

147
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,378
Twelve for the lower floors,
eight for the uppers.

148
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,213
You can cross over at 22.

149
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,507
So, over the course of the day,
how many people on and off?

150
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,258
- Ten thousand, give or take.
- Shit.

151
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,219
Well, let's see who got off
on the construction floor.

152
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,929
It couldn't have been more
than a handful of people.

153
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,640
Well, it doesn't work that way.
These tapes are time-coded, not floor-coded.

154
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,016
All these people getting on and off

155
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,769
and we have no idea
what floor we're watching?

156
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,354
Yeah. I mean, that's how it works.

157
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,982
Come on.
This is some system you got here, Chief.

158
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,900
Most of the buildings in the city
are set up this way.

159
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,111
- Whoever set it up is an idiot.
- Hey, I don't need this!

160
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,237
All right, I'm down here trying to help.

161
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,155
Hey. Look, man,
he doesn't mean nothing by it, all right?

162
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,782
- Thanks for coming by, okay?
- Screw you.

163
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,538
Meds not working
or we just need to get you laid?

164
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,623
- What's the problem?
- Look at this.

165
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,793
It's a camera.
They knew the elevator was empty.

166
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,129
They knew the building.
They knew the whole system.

167
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,048
Yeah, must be a hundred hours here.

168
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,758
We don't know
what the hell we're looking for.

169
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,888
Not to piss on Grand Cayman,

170
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,391
but I think I can get you an additional
75 basis points

171
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,393
in the Dutch Antilles. I say why not?

172
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,437
Yeah, but the way the markets
keep jumping around, man,

173
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,397
another four, six weeks,
who knows what the rates'll be?

174
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,399
And have you seen
the latest Bloomberg report?

175
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,485
- Shit is bleak out there.
- "Bloomberg reports"? Are you kidding me?

176
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,404
Come on, college guys.
Let's not over-think it.

177
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,489
Yeah, come on.
Dutch Antilles wanna pay us more money.

178
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,158
- That's a no-brainer.
- I like the Dutch Antilles,

179
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,702
as long as the banks don't pack up
and take my money overnight.

180
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,163
Of course. 10% to the usual charities?

181
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,873
- Absolutely.
- Cool by me.

182
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,667
I chartered a jet.
It's taking off Van Nuys Airport tonight.

183
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,629
Anybody wants to come,
I got your private parking passes right here.

184
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,214
It'll be sweet.

185
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,967
Man, life's looking pretty good
from right here.

186
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,802
I'll let you know later.

187
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,455
Nice house. Cool view.

188
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,958
Great scotch.

189
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,714
You know, jacking that news chopper
had "A.J." written all over it.

190
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,841
How'd you get in my house?

191
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,677
Please.

192
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,888
They let you out early or what?

193
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,766
Good behavior. About a year early.

194
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,769
But I guess you guys kind of lost track, huh?

195
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,231
No contact. That's what we agreed upon.
So, what's up?

196
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,609
I think I'm gonna have another scotch.

197
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,822
It's good shit, John.
You gonna drink with me, right?

198
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,406
Sure you are.

199
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,991
You see, I came to you, John,

200
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,036
because you the one with that
higher consciousness and shit.

201
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,081
- All right, I'm listening.
- Well, you asked what's up.

202
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,043
I miss my homies. That's what's up.

203
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,879
That, and some unfinished business.

204
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,632
Your money from '04 is safe
and accruing interest.

205
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,883
Gordon's got the bank account numbers.

206
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,011
What about Lilli? Who's got her numbers?

207
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,556
She's with Jake now.

208
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:11,399
Well, good for them.
I got a deal we need to discuss.

209
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,736
- A job.
- You're kidding me, right?

210
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,530
You're coming at me with a job right now?

211
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,323
Think I'd come at you on some bullshit?

212
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,119
Once in a lifetime, John. You know me.

213
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,996
I do my homework.

214
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,455
All right, so what do you
want me to say here?

215
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,166
You ain't got to say shit.

216
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,086
Just remember I was the one left bleeding
on that fire escape in '04.

217
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,339
And they tried everything they could
to flip me.

218
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,718
I ain't budge, 'cause we had a deal.
I kept my end.

219
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,722
I kept this, too. You owe me, bro.

220
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,806
All of you.

221
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,434
What were you, boosting Camaros
back in Riverside

222
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,227
when me and Gordon decided to let you in?

223
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,479
So, don't be so quick to write me off.

224
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,446
All right, I'll talk to the boys
and I'll get back at you tomorrow.

225
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,576
You do that. Love the place.

226
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,412
Alarm system sucks, though.

227
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,874
There she is.

228
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,960
Hello. How's my baby G doing?

229
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,837
I'm good, I'm fine.

230
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,881
- You look good.
- I feel good.

231
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,466
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah.

232
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,510
They tell me maybe
you finish the program next week.

233
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,096
It's been a tough eight weeks.

234
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,016
Don't worry. I'm gonna do it this time.

235
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,060
That's what my mind
and my body's telling me.

236
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,938
I'm with you. I'm with you.
You know that, right?

237
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,106
- Yeah?
- I'm not gonna need these anymore.

238
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,233
By the time I leave here,

239
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,318
I'm gonna be cleaner
than the day I was born.

240
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,822
You know I'm grateful, don't you?

241
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,992
Stop it. You don't need to say that to me,
all right?

242
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,620
- Did you get my letter?
- Yeah, sure did.

243
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,167
I've been non-stop tripping over this,
I tell you.

244
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,878
- Caribbean, huh?
- Look at the water.

245
00:20:56,171 --> 00:21:00,466
Clear and blue.
Cool and warm at the same time.

246
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,052
I've just got to get back there.

247
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,638
Soon as you're out of here,
I'm gonna take you there myself.

248
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,515
- I promise.
- All right.

249
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,352
I love you.

250
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,989
Turn that off.

251
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,532
I know, so I walk into my house.

252
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,409
He's standing there,
he's drinking my whiskey.

253
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,286
I was gonna shoot him
in the back of his head.

254
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,371
Should've shot him.

255
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,040
The guy's been out 24 hours,
already wants to do a job.

256
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,417
- He's crazy.
- Or he's got huge balls.

257
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,544
Yeah, Ghost doesn't play
when it comes to money.

258
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,754
He's too smart for that.

259
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,381
- The bastard's not that smart.
- That's for sure.

260
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,507
He's clever, not smart.

261
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,884
You guys, we always wait
at least a year between jobs.

262
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,845
- There's a reason for that.
- Gordon, you guys go way back, right?

263
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,222
Think he's being straight up?

264
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,099
Ghost could've ratted us out
a long time ago,

265
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,434
but he didn't. Kept his word.

266
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,646
What's to stop him from doing exactly that
once we give him his cut from '04?

267
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,939
- See, that's the problem.
- Yeah.

268
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,066
- That's a big problem there.
- Something ain't right.

269
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,484
- I don't trust him.
- Relax.

270
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,736
- He's trouble.
- I think he's onto something, though.

271
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,865
- He says it's big.
- Do I look like I care what he says?

272
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,911
Well, whatever you decide to do,
I'm down with you.

273
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,579
- All right.
- I'm going to the loft.

274
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,123
Private party!

275
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,625
- Where you going?
- None of your damn business!

276
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,545
- Gentlemen.
- It's Lilli.

277
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,006
- Baby, who ordered the Dom?
- That's for Johnny-boy.

278
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,175
It's the girl in the green at the bar.

279
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,805
She's cute.

280
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,766
- Don't let her pay for it.
- No, no, she's gonna pay, man.

281
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,934
This is how it's done. Let me show you.

282
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,937
Slow down, lvy League.
This ain't the frat house, man.

283
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,357
Well, that's some funny shit, man.
That's some funny shit.

284
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,738
I'll come back up later.

285
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,868
- Ghost.
- It's been a long time, girl.

286
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,538
- When did you get out?
- Why? You miss me?

287
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,791
Ghost. You need to back up.

288
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,710
Easy, Jake. Easy.

289
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:27,381
I wish you guys the best. Really.
It's the past.

290
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,467
I'm here to discuss the future.

291
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,051
If I may.

292
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,721
Told you tomorrow, Ghost.

293
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,557
I'm not here to bust any balls. Just business.

294
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,058
A'ight?

295
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,020
A.J. Any new tats?

296
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,731
- Yeah, man, couple.
- Me, too.

297
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,275
- G.
- Ghost.

298
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,818
How's my man?

299
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,071
I'm doing good, mate.

300
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,540
Lot of tension in the room, huh?

301
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,292
What do you want, Ghost?

302
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,252
Goddamn.

303
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,671
It's like that?

304
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,507
It's like that.

305
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,510
Well, I'll be brief.

306
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,516
Let's say we go Italian Job on that ass.

307
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,235
Why don't we take this upstairs, Ghost?

308
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,736
Fair enough.

309
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,575
Same plan as before, gentlemen.
25 to 30 mil.

310
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,538
All the cash we can carry.
Got to move fast, though.

311
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,872
When you say "fast," how fast?

312
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,749
Next Tuesday.

313
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,626
What?

314
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,463
Ghost, you want us to take down
an armored truck in five days?

315
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,799
I mean, it's not even worth talking about
unless you got the route,

316
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,050
and they change the route all the time.

317
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,511
- That's what screwed us last time.
- Yeah, man, you got the route?

318
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,806
I got it. Exact one from next Tuesday.

319
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,641
Any more questions?

320
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,143
- How'd you get it?
- In the joint.

321
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,187
I got in good with this Russian.

322
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,148
Had the pleasure of keeping them guys
from Compton off his ass.

323
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,235
In exchange, he had his comrades
on the outside

324
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,612
put the arm down on the dispatcher.

325
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,282
So the dispatcher do anything
to screw the job up,

326
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,994
they're wiping out his whole family
back at the Ukraine.

327
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,412
Down to the sheepdog.

328
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,038
Why should we trust the Russians?

329
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,584
They love their sheepdogs.

330
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,378
All bullshit aside,

331
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,841
I'm in for a quarter mil with the Russians
out my cut when the job's done.

332
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,093
It's not your concern,

333
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,804
so don't trust the Russians. Trust greed.

334
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,181
- Why should we trust you?
- Well, shit, A.J.

335
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:45,144
I'm fresh out. I ain't in no hurry to go back.

336
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:48,397
Besides, why would I screw over my guys?

337
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,150
Especially when
you're holding all my money, right?

338
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,068
Okay. What about the setup?

339
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,071
I mean, there's knowing the route,
and then there's the logistics, you know.

340
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,283
Five days. Jake's right.
That's a real, real short fuse.

341
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,493
That's where you come in.

342
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,122
But I trust that when you and Jake
put your heads together, you'll figure it out.

343
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,875
Either way, I need to know tonight.

344
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,502
You ain't got the heart to pull it off, a'ight.

345
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:14,048
We'll settle up on the money you owe me,
I'm sayonara.

346
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,347
Appreciate your time, gentlemen.
Thanks for the cigar.

347
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,646
- Hey, G, let me check out that route.
- Yeah.

348
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,483
This is not the way we do things, gentlemen.
It's too fast, it's too rushed.

349
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,902
It's a lot of money,
but this whole thing feels forced.

350
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,446
Five days? Five?

351
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,616
Yeah, man, but, you know,
we can get the setup right.

352
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,784
Bet big, win big.

353
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,369
It's the only way to play.

354
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,414
We're takers, gents.
That's what we do for a living.

355
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,333
We take.

356
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,834
It's a lot of money, Jake.

357
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,214
- And that's what we're here for.
- You sure about this?

358
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,591
If it checks out.

359
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,223
If it checks out, I'm in.

360
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,360
- Yeah, what's up?
<i>- Thought you'd wanna know,</i>

361
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,237
your Haitian buddy?

362
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,698
His lawyerjust filed on you
for excessive force.

363
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,033
All right. The guy was 6'5", he was resisting.

364
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,284
What was I supposed to do?

365
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,953
Yeah, well, you must've hurt his feelings.

366
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:30,082
The bank. Hey, listen, what about the C-4
they used to blow the elevators?

367
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,293
Well, from the taggants, forensics traced it
to a mining company out of Nevada,

368
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,713
stolen about... About two months ago.

369
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,506
All right. And what about the marked bills?

370
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,051
Bank finally sent over a list.
Max is gonna fax out a memo right now.

371
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,013
Listen, man,

372
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,184
<i>it's been a couple of weeks now.</i>
<i>You hear anDhing from Amanda?</i>

373
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,520
Listen, I appreciate it,
but I don't need any help.

374
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,940
We can work it out on our own. But thanks.

375
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,152
All right. I'll talk to you later.

376
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,997
All right, so, for this route
Ghost is talking about.

377
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,375
The only place we stand a chance
is right there.

378
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,002
- What's there?
- It's an old subway car turnaround.

379
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,588
It's large enough,
and it runs parallel to the street.

380
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,257
It's kind of perfect.
I mean, we can get access on Hope Street,

381
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,926
but I say we hold them up
at Olive and Fourth.

382
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,887
All right.

383
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,347
And we need to get down there
first and get some intel on,

384
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:32,102
you know, street patterns, traffic density,
that sort of thing, but it looks good.

385
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,522
Once we determine the blast radius
and street density,

386
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,484
I can tell you how much C-4
you're gonna need to score.

387
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,818
What about the exits?

388
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,945
Work in progress, G.

389
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,698
You know, we got to get down there first,
check it out.

390
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,576
- Give me some exits.
- You got it.

391
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,369
- It's good work.
- Cool.

392
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,789
- All right, gang.
- Good to go.

393
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,416
Easy money, baby. Same as before.

394
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,794
All the cash is in the front truck.

395
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,338
Second truck's totally empty. Just an escort.

396
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,216
Two men up front, two men in the back.

397
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,927
Pump action 12-gauge
and.40 caliber Glocks.

398
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,261
Maybe 9mm.

399
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,972
They may have upgraded
their communication by now,

400
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,724
but the same standard bulletproof windows.

401
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,646
They ain't gonna know what hit them.

402
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,909
Here we go. Must've taken up the tracks.

403
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,089
That's it.

404
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,231
Yeah, he's still working it.

405
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,650
Got brand-new wheels to show for it, too.

406
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,278
All right, let's go.

407
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,905
All right, wait for my go-ahead.

408
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,623
- Good morning, Franco. Nice wheels!
- What do you guys want?

409
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,833
- Get up against the car.
- Turn around.

410
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,793
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm clean, man.

411
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,212
Hands off. All right?
Why don't you move your car?

412
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,464
What do you know about some
C-4 boosted out of Nevada?

413
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,799
Nevada? I don't know nothing about that.

414
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,176
Come on, if it's guns or explosives,
you heard something about it.

415
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,721
You know, you get busted again,
you're facing 10 years minimum.

416
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,806
- You know that, right?
- I know this is a public place.

417
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,350
I ain't done nothing.
So, why don't you move your car?

418
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,394
- Do me a favor.
- Hey, Hatch.

419
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,062
- Look at this!
- What you got?

420
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,565
- What's that?
- Come on, Franco.

421
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,567
- It's a damn shame.
- Looks like you caught a nail.

422
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,319
- Yeah, you got a flat.
- Twice.

423
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,571
- Come on.
- You got a spare in the trunk, right?

424
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,698
- Come on, I'll help you. Come on.
- You wanna check my trunk,

425
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,909
why don't you go get yourselves a warrant?

426
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,913
Hey, Dispatch, we got a disabled vehicle
on 9th and the 110.

427
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,248
How long would it take to get here?

428
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,791
<i>Yeah, right around the corner.</i>

429
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,001
You got one in the area.

430
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,879
That's great. It's my lucky day.
I'll see you in a minute.

431
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,048
You guys must think I'm stupid
or something, right?

432
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,508
- Bring it in!
- Man, what the hell is this?

433
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,260
Come on! This has got to be illegal!

434
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,386
- No.
- Entrapment or some shit!

435
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,221
This looks like a disabled vehicle to me.

436
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,264
Hey, don't worry about it.

437
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,725
We'll do a full inventory,
including everything in the trunk.

438
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,228
Yeah, we wouldn't want you
accusing the LAPD of stealing anything.

439
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,898
- Hey, come on, all right? Hey!
- Give us something, Franco.

440
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,943
- Give us something.
- This here is bullshit! Come on, man!

441
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,778
Come on, Franco, what do you wanna do?

442
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,905
You know, you two guys,
you're a couple of...

443
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,365
- All right, hook it up!
- What are you doing?

444
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,283
- Come on! Be nice, it's a new car!
- What are you doing?

445
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,786
Okay, okay, okay, all right!
I got something for you guys, all right?

446
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,870
- Come here.
- What do you got?

447
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,247
There's... They got these guys,
they're trying to go upscale.

448
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,457
- They're planning something big.
- What?

449
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,000
They're definitely planning
something real big.

450
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,877
- Like what?
- I don't know like what.

451
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,004
But I know they're gonna use a C-4
on the job.

452
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,140
What's up?

453
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,558
'Sup.

454
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:19,830
You alone?

455
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,916
Like I said on the phone.

456
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,210
He's clean.

457
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,546
- No one.
- You Paulie?

458
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,923
Like the sign says.

459
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,093
So, you're the one who wants some C-4?

460
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,511
Like I said on the phone.

461
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:38,390
I know, the street's gone dry.
Someone bought up a big pile of it.

462
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,599
That what brings you to me?

463
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,477
- Smart man.
- Yeah.

464
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,773
So, let me see your category one permit.

465
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,944
Permit? Thought this was
supposed to be simple.

466
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,322
It is. You got a permit.

467
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,744
My category one.

468
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,583
Yeah, it is simple.

469
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,502
See, we take your money,
and you don't get shit.

470
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,494
Get over here!

471
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,671
Hey, whoa! Hey. Come on.

472
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,551
Move, I put three holes in your head
like a bowling ball, big boy.

473
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,387
Should've kept it simple, huh?

474
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,432
- Thought you might need some backup.
- Backup?

475
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,101
Looked like you getting your ass kicked.

476
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,770
Man, I told you guys to wait in the car.

477
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,272
- You had it under control, huh?
- Yeah, I did, actually.

478
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,108
- Where's the C-4?
- It's in the shed.

479
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,859
- Speak English! Where's the C-4?
- It's in the shed!

480
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,778
- Back in the shed!
- In the shed?

481
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,780
- It's in the shed?
- Back in the shed.

482
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,908
It's in the shed.

483
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,163
Nice job squeezing Franco.

484
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,958
Looking at 10 years,
funny how he gave up that address.

485
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,042
Think it's the FedCal guys?

486
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,045
Only so many people know
how to use C-4, Chief.

487
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,422
- Duncan!
- Lieutenant Carver?

488
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,675
- Moving and grooving, Jack!
- I wanna speak to Detective Welles!

489
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,218
I can't do this right now.

490
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,053
We're executing a search warrant.

491
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,763
Police work. Remember what that is?

492
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,181
Internal Affairs will have to wait.

493
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,642
Hey, you call me, Welles. Get back to me!

494
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,602
You don't want me to
have to come find you!

495
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,606
The hell is wrong with you,
coming down here now?

496
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,151
I wanna show you something.

497
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,252
Police, on the ground now!

498
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,672
Go!

499
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,455
Welles, I got nothing.

500
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,838
Hatch, he's coming up on Spring!

501
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,467
Shit!

502
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,562
Welles!

503
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,535
- You all right?
- Yeah.

504
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,626
Our two dead guys,
Ethan and Constantine Symanski.

505
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,380
Brothers. Suspected Russian mob,
but they're no good for the FedCal job.

506
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,049
- Why's that?
- INS said they were being sworn in

507
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,051
as U.S. Citizens at the time of the robbery.

508
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,679
- Couple patriots, huh?
- Yeah.

509
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,889
They burned a bunch of stuff
before we got here.

510
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,267
This is all that was left.

511
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,561
Looks like a map of LA.

512
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,272
Yeah. Maybe.

513
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:44,029
Look at this stuff.
C-4, automatic weapons, blasting caps.

514
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,741
They were definitely onto something big.

515
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:59,294
Staples Center, Pershing Square,
Union Station.

516
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,922
The hell were they up to?

517
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,607
- We're good to go.
- Jake's all connected. You ready?

518
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,858
All right, Jesse, we're up.

519
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,610
Show it to us.

520
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,912
Nice.

521
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,872
All right, tell Jake to stop showing off.

522
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,457
All right, man, turn it off.

523
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,250
- Good job.
- Good job.

524
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,839
But the point is, I mean,
can we do it in three days?

525
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,759
Not only can we do it,
but we're gonna play it safe.

526
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,095
All right, we're gonna drill at
about an inch an hour,

527
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,222
16 holes in 64 hours.

528
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,766
Split the work, keep the schedule.

529
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,893
So, that leaves us one last day for prep?

530
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,396
Exactly. Enough time for Jake and I to wire.
It's good.

531
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,524
All right, I'm gonna call Rahway
and see if we can get down there tonight.

532
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,612
Who's there?

533
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,159
G!

534
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,121
Naomi. What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at the...

535
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,997
I know, I know, I...

536
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,625
- Catch up with you later, man.
- All right, man.

537
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,293
Wow, look at this place.

538
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,586
What is this? Naomi?

539
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,339
Look, I am really clean now. I feel great.

540
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,424
Naomi, what are you talking about?

541
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,843
Look, another week in that place
wouldn't have made any difference.

542
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,095
- We spoke about this, didn't we?
- Come on.

543
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,430
I was doing really well.

544
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,099
I asked if I could leave early,
and they said yes.

545
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,643
If you don't believe me, call them.

546
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:42,355
Look, they told us that when you get out,
you got to have a plan.

547
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,024
Yeah? Without a plan, you're dead.

548
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,987
So I started thinking about you and me,
our plan, and going home.

549
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,071
And that's gonna happen.

550
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,241
You had one more week, that's all,
one more week.

551
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,618
It's a busy time for me, Naomi.

552
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,790
- You don't remember it, do you?
- No, I don't.

553
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:05,545
Look at how cute you were.
Mum was so beautiful.

554
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,841
I was truly happy back then.

555
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,637
I'm not gonna be right until I get back there,
so I can start again.

556
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,557
And we can. In just three days.

557
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,143
I'm working. I need to put you in a hotel.

558
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,478
What? Why can't I stay here?

559
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,939
You can. It's just a bad time for me.

560
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,484
All right?

561
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,611
Yeah.

562
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,491
Well, I can tell you it's not a street map.

563
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,618
It's some kind of a public works project.

564
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,787
But without a reference number,
there's no way I can work it out.

565
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,456
All right. Thanks.

566
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,832
You got it.

567
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,454
Rivers, Delonte.

568
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,135
Put your body in it.

569
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,973
Right here, Eddie. Up with it.

570
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,642
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

571
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,937
Hey, Eddie.
Take it easy on Uncle Jack, all right?

572
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:51,234
Time out. I did some work last night.
Wanted to talk to you.

573
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,278
Hey, if you're gonna puke, do it on the grass.

574
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,446
Come on, Dad, let us finish.

575
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,990
Yeah, why don't you take my place?

576
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,659
I'm good. Go ahead, keep playing, Eddie.

577
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,664
- Eddie looks like he's doing a lot better.
- Yeah, he's doing great, man.

578
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:08,001
I mean, it's been about a month
since his last dialysis.

579
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,546
Down for a couple days,
then he bounces back. I mean...

580
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,966
- So, anyway, what's up?
- All right.

581
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,011
You remember the jewelry job
in Koreatown, few years back?

582
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,930
They used wires
and went from one building to the other?

583
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,016
Guard got loose.
He ended up shooting one of them?

584
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,101
Yeah. The guard ended up being
like a big hero.

585
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,936
The perp got shot on a fire escape, right?

586
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,440
Name's Delonte Rivers, a.k.a. Ghost.

587
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,692
He just finished serving five at Chino.

588
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,988
And somehow, his prison ID ended up
at the Russians.

589
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,323
I saw it in the Polaroids.

590
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,116
So, you think this guy's good
for the FedCal heist?

591
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,620
I don't know. He was released the same day
the bank was hit.

592
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,913
There's got to be some type of
connection there, right?

593
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,376
Yeah, Max. What's up?

594
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,338
- Morning, Jack.
- Hey, Monica.

595
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,716
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

596
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,552
- Marketing rep.
- You got to be kidding me.

597
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,472
Look, Max, you can just tell Carver
he can call me Monday.

598
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,015
I don't work weekends, okay?

599
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,145
Internal Affairs.

600
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,648
Well, can I make you some breakfast, Jack?

601
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:15,818
No, that's all right. I got to pick Sunday up.
We're gonna go look at some landmarks.

602
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,655
- I'll see you Monday.
- See you, Jack.

603
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,033
So, what do we got?
What's the assignment for today?

604
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:25,578
After we go to the Walk of Fame,
I'm supposed to write about us going there.

605
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:30,041
Honey, the Walk of Fame's not a landmark,
it's a tourist trap.

606
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,504
I got a better landmark.
Let's go over to La Brea Tar Pits,

607
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,464
and then afterwards
we can go to the museum,

608
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,632
we can look at the fossils.

609
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,843
And then after that, we can go to
the Farmer's Market and get some burgers.

610
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:44,389
Good idea.
Burgers and shakes at the Farmer's Market.

611
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,973
Yeah, what do you got for me?

612
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,769
Sweetheart, we're gonna have
to make a stop somewhere first.

613
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,568
When I got your message from last night,
I pulled Rivers' file,

614
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,904
saw he was due this afternoon.

615
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,115
Cons like him,
they're good for a visit or two.

616
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,742
But four years of lockdown,
I wouldn't bet on him.

617
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,579
There's your boy now.
Want me to hold him? Rattle his cage?

618
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,582
No. No, keep it routine.

619
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,628
- You got an address on this guy?
- Some dump in Long Beach.

620
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,672
Probably good for a week, if that.

621
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,298
All right, thanks.

622
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,595
Little Tokyo. Let's go.

623
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,349
Now are we going to the museum?

624
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,144
Just a sec, honey. We will.

625
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,987
- Anything else?
- Give me a couple of these, too.

626
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,739
Here, on the right.

627
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,366
- Thanks, man.
- You got it.

628
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,682
- What's up?
- You're late.

629
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,393
- How'd the parole meeting go?
- We good.

630
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,355
You know they try and turn pissing in a cup
into a seven-game series.

631
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,440
We straight, though.

632
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,025
- Can I help you?
- Relish.

633
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,615
- Jesse.
- What's up?

634
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,117
What's happening? Where the guys?

635
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,077
I'm take-out. They're waiting on me.

636
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,287
Sounds good.

637
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,999
- So, did you get it?
- Come on, man. It's me.

638
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,543
What are you looking at, Daddy?

639
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,129
Just a second, honey.

640
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,423
Same thing the rescue workers use.

641
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,218
Easy as shit. Works just like a can opener.

642
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,261
- Speak to the dispatcher?
- Yeah.

643
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,433
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I spoke to him this morning. We good.

644
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,978
- Come on, man.
- Hey, the route's a lock, G.

645
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,565
Talk to you later.

646
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,943
Hey, man, find you something else
to worry about, G.

647
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,653
I got you, homes.

648
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,825
What?

649
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,338
Hold on to your seat, honey.

650
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,969
What are you doing, idiot?

651
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,114
You see a pen, baby? No?

652
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,837
There, you see that blue sedan back there?
Two cars back?

653
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,799
- Yeah.
- He's sharking us.

654
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,177
Make a right.

655
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,599
You have a pen, baby? Anything?

656
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,948
All right, make another right.

657
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,126
- He's staying with us.
- Yeah.

658
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,419
Let's pull over.

659
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:49,967
- Who are they?
- They're just some guys.

660
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,691
- Is it a cop?
- With a kid?

661
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,699
What's so important that you'd drag my ass
all the way down here?

662
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,743
- I found him, Hatch.
- Who?

663
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:19,455
Him, FedCal. Gordon Cozier.
I mean, look at that.

664
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,290
Same height, same build, same everything.

665
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,792
Wait, hold on. What are you talking about?

666
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,961
- Where's all this coming from?
- I followed that guy, Rivers,

667
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,253
from his parole meeting.

668
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,506
- And he gets out of a cab downtown.
- With Sunday?

669
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,466
What, are you gunning for
Father of the Year now?

670
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,219
And from my car,
I see him go to this hot-dog stand.

671
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,013
And Cozier's there.
Now, he's got his back to me.

672
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,516
But I swear I see Rivers
pass something to him.

673
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:43,104
A second later, this guy on a motorcycle,
he looks at Cozier.

674
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,148
And then right before he takes off, bam,

675
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,776
the same gesture
the asshole used in the bank.

676
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,029
And then I followed Cozier
and got his license plate number.

677
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,073
Yeah, it's very official. What is that, crayon?

678
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,658
Look, man, I'm telling you, it's him.

679
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,285
Except you can't see his face.
The guy's got a clean sheet.

680
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,829
Come on, man, you follow an ex-con

681
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,832
who's no good for the bank job to,
what, a hot-dog stand?

682
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,000
- Then he meets somebody...
- Listen to me.

683
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,376
Maybe he meets somebody there,
maybe he doesn't.

684
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,045
- Maybe he passes something...
- Look, Hatch, I'm telling you I was there.

685
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,171
...and buys a hot-dog
with ketchup and relish,

686
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,090
- and then, some guy on a motorcycle says...
- Call me crazy.

687
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,341
"So long," and rides off.

688
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,802
Come on, man, give a brother a break.
Are you kidding me?

689
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,555
Can we still go
to the Farmer's Market, Daddy?

690
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,933
Baby, I'm sorry. Geez.

691
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:25,938
I can't believe it's this late.
We can go eat somewhere else.

692
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,525
Just gonna take a few minutes here.
Wherever you want.

693
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,779
Shit.

694
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:38,200
Your daddy loves you very much,
you know that, right?

695
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,704
- Don't ever forget that, okay?
- Okay.

696
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,251
Take care of the real stuff, Jack.

697
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,966
Hey, how about some pizza, huh?

698
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,677
I just wanna go home.

699
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:03,684
Let's go.

700
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,187
Well, when'd it happen?

701
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,317
No, no, no. It's all right.
If she comes back, do me a favor,

702
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,569
you just keep her there, all right, Jimmy,
and you call me.

703
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,572
She doesn't leave the hotel.
Do you understand me?

704
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,324
All right.

705
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,202
Naomi?

706
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,664
I left Jimmy some money at the hotel.
He didn't put it in the safe.

707
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,794
- She took it?
- She's gone and so is the money. Shit!

708
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,006
- What you doing, mate?
- I'm pulling over.

709
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,634
- Why?
- 'Cause you got to find her.

710
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,554
I'll take your time in the tunnel tonight.

711
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,232
- Thanks.
- You got it.

712
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,618
Damn it.

713
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,244
- How's it hanging?
- Funny guy.

714
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,750
All right, come on down.

715
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:35,336
We'll go hot tomorrow morning.

716
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,546
This is gonna be lovely.

717
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,931
Hey, G.

718
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,183
We good?

719
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,684
All signs point to it.

720
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,438
- Any word from Naomi?
- No.

721
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:58,859
This time, I think she's gone.

722
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,653
She'll turn up fine.

723
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,821
What makes you so sure?

724
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,157
If I had any family left, that's where I'd be.

725
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:14,792
You know, if anything goes wrong
tomorrow, we can't let him walk away.

726
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,337
He could still hang us for '04.

727
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,506
I'll bring the insurance.

728
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,217
There he is. How's it going, Ghost?

729
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,885
I can't call it, gentlemen.

730
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,553
- Yeah.
- What's happening?

731
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,180
- G. Cool.
- Yeah, man.

732
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:34,645
Feels good to be back in action again.
It's like old times, huh?

733
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,984
So, where we meeting at after the drop?

734
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,861
Scott's giving me the information.
I'll let you know tomorrow.

735
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,784
"Come sip from the cup of destruction."

736
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:53,664
- Genghis Khan.
- Yeah. One of my heroes.

737
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,293
Saw what he wanted,
reached out and took it.

738
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,253
Like us, tomorrow.

739
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,798
Just like us.

740
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,637
- To tomorrow.
- To tomorrow.

741
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,097
To tomorrow.

742
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,526
Yeah?

743
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:29,408
Slow down, slow down. What?
Where are you?

744
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,455
All right. Wait, no, no, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

745
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,310
Where do I find Processing?

746
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,437
Through the far door. Follow the yellow line.

747
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,570
Where's Vice?

748
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,281
Take the stairs to the basement.

749
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,035
We got your fax last week
about the bank bills,

750
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,537
so when we nailed this scum
with a bunch of fresh hundreds,

751
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,955
thought we'd call you.

752
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,707
This low-life? You gotta be kidding me.

753
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,335
He was hustling some stolen shit
with his girlfriend when we stopped him.

754
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,421
None of the bills were marked, but we figure
they gotta be from some job.

755
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,714
Did you question him?

756
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,800
No. He didn't go easy.

757
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,719
He's high as hell, too.
We decided to let him chill.

758
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:34,181
All right. Let me talk to this guy.

759
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:41,897
All right, I don't have time for this bullshit.
Where did you get the bills?

760
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,151
I got him!

761
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,696
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Where did you get the bills?

762
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:52,199
- It was a loan, man, it was a loan!
- A loan. Bullshit!

763
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,413
I want a name. Give me a name.

764
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,498
- Naomi.
- Naomi what?

765
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:05,629
- Naomi what? She got a last name?
- I don't know, man! I just met her.

766
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,755
You bust her, too?

767
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,633
Yeah, her name's Naomi Cozier.

768
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:13,512
Cozier? Did you hear that, Hatch?

769
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,597
Yeah.

770
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:19,435
I ain't going back to no hotel
to sit on my own.

771
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,061
Right, you ain't going back to the hotel,

772
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,147
you ain't going
to the freaking Caribbean either.

773
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,399
You're going back to the rehab
to start your program again.

774
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,317
- Hell, no, I ain't!
- Yes, you are!

775
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,112
I'm tired of them nurses and doctors
making you stand up

776
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,613
and chat your business in front of strangers.

777
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:36,743
Every time, you do the same thing!
Every time! Two days out of rehab!

778
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,288
Just two days
and you're in the police station already.

779
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,248
Where's the money I gave you?
Is it in your veins?

780
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:43,125
You know, your problem is
you're too into my shit.

781
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,419
Let me see your arm. Your shit.
You're not into your own shit!

782
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,463
Why don't you get a life?
You don't care about me.

783
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,089
You wouldn't even let me stay
at your apartment.

784
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,800
- That's right.
- You're ashamed of me. And I raised you!

785
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,303
You raised me?
My crackhead sister raised me?

786
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,638
- Can't even raise yourself.
- You ungrateful bastard!

787
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,557
- Shut up.
- But you ain't worth shit, man.

788
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,559
- I should've let Welfare take you!
- You're right, you're right.

789
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,810
Wonder.

790
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,604
Naomi!

791
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:09,109
No! Naomi! Naomi!

792
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,579
Gordon Cozier.
Signed for her 20 minutes ago.

793
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,501
- Second time in two days.
- Yeah, I hear you.

794
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:29,755
Even if we tie those bills to a certain job,
it doesn't prove Cozier did anything.

795
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,466
Question him now, he lawyers up,
splits town. We can blow this case.

796
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,093
If we can put him in the elevators
on the day of the heist,

797
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,262
we'll have plenty to talk to him about.

798
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,399
It's time. Let's go, Casanova.

799
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,569
I'll see you tonight.

800
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,113
You be careful.

801
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,158
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

802
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:03,288
Come on, lover boy! Let's go, mate!

803
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,629
Got a job to do, baby. Come on.

804
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,887
Let's go, let's go!

805
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,161
You want a coffee? Donut? Anything?

806
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,830
Naw. I'm okay.

807
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:48,500
Hey, Jack. Carver wants to see you.

808
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,420
Not now, Max.
We're getting close on this FedCal job.

809
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,380
It's not a request, Detective Welles.

810
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,510
Orders, Jack.

811
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:01,513
All right.

812
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,346
This is chicken shit, Chief.

813
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,682
The Haitian, the Russians.
I make judgment calls every day.

814
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,851
- The union says I get an attorney...
- Before you go on about this,

815
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,227
- you need to...
...just like the assholes

816
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,562
- I gotta deal with out there.
- Jack, stop!

817
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:54,775
Look, if you still want to see a lawyer
in five minutes, you can have one.

818
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,570
Sit down.

819
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:06,828
<i>Get down! Get on the ground!</i>
<i>Get on the ground! Spread your legs!</i>

820
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,413
<i>- Keep your head down.</i>
- The day you busted the Haitian,

821
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,249
Narcotics had surveillance set up
in the building across the street.

822
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,168
<i>- Shut up! Stay down!</i>
<i>- I said they'd give you money!</i>

823
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,961
<i>- What? What money?</i>
<i>- Money, right there!</i>

824
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:19,383
<i>Stay there, don't move! All right.</i>
<i>All right, get out of here. Go.</i>

825
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:42,489
Turn it off. All right, turn it off.

826
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,199
I wanted you to know
who you were working with.

827
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:47,494
Felt I owed you that much.

828
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:50,789
Internal Affairs is bringing charges.
Papers are being drawn up today.

829
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,833
You wanna drop Hatcher? I understand.

830
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,546
No, no. No. No.

831
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,553
How'd it go?

832
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,930
You know, same old, same old.

833
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,266
Shouldn't have roughed up that drug dealer,
you know?

834
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,601
- That's the beef? That's it?
- Yeah.

835
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,520
Warning, short and sweet.

836
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:18,483
Check it out. That's our guy. We got him.

837
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:22,446
Time to turn up the heat on Mr. Cozier.
Let's go pay him a visit.

838
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:35,000
All right, we're hot. Ready to rock, man.

839
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,334
All right. Kill the traffic light.

840
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,970
Let's go.

841
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,015
Officer on duty.

842
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:53,685
All right, Officer.
Package is due in five minutes.

843
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,147
Crow's nest. Put an eye on him.

844
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,273
Copy that.

845
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,074
You're driving.

846
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:10,368
Come on, let's go!

847
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,964
Come on, man. What's wrong with you?

848
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,638
Why'd you do it, Eddie?

849
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,018
Why'd you take the money?

850
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,896
What are you... What are you talking about?

851
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,733
They got it on tape.

852
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:46,738
Why'd you do it?

853
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:49,741
Shit, man.

854
01:03:54,956 --> 01:04:00,669
Monica's laid off. We got a mortgage.
Insurance doesn't pay shit.

855
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,422
All these medical bills.

856
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,759
You gotta help me, Jack.

857
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:13,557
It was right there.
It was right there, and I took it.

858
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,101
Why didn't you come to me?

859
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:19,646
I'm Eddie's godfather.

860
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,400
Come on. You're like my brother.

861
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:26,069
The kind of money I'm talking about,
you couldn't save it in a lifetime.

862
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:35,036
Look, you've had my back
for the last six years.

863
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:39,040
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to help you,
okay?

864
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,211
Yeah.

865
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,225
Package is late.

866
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:01,479
Must've gotten hung up. They'll be here.
Goddamn! Get off my ass.

867
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,107
This is not good. This is not good.

868
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:07,277
Let me know, G. I'm ready.

869
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,782
Come on, boys, have some faith.

870
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,701
I never trusted this guy.
This is bad, we gotta do something.

871
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:15,827
This is LA, man. Nothing runs on time.

872
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,705
Damn all that. We got a shitload of C-4,
and we're live down here. Come on.

873
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:19,748
Just be cool, all right?

874
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,875
Where the hell is it, Ghost?
Talk to me. Where is it?

875
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,835
<i>They're coming, God damn it.</i>
<i>They'll be here.</i>

876
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:25,587
Say the word, G. I'll send it.

877
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:28,840
<i>Y'all need to relax. I told you they coming.</i>
<i>Damn!</i>

878
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:30,800
G, we gotta make a move. Come on, man.

879
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:31,885
All right!

880
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:34,971
Where you at, John?

881
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:39,351
I know you up there, son of a bitch.

882
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,520
<i>Well? Is there anDhing?</i>

883
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,357
Nada. If he bolts, this may be
our last shot, right now.

884
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,194
- G.
<i>- Everybody, stay sharp.</i>

885
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,947
<i>They'll be here, G.</i>
<i>Theyjust running a little behind.</i>

886
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,698
We gotta do something. Come on.

887
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,910
Come on, bitch. Where are you?

888
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:00,956
Take him out.

889
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,509
They're here! They're here, God damn it!
I told you they were coming!

890
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,052
All right, hold up, hold up!

891
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:15,720
<i>Buckle up, boys!</i>

892
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,473
<i>They're turning down the ramp now.</i>

893
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:20,141
Train's about to leave the station.

894
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:27,691
<i>A'ight, G. Here they come.</i>

895
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,736
<i>Merging onto 4th.</i>

896
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,706
God damn it. You kidding me?

897
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,418
What's the holdup?

898
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:51,339
Come on, guys, I'm holding traffic.
Just give me the word.

899
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,591
All right, boys, we've still got cars
inside the cones here.

900
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,343
All right, keep me posted.

901
01:06:57,888 --> 01:06:58,888
Come on.

902
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,307
Come on, already! Yo, what's up?

903
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,853
- Let's go!
- You gonna move this or what?

904
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:07,564
Cones look clear to me. Holla at me.

905
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:09,441
Go on ahead and wave them through,
Officer.

906
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:11,776
Finally!

907
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,280
Where you going?

908
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:22,620
Showtime, boys!

909
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,289
- All right, it's on.
- All right, here we go.

910
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,374
- It's on!
<i>- It's in your hands now!</i>

911
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,169
<i>Let's get paid, man!</i>

912
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:30,628
Fifty yards!

913
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:34,382
Twenty-five yards! Ten yards!

914
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,301
- Look out! Bike!
<i>- Hit it!</i>

915
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,807
Holy shit! Goddamn bicyclist!

916
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,518
Shit!

917
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,228
- Jesus Christ!
- You all right?

918
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,396
Damn it, too soon!

919
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:49,647
<i>I still see the trucks!</i>

920
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,399
We missed! Where is it?

921
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:52,859
- Truck stopped short.
- What's going on?

922
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:54,903
- Shit!
- God damn it, Jake, you went too early.

923
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,154
Shut up, Ghost, shut up!

924
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,740
The street blew up! We're in trouble.
We gotta get out of here!

925
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:00,742
Stay in that truck! We'll get you out of this!

926
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:03,119
- Get out and move that traffic, let's go!
<i>- G, now what?</i>

927
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,246
<i>- What we doing?</i>
- Crow's nest! Where are you, crow's nest?

928
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,581
- Talk to me, talk to me!
- Jake, it's a bust, man.

929
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:07,874
- We gotta get out of here!
- What are we doing, G?

930
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,001
- I can't see shit!
- Follow procedure! Stay in that truck!

931
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,836
- Okay, let's clear this!
- G, call it off!

932
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,296
- No, no, hold on!
- What are y'all doing?

933
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,422
G!

934
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:19,052
Abort! Abort!

935
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:20,970
All hell broke loose up here, man!

936
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:24,766
G!

937
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,268
Let's go, let's go!
We gotta abort this, we gotta abort this!

938
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,270
- Abort, abort!
- Hold on, hold on! I see something up here!

939
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,355
We got a man on the move.

940
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,148
No, Officer, we're aborting this now!

941
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,359
Not yet, God damn it, we got action!

942
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,695
You don't see what I see, G!
Just keep them busy!

943
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,118
What's this crazy son of a bitch doing?

944
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:48,873
Hey!

945
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:54,045
Shit! He just jacked a guard!

946
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,464
Open this door!

947
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,133
We got a vehicular, people!

948
01:08:58,217 --> 01:08:59,592
He in the truck!

949
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:03,888
Crazy son of a bitch is going for it!

950
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,224
He hit the car!

951
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:09,561
Keep it clear down below, boys!

952
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,897
- Shit, man, here he come!
- Here he comes, here he comes!

953
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:18,903
<i>He's ramming the truck!</i>

954
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,740
<i>- Here it come!</i>
- Get out of the way!

955
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:29,455
That's what I'm talking about! Damn!

956
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,875
- Get the jaws, get the jaws!
- Keep them back!

957
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,964
Shit! Little bastard!

958
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,884
Soldier boy done lost his damn mind!

959
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:52,437
Shit! What's he doing?

960
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,105
Our man got a problem here.

961
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:57,984
Hit the guard!

962
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,363
Incoming!

963
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:07,702
Hell, yeah.

964
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:09,495
Take his shit!

965
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,668
I've got you, man. Come on. Got you.

966
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,511
We got it.

967
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,015
<i>All units, 211 on an armored vehicle,</i>
<i>4th and Olive.</i>

968
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:32,560
<i>Repeat, armored vehicle robbery</i>
<i>in progress, 4th and Olive.</i>

969
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,520
4th and Olive. That's them.

970
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:37,774
Turn the car around.

971
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,151
I'm taking you home, Eddie.

972
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:43,780
Come on, turn the car around.
It's a couple blocks away.

973
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,368
- No, man.
- God damn it, man, I'm still a cop!

974
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:49,577
Turn the car around!

975
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,705
All right.

976
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,173
Let's hustle, boys, come on!

977
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,092
Yeah!

978
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:06,219
- Come on!
- Come on, Jake!

979
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:07,428
Go, go, go, go!

980
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,641
Yeah, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

981
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:20,692
Move it, move it!

982
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,791
Look at this.

983
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:40,253
Took a shitload of explosives to do this.

984
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:41,629
- C-4.
- Yeah.

985
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,923
- What do you got?
- We got two down in the hole.

986
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,175
Guard got a look at one of them.

987
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,219
Caucasian male, adult, in his 30s.

988
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,346
I got a sketch artist coming here now
to work with our witness.

989
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:51,889
Jesus Christ.

990
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:55,101
They're long gone!
Sewer tunnels in every direction.

991
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:56,227
Sewer tunnels?

992
01:11:57,062 --> 01:12:00,356
Remember that public works map
we found at the Russian safe house?

993
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:05,653
The burnt fragment? The sewers, explosives.
High-powered weapons.

994
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,155
So the job went down
without our two dead guys?

995
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:10,074
Yeah, well, you remember the map?
There was a subway map at the Russians.

996
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,826
Yeah, you think the sewers
connect to the subway station?

997
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,369
Could be, let's check it out.

998
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:15,955
- What was the closest station circled?
- Pershing Square.

999
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:43,566
Pardon me.

1000
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:52,200
That's him, Hatch! The guy with the gray hat!
From the hot-dog stand!

1001
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:53,618
- Shit!
- Freeze!

1002
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,037
- We have a runner!
- Stop!

1003
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:02,335
Asshole!

1004
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,463
Get out the way, get out the way!

1005
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:06,631
Look out! Look out!

1006
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,717
- Are you crazy?
- Shit!

1007
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:23,648
You all right? Hey! Where you going, pal?

1008
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:25,983
We're in pursuit!

1009
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,568
Headed toward Pershing Square.

1010
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:37,745
He's headed through the park!

1011
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,036
Move. Move. Move.

1012
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:23,416
Get off my car! Hey!

1013
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:38,639
He just left Grand!
He's headed towards the library!

1014
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,284
Yeah, man.

1015
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:03,915
Shit!

1016
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:06,083
Police! Freeze!

1017
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,154
Move!

1018
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:39,992
Move, move, move, move! Get out the way!

1019
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:44,247
Police! Watch out!

1020
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:45,331
- Which way did he go?
- Back there.

1021
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:46,415
- Can we exit this way?
- No.

1022
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,543
- Get out of the way!
- Cover those doors!

1023
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,419
- Move, move, move!
- He went that way.

1024
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:52,213
- He went that way.
- Down the hall.

1025
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,260
Hey!

1026
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:05,726
Move it!

1027
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,020
Hey, hey!

1028
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,996
Get out of my way! Get out of my way!

1029
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,414
Everybody, out!

1030
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:16,881
Come on, Jesse.

1031
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:38,235
Hatch?

1032
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:40,321
Hatch!

1033
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:43,741
Shit!

1034
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:52,625
Hold on, buddy. Just hold on. Jesus.

1035
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:55,670
- The son of a bitch was fast.
- This is unit 14.

1036
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:58,631
I got an officer down.
Sixth floor, Monroe building.

1037
01:17:58,715 --> 01:18:00,257
I need immediate assistance.

1038
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,055
Freeze!

1039
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:20,986
He's outside!

1040
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:31,997
Come on, come on.
Just keep breathing, buddy.

1041
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:34,333
Keep breathing. Come on, stay with me.

1042
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,850
I need that crash unit fast! Now!

1043
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:52,643
Come on, buddy. Hang in there.

1044
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:06,657
We lost him!

1045
01:19:07,325 --> 01:19:10,828
Line of duty, Jack. Line of duty.

1046
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,788
Yeah, come on. Come on.
You just keep breathing.

1047
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:15,040
You gotta make it, man. Come on.
Look at me, look at me.

1048
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:20,504
My family, man. Monica.
You take care of Eddie.

1049
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:22,840
I'm gonna take care of your family.
Don't worry about that.

1050
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,259
They're gonna be taken care of.
You just keep breathing.

1051
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,261
- Come on.
- Tell Monica I love her.

1052
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,097
- I will.
- Tell her I love her.

1053
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:33,309
Come on, buddy. Hang in there.

1054
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,329
It's me.

1055
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:59,251
I know who it is. I watch news.
You think I'm stupid, you punk bitch?

1056
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:03,964
Hey, cool it, brother.
I sense a little too much hostility.

1057
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,716
I was just trying to make everybody...

1058
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,969
I give you dispatcher, and you do job
with somebody else!

1059
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,638
Two of my men dead. I kill you!

1060
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:14,183
You do not wanna kill me. If I'm dead,
how am I gonna get you half the money?

1061
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:16,894
You do want the money, don't you?

1062
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:20,648
<i>You listening now? Thought so.</i>

1063
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:26,904
Hey, we meeting at the Roosevelt Hotel.
I'm gonna convince them to give you half.

1064
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,240
<i>I'll call you later with the room number.</i>

1065
01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:50,594
We're all real sorry, Jack.
I just spoke with his wife.

1066
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:57,309
What about the surveillance tape?
His family?

1067
01:20:57,394 --> 01:21:00,271
Forget the tape.
He was killed in the line of duty.

1068
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,314
He'll get a cop's burial and full benefits.

1069
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:04,775
Good. Thanks.

1070
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:12,408
You were making headway
with FedCal Bank. Was it them?

1071
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,120
I don't know.
Guy started running, we chased him.

1072
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:21,000
Eddie got shot. I got nothing.

1073
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:27,172
You okay, Jack?

1074
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,634
Yeah. I'm fine.

1075
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:46,984
- Jake? You heard from Jesse?
- No, not yet.

1076
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:50,321
$19.3 million, so far.
Easily the biggest lick yet, gentlemen.

1077
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,823
<i>Witnesses report...</i>

1078
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,909
I can feel it, man. Something's not right.

1079
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:58,329
This is my fault, man.
I should've never brought him in.

1080
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:00,164
- Hey, Ghost?
- Yes, sir?

1081
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,043
Yeah.

1082
01:22:05,128 --> 01:22:07,171
That's the account card for the '04 job.

1083
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:11,467
That's $250,000 for the Russians.

1084
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,094
That puts us even now, Ghost.

1085
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:16,555
Say what, Rahway?

1086
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,390
You heard me. That puts us even.

1087
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:22,978
Yeah, a'ight. My plan, your command.

1088
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,065
I knew I could trust y'all.

1089
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:34,365
Who is it?

1090
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,410
It's him. Where you been? I been calling you!

1091
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,245
- Police chased me.
- Police? Where?

1092
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,456
You brought them here?
Jesse, you brought them here?

1093
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,582
No. I shot one of them.

1094
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:44,667
- What?
- What?

1095
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:46,919
- Hold on! You shot a cop?
- I had to, man.

1096
01:22:47,003 --> 01:22:48,212
- Where the money?
- I stashed it.

1097
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,130
- You left the money? Damn!
- Goddamn!

1098
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,967
Stashed it? Hold, hold on! Everyone,
hold on. What happened, Jesse? Talk to me.

1099
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:55,511
At the subway station, there was two cops.

1100
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:58,180
And they just started chasing me.

1101
01:22:58,264 --> 01:23:00,641
And they chased you
out the crowd because of what?

1102
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:01,767
How, how the hell am I supposed to know?

1103
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:03,811
- Why?
- Ghost. Hold on.

1104
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:05,104
- Hold on! Hold on!
- No, man, let him tell me why!

1105
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:06,897
- So, what happened? You shot because?
- I don't know!

1106
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,357
- I had to. He had me...
- Why'd you shoot him?

1107
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:09,733
'Cause you stupid.

1108
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,986
I had no choice!
He had me. He had me cold, man.

1109
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:15,698
But he never fired at me.
It was... It was kind of like...

1110
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:16,991
Like what?

1111
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:18,867
Like he wanted me to shoot him.

1112
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:20,953
Stupid ass!

1113
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:23,998
Shit! I'll beat the shit out of you.

1114
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,499
- G! G! Wait!
- Let him go! Let him go!

1115
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:26,583
Get off me! Yo, cool it.
Get your hands off me!

1116
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:28,210
- Back off! Back off!
- You understand what you just did?

1117
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:29,795
- It wasn't my fault!
- You don't shoot cops!

1118
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:30,921
I'll deal with it! Let him go!

1119
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,089
You deal with it then, Jake!

1120
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:34,842
That's a death sentence, young blood,
and I ain't going with you.

1121
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:36,260
Nice one, Jesse.

1122
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:57,406
Still taking passengers tonight?

1123
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,366
Van Nuys Airport, 8:30.

1124
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:03,495
Look, with everything that happened
today, nothing personal,

1125
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,539
I'll take care of your finances
and then I'm out.

1126
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:08,125
- Okay.
- Fair enough.

1127
01:24:11,671 --> 01:24:14,381
<i>I'm standing about a block away</i>
<i>from the Monroe office building</i>

1128
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,050
<i>in downtown Los Angeles</i>

1129
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:20,429
<i>where an LAPD detective</i>
<i>was shot and killed about an hour ago.</i>

1130
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:27,728
Right on time.

1131
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,147
<i>Witnesses describe...</i>

1132
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:33,400
So, Jesse, how'd it feel
losing that money, shooting that cop?

1133
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:35,069
- Ghost. Easy.
- What?

1134
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:36,653
<i>Now, we can't confirm,</i>
<i>at this hour, but the suspect...</i>

1135
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,572
Ghost, we ain't gotta act
like we friends anymore, do we?

1136
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:41,450
Hey, business is business. Money is money.

1137
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:42,910
I never said we were friends.

1138
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:46,121
- Now, me and Lilli, however.
- Come here! You wanna...

1139
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:49,041
Hey! Take it easy! Hey, Jake, Jake, Jake!

1140
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:52,002
Hey, come on, take it easy!
He's not worth it, all right?

1141
01:24:53,004 --> 01:24:55,214
All right, let's get the fellas
and get out of here.

1142
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,228
I'm here. Which room?

1143
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:12,689
1116. A'ight.

1144
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:25,202
<i>Hey, Welles, where you at? You got a 20?</i>

1145
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:29,248
Come on, man, I know you're out there.
Pick up.

1146
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,376
<i>We're worried about you. Where you...</i>

1147
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:37,840
All right, fellas, we're good.
We're out of here.

1148
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:40,676
So, here's the deal.
Anyone wants to fly with...

1149
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,678
- Where's Ghost?
- In the bathroom.

1150
01:25:42,762 --> 01:25:43,762
Get Ghost for me.

1151
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,765
Tonight, Scott, 8:30, Van Nuys Airport,
all right?

1152
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,809
Plane's ready. Bring your passports,
your bags, and your guns.

1153
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:50,269
Ghost? Hey!

1154
01:25:50,353 --> 01:25:52,312
If you need anything,
make sure you give us a call.

1155
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:54,398
What's he doing, taking a shower?
What's going on in here?

1156
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:57,234
- What was that?
- Shower's on.

1157
01:25:58,027 --> 01:25:59,153
Hey, he's gone!

1158
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:01,113
- I told you! I told you!
- What?

1159
01:26:01,197 --> 01:26:02,197
- I don't know about this.
- Damn!

1160
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:03,323
- What are you talking about?
- Where'd he go?

1161
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,366
- I knew this was a bad idea!
- Damn it!

1162
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:05,617
Let's get out of here, let's get out.

1163
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:07,411
Oh, shit!

1164
01:26:34,772 --> 01:26:36,023
Take out the automatic!

1165
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:40,194
Jesse!

1166
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,792
Hey, Jake, you okay?

1167
01:26:57,879 --> 01:27:02,549
Get up, man, get up! Come on, buddy!
Come on, man, come on!

1168
01:27:03,134 --> 01:27:05,344
- Out the back!
- Jesse, Jake, let's go!

1169
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:12,392
Come on, let's go!

1170
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:14,811
Go. I'm coming.

1171
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:23,195
Go!

1172
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:26,448
Come on, come on!

1173
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:01,191
Where's A. J? Where's A. J? Where's...

1174
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:12,995
Down, get down!

1175
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:20,460
- Shit! Who are these guys?
- Sounds like Russians!

1176
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,425
Jake! Check the hallway.

1177
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:28,218
Let's put these beds up, let's go!

1178
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:48,864
We got a shotgun in the hallway!

1179
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:11,303
Stay low, stay low!

1180
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:21,021
Shit! I'm out of ammo! I'm out, I'm out!

1181
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:22,606
Where's Jake?

1182
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:31,341
We gotta go, fellas. We gotta go.

1183
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:51,945
Ghost set us up against the Russians.

1184
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:54,739
Son of a bitch, he must've sold them
on the same plan.

1185
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:55,949
That's why they gave him the dispatcher

1186
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:57,826
and that big hurry-up
was just to get us to do the job first.

1187
01:30:57,910 --> 01:31:00,036
- Yeah, and we bought it.
- Yeah, all of it.

1188
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:02,747
Shit, the heat's gonna be coming down now.

1189
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:05,917
I know. See you at the airport.

1190
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:23,852
Lilli? Lilli?

1191
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:42,245
Hold on, baby. Oh, God, baby, get up. Baby.

1192
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:49,085
Oh, my God, baby, wake up. Oh, just...

1193
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:53,006
Goddamn, the money's gone!

1194
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:55,926
Jesse, help me! Help me!

1195
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,275
Ghost. Ghost, I'm gonna kill you. Oh, God.

1196
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:17,948
Jake, we got company.

1197
01:32:21,118 --> 01:32:24,454
Jake, we gotta go. We have to go.

1198
01:32:26,832 --> 01:32:31,002
Oh, God. Ghost.

1199
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:10,542
<i>Los Angeles Police Department.</i>
<i>Exit the building slowly.</i>

1200
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:12,544
<i>You have 20 seconds to come out.</i>

1201
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:30,353
Look, Jake. I was wrong about Ghost.

1202
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:33,898
I'm sorry, man.

1203
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:36,026
It's not your fault.

1204
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:47,329
Jesse, you ain't gotta be down with me
on this one.

1205
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:50,540
You got your own life to think about, man.

1206
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:54,377
I already told you. I'm never going back.

1207
01:33:55,671 --> 01:33:57,255
And this is my life.

1208
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:01,426
My car's out back. Where's yours?

1209
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:04,804
In front.

1210
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:08,391
Let's take yours.

1211
01:34:09,226 --> 01:34:10,352
Thought you'd say that.

1212
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:13,605
You ready, bro?

1213
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:20,612
Just me and you, big brother. Let's go.

1214
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:00,754
- Naomi.
- G!

1215
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:02,589
- What are you doing? Come here.
- G!

1216
01:36:02,673 --> 01:36:04,466
What are you doing? Are you all right?

1217
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:07,260
- They won't let me in your building.
- We've gotta go.

1218
01:36:07,344 --> 01:36:09,095
Come on, let's get in the car. All right.

1219
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,680
- Just wanna go home.
- All right.

1220
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:59,062
There you are.

1221
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:05,819
- Talk to me.
- I'm almost to the airport.

1222
01:37:05,903 --> 01:37:06,903
Yeah, me, too.

1223
01:37:07,029 --> 01:37:08,822
Hey, I'm tripping.
Hear me out right quick, all right?

1224
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:10,240
Yeah, what's up?

1225
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:11,658
Ghost has had the jump on us
from the get-go, right?

1226
01:37:11,742 --> 01:37:13,576
So, why would he take us all out

1227
01:37:14,745 --> 01:37:16,788
and then only settle for the cash
from the '04 job?

1228
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:19,541
- He wouldn't.
- Unless...

1229
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:23,044
- Man, he plans on taking all the money.
- Shit, Scott. Scott has all the money.

1230
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:25,088
Exactly. I'm on my way. I'm right behind you.

1231
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:33,555
I know this is a little last-minute.
Have him meet me at the bank.

1232
01:37:37,017 --> 01:37:40,270
Come on, Scott, pick up. Scott, pick up.

1233
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:42,021
Yeah, I'm coming in tonight.

1234
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:44,732
You have to make yourself available
at 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow, all right?

1235
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:46,192
Can you do that?

1236
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:47,610
<i>You've reached Scott. I'm away from my cell.</i>

1237
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:50,196
Oh, God. No, Scott, pick up. Damn it.

1238
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:54,576
All right.

1239
01:37:57,037 --> 01:37:58,663
Okay. Let's get out of here.

1240
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:04,794
It's been a long day.
Can you pour me a Scotch?

1241
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:30,528
Yeah, where are you going? You just
had to have it all, didn't you, Ghost?

1242
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:32,822
- I'm just taking what's mine!
- Oh, yeah?

1243
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:34,782
I should've shot you on the street today.

1244
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:37,410
Naw, you should've shot me five years ago
on that fire escape.

1245
01:38:37,494 --> 01:38:40,038
You got caught, Ghost! You got caught!

1246
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:42,165
You knew the game
when you was playing it!

1247
01:38:42,249 --> 01:38:44,292
You left me back there to die like I was shit!

1248
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:45,501
You ain't shit, Ghost!

1249
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:47,045
I helped you put this crew together!

1250
01:38:47,129 --> 01:38:49,088
So what? Now you wanna take it apart?

1251
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:52,342
Drop the weapon! Drop it! Police!
Put them down!

1252
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,053
- Put them down!
- Stay out of this!

1253
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:56,763
- Better listen to him, cop.
- It's between me and him.

1254
01:38:56,847 --> 01:38:59,098
If you interfere, I'm gonna kill you, too.

1255
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:01,017
- Last time, drop them!
- Shit.

1256
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:16,032
What you expect me to do, G? Huh?

1257
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:21,079
You took my money. Took my bitch from me.

1258
01:39:21,163 --> 01:39:23,039
Just put me out the crew, huh?

1259
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:28,211
What you thought I was gonna do?
Let that shit go?

1260
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:29,420
You got caught!

1261
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:33,967
Yeah. A'ight. I see now.

1262
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,636
It's all business for you.

1263
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:39,722
Well, this shit just got real personal.

1264
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:55,571
- Should've waited for me, G.
- The shit went too fast.

1265
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:57,031
Hold, hold it, hold it, hold it.

1266
01:39:57,116 --> 01:39:59,826
Don't move! Don't you move!

1267
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:13,423
You're that cop with the little girl.

1268
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:16,801
You should've stayed out of this.

1269
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:20,888
- Let's get that money and get out of here.
- Yeah.

1270
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:56,007
<i>Emergency dispatch.</i>

1271
01:40:56,091 --> 01:40:57,800
Yeah.

1272
01:40:57,885 --> 01:41:03,639
You got an officer down.
Van Nuys Airport, hangar 12.

1273
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:08,394
I've been shot and I need help.

1274
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:10,480
<i>Units en route.</i>

1275
01:41:12,691 --> 01:41:13,775
I want help.

1276
01:41:24,995 --> 01:41:27,622
G? Are we going home now?

1277
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:35,171
Yeah, baby. We're going home.

1278
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:39,383
Are we good, brother?

1279
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:43,346
All signs point to it.

1281
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,145
