2
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:51,759
Yes, well, the first time
I ever heard that name...

3
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:54,511
Clouseau was just a little nobody.

4
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,099
A police officer in some little village
far outside of Paris.

5
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,187
He was the village idiot
as far as I could tell.

6
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,341
Idiot, pull up.

7
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:44,812
Monsieur Dumont, you must
move your vehicle immediately.

8
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:47,189
I am so sorry, Officer Clouseau.

9
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,109
My chair, it won't move.

10
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,570
Here's your problem.

11
00:01:53,737 --> 00:01:56,699
Your battery cable has come undone.
Let me help.

12
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:59,952
Let's see.
The positive to the negative.

13
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,746
The negative to the positive. There.

14
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:05,958
All right, you are ready to go.

15
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:14,383
All clear, keep it moving.

16
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,052
As chief inspector
of the Police Nationale...

17
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,390
I hear many stories
of our officers in the field.

18
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:24,727
Clouseau generated many...

19
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,520
many stories.

20
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,232
You are under arrest
for the murder of Pierre Fuquet.

21
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:34,486
You are under arrest
for the murder of Pierre Fuquet.

22
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:38,866
You are under arrest
for the murder of Pierre Fuquet.

23
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:40,743
Pierre Fuquet?

24
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:43,996
The case is closed.

25
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:47,249
<i>Needless to say...</i>

26
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:52,588
<i>... Clouseau did not qualify
for any advancement whatsoever.</i>

27
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:56,050
I never thought for a moment
I would have any use for him...

28
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:58,886
until that fateful day.

29
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:03,974
<i>It was a perfect day for a murder.</i>

30
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:08,645
<i>France against China, with the winner
advancing to the finals.</i>

31
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:13,942
<i>I had been invited, as chief inspector
of the Police Nationale.</i>

32
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:17,988
<i>And because of my recent nomination
for the Medal of Honor.</i>

33
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:21,533
<i>I have been nominated seven times.</i>

34
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:24,119
I have never won.

35
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:28,582
But still, seven nominations...

36
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:30,334
that's something.

37
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,547
<i>Anyway, the coach of
the French team, Yves Gluant...</i>

38
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:39,176
<i>... came out
for his customary ovation.</i>

39
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:44,723
<i>He raised his fist to the crowd.</i>

40
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,141
<i>On it:</i>

41
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:48,310
<i>The Pink Panther diamond.</i>

42
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:58,237
<i>It was quite the symbol of pride
and victory for the French team.</i>

43
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,740
<i>Gluant's girlfriend at that time...</i>

44
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:05,703
<i>... was Xania,
the international pop star.</i>

45
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:09,039
<i>They had been having
quite a stormy affair.</i>

46
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,070
<i>By the end of regulation time
the score was tied...</i>

47
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:44,283
<i>... and the game
went into sudden death.</i>

48
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,745
<i>For a patriotic Frenchman
and a true fan like myself...</i>

49
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:51,749
<i>... it was almost
too thrilling to believe.</i>

50
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,959
<i>And then...</i>

51
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,503
<i>... the miracle.</i>

52
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,312
Yes! Yeah!

53
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,315
Yes!

54
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,484
Yes!

55
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,294
Yes!

56
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:46,512
<i>And then, in front of a stadium
filled with people...</i>

57
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,306
<i>... Gluant collapsed...</i>

58
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,891
<i>... dead.</i>

59
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,688
<i>A poison dart in his neck.</i>

60
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:59,191
<i>And the Pink Panther diamond...</i>

61
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:03,779
<i>... had disappeared.</i>

62
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:17,514
<i>The newspapers fed on
Gluant's murder with a frenzy.</i>

63
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:20,184
<i>For them, the world had stopped.</i>

64
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,560
<i>For me...</i>

65
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:25,939
<i>... it was an opportunity
for my greatest triumph.</i>

66
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,569
I know what we need
for the Gluant case.

67
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:33,739
- What?
- An incompetent.

68
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:38,744
An unimaginative, by-the-book,
low-level incompetent...

69
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,997
who will plod along,
getting nowhere...

70
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,750
with the media
watching his every step.

71
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,169
And while he is getting nowhere...

72
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,422
I will put together the finest team
of investigators in France...

73
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:53,842
and we will hunt down the killer,
retrieve the Pink Panther diamond...

74
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,262
and then the Medal of Honor
will be mine.

75
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,099
And who is this incompetent?

76
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:05,312
Oh, I think I know
the perfect man for the job.

77
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:10,109
Find him and bring him to Paris.

78
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:14,029
His name is Clouseau.

79
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,067
Good morning, mademoiselle.

80
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:36,362
I'll be right with you.

81
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,743
The minister of justice sent around
a new picture of himself...

82
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,704
but it was bigger than
Chief Inspector Dreyfus' picture.

83
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,040
So the chief inspector
had a larger one made.

84
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,710
You'll find that Paris
can be a very political place.

85
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,839
Yes, politics. Where greed
wears the mask of morality.

86
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,676
That's good. Did you say that?

87
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,930
Yes, I did.

88
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:06,684
- Could you help me down?
- Oh, yes, of course.

89
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:13,691
Oh, yes. Here, just... Perhaps...

90
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,776
- Yes, I...
- All right.

91
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,153
- Wait.
- Yeah.

92
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,532
Don't jump. Yes, that's good.
All right.

93
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,993
I think if you put
your leg right there...

94
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,871
- Okay.
- Yes. Okay.

95
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,916
Yes.

96
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,920
- I can't see anything.
- Maybe over here?

97
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,172
- Yes, okay.
- Okay.

98
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,383
Over here.

99
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,849
The inspector will see you now.

100
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,893
He'll be right with you.

101
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,773
Clouseau.

102
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,192
- Clouseau.
- He's coming in.

103
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,778
Good.

104
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,119
Officer Jacques Clouseau,
gendarme, third class.

105
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:22,134
- That had to hurt.
- No. No, not at all. No.

106
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,511
Clouseau, the reason
we called you here...

107
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,266
It is lovely weather we are having.

108
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:34,688
I hope the weather continues.

109
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,405
The area is secure.

110
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,199
Oh, thank you.

111
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,494
Clouseau, I have reviewed
your records, and it is clear to me...

112
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,247
that a man of your talent
merits greater responsibility...

113
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,208
than you have had
up to this point.

114
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,670
I have decided to promote you
to inspector...

115
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:01,340
the highest rank of any officer
in the republic.

116
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,092
- Inspector?
- Exactly.

117
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,969
And your first case
is the Gluant murder...

118
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,555
and theft of
the Pink Panther diamond.

119
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,140
- I am honored.
- Good.

120
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,143
Jacques Clouseau,
by the power vested in me...

121
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,773
I hereby appoint you
full inspector...

122
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,858
with all of the...

123
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,285
Here, if you would be so kind,
please.

124
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,538
Oh, here, take my pen.

125
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,499
Thank you.

126
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,588
One does not often see
the traditional French fountain pen.

127
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,054
I will cherish this forever.

128
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,932
No. It is not a gift.

129
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,977
That was given to me
by the mayor of Paris.

130
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,146
Well, then...

131
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:58,731
I cannot accept this.

132
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,943
The press conference.

133
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,780
Yes. Clouseau, there is
a press conference...

134
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,908
in just a few minutes
down the hall...

135
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,744
to introduce you to the media.

136
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,204
We'll meet you there.
And, Clouseau?

137
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,789
Yes?

138
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,791
Good luck.

139
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,085
Good luck to you.

140
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,713
And where is the press conference?

141
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,715
Go under the arch...

142
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:27,676
through the door on the right
and down the hall.

143
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,097
Well...

144
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:39,646
The area is still secure.

145
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,733
Thank you.

146
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,738
He's perfect.

147
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,992
Yes, we have definitely
found our man.

148
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,952
Why do I feel wet?

149
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,622
Because of the unique nature
of the crime...

150
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,833
we have brought in a man
specially suited to the case:

151
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,961
Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

152
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,843
Inspector.

153
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,804
Inspector.

154
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,641
- Yes?
- Yes, what's your initial premise?

155
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,352
That Gluant did not
want to be killed.

156
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,730
Everything else follows
like liquid mercury...

157
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,733
flowing down a... A...

158
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,945
A sloping thing.

159
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,781
How long do you think
it will take to find the killer?

160
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:34,660
Right now the killer is being
surrounded by a web of deduction...

161
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,997
forensic science
and the latest in technology...

162
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,500
such as two-way radios
and e-mail.

163
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:46,588
Assign a man to be his driver who can
report on his whereabouts at all times.

164
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,757
What kind of man?

165
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,928
A man who follows orders
and doesn't ask questions.

166
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,724
Inspector, do you know if the killer
was a man or a woman?

167
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,686
Well, of course I know that.
What else is there? A kitten?

168
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,771
Excuse me,
do you think it's possible...

169
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,107
that the killer could be
watching you now?

170
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,985
Well, if I was a killer,
I would certainly be watching...

171
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,320
and possibly taping
for later playback...

172
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,575
because, you know, it's a big deal
to be talked about on TV.

173
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,910
But I have a message for the killer:

174
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,830
There is no place you can hide.

175
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,958
There is no place
you cannot be seen.

176
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,128
<i>Killer, I will find you...</i>

177
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,630
<i>... because I am
a servant of the nation.</i>

178
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,175
<i>Because justice is justice...</i>

179
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:35,471
<i>... and because France is France.</i>

180
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,237
<i>- Bonjour, Nicole.
- Good morning, inspector.</i>

181
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,281
Welcome to your new office.

182
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,242
You should probably start
by going through these files.

183
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,624
It is lovely weather we are having.

184
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,754
I hope the weather...

185
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,382
stays this mild.

186
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,687
If the weather continues...

187
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:30,693
we are in for a lovely summer.

188
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,491
The area is secure.

189
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,411
- Are you all right?
- Well, of course I'm all right.

190
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,579
And what is that?

191
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,332
- What?
- Nothing.

192
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,629
You should probably start
by looking at these files. You have to...

193
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,100
My leg, it crushed my leg!

194
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,446
Being an inspector,
you'll need some new clothes.

195
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,365
I can take your measurements
and have something sent over.

196
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,242
- Of course.
- Please remove your jacket.

197
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,952
Yes.

198
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,415
- Do you live by yourself, inspector?
- Yes, I do.

199
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,542
Do you get lonely?

200
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,961
No, not really.
Not since the Internet.

201
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,131
Well, that takes care of that.
And welcome to Paris.

202
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,008
Thank you.

203
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,344
Good morning, monsieur.

204
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,262
And you are?

205
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,890
Gilbert Ponton.
Detective, second class.

206
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,767
I've been assigned to work with you.

207
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,186
What qualifications do you have
for police work?

208
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,980
My family's done police work
in Paris for nine generations.

209
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,692
- And before that?
- We were policemen for 200 years.

210
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,487
- And before that?
- Immigrants from countries in Europe.

211
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,822
- All involved in police work.
- And before that?

212
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,574
Farmers.

213
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,913
So you are a little lamb who has
come to Clouseau for to learn.

214
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,959
Gilbert Ponton, I vow to teach you
everything I know about police work.

215
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,378
And together...

216
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,589
we are going to catch a killer.

217
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,927
There.

218
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,889
The Chinese VIP box,
right on the edge of the kill zone.

219
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:28,185
The poison was Chinese.
Was Gluant ever in China?

220
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,896
Three years ago, he took a group
of French stars there...

221
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,564
for some exhibition games.

222
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,442
Gluant was in China...

223
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,528
the poison is from China...

224
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,738
the Chinese are from China.

225
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:45,077
It may be too early to say for certain,
but I think our killer is Chinese.

226
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,579
Corbeille, I want you
on the next flight to Beijing.

227
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,582
Find out what Gluant did there,
who he saw, where he went.

228
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,920
Pacquette, I want a dossier
on every Chinaman in that box.

229
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,422
Go, go, go, go, go.

230
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,848
Inspector, it's awfully late and...

231
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,851
Oh, I'm just going over
these crime-scene photos.

232
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:12,479
- Don't you need some rest?
- Crime does not rest, Nicole.

233
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,981
It's true.

234
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,858
You see...

235
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,485
I have waited a long time
to prove myself.

236
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,739
And I've been given
the opportunity of a lifetime.

237
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,576
And I intend to show the world
exactly who I am...

238
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:29,038
and what I can do.
I must not fail.

239
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,833
You won't. I know it.

240
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,960
Thank you, Nicole.

241
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,424
- Nicole?
- Yes?

242
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,052
May I be very frank with you?

243
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,845
Of course.

244
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,639
You have put on a ton of weight.

245
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,434
Now, what I do
when I get a little heavy...

246
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,521
Never mind.

247
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,316
Would you like me to stay behind
and help you?

248
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,612
That is a generous offer, Nicole...

249
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,449
but I am quite sensitive
to office gender politics.

250
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,327
And in today's world,
the slightest gesture...

251
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,872
can be misinterpreted
as harassment.

252
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,126
And it is late, and I would prefer
not to put you or me...

253
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,296
into that delicate situation.

254
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,881
Agreed?

255
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,549
Yes, I agree.

256
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:26,303
Well, let's seal it with a kiss.
And I'll get back to work.

257
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,932
I am going to be frank.

258
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,142
Since you are only a detective,
second class...

259
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,478
your senses may not be as sharp
as my own.

260
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,147
And as I do not want a partner
who makes me duller...

261
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,901
I have come up with a plan
to keep you as sharp as possible.

262
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,736
And what is that?

263
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,615
Intermittently, and without warning,
I will attack you...

264
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,451
whenever and wherever
it is least expected.

265
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,414
In this way, I will keep you
vigilant and alert. Agreed?

266
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,582
Yes.

267
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,087
- Good one.
- Thank you.

268
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,881
Here we are.

269
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,432
"Do not open door
when light is flashing."

270
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,411
Excuse me.

271
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,997
Coming through. Thank you.

272
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,759
And I'm wondering if you... Yes.

273
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,387
I'm wondering if you saw, perhaps,
a person yelling.

274
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,682
Stop! Stop, stop!

275
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,144
Who are you,
and what the hell are you doing?

276
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,522
- I'm in the middle of an interrogation.
- The booth is soundproof.

277
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,233
She can't hear a word.
And in case you haven't noticed...

278
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,778
you ruined my recording session.
Now, get out.

279
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,572
Unless you want to be charged
with obstruction of justice...

280
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,407
you will let me interrogate Xania.

281
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,369
It's all right, Roland.
Hello, inspector.

282
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,037
I'm Xania.

283
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:19,208
You do not know this, but I am
intimately familiar with your work.

284
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,127
You are very kind.

285
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,715
Did you say that booth
was soundproof?

286
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,759
Yes.

287
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,700
Now, you were nearby
when Gluant was killed?

288
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,577
Yes, I ran out to be with him
after the team won.

289
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,954
Of course you did.

290
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,456
Now, a few hours
before the murder...

291
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:03,794
six witnesses saw you repeatedly
striking the deceased and screaming...

292
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,337
What was it, Ponton?

293
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,298
"I am going to kill you.
I am going to kill you."

294
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,885
I was angry.
I caught him with another woman.

295
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,304
And this was after
he said he loved me.

296
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,557
You poor little angel waif.

297
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,810
After he cheated on me...

298
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,312
I hated him.

299
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,024
- But I didn't kill him.
- Of course you didn't.

300
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,818
- You recently performed in China...
- Stop browbeating her!

301
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,487
Can't you see she's sexy?

302
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,615
Three months ago in Shanghai.

303
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,244
Can you think of anyone else
who might have hated Gluant?

304
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:40,372
- Bizu.
- The football star?

305
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:44,001
I was dating Bizu when I met Gluant.

306
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,338
He thought Gluant was a bad guy
for stealing me away.

307
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,591
- If you ask me, they were both...
- You, don't leave town.

308
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,719
But I'm flying to Montserrat
to record Rene Duchanel...

309
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:57,014
You will not leave town. I may want
to ask you a few more questions.

310
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,058
But I don't know anything.

311
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:04,063
About life, about love.
Yes, you little wet puppy.

312
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,482
But about the crime
you may know a lot.

313
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,567
Inspector.

314
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,278
Do I have to stay in town?

315
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,197
Because next week
I have something...

316
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,575
vague to do in New York.

317
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,703
Well, if you absolutely have
to do something vague...

318
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,455
feel free to go where you wish.

319
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:45,145
I can't take you to Bizu, but I can
take you to Monsieur Vainqueur...

320
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,773
the team's assistant coach.

321
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,734
Well, I guess he's
the head coach now.

322
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,904
- You wanted to see me?
- You are Vainqueur?

323
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:57,199
Yes. And who are you?

324
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:00,285
I am Inspector Clouseau.
Perhaps you have heard of me.

325
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,787
No.

326
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,789
Don't write that down.

327
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,711
- What do you want?
- I am told that Bizu hated Gluant.

328
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,422
A lot of people hated Gluant.

329
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,257
Did you?

330
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:17,177
I spent six years under his thumb
being verbally abused every day.

331
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,388
Yes, I was not a fan
of Yves Gluant.

332
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,348
And now he is dead...

333
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,475
and you have his job.

334
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,269
Ironic.

335
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,438
Not every death is a tragedy.

336
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:31,817
- And what was the..?
- Footsteps.

337
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,569
It's a young woman...

338
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,863
30 to 35 years old...

339
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,199
5'2", 5'4", brunette.

340
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,618
And she is wearing high heels.

341
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,913
Perhaps a bit too formal
for the afternoon.

342
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,124
And she has on...

343
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,169
Chanel N°5.

344
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,886
- Is anyone with you?
- No.

345
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,680
Do you have a pair of high heels
in that bag?

346
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,850
- No.
- Not even a small pair of pumps?

347
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,436
- No.
- Who are you?

348
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,646
I am Yuri, the trainer.

349
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,524
And what is it you do here,
Yuri the trainer?

350
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,818
I train.

351
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,821
So you are Yuri the trainer
who trains.

352
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:24,119
Do not leave Europe.

353
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,830
But I have to go to Asia.

354
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,957
Okay.

355
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,709
Do not leave Europe or Asia.

356
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,005
We have one match in Brazil.

357
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,423
All right.

358
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,010
Do not leave Europe, Asia
or the Americas.

359
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,848
- Okay.
- Where is this famous soccer player?

360
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,976
He is outside on the practice field.

361
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,730
Well, we shall see about Mr. Bizu.

362
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,783
I've got Bizu
in the interrogation room.

363
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,993
What's the plan?

364
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,496
<i>I'm going to give him the
good-coplbad-cop routine.</i>

365
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,208
You are the soccer player
known as Bizu?

366
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,086
- Yes.
- You were acquainted with Gluant?

367
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,882
- I'm glad he's pushing up daisies.
- He is not pushing up daisies.

368
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,426
He is dead.

369
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,594
It's an idiom.

370
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,348
You, sir, are the idiom.

371
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:29,727
Now, unless you want to spend
the rest of your life in prison...

372
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:33,272
you will answer the next question.
Did you kill him?

373
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,525
I would have loved
to have killed him.

374
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,654
But some lucky bastard
beat me to it.

375
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,907
You disgust me.

376
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,493
I'll be right back.

377
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,750
Cigarette?

378
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,419
No.

379
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,837
Thanks.

380
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,922
Good for you.

381
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,634
Bizu...

382
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,306
I know you didn't do it.

383
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:10,059
Someone else did,
and they are trying to set you up.

384
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:11,810
You'll help me?

385
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,229
Of course I'll help you.

386
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:18,442
Now, do you have any idea who
might have done this terrible thing?

387
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,237
His partner in those
stupid restaurants, Larocque.

388
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:25,532
Raymond Larocque,
the casino owner.

389
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,702
Gluant would steal money from
the restaurants and use it to gamble.

390
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,413
My guess is Larocque got fed up...

391
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,207
and had him killed.

392
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,959
Bizu, I like you.

393
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,087
I'm going to help you.

394
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,465
You and I are going to make
a great team.

395
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,849
<i>The good-coplbad-cop routine
is working perfectly.</i>

396
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:54,395
You know, usually
two different cops do that.

397
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:18,168
You know what we do to prisoners
who don't cooperate?

398
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,504
We hook them up to the box.

399
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,800
What is the box?

400
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:29,346
Idiot. Like this,
I take one electrode...

401
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,432
I put it here.

402
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,686
I take the other one...

403
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:37,062
I put it...

404
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,828
So, what do you think?

405
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,039
Bizu is innocent.

406
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,207
How can you say that?

407
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,210
Gluant suspended Bizu.
He stole his girlfriend.

408
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:04,673
If it were me, I would have killed him
then and there.

409
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,633
That's exactly what Bizu did.

410
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,385
Ponton...

411
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,471
a crime is like a jigsaw puzzle.

412
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,098
You have to have the jig
and you have to have the saw.

413
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,059
You have the jig, but no saw.

414
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,894
Where is your saw?

415
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,356
"Oh, Your Honor, I want to present
a case, but all I have is a jig.

416
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,732
Is that okay?"

417
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,154
What?

418
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:28,822
Nothing.

419
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,449
I thought you said:

420
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,787
No.

421
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,464
Strange.

422
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:02,564
Oh, it's you.

423
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:15,429
I hope you don't mind I let
myself in with the spare key.

424
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:18,182
- Oh, no, no.
- And, look.

425
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,977
I got your pants back from the tailor.

426
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,772
- Plus a spare.
- Good.

427
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,816
- Would you like some water?
- Yes, please.

428
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:35,366
You know, Nicole, this crime
is forcing me to use all my knowledge.

429
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,912
Everything I have learned in a lifetime
of investigating is coming into play.

430
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:43,165
Do you mind if I have these?
I haven't eaten.

431
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,292
Oh, please, go ahead.

432
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:49,963
Things are appearing in my mind
that I did not even realize was there.

433
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,632
And yet the in...

434
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:54,426
Oh, my God. The Heimlich!
The Heimlich!

435
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:14,405
Are you feeling better?

436
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:16,657
Yes, thank you.
You are so good at it.

437
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,075
Where did you learn that?

438
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,953
I used to practice on mannequins,
pillows...

439
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,497
but frankly, it was the expression
on your face...

440
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,541
that told me that you needed it.

441
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,335
Now, Ponton, what do you
have for me?

442
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:32,506
It seems you were right about Bizu.
He was just found dead...

443
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:34,967
in the training facility locker room.

444
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,803
- Shot in the head.
- Was it fatal?

445
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,222
- Yes.
- How fatal?

446
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,349
Completely.

447
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:44,143
I want to talk to him now.

448
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,103
He's dead.

449
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,986
You there. Halt.

450
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,407
You are Yuri the trainer
who trains.

451
00:35:58,574 --> 00:35:59,908
Yeah, that's right.

452
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:03,579
I am looking for a dead body.
Perhaps you can tell me where it is.

453
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:06,415
Oh, yeah. I heard it was
in the locker room.

454
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:10,502
You go down the hall,
make a right and two lefts.

455
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:16,008
You are finding
something amusing here?

456
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:17,801
I'll be honest with you. I...

457
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,137
I find your accent quite funny.

458
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,848
- Where are you from?
- From Russia.

459
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,602
Gluant recruited me
from the Russian military gym.

460
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,564
You need to work on your accent.

461
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,441
- What?
- What?

462
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,568
- What? What?
- What?

463
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,403
- What?
- I don't have time for this.

464
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,821
I have to solve a murder.

465
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,286
Please, tell me what you saw.

466
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:47,206
Well, I didn't see anything.

467
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,583
I was passing by the locker room.

468
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,503
It was late, past time
anyone should be there.

469
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,798
I heard movement on the other side
of the locker-room door.

470
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,342
I heard Bizu say:

471
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:01,720
"Oh, it's you."

472
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:04,848
And then there was gunfire.

473
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,685
Ponton, go to your databases.

474
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:12,481
I want to interrogate every person
in Paris with the name "You."

475
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,025
And, Ponton...

476
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,528
don't you find it
a bit of a coincidence...

477
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:21,949
that the body fell perfectly
within the chalk outline on the floor?

478
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:25,744
I think they drew
the chalk outline later.

479
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,790
We are dealing
with some kind of mastermind.

480
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:33,836
Ponton, I want to interrogate
this man Raymond Larocque.

481
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,671
Where is his casino?

482
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:51,061
Park it close by. Unless you want
to know what else is good for you.

483
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,148
You continue to surprise me,
inspector.

484
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:59,153
Get used to it, Ponton. With me,
surprises are rarely unexpected.

485
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:06,076
Yes, the weather is nice today.
Let's hope it continues.

486
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,495
Ponton, go find security.

487
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:12,124
Tell them I want to converse
with Mr. Raymond Larocque.

488
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,753
- You're not coming?
- Something has come up.

489
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:20,549
If the weather stays this mild,
we are all in for a treat.

490
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:25,387
- Place your bets.
- I am in law enforcement too.

491
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,097
Am I that obvious?

492
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:31,643
No, it's just that I have an ear
for such things.

493
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:34,188
Here is your mojito.

494
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,316
- Flame it.
- No more bets.

495
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,113
Impressive.

496
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,449
I will remember that.

497
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:50,371
I am Inspector Jacques Clouseau.
I am here on a very important case.

498
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,499
Boswell. Nigel Boswell.
Agent 006.

499
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,626
- Know what that means?
- Of course I do.

500
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,378
You are one short of the big time.

501
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:01,298
I, too, am on a very important case,
inspector.

502
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:03,592
So you understand
what I mean when I say...

503
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:06,053
no one must know that I am here.

504
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,847
I have just slipped my
cell-phone number into your pocket.

505
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,518
Call me if you need any help.

506
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,479
I will, inspector.

507
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,450
Well...

508
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:31,495
Monet. Very impressive,
Monsieur Larocque.

509
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:33,205
Very impressive,
Inspector Clouseau.

510
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:35,791
Please make yourself at home.
Now, how can I help you?

511
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:39,003
I am investigating the murder
of Yves Gluant.

512
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:40,879
Yves.

513
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,881
Fascinating man.

514
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:46,760
Would you happen to know
what he paid for the Pink Panther?

515
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:49,138
He inherited it.
It cost him nothing.

516
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,265
It cost him his life.

517
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:56,311
I would like to take a closer look
at your bowls.

518
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,982
- My what?
- Your bowls.

519
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,817
I would like to take a closer look...

520
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:04,278
at your big brass bowls.

521
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:10,659
- Okay.
- Thank you.

522
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,580
Han Dynasty.

523
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:17,541
- Very rare. Beautiful.
- I see you have an eye for antiques.

524
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,419
Some here are real
and some are copies.

525
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,296
I'm sure you can tell
which are which.

526
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:25,215
Second century. Very rare.

527
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:28,802
One should always handle
an antique vase from the inside.

528
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:33,098
Otherwise the oil from the hands
can damage the patina.

529
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,435
Pure alabaster.

530
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:38,145
Lovely.

531
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:48,405
That's odd. What I did,
I went like this, and then...

532
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:58,374
This is weird.

533
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:04,380
Why did you take out
a life-insurance policy on Gluant?

534
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:08,300
The insurance company won't pay
unless the murderer is caught.

535
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,803
And if it turns out to be me...

536
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,263
they won't pay at all.
Do you understand?

537
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,934
But you stood to gain
from Gluant's death, didn't you?

538
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:19,395
Gain? What would I gain?

539
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:22,356
Gluant's share of the restaurants.

540
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:24,650
Oh, the restaurants
were a disaster.

541
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:28,278
Gluant was siphoning money out
faster than it came in.

542
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:32,032
My only consolation was he'd lose
the money gambling in my casino.

543
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:35,077
But after a while his losses
became so ridiculous...

544
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,871
he promised me his ring
as collateral.

545
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:41,000
But someone had words
with Gluant...

546
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,793
the night before he was killed.

547
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:45,796
- Didn't you?
- No.

548
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:50,551
You didn't threaten to break his legs
and then crush him into powder?

549
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:52,177
No.

550
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,139
Perhaps I saw that on TV.

551
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,313
Well, I can certainly think
of a better place for this.

552
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,529
That's my personalized
cell-phone tone ring.

553
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:18,454
Hello?

554
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,122
Yes, this is Inspector...

555
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:23,000
Yes, I could meet you.
In the restaurant?

556
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,210
Yes, of course. Right away.

557
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:29,006
Gentlemen, something has come up.
Please excuse me.

558
00:42:29,173 --> 00:42:30,424
- Monsieur Larocque.
- Yes.

559
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:32,009
Is this vase of great value?

560
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:34,219
It is a worthless imitation.

561
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:35,971
Good.

562
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:40,684
But that desk was...

563
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:42,102
priceless.

564
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:50,152
- Clouseau.
- Oh, yes.

565
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,238
I need your help. Now, it's very
important that you remain calm...

566
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:56,325
and you do not turn around.
- Remain calm. Do not turn around.

567
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:58,786
Behind you in the casino
are the Gas Mask Bandits.

568
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:02,081
Oh, my God!
The Gas Mask Bandits!

569
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:05,209
- All Europe is looking for them.
- How can I help?

570
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:08,253
- Just give me your coat.
- Yes, of course. Why?

571
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,963
I'm not supposed to be here.

572
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,508
But I can't let
the Gas Mask Bandits escape.

573
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:55,134
- Put it on.
- Yes. Yes, of course. But why?

574
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:58,429
I'm not supposed to be here,
remember?

575
00:44:00,014 --> 00:44:01,473
Inspector.

576
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:05,144
My God, man, that was fantastic.

577
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:15,654
Inspector, was Clouseau's plan to set
a trap for the Gas Mask Bandits?

578
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:18,824
Does Clouseau think the Bandits
are connected to the Pink Panther?

579
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:20,701
Is Clouseau
going to be promoted, sir?

580
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:25,122
I cannot comment
on ongoing investigations.

581
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:26,498
Drive.

582
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:29,960
Inspector?

583
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:31,587
Clouseau?

584
00:44:35,466 --> 00:44:36,842
Good one.

585
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:38,510
Thank you.

586
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:40,679
Now, what do you have for me?

587
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:42,931
We have rounded up
all the people in Paris...

588
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:47,019
with the name "You."
- Finally, we are getting somewhere.

589
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:03,535
Read that back.

590
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,667
You may go.

591
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,961
You speak Chinese?

592
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:15,422
What, you don't think
I speak Chinese?

593
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,258
If I don't speak Chinese,
what are we doing here?

594
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:20,552
That must be funny
around the water cooler.

595
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,846
"Oh, Inspector Clouseau
does not speak Chinese.

596
00:45:23,013 --> 00:45:25,474
Let's take him out for lunch.
We will all speak Chinese.

597
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:27,434
He won't know
what we are talking about."

598
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:30,145
Is that what you like to do?
Is that funny?

599
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:32,564
Of course I speak Chinese.

600
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:39,613
Clouseau?

601
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:08,559
<i>Bonjour, Nicole.</i>

602
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:11,228
Could I see you in my office
in a few minutes?

603
00:46:11,437 --> 00:46:14,398
I'll be right with you, inspector.

604
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:43,302
Yes, inspector?

605
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:45,346
Nicole.

606
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:48,807
The weather has been so pleasant.

607
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:54,104
I was wondering if you think
it's going to stay this mild.

608
00:46:55,314 --> 00:46:58,150
I certainly hope so.

609
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:02,571
But do you think the weather...

610
00:47:02,738 --> 00:47:05,282
is going to change?

611
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:07,951
Let's keep our fingers crossed...

612
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,704
that it stays this mild.

613
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:14,291
And here's another one for you!

614
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,753
Now let's see who you are.

615
00:47:19,672 --> 00:47:22,091
It is "Inspector Dreyfus."

616
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:24,885
The intruder is obviously wearing
a flesh mask.

617
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:26,553
But that will come off.

618
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,432
My face!

619
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,147
Maybe there is a seam
under your hairline.

620
00:47:37,356 --> 00:47:39,233
I'll just turn you around.

621
00:47:46,365 --> 00:47:49,493
Are you feeling any better?
I am so sorry, inspector.

622
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:52,079
Let's just forget it.

623
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:55,666
I thought I would stop by and let you
know how we are doing on the case.

624
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:58,210
Oh, I'll just...

625
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:01,547
stay back here.
- Yes, of course.

626
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,009
I see you have one
of these collapsible pointers.

627
00:48:05,175 --> 00:48:06,385
So very useful.

628
00:48:06,552 --> 00:48:09,388
It is so degrading to have to point
with your finger...

629
00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:11,724
or one of those
long wooden sticks...

630
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,685
like you are some sort
of primitive oaf.

631
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:19,898
But you have one of these, you just
snap it open and you are ready to go.

632
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:21,900
The case. The case, Clouseau.

633
00:48:22,234 --> 00:48:24,445
Yes, the case.

634
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:28,615
The case is going quite well.
I have prepared a list of suspects.

635
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:31,744
And how many suspects
do you have?

636
00:48:32,286 --> 00:48:34,747
Twenty-seven thousand
six hundred eighty-three.

637
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:38,709
It's just a matter of time now,
isn't it?

638
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:42,254
- Have you eliminated any suspects?
- Yes.

639
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,131
One.

640
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:46,800
One. And who would that be?

641
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,011
Gluant.

642
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,431
Gluant is the victim.

643
00:48:53,057 --> 00:48:55,267
Excellent, inspector.

644
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:57,436
We think alike.

645
00:48:57,936 --> 00:49:02,232
One clue leading inexorably
to the next.

646
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:05,569
Just leave it.

647
00:49:07,905 --> 00:49:09,365
I assure you, inspector...

648
00:49:09,782 --> 00:49:13,160
I will soon have your criminal
cornered like a...

649
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:15,829
Like a... Like... Like a... Like...

650
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:19,083
Like something...
Something that you... You corner.

651
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:22,586
- Well put.
- I see you enjoy wordplay.

652
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:24,421
We will have to have lunch
one day...

653
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,841
and engage
in a little verbal jousting.

654
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:30,969
I'm sure you're quite the raconteur.

655
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:35,182
Yes.

656
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:39,311
So I will call you for lunch.

657
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:46,193
There's only one item
on the agenda of this committee:

658
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,990
To approve the list of nominees
for our nation's highest award...

659
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:52,658
the Medal of Honor.

660
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:55,119
The two nominees are...

661
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:56,912
Charles Dreyfus...

662
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,874
No.

663
00:50:02,626 --> 00:50:04,795
and Sister Marie-Hugette...

664
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:08,716
whose selfless concern
for our nation's orphans...

665
00:50:08,882 --> 00:50:11,301
is an inspiration to us all.

666
00:50:11,468 --> 00:50:14,847
I would like to add one more name
for the committee's consideration.

667
00:50:15,014 --> 00:50:18,517
Inspector Jacques Clouseau, the man
who came here from a small village...

668
00:50:18,684 --> 00:50:20,811
to investigate the murder
of Yves Gluant...

669
00:50:20,978 --> 00:50:24,189
who just last night captured
the notorious Gas Mask Bandits.

670
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:27,359
Yes. Interesting idea.

671
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:30,279
- An average Frenchman.
- Exactly.

672
00:50:30,446 --> 00:50:32,323
Excellent idea.

673
00:50:32,489 --> 00:50:34,700
All in favor?

674
00:50:34,867 --> 00:50:38,287
How is it I was not informed
of Clouseau's going to that casino?

675
00:50:38,454 --> 00:50:41,999
- It was the middle of the night.
- Oh, it was the middle of the night.

676
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:44,376
What, you did not want to wake me?

677
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:46,462
I want to know
of Clouseau's whereabouts...

678
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:48,922
every hour, 24 hours a day.

679
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:51,759
You miss one call, and I will have
you kicked off the force.

680
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:54,470
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

681
00:50:54,636 --> 00:50:57,056
Why are you not with him now?

682
00:50:57,222 --> 00:51:00,559
- I'm here.
- Get out.

683
00:51:03,604 --> 00:51:05,898
- Clouseau.
- Ponton.

684
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:08,484
Let's call it a day. I am tired.

685
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:11,528
I just wanted to see where you are
with the investigation.

686
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:14,114
Good idea, Ponton.
To let the subconscious mind...

687
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:17,242
work on the case while we sleep.
Now then, what are the facts?

688
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:18,702
Yves Gluant was found...

689
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:21,205
at the international championship
semifinal...

690
00:51:21,372 --> 00:51:24,083
with a poison dart in his neck.
- The crime!

691
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:27,044
Bizu wanted to kill him,
but is now himself dead.

692
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:28,712
A complication!

693
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:30,339
Gluant was siphoning off money...

694
00:51:30,506 --> 00:51:32,216
from Larocque.
- A motive!

695
00:51:32,424 --> 00:51:34,551
And close to the body
was the singer, Xania.

696
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:36,387
Xania is not the killer.

697
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:38,889
But I suspect she knows more
than she is telling me.

698
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:41,850
- Where is she now?
- She left suddenly for New York.

699
00:51:42,017 --> 00:51:45,604
We are going to have to follow her
and find out what she is up to.

700
00:51:45,771 --> 00:51:47,231
And if I am going to America...

701
00:51:47,398 --> 00:51:50,275
I am going to have to speak
with a flawless American accent...

702
00:51:50,442 --> 00:51:52,861
so as not to arouse suspicion.

703
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:56,991
So find me the greatest
accent coach in the world.

704
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:59,451
I would like to buy a hamburger.

705
00:51:59,952 --> 00:52:02,496
I would like to buy a hamburger.

706
00:52:02,705 --> 00:52:06,500
I would like to buy a hamburger.

707
00:52:06,667 --> 00:52:08,419
I would like to buy...

708
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:11,463
a hamburger.

709
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,716
No, no, no. Let's break it down.

710
00:52:13,882 --> 00:52:15,134
I.

711
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,927
- I.
- I.

712
00:52:17,094 --> 00:52:18,554
- Would.
- Would.

713
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:21,807
- Would.
- Would.

714
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:26,103
- Would.
- Weird.

715
00:52:26,603 --> 00:52:28,772
Would.

716
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:31,108
Would.

717
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:32,401
- Like.
- Like.

718
00:52:32,568 --> 00:52:33,986
- Like.
- Like.

719
00:52:34,153 --> 00:52:35,612
- To.
- To.

720
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:37,614
- To.
- To.

721
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:39,658
To.

722
00:52:40,492 --> 00:52:41,785
To.

723
00:52:41,994 --> 00:52:43,245
- Buy.
- Buy.

724
00:52:43,412 --> 00:52:44,455
- Buy.
- Bee.

725
00:52:44,663 --> 00:52:47,124
- Buy.
- Bye-bye.

726
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:49,668
- A.
- A.

727
00:52:49,835 --> 00:52:52,004
Hamburger.

728
00:52:52,171 --> 00:52:53,756
Hamburger.

729
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:55,382
Hamburger.

730
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,512
- Hamburger.
- Hamburger.

731
00:53:00,721 --> 00:53:02,973
I would like to buy a hamburger.

732
00:53:03,182 --> 00:53:04,725
I would like to buy a damburger.

733
00:53:05,726 --> 00:53:07,603
It's not "damburger." Hamburger.

734
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:10,856
I'm not saying "damburger." I said,
"I would like to buy a damburger."

735
00:53:11,065 --> 00:53:14,485
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy the hamburger.

736
00:53:14,652 --> 00:53:17,237
- Hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger!

737
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:19,073
- Maybe we should stop.
- We don't quit.

738
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:21,033
We do not quit. Again! Again!

739
00:53:21,742 --> 00:53:24,870
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger!

740
00:53:25,037 --> 00:53:28,207
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy hamburger.

741
00:53:28,415 --> 00:53:30,668
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger.

742
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:34,088
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy hamburger!

743
00:53:34,254 --> 00:53:35,798
I would like to buy a hamburger.

744
00:54:07,913 --> 00:54:10,290
- Have you ever had a hamburger?
- Well, of course not.

745
00:54:10,457 --> 00:54:13,544
It's a disgusting American food.

746
00:54:46,452 --> 00:54:49,121
I never see you with women.

747
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:51,915
I'm married.

748
00:54:53,459 --> 00:54:55,586
You don't wear a ring.

749
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:57,212
To protect her.

750
00:54:57,379 --> 00:54:59,715
I'm afraid some villain
might threaten her.

751
00:54:59,882 --> 00:55:01,800
Yes.

752
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:04,053
Tell me about her.

753
00:55:05,304 --> 00:55:09,266
I consider her the most
beautiful woman in the world.

754
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:12,770
What about yourself?

755
00:55:12,936 --> 00:55:17,775
No, I don't consider myself
a beautiful woman.

756
00:55:18,067 --> 00:55:20,611
I mean, is there a woman
in your life?

757
00:55:20,778 --> 00:55:22,279
Oh, no.

758
00:55:22,488 --> 00:55:25,324
Love has not yet come my way.

759
00:55:25,491 --> 00:55:28,494
How could Inspector Clouseau
be with a simple woman?

760
00:55:28,661 --> 00:55:32,956
She would have to be
so extraordinary in order to keep up.

761
00:55:33,832 --> 00:55:35,459
It's hard.

762
00:55:39,672 --> 00:55:43,217
- What is?
- For you to meet someone.

763
00:55:43,801 --> 00:55:45,761
Oh, yes.

764
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,931
We have a big day tomorrow.

765
00:55:49,098 --> 00:55:53,811
We will go to Xania's hotel
and find out what she is up to.

766
00:55:54,478 --> 00:55:57,439
- Good night, Ponton.
- Good night, Clouseau.

767
00:55:58,357 --> 00:55:59,942
- Good one.
- Thank you.

768
00:56:05,698 --> 00:56:07,658
I got her hotel phone records.

769
00:56:07,866 --> 00:56:09,410
Xania made two phone calls...

770
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:12,246
to a notorious
black-market diamond cutter.

771
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:14,999
There she is! Newspapers!

772
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:22,548
Newspapers!

773
00:56:25,259 --> 00:56:26,927
Newspapers!

774
00:56:28,929 --> 00:56:30,180
Newspapers!

775
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:52,411
Floor 12.

776
00:56:55,247 --> 00:56:58,208
I smell something fishy.

777
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:04,381
May I help you?

778
00:57:18,854 --> 00:57:20,898
Good teamwork.

779
00:57:29,782 --> 00:57:33,452
Stop! Stop whatever it is
you are doing! You are defenseless!

780
00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:36,580
We have already taken care
of your thugs patrolling the building.

781
00:57:36,747 --> 00:57:38,415
I don't have any thugs.

782
00:57:38,624 --> 00:57:40,209
You don't?

783
00:57:40,668 --> 00:57:44,254
Ponton, I think we owe
those men an apology.

784
00:57:44,463 --> 00:57:46,674
And what is it you are cutting?

785
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:49,134
Pink diamond. Clear.

786
00:57:49,343 --> 00:57:52,638
- Clear?
- It's not the Pink Panther.

787
00:57:53,931 --> 00:57:56,850
And what are you doing here
sneaking around?

788
00:57:57,893 --> 00:58:00,562
This purse once belonged
to Josephine Baker.

789
00:58:00,729 --> 00:58:03,524
It was falling apart, so
I had it studded with diamonds...

790
00:58:03,691 --> 00:58:05,693
to wear on-stage
at the Presidential Ball.

791
00:58:05,901 --> 00:58:08,612
Well, why did you just not tell me
why you were coming?

792
00:58:09,196 --> 00:58:11,740
I can't be seen at a diamond cutter.

793
00:58:11,907 --> 00:58:13,784
Not after what happened.

794
00:58:16,203 --> 00:58:20,040
That may be one
of your mysterious clients now.

795
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:21,959
Hello?

796
00:58:22,334 --> 00:58:25,879
Yes, I am the person
in charge of the phone bill.

797
00:58:26,046 --> 00:58:28,132
Well, I'm somewhat happy
with my service.

798
00:58:28,298 --> 00:58:30,300
Twelve months
with that many minutes?

799
00:58:30,509 --> 00:58:32,469
Plus free minutes per month?

800
00:58:32,886 --> 00:58:35,889
Yes, sign me up.
Yes, Jacques Clouseau...

801
00:58:36,056 --> 00:58:38,434
credit card number:

802
00:58:51,947 --> 00:58:55,659
Yes? Yes, you may have
my e-mail address.

803
00:58:56,535 --> 00:59:00,372
DoctorKnockers@aol.com.

804
00:59:01,707 --> 00:59:05,753
Well, I think I just got myself
a pretty good deal.

805
00:59:09,715 --> 00:59:13,344
- When are you leaving the city?
- I'm leaving tomorrow. Yeah.

806
00:59:14,386 --> 00:59:17,556
I may have to seduce her, Ponton,
in order to get her to talk.

807
00:59:17,723 --> 00:59:19,725
- Part of the job.
- Talk about what?

808
00:59:19,892 --> 00:59:22,811
I want to find out what time
her plane is leaving in the morning.

809
00:59:22,978 --> 00:59:25,397
- Why not just ask her?
- Too obvious.

810
00:59:25,564 --> 00:59:28,150
I may have to pump her
for information.

811
00:59:28,317 --> 00:59:31,028
- I see.
- Inspector...

812
00:59:32,071 --> 00:59:35,199
would you like to join me
for dinner at the Waldorf?

813
00:59:35,741 --> 00:59:37,534
Certainly, mademoiselle.

814
00:59:37,743 --> 00:59:39,912
Say, 8:00?

815
00:59:40,537 --> 00:59:41,872
Eight o'clock.

816
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:45,751
Say, I don't know,
my room on the second floor?

817
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:49,463
"I don't know,
my room on the second floor."

818
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:51,590
I'll see you then.

819
00:59:54,176 --> 00:59:56,095
It might be a trap.

820
00:59:56,261 --> 00:59:58,222
Who cares?

821
01:00:16,031 --> 01:00:18,450
Welcome to my room, inspector.

822
01:00:19,618 --> 01:00:21,412
It is lovely weather we are having.

823
01:00:37,136 --> 01:00:40,723
Oh, yes, baby. Oh, yes.

824
01:00:49,732 --> 01:00:51,275
Why?

825
01:00:52,151 --> 01:00:53,444
Why what?

826
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:57,406
Why were you being
so elusive today?

827
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,117
I was afraid of Larocque.

828
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:04,496
- He might be following me.
- Larocque? The casino owner?

829
01:01:04,663 --> 01:01:06,665
He sent out word
threatening to kill anyone...

830
01:01:06,832 --> 01:01:08,625
in possession
of the Pink Panther.

831
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:10,794
He believes it belongs to him.

832
01:01:11,211 --> 01:01:12,796
But why would he follow you?

833
01:01:13,172 --> 01:01:15,883
I was in New York
to see a diamond cutter.

834
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:17,968
He might draw
the wrong conclusion.

835
01:01:18,385 --> 01:01:19,762
You know...

836
01:01:19,928 --> 01:01:25,351
a man sitting here
in your private suite...

837
01:01:25,517 --> 01:01:27,478
so close to you...

838
01:01:27,686 --> 01:01:29,938
might draw
the wrong conclusion too.

839
01:01:30,439 --> 01:01:32,650
Or the right one.

840
01:01:33,484 --> 01:01:35,527
I've heard things
about you, inspector.

841
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,155
What sort of things?

842
01:01:38,322 --> 01:01:40,741
That you really know
how to treat a woman.

843
01:01:46,914 --> 01:01:50,125
Yes. Yes.

844
01:01:50,626 --> 01:01:53,462
Let the games begin.

845
01:01:54,838 --> 01:01:57,883
Let me just slip away.

846
01:02:12,189 --> 01:02:13,857
Yes!

847
01:02:19,238 --> 01:02:21,365
No! No, no! No, no!

848
01:02:22,408 --> 01:02:25,411
My miracle pill
for the middle-aged man.

849
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:37,089
Give it back.

850
01:02:51,186 --> 01:02:52,896
Inspector?

851
01:02:54,231 --> 01:02:59,236
- Are you all right in there?
- I hope you're getting yourself ready.

852
01:03:04,783 --> 01:03:06,744
Inspector? Are you sure
you're okay in there?

853
01:03:06,952 --> 01:03:10,164
Yes, I am. I'm fine.
I'm just getting in the mood for love.

854
01:03:39,485 --> 01:03:41,820
Well, hello.

855
01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:52,790
We need fresh towels in 204.

856
01:03:56,043 --> 01:03:59,296
Don't ask why, just do it.

857
01:03:59,505 --> 01:04:02,675
You have the flight number.
He leaves tomorrow out of JFK.

858
01:04:02,841 --> 01:04:07,096
He'll be easy to spot. He's got
white hair, a thin mustache...

859
01:04:07,262 --> 01:04:10,891
brimming with self-confidence
and completely lost.

860
01:04:19,566 --> 01:04:21,652
- Did you get the stuff?
- Yes.

861
01:04:21,819 --> 01:04:23,195
Good.

862
01:04:23,362 --> 01:04:27,449
Give it to me.
Airline food is for suckers.

863
01:04:27,616 --> 01:04:31,328
I will smuggle this on.
Just act cool.

864
01:04:38,043 --> 01:04:40,045
- Hey, that's Xania!
- Hello.

865
01:04:40,212 --> 01:04:42,589
Hi. Yes, thank you.

866
01:04:42,756 --> 01:04:45,217
I still think she is hiding
something, Ponton.

867
01:04:45,384 --> 01:04:46,677
What?

868
01:04:46,885 --> 01:04:49,888
If I knew what she was hiding,
then it wouldn't be hidden, would it?

869
01:04:50,055 --> 01:04:52,057
- All right. Thank you.
- One more! One more!

870
01:04:52,224 --> 01:04:53,642
Okay, let's go. Next.

871
01:04:53,809 --> 01:04:55,978
Nothing to declare.

872
01:04:59,732 --> 01:05:02,860
- Come on through.
- Hand check on two.

873
01:05:04,236 --> 01:05:06,238
- This your bag, sir?
- Yes, it is.

874
01:05:06,405 --> 01:05:09,533
- We'll have to hand check it.
- Go ahead. I have nothing to hide.

875
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,035
In my bag.

876
01:05:11,702 --> 01:05:13,454
Come with me, sir.

877
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,832
Wait here, pal.

878
01:05:27,593 --> 01:05:30,012
It's a harmless pocketknife.

879
01:05:34,808 --> 01:05:37,311
It's a harmless pair of...
Numchucks?

880
01:05:41,273 --> 01:05:44,735
I don't... I don't even own a mace.
I don't know where that came from.

881
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:52,826
I've never seen that stuff in my life.

882
01:05:53,035 --> 01:05:54,703
Jimbo!

883
01:05:55,579 --> 01:05:57,956
You don't need Jimbo.

884
01:06:01,251 --> 01:06:03,504
- Jimbo, stay.
- What's in your pocket, sir?

885
01:06:03,712 --> 01:06:05,673
- Nothing.
- Sir, I'll say again...

886
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,925
what's in your pocket?
- Nothing.

887
01:06:09,093 --> 01:06:12,179
I'm gonna ask you again,
what's in your pocket, sir?

888
01:06:13,263 --> 01:06:14,640
All right.

889
01:06:14,807 --> 01:06:17,476
I have, in my pocket...

890
01:06:17,643 --> 01:06:20,354
a couple of "hambwortsforts."

891
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:22,856
What?

892
01:06:24,149 --> 01:06:27,444
I have in my pocket...

893
01:06:27,778 --> 01:06:30,239
a couple of "dolvargars."

894
01:06:30,948 --> 01:06:32,282
Sir?

895
01:06:33,117 --> 01:06:39,081
- Sir, in your pocket you have?
- All right, I have four "hanholders."

896
01:06:39,415 --> 01:06:41,125
I'm sorry. Once more.

897
01:06:42,668 --> 01:06:43,961
Again!

898
01:06:44,128 --> 01:06:45,587
- Sir...
- Hey, what's that?

899
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,551
- Sir... Sir, I'm losing my patience.
- Oh, you are?

900
01:06:50,718 --> 01:06:52,302
- You are losing your patience?
- Yes.

901
01:06:52,469 --> 01:06:55,222
I'm simply telling you I have
a couple of "tamburthers."

902
01:06:55,597 --> 01:06:59,018
I've got an End darter down on six.
I've got an End darter down on six!

903
01:06:59,184 --> 01:07:01,854
- Locked and loaded, sir!
- Show me your hands, sir!

904
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:03,814
All right, I'll just show you.

905
01:07:04,857 --> 01:07:07,234
- No, no, no! Stay here, sir.
- Sic him, W!

906
01:07:21,457 --> 01:07:25,210
- Yes, that's him!
- Inspector, what is a "damburgert"?

907
01:07:25,377 --> 01:07:28,839
Inspector, how does it feel
to have let down the nation?

908
01:07:34,511 --> 01:07:38,974
So much for the heroic
Inspector Clouseau.

909
01:07:41,101 --> 01:07:45,648
Well, this is a glorious day
for France.

910
01:07:46,231 --> 01:07:47,983
How so, chief inspector?

911
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:50,944
Because a stupid idiot
named Clouseau...

912
01:07:51,111 --> 01:07:55,199
is going to be stripped of his rank
while I take over his case.

913
01:07:55,407 --> 01:07:57,618
You have a second man
named Clouseau?

914
01:07:57,785 --> 01:08:01,163
My God. Leave us alone
for a moment.

915
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:04,875
You, out. Go, go. Go.
I must have a private word...

916
01:08:05,084 --> 01:08:08,003
with Inspector Clouseau.

917
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:09,755
Understand something, Clouseau.

918
01:08:09,922 --> 01:08:13,384
When I made you an inspector,
it was not because I thought...

919
01:08:13,592 --> 01:08:15,678
you had any value as a detective.

920
01:08:15,844 --> 01:08:21,141
It was because I thought you were the
stupidest policeman in all of France.

921
01:08:21,558 --> 01:08:24,812
A hopeless, deluded idiot.

922
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:27,606
Then I was not promoted
for my merits?

923
01:08:27,815 --> 01:08:31,318
I only made you inspector
because I needed someone...

924
01:08:31,485 --> 01:08:34,029
who would quietly get
nowhere until I was ready...

925
01:08:34,196 --> 01:08:36,198
to take over the case myself.

926
01:08:36,657 --> 01:08:38,617
I was trying to catch a killer.

927
01:08:38,784 --> 01:08:41,328
You were trying...

928
01:08:42,955 --> 01:08:47,793
You were trying to become a hero.
Well, you will be stripped...

929
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,546
of your rank,
ridiculed by the media...

930
01:08:50,713 --> 01:08:52,297
and I will be done with you.

931
01:08:52,464 --> 01:08:56,635
And now if you will excuse me,
ex-inspector, I must go and prepare...

932
01:08:56,802 --> 01:09:00,347
for the arrest which will win me
the Medal of Honor...

933
01:09:00,514 --> 01:09:05,602
catapult me to the National
Assembly, and after that, who knows?

934
01:09:06,228 --> 01:09:09,315
- Goodbye, Clouseau.
- Shall we lock him up?

935
01:09:09,481 --> 01:09:11,025
Look at him.

936
01:09:11,191 --> 01:09:15,279
He is finished.
Let him go home to obscurity.

937
01:09:24,788 --> 01:09:26,373
You knew?

938
01:09:49,271 --> 01:09:50,981
Ponton...

939
01:09:51,482 --> 01:09:53,734
things were not
as I supposed they were.

940
01:09:55,027 --> 01:09:58,656
And if I ever made
you look foolish...

941
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:01,450
I am sorry.

942
01:10:02,701 --> 01:10:06,372
It was an honor
serving under you, sir.

943
01:10:18,384 --> 01:10:20,177
Good one.

944
01:10:43,951 --> 01:10:45,828
The Internet.

945
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:47,788
Hello, old friend.

946
01:10:50,582 --> 01:10:54,128
"To download your new
cell-phone ringtone...

947
01:10:54,586 --> 01:10:58,465
press the button
that says 'download."'

948
01:10:59,091 --> 01:11:03,887
I take the mouse and I click,
but do not drag...

949
01:11:04,096 --> 01:11:08,017
the button that says "download."

950
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,113
Gentlemen, and lady,
good morning.

951
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,366
Meet Dr. Li How Pang.

952
01:11:24,533 --> 01:11:27,745
He was, of course, in the VIP box
when Gluant was killed.

953
01:11:27,953 --> 01:11:31,790
Coincidentally, Dr. Pang would
send Gluant large sums of money.

954
01:11:31,957 --> 01:11:36,337
Presumably, Gluant was to invest
these sums on Pang's behalf.

955
01:11:36,503 --> 01:11:40,466
But being a compulsive gambler,
Gluant took the money...

956
01:11:40,632 --> 01:11:42,926
and gambled it all away.

957
01:11:43,552 --> 01:11:45,929
So Pang had the motive.

958
01:11:46,347 --> 01:11:49,099
He had the opportunity.

959
01:11:49,308 --> 01:11:53,937
Pang is in France
for the president's ball tonight.

960
01:11:54,104 --> 01:11:57,941
We will arrest him there
for the murder of Yves Gluant.

961
01:11:58,108 --> 01:12:00,194
Bravo, chief inspector.

962
01:12:01,028 --> 01:12:04,031
<i>I am pleased to announce that
I am personally taking over...</i>

963
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:08,410
<i>... the Pink Panther investigation
and that an arrest is imminent.</i>

964
01:12:08,577 --> 01:12:10,329
<i>- Thank you.
- Chief inspector...</i>

965
01:12:10,496 --> 01:12:12,790
<i>... the coroner has announced
that Bizu was killed...</i>

966
01:12:12,998 --> 01:12:16,335
<i>... with a perfect shot to the
occipital lobe. Any comments?</i>

967
01:12:16,502 --> 01:12:18,921
The occipital lobe?

968
01:12:19,838 --> 01:12:21,840
<i>It's irrelevant.</i>

969
01:12:24,677 --> 01:12:27,137
The occipital lobe.

970
01:12:41,193 --> 01:12:43,362
That makes me feel good.

971
01:12:51,161 --> 01:12:52,997
Zoom.

972
01:13:01,255 --> 01:13:04,091
Of course.

973
01:13:08,887 --> 01:13:11,265
Ponton, I need you
over here immediately.

974
01:13:11,432 --> 01:13:14,226
We are back on the case.

975
01:13:17,604 --> 01:13:21,692
Nicole, I believe Bizu and Gluant
were killed by the same person.

976
01:13:21,859 --> 01:13:24,153
And that the killer
will strike again tonight.

977
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,822
I want you to meet me
at the presidential palace.

978
01:13:27,031 --> 01:13:30,200
And bring my vinyl bag marked
"presidential palace."

979
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:34,663
And hurry! Xania is in grave danger.

980
01:13:36,415 --> 01:13:40,461
Ponton, we must get to the
presidential palace immediately!

981
01:13:40,627 --> 01:13:42,963
- Put your seat belt on.
- I don't need a seat belt.

982
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:44,715
Let's see what this baby can do!

983
01:13:53,057 --> 01:13:55,768
No. Clouseau should not
be on this list.

984
01:13:55,934 --> 01:13:58,687
He is no longer allowed
at state affairs.

985
01:13:58,854 --> 01:14:02,399
He has been disgraced
and humiliated.

986
01:14:02,608 --> 01:14:05,653
But what about all the reporters
who will want to come in?

987
01:14:05,819 --> 01:14:09,948
When the time is right,
let them pour in.

988
01:14:29,968 --> 01:14:31,804
Clouseau.

989
01:14:33,639 --> 01:14:35,724
I'm sorry, but your name
is not on the list.

990
01:14:35,891 --> 01:14:37,601
Not on the list?

991
01:14:38,769 --> 01:14:41,021
Dreyfus must have made sure
you cannot get in.

992
01:14:47,194 --> 01:14:48,570
Ponton.

993
01:14:54,201 --> 01:14:56,286
- Inspector, here is your bag.
- Good work, Nicole.

994
01:14:57,371 --> 01:14:59,331
- What is that?
- Camouflage. Let's go.

995
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:02,001
- Nicole.
- Yes?

996
01:15:02,001 --> 01:15:04,003
- One last thing.
- Yes?

997
01:15:10,759 --> 01:15:12,052
It's evening...

998
01:15:12,344 --> 01:15:15,306
and you look beautiful
without your glasses.

999
01:15:16,682 --> 01:15:19,059
Thank you, inspector.

1000
01:15:44,835 --> 01:15:46,420
- Chief inspector.
- What?

1001
01:15:46,545 --> 01:15:49,506
Our men have reported a sighting
of Inspector Clouseau.

1002
01:15:50,507 --> 01:15:51,508
Clouseau?

1003
01:15:52,384 --> 01:15:56,180
I know what he's up to. He wants
to try to make the arrest himself.

1004
01:15:57,389 --> 01:16:01,644
If you see Clouseau,
put him in cuffs for trespassing...

1005
01:16:01,727 --> 01:16:03,729
and parade him through the party.

1006
01:16:13,489 --> 01:16:15,407
Dr. Pang has arrived.

1007
01:16:18,994 --> 01:16:21,622
We will take him after the first song.

1008
01:16:23,165 --> 01:16:24,875
Yes, yes. Very true.

1009
01:17:38,157 --> 01:17:40,659
Good work, Ponton. We're in.

1010
01:17:42,369 --> 01:17:44,163
Look!

1011
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:47,207
It's the killer! After him!

1012
01:17:47,374 --> 01:17:52,338
- Change outfits.
- Stop! Turn around.

1013
01:17:52,546 --> 01:17:53,839
Who are you?

1014
01:17:54,006 --> 01:17:59,011
- What are you doing here?
- We are... We are two... We are...

1015
01:17:59,219 --> 01:18:01,263
- I'll tell you exactly who we are.
- Yes.

1016
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:03,682
- We are...
- I've been looking for you everywhere.

1017
01:18:03,849 --> 01:18:05,684
Where the hell have you been?

1018
01:18:05,851 --> 01:18:08,354
- You know these two?
- Of course I know them.

1019
01:18:08,562 --> 01:18:11,774
They are Xania's backup dancers.
They go on in the third act...

1020
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:14,026
with the Komodo dragon
and the snow machine.

1021
01:18:14,193 --> 01:18:16,528
Why do you think they are
dressed like that, for fun?

1022
01:18:16,695 --> 01:18:19,198
- Prove it.
- We don't have to prove...

1023
01:18:56,944 --> 01:18:58,779
Can't you see these dancers
are exhausted?

1024
01:18:58,988 --> 01:19:00,322
Go and fetch them some water.

1025
01:19:02,574 --> 01:19:04,535
That was fantastic.

1026
01:19:04,994 --> 01:19:06,620
- You think so?
- You are...

1027
01:19:08,205 --> 01:19:10,749
an amazing woman.

1028
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:17,923
Inspector, the killer.

1029
01:19:32,146 --> 01:19:35,482
Now I am ready to catch a killer.

1030
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,124
Stop!

1031
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:54,835
Stop in the name of the law.

1032
01:19:55,544 --> 01:19:57,004
Get him!

1033
01:19:57,546 --> 01:19:59,840
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

1034
01:20:02,009 --> 01:20:05,262
Ponton, you follow him that way.
I'll go this way and cut him off.

1035
01:20:08,265 --> 01:20:09,516
Stop!

1036
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,187
Turn around.

1037
01:20:14,229 --> 01:20:17,024
- You're under arre...
- You are under arrest!

1038
01:20:17,191 --> 01:20:19,151
Ponton! After him!

1039
01:20:19,485 --> 01:20:20,861
Now.

1040
01:20:21,737 --> 01:20:22,821
Go, go!

1041
01:20:23,197 --> 01:20:26,659
Well, Dr. Pang.
In the name of the statutes...

1042
01:20:27,076 --> 01:20:29,536
and laws of the great nation
of France...

1043
01:20:31,205 --> 01:20:34,875
I arrest you for the murder
of Yves Gluant.

1044
01:20:39,672 --> 01:20:41,548
Clouseau! Arrest him.

1045
01:20:43,258 --> 01:20:44,885
Which one is he?

1046
01:20:45,052 --> 01:20:46,303
That would be him.

1047
01:20:50,683 --> 01:20:54,561
In the name of the statutes and laws
of the great nation of France...

1048
01:20:54,728 --> 01:20:56,981
I arrest you for the murder
of Yves Gluant.

1049
01:20:57,147 --> 01:20:59,525
Yuri, the trainer who trains.

1050
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:03,570
And who are you?

1051
01:21:03,737 --> 01:21:06,573
I am Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

1052
01:21:07,449 --> 01:21:09,576
Gluant was nothing!

1053
01:21:09,743 --> 01:21:11,370
I drew up the plays.

1054
01:21:11,912 --> 01:21:15,416
He takes credit for brilliant
French defense which I gave him...

1055
01:21:15,624 --> 01:21:19,753
and treats me like I'm dead. Fine.
Now he is dead from Chinese poison.

1056
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:24,049
Inspector, what made you
think it was him?

1057
01:21:24,216 --> 01:21:29,430
But, Ponton, think back.
You were there.

1058
01:21:31,015 --> 01:21:32,057
WHY DO YOU BOTHER ME?

1059
01:21:32,266 --> 01:21:33,892
WHY DID YOU BRING ME HERE?
I'M BUSY.

1060
01:21:35,102 --> 01:21:37,062
THE COACH WAS KILLED
WITH CHINESE POISON.

1061
01:21:37,271 --> 01:21:38,856
YOU SHOULD LOOK
FOR SOCCER TRAINERS.

1062
01:21:40,524 --> 01:21:44,069
THEY ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A
KNOWLEDGE OF CHINESE HERBS.

1063
01:21:44,778 --> 01:21:46,363
She was right, of course.

1064
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:50,659
According to statute 87223, every
trainer of the national soccer team...

1065
01:21:50,826 --> 01:21:52,911
must have a knowledge
of Chinese herbs.

1066
01:21:53,245 --> 01:21:56,957
<i>This made it easy for him
to murder Gluant.</i>

1067
01:21:57,916 --> 01:22:00,419
- And Bizu?
- Simple.

1068
01:22:00,586 --> 01:22:04,006
Bizu had often heard
Yuri's rants against Gluant.

1069
01:22:04,173 --> 01:22:07,635
So Bizu blackmailed Yuri
and got himself killed.

1070
01:22:08,469 --> 01:22:10,804
Oh, it's you.

1071
01:22:13,599 --> 01:22:15,476
A stunning shot to the head...

1072
01:22:15,976 --> 01:22:18,812
burrowing deeply
into the occipital lobe.

1073
01:22:18,979 --> 01:22:20,689
But Yuri is a soccer trainer.

1074
01:22:20,856 --> 01:22:23,400
That shot was made
by an expert marksman.

1075
01:22:23,567 --> 01:22:25,486
Chief inspector, I'm sure
you're familiar...

1076
01:22:25,694 --> 01:22:27,488
with Russian army statute 611.

1077
01:22:28,197 --> 01:22:29,448
Well, of course.

1078
01:22:29,615 --> 01:22:31,742
All members must be...

1079
01:22:31,909 --> 01:22:33,952
expert marksmen...
- Expert marksmen.

1080
01:22:34,119 --> 01:22:37,665
and understand the location
of the occipital...

1081
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:40,000
- Occipital lobe, of course.
- Yes.

1082
01:22:40,209 --> 01:22:43,170
- Very true.
- Yes, Yuri.

1083
01:22:43,337 --> 01:22:45,506
Xania is still alive.

1084
01:22:45,673 --> 01:22:49,593
But you hated her. And that's
why you are trying to kill her.

1085
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,638
You hated her because she
went with Bizu and then Gluant...

1086
01:22:52,805 --> 01:22:54,848
and treated you
like you were nothing.

1087
01:22:55,265 --> 01:22:59,061
But you forgot a fundamental truth
about women.

1088
01:22:59,228 --> 01:23:01,689
A woman is like a...

1089
01:23:01,855 --> 01:23:03,816
Is like a...

1090
01:23:03,983 --> 01:23:05,359
artichoke.

1091
01:23:06,527 --> 01:23:10,322
You have to do a bit of work
before you get to her heart.

1092
01:23:12,199 --> 01:23:15,160
What about the diamond?
What about the Pink Panther?

1093
01:23:15,327 --> 01:23:20,124
Yes, thank you, Inspector Clouseau
for carrying out my orders.

1094
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:21,834
Hand over the diamond, Yuri.

1095
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:24,211
What do I care about
your stinking diamond?

1096
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:26,046
He does not have the diamond.

1097
01:23:26,255 --> 01:23:28,757
The murderer does not have
the diamond?

1098
01:23:28,924 --> 01:23:31,302
- No.
- Well, then, where is it...

1099
01:23:31,468 --> 01:23:33,053
Inspector Clouseau?

1100
01:23:33,262 --> 01:23:36,181
It is there! In her purse.

1101
01:23:37,558 --> 01:23:38,934
Let me see.

1102
01:23:51,071 --> 01:23:53,824
Sorry, Clouseau, no diamond.

1103
01:24:02,124 --> 01:24:04,293
The purse, please.

1104
01:24:10,174 --> 01:24:11,842
Could you hold that, please?

1105
01:24:23,354 --> 01:24:26,899
After Gluant came to me, he said
he decided to stop cheating on me.

1106
01:24:27,858 --> 01:24:30,027
<i>Then he asked me to marry him...</i>

1107
01:24:32,154 --> 01:24:34,490
<i>... and put the ring in my hands.</i>

1108
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:38,869
After he was killed, I thought...

1109
01:24:39,036 --> 01:24:41,955
if I came forward with the ring,
everyone would think I did it.

1110
01:24:42,122 --> 01:24:44,667
If Gluant gave you the ring
before he died...

1111
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:50,965
then according to civil statute
812-914B, you are the rightful owner.

1112
01:24:51,131 --> 01:24:53,759
You may keep the Pink Panther.

1113
01:24:59,139 --> 01:25:01,558
But, inspector,
how did you know she had it?

1114
01:25:01,725 --> 01:25:03,227
It was simple, Ponton.

1115
01:25:03,394 --> 01:25:06,605
<i>I was looking at a photo of myself
at the checkpoint.</i>

1116
01:25:06,772 --> 01:25:08,565
<i>Something caught my eye:</i>

1117
01:25:08,732 --> 01:25:11,986
<i>Xania's purse passing through
the x-ray machine.</i>

1118
01:25:12,486 --> 01:25:14,947
<i>I enlarged the photo...</i>

1119
01:25:15,155 --> 01:25:16,615
<i>... and in it...</i>

1120
01:25:17,658 --> 01:25:18,909
<i>... the Pink Panther.</i>

1121
01:25:19,076 --> 01:25:22,788
- The case is closed!
- Bravo, Clouseau.

1122
01:25:28,544 --> 01:25:30,337
Bravo!

1123
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:35,175
<i>Clouseau! Clouseau!
Clouseau! Clouseau!</i>

1124
01:25:40,014 --> 01:25:40,514
Chief inspector...

1125
01:25:40,681 --> 01:25:42,474
I can't thank you enough
for giving me...

1126
01:25:42,474 --> 01:25:44,351
the opportunity to solve
the Pink Panther murder.

1127
01:25:44,435 --> 01:25:46,437
Without your decision to put me
on the case...

1128
01:25:46,603 --> 01:25:49,773
who knows, someone else might've
won the Medal of Honor this year.

1129
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:51,191
Yes, I know.

1130
01:25:51,358 --> 01:25:55,654
I owe it all to you, chief inspector.
Without you, I would be nothing.

1131
01:25:55,821 --> 01:25:59,658
- Perhaps you still are.
- Excellent verbal joust, inspector.

1132
01:25:59,825 --> 01:26:02,036
You idiot! Oh, no.

1133
01:26:02,202 --> 01:26:04,830
- Hit it, Ponton.
- No! Clouseau!

1134
01:26:04,997 --> 01:26:06,623
Stop the car. Dear...

1135
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:08,417
What?

1136
01:26:08,584 --> 01:26:10,169
Nothing.

1137
01:26:10,669 --> 01:26:11,879
You didn't say:

1138
01:26:12,046 --> 01:26:16,508
"Stop the car. Dear God,
I beg of you, stop the car"?

1139
01:26:16,717 --> 01:26:18,260
No.

1140
01:26:26,935 --> 01:26:28,896
Does it hurt?

1141
01:26:34,318 --> 01:26:35,694
What?

1142
01:26:37,237 --> 01:26:38,906
I can't understand you.

1143
01:26:43,452 --> 01:26:45,913
You know what,
I think he wants to recline.

1144
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,998
There's a lever right here.

1145
01:26:48,165 --> 01:26:50,250
Oh, it's on the other side, I'm sorry.

1146
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:53,253
A bit of a reach.
Wait a minute. I'll get it.

1147
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:55,381
I'll get it right here.

1148
01:26:55,631 --> 01:26:58,550
Is right back here.

1149
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:03,013
There must be a simpler way...

1150
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:06,183
of working this...
Oh, there's a remote control...

1151
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:07,434
so that you can just...

1152
01:27:07,643 --> 01:27:10,479
It's sensitive! I hardly touched it!
But it goes up...

1153
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:16,527
That's it! That's it!

1154
01:27:20,656 --> 01:27:24,243
- You know, Ponton.
- Yes, inspector.

1155
01:27:25,077 --> 01:27:27,997
This is a very hard time
for Inspector Dreyfus.

1156
01:27:28,163 --> 01:27:31,542
It is important that
we show compassion.

1157
01:27:31,709 --> 01:27:34,962
And we must use the gentle
healing power of laughter.

1158
01:27:57,109 --> 01:27:58,902
This is going to hurt.

1159
01:28:01,322 --> 01:28:04,074
Clouseau!

1160
01:28:07,703 --> 01:28:10,039
That breeze feels good.
