2
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,627
Man who catch fly with chopstick...

3
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,629
accomplish anything.

4
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,216
You ever catch one?

5
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,926
Not yet.

6
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,119
What was that you were doing
on those stumps over there?

7
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:03,414
- Called "crane technique."
- Does it work?

8
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,417
If do right, no can defense.

9
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,044
Could you teach me?

10
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,589
First learn stand,
then learn fly.

11
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,175
Nature rule, Daniel-san.
Not mine.

12
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,470
- Where'd you learn it from?
- Father teach.

13
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,431
- You must have had some father.
- Oh, yes.

14
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,571
"Valor."

15
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,360
Johnny, leave him alone!
He's had enough!

16
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,072
- I'll decide when he's had enough!
- What is wrong with you?

17
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,074
- An enemy deserves no mercy!
- Right!

18
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,743
- No mercy!
- Right!

19
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,869
You're crazy!

20
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,543
Tommy, Bobby, get him!

21
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,139
Mercy is for the weak.

22
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,142
Here, on the street,
in competition...

23
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,269
a man confronts you,
he is the enemy.

24
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:52,106
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

25
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,904
Come on, let's forget this.

26
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,448
Wait. Not yet.

27
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,075
Time out.

28
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,118
Go to your sensei.
Turn. Kneel.

29
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,455
Johnny, you're a cream puff!.

30
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,083
Sweep the leg.

31
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,587
You have a problem with that?

32
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,049
No, Sensei.

33
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,594
No mercy.

34
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,447
It's over,Johnny!
You did it!

35
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,995
LaRusso, you okay?
Can you go on?

36
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,788
Get him a body bag!

37
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,500
- All right, feet.
- Do it again!

38
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,670
That's a warning for
illegal contact to the knee.

39
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,839
Finish it!
No mercy!

40
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,592
No mercy!
Way to finish,Johnny!

41
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,926
Finish him!

42
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,103
Winner!

43
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,538
Hey, Mr. Miyagi,
you know, I was thinking.

44
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,207
About what, Daniel-san?

45
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,335
That maybe we should have
a strategy now, you know?

46
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,836
For what?

47
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,714
My future.
My whole tournament career.

48
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,800
Miyagi already have one.

49
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,929
Really? What is it?

50
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,472
Early retirement.

51
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,775
Ali and mother
wait for us at restaurant.

52
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,610
I know. I'm starving.

53
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,654
- That was great.
- Thank you.

54
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,699
LaRusso, very impressive win.
You showed a lot of poise.

55
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,078
People are gonna be talking about that
last kick for years. Congratulations.

56
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,580
Get out of my way!
Out of my way!

57
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,583
- What you doin' to the brother?
- Don't play with me.

58
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,128
Excuse me.

59
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,309
Why does he act like that?

60
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,855
That guy just doesn't know
what karate's all about.

61
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,150
- Well, maybe he should learn.
- Would you like to teach him?

62
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,611
- Good luck, Daniel.
- Thanks.

63
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,113
- Take care.
- Thanks.

64
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,532
Oy, keep ladies waiting.

65
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,619
- Wait, wait!
- What?

66
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,956
- Could we have your autograph?
- Yeah, man!

67
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,292
- So, how you guys doin'?
- Great.

68
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,461
Oh, yeah?
Where are you from?

69
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,671
- Reseda.
- You're from Res--

70
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,549
I'm from Reseda.
I moved there a couple months ago.

71
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,885
- Maybe we'll see you sometime.
- Daniel-san.

72
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,762
- What?
- Come. Getting late.

73
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,348
It's the price of fame.
Gotta get used to it.

74
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,059
Take it easy.
Maybe I'll see you.

75
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,769
That's not fair.
I got second place.

76
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,314
Second place is no place!
You're off the team!

77
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,316
- I did my best.
- What did you say?

78
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,277
- I did my best.
- You're nothin'! You're a loser!

79
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,905
- No, you're the loser.
- I'm the loser, huh?

80
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,036
- Now who's the loser?
- You're really sick, man.

81
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,500
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Don't!

82
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,044
How does second place
feel now, huh?

83
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,254
- He can't breathe!
- Mind your business.

84
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,423
- You're gonna kill him!
- Sensei, please.

85
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,259
You're hurting him.
He's sorry. He really is.

86
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,597
- Let him go.
- Mr. Miyagi's right.

87
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,140
Let him go!

88
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,226
I said, let him go!

89
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,603
Beat it, slope, or you're next.

90
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,725
Mercy is for the weak.

91
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,979
We do not train
to be merciful here.

92
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,190
A man face you, he is enemy.

93
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:48,111
Enemy deserve no mercy.

94
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,711
Daniel-san,
ladies no wait forever.

95
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,172
You could've killed him,
couldn't you?

96
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,591
- Oy.
- Why didn't you then?

97
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,761
Because, Daniel-san, for person
with no forgiveness in heart...

98
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,890
Iiving even worse punishment
than death.

99
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,741
Oh, Daniel-san,
must have been some senior prom.

100
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,202
- What happened?
- You mean, what didn't happen.

101
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,996
First I let Ali borrow the car,
and she redesigns my fender.

102
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,708
I don't know what she did to the engine,
but that ain't runnin' right either.

103
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,211
And you know what else she does?

104
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,257
Tells me that she's just fallen in love
with some football player from UCLA.

105
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,384
- Why didn't she just lie?
- Things could be worse.

106
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,469
Don't worry about it.
They are.

107
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:40,098
Last night I find out my mom
got picked by a company to go to Fresno.

108
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,561
Two months. We leave tomorrow afternoon.
I gotta spend my whole summer in Fresno.

109
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,940
You're not gonna
be able to fix that.

110
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,194
How'd you do that?

111
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,905
What'd you do?

112
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,160
- Come. Miyagi tell you later.
- Where we goin'?

113
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,204
I have just the thing
make you feel better.

114
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,500
- Probably got work for me to do.
- Hit nail on head.

115
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,295
How come every time I have a problem,
you have work for me?

116
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:14,132
- Cosmic coincidence.
- When'd you build this?

117
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,176
Daniel-san, watch.

118
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,237
Come. Take off jacket.
You try.

119
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,283
Must focus.

120
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,702
Concentrate.

121
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,497
Focus. Most important.

122
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,169
- I can't, Mr. Miyagi, not today.
- Why?

123
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,172
Because my whole life
is goin' out of focus, that's why.

124
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,050
When you feel life out of focus...

125
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,386
always return to basic oflife.

126
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,139
What, praying?

127
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,682
Breathing.

128
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,101
No breathe, no life.

129
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,537
Oy. Come try it.

130
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,839
Out of mouth.
Breathe in through nose.

131
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,052
Breathe out of mouth.

132
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,183
Breathe in.

133
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,522
Breathe out.

134
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,528
Oy. Now how feel?

135
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,116
Better. More focused.

136
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,286
Good. Come back to work.

137
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,803
- Hey, I did it.
- You focused, Daniel-san.

138
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:27,432
Remember:
Breathe in, breathe out.

139
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,101
In...

140
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,603
out.

141
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,374
Very good work.

142
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,429
Yeah. I'll be right there.

143
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,599
- How feel?
- Much better, thanks.

144
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,726
What am I building
out there, any way?

145
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,353
Guest room.

146
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,856
- You expecting company?
- Ah, refugee.

147
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:22,195
Refugee? Oh, yeah?
That's great. From where?

148
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,739
Fresno.

149
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,873
Fresno?

150
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,417
Miyagi talk to mother
last night too.

151
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,587
- And she said I could stay here?
- lflike.

152
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,549
- I don't have to go to Fresno?
- If no want.

153
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,093
Oh, man, you saved my life!

154
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,179
Thanks!
Mr. Miyagi, thanks.

155
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,349
Welcome.

156
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,017
Oy. Iced tea.

157
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,103
Oh, yeah.
Wait. Look.

158
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,898
I made this for you. It's rosewood.
I thought it'd be nice to show 'em off.

159
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,111
Daniel-san, thank you for gift...

160
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,280
but why show off?

161
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,325
It says something about you,
winnin' the Medal of Honor.

162
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,995
It says you're brave.
I thought it'd be neat.

163
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,540
This say you brave.

164
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,626
This say you lucky.

165
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,631
- Oh, Mr. Miyagi live here?
- Excuse me.

166
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,383
- " Miyagi."
- Excuse me.

167
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,887
Mr. Miyagi. Registered letter
for you, sir, from Okinawa.

168
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,889
Okinawa?

169
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,892
Yes, sir.
Would you sign here, please?

170
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,353
This is some place you have here.

171
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,440
From the outside yard,
you'd never know it.

172
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,276
You should charge admission.

173
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,987
My missus loves this stuff.

174
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,698
You mind ifl bring her by
sometime to see it?

175
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,410
Some other time, maybe.

176
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,219
What is it?

177
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,681
My father.

178
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,393
He very sick.

179
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,066
Your father? I didn't even
know he was still alive.

180
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,038
How come you can get
a passport in one day?

181
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,165
Have next-day plane ticket.

182
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,878
You never told me, why'd you leave
Okinawa in the first place?

183
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,423
Fall in love with girl.

184
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,426
So? Why'd you leave?

185
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,264
Was arranged by her parents
she marry someone else.

186
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,561
- Did you ever meet the guy?
- Hai.

187
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,896
What was he like?

188
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,691
Was Miyagi best friend.

189
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,075
So this is your old girlfriend, Yukie?
She sent the letter?

190
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,786
- Hai.
- And this is your buddy.

191
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,832
My best buddy, Sato.

192
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,419
- You think he's still alive?
- We were same age.

193
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,464
What did he do when
he found out about you two?

194
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,468
Challenge Miyagi to fight.

195
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,971
Must've been some girl.

196
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,390
Oh, Miyagi remember.

197
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,310
I make big speech...

198
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,520
in front of whole village.

199
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,023
Miyagi breakwith tradition...

200
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,775
go against parent arrangement.

201
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,571
Marry yukie anyway.

202
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,914
Of course, Sato feel disgrace.

203
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:06,336
So challenge Miyagi to fight
to save his honor.

204
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:11,174
- And you lost?
- No.

205
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,218
Never fight.

206
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,179
Next day leave Okinawa forever.

207
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,267
What about her?
Didn't you love her?

208
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,061
Very much.

209
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,605
- Well, did she love you?
- Hai.

210
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,609
- So, then how could you leave?
- Miyagi no believe in fighting.

211
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,279
I know that,
but you guys were in love. Come on.

212
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,701
Never put passion before principle.

213
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,538
Even if win, you lose.

214
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,254
Think they got married?

215
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,674
Sato, his family
was richest in village.

216
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,219
Yukie's was poorest.
Was good arrangement.

217
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:01,724
It was 45 years ago. He shouldn't
be angry about his honor anymore.

218
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:07,313
In Okinawa,
honor have no time limit.

219
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,526
You serious?

220
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,781
In Okinawa, honor very serious.

221
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,969
I guess I'd better get goin'.
I gotta go help my mom pack.

222
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,346
I'll stop by tomorrow,
okay, Mr. Miyagi?

223
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,017
Taxi leave 6:00 p.m.

224
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,603
Yeah, I'll be here by then.

225
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:53,735
Miyagi sorry things not work out.

226
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,779
That's no problem.
I hope your dad's okay.

227
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,378
You're cutting it
pretty close, mister.

228
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,222
- Go airport.
- All right.

229
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,897
Have a good flight.
Nice to see you.

230
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,400
- Hello.
- Good evening.

231
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,530
You will be in seat 32-B.

232
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,032
- Enjoy the flight.
- Mr. Miyagi!

233
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,910
Wait! I'm comin' with you!
My mother said it's okay.

234
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:29,956
- I mean, if it's okay with you.
- Very expensive ticket.

235
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,876
I got the money from my savings account.
It's all taken care of.

236
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,712
Savings for college education.

237
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,673
So I'll get a job when we get back
and I'll go six months late.

238
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,925
It doesn't make a difference
when I go.

239
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:44,262
-Jobs very hard to find.
- Yeah, I know.

240
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:48,433
I mean, Mr. Miyagi,
you're more important than college.

241
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,019
You're more important
than anything to me.

242
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,605
When I need you,
you're always there for me.

243
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:57,609
I really wanna go, and if it's
okay with you, I'd like to go.

244
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,987
Daniel-san,
don't think good idea.

245
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,656
It'll give me a chance
to study Okinawan history up close.

246
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,951
- Come on.
- Never know you study that.

247
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,536
I just started.

248
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,499
- I'm closing the doors.
- Come on.

249
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:15,376
- Please?
- Go back to the gate, young man.

250
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,882
Young man coming with us.

251
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,010
Mr. Miyagi, thank you.

252
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,305
No, Daniel-san.
Thank you.

253
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:33,269
- Hope you don't get airsick.
- What's airsick?

254
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:44,781
You know the biggest U.S. air base
in the Pacific is on Okinawa?

255
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:51,663
What's the name
of your village again?

256
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,498
Tomi Village.

257
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,960
I can't find it.

258
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,755
Find Naha?

259
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:03,174
Yeah, I know where Naha is.

260
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,219
Go south, along the sea.

261
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,596
Find Tomi Village.

262
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,807
I keep runnin' into the air base.

263
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:16,980
You look again morning.
MaybeTomi Village be there.

264
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,815
Get some sleep.

265
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:56,227
Was Sato as good as you in karate?

266
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,439
Have same teacher.

267
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,401
Your father?
He taught both of you?

268
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:09,073
I thought you said your family's karate
was only taught from father to son.

269
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,368
Miyagi ask father...

270
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,954
make exception this case.

271
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:26,257
If you fought Sato, you think
your father would have been referee?

272
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,595
No referee.

273
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,266
How do you know who wins?

274
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:40,021
The one who dead doesn't.

275
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:20,436
It's pretty weird having somebody
go through my stuff like that.

276
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,814
Glad I didn't have
any dirty laundry.

277
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,110
Was this place here
when you left?

278
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,946
Miyagi leave Okinawa by boat.

279
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,241
No airport Okinawa at that time.

280
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:35,994
I kept lookin' through my book.
I still can't find your village.

281
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:39,372
- How are we gonna find it?
- Ask taxi.

282
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,501
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, isn't that him?

283
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,631
Can you break a log like that?

284
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:53,219
Don't know.
Never been attacked by tree.

285
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:12,197
It is great honor.
I am Chozen Toguchi.

286
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,325
Yukie-san say sorry
she could not meet you herself.

287
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,452
We have a car waiting for you.

288
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:19,954
Car?

289
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,208
Please.

290
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,546
You speakvery good English,
Toguchi-san.

291
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,299
In Okinawa, it help to speak
very good English.

292
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:35,094
Myfriend and student,
Daniel LaRusso.

293
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:36,596
Thank you.

294
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,933
-You karate student, huh?
- Yeah.

295
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,352
- Welcome to Okinawa.
- Thanks.

296
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,688
I hope your stay here
is a pleasant one.

297
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,187
How you know I be here today?

298
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,899
Okinawa very small place.

299
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,828
Village south.

300
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,290
Why, please, we go north now?

301
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:48,084
Some things have changed
since you go, Miyagi-san.

302
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,420
And some things have not, eh?

303
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,819
Out!

304
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,375
- What's goin' on?
- No talking!

305
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,675
Uncle.

306
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,886
Uncle!

307
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,446
Sato.

308
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,451
So, coward...

309
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:05,453
you return.

310
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,082
To settle affairs with Father.

311
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,876
And with me.

312
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,547
Sato, I no fight you.

313
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:21,678
Then you die as you have lived:
a coward!

314
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:30,145
You see your father.

315
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:31,938
Then you see me!

316
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,552
- What are you gonna do?
- Find taxi.

317
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,721
No. About Sato.

318
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:07,056
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

319
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,516
Nothing.

320
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,988
All this because you had to go and tell
everybody you were gonna marry yukie?

321
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:26,868
Why didn't you just marry her
and move to Alaska?

322
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,704
Daniel-san, nobody perfect.

323
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:48,556
- Where you goin', buddy?
- Tomi Village.

324
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,975
Tomi Village?
Never heard of it.

325
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:53,144
This is Kadena Air Base.

326
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,188
Sarge, Tomi Village?

327
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:58,733
You're standing on it, Corporal!
Get 'em outta here!

328
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:00,735
Just take that road
and make a right.

329
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:11,120
Miyagi remember first time
father teach fishing...

330
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:13,790
right off this point.

331
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,543
Was 1 927.

332
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,421
Was much quieter then.

333
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:55,039
Thanks a lot.

334
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,140
Take off shoes.

335
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,657
Auntie Yukie said you would come.

336
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:32,368
Yukie-- Where is she?

337
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,955
Nursing yourfather.

338
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,586
- I'm Daniel.
- I am Kumiko.

339
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,546
- Please.
- Thank you.

340
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:45,859
He sleeping.

341
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:57,829
How you know where to find me?

342
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,835
Have known for many years.

343
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,715
Why you never write sooner?

344
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:12,760
Out of respect.

345
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,515
For husband.

346
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:21,436
For your silence.

347
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:26,441
I never marry.

348
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,923
What did he say?

349
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:55,220
" If I am dreaming,
let me never awake.

350
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:00,391
Ifl am awake,
let me never sleep."

351
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:52,569
Good morning.

352
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,406
You're Yukie.

353
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:59,117
- You Daniel-san.
- Yes.

354
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,119
Mr. Miyagi's told me
a lot about you.

355
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:05,540
And he tell me lot about you.

356
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:08,835
- There's not that much to tell.
- Oh, no, no.

357
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:11,671
He very...

358
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,423
proud of you.

359
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:18,845
How's his father feeling?

360
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,599
Very tired.

361
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:26,603
Miyagi Sensei in dojo.

362
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:30,857
Thank you.
See you later.

363
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:55,840
Oh, good morning, Daniel-san.

364
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,509
Good morning.

365
00:36:57,592 --> 00:37:00,512
Welcome to Miyagi family dojo.
You like?

366
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:02,639
It's great.

367
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:05,016
This is really somethin'.
Who are all these guys?

368
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,726
All Miyagi ancestor.

369
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,938
Four hundred year worth.

370
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:11,981
And who's that?

371
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:15,485
That is Miyagi Shimpo Sensei.

372
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:18,780
First Miyagi
bring karate to Okinawa.

373
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:22,617
- The one who went to China.
- Hai. 1 625.

374
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:25,912
- How did he get there? By boat?
- By accident.

375
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:29,999
Like all Miyagi,
Shimpo Sensei was fisherman.

376
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,543
Love fishing.

377
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,294
Love saki.

378
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:37,132
One day, strong wind, strong sun...

379
00:37:37,215 --> 00:37:40,844
strong saki, but no fish.

380
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:44,848
Shimpo Sensei fall asleep
off coast ofOkinawa...

381
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:47,642
wake up off coast ofChina.

382
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:52,355
Ten year later, he come back
with Chinese wife and two kids...

383
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:54,899
and secret...

384
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:57,360
of Miyagi family karate.

385
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,739
This is the secret
of your family's karate?

386
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:06,161
- I don't get it.
- Practice. You will.

387
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:08,163
Come. We go work.

388
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:11,291
What are these things?

389
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:13,960
These rules to karate.

390
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:18,840
Rule number one:
" Karate for defense only."

391
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:23,887
Rule number two:

392
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,723
" First learn rule number one."

393
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:49,412
Yeah, coming.

394
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:59,839
This looks like a town
that time forgot.

395
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:09,182
I thinkwe went school together.
I'd introduce you, but I forget name.

396
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:14,145
How come if this is a fishing village,
I don't see anybody fishing?

397
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:16,147
Yukie-san tell me...

398
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:20,652
after war, Sato father
bring in commercial fishing boat.

399
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:25,740
Inside two year, all fish gone.
All small boat gone.

400
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:31,246
Almost everything gone,
except old cannery...

401
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:33,998
and lots of memories.

402
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:36,042
Ah, lchiro.

403
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,336
When I left, he was same place...

404
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:42,799
doing same thing,
playing same tune.

405
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:52,225
- That's a shrine, right?
- Hai. Shinto shrine.

406
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:56,646
It must be tough times
with all the fish gone, huh?

407
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,815
Very tough.

408
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:02,610
Most people leavevillage for city,
look for work.

409
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:06,114
My father, some others,
invent whole new economy.

410
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:09,659
Go into vegetable business,
save what was left ofvillage.

411
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:11,661
Everyone owns
their own little farm?

412
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:14,747
No. Sato own. Village rent.

413
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:16,791
- That's a bummer.
- You're right.

414
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,419
Familiar face.

415
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:23,089
After school, Kumiko teach
O-bon dance to kids.

416
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:41,900
O-bon dance. It's for the festival
in honor of the dead, right?

417
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,359
Very good!

418
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:45,904
I remember reading about it last night.

419
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:50,074
What is that, a pillbox?
Probably left over from World War ll.

420
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:54,454
It must have been terrible here.
1 5,000 Americans killed in ten days.

421
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:59,083
Yeah. And 1 50,000 Okinawan
and Japanese.

422
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:02,170
Why we all so stupid?

423
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:37,413
You have seen Father?

424
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:41,126
Then we finish tonight.

425
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:45,296
I bring a nephew for witness.

426
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:49,968
Then you and nephew both
lose sleep tonight. I not be there.

427
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:51,970
Your teacher coward!

428
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:58,059
You leave me no choice.

429
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:13,408
Wait a second.

430
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,707
Your father.

431
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,460
He want you.

432
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:26,463
And you, too.

433
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:30,485
Out of respect for my teacher...

434
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:33,863
I give you three days to mourn.

435
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:42,413
When finish, I come back.

436
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:46,042
You prepare to join him.

437
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:15,567
You know,
when my father died...

438
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:19,779
I spent a lot of time
thinking I wasn't such a great son.

439
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:25,493
Like maybe
I could have listened more...

440
00:46:27,078 --> 00:46:30,123
spent more time
with him together.

441
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:36,212
I felt so guilty...

442
00:46:36,254 --> 00:46:41,092
Iike he did everything for me
and I didn't do anything for him.

443
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:55,148
Then one day I realized, I did the
greatest thing for him before he died.

444
00:46:57,692 --> 00:47:00,612
I was there with him...

445
00:47:00,653 --> 00:47:03,406
and I held his hand...

446
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:05,617
and I said good-bye.

447
00:47:57,877 --> 00:48:01,131
Very good, Daniel-san.
Time for next lesson.

448
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,800
All right!

449
00:48:08,221 --> 00:48:10,181
I don't get something.

450
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:14,435
If Sato hates you so much,
why does he give you time to mourn?

451
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:16,437
My father was his teacher.

452
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:19,315
Inside the heart,
Sato still know right from wrong.

453
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:21,317
He still wants to kill you.

454
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:23,444
Sometime what heart know,
head forget.

455
00:48:23,528 --> 00:48:25,905
But the guy's looking to go to war.
I don't understand.

456
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:28,449
Never stop war
by taking part in one.

457
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:31,077
I know. But what if he threw that punch?
What would you have done?

458
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:34,247
- Block.
- Think you could have?

459
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,375
- Even you could have.
- I'm not that strong.

460
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:41,254
Not matter who's stronger.
Matter who's smarter.

461
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:45,675
I guess that's why
I won the tournament.

462
00:48:45,758 --> 00:48:47,719
Good guess, Daniel-san.

463
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:57,395
From very first karate lesson,
Miyagi father always say...

464
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:00,690
" Best way to avoid punch,
no be there."

465
00:49:00,773 --> 00:49:05,403
- I don't get it.
- Miyagi say same until I work here.

466
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:09,115
Miyagi first job,
work for Sato father.

467
00:49:12,076 --> 00:49:17,290
One day, Miyagi mind on something
other than fish when empty net return.

468
00:49:22,337 --> 00:49:24,214
That was close!

469
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:27,383
Drum technique. Understand?

470
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:28,635
Yeah!

471
00:49:28,718 --> 00:49:30,595
Drum technique.

472
00:49:30,678 --> 00:49:32,806
Let me try.

473
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:36,267
Come on.Just one turn, please.

474
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:39,395
You gotta.Just one turn.

475
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:44,609
Please?

476
00:49:44,692 --> 00:49:46,736
Okay, come platform.

477
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,989
- Great.
- I go pull up hook.

478
00:49:53,743 --> 00:49:58,540
Father say use drum technique
only as last resort.

479
00:49:58,581 --> 00:50:00,208
You ready?

480
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:01,626
I'm ready.

481
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:07,632
Remember, best block, no be there.

482
00:50:07,715 --> 00:50:08,758
One...

483
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:09,801
two...

484
00:50:09,884 --> 00:50:10,927
three!

485
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:18,309
You all right?

486
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:20,353
Yeah, I'm okay.

487
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:24,524
Come. Enough for today.
Try again tomorrow.

488
00:50:32,198 --> 00:50:37,328
You know, Miyagi and Yukie
have first date here.

489
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:40,999
Remember like was yesterday.

490
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,378
Happen over load of fresh mackerel.

491
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:02,020
You all right?

492
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:05,148
Yeah. I'm sorry.
That was pretty stupid.

493
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:13,490
Miyagi say that to father
when same thing happened.

494
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:17,202
Father agree it was stupid.
Father was right.

495
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:20,580
Is there a counterpunch
in the technique?

496
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,210
Ask drum.

497
00:51:42,852 --> 00:51:45,814
Come, Daniel-san,
talk to drum later.

498
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:03,248
- Does that guy's uncle own everything?
- Almost.

499
00:52:03,331 --> 00:52:06,709
Hey! There's Miyagi the coward.

500
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:08,670
And his baby!

501
00:52:08,753 --> 00:52:11,798
- Doesn't that bother you?
- Why should it?

502
00:52:11,881 --> 00:52:14,384
People might believe it's true.

503
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:19,264
Daniel-san, lie become truth
only if person want to believe it.

504
00:52:20,515 --> 00:52:22,934
Is that another
old Okinawan saying?

505
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:25,478
No. New Okinawan saying.

506
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:27,230
How new?

507
00:52:28,314 --> 00:52:30,275
About ten seconds.

508
00:52:35,613 --> 00:52:37,115
Are you okay?

509
00:52:37,198 --> 00:52:39,909
I'll get it for you.

510
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:41,452
Carrots, right?

511
00:52:49,752 --> 00:52:51,045
I'll get it.

512
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,853
Your little teacher
should get hearing aid.

513
00:53:06,936 --> 00:53:10,482
- Maybe you need one, too.
- I only hear what's worth listening to.

514
00:53:11,816 --> 00:53:14,903
Look out! We're working here.

515
00:53:14,986 --> 00:53:16,905
What is this?

516
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:22,994
So, you cheat people!

517
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:25,997
Shame! You cheat! You cheat!

518
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,000
We'll talk sometime
when you're not so busy.

519
00:53:38,301 --> 00:53:41,721
You still remember our song?

520
00:53:43,389 --> 00:53:45,433
Sing for me.

521
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:49,979
Yukie, I no sing long time.

522
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:52,857
Please. Please.

523
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:09,541
Oh, we were so young then.

524
00:54:09,624 --> 00:54:14,003
Yukie, why you never marry?

525
00:54:14,045 --> 00:54:16,297
You never come back.

526
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,676
You knew I would not.

527
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,221
Yes, I knew.

528
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:29,060
My father...

529
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:34,899
he ever tell you about
how he feel when I leave?

530
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:39,571
One time.

531
00:54:41,197 --> 00:54:47,120
He say he love you very much...

532
00:54:47,203 --> 00:54:48,913
and...

533
00:54:51,249 --> 00:54:53,918
what you did was right.

534
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:02,510
Except for one thing.

535
00:55:06,222 --> 00:55:09,100
I should have taken you with me.

536
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:41,591
Hello.

537
00:55:43,885 --> 00:55:46,930
- I am disturbing you?
- What? No, not at all.

538
00:55:47,013 --> 00:55:48,973
What are you doing?

539
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:52,477
- I was practicing some moves. See?
- What are moves?

540
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,815
It's like karate.
I'm trying to figure this thing out.

541
00:55:56,898 --> 00:55:58,817
Looks like O-bon dance.

542
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:01,528
Then I must be doing
something wrong.

543
00:56:02,612 --> 00:56:04,781
Doing something right. Look.

544
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:29,305
- Wow. Where'd you learn that?
- From my auntie.

545
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:30,932
That's terrific.

546
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,893
You try.

547
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:37,188
No, not me. I was absent
the day they taught graceful.

548
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:39,315
You were what?

549
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:41,526
Forget it, it's a bad joke.

550
00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:43,153
I'll try it.

551
00:56:43,236 --> 00:56:44,696
Good.

552
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:53,538
Wait a sec.

553
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:57,750
Right...

554
00:56:57,834 --> 00:56:59,919
and left.

555
00:57:17,353 --> 00:57:18,938
We're a hit.

556
00:57:20,523 --> 00:57:23,318
Maybe we could
take it on the road.

557
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,613
But we are on the road.

558
00:57:26,696 --> 00:57:29,115
You dance very nice.

559
00:57:29,157 --> 00:57:31,576
Like geisha.

560
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:33,203
Let's go.

561
00:57:33,286 --> 00:57:36,831
His little teacher's favorite
technique, huh? " Let's go."

562
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:40,627
Hey, come on, give me
the drum back, please.

563
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,629
You mean the baby rattle?

564
00:57:42,712 --> 00:57:45,507
Why don't baby come take it back?

565
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:48,927
Stop!

566
00:57:50,386 --> 00:57:53,014
Are you okay?

567
00:57:53,097 --> 00:57:57,143
You insult my honor again...

568
00:57:57,227 --> 00:57:58,978
and I kill you.

569
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:19,582
You keep for your collection.

570
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:22,502
I know you like it.

571
00:58:29,926 --> 00:58:31,886
Are you all right?

572
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,389
Yeah, I'm okay.

573
00:58:41,354 --> 00:58:46,359
He cheats these people, and I'm
insulting his honor. I don't get it.

574
00:58:46,442 --> 00:58:48,361
He has no idea what honor is.

575
00:58:48,444 --> 00:58:51,114
I kinda got that feeling.

576
00:58:51,197 --> 00:58:55,076
Ever since we were children,
he has always been the same.

577
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,122
This is the first time I had somebody
ever tell me they're gonna kill me.

578
00:58:59,205 --> 00:59:01,749
This is ridiculous.
I gotta talk to him.

579
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:06,129
He would only take it as a sign
of weakness and try to hurt you again.

580
00:59:06,212 --> 00:59:08,173
You got any ideas?

581
00:59:09,215 --> 00:59:10,675
Avoid him.

582
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:14,679
I think I'm on the wrong island.

583
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,849
What's going on here?

584
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,809
Tea ceremony.

585
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:25,562
I guess it's an old ritual.

586
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:33,070
It means that they
are falling in love again.

587
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:20,534
- Daniel-san!
- I've been looking for you.

588
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,036
Been here trying
to fix refrigerator.

589
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,289
What's wrong with it?

590
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:29,209
This. Gotta go Naha City
for new part.

591
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,753
You like come?

592
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:35,382
I was supposed to go sightseeing
with Kumiko, but I could go.

593
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:37,926
- You go, have good time.
- We could go tomorrow.

594
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:40,971
- No, I see you later.
- We don't have plans.

595
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:43,974
Never keep lady waiting.

596
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:48,645
I'll remember that.
I'll see you later.

597
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:51,440
Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.

598
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,710
Be careful.

599
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,340
This reminds me of the Palisades.

600
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,383
Palisades? Where's that?

601
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:21,678
It's in New Jersey,
where I used to live.

602
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,097
Is it pretty?

603
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,224
Some of it.

604
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:31,563
There it is! The ruins
of the castle of King Shohashi.

605
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,357
The Peace King.

606
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:36,276
- You know King Shohashi?
- Not personally.

607
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,738
Name of it is--

608
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,615
Now Sato owns it.

609
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,452
In old days, O-bon dance
was held here, but no more.

610
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,038
Now every piece goes away.

611
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:52,292
Sato, he sells it to museums.

612
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,252
Sounds like him.

613
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,716
Legend is, if you race up to the castle
and win, your wish will come true.

614
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,427
Yeah? I'll give you a head start.

615
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:04,680
Not necessary, thank you.

616
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,640
Excuse me.

617
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,725
Ready, set, go!

618
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:28,120
- I won!
- You cheated!

619
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,205
And you know you did.

620
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:35,252
We'll share the wish.

621
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:37,212
Close your eyes.

622
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:57,691
Know what I wanna know? What do you
wanna do with your life, your dreams?

623
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,068
Okay, I'll show you my dream.

624
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:03,572
I still can't get used to people driving
on the wrong side of the street.

625
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:06,742
- What side do you drive on?
- On the right side.

626
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:10,412
- I didn't know that.
- Everybody drives on the right side.

627
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:13,373
- Not everybody.
- That's what I'm learning.

628
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:23,008
You want to sell TVs for a living?

629
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:26,970
What? Interested in electronics?
I don't understand.

630
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:29,890
There.

631
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:32,643
That is my dream.

632
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:35,854
- You want to be a dancer!
- Very much.

633
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,732
That's a great thing to be.

634
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,859
Where do you study?

635
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:44,947
No schools for this kind of dancing
in Okinawa.

636
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,573
What a drag!

637
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:51,244
Come to the dance tonight.
Oh, bring your friend.

638
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,705
- Okay.
- Good. See you there.

639
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:58,251
- Like to go to dance?
- Sure. That's Sato's dojo.

640
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:03,590
I want to check that out.
Come on.

641
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:06,051
Not inside.
Chozen teaches in there.

642
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:11,556
I'm not going inside. I just wanna look
through the window. He won't see me.

643
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:14,434
He teach American military police
in there.

644
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:15,936
Really?

645
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:30,784
He's not bad.

646
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:32,995
He is Sato's number-one student.

647
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:34,663
I can see why.

648
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:36,957
We must go.
He may see you.

649
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:48,552
Maybe we'll run into
Mr. Miyagi here.

650
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,637
Oh? Why would he be here?

651
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:54,349
He said he had to come into town
to get a part for his refrigerator.

652
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,603
Oh! I know that store.
It's at the corner.

653
01:04:57,686 --> 01:05:00,522
- Maybe we will see him.
- Good!

654
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,694
What's going on in here?

655
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:08,655
This bad place.
We don't want to go in here.

656
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:11,491
Let's check it out.

657
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:35,182
Come on, baby,
give me the money.

658
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:37,851
I've got 45 here.
Come on, baby.

659
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:43,565
Show me you can do it.
Show me you can do it.

660
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:46,068
Yeah! I got 40!

661
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:48,070
The guy's standing wrong.

662
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,823
-See? I told you. You must use your hip.
-But he looks so strong.

663
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:55,285
No, you gotta be strong here, not here.
It doesn't make a difference.

664
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:58,830
You think you can do better,
big mouth?

665
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:00,874
You think you can do better?

666
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,919
- I don't know.
- Let's find out, huh?

667
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:07,255
- Maybe some other time.
- There is no other time!

668
01:06:07,339 --> 01:06:11,510
Whatever problems Mr. Miyagi has with
your uncle, they don't have to be ours.

669
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:14,888
No. We have our own, huh?

670
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:19,309
- Kumiko, where are you going?
- You go nowhere!

671
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:22,104
Call my uncle.
You will take bets.

672
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:26,108
Yosh! I give three to one, eh?

673
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:29,945
No, no, I'm not doing it!

674
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:34,700
You have a choice:
broken ice or broken neck.

675
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:36,952
He's got to break all three, right?

676
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:40,414
Wrong! All six!

677
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:44,251
All the bets in.

678
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:47,713
Not all bets. Not yet.

679
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:51,133
Boy, am I glad to see you!

680
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,885
No worry, nothing.
Miyagi fix everything.

681
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:55,387
What odds?

682
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:58,098
Three to one he does not make
through ice.

683
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:00,976
- How many pieces?
- Six.

684
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,395
Come on, let's get out of here.

685
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:07,149
$600 say he break all six.

686
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,442
600 bucks?

687
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:13,447
- I cannot cover that.
- You are covered.

688
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:18,660
Now we have bet.

689
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,205
All right! Give me your money.

690
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:25,417
Hey, I can't believe this.

691
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,878
I won't be able to break that.

692
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:31,673
He tried twice and only got through two.
What do you expect me to do?

693
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:33,133
Focus.

694
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,052
Great, and what are you gonna do?

695
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:36,720
Pray.

696
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,308
You got it. All bets are in.

697
01:08:36,989 --> 01:08:40,075
We do not honor bet with coward.

698
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,703
Do not embarrass uncle again.

699
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:53,338
Thank you, Sato.

700
01:08:53,422 --> 01:08:56,091
Pleasure do business with you.

701
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:04,224
You knew it all along, didn't you?
You didn't have a doubt in your mind.

702
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:07,811
-No doubt.
-Howwill we spend it? What will we get?

703
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:12,107
You get college tuition.
We get Chinese food. Come.

704
01:09:27,581 --> 01:09:31,084
I thought you have date.

705
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:33,420
Yeah. I was waiting for Kumiko.

706
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:36,089
I wish you had one of these back home.
This place is terrific.

707
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:39,676
No use weapon for duster.

708
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,721
This old rag?

709
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,306
Drop old rag.

710
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,475
- Why?
- Drop.

711
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:51,480
- What I see?
- I don't--

712
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,735
- Primary target.
- Primary target. A little close.

713
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,448
This is foryou.
Dance clothes.

714
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:13,168
Come on! We waiting foryou.

715
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:19,299
My uncle say your
three days mourning over.

716
01:10:19,383 --> 01:10:21,760
I have been sent to get you.

717
01:10:22,678 --> 01:10:26,431
Tell uncle I am farmer,
not fighter.

718
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:58,964
Sensei, a visitor to see you.

719
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:16,148
Is that same wood
we find together on beach?

720
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:18,692
Same. What you want?

721
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:22,279
Come make peace between us.

722
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:24,865
You forget. You betray me.

723
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:28,201
I was only 1 8 years old.

724
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:30,912
And responsible for own action.

725
01:11:30,996 --> 01:11:33,206
It explain why I leave.

726
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,876
Fear is why you leave.

727
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:38,962
Sato, I beg you.

728
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:41,381
Your fear make air stink.

729
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:48,889
What has happened to you?

730
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:25,217
Isn't this great?

731
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,219
Yeah, it's nice.

732
01:12:27,302 --> 01:12:30,514
Are you still worried about
what happened this afternoon?

733
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:35,602
I came here to help Mr. Miyagi.
And all this stuff, I feel so helpless.

734
01:12:35,686 --> 01:12:37,437
Nothing you can do.

735
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:38,939
I guess.

736
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:40,941
Can you dance like this?

737
01:12:40,983 --> 01:12:42,526
I can try.

738
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:44,987
- One, two, three, four. Got it?
- I think so.

739
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:38,707
Hey, you're very good.

740
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:42,294
You tease me.
You're a great dancer.

741
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:47,132
Wanna get something to drink?
Sit down?

742
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:49,259
Where did you learn
to dance like that?

743
01:13:49,343 --> 01:13:52,179
I've been my mom's practice partner
foryears.

744
01:13:52,262 --> 01:13:54,514
She must be a good teacher.

745
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:56,683
Yeah, she's great.
Have a seat.

746
01:13:56,767 --> 01:13:59,978
- Okay, thanks.
- Oh, man.

747
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:05,609
- You feeling better now?
- Much better, thanks.

748
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:07,444
That's good.

749
01:14:10,405 --> 01:14:14,826
Hey, can I ask you something?

750
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,870
Sure.

751
01:14:16,954 --> 01:14:18,664
It's, you know...

752
01:14:18,747 --> 01:14:22,751
it's kind of personal, though.

753
01:14:27,214 --> 01:14:29,383
Are you--

754
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:32,803
Are you arranged like, you know?

755
01:14:32,886 --> 01:14:34,638
Arranged?

756
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,516
To marry somebody?

757
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:42,145
Oh! No. That's an old custom.

758
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:45,607
Whoever I marry is up to me.

759
01:14:45,691 --> 01:14:47,776
Well, that's good.

760
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:50,404
Are you arranged?

761
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:53,532
What, are you kiddin'?
I'm a free agent.

762
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:56,493
What is free agent?

763
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:59,162
That just means that I'm available.

764
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:02,749
That's good.

765
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:05,460
Yeah.

766
01:15:13,969 --> 01:15:17,139
Oh, no, not again.
I'm not lookin' for any trouble.

767
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:19,141
Maybe trouble looking foryou.

768
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:21,059
What do you want from me?

769
01:15:21,143 --> 01:15:23,061
My money back.

770
01:15:31,403 --> 01:15:33,488
Come on, man,
that's all my money.

771
01:15:33,572 --> 01:15:35,949
No. All my money.

772
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:45,334
Don't worry about your little friend.
We take her home.

773
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:00,557
Thank you.

774
01:16:02,267 --> 01:16:03,769
Come on!

775
01:16:04,937 --> 01:16:07,606
Comin' through! Look out.

776
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:11,944
Sorry.

777
01:16:13,028 --> 01:16:14,613
You got the keys?

778
01:17:00,951 --> 01:17:03,203
Miyagi, come out.

779
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:10,377
We fight now!

780
01:17:46,288 --> 01:17:48,874
What are you guys doin' here?

781
01:17:48,957 --> 01:17:51,084
Where Miyagi?

782
01:17:51,168 --> 01:17:52,628
I don't know.

783
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,843
Leave him message for me.

784
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:01,720
With pleasure.

785
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:09,686
Come here.
I want to show you something.

786
01:18:47,516 --> 01:18:51,687
Your sensei teach you
how to fight with spear?

787
01:18:58,026 --> 01:18:59,278
Too bad.

788
01:19:01,238 --> 01:19:04,116
Maybe he teach you
how to be coward.

789
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:06,868
Hey, Mr. Coward.

790
01:19:18,714 --> 01:19:20,465
Leave message.

791
01:19:35,856 --> 01:19:38,025
This your teacher's fault.

792
01:19:38,108 --> 01:19:42,195
If he were man with honor,
you would live.

793
01:19:42,279 --> 01:19:44,364
But he's not.

794
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:00,547
Enough!

795
01:20:02,132 --> 01:20:05,552
Uncle problem with Miyagi,
not with boy.

796
01:20:05,636 --> 01:20:09,932
No, you have problem, old man,
with me.

797
01:21:03,277 --> 01:21:04,903
Act of coward!

798
01:21:09,783 --> 01:21:11,618
Daniel-san, you okay?

799
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:14,162
He was really gonna kill me.

800
01:21:16,665 --> 01:21:18,125
Come.

801
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,299
Miyagi make tea.
Make you feel better.

802
01:21:25,382 --> 01:21:28,343
Tomorrow we go home.

803
01:22:10,886 --> 01:22:15,724
I did not want for us
to end this way again.

804
01:22:17,768 --> 01:22:20,437
I would stay if could.

805
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:23,148
I know.

806
01:22:45,379 --> 01:22:50,384
Yukie, what can I do
to ease your pain?

807
01:22:58,642 --> 01:23:00,852
Take me with you.

808
01:23:25,294 --> 01:23:26,795
Whatcha doin'?

809
01:23:29,006 --> 01:23:30,674
Old custom.

810
01:23:32,092 --> 01:23:34,845
When fishermen
would go out to sea...

811
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:38,890
families would offer
rice to the gods.

812
01:23:39,975 --> 01:23:42,269
For a good catch?

813
01:23:44,104 --> 01:23:46,356
For a quick return.

814
01:23:53,614 --> 01:23:55,991
Thought any more
about dance school?

815
01:23:57,409 --> 01:24:01,496
I told you.
No schools for that here.

816
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:03,999
Well, there are in the States.

817
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:07,127
My home is here.

818
01:24:10,172 --> 01:24:12,591
Home is where you hang your hat.

819
01:24:15,844 --> 01:24:18,513
You think I would like America?

820
01:24:18,597 --> 01:24:21,016
I think you would love it.

821
01:24:23,852 --> 01:24:26,563
Do you think it would love me?

822
01:24:28,899 --> 01:24:32,027
I know one part of it
that already does.

823
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:42,037
- What's goin' on?
- Let's go see.

824
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,039
Okay, come on.

825
01:25:12,651 --> 01:25:15,112
What are you doing?

826
01:25:15,195 --> 01:25:17,281
I sell land.

827
01:25:17,322 --> 01:25:18,699
Why?

828
01:25:18,782 --> 01:25:20,742
Why do you think?

829
01:25:20,784 --> 01:25:22,744
You will destroy village?

830
01:25:22,786 --> 01:25:25,372
No, you will!

831
01:25:37,175 --> 01:25:39,011
You win.

832
01:25:40,387 --> 01:25:42,431
I fight you.

833
01:25:44,766 --> 01:25:46,435
One condition.

834
01:25:46,518 --> 01:25:49,896
No matter whowin...

835
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:53,817
title to land
pass tovillage forever.

836
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:56,737
You ask fortoo much.

837
01:25:56,820 --> 01:26:00,324
Small price to pay
foryour honor.

838
01:26:02,284 --> 01:26:05,954
You're right. Small price.

839
01:26:06,038 --> 01:26:09,958
I see you here midnight.

840
01:26:18,342 --> 01:26:22,804
Miyagi, I wait long time forthis.

841
01:26:23,889 --> 01:26:25,474
No tricks tonight.

842
01:26:25,557 --> 01:26:29,645
Ortomorrow everything gone!

843
01:26:31,396 --> 01:26:34,691
Their homes, their church...

844
01:26:34,733 --> 01:26:37,277
everything gone!

845
01:26:53,794 --> 01:26:55,212
What's this?

846
01:26:55,295 --> 01:26:57,547
Last will and testament.

847
01:26:57,631 --> 01:27:03,261
Yukie get house here.
You get house and pickup back home.

848
01:27:03,345 --> 01:27:06,223
I don't want the house
and the pickup. I want you.

849
01:27:06,306 --> 01:27:08,517
Can't we call this off?
Why don't we just leave?

850
01:27:12,562 --> 01:27:15,023
Impossible, Daniel-san.

851
01:27:15,065 --> 01:27:18,026
Just forget about
the honor garbage.

852
01:27:19,152 --> 01:27:22,364
Have nothing to do
with honor garbage.

853
01:27:22,447 --> 01:27:25,325
This have to do
with village survival.

854
01:27:25,409 --> 01:27:29,162
This isn't three points and you're out.
If you lose, I know what happens.

855
01:27:31,081 --> 01:27:33,458
Miyagi already win.

856
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:37,838
No matter what happen,
village safe forever.

857
01:29:08,178 --> 01:29:10,222
So, is this seat taken?

858
01:29:17,062 --> 01:29:18,939
I'm sorry.

859
01:32:20,203 --> 01:32:21,663
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

860
01:32:21,705 --> 01:32:26,084
- Quickly. There's danger. We must go.
- Why? I don't understand.

861
01:32:26,168 --> 01:32:29,546
Big storm. Be here soon.
Not safe here.

862
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:32,174
- Where are we going now?
- Back to village.

863
01:33:18,011 --> 01:33:20,931
Mr. Miyagi, wait up!

864
01:33:21,014 --> 01:33:23,809
Do you believe all this wind?
This is wild.

865
01:33:23,850 --> 01:33:25,477
And it get wilder.

866
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:41,910
Are those people out there?

867
01:33:44,204 --> 01:33:46,707
Come. We go help.

868
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:58,635
Stay there!
We coming! Stay there!

869
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:00,846
They need our help.

870
01:34:00,929 --> 01:34:03,181
Are you all right?
You okay?

871
01:34:03,265 --> 01:34:05,267
I got baby.

872
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:07,311
I got the boy.

873
01:34:07,352 --> 01:34:10,188
Come on. Hang on. Hold on.

874
01:34:14,026 --> 01:34:16,820
- Oh, no!
- Sato's in there!

875
01:34:18,113 --> 01:34:20,157
Here. Take baby.

876
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:23,285
I go find Sato. Go!

877
01:34:23,368 --> 01:34:26,204
- Kumiko, take him.
- Be careful. Let's go.

878
01:34:40,927 --> 01:34:43,055
Where uncle?

879
01:34:43,096 --> 01:34:44,681
He's dead.

880
01:34:52,606 --> 01:34:55,108
Come! Must work fast!

881
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:04,952
Miyagi! Now you come to fight!

882
01:35:05,035 --> 01:35:06,411
Coward!

883
01:35:07,829 --> 01:35:10,374
Now when I am helpless!

884
01:35:10,457 --> 01:35:11,875
It won't move!

885
01:35:11,959 --> 01:35:14,878
You are lower than the storm!

886
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:17,130
Now whole village see.

887
01:35:17,172 --> 01:35:20,801
This is only way you can win.

888
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:35,732
Come, Daniel-san.
Easy, Sato.

889
01:35:35,816 --> 01:35:37,234
Easy.

890
01:35:37,317 --> 01:35:39,236
I got you, old friend.

891
01:35:42,281 --> 01:35:44,658
You'll be okay now.

892
01:35:58,213 --> 01:36:00,590
Come get me!

893
01:36:00,674 --> 01:36:02,092
Come get me!

894
01:36:02,175 --> 01:36:04,845
You take Mr. Sato back!
I'll get the girl!

895
01:36:09,182 --> 01:36:11,643
Just hang on!

896
01:36:12,811 --> 01:36:14,938
Don't let go.

897
01:36:16,481 --> 01:36:20,027
Uncle! Uncle!
I thought you were dead!

898
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:22,154
I thought you were dead.

899
01:36:22,237 --> 01:36:23,655
Go help!

900
01:36:26,658 --> 01:36:28,327
Help him!

901
01:36:34,207 --> 01:36:37,169
I cannot help him.
I cannot.

902
01:36:55,312 --> 01:36:58,357
Hang on! Just hang on!
Hold tight!

903
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:16,458
Hold on!

904
01:37:23,423 --> 01:37:26,259
Just hang on!
Give me your arm!

905
01:37:28,971 --> 01:37:30,555
Hold on tight!

906
01:37:37,562 --> 01:37:40,065
You're gonna be okay.
Hang on.

907
01:37:56,081 --> 01:37:58,458
Miyagi, let me go.

908
01:38:01,753 --> 01:38:03,422
You'll be okay.

909
01:38:06,883 --> 01:38:08,302
Thanks a lot.

910
01:38:25,652 --> 01:38:28,322
Now, to you...

911
01:38:28,405 --> 01:38:30,073
I am dead.

912
01:39:00,771 --> 01:39:02,898
How are they gonna
recover from this?

913
01:39:02,981 --> 01:39:05,525
All the seeds are gone.
The place is wrecked.

914
01:39:05,609 --> 01:39:08,278
- What are they gonna do now?
- Best they can.

915
01:39:10,989 --> 01:39:13,825
What is all this?
What's Sato doing here?

916
01:39:13,909 --> 01:39:15,535
Don't know.

917
01:39:29,132 --> 01:39:30,842
I come help rebuild.

918
01:39:31,635 --> 01:39:34,179
Here deed to village.

919
01:39:35,389 --> 01:39:38,350
Forgive me. I beg you.

920
01:39:40,811 --> 01:39:44,231
Oh, Sato.
Nothing to forgive.

921
01:39:45,315 --> 01:39:47,276
Now's a good time to ask him.

922
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:49,528
It's not my place.

923
01:39:52,906 --> 01:39:55,534
Mr. Sato, O-bon dance is soon...

924
01:39:55,617 --> 01:39:59,371
and it'll be hard the way things are
to have it here in the village.

925
01:40:00,163 --> 01:40:02,249
What you ask of me?

926
01:40:02,332 --> 01:40:06,336
Well, can they have it in the castle?
That's where it belongs, isn't it?

927
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:13,552
Your student become my teacher.

928
01:40:15,554 --> 01:40:18,140
O-bon will be held in castle.

929
01:40:18,932 --> 01:40:20,726
Now and forever!

930
01:40:22,311 --> 01:40:23,854
One condition.

931
01:40:25,522 --> 01:40:27,357
You dance with us.

932
01:40:28,817 --> 01:40:30,569
You got it.

933
01:40:39,369 --> 01:40:42,456
When you put your mind to it,
anything can happen.

934
01:40:42,539 --> 01:40:44,207
You're right.

935
01:42:07,499 --> 01:42:10,168
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be makin' a lot ofmistakes.

936
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:12,754
Ifnot for you,
I not be here.

937
01:42:18,844 --> 01:42:21,346
Now remember,
you have nothing to worry about.

938
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:23,807
I'm not worried.
I think I'm scared.

939
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:25,934
You kiddin'?
I've seen you do it.

940
01:42:26,018 --> 01:42:29,521
You're gonna be terrific.
It's true.

941
01:42:29,605 --> 01:42:32,691
- Did I tell you you look beautiful?
- No.

942
01:42:33,609 --> 01:42:35,694
Well, you do.

943
01:42:47,831 --> 01:42:50,626
I've seen her practice.
She's really amazing.

944
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:49,935
Behind you!

945
01:43:56,108 --> 01:43:57,985
Get back!

946
01:43:58,026 --> 01:44:00,112
- Get back or I'll kill her!
- Chozen!

947
01:44:00,946 --> 01:44:02,614
Don't do this.

948
01:44:02,698 --> 01:44:04,825
I was wrong.

949
01:44:04,866 --> 01:44:06,451
Hate is wrong.

950
01:44:06,493 --> 01:44:09,538
- lt's over.
- I cannot hear you, Uncle.

951
01:44:09,621 --> 01:44:12,082
I am dead to you, remember?

952
01:44:12,124 --> 01:44:15,294
Chozen, you are your uncle's
finest student.

953
01:44:15,335 --> 01:44:17,754
No disgrace him here.

954
01:44:17,838 --> 01:44:20,132
Your student disgrace me.

955
01:44:20,173 --> 01:44:22,467
I have been dishonored
all because of him.

956
01:44:22,551 --> 01:44:24,386
For whatever happened,
I apologize.

957
01:44:24,469 --> 01:44:27,180
Apology will not
give me back my honor!

958
01:44:27,222 --> 01:44:29,975
- Neither will this.
- In their eyes it will.

959
01:44:30,017 --> 01:44:33,395
No more talk.
You cross bridge, or I kill her!

960
01:44:39,526 --> 01:44:42,654
This not tournament.
This for real.

961
01:44:58,837 --> 01:45:01,340
Oy. No bridge.

962
01:45:29,868 --> 01:45:32,371
Now I dropped the bridge.
Let her go.

963
01:45:33,413 --> 01:45:36,750
- Come on!
- Now we fight to death!

964
01:46:47,487 --> 01:46:50,115
Step back, Daniel-san!
Step back!

965
01:48:30,841 --> 01:48:32,426
Live or die, man?

966
01:48:34,928 --> 01:48:36,305
Die.

967
01:48:37,889 --> 01:48:39,725
Wrong. Honk!
