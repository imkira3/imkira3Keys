00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,912
Come on, guys!
I can do this.

4
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,877
Ha-ha, didn't hurt!

5
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,536
Ha-ha!
You got nothin' on me, Bones!

6
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,879
Hey! I'm the best!

7
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,553
I'm goin' get ya now!

8
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,114
All right,
let's do this thing.

9
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,593
You can't catch me!

10
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,079
Yeah, run away!

11
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,880
Whoa!

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,275
Get outta my way!
Watch it!

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,228
Careful.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That was close.

15
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,673
Is that all you got?

16
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,876
Hi, buddy.
I told you I'd be back.

17
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,272
Wow.

18
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,320
- The truck!
- Whoo-hoo!

19
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,391
Out of my way, losers!
Hey!

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,656
- Guys, check it out.
- Wow, cool!

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,352
Yes! The winner's truck.

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,794
It's happening today?

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,359
What's happening today?
Ugh.

24
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,590
Don't you know anything,
Ferdinand?

25
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
If that truck's here,

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,558
it means the matador's
gonna pick a bull.

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,153
Who do you think
he's gonna pick?

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,390
Duh, my dad.

29
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,438
And when my horns come in,
it'll be my turn.

30
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,549
People will come
from all over Spain

31
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,235
just to see me,
the great Valiente!

32
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,631
The fiercest bull of all time.

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,792
I'll take him down big time.

34
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,519
Man versus bull.

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,395
Will it be pretty? No.

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,358
Will it be awesome? Heck yeah!

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,191
The crowd will go nuts,
making me a champ.

38
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,152
I'll spend the rest of my days
living like a king.

39
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,151
Dream on, Valiente.

40
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,311
I'm the one
who's getting selected.

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,119
I'm already
working on my victory smile.

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,719
Hey, the matador's here!

43
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,990
Where? Where? Oh, no.

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,833
I feel sick. Oh, Mama.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,798
There's no matador, Guapo.
What?

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,473
What a wimp.

47
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,910
Forget it, Guapo.
He's gonna pick me.

48
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,878
I'm the fastest, baddest
bull around.

49
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,235
I'm so fast,
they won't see me coming.

50
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,759
Bones?
Yeah?

51
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,353
You're never
gonna get selected.

52
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
You wanna know why?

53
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
Why?

54
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,990
'Cause you're a puny
bag of bones, Bones.

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
You okay?

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,472
I don't need your help,
weirdo.

57
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,595
I'm fine!

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,829
Careful.

59
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,951
Oh, what do you got there,
Ferdinand?

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,599
Uh, nothing.

61
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,113
"Uh, nothing."

62
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,317
Hey! Don't you guys have
some more headbutting to do?

63
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,630
Nah, this is way more fun.

64
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,273
Can you believe this guy?

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,720
The matador is gonna
pick a bull...

66
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,633
and all he's worried about
is a dumb flower.

67
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,639
Cut it out, Valiente!

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Make me.

69
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,150
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

70
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,556
I'm not gonna fight you,
Valiente.

71
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,794
Aw, flower bull is scared.

72
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,154
I'm not scared.

73
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,959
Then fight.
That's what bulls do.

74
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,789
You can hit me if you want,
but leave the flower alone.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,638
You're just gonna let him
smack ya?

76
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,030
What? Where's the fun in that?

77
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,278
Whatever.

78
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,191
Have your stupid flower.

79
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,958
The big bulls are going in.

80
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,958
Wish me luck, Ferdinand.

81
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,719
Good luck, Dad.

82
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,598
Go get 'em, Dad!

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,035
Come on, guys,
let's see 'em over here.

84
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,279
Out of my way!

85
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,194
Go, bulls!

86
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,598
Whoo-hoo!
Whoa!

87
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,951
It's the matador.
He's gonna pick!

88
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,032
I feel sick.
I think I'm gonna hurl.

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,953
You'll get 'em next time, Dad.

90
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,752
Who asked you?

91
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,478
What are you looking at?

92
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,800
Ferdinand!

93
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,391
Ah, there you are!

94
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,509
He picked me.
Can you believe it?

95
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,116
Your dad is gonna fight
for glory in the ring.

96
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,508
You really have to go?

97
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,717
Yeah, of course I have to go.
Come on, Ferd.

98
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,075
This is what every bull
dreams of, right?

99
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,878
I guess.

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,435
Is it okay
if it's not my dream?

101
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,393
Well, uh...

102
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,317
Look, Ferd,
you're still a kid, you know.

103
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,193
When you grow up,
your dreams are gonna change.

104
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,879
Everything's gonna change.

105
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,696
I'll tell you one thing
that's gonna change...

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,576
you're gonna be bigger
and tougher than your old man,

107
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
that's for sure.

108
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,591
No way.
Yes way.

109
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,273
Yeah.
And then you'll see...

110
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,536
you're gonna get in that ring

111
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,913
and you are gonna
be the champ.

112
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,271
Can I be a champ
without fighting maybe?

113
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,432
Oh, Ferdinand.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,833
I really wish the world
worked like that for you,

115
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,194
I do.

116
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,752
But that's just
not how it is for us.

117
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,512
You understand?

118
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,508
Okay, it's time.

119
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,430
You're gonna come back, right?

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,149
What? That matador
doesn't stand a chance, okay?

121
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,475
Okay.

122
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,676
And after I win,
I'm coming back here,

123
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,352
and I'm gonna show you
all my moves.

124
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,909
Even my secret ones.

125
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,674
Dad!

126
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,919
Dad.

127
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,799
I called it.

128
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,871
That bull was soft.

129
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,474
And the soft ones
always go down.

130
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,958
You better bull up.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,036
Oh, hey, what are you
doing out here?

132
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,950
Come on. Get back, get back.

133
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,559
Come back to the stall.

134
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,880
Come on, little guy.

135
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,671
A calf is out! Get him!

136
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,718
Get him!

137
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,599
It's okay.

138
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,630
Shh. It's okay.

139
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,392
Hi, there.

140
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,319
Don't be afraid,
little big guy.

141
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
Oh.

142
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,151
You like flowers?

143
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,197
I'll take good care of you.

144
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,114
Come on.

145
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,595
This is your home now.

146
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,074
Go on. It's okay.

147
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Always out of place

148
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,874
I knew I needed
something new for me

149
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,633
I never knew just
what that was

150
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,392
Okay, your turn.

151
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,795
Finding something safe
was just like

152
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,836
Trying to catch
a bird in flight

153
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,832
I knew that I would
never touch

154
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,439
Who's my good boy?
You're my good boy.

155
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,352
Hey, I thought
I was the good boy.

156
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,592
Good night, Ferdinand.

157
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,513
'Cause I'm happy
to call this

158
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,314
Home
No more running

159
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,274
I'm good knowing

160
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,998
That I belong
Happy to call this

161
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,034
Home
I got loving

162
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,759
Ferdinand!

163
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,469
Don't care who knows it
Happy to call this

164
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,593
Home

165
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,592
Oh, yeah, oh

166
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,829
Ugh!

167
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,072
Being me was hard enough

168
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,720
So being someone else
was too much

169
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,268
All I want is something real

170
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,593
Now I won't let go

171
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,959
'Cause I'm happy
to call this

172
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,675
Home
No more running

173
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,039
I'm good knowing

174
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,797
That I belong
Happy to call this

175
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,399
Whoo-hoo!

176
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,834
Oh, eh, oh

177
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,229
Oh, yeah
Oh, eh, oh

178
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,198
Boy, I'm happy to call this

179
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,395
Whoo!

180
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,152
Home is where you're happy

181
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,309
Good night, Ferdinand.

182
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,789
Find where you're happy

183
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,717
'Cause I'm happy
to call this

184
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,112
Home

185
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,956
Jorge, rise and shine, buddy.

186
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,119
Come on, Jorge, wake up!
Let's go!

187
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,112
Music to my ears.

188
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,713
Ah, it's gonna be a good one.

189
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,677
Oh, I can feel it
in my horns.

190
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,989
Hey, Paco!

191
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,915
Paco!

192
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,275
Pac-attack. Hey, dawg.

193
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,913
You stoked about the big day?

194
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,913
Stoked?
Have you ever seen me stoked?

195
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,832
Look, I've got some bad news.

196
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,319
Gonna stop you right there.

197
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,311
No bad news allowed

198
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,233
'cause today
is Flower Festival day.

199
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,436
Only the greatest day
of the year.

200
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,079
Okay, that's the thing.

201
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,593
This year...
Hold that thought.

202
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,159
Hey, Maria. You ready to put

203
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,356
those wings to work?

204
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,590
Hey, hey, hey. I just finished
herding those chickens.

205
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
Launch.

206
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,715
Maria?

207
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,114
Oh, no. Maria?

208
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,032
Congratulations.
Maria!

209
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,270
You shot Maria into the sun.

210
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,159
Oh, way to go, Maria.

211
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,038
Who says a chicken can't fly?

212
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,078
Uh, the laws of nature say it.
I say it.

213
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,958
Chickens are chickens.
Here we go.

214
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,429
Dogs are dogs, and...
Bulls are bulls.

215
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,511
Yeah. Right. Normal.

216
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,432
Hey, if was a normal bull,

217
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,317
I would have never
found this farm.

218
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,959
And we wouldn't be brothers.

219
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,390
A dog and a bull
can't be brothers.

220
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,515
That would be weird.

221
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,874
Really?

222
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,473
Then why does your tail wag

223
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,949
when I call you brother,
Brother?

224
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,069
- Hey. Stop that.
- Hah!

225
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,991
Looks like weird
is the new normal, buddy.

226
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,896
Come on, before everybody
takes off without us.

227
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,989
Ferdinand, wait!

228
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,355
This is what
I've been trying to tell you.

229
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,756
There you are.

230
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,194
You ready to go?

231
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,674
I'm sorry, Nina.

232
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,194
Ferdinand can't come
to the festival this year.

233
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,478
But he goes with us
every year.

234
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,837
I know, but he is not
a little calf anymore.

235
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,791
Then I won't go either.

236
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,109
Listen, honey.
It's for his own good.

237
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,192
But, Dad. It's just Ferdinand.

238
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,272
But outside this farm,

239
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,396
they don't know him
like we do.

240
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,950
Sorry, little big guy.

241
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,033
I'll bring you back
the prettiest bouquet in town.

242
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,269
Okay?

243
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,676
Hey, cheer up, buddy!

244
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,990
Flowers are overrated anyway!

245
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,116
Hah, you couldn't pay me
to go to that festival.

246
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,517
Hey. Why don't we bring Paco?
Fun, right?

247
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,874
I guess.

248
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,153
I am not stoked about this.
Not stoked at all.

249
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,519
This doesn't make any sense.

250
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,629
I'm not a little calf anymore,
so what?

251
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,193
More of me to love.

252
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,272
And besides,
bigger bull, bigger helper.

253
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,509
I'm going.

254
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,599
No. No, no. Juan said no.

255
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,671
Juan said no,
I'm not going. It's settled.

256
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,432
But Nina will be miserable
without me.

257
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,748
She needs me.

258
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,637
Ah... But I need to go,
but I need to stay.

259
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
And go. Stay. Go.

260
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,416
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do?

261
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
What do I do?

262
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,276
If that orange doesn't fall
by the time I count to three,

263
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
I'm going.

264
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
One...

265
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,435
If that rock is still there

266
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,880
by the time I...

267
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,111
What could you possibly
need that for?

268
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
Okay.

269
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,035
If that egg doesn't hatch

270
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,997
by the time I count to ten,
I'm going.

271
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,479
One...

272
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,656
Two, three, four, five, six,

273
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
seven, eight, nine, ten.

274
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,390
Whew! Didn't hatch.
Flower Festival, here I come!

275
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Oh!

276
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,512
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

277
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,952
Hey! You forgot your bike.
I'll leave it right here.

278
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Wow.

279
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,439
Oh, wow!

280
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,673
This is some next level stuff.

281
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Whoa.

282
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,315
Huh. That was odd.

283
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,231
You don't like the little
piggy balloon?

284
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,270
We'll get you
another balloon, okay?

285
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,356
Gracias, señor.

286
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Oh, nice.

287
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,798
Oh!

288
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,438
All yours, little guy.

289
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,550
Ferdinand.
You shouldn't be here.

290
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,949
What?

291
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Nina!

292
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,716
Oh. Now he acts like a bull?

293
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,234
We have a situation here.

294
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,313
It's okay. It's okay.
He won't hurt anyone.

295
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,594
My baby.
The beast got my baby.

296
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,279
A beast? Where?

297
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,032
Ow! Ow!

298
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Huh?

299
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,833
I'm coming, little baby.

300
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,719
Out of the way!

301
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,955
Whoa!

302
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,629
Got you.

303
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,998
He's a monster.

304
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,994
Keep him away.
Stay away, scary beast.

305
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,673
Ferdinand!
Paco!

306
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,068
They think I'm the beast.

307
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,356
Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

308
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,634
Get back to the farm.
I'll hold them off.

309
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,152
Hey, I'm not done
with you people.

310
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,308
Let's go this way.

311
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,873
Oh, no.

312
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Oh.

313
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,949
Okay.

314
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,792
Think thin.

315
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,193
Ooh.

316
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,437
Step light.

317
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,751
You are a feather.

318
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,195
A 2,000-pound feather.

319
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,159
Slow...

320
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,874
There he is!

321
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,319
Cash or credit?

322
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,230
No! This is not necessary.

323
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,073
You don't have to do this.

324
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,759
- It was an accident.
- Ferdinand!

325
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,111
Stop! You're hurting him.

326
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,351
Nina!

327
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,589
No!

328
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,478
Stop!
No, no, no.

329
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
Stay back. Stay back.
Please. Let me take him home.

330
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,557
He's gentle.
Gentle?

331
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,433
He's a wild animal.
Look what he's done.

332
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,431
We have to take him away,
honey.

333
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,354
Señor Moreno.

334
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,874
I think I have something
you need to see.

335
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,474
No!
Wait. Nina. Nina!

336
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,471
Stop! Please!

337
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,914
Ferdinand!

338
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Nina!

339
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,429
Ferdinand.

340
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,033
Ferdinand!

341
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,559
Ferdinand.

342
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,429
No!

343
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,834
Oh, no.
No, not back here. No, no, no.

344
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,712
This can't be happening.

345
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,752
I need to get outta here.

346
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,518
Stop the truck!
Stop the truck!

347
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,399
There's been a mistake. Stop!

348
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,789
Oy! He's going to tear
that truck apart.

349
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,632
What did I tell you,
Señor Moreno?

350
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
He's a beast.

351
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
Get the calming goat.

352
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,040
Where is the calming goat?

353
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,235
Get the calming goat.

354
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,554
Ow! Ow! Jeez Louise!

355
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,951
Real classy, guys.
Way to treat a lady.

356
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,235
Who's that?

357
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,714
Hey, big guy. Name's Lupe.

358
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,392
I'm going to be
your calming goat.

359
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,630
My calming goat?
That's right.

360
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,153
I'm here to soothe you now.

361
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,515
So you can maim
and gore things later.

362
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,877
Let's try some deep
relaxing breaths.

363
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,119
In. Out.

364
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
You're not helping.

365
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,192
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe
you're not helping.

366
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,759
You ever think of that? No.

367
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,353
Because no one
ever wants to help

368
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,998
the stinking calming goat,
right?

369
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,833
Okay, now I got
to calm myself down.

370
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,035
In. Out.

371
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,237
I need to get out!
In. Out.

372
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,472
Whoa! He is a monster.

373
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,830
I think I fell
on something sharp.

374
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,672
Move!
What?

375
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,070
Goat.
Oh!

376
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,111
Oh, sorry about that.
So sorry. So sorry.

377
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,394
Here you go. Here you go.

378
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,677
Watch it, buster.
You could have ki...

379
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,034
Whoa!

380
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,432
Holy beefaroni!
You're ginormous!

381
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,750
Listen. It's Lupe, right?

382
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,712
There's been a huge
misunderstanding.

383
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,353
I really need your help here.

384
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,910
Well, well, hold the phone.
You want my help?

385
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,957
Yeah! That would be amazing.

386
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,400
I've been waiting
for this moment

387
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,830
my whole flea-bitten,
tin-chewing life, mister!

388
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
You have?

389
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,797
Oh, yes, I have!

390
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,718
Yes, I have.

391
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,469
Believe it or not,

392
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,471
I'm not the world's
best calming goat.

393
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
No...

394
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,360
My true destiny
is to be a coach.

395
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
Okay...

396
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,148
Whoo! Look at those pecs.

397
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,677
It's like two little
baby bulls inside of a bull.

398
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,671
Moving on down the flank.

399
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,316
Flank looks good.
A-plus on the flank.

400
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,870
Mama like that.
Mama like that. Whew.

401
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
Ow!

402
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,496
Terrible reflexes.
We gotta work on that.

403
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,239
What are you talking about?
Work on what? Whoa!

404
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,233
Getting you ready for the
bullfighting ring, my friend.

405
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,719
That's why you're here, right?

406
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,269
No! Listen, I really need
to get back home.

407
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,993
This is your home.
You made it.

408
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,628
With your raw talent
and my coaching expertise...

409
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,588
we're going from
hola to olé in a day!

410
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,557
No, that is not gonna happen.

411
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,832
Oh. Stop it with the modesty.

412
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,594
You're the bull who destroyed
a whole village, right?

413
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,557
Wrong! It was an accident.

414
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,233
And did you really eat a baby?

415
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,913
You think I ate a baby?

416
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,718
Not denying it. Interesting.

417
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,275
Denying it!
Definitely denying it.

418
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,229
Whoo!
He's a brick, uh, house

419
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,635
I can't wait to show you off
to the rest of the guys.

420
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,200
They're going
to fertilize the yard.

421
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,679
No, no, no. Lupe, wait.

422
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,989
You really don't have to...

423
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Oh. Uh...

424
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,711
Hey, guys. How ya doing?

425
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,279
Lupe in the house.

426
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,754
You suck, Lupe!

427
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,356
Oh, yeah? I used to suck,
but not anymore.

428
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,271
Let me introduce you
to the new guy.

429
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,999
He's a monster
and I'm his coach.

430
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,349
And did I mention

431
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,035
that he is my closest
and dearest BFF...

432
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,474
What did you say
your name was?

433
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,551
Ferdinand? Is that you?

434
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,439
Hey!
That is a ridiculous name.

435
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,079
Tell him your real name,
killer.

436
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,071
Yeah, it's me, Ferdinand.

437
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Hey, guys.

438
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,038
Wait a minute.
You know these chumps?

439
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,430
Whoo! Little Ferdinand.

440
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,790
You've had a growth spurt.

441
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,315
Suddenly I regret every time
I called you weirdo.

442
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,636
Don't sweat it, Bones.
We're good.

443
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,598
My gosh! What have
they been feeding you?

444
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,352
Oh, hey. Guapo?

445
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,431
That's right.
The one and only.

446
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,033
Ah, I get it.

447
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,710
You try to come back here
and intimidate us?

448
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,313
'Cause let me
tell you something.

449
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,473
I am not intimidated
by your freakish hugeness!

450
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,278
Oh, mama.

451
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,589
I don't know you...

452
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,877
but I'm not scared of ya,
you sorry sack of meat.

453
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,600
You're an affront
to my nostrils.

454
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,756
Angus,
you're talking to his butt.

455
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,193
Oh.

456
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,353
I will not take any lip from
the flea-bitten likes of you,

457
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,759
you wee goat.

458
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,871
Now you're talking to my butt.

459
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,274
Aah! Go and boil your head,
ya bunch of bampos.

460
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,475
I'm away.

461
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,469
Uh, a few new faces
around here since I left, huh?

462
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,312
Hello, Maquina. Hi!

463
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,359
He was created in a lab.
A Franken-bull.

464
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,875
Says nothing, feels nothing.

465
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,154
You seem fun.

466
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,515
Look what the goat dragged in.

467
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,749
Hey, Val.

468
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,995
Valiente?

469
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,674
He remembers. Oh, I'm touched.

470
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Hey!

471
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,200
Oh. Didn't see you there,
Bones.

472
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,310
What do you mean you didn't
see me? Oh, I get it.

473
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,549
'Cause I'm small.

474
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,751
You know what you are?
A sizeist.

475
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,031
Guess some things
never change.

476
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,270
Look at you. All grown up.

477
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,560
When you ran away with your
tail between your legs...

478
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,193
I never thought
I'd see you back here.

479
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,719
That makes two of us.

480
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,995
Nah, I get it.

481
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,071
Now that
you're a big tough guy,

482
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,593
you think you're better
than me.

483
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,352
What?
Correction, Valerie.

484
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,239
Actually, he knows
he's better than you.

485
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,833
Ain't that right, F-Bomb?

486
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,194
I didn't say that.

487
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,873
You said it with your eyes.

488
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,672
Well, I'm glad you're back.

489
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,558
You are?
Oh, yeah.

490
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,678
Good to have a real bull
around here for once.

491
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,518
It'll make me look even better

492
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,194
when I beat you to a pulp
inside the ring.

493
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,191
Welcome back, Ferdinand.

494
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,719
Wow. He really hates you.
That was insane.

495
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,909
They all hate me.

496
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,397
Yeah, they hate you.
They hate me.

497
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,955
They hate each other.
A lot of hate.

498
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,112
It crushes your soul if you
let yourself think about it.

499
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Oh, well.

500
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,433
Come on, pal.
Let me show you your new digs.

501
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,280
This is the one.
Ooh.

502
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,672
Get that big butt in there.

503
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,352
Oh, that's heavy. Get in!

504
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,676
Ow!
Isn't this great?

505
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,759
It's smaller than I remember.

506
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,273
Oh, you don't like it?

507
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,510
You know where I live?
A bucket.

508
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,233
And there it is.

509
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,277
Took the liberty
of moving my stuff in,

510
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,032
hope you don't mind.

511
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,589
Wait! I know
what our place needs.

512
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,472
Little feminine touch.

513
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,790
A little something
from me to you.

514
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,353
Excusez-moi.

515
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,797
Little bit of regurgitation.

516
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,508
Nighty-night, bestie.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

517
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,238
No, seriously,
there are bed bugs

518
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,833
and they are vicious.

519
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Huh?

520
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,188
Wow. You weren't kidding
about the bugs.

521
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,616
He saw us. Stay still!

522
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,696
Hey! Why would you stop?

523
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,896
Go back.
We have to do something.

524
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,296
All right,
let's do it old school.

525
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,274
Um... Are you trying
to steal my stuff?

526
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,192
Oh, no. We'd never
do something like that.

527
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,749
Nope. Not us.
You have offended us, sir!

528
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,388
I'm sorry, little guys.
I feel terrible.

529
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,118
Ow!
Don't fall for it, Ferd.

530
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,639
They're filthy weasels.

531
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,756
Hey! We're not filthy weasels.

532
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,319
We're filthy hedgehogs.

533
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,879
She knows what we are.

534
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,838
Yeah.
Beady-eyed, little thieves.

535
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,594
We're not thieves.
We're survivors.

536
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,715
Balls!

537
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Let's roll!

538
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,836
No, wait! Hold on! The flower!

539
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,108
Please don't chew on us!

540
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,919
My greatest fear
is death by chew.

541
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,593
Step back, beast!
Come on.

542
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,358
You wanna dance? Let's dance.
Oh, hey!

543
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,919
Don't tempt me, pinecone.

544
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,149
Will you stop?
Eat quills!

545
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,276
And you,
I'm not eating anyone.

546
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,192
Ha!
Wait, wait. Hold on.

547
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,000
You're not like
the other meatheads, are you?

548
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,115
Don't be fooled, sister.

549
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,271
Where do you think the
word bully comes from, hmm?

550
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,469
It ain't from chickens!

551
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,679
No, no. Look at him!
He's soft and sweet.

552
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,274
Like butter.

553
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,431
Thanks. I think.

554
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,636
Let's start over. I'm Una.

555
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
I'm Dos.

556
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,359
And I'm Cuatro.

557
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,238
Oh. What happened to Tres?

558
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,231
We do not speak of Tres.

559
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
Oh.

560
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,829
Sorry.

561
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,514
Look, you can
take the food if you want.

562
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,715
I'm not hungry.

563
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Oh, really?

564
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,296
Whoo-hoo! You don't
have to tell me twice.

565
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,073
Ah-bup-bup-bup.
The flower stays.

566
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,960
Good-bye. For now.

567
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,428
Let me give you a boost.

568
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,033
Oh, thank you!

569
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,872
Nah, I don't know.
Ow! Okay, fine.

570
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,598
Ooh! Free ride!

571
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,035
Great to meet you!

572
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,474
What a nice bull.

573
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,709
Oh, yeah.

574
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,836
Sucker won't survive
a day in this place.

575
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,875
Hmm.

576
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,598
I gotta get back home.

577
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,919
Get back. Get back!
Ow, ow, ow. Get back!

578
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,677
Where are my teeth?

579
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,397
All right, I'm going home!

580
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
I'm going...

581
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,277
Holy cow, that hurt.

582
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,679
Face is on fire.

583
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,633
Klaus, Greta, look!

584
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,955
Looks like somebody

585
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,429
wants to come
to our side of the fence.

586
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,433
Silly moo-moo.
He doesn't know the rules.

587
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,675
Hey, can you guys help me out?

588
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,353
How do I get
to the other side?

589
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,395
Hmm. How do you get
to the other side?

590
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,273
Oh, let me ponder
this question a little bit.

591
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,515
Mmm...

592
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,955
Spoiler alert! You don't!

593
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,433
Hoof bump. Hoof bump, Klaus.
Hoof bump, Greta.

594
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,637
See, this is the beautiful
horsey side.

595
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
And that

596
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,040
is the stinky bull side.
Yeah.

597
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,071
Beautiful horsies stay here,

598
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,355
and you ugly beasts
stay there.

599
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,273
Don't even think of coming
over to our side.

600
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,713
Or we'll alert the humans.

601
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,989
Yeah.

602
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,957
Sucks to be you.

603
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,793
There is no escape.
Nothing gets past us.

604
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,029
Never ever never.

605
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,430
Never ever, ever, ever.

606
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
We have eyes

607
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,936
- on the back of our heads.
- Yeah.

608
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,393
The nose of a kitten.

609
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,033
The flexibility of a monkey.

610
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,914
Ears like that
of a cocker spaniel.

611
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
Good one.

612
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,475
Shoo! Shoo, shoo!
Go on, stinky one.

613
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,551
Have a nice day
smelling terrible.

614
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,994
Yeah.

615
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,192
I bet his parents
weren't even related.

616
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,834
Wow. People around here
are pigs. Aah!

617
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,115
Aah! Sardine can!

618
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Oh, that turned.

619
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,512
El Primero is coming.

620
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,880
El Primero is coming. Come on!

621
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,840
What?
El Primero is coming here?

622
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,749
El Primero? El Primero!

623
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,593
El Primero!
Oh. Here?

624
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,320
El Primero!

625
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,357
El Primero! El Primero!

626
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,520
El Primero!
What?

627
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,736
El Primero. El Primero.
Ow, ow, ow.

628
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
El Primero.

629
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,592
Ow!

630
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,040
El Primero.

631
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,315
Oh! Hey. Uh, sorry about that.

632
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,833
El Primero.

633
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,955
Who?

634
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,514
Big P is in the house!

635
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,955
There are many
great bullfighters in Spain...

636
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,078
but there is only one
El Primero.

637
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,470
You got this, Guap.
You got this. You got this.

638
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,279
Hey, Guapo. No pressure.

639
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,919
Oh, mama!

640
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,594
Don't let that jerk
get in your head, Guap.

641
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,159
Where is he? Show me!

642
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,456
Point me
in the right direction.

643
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,993
Excuse me.
Goat coming through.

644
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,673
El Primero.

645
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,199
Olé.

646
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,796
El Primero! Love you, man.

647
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,519
El Primero, señor!
Welcome to Casa del Toro.

648
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,193
What an honor to have you here

649
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,872
at my humble home.
Es un honor.

650
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,237
I do not shake.
My hands are my instruments.

651
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,039
As are my arms, legs,
chest, feet.

652
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,589
And buttocks.

653
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,034
¿Comprende?

654
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,753
Uh... Of course, señor.

655
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,269
I am here to select a bull.

656
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,999
¡Uno!
One?

657
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,833
My final fight. One bull.

658
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,879
The best bull.
Against the best bullfighter.

659
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,359
No, of course.
The best...

660
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,714
for the best.

661
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,056
Sí. I understand.
But we have...

662
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,071
The best against the best.
No, we will...

663
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,038
To see who's
the best-est-est-est.

664
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,176
I have a new bull. I think
will be perfect for you.

665
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
Zip!

666
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,430
Only El Primero knows
who is the best.

667
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,114
Sorry. I meant no disrespect.

668
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,278
And yet, I felt disrespected.

669
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,193
Now, what is the best bedroom
in the house?

670
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,474
Uh...

671
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,437
Mine, I suppose.

672
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,828
I'll take that one.

673
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,677
Let me know
when the bulls are ready.

674
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,878
Get the bulls ready
for Señor Primero.

675
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,188
Vamos! Vamos!

676
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,554
Okay, listen up, F-Train.

677
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,869
I've got exactly 30 seconds

678
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,456
to teach you everything
about bullfighting.

679
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,754
Number one. Don't get hit.

680
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,558
Number two.
Destroy anything that moves.

681
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,119
And number three...

682
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,856
Actually, that's it.
It's not that complicated.

683
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,915
Oh, trust me, Lupe.

684
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,798
This is not for me.
Relax, buddy.

685
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,319
It's a slam dunk!

686
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,311
El Primero is going
to take one look

687
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,994
at your big beautiful
hugeness and boom!

688
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,151
You're on your way
to the big show.

689
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,915
I can already hear the crowds
in Madrid chanting your name.

690
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,833
Lupe! Lupe! Lupe!

691
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,672
I want the new bull out first.

692
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,633
Well, well.

693
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,429
Looks like
someone's the teacher's pet.

694
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,831
News flash! No one likes
the teacher's pet.

695
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,628
You know I've been waiting
for this day for a long time.

696
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,234
It's gonna get messy,
Ferdinand.

697
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,318
This is it.

698
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,072
Come on! Bring it on!

699
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,232
Let's go! Let's go out there
and give it 110%.

700
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,431
Hey, that better not be
my bucket, Guap.

701
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,198
It's definitely your bucket.

702
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,998
Ugh, gross.

703
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,718
Hey, hey, buddy.
You feeling good?

704
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,840
No. Not really.

705
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,110
Okay. Cool.
Try to have some fun with it.

706
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,560
I'll be sitting
in the front row.

707
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,198
I call it the splash zone.

708
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,118
I'll see ya later.

709
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,433
Impress me.

710
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,079
Release the bulls!

711
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,496
- Nope. Nope. No, no, no.
- Get outta the way!

712
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,816
I'm gonna sit this one out.
Get out there!

713
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,336
Let's go! Get in there.
No, I'll pass, thanks.

714
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,736
Let's go. Move!
You guys go ahead.

715
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,318
Move!

716
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,472
For the glory of Scotland!

717
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,355
Whoo-hoo!
Smash them in the head!

718
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,840
Whoa!

719
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Watch out.

720
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,600
Hey.

721
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,670
Up high. Down low. Too slow.

722
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,995
Outta my way, Bones!

723
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,516
Ha! That didn't hurt.

724
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,631
Ferdinand,
El Primero is watching.

725
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,755
You gotta hit something.

726
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,115
Nope. Actually, I'm gonna pass
on the violence.

727
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,510
Well, if you don't hit them,
they're going to hit you.

728
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,511
Gangway!
Whoa!

729
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,920
You finally ready to fight?
Come on!

730
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,834
Guapo with the hit.

731
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,638
Take that, Valiente.

732
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,709
You think you got
what it takes, Guapo?

733
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,358
Then show that to El Primero.

734
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,830
Oh, I will. I'll show him who
the real champ is around here.

735
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,473
Keep it together, Guapo.

736
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,429
Bull down!

737
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,435
Aah!

738
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,274
Hey! Get off me!

739
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Enough.

740
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,197
The bullfight is a battle
of wits and strength.

741
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,271
These bulls have nothing.

742
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,631
Espere, señor.
Give the bulls another chance.

743
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,950
My final fight is in two days.

744
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,076
If I do not find the best bull

745
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,037
for the best bullfighter
by then...

746
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,392
no bullfighter will ever
use your ranch again.

747
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,519
What did you think you were
doing back there, you numpty?

748
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,113
Are you trying
to make us look bad?

749
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,553
Because you made us look bad.

750
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,790
You made us look real bad.

751
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,349
I was just trying
to help Guapo.

752
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,670
Help? There's no helping.

753
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,911
Oh, you are the worst
fighting bull

754
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,558
I have ever partially seen.

755
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,951
Well, that's because he isn't
a real fighter.

756
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,430
Oh, little Ferdinand
had a growth spurt.

757
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,637
But he's still the same scared
little coward he always was.

758
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,360
Why does not wanting to fight
mean I'm scared?

759
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,034
Yeah. That's ridonculous.
Look at him.

760
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,037
My boy is a killing machine.
Right, Ferd?

761
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,276
No, I'm not a killing machine.

762
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,918
I've been trying
to tell you, Lupe.

763
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,519
You didn't destroy a village?

764
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,477
And I didn't eat a baby.

765
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,953
Not even a nibble?

766
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,475
Eh...
Are you trying to tell me

767
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,313
that you don't want to fight
for glory in the ring?

768
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,799
I'm not a fighter.

769
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,076
I don't understand that
at all.

770
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,629
Yeah, me either.
What else is there?

771
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,000
Whoo!

772
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,718
Whoo-hoo!

773
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,349
Look who got picked
by El Primero.

774
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,913
Who's the bull now?

775
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,470
Uh-huh. Guapo going to
the big show, that's right.

776
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,640
What in the blazes?

777
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,598
I have no idea
what happened back there.

778
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,715
No clue.

779
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,314
But it must have been epic!

780
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,198
What in the deuce
is happening?

781
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,474
Somebody narrate.

782
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,791
I'm gonna be famous! Whoo!

783
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,319
Oh, no!

784
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,438
So long, suckers!

785
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,398
Wait a second.
Where are they taking him?

786
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,720
Uh...

787
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,072
They're taking Guap
to the chop house.

788
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,828
You.

789
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,390
You messed with his head.
This is on you.

790
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,993
Oh, please.

791
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,071
Guapo was never going
to make it to the ring.

792
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,200
We all knew that.

793
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,920
And so, because of that,
he deserves to go there?

794
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,270
Listen to me, Flower Bull.

795
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,668
Things have changed
around here

796
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,760
since you ran away.

797
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,599
Now, you're either a fighter
or you're meat.

798
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,433
Later, meat.

799
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,674
Bones?
Ferdinand!

800
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,037
I'm not...
You okay?

801
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,358
Why wouldn't I be okay?

802
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,916
I just have, uh... allergies.

803
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,548
Oh, yeah, sure.

804
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,278
You know,
there's a lot of pollen

805
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,520
in the air this time of year.

806
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,632
That's right, a lot of pollen.

807
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,677
Makes my eyes water.

808
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,394
Hey...

809
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,155
I'm really sorry about Guapo.

810
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,311
I know you guys were friends.

811
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,034
Bulls don't have friends,
Ferd.

812
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,589
Guapo was my competition,
okay?

813
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,680
I'm fine.

814
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,997
Oh, okay.

815
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,196
I mean, how many times
did I tell him...

816
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,873
"You gotta get
outta your head, man.

817
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,951
"You gotta control
your fears," you know.

818
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,633
But he wouldn't listen.

819
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,189
Sorry.

820
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,836
It's okay to feel bad, Bones.

821
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,512
You won't tell anyone
about this, will you?

822
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,398
I won't say a word.

823
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,949
But if you ever
wanna talk about,

824
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,837
I don't know, allergies?

825
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,154
I'm around.

826
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,159
Thanks, Ferdinand.

827
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,193
You're okay.

828
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,791
Hey, Ferd, look...

829
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,079
if you don't wanna
end up like Guap...

830
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,959
you gotta get your horns
in the game, man.

831
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,839
That's the one thing
Valiente's got right.

832
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,468
I'm comin' for ya,
you bleedin' barrel!

833
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,318
Oh!

834
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,833
And the barrel wins
another round!

835
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,479
Give up, dude.

836
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,437
Hey, big guy, you're on.
Mr. Matador is watching.

837
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,354
I got this. Uh-huh.

838
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,669
I'm ready. Let's go.

839
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,353
Come on!
In. Out. In. Out.

840
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,800
Hmm!

841
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,472
Come on, Klaus.
Come on, Greta.

842
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,269
Und up! Two, three, four.
Pirouette!

843
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,918
Oh, jealous?

844
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,718
Good prancing, boys.

845
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,072
Oh, yes.
That's the one.

846
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,673
Look alive, F-Stop.

847
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,150
We got 24 hours to whip you
into shape for El Primero.

848
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,713
From now on, you're not soft.

849
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,314
You're not a flower bull.
You're a killing machine.

850
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,176
I'll finally get you
this time, barrel.

851
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,200
Say it with me.

852
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,998
I am a...

853
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,200
Bunny!

854
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,952
Bunny? No, not bunny.

855
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,513
Barrel death!

856
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,716
Stop! Angus, look out!

857
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

858
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,400
Huh?

859
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,635
Oh, no!

860
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,793
Come on, little guy!
Come on! Come back!

861
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,797
Don't go into the light!

862
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,238
Live, bunny, live!

863
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,072
Ha!

864
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,197
Sorry I almost killed you. Ow.

865
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,914
You're not helping
your reputation here, pal,

866
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,991
apologizing
to the bunny rabbit.

867
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,752
But taking out another bull...

868
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,115
that's an energy we can use!

869
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,200
Who did that?

870
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,511
Who pushed me?

871
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,032
Ooh!
It was you, wasn't it?

872
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,071
Actually, Angus, it was me.

873
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,469
Oh, I'm doomed, I'm doomed,
I'm doomed!

874
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,710
Primero picks a bull
tomorrow...

875
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,950
and I'm talking
to a bloomin' tractor.

876
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,758
That's just your nerves
talking, Angus.

877
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,880
You're gonna be fine.

878
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,474
No, I'm not.

879
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,074
First Guapo, now me. I'm next!

880
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,678
Can I tell you
my terrible secret? Hmm?

881
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,198
Can I whisper it in your ear?

882
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,635
Sure.

883
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,472
I cannot see very well. Shh!

884
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,795
Once they find out,
it's all over for Angus.

885
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,554
I'm a dead bull walking. Done!

886
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,711
Finito! Kaput!
Angus, wait. Whoa!

887
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,035
Oh.

888
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,311
What a surprise. I can see.

889
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,793
Look, a rock! Another rock!

890
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,309
And the world's
most ugliest dog.

891
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Huh?

892
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,232
And there it is.

893
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,992
My nemesis!

894
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,550
I'm coming for you,
ya wee wooden devil!

895
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,917
Ha-hah!

896
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,674
I did it!

897
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,310
I finally beat you!
Beat you, beat you, beat you!

898
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,232
Oh, look at that.

899
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,908
That's spectacular.

900
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,832
You've given me
a fighting chance, Ferdinand.

901
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,917
Why would you do such a thing?

902
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,351
If we don't look out
for each other, who will?

903
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,909
Besides, it wasn't
that big of a deal.

904
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,638
It was for me.

905
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,958
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry to kill the mood.

906
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,076
Can I steal you for a second?

907
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,634
I got tears, honestly.

908
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,075
Really did a good thing
out there, pal.

909
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,559
Yeah, come here.

910
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,473
Somethin' I wanna tell ya.

911
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,755
Stop helping the competition!
Ow!

912
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,230
What, are you gonna give
Valiente a hoof massage now?

913
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,277
Lupe, I'm not some...
I get it.

914
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,510
You don't like
the bullfighting.

915
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,989
It's because you're hung up
on the blood

916
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,433
and the guts
and the maiming...

917
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,716
and the gore
and the senseless violence.

918
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,840
Do you have a point?

919
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,029
My point is, it's about more
than just smashing heads.

920
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,829
It's about rhythm
and footwork and grace.

921
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,911
Don't just think of it
as a fight.

922
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,674
Think of it like a dance.

923
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,432
A bull dancing?

924
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,556
Is this some kind
of hilarious joke

925
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,959
designed to make me laugh?

926
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,120
You see, horses,

927
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,040
we have the beautifulest legs
for the dancing.

928
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,912
Bulls have short,
stubby legs.

929
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,269
Yeah. Look at me.

930
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,032
Moo, moo, moo.

931
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,957
Go eat a schnitzel,
you pasty-faced glue stick!

932
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,348
It's okay, Lupe,
they're right.

933
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,988
I mean, how could
a big, clumsy bull

934
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,638
ever do something like this?

935
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,631
Whoo! Check out my boy
cuttin' a rug.

936
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,597
Yeah!
That was good.

937
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,557
You call that dancing? Ha!

938
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,076
Nein! This is dancing.

939
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,629
Three against one
is hardly fair.

940
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,552
Lupe, get my pipes!

941
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,554
Well, put that in your kilts
and smoke it!

942
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,635
Don't celebrate yet,
you rump roast!

943
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,119
Try this!

944
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,636
Ooh, I hate those horses!

945
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,074
It's show time.

946
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,108
I'm going in!

947
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,993
All hooks to the coatrack

948
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,036
Why, why would I hold back?

949
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,434
Click-tack like a Kodak

950
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,317
Just try and stop me
Try and stop me, whoo

951
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,153
Long time to the climax

952
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,231
Fine dime, girl
Let me shine that

953
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,594
Oh, no with the hold back

954
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,716
Just try and stop me
Try and stop me, whoo

955
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,238
I'm on a new trip

956
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,752
A rocket to the moon ship

957
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,675
Watch me

958
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,148
Whoa!
Yeah!

959
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,039
Watch me, watch me

960
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,560
Watch me

961
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,756
A rocket to the moon ship

962
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,155
Hey, watch where
you're stepping, dummkopf.

963
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,480
Who are you calling dummkopf?

964
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,709
You have four left hooves.

965
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,828
Watch me

966
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,239
Yeah!

967
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,153
I've fallen
and I can't giddyup.

968
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,435
We did it, lads!

969
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,755
Oh, yes!
Yeah!

970
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,776
Nice one! Nice one!

971
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,358
That's right,
'cause we're bulls.

972
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,870
Go on, horses, prance.
'Cause you can't dance.

973
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,752
Auf Wiedersehen.

974
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,674
Aw. Why didn't we
do that sooner?

975
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,798
Felt good to put those
show ponies in their place.

976
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,236
I haven't laughed like that
since ever.

977
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,396
Maquina, are you smiling?

978
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,879
That's what it is!

979
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,469
A smile!

980
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,393
Laugh your way right into
the chop house.

981
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,913
That's where you're headed.

982
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,511
No, no! Not if we
get outta here, guys.

983
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,874
There are places out there

984
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,439
where you don't
get pushed around...

985
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,750
or shipped to a chop house
for being yourself.

986
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,350
If it's so great out there,

987
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,317
why did they send you back here?

988
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,074
Yeah, Ferd, why did they
send you back here?

989
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,071
Well, because...
Because you're a bull.

990
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,913
You think you're different,
but you're not.

991
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,993
Our only way out is to beat
the matador in the ring.

992
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,792
And that's what I'm gonna do.

993
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,677
But by all means, ballerinas,
keep dancing.

994
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,991
Tomorrow, I'll be
on the winner's truck.

995
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,275
Don't listen to him, guys.

996
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,000
He's right. We're bulls.

997
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,071
This is the only place for us.

998
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,549
Sorry, Ferd.
I gotta get back to training.

999
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,119
You should, too.

1000
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,116
- Guys!
- Ferd, pal...

1001
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,510
I think they got a point.
We're running outta time.

1002
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,830
They wanna stay, I get it.

1003
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,231
But I'm leaving here tonight.
Let's bust outta here, Lupe.

1004
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,590
And go where?

1005
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,637
This is it, Ferd.

1006
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,360
It's a dog-eat-dog,
bull-fight-bull,

1007
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,351
everybody-hate-goat world.

1008
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,556
It doesn't have
to be that way.

1009
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,834
I'll take you to my home.

1010
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,393
It's different there.

1011
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,028
And Nina...
Nina will love you.

1012
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,351
Who's this Nina?

1013
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,273
And what's love?

1014
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,555
So you'll come?

1015
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,315
Do you really think...

1016
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,675
I'm just gonna throw away
my three-day dream

1017
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,593
of training a champion bull?
Oh.

1018
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,511
Of course I am!
It was a stupid dream!

1019
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,953
I have a new dream.

1020
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,793
Busting out of this stink hole
with my best friend!

1021
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,111
Just one problem,
this joint is locked up tight.

1022
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,550
No one gets outta this place.

1023
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,637
Actually, that's not true.

1024
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,116
A bull wanting to escape
Casa del Toro?

1025
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,077
Hah, good luck with that,
amigo.

1026
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,708
Look, I could
really use your help.

1027
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,234
Do you know a way outta here?

1028
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,198
Yeah. We might know a way.

1029
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,316
But what's in it for us?

1030
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,713
Ooh.

1031
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,279
Really?

1032
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,440
Excuse me,

1033
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,670
you're re-gifting my gift
to the gerbils?

1034
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,637
First of all, hedgehogs.

1035
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,678
And you will never,
ever buy us

1036
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,557
with a cheap piece of junk.

1037
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,077
Ooh!

1038
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,230
No, don't do it! Resist!

1039
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,879
I can't help it!

1040
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,394
Mmm! It gives me the happies.

1041
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,915
Okay, yeah.
Way to play hardball, Cuatro.

1042
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,600
That's the plan?

1043
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,438
You want me to go
through the house?

1044
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,471
If we get caught
inside that house,

1045
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,600
we're toast.

1046
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,954
Oh, I love toast.

1047
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,560
You wanna get out of here,
don't you?

1048
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,154
Okay. Let's do it.

1049
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,999
All right, just do
exactly what we do.

1050
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,275
Balls.

1051
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,758
Yeah, maybe don't do
exactly as we do.

1052
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,593
Now, you go through there.

1053
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,676
Me? Through there?

1054
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,999
Uh, have you seen these hips?

1055
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,513
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

1056
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,716
I can't! I can't!

1057
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,191
I'm stuck! Wait!

1058
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,193
Get your hoof...
Squeeze in!

1059
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,679
...out of my mouth.

1060
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,592
It's not working.
It's not working.

1061
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,476
Okay, all right,
we gotta do something, guys.

1062
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,756
One, two, three, four

1063
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,717
Uno, do', tres, cuatro

1064
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,553
Whoa, look at
the cute squirrels.

1065
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,720
What?

1066
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,719
We are hedgehogs!

1067
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,680
Okay, it's a straight shot

1068
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,200
through the kitchen
to the front door.

1069
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,198
And then, you're home free.

1070
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,395
Piece of cake.

1071
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,073
I love cake.

1072
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,230
He's coming down,
he's coming down!

1073
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,594
Run!

1074
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,592
Can you just try to be
a little more quiet?

1075
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,873
Shh.

1076
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,073
Yikes on a stick.

1077
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,437
What are you doing
with 53 swords?

1078
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,912
Is that...?

1079
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,279
My dad.

1080
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,712
Oh, Ferd.

1081
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,515
He was the bravest bull
I knew.

1082
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,634
He really believed
he could beat the matador.

1083
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,472
All of them did.

1084
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,396
The bull never wins.

1085
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,071
Come on, Ferd.
Let's get you home.

1086
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,988
The door to freedom.

1087
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,832
Ferd, what are you doing?

1088
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,431
Come on, we gotta go now!

1089
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,114
No. I can't leave.

1090
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:15,278
What? Ferd,
this is your only chance!

1091
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,512
The guys back there
still think they can win.

1092
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,511
Just like my dad did.

1093
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,108
And I can't let them
end up on that wall.

1094
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,238
Guys? Everybody up, come on!

1095
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,594
We have to go now!

1096
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,839
Have you lost
your bloody mind?

1097
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,513
We have to get
outta here tonight!

1098
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,875
El Primero's selecting a bull
in the morning.

1099
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,952
We're not going anywhere.
I'm gonna take his butt down.

1100
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,031
No! You don't
wanna get selected.

1101
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,553
Trust me,
it's a death sentence.

1102
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,075
- Rubbish! Not if you win.
- That's just it.

1103
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,276
No bull wins. Ever.

1104
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,879
I was in Moreno's house,
I saw it.

1105
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,268
Jings! Crivens!
And help ma boab!

1106
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,476
And there's a lot more
where that came from.

1107
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,560
A lot more.

1108
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,153
There's really no way to win?

1109
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,675
You get to fight
in a big fancy arena...

1110
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,513
but I'm telling you,
it's just another chop house.

1111
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,391
Why would I believe
a coward...

1112
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,640
who thinks the only way out
is through the back door?

1113
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,314
Are you crazy?
Did you not hear what I said?

1114
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,233
Bulls fight or they go down.
That's how the world works.

1115
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,311
There's nothing left
for you here, Valiente.

1116
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,674
Come with us.
No!

1117
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,239
What are you so afraid of?

1118
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,630
I'm not afraid of anything!

1119
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,914
Come on, fight me.

1120
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,957
I'm not gonna fight you,
Valiente.

1121
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,553
Coward!

1122
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,720
Fight!

1123
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,719
Valiente, stop!

1124
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,880
You're soft.

1125
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,313
Like your father.

1126
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,750
And the soft ones
always go down!

1127
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,109
Stop!

1128
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,033
What's going on?

1129
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,233
That one is the best bull.

1130
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,795
I'll fight him
in Madrid tomorrow.

1131
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,873
Oh, this is bad.

1132
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,792
You got selected
by El Primero.

1133
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,000
Do you know what this means?

1134
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,268
A sword through his melon!

1135
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,038
Horns on the wall.

1136
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,793
Exactly, Maquina.

1137
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,599
We gotta get you
outta here now!

1138
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,033
Oh, no. I know that look.
No, no, don't say it.

1139
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,275
I'm not leaving.

1140
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,072
Oh! You're killing me!

1141
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,276
Not unless everyone
is coming with me.

1142
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,360
Yes!

1143
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,078
Sign me up!
I'm in!

1144
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,872
Okay, you happy now?

1145
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,393
I said everyone.

1146
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,669
Klaus, Greta...

1147
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,353
I'm sorry
for the things I said

1148
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,600
about your terrible dancing.

1149
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,790
Nein. Nein. Hans...

1150
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,589
I am the horse that is full
of the shame and the regret.

1151
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,318
I cannot stay mad at you.

1152
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,231
Kommen Sie,
you sons of stallions.

1153
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,231
Let's Häagen Dazs it out.

1154
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,353
What is the meaning of this?

1155
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,078
How did you get in here,
stinky bull?

1156
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,078
Stinky hedgehogs.

1157
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,988
I am blinded!

1158
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,840
Adiós.

1159
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,352
Greta, Klaus,
where are you?

1160
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,033
Hedge for one...

1161
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,511
And hog for all!

1162
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,912
You messed
with the wrong hogs.

1163
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,719
Okay. Let's go!

1164
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,598
Hurry! Keep it moving!

1165
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,794
Get to work, Ferd.

1166
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,276
This is an outrage!
Open the door!

1167
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,874
Valiente?

1168
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,840
Valiente?

1169
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,598
What are you doing here?

1170
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,000
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm getting you outta here.

1171
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,360
Come on!
We don't have a lot of time.

1172
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,518
Don't you get it? Look at me!
I'm already done.

1173
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,755
Oh, sure.
That makes total sense.

1174
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,070
You're either a fighter
or you're meat, right?

1175
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,753
That's right.

1176
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,353
It doesn't
have to be that way.

1177
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,993
You're more than just
a set of horns.

1178
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,229
Come with us.

1179
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,793
So I can...

1180
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,633
sniff flowers and pal around
with goats?

1181
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,358
No, that's my thing.

1182
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,715
You can live
your own life now.

1183
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,518
But not if you give up.

1184
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,790
Oh, Mama!

1185
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,074
It's Guapo!

1186
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,673
Valiente, come on!

1187
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,068
Go away.

1188
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,038
Wow.
I thought you were a fighter.

1189
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,918
I guess I was wrong.

1190
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,435
Where are they?

1191
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,511
Open the door!
Get back in there.

1192
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,196
Guapo!

1193
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,714
Guapo!

1194
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,559
Guap... Whoa!

1195
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,911
Oh, Ferdinand!

1196
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,719
I did not get picked
by El Primero!

1197
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,474
I know. And that's
a good thing, trust me.

1198
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,709
I'm gonna get you down.

1199
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,632
Thank holy goodness.

1200
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,640
I didn't think
I was going to make it.

1201
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,120
Oh, no.

1202
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:41,680
Ahhh! Help me!

1203
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,159
Hang on!

1204
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,069
Ferdinand!

1205
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,554
Hold on, Guapo!

1206
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,896
Don't let go! Don't let me go!

1207
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,911
Hang on!
Don't let me go!

1208
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,600
Val?

1209
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,671
Thought you could use
an extra horn.

1210
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,875
Whoa!

1211
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,395
What? What's the problem?

1212
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,438
Nothing! You look great. Oh!

1213
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,158
So, we getting
outta here or what?

1214
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,310
Over here, guys!
Help!

1215
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,309
That wasn't so bad.

1216
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,198
Yeah, quite relaxing.

1217
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,679
Watch out!

1218
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,068
What are you guys doing?

1219
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,468
We're trying to help you!

1220
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,790
Well, you're doing
a terrible job!

1221
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,674
Anyone got an ice pick?

1222
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,429
Mama!

1223
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,915
Here they come!

1224
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,878
Holy cow!
Hey, guys.

1225
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,712
Guapo lives!

1226
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,518
Okay. I deserve that.

1227
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,999
Everybody in!

1228
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,616
You better know
how to drive this thing.

1229
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,358
We're about to find out.

1230
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,557
Okay, guys. Think thin!

1231
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,474
We got company! Hit it!

1232
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,469
Yeah!

1233
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,671
Bull overboard!

1234
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:54,840
Go!

1235
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,954
Wait for me! Wait for me!

1236
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,559
Are you seeing this, too?

1237
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:21,349
If you lose my bull,
I'll fight you in the ring.

1238
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,160
Bunny!

1239
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,073
Your turn.

1240
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,554
Go!

1241
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,312
Come on, Angus. You can do it!

1242
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,436
I'm a bull, not a doctor.

1243
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,269
They're getting closer.
Speed up!

1244
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,237
I'm pressing as hard as I can!

1245
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,992
Which way?
Hard right.

1246
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,838
I don't feel so good.

1247
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,513
Yeah.
Been there, buddy.

1248
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,395
I said right!

1249
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,834
I thought you meant my right.

1250
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,468
We have the same right!

1251
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,679
A convertible!

1252
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,034
Fancy!

1253
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,635
Get over there.

1254
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,509
My hand!

1255
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,909
- Take the wheel.
- Who? Me?

1256
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,840
Aah!

1257
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,873
I got ya, hedgehog.

1258
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,839
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1259
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,751
Nothing can stop us now!

1260
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,755
What part of Scotland
is this anyway?

1261
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,989
This is lovely.

1262
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,559
Come on. Move it, people.

1263
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,910
I'm starving.

1264
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,354
Come on!

1265
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,240
Let's go!

1266
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,839
What now, Ferd?

1267
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,680
That's it.

1268
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,273
We gotta get to the train.

1269
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,475
Guys, we gotta hoof it.

1270
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,435
Whoo!

1271
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,999
Do what I do.

1272
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,080
Ha-ha!

1273
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,829
Yeah, right.

1274
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,310
Sorry. Oop, my bad!

1275
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,119
I'm free to do what I want

1276
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,997
And have a good time

1277
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,789
Now somebody, anybody,
everybody, say

1278
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,075
I'm free to do what I want

1279
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,912
And have a good time

1280
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,675
Now somebody, anybody,
everybody, say

1281
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,751
Miami
We were born to be free

1282
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,751
UK
We were born to be free

1283
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,149
Spain
Let's escape and feel free

1284
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,475
Oh! Hello, handsome.

1285
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,993
Oh, they're coming!

1286
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,110
Bahamas
We were born to be free

1287
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,509
Cuba
Can't wait to live free

1288
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,880
Yeah

1289
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,713
I'm free to do what I want

1290
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,711
And have a good time

1291
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,233
Watch it, Ferdinand.

1292
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,273
Oh, yeah!

1293
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,438
Smile, Dad.

1294
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,639
Matador!

1295
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,155
Watch out!

1296
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:49,829
I got this.

1297
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:50,920
Cool!

1298
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,080
That's it.

1299
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,992
The train!
Are you blind, laddie?

1300
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,798
That's a bloomin' bus.

1301
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,678
That's it. Track eight.

1302
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,996
Come on, follow us! Hurry!

1303
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,994
Move it, Guapo.

1304
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,879
I don't wanna die
looking at your butt!

1305
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,037
There they are! Get them!

1306
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,150
Come on. Give me a boost.

1307
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,112
Hurry! It's leaving!

1308
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,793
Go, go, go!

1309
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,273
Come on, guys!

1310
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,359
We can do this, bulls.

1311
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,473
Go, go!

1312
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,752
Move it or lose it!

1313
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,638
I'll keep pushing.
You guys jump on!

1314
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,352
Push, bulls. Push!

1315
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,720
Come on, guys.

1316
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:16,829
They're coming fast!

1317
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,194
Okay, hop on!

1318
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,554
They want you. You go first.

1319
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,079
Just go!

1320
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:25,879
Whoo!
Yeah!

1321
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,309
Ferd!

1322
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,016
Chaos in Madrid today...

1323
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,519
as a group of runaway bulls

1324
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,960
stampeded through
the city streets.

1325
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,630
the fiercest of the bulls
was handpicked...

1326
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,678
to face El Primero
in his final fight.

1327
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,600
Nina!

1328
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:07,835
Ferd.

1329
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,479
Listen, okay.

1330
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,353
You are the bravest bull
I know.

1331
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,831
You can do this.

1332
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,639
But you're gonna
have to fight.

1333
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,476
Just this one time, Ferd.

1334
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,559
Please?

1335
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,993
El Primero!

1336
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:32,989
Fight.

1337
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,629
Fight!

1338
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,355
Olé!

1339
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:41,880
What?

1340
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,869
Just great!

1341
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,318
I can't see.

1342
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,794
There, Nina!

1343
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,279
Let him live!

1344
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,752
Spare the bull!

1345
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:00,953
Let him go!

1346
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,237
Save the bull!
Let him go!

1347
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:15,635
Ferdinand!

1348
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,952
Ferdinand!

1349
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,360
Ferdinand!

1350
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,514
I thought I'd never
see you again.

1351
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:15,760
Whoa.

1352
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,318
Mmm!

1353
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,200
Huh?

1354
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,111
Flower bull did it.

1355
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,150
Holy moly! You've multiplied.

1356
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,717
Hey, Pac-Man!
I missed you, dawg.

1357
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,952
Well, I didn't miss you.
Not even a little bit.

1358
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,390
The tail don't lie, brother.

1359
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,837
I have got to get that fixed.

1360
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:24,390
Goat! Goat! Can't breathe.

1361
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,039
Jeez Louise!

1362
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:31,875
Haven't you brutes ever
heard of "ladies first"?

1363
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:35,191
Aw! You're adorable.

1364
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,952
Is this love?

1365
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,111
I love love.

1366
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,199
Always out of place

1367
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:07,113
I knew I needed
something new for me

1368
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:12,035
I never knew just what
that was, yeah

1369
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,429
Finding something safe
was just like

1370
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,431
Trying to catch
a bird in flight

1371
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:19,717
I knew that I would
never touch

1372
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:25,470
But now I won't let go

1373
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:29,075
'Cause I'm happy to call
this

1374
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,435
Home
No more running

1375
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:33,799
I'm good knowing

1376
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:38,349

Shedding all that insecurity

1385
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:01,072
I kind of found a new me

1386
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:05,551
I'm okay with how that feels
yeah

1387
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,598
Being me was hard enough

1388
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:10,433
So being someone else
was too much

1389
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:14,308
All I want is something real

1390
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:19,076
Now I won't let go

1391

Home is when you're right
where you should be

1406
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,633
Find where you're happy

'Cause I'm happy to call

01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:13,656
This was fun. You know what,

1409
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:15,096
the only thing that would
make this better...

1410
