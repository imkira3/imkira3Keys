1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,559
I meant to get a haircut.

3
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,270
I got a present for ya, Casey.

4
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,430
<i>Casey, sweetie,</i>

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,840
<i>you take your daddy's
present now.</i>

6
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,076
<i>I got a picture of you, too.</i>

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,239
Maria!

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,510
No! No, no! No!

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,239
<i>Happy birthday, darlin'.</i>

10
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Thank you.

11
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,275
<i>Obviously, you've seen</i>

12
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,536
<i>Mankiewicz's House of Strangers.</i>

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,016
It's one of my
all-time favorite movies.

14
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,856
That's exactly
what your script reminded me of.

15
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
The power struggle,

16
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,359
- the fight for relevance.
- Yeah.

17
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,376
And you're gonna think
this sounds a little crazy,

18
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,550
but in some ways,
it's <i>King Lear.</i>

19
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,840
It's <i>King Lear.</i>
Yeah, exactly.

20
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,479
See, I knew you'd understand

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,616
what I'm trying to do
with this film.

22
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Right.

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,590
David, I don't know
what to say exactly,

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,512
except this is the role
of a lifetime

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,910
and I'd really love
to be a part of this.

26
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,896
Cool, man. I'll just give you
a shout in a couple of days.

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,991
If you're worried
about the Boston accent,

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,309
I can do the Boston accent.

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,680
I've been working on it
all week.

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
I'm not worried, Nick.

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,558
Okay, well, if you have
any other questions

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,318
or you just wanna talk,
give me a call.

33
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,918
Or if you'd like me to,
to read...

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,520
You don't need to read for me.

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,675
Of course not.

36
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,776
And obviously, I'm not going to.

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,835
Obviously.

38
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,656
Bull bet a part of you would
love to hear me read, right?

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
I mean, why wouldn't you?

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,976
If I were you,
I'd want to hear it.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,096
Seriously,
I don't want you to read.

42
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Okay.

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,992
Anyway, this is me,
so I'm gonna...

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,515
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna read.

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,477
"Ifs a foregone conclusion,
Jimmy.

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,270
"It takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain

47
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,998
"to send a message to the body.

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,879
"So, by the time your bullets
hit me, my cerebral cortex

49
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,216

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,435

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,277
“And before your asshole

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,997
"And if that's the last thing I accomplish

56
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,320
"on this beautiful green Earth,

57
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,230
"well, then, I say,
what a way to fucking go."

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,319
Holy shit.

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,953
I can do another if you want.

60
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,074
Damn, man!

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,830
That was good, right?
Felt good.

62
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,315
Mankiewicz?
Incredible pull.

63
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,357
I know.
It just popped into my head.

64
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,397
Well, good. I'm happy for you.

65
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,359
Because, honestly, man,
you really need this.

66
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,392
What? What is that
supposed to mean?

67
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,035
You get it.
This could be a game changer.

68
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,136
I don't need a game changer.
If it happens, it happens.

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,936
If it doesn't, <i>I'll</i> just keep
working. That's what I do.

70
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,873
I'm just saying, you could be
a little more strategic.

71
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,553
Make more movie star choices.

72
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,393
It's like Miles Davis told me...

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,596
"Sometimes, it's the notes
you don't play."

74
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,353
Miles Davis was a heroin addict.

75
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,896
I mean, I love him,
he was a maestro,

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
but I'm happy»

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,376
I'm healthy when I'm working.
I'm an actor.

78
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,198
No, you're a fucking movie star!

79
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,520
And don't you ever forget that!

80
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,278
Okay, I don't need this.
I don't need this.

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,237
Get out of my car.
Nicky, get out of my car.

82
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,833
I don't need this.

83
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,118
I need this.

84
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,272
This could be a game changer.

85
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,376
So, you're not happy
with how your career is going

86
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,835
because you seem to be
working all the time.

87
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,550
Well, I never viewed it
as a career, only as work.

88
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,696
And what's wrong with that?

89
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,758
I mean, in any other job,
hard work is something to behold,

90
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,880
but with film performance,

91
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,136
"You're making
too many movies, Nick."

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,440
"You're working too hard, Nick."

93
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,776
"Have the audience
miss you more, Nick."

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,757
I mean, hello, it's my job.

95
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
I pay my bills.

96
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,831
I feed my family.
You're annoying.

97
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,274
My Slush!

98
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Yeah.

99
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,718
So, what's the worry here, Nick?

100
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,595
You've lost some of your ability,
your talent as an actor?

101
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
No.

102
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,477
No, it's just that
I really want this.

103
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,914
This is the role of a lifetime.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,354
It's a great part.

105
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,717
Well, how do you think
your relationship with your work

106
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,189
affects your relationship
with your daughter?

107
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,317
Let's bring Addy into this,
shall we?

108
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,436
What?
Oh, you don't have to do that.

109
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,715
You guys can keep talking.

110
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,035
Well, I'll just finish with,

111
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,616
a role like this
doesn't come along every day.

112
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,680
And now, I'm gonna zip it.

113
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,760
- I zipped it good.
- Addy.

114
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,229
How do you think
your dad's anxiety

115
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,833
over his career
has affected you?

116
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,912
Well, his career is pretty much
the only thing we talk about.

117
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,633
That or he makes me watch
old movies,

118
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,199
and then discuss them.

119
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,874
Which is really just him
lecturing me for two hours.

120
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,554
Ifs a conversation.
It's more of a conversation.

121
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,519
He made me watch
this bizarre old movie.

122
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,360
What was it called?
The Island of Dr. Calamari?

123
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,034
<i>- The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>
- And did you like it, Addy'?

124
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,636
It's one of my favorite films.
Have you seen it?

125
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,869
No, I have not.

126
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,349
It's about this insane old doctor

127
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,632
who has a sleepwalker
completely under his spell.

128
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,991
This crazy old loon.

129
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,835
Can you imagine
how horrifying that would be?

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,256
To be completely
under someone's spell?

131
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
And you liked it, right?

132
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,795
I mean, you like the painted
sets, and the makeup...

133
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,995
No, I did not.

134
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,315
Sounds to me like

135
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,391
maybe she didn't want to see
the movie.

136
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,995
Did you think about that, Nick?
About what she wants?

137
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,117
Cheryl, come on.
Is that a real question?

138
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,759
What do you think
he's gonna say?

139
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,109
She has an amazing visual
sensibility. Always has.

140
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,856
We're very close,
and within that closeness,

141
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,314
I was able to ascertain...

142
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, Mom.

143
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,716
Bye, Addy. I love you.

144
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,479
Oh, no, what happened?

145
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,551
Oh, she's mad at me
because we watched

146
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,950
<i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i>
together and she hated it,

147
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,839
which I find odd,
given how mature her taste normally is.

148
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,672
Wait, you're surprised
your teenage daughter

149
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,879
didn't wanna watch an insane
100-year-old German film with you?

150
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,758
- Yes.
- Oh, my God. Okay.

151
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,955
Well, it's not just that.

152
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,633
You know, she's never read
Mary Shelley,

153
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,916
or Jane Austen, or even Twain.

154
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,629
What a little philistine.
Should we disown her?

155
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,111
She thought Humphrey Bogart
was a porn star.

156
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,509
Yeah...

157
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,392
- What, really?
- Yeah.

158
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,679
That's disappointing.

159
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,755
Unless there is a pom star
called Humphrey Bogart.

160
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,116
That would work, wouldn't it?
Humphrey. Hump.

161
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,830
No?

162
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,194
Look, you're just...

163
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,552
You're at a tricky stage
right now with her, okay?

164
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,936
And if you don't learn
to connect,

165
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,080
ifs gonna stay broken for...

166
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,758
What the fuck
are you smiling at?

167
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,736
- Why are you smiling?
- I'm not.

168
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
- You are.
- Okay.

169
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,176
Olivia, I'm up
for a very exciting movie.

170
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,429
And I think it's gonna happen.

171
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,736
Oh, my God.
Look, will you do me a favor?

172
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Yes.

173
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,016
Turn up for her birthday party.

174
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,599
- Of course.
- Of course.

175
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,909
Gosh!

176
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,310
Hey, Fink, let's meet up.
I have some questions.

177
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,113
I don't know.
I just really want this.

178
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,874
I mean, this is the role of
a lifetime, and as my agent...

179
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,351
Nick, I've got
a good feeling, okay?

180
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,078
- Okay.
- Now, come on.

181
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,037
I know how tense you get.

182
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,396
This is going to help you relax.

183
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Fuck!

184
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,471
Oh, my!
Fuck, I love this so much.

185
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,636
Is this supposed to hurt
this much? Fuck!

186
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,279
It is. The more pain, the better.

187
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Fuckin'...

188
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,270
- Why?
- It's good for circulation.

189
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,036
So, Nick, we got another offer.

190
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,160
Just came in this morning.

191
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,873
Excellent. What's it about?

192
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,077
It's about a million bucks.

193
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,278
What is it?

194
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,474
A birthday party, Fink?

195
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,278
Hat are you even talking about?

196
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,760
You go, and I don't know,

197
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,160
tell some stories,
make 'em laugh.

198
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,271
Make 'em laugh?
Like a circus clown?

199
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,759
A trained seal?

200
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,474
Nick, I got a call from your
business manager, Kenny.

201
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,696
You've been living
at the Sunset Tower for over a year.

202
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,030
And so?
They love having me there.

203
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,236
You owe them $600,000.

204
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,438
They sent the bills to Kenny.

205
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
I'll take care of it.

206
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,160
Kenny says you still have
substantial debts.

207
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,869
And now, the divorce,
and your spending habits

208
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,071
- and, and, and...
- Okay, I'm gonna deal

209
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,719
with all that, Fink.

210
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,274
You know I will.

211
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,759
But I'm gonna get this next role

212
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,432
and when I do,
all of that changes.

213
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,269
Then, I'm back.

214
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,558
And, by the way,
not that I went anywhere.

215
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,319
Not that you went anywhere.

216
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,840
You never shit on yourself.

217
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,753
Come on!
Never shit on yourself.

218
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,920
Fink, hold on a second.
Let me get somewhere quiet.

219
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,671
Fink, you still there?
I can hear you now.

220
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,440
- Did you talk to him?
<i>- I talked to David.</i>

221
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,471
- Oh, you're here. Great.
- Hold on.

222
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,675
Right, we're doing cake.

223
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,794
Oh, my God, you're doing...

224
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,995
I have to finish this call.

225
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,879
Oh, my God! Jesus Christ!

226
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Come on!

227
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,794
Fink, did you talk to him?

228
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
<i>Nick, can you hear me?</i>

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,719
Yes, I can hear you.
What did he say?

230
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,593
<i>He said he loves you,</i>

231
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,036
<i>but he ultimately went
in a different direction</i>

232
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
<i>for the role.</i>

233
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,034
<i>Sorry, dude.</i>

234
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,320
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

235
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,754
I hate it.

236
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,718
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

237
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,915
Thank you, Mom.

238
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,153
<i>Happy birthday, dear Addy</i>

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Thank you.

240
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,630
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

241
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,235
Thank you.

242
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,237
Blow. Make a wish.

243
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,393
- Happy birthday, Addy!
- AI| right, everybody!

244
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,315
Gather round the piano.
It's showtime, folks.

245
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,549
- What's he doing?
- What?

246
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,835
Nick?

247
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,593
Step away from the piano, Nick.

248
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,393
Hi, Lewis.

249
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,994
You're all grown up now.

250
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,079
What, are you...
What, are you 15?

251
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,435
Dad, don't talk to Lewis.

252
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
Okay.

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,832
When she was nine years old,

254
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,719
my daughter and I
took our first trip together.

255
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,436
We drove overnight,

256
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,120
across the desert,
to the Grand Canyon.

257
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,714
- You remember that, sweetheart?
- I do remember that.

258
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,191
And when the sun came up,

259
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,920
I pulled over
to the side of the road

260
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,669
as she rested her little head
on my shoulder

261
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,398
and we just watched...

262
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,279
Watched the sun come up.

263
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,680
That was the happiest moment
of my life.

264
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,355
And in that moment,

265
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,592
I composed a little tune
for her 16th birthday.

266
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,876
I've been working on it
ever since.

267
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,193
And... happy birthday,
sweetheart. Here goes.

268
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,160
<i>Watching the sun come up</i>

269
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,954
<i>Watching the sun rise</i>

270
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,112
<i>Addy</i>

271
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,955
<i>Addy</i>

272
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,952
<i>Addy</i>

273
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,516
<i>The love is in our eyes</i>

274
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,511
Oh, fucking Jesus!

275
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,195
I'm so excited to see what
you do with your life, honey.

276
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,152
And I'll support
whatever you choose.

277
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,312
Only, I wouldn't recommend
a life in the ans.

278
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,998
Especially, with how
real talent goes unappreciated

279
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,718
in this shithole town.

280
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,993
<i>Sun rising Sun rising</i>

281
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,238
I don't know, Olivia.

282
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
I don't know.

283
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,278
Do you remember
when the three of us

284
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,078
used to lie
on the living room floor

285
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,713
in the New York apartment,

286
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,474
and you and I would watch her
for hours on end?

287
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,039
Remember?

288
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,873
It was so much easier then.

289
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,195
Yeah.

290
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Listen.

291
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,956
I'm gonna say something,
and I'm not sure I should.

292
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,674
Say it.

293
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,155
Okay.

294
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
I need you.

295
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,195
You need me?

296
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,513
I need you to get
your shit together, Nick.

297
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,236
Okay?
She's not two years old anymore.

298
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,909
She is a smart girl
who needs her dad.

299
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,590
She doesn't need...

300
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,519
She doesn't need this guy.

301
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
Yeah.

302
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,829
No, no. Come on.

303
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,959
<i>- Nick.</i>
- Fink.

304
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,630
The Majorca thing...

305
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,837
<i>What? The birthday party?
So depressing.</i>

306
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,276
<i>I am honestly sorry
for even bringing it up.</i>

307
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
I'll take it.

308
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,749
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

309
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,718
It better be because...

310
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,159
when it's over, I'm done.

311
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,950
Like hot dogs on a grill.

312
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,192
I'm quitting acting.

313
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,355
So, you can call the trades,
and tell them I said

314
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,671
it was a tremendous...

315
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,234
honor...

316
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,514
to be a small part...

317
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,956
of one of the oldest
of human traditions,

318
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,396
storytelling and mythmaking.

319
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,675
<i>Fuck, man, I'm sorry.</i>

320
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,717

I said I'm quitting...

322
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,511
<i>Back to our main news story</i>

323
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,318
<i>as catalan's
presidential candidate</i>

324
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,470
<i>Charles Delgado's daughter</i>

325
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,835
<i>was kidnapped on Monday.</i>

326
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,276
<i>The police have confirmed
that they have no information</i>

327
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,509
<i>as to her whereabouts.</i>

328
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,000
<i>They have asked anyone

329
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,998
<i>What do you say
we cut the chitchat, a-hole?</i>

330
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,037
<i>You almost got me killed twice.</i>

331
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Okay.

332
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,634
I'm in position.

333
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,313
<i>All right,
as soon as I have eyes</i>

334
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,038
<i>on Baldassari,
you move in and take him.</i>

335
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Copy that.

336
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,275
Wait, wait, wait.
It's not Baldassari.

337
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,519
What the fuck is happening
right now?

338
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,320
Martin, talk to me.
Who's on the plane?

339
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,557
I don't know
if I'm losing my goddamn mind,

340
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,194
but I'm pretty sure
that's the actor Nick Cage.

341
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,119
That motherfucker from <i>Moonstruck?</i>

342
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,953
<i>Moonstruck?</i> No.
From <i>Face/Off.</i>

343
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,713
Wait, wait, wait...

344
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,189
Why the fuck is Nick Cage
on this plane?

345
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,913
You know what?
We're pulling out.

346
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,136
<i>I don't like this.
Get out of there.</i>

347
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,754
- Martin.
<i>- No, get out of there. Now.</i>

348
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,392
<i>Vivian, do you copy?
I said, do you copy?</i>

349
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
You know what?

350
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
No.

351
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
What do you mean, no?

352
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,794
No. Vivian, what are you doing?

353
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,194
Thank you.

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,037
- This is our shot.
<i>- No, get out.</i>

355
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,438
Vivian, get the fuck
out of there right...

356
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,037
Nicolas Cage! Oh, my God!
You're so fucking awesome!

357
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,952
- I love you!
- Thank you.

358
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,238
Me and my nephew, Raymond,
just watched <i>Croods 2.</i>

359
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,319
<i>Dude! Cracked us up.</i>

360
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,800
- Can I get a selfie?
- Sure.

361
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,336
- Oh, shit. Oh, my God.
- No, I like that movie, too.

362
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,616
You did so good
in that movie, man.

363
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,789
- Thank you.
- My goodness.

364
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,936
I made that movie
with Emma Stone.

365
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,256
- You did?
- She's one of my favorites.

366
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,496
- But you were the best.
- Well, thank you.

367
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
We look good.

368
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,113
Well, say hi
to your nephew for me.

369
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,759
- Okay. Yeah.
- Raymond. Okay.

370
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,797
- Thank you.
- AI| right, bye.

371
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,670
Dropped that GPS on him.

372
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,559
Are you out of your mind?
He's a fucking civilian.

373
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,869
<i>He's an actor.</i>

374
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,576
Do you remember
what went down in Lisbon?

375
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,273
Ck Lisbon, man!

376
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,439
That was kind of loud.

377
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,069
But fuck Lisbon.
That wasn't my fault.

378
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
And by the way,

379
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,634
- have you seen <i>Croods 2?</i>
- No.

380
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,239
I'm 44 years old.

381
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,958
Why the fuck
would I see <i>Croods 2?</i>

382
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,190
I'm picking you up.

383
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,474
Yeah, Fink, can you hold on?

384
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,816
Excuse me, it's Los Angeles
calling. I need to take this.

385
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,080
- Just two minutes.
- Of course.

386
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,350
Can you hold one second?
I'm getting on a boat.

387
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,919
Thank you. Yeah.

388
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,200
I mean, what do we know
about this guy anyway?

389
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,316
Is he a Spanish Dr. No?
Is he into something strange?

390
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,914
<i>Allan did some research.</i>
Hold on.

391
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,195
<i>Allan, what does this guy do?</i>

392
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,078
<i>He owns olive groves apparently.</i>

393
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,071
Also, he wrote this screenplay,

394
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,878
and he wants Nick to star in it.

395
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,474
Throw that in the fucking trash.

396
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
<i>Nick, you're fine.</i>

397
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,680
It's not like he's gonna
want you to suck his dick

398
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,875
or fuck his wife,

399
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,136
or watch you watch him
fuck his wife.

400
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,719
- I wouldn't think so.
<i>- Relax.</i>

401
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,720
<i>Have fun and give me a call
when it's done.</i>

402
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,960
You can tell me all about it.

403
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,029
Nice place.

404
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,470
Maybe I ought to get into
the olive business.

405
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,437
- Mr. Cage, I...
- Yeah, excuse me. Real quick.

406
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,216
The guy that owns this house,
what's his name?

407
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,038
- Javi.
- Yeah, Javi.

408
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,199
Is Javi going to want me to,
you know...

409
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,200
- I'm not sure I understand.
- Look, if Javi

410
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,896
wants me to suck his dick,
or fuck his wife,

411
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,296
or watch me watch him
fuck his wife,

412
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,096
that's a no-go.
You understand? It's <i>no bueno.</i>

413
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,793
- I think so.
- Okay, and if Javi...

414
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,030
I am Javi.

415
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,955
Nick Cage.

416
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,111
So, how was it?

417
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,558
It was fine, normal.
No big deal.

418
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,757
- Come on. Tell me the truth.
- Okay.

419
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,672
- He was incredible.
- Was he?

420
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,194
But also, like, super cool.

421
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,998
He was a little taller
than I had imagined

422
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,936
because you know they say
actors are pretty short.

423
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
So, was he short?

424
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,115
- No.
- No.

425
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
He was...

426
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
just right.

427
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,240
Okay, but did he say anything
about your screenplay?

428
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,256
No. He didn't bring it up,
I didn't bring it up.

429
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,271
It wasn't the right time.

430
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,839
Just think about
how would it feel

431
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,718
to say in front of everyone
at the party

432
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,634
that Nicolas Cage is starring
in a movie that you wrote.

433
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,296
I don't know, Gabriela,
maybe I am living in a fantasy world.

434
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,616
I mean, look who
we're talking about here.

435
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,835
The man is a legend!

436
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Hi.

437
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
<i>HEY-</i>

438
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Cheers.

439
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
What?

440
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,536
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
I thought that...

441
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,600
Did you say...
No, I did...

442
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,274
Oh, never mind.

443
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,696
Yeah, so along those
same lines, I was wondering...

444
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,856
and it's totally okay
if you haven't,

445
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,915
but I was just wondering

446
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,640
if you had a chance
to read my screenplay?

447
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,835
Javi!

448
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,790
Can I come or it's only for VIP?

449
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,955
Mr. Cage, this is

450
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,474
- Ms. Gabriela Lucchesi.
- Hi.

451
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,836
She runs
all of our agricultural operations.

452
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,754
And this is my cousin.
Lucas Gutierrez.

453
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,117
Mr. Cage, we obviously are
very excited to have you here.

454
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,040
What are you working on next?

455
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,316
Well, that's a tough question

456
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,516
for an actor to gel,
but it's fine.

457
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,157
'Cause I'm no longer an actor.

458
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
I've retired.

459
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,072
What?
What do you mean, retired?

460
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,880
So, what are you going
to do now?

461
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,832
Live the life of a house cal.

462
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,356
Because it's just a matter
of time

463
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,751
before the great power plant
upstairs turns off the juice

464
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,276
and we retreat
to the black pit of nothingness

465
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,794
from whence we came.

466
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,838
So, tell us
about making <i>The Rock.</i>

467
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,196
Bet you wish you were still
making movies

468
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,237
like that, huh, Mr. Cage?

469
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,760
Must have been nice
to have been a star.

470
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
And now...

471
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,718
Mr. Cage? Wake up.

472
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,314
Jesus Christ!

473
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,915
So, Mr. Gutierrez has been

474
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,479
waiting all day for you
to get up.

475
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,696
He really wants to show you

476
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,472
one of his favorite places
of all Spain.

477
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,392
It's called the cliffs
of Cap de For mentor.

478
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,790
Yeah, see, well,
I'm very jet lagged,

479
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,679
so I won't be attending that, okay?

480
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,795
Thank you.

481
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,638
- Oh, my God!
- Mr. Cage.

482
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,677
If Mr. Gutierrez is asking you

483
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,194
to go with him
and see the cliffs,

484
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,816
you're gonna go with him
and see the cliffs.

485
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,160
And you're gonna love the cliffs.

486
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,719
Even if you hate the cliffs!

487
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,789
Are we clear?

488
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,554
Gabriela said you are really
excited about the cliffs.

489
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,758
Yeah, very much so.
It's just...

490
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,314
I'm not feeling tip-top
right now,

491
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,676
so if you wanna
go out there alone, I could

492
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,239
- go back to the room...
- Shit!

493
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,154
- Shit!!
- What?

494
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,072
We must go now.

495
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,754
Hey!

496
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Javi!

497
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,030
Javi!

498
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,554
What is going on?

499
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,755
Faster!

500
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,240
What are we running from?

501
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,040
The General!

502
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,754
Javi!

503
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Hey!

504
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,296
You need to tell me right now
what the hell is going on,

505
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,709
or I'm getting my shit,
and I'm going back to Los Angeles.

506
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
The General!

507
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,353
The General forbade me
to see his daughter Matilda.

508
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,557
But we defied his orders!

509
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,999
And now,
he wants to end my life.

510
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,634
Can't you see him?

511
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,231
All right, I gel it.

512
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,515
You're making this up?

513
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,835
What is this?

514
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,276
Like a little Stanislavski
improv thing?

515
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Well, you can stop.

516
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,591
Stanislavski?
Is he part of the resistance?

517
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,036
Slop! I am your guest!

518
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,229
Gabriela ripped the bedspread
off me this morning.

519
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,279
Now you're sending me
on, like, a wild goose chase!

520
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,670
I'm sorry, but you can't
quit acting! You can't!

521
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,353
That's none of your business.

522
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,556
Whether you like it or not,
you have a gift.

523
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,357
And that gift brings light
and joy to an increasingly...

524
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,198
dark and broken world!

525
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,430
And to turn your back
on that gift...

526
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,714
is to turn your back
on the entire human race.

527
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,074
The human race?

528
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,794
I'm afraid so.

529
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,429
What am I gonna do?

530
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,514
If we don't go now,
they will fucking kill us!

531
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,440
These people smell blood

532
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,856
- and they come running.
- What am I gonna do?

533
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,553
They're almost to the edge
of the forest.

534
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,915
I can hear them.

535
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,952
And Matilda,
she is waiting down the coast.

536
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,674
We have to go now!
We have to jump!

537
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,795
You're in an untenable situation.

538
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,310
You know that, right?

539
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,354
So tell me one thing.

540
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,070
Do you love her?

541
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,273
I've always loved her.

542
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,991
Then let's get you
out of here alive.

543
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,518
Shit!

544
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,675
Fuck!

545
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,680
Oh, God!

546
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,273
I didn't know there was a cliff!

547
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,839
I didn't know it was that high!

548
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,269
We could have died!

549
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,389
You're a wild man.

550
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,593
I prefer bourbon, but thank you.

551
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,758
God, this place is stunning.

552
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,639
I bet my daughter

553
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,597
would like it out here.
It'd be good for her.

554
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,795
Are you two close?

555
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,157
Well, it's impossible to be
close with a 16-year-old.

556
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,476
But I've tried to be there
for her. It's just...

557
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,392
There's no script for parenting.

558
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,600
Thank God for my ex, Olivia.

559
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,354
How did you meet Olivia?

560
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,672
She was a make-up artist
on <i>Captain Corelli's Mandolin.</i>

561
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,274
- Beautiful film.
- Thank you.

562
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,714
Underrated for sure.

563
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,400
We just hit it off, you know.

564
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,835
She was funny, smart, beautiful.

565
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,314
So, what happened?

566
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,275
What happened?

567
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
What about you?
Ever been married? Kids?

568
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
No.

569
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,799
There is one woman, but...

570
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,918
sometimes, circumstances
get in the way of love...

571
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,513
and that's just the way it is.

572
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,632
Anyway, Mr. Cage,

573
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,914
what is your favorite movie?

574
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,757
Favorite movie?

575
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,757
I mean, that... That is...

576
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,912
That's one of those questions
that's impossible to answer.

577
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,438
Because, you see,
100-plus years of rich cinema.

578
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,398
You can't just limit it to one.

579
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,915
It depends upon your mood,
the seasons.

580
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,597
All right, let's do top three.
You start.

581
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,554
Number one, <i>Face/Off.</i>

582
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,435
Thank you.

583
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,797
Woo is a maestro. Thank you.

584
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,038
Number two, let me think...

585
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,912
<i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>

586
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,310
You love <i>Caligari?</i>
I love <i>Caligari.</i>

587
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,670
I was beginning to think
I was the only one.

588
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,558
You gonna run
the table here, Jav?

589
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,998
It's hard. It's like you said,
100-plus years of rich cinema.

590
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,189
Thank you.

591
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,595
Look, can you just stop stalling

592
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,909
and answer the question?

593
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,355
What is your third favorite
movie of all time?

594
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
<i>Paddington 2.</i>

595
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,915
What?

596
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,832
<i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,
Paddington 2.</i>

597
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Connect those dots.

598
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,520
I mean, I don't wanna be
a snob, but...

599
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,079
I cried through
the entire thing.

600
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,594
It made me want
to be a better man.

601
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,195
Bullshit, man!

602
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,237
<i>Paddington 2</i> is incredible.

603
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,678
I fucking told you.

604
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,593
Truth or dare, Nick?

605
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,510
Truth.

606
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,072
Did you hate my screenplay?
It's okay if you did.

607
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,435
I just need to know.

608
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,398
You wrote a script?

609
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,199
I sent it to your agent.

610
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,520
He was supposed
to give it to you.

611
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,630
Well, he didn't.

612
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,996
I guess I can understand
why he didn't,

613
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,832
but where is it?
I'll read it right now.

614
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,639
- Now? Like, right now?
- Right now.

615
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Send it.

616
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,677
- I sent it.
- Fantastic.

617
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,236
Let's go into town,
have a celebratory drink.

618
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,152
You can watch me read it.

619
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,151
See where it drags.
It'll be fun.

620
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,515
No.

621
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,198
Honestly, I'm too nervous.

622
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,839
My heart is beating so fast.

623
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,479
I think I need to go to bed.

624
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,760
Listen, Javi, truth.

625
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,594
I wasn't that thrilled
about coming out here,

626
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,752
but tonight... has been
the most fun

627
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,878
I've had in a long, long time.

628
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,316
So, thank you.

629
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,509
Hey, Nicky.

630
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,319
So, you're unretired then?

631
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,834
That's the idea.

632
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,558
Javi inspired you, did he?
You like this guy?

633
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,677
He has good taste in movies.

634
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,797
Plus, it could be good
for me to do

635
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,111
some smaller roles
with great directors.

636
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,070
Some challenging character work.

637
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,311
So, like, um...
Like what?

638
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,959
The gay uncle

639
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,151
in the next Duplass Brothers
movie kind of thing?

640
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,240
Exactly.

641
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,277
What the fuck
are you talking about?

642
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,071
We haven't worked
since you were 15...

643
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,629
forty-one years
to be number seven

644
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,559
on a call sheet of a goddamn
student film.

645
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,080
I think it's a good idea.

646
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,434
You listen to me.

647
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,711
You're Nick fucking...

648
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,798
Cage!

649
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,990
Addy doesn't need a struggling artist
for a father.

650
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,991
She needs you to be a star.

651
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,433
Now you get the next one,
baby, and we're back.

652
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,954
Not that we went anywhere.

653
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,357
Not that we went anywhere.

654
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,075
Come here.

655
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,556
Yeah, Nick Cage smooches good.

656
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,674
You tell 'em!
Nick Cage smooches good!

657
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,000
I'll have another one.

658
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,475
Jesus!

659
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,237
What do you guys want?
You want money?

660
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,630
Here, take my watch.
It's not a copy, it's real.

661
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,633
Mr. Cage, we're with
the U.S. Government. We need your help.

662
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,598
The man you're staying with
is the head

663
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,512
of a violent
international arms cartel.

664
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,956
Wait, wait, wait... Javi?

665
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,713
He's a ruthless motherfucker.

666
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,791
He stalled small, coastal Spain.

667
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,359
But then, he got greedy.

668
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,273
Trying to expand
his operations east, west.

669
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,113
Trail of dead bodies
in his wake.

670
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Javi Gutierrez?

671
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,311
- Yes, Javi.
- I don't think we're talking

672
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
about the same Javi.

673
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,616
We're definitely talking about
the same fucking Javi.

674
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,856
It's the same fucking guy, man.

675
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,871
Okay. So, you're CIA,

676
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,598
some kind of intelligence, right?

677
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,478
And your job
is to read people, yeah?

678
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,676
Well, as a thespian,
that is also my job.

679
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,016
To understand
people's characters,

680
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,235
to feel what they're feeling.

681
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,711
Which is how I know
that Javi is not a gun dealer.

682
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,359
You're saying
your acting ability

683
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,113
trumps five years of hard data

684
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,510
collected by the world's
finest intelligence agency?

685
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,989
My nouveau shamanic
acting ability?

686
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,256
You better fucking believe it.

687
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,556
Hey, guys, this sucks.

688
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,712
Nicolas Cage's nouveau
shamanic acting ability

689
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,791
has determined
that we got the wrong guy.

690
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,235
So, let's pack up our shit
and fucking go home.

691
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,355
Hey, man, don't mind him.

692
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,789
He's all messed up inside.

693
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,110
He just found out his wife's
been fucking his dad.

694
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,669
That's not all the way true.

695
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,395
Look,
do you recognize this girl?

696
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
No.

697
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,635
It's Maria Delgado.

698
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,351
President of Catalonia's daughter.

699
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,033
Javi's men kidnapped her
two days ago

700
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,496
to force her father
out of the election

701
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,352
and make way for someone
more cartel-friendly.

702
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,919
Yeah, the U.S.
doesn't like that.

703
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,155
Yeah, look, hey.

704
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,710
We need to access
Javi's security cameras.

705
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,256
We can't get anywhere
near that compound

706
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,509
because it's too fortified.

707
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,715
And then, you show up.

708
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,354
So, you want me to, what?

709
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,794
Spy on Javi?

710
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Bingo.

711
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,515
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

712
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,640
You have a daughter
about her age, right?

713
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,434
This came in yesterday.

714
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,555
How do you think
you would feel, huh?

715
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,552
Knowing you could have helped?

716
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,313
<i>But you chose not to.</i>

717
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,679
<i>Be a lot of guilt to carry,
wouldn't it?</i>

718
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,832
<i>Because every time
you look at your daughter,</i>

719
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,354
<i>believe me,</i>

720
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,875
<i>you are gonna see
that little girl</i>

721
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,872
<i>buried in a ditch somewhere.</i>

722
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,511
<i>And that will haunt you</i>

723
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,911
<i>for the rest of your life.</i>

724
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,349
<i>A/I right, here we go, Nick.</i>

725
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,280
<i>We're going to create
a power blip big enough</i>

726
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,112
<i>to reboot
all the security cameras.</i>

727
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,315
<i>Once that happens,</i>

728
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,896
<i>you got exactly four minutes
and ten seconds...</i>

729
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,878
<i>to get in and get out
before they come back online.</i>

730
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,713
Don't forget.
Set the cameras,

731
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,433
<i>and then
grab them when you leave.</i>

732
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,000
Shit, we got a guy coming.

733
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,270
<i>Nick, guard on the way.</i>

734
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,680
<i>All right, Nick, stay calm.</i>

735
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,273
<i>Just like we talked about.</i>

736
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,795
Take the incapacitating agent
out of the pouch.

737
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
<i>Put it in your hand.</i>

738
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,594
<i>Remove the outer layer.</i>

739
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,677
<i>The inner layer
has the chemical on it.</i>

740
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,296
<i>Now, if you touch that
to someone's skin,</i>

741
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,719
<i>they'll be out in seconds.</i>

742
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,919
<i>Now, find a place to hide.</i>

743
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,718
There's nowhere to hide in here.

744
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,755
Hold on.

745
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,317
I think I can hide under the...

746
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,469
I touched my forehead.

747
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,240
You touched your forehead?

748
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,959
I think so.
I'm not 100% sure.

749
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,155
Did you or didn't you?

750
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,800
You know what?
I don't think I did.

751
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,677
I did. I did.

752
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,239
<i>Nick, listen to me right now.</i>

753
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,376
You have 30 seconds until
you're drooling on the floor.

754
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,199
<i>Go back into the pouch
and get the antidote ASAP.</i>

755
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,915
It's locked.

756
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,434
<i>Where's the key
that we gave you?</i>

757
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,235
Inside with the antidote.

758
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,438
- Fuck this shit!
- Okay. Oh, shit. Okay.

759
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,151
<i>Okay, Nick,
there's a window to your left.</i>

760
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,231
Go out that window, get outside,

761
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,594
go across the ledge, okay?

762
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,680
Scoot across the ledge,

763
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,837
<i>and then climb into
the security room window.</i>

764
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,816
What the fuck is wrong with
you? He's three stories up.

765
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,960
He's stoned out of his mind.

766
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,200
Ho/a.

767
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,560
<i>Do it now, Nick! Now!
He's getting closer.</i>

768
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,279
He's fucking dead. He's dead.

769
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,359
Martin, I can hear you.

770
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,512
Come on, Nick.
You can do this, okay?

771
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,591
Keep moving.

772
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,680
<i>Hola?</i>

773
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,749
I can't feel my legs.

774
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,797
You know, I really enjoyed
working for the CIA.

775
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,395
Can't wait to move back home
and work at fucking Sonic.

776
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
Shit!

777
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,119
Like rubber.

778
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,194
Come on, Nick, you got this.
Keep moving, okay?

779
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,031
<i>Hold on.
We got a guard in the room.</i>

780
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,635
<i>Wake up, Nick.</i>

781
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,438
<i>Okay, go, go, go, Nick.</i>

782
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,353
I love you.

783
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,957
<i>Stay with me.
Stay awake.</i>

784
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,277
<i>Keep moving.
You can do this.</i>

785
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,635
<i>Pull your legs in now.</i>

786
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,160
<i>Pull your legs in.</i>

787
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,279
I can't move.

788
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,320
Then you're gonna die.
Do you wanna die tonight?

789
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,873
This is not how you die.

790
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,075
I think it is.

791
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,520
Come on.

792
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,478
Come on, you did it.
You're in there.

793
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,914
Do it! Stay awake!

794
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,793
<i>Come on!
Come on, Nick!</i>

795
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,234
- Come on.
- Come on.

796
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,515
- Come on.
- You got it.

797
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,829
You got it.

798
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,439
You got it.

799
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,831
- For fuck's sake, man!
- Wake up!

800
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
<i>- Wake up.
- Wake up.</i>

801
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,913
<i>Get up, Nick. Get up.</i>

802
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,195
<i>Get up.</i>

803
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,120
Come on, Nick.

804
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,838
Come on! Get up!

805
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,629
<i>Get up, Nick.</i>

806
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
Action!

807
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,920
Oh, my God!

808
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Yes!

809
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,877
- How is he up?
- Trained actor.

810
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,439
All right, man, we in.

811
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,956
You know, it didn't feel great
betraying Javi like that.

812
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,913
Especially, since I'm still
not convinced he's your guy.

813
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,758
But the strange thing is...

814
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,136
I can see myself
doing more of this stuff.

815
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,275
You know, spy craft.

816
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,592
Subterfuge. What have you.

817
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,680
I think I might have
a real gift for it.

818
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,592
Good, 'cause we got
another mission for you.

819
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,189
No, no, no! Fuck that!

820
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,589
It was terrifying.

821
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,040
I'm about to leave for the
airport after the party, so...

822
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,636
Nick, our intel suggests that
Javi is holding Maria Delgado

823
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,552
on the compound right now.

824
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,233
- On the compound?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

825
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,799
We need you to help us find her.

826
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,995
Which means we need you

827
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,800
to figure out a way
to stay a little longer.

828
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,956
Vivian, I can't do this.

829
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,111
Yes, you can.
We just saw you do it.

830
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,439
That little girl, Nick?

831
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,034
She doesn't have anybody else.

832
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
<i>Just you.</i>

833
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,437
<i>And if you leave,</i>

834
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,158
<i>I don't know
what's gonna happen to her.</i>

835
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,670
I just want to thank you all
for coming tonight.

836
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,759
It means more to me
than you can know.

837
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,516
And I would like
to tell a story.

838
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,874
A few years ago,

839
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,158
my relationship with my father

840
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,351
had deteriorated to the point

841
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,636
where we were
no longer speaking.

842
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,600
He could be extremely difficult,

843
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
my father.

844
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,797
And to be fair,
maybe I am not much better.

845
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,839
But when he got sick,

846
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,269
I realized

847
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,673
I didn't want to lose him

848
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,952
before we could repair
our broken relationship.

849
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,434
But I didn't know how.

850
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
And then, one day,

851
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,996
about a week before he died,
it happened.

852
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,195
A miracle.

853
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,150
I looked up...

854
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,473
and I saw on a tiny
little hospital TV...

855
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,314
<i>Guarding Tess.</i>

856
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,834
We disagreed about literally
everything, my father and I.

857
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,354
Except for this movie.

858
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,949
We both loved it.

859
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,796
We would quote it
back and forth.

860
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,915
In a way, my father was Tess.

861
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,949
The former First Lady.

862
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,430
And I was Doug Chesnic.

863
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,913
The Secret Service agent
charged with taking care of him.

864
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,959
That movie brought us together.

865
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,033
So, on behalf of
my late father and myself,

866
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,559
I want to thank you.

867
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,597
I bet you didn't know
Doug Chesnic could have

868
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,239
such an impact on someone.

869
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,831
Well, Doug was a complicated guy.

870
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,553
He had...

871
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,040
competing allegiances

872
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,554
and sometimes,

873
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,951
being in the skin
of a character like that...

874
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,354
can take its toll.

875
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,040
Well, thank you
for your sacrifice.

876
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,349
It was extraordinary.

877
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,158
Thank you for having me.

878
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,800
And I'm...

879
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,955
I'm...

880
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,436
excited to announce that

881
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,630
Javi has finally allowed me
to read his screenplay

882
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,791
which is fantastic.

883
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,871
It's truly a masterclass.

884
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,520
It's easily one of the best
things I've read in years.

885
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,512
So, does that mean
that you want to be in it?

886
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,680
I don't.

887
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,434
But what I would like is to...

888
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,316
spend a little more time here

889
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,154
on the compound, with you.

890
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,631
Coming up with our own...

891
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,755
movie.

892
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,510
What do you say?

893
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,590
I say yes.

894
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,840
Yes.

895
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,475
<i>I fired Earl.</i>

896
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,519
<i>- This has happened twice now.
- No.</i>

897
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,991
<i>He is a driver
in the employ of the Secret Service.</i>

898
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,976
<i>I can't do anything
about the cook or the nurse.</i>

899
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,320
<i>No, they work for you.</i>

900
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,198
<i>But this guy works for us
and he's gone!</i>

901
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
<i>Nick.</i>

902
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,593
The security cameras gave us
a probable location for Maria.

903
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,079
I'm sending it to you now.

904
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,879
<i>Find a way
to get into that room, Nick.</i>

905
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
Mr. Cage.

906
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,232
- Hey, Javi.
- Nick.

907
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,835
I realized...

908
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,469
that if we are going to create
a work of art,

909
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,711
we can't just sit and stare
at a screen.

910
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,749
We have to open our minds

911
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,274
to the infinite possibilities

912
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,839
of what the cosmos has to offer.

913
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,755
What have you got there?

914
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,718
Divine inspiration.

915
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,800
LSD.

916
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,440
Fuck it!

917
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,591
So, I was thinking
that maybe our movie

918
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,159
would be character-driven.

919
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,360
Yeah.

920
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,674
Something that doesn't rely
on corny special effects.

921
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,036
Right. Or like big explosions.

922
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,799
It has to be nuanced.

923
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,678
And work on multiple levels.

924
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,434
It should be completely
about performance.

925
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,194
And maybe it's just
the drugs talking,

926
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,320
but what if we had
like a big drug scene?

927
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,151
It's gonna be so fucking good.

928
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,320
But, like,

929
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,715
what's it about?

930
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,476
<i>In terms of genre,
I like comedies.</i>

931
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,758
But not when it's just two people
sitting around talking.

932
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,356
Man, I can't stand talkie comedies.

933
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,875
You gotta have some plot
to drive it forward.

934
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,360
It's my daughter.

935
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,434
Nick, listen.

936
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,834
You know what I was thinking?

937
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,758
Maybe we could have, like,
a paranoid thriller-y angle.

938
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,750
Paranoid angle.
Excellent.

939
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,277
Like, see those two guys
over there?

940
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,795
They've been watching us.

941
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,280
Right.

942
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,999
Wait, have they been
watching us?

943
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,317
I don't know. Have they?

944
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,717
Fuck!

945
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,511
Did you see that?
They just looked over at us.

946
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,552
Shit!

947
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,876
Shit! What's going on?

948
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,776
No, no, no. Maybe it was
just a coincidence.

949
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,056
I will look again.
Are you ready?

950
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,354
No! Don't make eye contact.

951
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,794
That's how you spook them.

952
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,314
No, that's how you spook a bear.

953
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,077
That's right.
That is how you spook a bear.

954
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,275
I apologize.

955
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,996
But if you are gonna look,
maybe do like a fake laugh.

956
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,958
- A fake laugh? Okay, good.
- Yeah.

957
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,229
Oh, no.

958
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,391
Okay. Let's...

959
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,549
Let's just get up slowly

960
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,994
on the count of three

961
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,355
and run.

962
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,880
Okay?

963
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,355
One...

964
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,400
Fuck!

965
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,109
Go, go, go!

966
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,200
Faster!

967
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,479
Do you see them?

968
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,790
Shit!

969
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,915
It's too high.

970
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,399
Here.

971
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,472
Use me as a human stool.

972
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,835
Do it!

973
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,480
Grab my hand.

974
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,280
Grab it.

975
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,560
You're heavier than you look.

976
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,789
I have a very big head.

977
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,156
Enormous. An enormous head.

978
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,789
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

979
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,633
Will you tell Gabriela
I will miss her?

980
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,558
- You can tell her yourself.
- No.

981
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,189
It's okay.
You go live a good life.

982
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,680
I'm not going anywhere
without you!

983
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,990
Now, grab my hand, soldier!

984
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,238
But then, we will both die

985
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,200
and I could never
live with myself after that...

986
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,554
so you let go.

987
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,680
You let go!

988
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,274
Goodbye, Nicolas Cage.

989
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,839
I'll never forget you, Javs.

990
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,759
I'll never forget you.

991
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,550
Now, you get the hell
out of here.

992
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,118
YOU go!

993
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,389
Mr. Cage?

994
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,480
Javi?

995
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,914
- Buddy!
- Hey.

996
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,114
Where'd you come from?

997
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,475
Yeah...

998
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,896
Turns out we could have just
walked around.

999
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,991
- Yeah, I guess so, huh?
- Whatever.

1000
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,035
There they are.

1001
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,109
Oh, shit! Run!

1002
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,759
Do you see 'em?

1003
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,669
Fuck!

1004
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,189
Shit!

1005
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,470
No, no. I can't drive on acid.

1006
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,789
You have to drive on acid.

1007
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,160
You are a better driver than me.

1008
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,280
How do you know that?

1009
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,416
Because I read that you did
all of your own driving stunts

1010
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,555
<i>in Gone in 60 Seconds.</i>

1011
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,280
Well, that's true. I popped
some good wheelies, right?

1012
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,795
The wheelies are amazing.
Now drive the car!

1013
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,633
They're coming! Let's go!

1014
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,039
- Shit!
- What?

1015
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,395
Holy shit!

1016
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,480
What? Do you see 'em?

1017
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,438
No, Nick, I have an idea.

1018
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,795
Maybe this movie,
maybe ifs about this.

1019
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,639
About us.

1020
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,598
Our relationship.

1021
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,790
That's good.

1022
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,555
That's good.

1023
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,395
Is anyone in there?

1024
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,989
<i>Hola?</i>

1025
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,080
Hello?

1026
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,520
Hello?

1027
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,437
You want me to let you in there?

1028
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,160
I do.

1029
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,594
I wanna know what's inside.

1030
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,956
Regardless of what
the consequences are?

1031
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,158
Because once you go in there,

1032
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,957
it could change the way
you feel about me.

1033
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,079
Our entire relationship
could change, Nick Cage.

1034
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,272
I need to go in, Jav.

1035
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,113
Open the door.

1036
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,674
Is it too much?

1037
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,715
Trippy.

1038
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,269
Trippy.

1039
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,949
I know.
I am sorry if it is weird.

1040
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,077
Well, it's a good collection.

1041
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,033
It's very thorough.

1042
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,272
“A really elegant string
of pearls configuration."

1043
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,360
<i>The Rock.</i>

1044
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,154
"Put the bunny
back in the box."

1045
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,640
<i>Con Air.</i>

1046
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,149
Well, that's just really creepy.

1047
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,114
No, ifs not creepy.

1048
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,073
Is that the chainsaw from <i>Mandy?</i>

1049
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,600
<i>Mandy</i> is a masterpiece.

1050
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,953
You know
those are real guns, right?

1051
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,719
Of course they are real.

1052
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,351
Custom Springfield Armory.

1053
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,356
Made specifically for the film.

1054
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,072
Is this supposed to be me?

1055
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,915
It's...

1056
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,629
grotesque.

1057
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,274
Just look at the guns.

1058
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,952
If you don't mind me asking,

1059
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,270
how much did you pay for this

1060
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,037
disturbing statue?

1061
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,350
About $6,000.

1062
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,798
L'I| give you $20,000 for it.

1063
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,918
I'm sorry, Mr. Cage,

1064
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,279
but this is not for sale.

1065
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,598
<i>Bad news.
Girl's not there.</i>

1066
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,194
Good news. Script's cooking.

1067
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,110
Feels like
Cassavetes meets inarritu

1068
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,429
with a dash of Von Trier.

1069
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,910
- Nick, but...
- I know what you're gonna say.

1070
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,390
Javi has his issues but, my God,

1071
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,359
he has an unbelievably
intuitive sense for story.

1072
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,158
He kidnapped a young girl.

1073
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,596
And every day that passes,
the likelihood goes up

1074
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,752
that she's gonna be murdered
by Javi or one of his men.

1075
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,514
What do you want me to do now?

1076
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,750
I don't know.

1077
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,399
I'm still figuring that out.

1078
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,674
But for now, why don't you add
a plotline to your movie

1079
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,194
where someone gets kidnapped?

1080
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,435
That way you can see

1081
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,160
where he might,
theoretically, hide a hostage.

1082
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,038
I'm working two jobs here.

1083
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,835
Okay.

1084
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,910
Vivian,

1085
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,354
this is a grounded, adult drama

1086
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,956
about two tough, sensitive men
and their unlikely friendship.

1087
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,576
They're kind of like
dueling Christ figures.

1088
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,309
Which is obviously a pretty
revolutionary idea in itself.

1089
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,312
But what is not...

1090
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,793
a revolutionary idea
is a kidnapping.

1091
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,633
And if I bring that
into the mix,

1092
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,976
Javi's gonna know
something's up.

1093
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,149
He's a hardliner for tone,

1094
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,277
and this mission
will be blown. Okay?

1095
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,038
Jesus fucking Christ!

1096
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,960
You know, Nick,

1097
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,439
I think a kidnapping

1098
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,080
could give this movie
a wider appeal.

1099
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,679
I mean, it's pretty hard

1100
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,512
to find an audience
these days, right?

1101
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,955
Unless you're a Marvel movie,
<i>Star Wars,</i> whatever, yeah.

1102
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,536
Yeah, doesn't sound like
this is that.

1103
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,755
No, Vivian, ii isn't.

1104
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,076
This is an intelligent film
for grown-ups.

1105
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,435
Now, personally,

1106
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,479
I want a smart,
character-driven, adult drama

1107
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,280
about real life, real people.

1108
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,839
But the reality is,

1109
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,640
most people need a bit of a hook

1110
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,915
to get 'em into the theater.

1111
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,638
Okay, now you're talking
about marketing.

1112
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,016
And if you're talking
about marketing,

1113
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,112
then, yes, you do need a hook
to get them into the theater.

1114
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,191
Well, get 'em
into the theater. Come on.

1115
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,556
All you need
is a trailer moment.

1116
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,709
Pull!

1117
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,600
Hold on.
Your daughter gets kidnapped?

1118
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,159
Yeah, it's a big trailer moment.

1119
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,594
Hey, am I doing this right?

1120
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,159
'Cause I had that thing
in my sights.

1121
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,240
But who kidnaps her?

1122
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,400
Maybe the barrel's warped.

1123
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,880
The barrel
is definitely not warped.

1124
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,080
Who kidnaps her?

1125
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,755
Bad guys.

1126
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,149
We both put our lives
on the line to save the daughter

1127
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,436
and become better men for it.
It's classic.

1128
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,016
It feels like a completely
different movie.

1129
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,040
Javi, please.

1130
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,396
Just walk down the road
with me on this.

1131
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,480
And then what?

1132
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,719
The finale is about two men
saving the girl?

1133
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,995
That's terrible.

1134
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,754
Give me the gun.

1135
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,598
You know
the key to shooting well?

1136
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,674
Controlling your breath.

1137
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,431
And you know how to control
your breath, Nick?

1138
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,595
Your heart.

1139
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,070
Your heart must be still.

1140
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,709
At peace.

1141
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,195
My heart

1142
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,949
is not still.

1143
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,509
My heart

1144
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,120
is not at peace.

1145
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,910
Do you know why?

1146
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,275
Hey, Javi.

1147
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,795
If you're not gonna shoot,
maybe hand me the gun?

1148
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,473
Because you're lying to me.

1149
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,600
What?

1150
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,957
Don't fucking lie to me.

1151
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,040
I'm not!

1152
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,680
Don't fucking lie to me!

1153
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,398
Oh, my God, I'm not!
I swear!

1154
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,835
I know why you keep on talking
about this kidnapped girl.

1155
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,096
You feel guilty
about your relationship

1156
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,315
to your own daughter.

1157
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,754
Oh, my God, yes.

1158
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,631
- A thousand times, yes.
- You are blocked.

1159
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,479
Creatively.

1160
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,035
Because you feel guilty

1161
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,793
about what kind of father
you have been.

1162
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,799
You're right. Yep.

1163
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,360
You're 100% right.

1164
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,440
Pull!

1165
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,477
Vivian, what's going on?

1166
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,710
Nick, you need to get
out of that house immediately.

1167
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,632
<i>The Agency caught a wiretap
on our phones.</i>

1168
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,473
<i>Then I picked up a guy
tailing me.</i>

1169
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,075
If they've made me,
they've likely made you.

1170
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,355
All right. Shit!

1171
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,670
<i>Nick, we can no longer
guarantee your safety.</i>

1172
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,800
Jesus Christ!

1173
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,240
You scared the hell out of me.

1174
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,472
Nick,
I need you to come with me.

1175
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,950
Right now?

1176
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,640
I'm sorry
to have to take this step, Nick.

1177
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,514
You don't, though.
You really don't.

1178
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,193
No, it is the only option.

1179
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,876
Can I just
call my family quickly?

1180
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,919
Tell them I love them.

1181
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,829
What?

1182
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,399
There's no need to call them.

1183
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,955
They are here.

1184
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,355
- Dad.
- Nick.

1185
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,475
Are you okay? What...

1186
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,153
What the hell is going on?

1187
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,320
Your friend called to say

1188
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,118
you were so sick
you couldn't talk.

1189
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,998
- We're worried about you.
- Yeah.

1190
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,000
You wanna deal with
me, Javi? You deal with me.

1191
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,680
But I'm begging you, please,
please leave my family out of this.

1192
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,280
Unfortunately, I can't do that.

1193
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,320
You've left me no choice.

1194
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,232
- Are you dying, Dad?
- Yes.

1195
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,760
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1196
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,553
- Creatively.
- Oh, come on.

1197
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,080
No, physically,
he is tremendous.

1198
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,276
I mean, he will probably
outlive us all.

1199
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,359
So, you're not even sick?

1200
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,955
I'm okay, honey.

1201
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,096
- I'm fine. I'm okay.
- Fuck you.

1202
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,590
Look, I have grown to care
very deeply about your father.

1203
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,989
And ex-husband.

1204
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,520
We are working
on a movie together.

1205
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,634
A beautiful character-driven,
adult drama.

1206
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,999
But he has so many
unresolved issues with you

1207
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,152
that it is beginning to bleed
into the work

1208
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,436
in a negative way.
Isn't that right, Nick?

1209
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,955
Are you both
out of your fucking minds?

1210
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,753
Well, you see,
he has so many regrets.

1211
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,554
Yeah. Well, here is another
one to add to the list.

1212
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,154
We've been on a plane.

1213
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,914
All day!

1214
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,389
I had to cancel clients.

1215
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,480
We were panicking

1216
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,696
because we couldn't find
anyone to feed the cats.

1217
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,776
You know, they could be dead

1218
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,837
by the time we get home
after this bullshit.

1219
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,157
House smelling like
a dead cat. That's great.

1220
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,469
That's fun.

1221
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,358
Well, I had a cat die
in the kitchen once.

1222
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,976
And my grandmother
was never able

1223
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,035
to get rid of the smell.

1224
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,918
I am very sorry
for the inconvenience,

1225
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,479
but this is an emergency.

1226
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,960
Have lunch with us.

1227
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,433
And let him say
what he has to say.

1228
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,193
Don't you think
that's a good idea, Nick?

1229
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,239
Lunch is a wonderful idea, Javi.

1230
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,997
And then, afterwards,
they can go home, right?

1231
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,275
Great.

1232
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,078
Let's have some fucking tapas.

1233
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,160
This is so weird.

1234
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,674
Yeah, well... That's...

1235
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,955
What'd you expect?

1236
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,073
I wanna apologize
to both of you.

1237
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,950
I think I should have been
more present

1238
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,599
while I was at home.

1239
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,592
I didn't always need
to be focused on my work.

1240
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,035
My face in a script.

1241
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,753
But here's what
I keep coming back to.

1242
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,472
Would either of you
have wanted to prevent me

1243
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,233
from living my artistic dreams?

1244
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,960
Because I sure know
I wouldn't have wanted that

1245
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,553
for either of you.

1246
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,356
We flew to Mallorca for that?

1247
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,919
Wow.

1248
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,152
- That was fucking pathetic.
- God, it really was, wasn't it?

1249
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,833
No, no, no.
I am honestly speechless.

1250
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,389
Really? Because this shit,
you get used to it.

1251
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,272
Yeah, that's pretty much
par for the course.

1252
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,670
Can't we just focus

1253
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,990
on the good times
we did have together?

1254
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,791
Addy, that trip we took
across the desert.

1255
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,758
I never showed you this before,

1256
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,752
but I keep this little photo
in my wallet

1257
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,798
to remind me
of all the fun we had.

1258
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,473
And I know it wasn't great,

1259
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,597
but that song...

1260
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,718
I meant that moment
that I wrote in that song.

1261
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,355
- I meant it.
- You didn't write it.

1262
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,474
You got drunk
and you made it up,

1263
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,313
because you couldn't stand
not being the center of attention

1264
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,311
- for two fucking seconds.
- Addy.

1265
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,711
Because everything
always has to be about you.

1266
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,313
What you like.

1267
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,114
What books you've read.
What movies you're into.

1268
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,919
It's fucked up, you know?

1269
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,599
Like, I'm your daughter

1270
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,153
and I get nervous.

1271
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,756
Like, debilitating
fucking anxiety

1272
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,592
that if I don't like
what you like,

1273
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,273
you won't like me.

1274
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,919
Addy, I was sharing the things
that were meaningful to me.

1275
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,070
That were important to me.

1276
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,356
No, you weren't.
You weren't.

1277
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,080
You were trying to mold me
into this little version of you.

1278
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,753
Mold you?

1279
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,470
Guide you.
Addy, I love you.

1280
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,678
I love you more than anything
in the world.

1281
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,832
And I want you to know
I was trying.

1282
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,078
I know.
I know you were trying.

1283
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,473
You're always trying.

1284
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,590
Fuck, that's actually
the saddest part.

1285
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,760
Shit!

1286
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,709
I think we have more work than
I realized, but this is good.

1287
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,400
This is very good.

1288
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,630
This is a good first step.

1289
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,037
Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Gutierrez,

1290
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,918
but you have a visitor.

1291
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,035
<i>Gracias.</i>

1292
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:37,918
Hollywood Javi.
There he is.

1293
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,117
I have some news for you.

1294
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,279
Javi Ford Coppola.

1295
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,197
Sit. Eat with me.

1296
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,994
Froot Loops?

1297
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,795
Delicious.

1298
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,355
Taste it.

1299
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,869
I love Froot Loops.

1300
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,755
Sergio Baldassari?

1301
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,800
Yeah.

1302
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,759
But I can't do
a deal with the Italians...

1303
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,279
if I am being betrayed.

1304
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,112
He flew my wife and daughter

1305
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,256
all the way out to Mallorca.

1306
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,280
My family!

1307
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,360
Shit!

1308
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,959
No, don't say "shit"!

1309
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,952
You got us into this.
You get us out of this.

1310
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,110
<i>There's no way</i>

1311
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,111
we can mobilize
an extraction in time.

1312
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,839
Then, what am I supposed to do?

1313
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,514
If you can get Javi alone,
and then take him out,

1314
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,870
<i>it'll buy the Agency time
to get you all out of there.</i>

1315
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,758
Do you have access to a firearm?

1316
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,155
I might.

1317
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,753
<i>Nick, I'm sorry, but this</i>

1318
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,797
<i>is the best way
to safeguard your family.</i>

1319
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,036
Listen, I need you
to be honest with me.

1320
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,256
What the fuck is happening?

1321
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,600
Okay.

1322
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,159
I'm going to tell you something,

1323
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,560
but please don't freak out.

1324
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,151
I'm working for the CIA.

1325
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,096
Are you having
a nervous breakdown?

1326
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,430
Probably.
But I'm telling you the truth.

1327
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,736
They wanted some information
on Javi's business dealings

1328
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,800
so I've been helping them.

1329
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,776
And the strange thing is,
it does kind of make sense

1330
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,474
given that so much of acting
is like spying.

1331
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,040
Do you have any idea
how this sounds?

1332
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,031
'Cause, I mean, it's not good.

1333
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,431
Okay, I need an hour
to do one final thing for them

1334
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,555
and when I get back,

1335
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,519
the three of us will fly to
Los Angeles together, okay?

1336
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,112
I don't know what to say.

1337
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,039
Don't say anything.
Just take Addy back to my room.

1338
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,912
Don't talk to anyone.
Don't go anywhere.

1339
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,752
<i>I'll</i> be back to get you.
I promise.

1340
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,920
I love you.

1341
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,509
Your friend, Nicolas Cage,

1342
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,393
the fucking star of Hollywood

1343
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,756
is working
for the U.S. government.

1344
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,999
Oh, bullshit!

1345
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,349
Bullshit!

1346
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,635
Bullshit!

1347
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,354
Bullshit!

1348
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:31,875
Listen.

1349
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,035
<i>I see myself doing more</i>

1350
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,713
<i>of this stuff.
You know, spy craft.</i>

1351
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,513
<i>Subterfuge. What have you.</i>

1352
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,713
<i>I think I might have</i>
a <i>real gift for it.</i>

1353
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,076
<i>Good, 'cause we got
another mission for you.</i>

1354
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,800
No.

1355
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,393
Lucas, no.

1356
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,155
Lucas.

1357
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,671
No! No, no, no!

1358
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,914
I would love
to believe you, <i>primo.</i>

1359
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,754
But either I kill you,

1360
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,235
or you kill Nicolas Cage.

1361
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,274
Your choice.

1362
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,680
Hi.

1363
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,835
<i>Hey.</i>

1364
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,149
I'm sorry.

1365
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,593
I should have asked you
before bringing them down.

1366
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,675
Yeah.

1367
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,599
And I was thinking

1368
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,231
maybe a kidnapping would work.

1369
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,559
Our movie would start out
as a beautiful character piece

1370
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,075
and then, slowly change
into a more thrilling...

1371
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,912
Hollywood blockbuster.

1372
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,590
Then there's something
for everyone.

1373
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,951
Would you like to drive out
to the cliffs?

1374
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,994
Clear our heads, and think
through the third act?

1375
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,315
Perfect.

1376
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,320
So...

1377
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,075
We should go.

1378
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,995
Yeah.

1379
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,995
Are those new shoes?

1380
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,080
These?

1381
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,958
No, I've had these.

1382
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,114
I haven't seen them before.

1383
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,475
I don't wear them very much.

1384
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,880
I don't think they're really me.

1385
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,069
What?

1386
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,271
They're great.
They look incredible on you.

1387
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,238
They're totally you.
Love 'em.

1388
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:25,760
Do you wanna try them on?

1389
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,638
I think they would look
amazing on you.

1390
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,994
Those look incredible on you.

1391
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,997
- I like how those look on you.
- Yeah.

1392
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,075
You wanna trade?

1393
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,715
Like, permanently?

1394
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,560
Okay.

1395
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,349
Cool.

1396
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:04,638
I'm really glad
I got to meet you.

1397
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,997
You're the kind of friend
I could...

1398
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,116
not see for years,
and not even really talk to

1399
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,391
and just pick up
right where we left off.

1400
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,834
I totally agree.

1401
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,313
It's just...

1402
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,515
- easy.
- Easy.

1403
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,400
Well...

1404
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,960
I guess it's time to figure out

1405
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,360
how this thing ends.

1406
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,040
Nick...

1407
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,077
I meant what I said back there.

1408
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,109
Me, too.

1409
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,311
Which is why this really hurts.

1410
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,475
Javi.

1411
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,116
You brought me out here
to kill me, man?

1412
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,315
I'm sorry, Nick.

1413
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,549
So am I.

1414
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,751
'Cause you pull that trigger
and we're both dead.

1415
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,309
Wait.
You were gonna kill me?

1416
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,678
And are those my golden guns?

1417
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,320
They're my golden guns.

1418
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,616
And it looks like we both had
a little secret, doesn't it?

1419
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,880
Why the fuck would you kill me?

1420
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,798
You're the head
of a criminal organization.

1421
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,713
My cousin, Lucas, is the head
of the organization.

1422
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,678
CIA said you ran it.

1423
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,558
The whole world thinks I run it.

1424
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,589
When my father died,
Lucas took over.

1425
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,318
He forced me
to be the figurehead.

1426
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,470
You take his money.

1427
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,870
You don't just leave
this world, Nick.

1428
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,993
You and everyone you care
about is in constant danger.

1429
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,760
Why do you think
I cannot be with Gabriela?

1430
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,559
You're into Gabriela?

1431
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,074
Are you fucking kidding me?

1432
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,280
I can't be with Gabriella,

1433
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,736
because that would
put a target on her back.

1434
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,856
Wait, you seriously
didn't realize

1435
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:58,915
that we liked each other?

1436
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,070
You're in the CIA!

1437
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,514
I'm not in the CIA.

1438
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,280
I'm a goddamn actor.
You know that.

1439
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,354
The only organization
I'm a part of

1440
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,676
is the Screen Actors Guild
of America.

1441
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,456
And AFTRA. But I don't
even know what that is.

1442
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,440
I think it's a radio thing.
Just put down the gun.

1443
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,515
No way. You go first.

1444
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,376
I'm not going first. You
brought my family out here.

1445
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,471
- This is so fucked!
- I don't wanna kill you.

1446
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,936
You're the last person
I wanna kill.

1447
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,951
- I fucking love you!
- I love you!

1448
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:27,800
It's my cousin.

1449
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,400
He must have known
I wouldn't kill you.

1450
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,480
I thought so.

1451
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,153
Which is why
I should always trust

1452
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,231
my shamanic instincts
as a thespian.

1453
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,876
Fuck!

1454
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,038
- Faster!
- I'm trying.

1455
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,352
Your shoes don't offer
any ankle support

1456
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,438
Fuck!

1457
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,636
Okay. You just run out there.
You get the truck.

1458
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,791
You come back and get me.
I will keep a lookout.

1459
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,470
Love it.
Love the plan.

1460
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,896
But given that you've saddled me

1461
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,480
with what basically amounts
to fucking penny loafers

1462
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,392
maybe you should go,
and I'll stay here.

1463
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,073
I love that plan, I do.

1464
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,197
But you are a faster runner
than me,

1465
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,634
even with subpar footwear.

1466
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,376
I saw how fast you were
in <i>National Treasure.</i>

1467
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,993
No, that'd be
the stunt department.

1468
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,117
Not according to
the <i>Making Of</i> featurette.

1469
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,038
- Fine, I'll go.
- Wait!

1470
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,480
So, you're gonna go?
I'm going with you.

1471
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,235
There they are!

1472
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,600
Shit!

1473
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,400
He's coming up on us.

1474
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:04,880
On your left!

1475
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,799
Holy shit!

1476
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,040
- Brakes!
- What?

1477
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,616
Hit the brakes. He will hit
the back of the truck.

1478
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,994
- That won't work.
- Yes, it will.

1479
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,832
Just do it.
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1480
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,633
Don't worry,
he's totally passed out.

1481
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,913
Fuck!

1482
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,796
I'm okay.
Are you okay?

1483
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,440
Liv.

1484
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,056
- They took Addy, Nick.
- They took Addy?

1485
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,096
She went outside to find you
and they just grabbed her.

1486
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,920
There are more soldiers
coming. We have to go.

1487
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,560
Fuck!

1488
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,154
Vivian? Hello.

1489
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,336
<i>Nick, I've sent you the address.</i>

1490
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,395
<i>You on the way?</i>

1491
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,278
What? They have my daughter.

1492
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,589
What do they want with her?

1493
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,000
<i>Unfortunately, she's being used</i>

1494
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,376
<i>to put pressure
on the U. S. Government</i>

1495
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,437
<i>so they'll back off
their support of Delgado.</i>

1496
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,876
<i>And unless Delgado
drops out of the election...</i>

1497
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,959
<i>Nick, I'm sorry,</i>

1498
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,236
<i>but they said
they're gonna kill both girls.</i>

1499
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,389
What? What?

1500
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,153
You're gonna get him
to dropout, right?

1501
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,639
You're gonna get him
to drop out!

1502
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,150
Just come directly here.

1503
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,794
Fucking...

1504
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,976
His people
could still be in the area.

1505
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,479
- We have to go.
- Where?

1506
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,278
I have a place.
Let's go.

1507
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,714
- Let's go.
- Come. Come now.

1508
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:40,718
So, what's the plan here?

1509
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:44,390
You gonna be a big hero?
Save Addy yourself?

1510
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,597
You'll end up dead like her.

1511
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,552
Leave it to the professionals.

1512
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,038
Cal police. Whomever.

1513
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,713
There is no one else.

1514
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,434
I love you.

1515
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,392
And I have always
looked out for you.

1516
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,273
Get off of me!

1517
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,555
I have to go in there.

1518
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,109
Because Addy has to know
I fought for her.

1519
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,034
I'm trying to help you,
and you won't listen!

1520
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,713
How are you helping me?

1521
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,519
How are you ever helping me?

1522
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,397
You need to know
who you are, Nick.

1523
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,194
This isn't a role.

1524
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,360
You're not a hero.

1525
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,591
<i>You're just some guy
who's about to get us killed.</i>

1526
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,318
<i>You fucking idiot!</i>

1527
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,558
I bought this house 20 years ago

1528
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,756
for a situation just like this.

1529
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,036
It has everything we need.
Food, passports,

1530
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,838
materials for disguise.

1531
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,155
We'll be safe for the night.

1532
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,555
Olivia,

1533
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,677
I promise you will get
your daughter back.

1534
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,474
The girls are likely being held

1535
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,914
in my cousin's compound.

1536
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,117
It is a monastery
that they use as a cover,

1537
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,270
but it is a fortress.

1538
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,670
It is impenetrable.
There are walls on every side.

1539
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,955
Any escape routes?

1540
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,952
Tunnels. But with metal doors

1541
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,713
that only open from the inside.

1542
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,176
Even if it weren't
for all of the armed guards,

1543
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,952
ii is impossible to get in.

1544
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,555
I mean, this psychopath
is gonna kill our daughter

1545
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,675
in 12 hours.

1546
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,671
So, what the fuck
are we gonna do?

1547
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:41,236
We are going to walk straight
in through the front gate.

1548
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:46,156
Okay, cool.
Very dramatic answer.

1549
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,719
How's that supposed to work?

1550
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,536
Lucas is trying
to form an alliance

1551
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,560
with Sergio Baldassari,

1552
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,392
the head
of the Calabero crime family.

1553
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,757
Baldassari, I mean, no one
has seen him for 15 years.

1554
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,389
Exactly.
And since no one has seen him

1555
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,797
no one knows exactly
what he looks like.

1556
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,510
Olivia.

1557
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,936
Nick says
that you were an incredible

1558
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,155
makeup artist when you met.

1559
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,914
So, with some prosthetics
and a little makeup...

1560
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,392
Then I could play Sergio.

1561
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,394
Lucas Gutierrez!

1562
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,991
I'd like to introduce
my wife, Barbara.

1563
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,277
Why for? She was born
in Santa Barbara, California.

1564
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,349
You think I'm fucking stupid, Sergio?

1565
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,309
You think you're just gonna
walk in here after 15 years

1566
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,590
and kill me, you motherfucker?

1567
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,557
He's cutting my fucking ear off!

1568
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,472
Who are you working for?
Three seconds.

1569
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,119
- It's just me!
- Two!

1570
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,395
I promise!

1571
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,274
You think she can help you, Sergio?

1572
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,040
Go ahead.

1573
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,393
You kill him,
I'll still make the deal.

1574
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,118
But I don't think
you're gonna kill him.

1575
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,354
You don't think I'll kill him?

1576
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,136
No, I think
if you were gonna kill him,

1577
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,798
you would have done it by now.

1578
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,473
So, no,
I don't think you'll do it.

1579
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,273
Although, I am wondering

1580
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,554
why the fuck you think
you can intimidate me?

1581
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,833
Okay, Barbara
from Santa Barbara.

1582
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:31,920
Okay, Barbara.

1583
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,951
It is good to see you, Sergio.

1584
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,394
Been far too long.

1585
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,595
You Okay?

1586
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,830
My people will show you
to a room.

1587
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,594
Freshen up,
and then, we'll talk.

1588
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,751
God, how does my ear look?
He almost cut off my ear.

1589
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,296
Shit! We've only got
about 15 minutes, Nick.

1590
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:50,320
We've gotta go find Addy.

1591
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,471
- I know.
- According to Javi's map,

1592
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,616
they're probably holding her

1593
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,677
in the basement
of the building right here.

1594
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,360
You ready?

1595
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,360
What do we do?

1596
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:31,840
Good one.

1597
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,440
Get his gun.

1598
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,678
Drop the gun, Sergio.

1599
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,631
Neither of you
are supposed to be here.

1600
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,670
Come with me.

1601
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:58,960
Lucas.

1602
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,120
A gun?

1603
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,554
Okay, Sergio.

1604
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,274
What's the deal, my man?

1605
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,919
You got a fucking problem

1606
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,071
you'd like to
tell me about or...

1607
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,629
I was beginning to think
you don't have the girl

1608
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,918
and since our deal was based
on Delgado dropping out...

1609
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,115
- He'll drop out.
- Fuck.

1610
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,429
But he hasn't done it yet.

1611
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,720
Lucas.

1612
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,229
- Lucas!
- Now!

1613
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,040
Okay.

1614
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,280
You know,

1615
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,394
if you and I are gonna be
in business together, Sergio,

1616
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,152
you're gonna need to trust me.

1617
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,280
What the fuck?

1618
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,555
What the fuck, what?

1619
01:25:58,640 --> 01:25:59,640
Shit!

1620
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:00,880
Your face...

1621
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:02,995
- Shit!
- I'll blow

1622
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,195
his fucking head off, man!

1623
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,715
Don't fucking move!

1624
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,199
Olivia, take the girls and go.

1625
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,360
What's the plan here, Nick?

1626
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,317
You get the girls
out of here alive!

1627
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,992
No, we can't just
leave him here.

1628
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,480
Addy, go with your mom!

1629
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,560
He?! Just go. Go!

1630
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:17,880
Come on.

1631
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,634
Just run, Addy.

1632
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,193
You like that?

1633
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,233
Oh, my God.
Nick fucking Cage.

1634
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,038
Nick motherfucking Cage!

1635
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,912
Don't even think about it!

1636
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:33,794
Okay, this way.
Come on.

1637
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,400
Come on.

1638
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,360
Now, go!

1639
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:41,720
Wait!

1640
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,240
Where's Nick?

1641
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,879
He's got a gun on Lucas.

1642
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,032
He bought us some time,
but there's others.

1643
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,157
He will never make it
out of there alive.

1644
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:55,997
Here's what I know, Nick Cage.

1645
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:59,710
I've got four guys with guns
pointed directly at your head.

1646
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,759
Yeah, that's true.
But herds what I know.

1647
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,840
My family's safe.

1648
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:07,400
And that's all that matters.

1649
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,114
There he is.

1650
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,793
There he fucking is!

1651
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,638
The American hero.

1652
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:22,552
The fucking star
of Hollywood, eh?

1653
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,871
Come on.
What is this?

1654
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,192
And this nose, yeah?

1655
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:29,955
Don't fucking move!

1656
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,270
Jesus Christ!
This fucking guy again.

1657
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,360
Carlos.

1658
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,269
Carlos, please.
You don't wanna do this to me.

1659
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,993
You don't wanna do this to Javi.

1660
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,912
He's been nothing
but good to you.

1661
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:42,909
Javi is about to die.

1662
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,640
As are you.

1663
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,074
Shit!

1664
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,635
Anything you'd like to say
before you die?

1665
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:54,472
"It takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain

1666
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,800
"to send a message to the body.

1667
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,717
"So, by the time
your bullets hit me,

1668
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,793
"my cerebral cortex
will be transmittin" a signal

1669
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,672

1670
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,956
"that operate my trigger finger.

1671
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:08,997
"And before your asshole

1672
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,390

1673
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,790

1674
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,149
"And if that's the last thing
I accomplish

1675
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,038

1676
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,999
"well, then, ha, I say, ha...

1677
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:24,629
"What a way to fucking go."

1678
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,677
Shit, come on!
Nick, go! Go!

1679
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,555
Did we kill him?

1680
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,040
Shit!

1681
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:48,920
You're dead.

1682
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,239
All of you!

1683
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,153
Nicolas Cage?

1684
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,711
That's fucking cool.

1685
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,357
Addy, did he...
Did he hurt you?

1686
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,760
- Better not have.
- No.

1687
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:15,955
- Are you hungry?
- No.

1688
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,873
Javi has apples. You want
a McIntosh? Honey crisp?

1689
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:20,229
No apples, Nick.

1690
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,656
Dad, just please,
watch the road. Please!

1691
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:22,680
Shit!

1692
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,199
Shit!

1693
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,976
Olivia, hand me the guns.
They're right in there.

1694
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,149
What are you doing?

1695
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:42,920
No.

1696
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,096
Okay, stop the truck.
I will slow them down.

1697
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:45,120
- No way!
- Yes.

1698
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,496
You are two kilometers
from the embassy.

1699
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,856
If I slow them down,
then you will all make it.

1700
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,439
- Javi, I can get us there.
- No!

1701
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,272
Just stay in the truck! Javs!

1702
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:55,920
No!

1703
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,434
Just get in the car, Javi!

1704
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,776
I'm never gonna have
any kind of a life

1705
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,996
unless I stand up to my cousin!

1706
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:07,990
I need this.

1707
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,270
Now, go.

1708
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:12,680
Go!

1709
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:22,515
You stayed.

1710
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,189
Of course.

1711
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:03,200
Don't worry, Addy.
Everyone's gonna be okay.

1712
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,319
- How's Maria doing?
- She's okay.

1713
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,470
Dad, please go faster.

1714
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,640
Yeah. Take this left here.

1715
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:24,915
Shit!

1716
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,474
Hold on.

1717
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,996
Did we lose 'em?
I think we lost 'em.

1718
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:52,915
Dad, watch out!

1719
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,230
I'm gonna kill you,
Nick fucking Cage!

1720
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,713
Get down!
Everybody get down!

1721
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,555
Hold on!

1722
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,795
What just happened?

1723
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,069
Addy?

1724
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,470
- Come out!
- Gun!

1725
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:59,675
Come on!

1726
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,833
Don't you move!

1727
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,150
Get back!

1728
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,593
Come near me
and I'm gonna kill him.

1729
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:13,989
Addy?

1730
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:17,315
Dad!

1731
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,479
We made it, Nick.

1732
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,280
We made it.

1733
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,109
All of us.

1734
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,913
I love you, Daddy.

1735
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:37,676
"I love you, Daddy'?

1736
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,273
- Javi wrote that.
- Okay.

1737
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,314
Congratulations.

1738
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:42,949
Thanks, Olivia.

1739
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:47,680
We're back.

1740
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,159
Not that we went anywhere.

1741
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:50,640
Not that we went anywhere.

1742
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,273
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

1743
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,600
Nick.

1744
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:09,719
Javi, I've been looking for you.

1745
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,074
I was wondering where you went.

1746
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,878
Oh, no, I couldn't watch.
I was...

1747
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,079
I was too nervous.

1748
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,475
How did it play?

1749
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,790
They loved it.
Congratulations.

1750
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,520
- Really?
- Yeah.

1751
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,120
This is...

1752
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:25,600
Nick...

1753
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,440
Thank you.

1754
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,955
Javi, we did this together.
Thank you.

1755
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,753
Do you wanna ride to the party
with me?

1756
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,033
They want to interview us.
<i>Vanity Fair.</i>

1757
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,196
Yeah, no, I can't tonight.
But you go.

1758
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,271
Have fun. Enjoy this.

1759
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,039
And give Gabriela my love.

1760
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:51,758
Addy wants to borrow your belt.

1761
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:52,875
Yeah, I do.

1762
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,156
It looks like
ifs got some weight.

1763
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,516
Well, yeah,
ifs a big, fat tarantula.

1764
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,079
You know my dresser, Jeff.

1765
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,435
- Mr. Neiman Marcus?
- Yes.

1766
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,680
He wanted me to wear a bee.

1767
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,791
And I said, "Jeff,
not the bees. Not the bees"

1768
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,616
So, he said, “Well, how about
a scorpion?" I said,

1769
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,016
"I think a scorpion
is a little aggressive, Jeff.

1770
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,040
"What about a tarantula?"

1771
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:09,256
He goes, "Well, I don't think

1772
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,336
"that's any
less aggressive, Nick."

1773
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:11,536
And I say,
"Well, it is to me."

1774
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,834
They're cute and fuzzy, right?

1775
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,120
Well, Addy wants to borrow it.

1776
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:15,840
Not at all.

1777
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,439
You can have it.
It's yours.

1778
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,830
Are you sure you didn't need
to stay at the premiere?

1779
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:22,077
- Hundred percent.
- Yeah?

1780
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:23,560
Who chose Demi Moore
to play Mom?

1781
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:24,755
Studio.

1782
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,269
But it doesn't really do your
mother justice, does it?

1783
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,430
Oh, come on.

1784
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:29,715
She's gorgeous.

1785
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,029
So are you, Olivia.

1786
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,358
Dad, stop hitting on Mom.

1787
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,440
I'm not hitting on her.

1788
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,429
Gross. I don't wanna
listen to this anymore.

1789
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,551
You know what? What do you say
we watch a movie?

1790
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,632
Yeah, whatever you want, Dad.

1791
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,233
No, really. You choose.

1792
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:45,440
Really?

1793
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,919
Yeah, show us something
you like.

1794
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,154
This is...

1795
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,556
Have you ever seen <i>Paddington 2?</i>

1796
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:39,109
<i>You're Nick</i>

1797
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,555
<i>fucking...</i>

1798
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:49,598
<i>Cage!</i>

1799
01:37:50,305 --> 01:38:50,397
