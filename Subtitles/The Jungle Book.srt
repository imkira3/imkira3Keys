2
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,610
Many strange tales
are told of this Jungle...

3
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,653
but none so strange...

4
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,074
as the tale of the cub we call Mowgli.

5
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,898
You must be the very
worst wolf I've ever seen.

6
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,322
Yeah, but if that branch didn't break,
I would've made it.

7
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,329
Crossing upwind,
breaking from your numbers.

8
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:35,864
If you can't learn to run with the Pack...

9
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,499
one of these days,
you'll be someone's dinner.

10
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,830
- How'd we do?
- Not Mowgli, again.

11
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,541
- He's never gonna make the Council.
- Let's go!

12
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,421
Race you to the top!

13
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,757
It was higher ground.

14
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,089
Wolves don't hide in trees.

15
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,423
I can't keep up with them, Bagheera.

16
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,588
I tried. I just picked the wrong tree.

17
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,098
It was a dead tree.

18
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,596
How was I supposed to know it was dead?

19
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,885
It had a fig vine.

20
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,977
Any tree girdled by a creeper
is either dead or close to it.

21
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,143
- These are things a wolf must know.
- Yeah.

22
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,403
But if the branch didn't break,
I would've made it.

23
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,276
I realise you weren't born a wolf,
but couldn't you at least act like one?

24
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,666
When I found him, many years ago...

25
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,625
he was just an infant,
abandoned in the woods.

26
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,289
Get the deer!

27
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,584
If he was going to survive...

28
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,295
I knew he needed a people.

29
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,259
A people to protect him.

30
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,221
That's why I entrusted him to the wolves.

31
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,268
Look well, wolves.

32
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,027
Akela was a just and noble leader.

33
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,531
He allowed Mowgli to dwell
among them, all those years.

34
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,661
The trouble was, wolves grew so fast...

35
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,371
and Mowgli...

36
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,158
let's just say he liked to take his time.

37
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,496
Mowgli, pick me up high!

38
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,207
- My turn!
- Stop. Not now.

39
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,543
It was Raksha who raised him.

40
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,708
She was the only mother he ever knew

41
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,761
- Come on, let's play!
- I don't feel like playing, Gray.

42
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,967
Come on, you're my brother.
You have to play with me.

43
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,007
Let's go chase some mice.

44
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,974
How did it go?

45
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,138
Caught me again.

46
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,815
If it's meant to be...

47
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,897
it will be.

48
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,187
Let me hear the Law.

49
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:35,322
"This is the Law of the Jungle,
as old and as true as the sky.

50
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,907
"The Wolf that keeps it will prosper...

51
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,822
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die.

52
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,538
"Like the creeper that girdles
the tree trunk...

53
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,044
"the Law runneth over and back.

54
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,752
"For the strength of the Pack
is the Wolf...

55
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,384
"and the strength of the Wolf
is the Pack."

56
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,906
Soon, the rain ceased to fall

57
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,866
and the dry season arrived.

58
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,298
Heat crept through the Jungle...

59
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,252
turning it yellow, then brown...

60
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,795
then black.

61
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,682
But that year...

62
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,845
was the driest season
that anyone could remember.

63
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,183
Even the mohwa didn't flower.

64
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,069
My leaf.

65
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,652
This is mine. Mine, mine, mine.

66
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,238
There's a rock. That's mud. That's mud.

67
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,869
There's a rock. That's my rock.

68
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,700
That's my rock. Nobody touches my rock.

69
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,286
There's another rock.
Two rocks. Three rocks.

70
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,291
Peace Rock? Peace Rock!

71
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,913
It's the Truce! The Water Truce!

72
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,132
It's the Water Truce!

73
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,090
It had been many, many years

74
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,170
since the Peace Rock was revealed...

75
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,174
and the Water Truce was called.

76
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,808
Hunting at the riverbank
was now forbidden...

77
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,650
because, by Law of the Jungle,
drinking comes before eating.

78
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,907
So, you could come to the Peace Rock,
on a day like this...

79
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,160
and find all people side-by-side.

80
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,789
Don't forget.

81
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:55,920
No hunting.

82
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,000
Playing only.

83
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,593
Playing, only. I got it, ami.

84
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,805
And remember, not everyone here
has seen a man-cub in the Jungle before.

85
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,341
So, behave yourself.

86
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,392
Okay, can I go now?

87
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,768
Take the pups with you.

88
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,896
Wait for me!

89
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,605
Come on, Gray!

90
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:13,975
Oh, take a look at this guy.

91
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:15,936
Excuse me.

92
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,771
Sorry.

93
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,073
- He's walking on two legs.
- Don't stare.

94
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,483
Hey, look. A wild boar.

95
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,028
- And a rhino.
- And a mongoose.

96
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,195
Everybody's here.

97
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,664
Is that a peacock?

98
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,867
- Ooh, a stick!
- Oh, that's my stick.

99
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,501
- I like this stick.
- Seriously, that's my stick.

100
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,707
- This is my stick.
- No, that's my stick!

101
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,371
- Let go of my stick!
- It's a Water Truce!

102
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,710
It's a Water Truce!

103
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,878
Sorry.

104
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,461
My bad! It's involuntary.

105
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,591
I could pee on it.

106
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,301
Watch yourself, please.

107
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,091
Dad, what is that?

108
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,884
I think that's a man-cub.

109
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,053
What's a man-cub doing here?

110
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,231
Whoa. Don't forget the Truce.

111
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,063
I know the Law, bucks.

112
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,451
What is that?

113
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,916
- Weird.
- That's weird.

114
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,459
Mowgli.

115
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,432
What was the rule about your tricks?

116
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,593
It's not the wolf way.

117
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,433
No more tricks.

118
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,274
Chin up, little one.

119
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,026
We'll make you a fine wolf, yet.

120
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,110
What about me? Am I gonna be a fine wolf?

121
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,398
Look at me howl!

122
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,737
In some packs, the runt gets eaten.

123
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,113
Oh...

124
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,138
Mowgli, behind me.

125
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,557
Don't leave my side.

126
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:02,227
Everyone comes to Peace Rock.
So many smells to catch up on.

127
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,616
But, um...

128
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,539
I can't help but notice...

129
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,202
there's this strange odour today.

130
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,707
What is it, this scent that I'm on?

131
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,294
I almost...

132
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,555
I almost think it was some kind of...

133
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,423
man-cub.

134
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,104
Mowgli belongs to my Pack, Shere Khan.

135
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,556
Mowgli?

136
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,317
They've given it a name.

137
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,902
When was it we came to adopt
man into the Jungle?

138
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,907
He's just a cub.

139
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,363
Does my face not remind you
of what a grown man can do?

140
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:02,455
Shift your hunting ground for a few years
and everyone forgets how the Law works.

141
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,668
Well, let me remind you.

142
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,428
A man-cub becomes man...
and man is forbidden!

143
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,599
- What do you know about Law?
- Raksha.

144
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,226
Hunting for pleasure. Killing for power.

145
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,930
You've never known Law. The cub is mine!

146
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,639
Mine to me.

147
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,892
So, go back to where you came from,
you burned beast!

148
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,782
The tiger knows who rules
this part of the Jungle.

149
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,781
I'm sure he doesn't mean to come here
and make threats.

150
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,490
Especially during a Water Truce.

151
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,960
No, I'm deeply respectful of these Laws
that keep us safe.

152
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,504
So, here's my promise.

153
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,173
Nothing lasts forever.

154
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,270
The rains will return
and the river will rise.

155
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,148
And when this rock disappears,
that Truce will end.

156
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,145
You want to protect him, fine.

157
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:14,197
But ask yourselves,
how many lives is a man-cub worth?

158
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,504
How many lives?

159
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,837
Who could answer that question?

160
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,210
- The rain!
- Rain!

161
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,370
- Rain!
- The rain!

162
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,424
Keep it dry, keep it dry, keep it dry.

163
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,339
These quills get stuck on everything!

164
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:22,393
When the rains returned, it was
a question the Council had to face.

165
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:52,586
They deliberated and they argued...
for many days.

166
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,881
What do you think they're talking about?

167
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,768
No one had ever come
between the Pack before.

168
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,435
But Shere Khan's threat...

169
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,600
was not to be ignored.

170
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,403
Mowgli, you're not supposed
to go up there!

171
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,294
He's got to go.

172
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:32,997
Look at the skies.

173
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,300
Shere Khan may be heading here
as we speak.

174
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,051
Please!

175
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,552
I'm leaving.

176
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,349
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

177
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,518
Mowgli, go back to the den!

178
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,311
A man-cub belongs with man.

179
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,276
We raised him as one of our own!

180
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,104
- He'll have the boy, either way.
- Akela.

181
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,949
Maybe I can be of help.

182
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,485
The boy's right.

183
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,528
Maybe it's time he found another people.

184
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,364
- No.
- I'm the one who brought him to you.

185
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,659
And now I'll return him
to where he belongs.

186
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,117
I won't let you.

187
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,661
He's my cub!

188
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,170
We knew this day would come.

189
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,590
We are the only family he's ever known!

190
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,840
Raksha.

191
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,220
It's the only place he'll be safe.

192
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,139
It's okay, ami.

193
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,848
I won't go far.

194
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,685
I'll come back and visit.

195
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,439
Never forget this...

196
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,192
You're mine.

197
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,901
Mine to me.

198
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,156
No matter where you go,
or what they may call you...

199
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,740
you will always be...

200
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,447
my son.

201
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,869
I wish I could tell you...

202
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,577
that the wolves
could've fought Shere Khan.

203
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,580
But this is not that kind of a tale.

204
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,747
The turtles like me.

205
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,757
Maybe the crocodiles.

206
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,375
What about the rhinos?

207
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,419
They always let me hang around.

208
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,722
Of course, the rhinos sleep standing up.

209
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,267
I don't think I'd be very good at that.

210
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,724
It's either the turtles or the crocodiles.

211
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,601
Which one do you think is better?

212
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,016
Neither.

213
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,855
What do you mean?

214
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,236
I'm bringing you to the man village.

215
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,605
What?

216
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,570
Bagheera, I don't know man.

217
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,859
You will.

218
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,454
You always said we're not supposed

219
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,619
to go near a man village.

220
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,625
That was different.

221
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,377
Why is it different?

222
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,413
You always said, "Stay away
from the man village...

223
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,081
"because you might fall in a trap...

224
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,759
"or get eaten,
or get hurt by flying rocks."

225
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,590
I know what I said.

226
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,723
Whoa. Elephants.

227
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,305
- Bow your head.
- Why?

228
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,473
Show them respect.

229
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,443
The elephants created this Jungle.

230
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,980
Where they made furrows
with their tusks, the rivers ran.

231
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,898
Where they blew with
their trunks, the leaves fell.

232
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,327
They made all that belongs.

233
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,784
The mountains, the trees,
the birds in the trees.

234
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,494
But they did not make you.

235
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,247
That is why you must go.

236
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,023
What if I live with the nilgai?

237
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,107
No.

238
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,817
Or the mongoose?

239
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,531
This is not a discussion.

240
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,991
But this is my home!

241
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,538
I don't even know what man's like.

242
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,949
You'll learn.

243
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,367
But I wanna stay in the Jungle.

244
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,080
Why do I have to go there?

245
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,416
Because the Jungle
is no longer safe for you.

246
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,580
You're being hunted...

247
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,044
by a tiger.

248
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,083
Only man can protect you now.

249
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,168
Whoa!

250
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,214
This isn't fair.
You're not giving me a choice.

251
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,973
There's a lot of stuff
you're not telling me, too.

252
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,634
Don't think I didn't notice.

253
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,518
You say you're taking me
where I came from...

254
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,145
but you found me in the Jungle.

255
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,682
Are you bringing me back
to the Jungle? No.

256
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,643
Why are you bringing me to the man
village if you found me in the Jungle?

257
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,732
And why does the tiger hate me so much?

258
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,818
Does he know me?
Sure seems like he knows me.

259
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,939
Down.

260
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,826
What? Now we have to bow
to the buffalo, too?

261
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,862
Listen to me. This is not a game.

262
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,906
You're gonna run to that ravine.

263
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,908
What are you talking about?

264
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,835
Go to the north,
where the sky glows at night.

265
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,994
I'll find you on that path.

266
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,379
Bagheera, I'm not taking one
more step until you tell me...

267
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,117
Run, Mowgli!

268
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:55,945
Run!

269
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,249
Gray, what's wrong?

270
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,383
Why don't you come outside and play?

271
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,136
What is that?

272
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,097
Why did he have to leave?

273
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,260
Gray.

274
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:47,307
We could've protected him.
We shouldn't have let him go.

275
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,225
I miss him, too.

276
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,353
What's important is, he's safe now.

277
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,779
Get inside.

278
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,957
I suppose you know why I've come.

279
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,916
The man-cub has left the Jungle.

280
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,221
I thought I made myself clear.

281
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,553
I wanted him turned over to me.

282
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,473
We no longer harbour him.

283
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,309
He has left the Pack.

284
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,024
And where, may I ask, has he gone?

285
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,523
He's with his own kind now.

286
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,070
So, the man-cub has left the Jungle.

287
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,159
That's right.

288
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,912
You and I no longer have a quarrel.

289
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,997
And, most importantly...

290
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,503
we have peace.

291
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,086
I guess it's done, then.

292
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,381
Unless I can draw him...

293
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,887
back out!

294
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,851
Akela!

295
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,064
Have I got your attention now?

296
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,018
I didn't want it to be this way.

297
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,358
I made it so simple.

298
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,150
All I asked for was one thing,
and you denied me!

299
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,161
That ends now.

300
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,196
Spread the word.

301
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,121
Until I have the man-cub,
these hills are my hills.

302
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,706
You did not respond to reason!

303
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,921
So now, you will know fear.

304
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,380
Bagheera?

305
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,019
Hmm?

306
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,235
Hey, there.

307
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,366
Do you have a language?

308
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,372
You're kind of cute, I guess.

309
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,541
You want a bite?

310
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,457
Come on.

311
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,169
Come here. Come on, it's all right.

312
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,632
Don't be afraid.

313
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,681
Come on.

314
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,359
Hey, those are mine!

315
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,402
Hey, come back!

316
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,201
Those are mine!

317
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,492
Drop it!

318
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,389
Hello?

319
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,445
Who's out there?

320
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,743
Hi, little cub.

321
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,785
Oh, no. Don't be scared.

322
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,750
I'm not gonna hurt you.

323
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,915
I was just passing through.
I don't want any trouble.

324
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,083
There's no trouble.

325
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,961
Are you alone out here?

326
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,597
Mmm. That's not good.

327
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,433
We should never be alone.

328
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,428
I'm waiting for a friend.

329
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,438
He should be here soon.

330
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,979
I can stay with you, until he gets here.

331
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,278
Would that be all right?

332
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,442
I'll keep you safe.

333
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,455
Just you and me, sweet thing.

334
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,076
Who are you?

335
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,047
Kaa.

336
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,259
Poor, sweet little cub.

337
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,226
What are you doing so deep in the Jungle?

338
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,309
This is my home.

339
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,518
Don't you know what you are?

340
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,977
I know what you are.

341
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,858
I know where you came from.

342
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,444
You do?

343
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,495
Yes.

344
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,501
Would you like to see?

345
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,008
Yeah.

346
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,514
Mostly, men stay in their village...

347
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,217
far from the dark of the Jungle.

348
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,053
But sometimes...

349
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,721
they travel.

350
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,855
And when they do...

351
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,018
their caves breathe in the dark.

352
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,686
They call it...

353
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,531
the Red Flower.

354
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,409
Man's creation.

355
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,538
It brings warmth and light...

356
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,045
and destruction to all that it touches.

357
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,713
Who is that?

358
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,975
The traveller, protecting his cub.

359
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,833
Shere Khan ended
the man's life that night.

360
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:20,249
But not before he was burned
by the Red Flower's touch.

361
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:25,087
He ran so fast, he didn't
notice the cub he left behind.

362
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,148
And that cub...

363
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,433
was you.

364
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,131
The panther found you.

365
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,809
Oh, you poor, sweet thing.

366
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,279
You want to stay in the Jungle?

367
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,494
You can be with me, if you want.

368
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,657
I'll keep you close.

369
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,494
Let go of your fear, now.

370
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,540
Trust...

371
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,175
in me.

372
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:15,739
Relax, kid.

373
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,202
No need to get worked up. Okay?

374
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,334
- Where am I?
- Uh...

375
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,541
This is a cave. It's my cave.

376
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,166
You don't remember what happened, do you?

377
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,551
- No.
- I saved your life.

378
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,592
Yeah, I snatched you
from the jaws of death.

379
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,928
The coils of death, if you will.

380
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,967
And lucky for you...

381
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,227
your new favourite hero,
old Baloo, here...

382
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,730
just happened to be passing by.

383
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:41,890
Uh, no big deal.

384
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,191
Just tell me this.

385
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,940
Can you...

386
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,571
climb?

387
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,490
Yeah.

388
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,737
Then let's quit wasting time
and get on with it.

389
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,412
Get on with what?

390
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,907
Payback, kid. Payback.

391
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,035
What do you mean "payback"?
Payback for what?

392
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,247
You owe me, kid.

393
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,131
You owe me. You owe me.

394
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,291
Slow down.

395
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,214
- And you're gonna pay back.
- But, but...

396
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,469
Because that's right.

397
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,803
You're gonna do the right thing.

398
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:13,963
That's the right thing to do.

399
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,473
You're gonna pay me back,
because you owe me.

400
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:16,724
You got it?

401
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,444
Okay, here's our little task.

402
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,604
You see that golden stuff,
dripping down there?

403
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,406
That's called "honey."

404
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,446
All you need to do, little one...

405
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,076
for payback purposes...

406
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,613
is to just shimmy on up there...

407
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,328
and get me that thing up there
that's making that funny noise...

408
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,992
and bring it back down.

409
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,878
You're kidding me, right?

410
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,419
No, not really.

411
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,085
I can get killed going up there.

412
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,468
Kid!

413
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,089
Kid, kid, kid. Try to understand this.

414
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,760
I'm a bear.

415
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,472
It means that I have to eat my weight...

416
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,681
every day...

417
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,471
for hibernation purposes.

418
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:07,396
I know I'm asking for a lot,
but I don't climb and you do.

419
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,108
Look, I really need your help.
Winter's coming.

420
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,273
You don't want me to go to sleep...

421
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,283
and never wake up.

422
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,070
There are a lot of bees up here.

423
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,905
Yeah, some.

424
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,370
But don't worry. These ones don't sting.

425
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,129
Attaboy!

426
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,419
Ow! I'm getting stung!

427
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,719
Okay.

428
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,635
I would've done this myself,
but I'm afraid of heights.

429
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,269
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

430
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,763
Why don't you mind your own business?

431
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,098
You can do it!

432
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,233
- He's just gonna run away.
- Not this one.

433
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,147
As soon as the monkeys get
stung, they always run away.

434
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,396
- He's not a monkey. A man-cub.
- What is he?

435
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,690
A man-cub?
Yeah! Could you keep your voice down?

436
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,024
I'm trying to concentrate.

437
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,369
- Everything going A-okay up there?
- Ow!

438
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,913
Oh, boy. Looks like you got another one.

439
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,453
- Buzz off.
- It's a man-cub.

440
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:28,954
- A man-cub?
- Yeah, it's a man-cub.

441
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,415
- It's not a monkey?
- No, it's a man-cub!

442
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,456
You have never been
a more endangered species...

443
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,124
than you are at this moment.

444
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,501
You're doing an amazing job!

445
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,136
I'm getting stung!

446
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,925
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

447
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,806
- It's not a monkey, Fred.
- It's a man-cub.

448
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,308
- A man-cub?
- Yeah, it's a man-cub.

449
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,059
- Can you believe it?
- Are you sure?

450
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,769
Would you please shut up?

451
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,309
Hey, up there!

452
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,644
Everything is going fantastically, I see.

453
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,814
Ow!

454
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,901
You got it! Believe in yourself!

455
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,283
- There you go!
- Ow!

456
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:07,948
Come on! Almost!

457
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:09,824
Yeah!

458
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,330
Yeah!

459
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,829
Oh, yeah!

460
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,672
Uh-oh.

461
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,798
Fred?

462
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,026
Oh, yeah, exfoliate me.

463
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,273
You said they didn't sting.

464
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,316
What do you call this?

465
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,448
How the heck did you do that?

466
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,704
Oh, those must have been females!

467
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,790
They look like males from down here.

468
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,704
Females do sting.

469
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,744
Just put some honey on those.

470
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,209
- Honey? Really?
- Yeah.

471
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,457
You put it on, you lick it off.
You feel much better.

472
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,676
It's nature's ointment.

473
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,381
I put it everywhere.

474
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,174
Thanks.

475
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,558
Okay, so, we're even now!

476
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,177
Hold on a minute.

477
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,811
What's your name anyway?

478
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,810
We were never properly introduced.

479
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,896
- Mowgli.
- Mowgli?

480
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,528
Mowgli is a terrific name.

481
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,236
I bet you got that one
all to yourself, too.

482
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,899
Hey!

483
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,409
Mowgli, look...

484
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,070
I got a lot of gathering to do
these next couple of weeks...

485
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,660
on account of the hibernation.

486
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,621
I could really use your help.

487
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,080
You know, if you stuck around...

488
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,621
I can't. I have to go to the man village.

489
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,501
Uh...

490
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,127
For what reason, man village?

491
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,463
I don't have a choice.
There's a tiger hunting me.

492
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,253
Really? Why a tiger?

493
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,922
Because I'm a man-cub, all right?

494
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,427
Just leave me alone.

495
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,434
Hey! Mowgli, my friend, my buddy, my pal.

496
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,142
Slow down a second, handsome.

497
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,478
Bagheera said I have to go
to the man village.

498
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:02,779
Oh, Bagheera! I know him. Sure.

499
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,530
You know what his problem is?

500
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,862
He always plays by the rules.

501
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,993
And, sometimes rules were meant to be...

502
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,496
well, not necessarily broken,
but certainly bent.

503
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,032
And definitely reinterpreted.
Don't you think?

504
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,792
He told me to go to the man village,
so, that's where I'm gonna go!

505
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,915
Okay, fine.

506
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,621
You wanna go to the man village,
have it your way.

507
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,630
In fact, I'll do you one better.

508
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,666
I'll take you there myself.

509
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,676
Come on, let's go. It's getting late.

510
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,096
Bare necessities

511
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,177
Forget about

512
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,185
Your worries and your strife

513
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,851
I mean the bare necessities

514
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,361
What's that?

515
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,817
That's a song about the good life.

516
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,074
What's a song?

517
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,906
You never heard a song before?

518
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,946
Everyone's got a song.

519
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,739
Didn't the wolves ever sing?

520
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,123
I don't know.

521
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,617
Uh... Oh...

522
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,332
We recited the Law of the Jungle.

523
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,005
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

524
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,508
"as old and as true as the sky.

525
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,509
"The Wolf that keeps it may prosper...

526
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,387
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die."

527
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,842
Kid, that's not a song.

528
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,931
That's propaganda.

529
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,769
What's propaganda?

530
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,739
Just a little farther.

531
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,783
That's the man village?

532
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,624
Yep. You can always
tell by the Red Flower.

533
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,038
They do love their Red Flower.

534
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,131
The Red Flower doesn't seem so bad.

535
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,294
Yeah.

536
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:53,348
Let it loose, and it destroys
everything it touches.

537
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:54,507
Don't ever play with it.

538
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:55,971
You got that?

539
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,222
Yeah, I got it.

540
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,386
Good.

541
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,606
Do you think that's where I'm from?

542
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,104
Could be.

543
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,106
I don't know, kid. Does it look familiar?

544
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,566
I don't remember it.

545
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,744
All I remember is living with the wolves.

546
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,534
Why do you wanna go there?

547
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,699
Bagheera said I need a people.

548
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,668
Again, with the listening to Bagheera.

549
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,500
Hey, he's my friend, okay?

550
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,207
Now I don't even know where he is.

551
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,677
I can't believe I'm leaving
the Jungle for good.

552
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,261
May I say just one thing?

553
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,136
What I saw you do today,
I've never seen anything like it.

554
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,350
I've been trying to get
that honey for years.

555
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,981
But I used my tricks.

556
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,357
What tricks?

557
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,268
You know...

558
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,859
Everything that I built.
It's not the wolf way.

559
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:52,816
Who cares? "The wolf way."

560
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,484
That's the Mowgli way.

561
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,902
That's the Baloo way.

562
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,194
That's our way.

563
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,738
That's how we get things done.

564
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,828
I can't even imagine what kind
of potential you'd have...

565
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,159
if you had somebody like me
helping you out.

566
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,663
You say you want to go to the man village.

567
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,666
I say, you could be a man right here.

568
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,001
I'll tell you what.

569
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:13,841
Now you know where the man village is.

570
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,347
You can always go down there,
whenever you want.

571
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:20,264
But I would personally appreciate it
as a personal favour to me, personally...

572
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,145
if we just worked together,
just us, tricks and all.

573
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,475
I think it would be interesting to see...

574
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,814
just how much honey we could accumulate...

575
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,353
before winter.

576
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,942
Whatever I could do to make
your trickiness happen...

577
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,197
I will do.

578
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,156
And if it turns out to
not be fun for you...

579
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,288
I will walk you right down
to that man village myself.

580
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,405
Is that a deal?

581
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,660
Just till winter.

582
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,080
Just till winter.

583
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,348
Ami, wake up.

584
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,514
Pups?

585
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,308
They're up there.

586
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,946
The deer, of course,
take comfort in numbers.

587
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:22,079
They lack defences most animals will have.

588
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,536
And if we're being honest...

589
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,293
they're not very smart either.

590
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,208
Unlike the mother crocodile,
who is a good deal more clever.

591
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,716
But the one you have to watch out for...

592
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,381
is the cuckoo bird.

593
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,219
Do you know how the cuckoo bird survives?

594
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,559
By preying on a mother's weakness.

595
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:51,067
The cuckoo bird is too clever
to raise its young.

596
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,351
Instead, it sneaks...

597
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,480
its eggs into the nests of simpler birds.

598
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,148
So, when they hatch...

599
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,317
the mother bird is fooled.

600
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,827
She feeds them, nurtures them.

601
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,915
And do you know what happens
to her own chicks?

602
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,288
They starve...

603
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,668
and die...

604
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,295
from neglect.

605
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,958
All because a mother loved a chick...

606
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,836
that wasn't her own.

607
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,847
Come now, time for sleep.

608
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,983
I think they like me.

609
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,536
Why are you doing this?

610
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,493
He's gone.

611
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,453
Isn't that what you wanted?

612
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,494
I want him dead.

613
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,676
Once he gets word of what happened here...

614
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,211
he'll come back.

615
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,131
And I'll be waiting.

616
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,188
- That's the first mark.
- Got it.

617
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,028
- That's the first mark!
- Got it!

618
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,369
That's the first mark!

619
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,529
Got it!

620
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,367
Whoo!

621
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:14,743
Yeah, I got it!

622
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,297
- Tell him to go to the second mark!
- Got it!

623
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:22,252
- Go to the second mark!
- Got it.

624
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:24,053
Got it.

625
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,634
- Look for the
- Bare necessities

626
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,890
The simple bare necessities

627
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,474
Forget about your worries

628
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,393
And your strife

629
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,560
I mean the bare necessities

630
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,774
Old Mother Nature's recipes

631
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,739
That bring the bare necessities of life

632
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:49,158
Wherever I wander wherever I roam

633
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,664
I couldn't be fonder

634
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,908
Of my big home

635
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,326
The bees are buzzing

636
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:56,744
In the tree

637
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,213
To make some honey just for me

638
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,506
When you look under the rocks and plants

639
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,667
And take a glance at them fancy ants

640
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,586
And then maybe try a few

641
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,007
The bare necessities of life

642
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,682
They'll come to you!

643
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,352
Wherever I wander

644
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,268
Wherever I roam

645
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,932
I couldn't be fonder

646
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,100
Of my big home

647
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,520
The bees are buzzing in the tree

648
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,109
To make some honey just for me

649
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,867
When you look under the rocks and plants

650
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,402
And then take a glance at them fancy ants

651
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,786
And then maybe try a few

652
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,664
Mmm! Mmm!

653
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:36,496
The bare necessities of life
They'll come to you

654
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,374
They will come to you

655
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,790
Yeah, they'll come to you!

656
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,290
Come to you!

657
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,551
Baloo, Baloo, Baloo... look.

658
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,299
Stay low on my back.

659
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,816
Come on out and show yourself.

660
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,492
Bagheera! Ah!

661
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,069
Mowgli.

662
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,326
Oh, I was looking everywhere for you!

663
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,658
I thought you were gone!

664
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,326
- Are you all right?
- Yeah!

665
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,920
I can't believe you found me!
I was so worried about you.

666
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,665
I was lost, and I didn't know
what happened...

667
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,083
but then I met Baloo.

668
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,172
And then he saved me from a giant snake!

669
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,923
And now we're working together!

670
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,013
Really? That's a new wrinkle.

671
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,639
I didn't know sloth bears worked.

672
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,180
Come on, Mowgli, let's be on our way.

673
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,224
Wait!

674
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,440
Yeah, go on ahead. I'll catch up.

675
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,355
Don't be mad, okay?

676
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,610
Why would I be mad?

677
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,191
Because you're always mad when I do stuff.

678
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,448
You gotta promise not to be mad this time.

679
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,201
Show me, then I'll decide.

680
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,036
Come on, check it out!

681
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,033
These are vines I use on the cliff.

682
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,953
I twirl them together to make
them longer and stronger.

683
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,916
See how strong they are?

684
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,424
You wanna see the really cool part?

685
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,335
It's inside. Come on, let's go!

686
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,966
Come on!

687
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,609
It's the honey stash for winter!

688
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,155
Have you lost your mind?

689
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,153
You said you wouldn't get mad.

690
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,573
Did you listen to anything
Akela taught you?

691
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,782
There's no place...

692
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,738
in the Jungle for these...

693
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:38,906
tricks!

694
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,163
You want to do this,
you do this in the man village.

695
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,085
But I'm helping Baloo
get ready for hibernation.

696
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,455
Bears don't hibernate in a jungle.

697
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:47,919
What are you teaching him?

698
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,673
Not full hibernation, but I nap a lot.

699
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,129
Listen to me, you con artist!

700
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,264
He may not know your game, but I do.

701
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,388
- He's leaving now.
- But I don't wanna leave!

702
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,428
You don't have a choice!

703
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,187
Why don't we all just
settle down for a minute.

704
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,103
Look, it's gotten late.
Too late to travel.

705
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,017
So, why don't we all
just have a little honey...

706
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:08,602
I don't eat honey.

707
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,945
No problem. I'll eat the honey.

708
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:14,442
Let's all get a good night's sleep,
and we can talk about this in the morning.

709
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,286
Fine. But we're leaving, first thing.

710
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,085
Mowgli.

711
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,018
Where is he?

712
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,263
- In the pit.
- In the what?

713
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,765
- Is this your teaching?
- Oh, come on!

714
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,776
You know I'd never teach him
to mess around with elephants.

715
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:49,744
Hey, guys.

716
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,712
What'd I tell you? He's special.

717
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,880
I know he's special.

718
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,515
I raised him.

719
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,560
Then don't make him leave, Bagheera!

720
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:13,017
You gotta let him be what he is.

721
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,729
You don't understand. The boy's in danger.

722
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:18,394
I know, he told me.
He's being hunted by a tiger.

723
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,858
Not any tiger. Shere Khan.

724
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,357
Shere Khan's hunting him?

725
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,524
Oh.

726
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,907
But if you send him back
to the man village, they'll ruin him.

727
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,788
They'll make a man out of him.

728
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,540
We should send him back to the Wolf Pack.

729
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,243
Who's their alpha?
Akela, he can protect him.

730
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,252
Akela is dead.

731
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,207
- What?
- Shere Khan killed him.

732
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,551
He will stop at nothing
until he has this boy.

733
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:43,756
Nothing.

734
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,633
The only way we can save him...

735
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,969
is if he goes to that man village.

736
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,553
Please, Baloo.

737
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,136
You're the only one he'll listen to.

738
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,791
Hey, kid.

739
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,258
Hey.

740
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,885
That was pretty cool,
what you did back there.

741
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,881
Bagheera didn't think so.

742
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,641
Oh, no, I talked to him.
He was very impressed.

743
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:33,890
He was?

744
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,395
We both were. Yeah.

745
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:39,933
I've never seen anyone get
that close to an elephant before.

746
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:46,940
So, listen, kid.

747
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,235
I gotta talk to you about something.

748
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:50,903
What do you wanna talk about?

749
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,662
I've been thinking.

750
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:54,823
Now that your friend has shown up...

751
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,458
maybe it's time...

752
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,335
for you two to just mosey along.

753
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,007
Now it's winter...

754
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,839
and it's really time for you to go.

755
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:08,800
But I wanna stay here with you.

756
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:12,929
We're buddies, aren't we?

757
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,141
Huh? No, we were never friends.

758
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,476
I certainly never thought
of you as my friend.

759
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,812
You helped me get honey
and I don't really need you any more...

760
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,985
Do I have to spell this out?

761
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:32,407
I don't want you around any more.

762
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,716
I did it.

763
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,383
And that's about the hardest thing
I've ever done.

764
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:53,799
I know.

765
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,765
Go away.

766
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,565
Get away from me.

767
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,442
Stop it.

768
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,667
Get away from me!

769
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:07,081
Bagheera!

770
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:09,542
Mowgli!

771
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,389
Mowgli, hold on!

772
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,020
Bagheera!

773
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,112
What was that? Where are they taking him?

774
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:35,776
This way.

775
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,781
Ahh! Ah!

776
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,115
Whoa!

777
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,797
We see you! We see you!

778
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,263
Come on, jump!

779
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,722
And watch the claws.

780
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,504
Gah!

781
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:08,827
Uh...

782
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,754
I'll take it from here.

783
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,461
No, I'm coming.

784
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,337
It's doable...

785
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,719
if I don't have to go too high.

786
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,470
Good. Let's get going.

787
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,590
All right.

788
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,680
A bird. That can't be a good sign.

789
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:13,438
Baloo. Look at me. Look at nothing but me.

790
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,647
- Hmm?
- You're doing fine.

791
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,107
Just keep your eyes up high.

792
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,531
All right. I'm coming. I'm coming.

793
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:54,876
What part of the Jungle you from?

794
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,039
You, man-cub.

795
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,712
You come from the South, the North?

796
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:05,220
What part of the Jungle?

797
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,181
The South, I guess.

798
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,472
Southern Jungle, the Seeonee.

799
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,228
Beautiful, I hear.
I never been there myself.

800
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,735
So, tell me, you ever had
a taste of the pawpaw fruit...

801
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,362
down there in the Seeonee?

802
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,822
Some people call it the...
What's the word?

803
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,492
Papaya. Stolen words.

804
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,277
I say pawpaw.

805
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:32,368
Goes to the sound it makes
when it tumbles to the Jungle floor.

806
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,165
Try it.

807
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,047
Go ahead.

808
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,470
It's good.

809
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,178
You know who I am?

810
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,388
No.

811
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:01,021
I am the King of the Bandar-log.

812
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,612
Call me Louie.

813
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:16,957
I did it!

814
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,536
Well done, old chap.

815
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,882
He must be in there. Follow me.

816
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,678
No, no. We're on level ground here.

817
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,509
I'm in charge.

818
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:32,299
And I've got a plan.

819
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,895
You are a man-cub
who wants to live in the Jungle.

820
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,021
How do you know that?

821
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,473
Kid...

822
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,235
I got ears. My ears got ears.

823
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,067
You wanna live here?

824
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,652
You need a people to protect you.

825
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,817
Only I can protect you...

826
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,657
and I will, for a price.

827
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,326
I don't have anything to give you.

828
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,204
I think you do.

829
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,036
What?

830
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,463
Look around, man-cub.

831
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,124
I got everything.

832
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,043
I have plentiful food...

833
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:09,426
endless treasure...

834
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,839
command vast legions.

835
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,762
But there's one thing I don't have...

836
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,513
and that's the one thing...

837
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,052
you can give me.

838
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,564
The Red Flower.

839
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,685
I don't have that!

840
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:27,020
You're a man, aren't you?

841
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,485
That's what makes you a man.

842
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,992
You can summon the Red Flower...

843
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,949
and control it.

844
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,656
They told me not to go near
the Red Flower.

845
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:39,866
You know why they tell you that?

846
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:43,537
Because once you have it,
you rise to the top of the food chain.

847
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,547
Nothing in this Jungle can stand up...

848
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,258
to the Red Flower.

849
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:54,889
Please, I just wanna go.

850
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,804
Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub

851
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,972
I'll make a deal with you

852
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,063
What I desire is man's red fire

853
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,852
To make my dream come true

854
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,854
Now give me the secret, man-cub

855
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,695
Come on! Clue me what to do

856
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,901
Give me the power of man's Red Flower

857
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,911
So I can be like you

858
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,780
Oh, ooo-be do

859
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,620
I wanna be like you-oo-oo

860
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:25,879
I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo

861
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:31,009
You'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee

862
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:35,972
Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo

863
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,134
Now you might think
it's ridiculous that me

864
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:42,057
A Gigantopithecus, would ever dream

865
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:45,269
I'd like to team with
the likes of you, man-cub

866
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,480
But together we'd have powers

867
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:50,236
All the Jungle's treasures, ours

868
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,781
I got desire, you got the fire

869
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,441
But the dream I dream takes two

870
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,614
So, oo-oo-oo

871
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,908
I wanna be like you-oo-oo

872
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,947
I wanna use that flame

873
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,620
Just the same as you can do

874
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,377
Oh, how magnificus it would be

875
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,121
A Gigantopithecus like me

876
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,415
Could learn to do

877
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:12,793
Like you humans do-oo-oo

878
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,424
Just one thing we need...

879
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,715
to reach our full potential.

880
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,100
Bring me that Red Flower...

881
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,053
and we will rule this Jungle.

882
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,687
I will protect you.

883
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,815
And you will want for nothing, ever again.

884
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:29,934
I can't!

885
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,020
You can't or you won't?

886
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,939
I can't!

887
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,319
You will!

888
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:36,987
Excuse me!

889
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,151
Anybody?

890
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:41,946
Excuse me...

891
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,198
am I in the right monkey temple?

892
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,204
Oh, my gosh.

893
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:49,371
Is that King Louie?

894
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,877
This is so exciting.

895
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,876
The legends do you no justice, sir.

896
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:58,676
You are truly enormous.

897
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,799
In the best way.

898
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:04,765
Look at all of that flesh...

899
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,770
just squatting there...

900
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,397
on an ancient throne.

901
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:09,682
How majestic.

902
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,817
Seize him.

903
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,399
Hey, hang on.

904
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,155
Can you just hang on?

905
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:19,193
I climbed a mountain to see you,
and I'm not a climber.

906
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,360
Just to be in your presence.

907
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:24,280
For me, this is a dream come true. Oh...

908
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:26,541
Throw him off the cliff.

909
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,124
Wait, wait, wait.

910
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,708
I have no problem with that.

911
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:33,381
I don't have any problem with that.

912
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:36,088
I came up here without an invitation.

913
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,048
It was extremely presumptuous of me.

914
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:39,511
Let me interrupt myself.

915
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:40,588
I just gotta say...

916
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:43,557
you guys are so much handsomer
in person than anyone knows.

917
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,810
No one ever gets up close to you.

918
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:46,969
Why?

919
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,513
Because of the smell.

920
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:50,477
The smell is rough.

921
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,188
But it's not just, "Oh, look at me."

922
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:56,275
It's, "I got the brains."
You guys got the know-how.

923
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,402
You got the noggin.

924
01:11:58,815 --> 01:11:59,987
You came up with this stuff,
with the thumb.

925
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,743
Come on, show me.
How do you do that? I can't do that.

926
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,031
Look, I scratch, I rub, I can grab a fish.

927
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,867
But I was hoping, and you may
not be open to this at all...

928
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:11,252
but I was hoping,
and once again, it's a dream...

929
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,122
but I was hoping that I might become...

930
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,165
a Bandar-log myself.

931
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,259
Gosh, I wanna be like you.

932
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,424
I am hitching my wagon to your star.

933
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:26,725
No one leaves!

934
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,262
I can show myself out. Thanks. Bye-bye!

935
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,956
We'll try to hold them off.

936
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,990
Where you going, man-cub?

937
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,995
Stay away from me!

938
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,535
You don't have anyone now.

939
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:33,918
I'm your only hope.
I can make it real good for you here.

940
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,498
Where else you gonna go?

941
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,330
I'll go back to the Pack!

942
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,169
I'll go back to Akela!

943
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,049
Akela?

944
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,585
Oh.

945
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:43,969
You didn't hear?

946
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,840
Shere Khan killed him.

947
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,349
Must've been on account of you.

948
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:54,601
No! You're lying!

949
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,820
Don't run away...

950
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:07,034
from who you are! You hear me?

951
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:36,059
Think about it, man-cub.

952
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,856
We can rule this Jungle.

953
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:45,690
No...

954
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,025
Listen to reason.

955
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:04,626
Gotcha!

956
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,051
Mowgli!

957
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,616
If anything happens to that kid...

958
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,539
I'll never forgive myself.

959
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,451
- Bagheera!
- Mowgli?

960
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:21,744
Stay there.

961
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:23,913
We'll come around to you.

962
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,211
Is it true?

963
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,758
What?

964
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,345
Is Akela dead?

965
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:34,014
We were going to tell you.

966
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:36,467
You knew!

967
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,181
You both knew!

968
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,892
And nobody did anything about it!

969
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,352
Kid, just hold on.

970
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,192
Someone's gotta do something!

971
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,316
Mowgli!

972
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:06,868
There's no trace of him.

973
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:08,581
Where could he have gone?

974
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:24,635
Come on!

975
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:47,871
It's man.

976
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,376
He's come to the Jungle.

977
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,925
Ami, what's happening?

978
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,090
The Red Flower.

979
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:01,381
Everybody, get to the river!

980
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:17,564
Red Flower.

981
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,566
Pups, come on. Stay close.

982
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:37,125
Is that Mowgli?

983
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:41,799
Shere Khan!

984
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,716
Shere Khan!

985
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,259
I'm not afraid of you!

986
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,678
No one has to be afraid of you any more!

987
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,312
No...

988
01:20:57,895 --> 01:21:01,195
I think they're afraid
of something else now.

989
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,292
The man-cub is now a man.

990
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:23,504
Gray...

991
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:29,226
Always a proud day...

992
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,808
when they come of age.

993
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:38,648
You can fool them, but you can't fool me.

994
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:42,315
I'm the one who saw your future.

995
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:45,530
I saw what you'd become.

996
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:53,789
Come now, use the Red Flower.

997
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:56,500
Use it on me like your father did.

998
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,215
Show everyone what you really are!

999
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:12,352
I'm Mowgli of the Seeonee
and this is my home!

1000
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,688
That was the stupidest thing
you could've done.

1001
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:24,152
Now you have nothing.

1002
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:28,702
No claws, no fur, no teeth...

1003
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:31,743
And no friends.

1004
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:35,542
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

1005
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:38,045
"as old and as true as the sky."

1006
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:39,250
What is this?

1007
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,544
"The Wolf that keeps it may prosper...

1008
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,917
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die."

1009
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:45,294
You fools.

1010
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:48,385
"Like the creeper
that girdles the tree trunk...

1011
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,094
"the Law runneth over and back."

1012
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,051
Fine! Rise up, all of you!

1013
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:54,849
You want to put yourselves
between me and the man-cub?

1014
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:58,015
"...and the strength
of the Wolf is the Pack."

1015
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,067
I will have you all in my teeth!

1016
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:27,045
- No!
- Wolves, attack!

1017
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:33,258
Stay here!

1018
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,181
But I wanna fight with the wolves!

1019
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,896
- You can't fight him like a wolf.
- You're not a wolf!

1020
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,857
Fight him like a man.

1021
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:43,936
Now, go!

1022
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:46,905
Okay.

1023
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:47,981
We'll hold him off.

1024
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:38,411
It's time we put an end to this.

1025
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:39,575
No!

1026
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,184
Dead tree.

1027
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:06,870
It's just you and me now!

1028
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:05,225
Break, break!

1029
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,944
You've got nowhere to go, man-cub!

1030
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:40,532
Did you think I would let you grow old?

1031
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:51,876
Either I'll devour you
or the Red Flower will.

1032
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:55,998
It's just a matter of time.

1033
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:03,176
How long did you really think
you'd survive against me?

1034
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:07,051
Longer than your father did?

1035
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:12,181
Longer than... Akela?

1036
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,619
I'm not afraid of you!

1037
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:39,633
Do you hear me?

1038
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,344
I'm done running from you!

1039
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:16,429
You stood your ground, old boy.

1040
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,269
You stood your ground.

1041
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:34,827
Ami, ami!

1042
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:39,002
My son.

1043
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:41,170
- Mowgli!
- It's Mowgli!

1044
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,086
Mowgli.

1045
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:18,457
Will you look at that?

1046
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:31,922
And where they made furrows
in the ground with their tusks...

1047
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:34,511
there the rivers ran.

1048
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:05,338
In my years, I've seen
a lot in this Jungle.

1049
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:10,377
But that night, I saw something
I'll never forget.

1050
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,712
I saw a little boy...

1051
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:15,256
without a people...

1052
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:20,145
bring all the Jungle together
for the very first time.

1053
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:42,329
Just a few more turns.

1054
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:44,119
I'm going high!

1055
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:45,370
Stay low.

1056
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:51,588
He never listens.

1057
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:02,262
Gotcha!

1058
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:03,517
- Come on, Mowgli.
- You went in the tree.

1059
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:04,597
- That wasn't fair.
- We almost made it.

1060
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:05,974
You guys...

1061
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:09,444
are going too fast.

1062
01:34:09,602 --> 01:34:11,980
Anybody ever teach you how to jog?

1063
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:15,116
You went high when everyone else
stayed on the trail.

1064
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:17,786
- But that's what you do.
- Maybe, but I'm not a wolf.

1065
01:34:17,944 --> 01:34:19,912
Next time, stay together. Come on, guys.

1066
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:23,742
"For the strength of the Pack is the..."

1067
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:26,543
- Wolf.
- "Wolf...

1068
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:29,707
"and the strength of the Wolf
is the Pack."

1069
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:31,295
Mowgli's back!

1070
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:37,217
Hey, Mowgli! Wait for us.

1071
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:39,178
Hurry up, guys.

1072
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:40,429
Hi, Gray.

1073
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:47,141
Look well, wolves.

1074
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:56,240
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

1075
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:59,369
"as old and as true as the sky.

1076
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:02,201
"The Wolf that keeps it may prosper...

1077
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:05,287
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die.

1078
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:08,294
"Like the creeper that girdles
the tree trunk...

1079
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:10,709
"the Law runneth over and back.

1080
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:12,715
"For the strength of the Pack..."

1081
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,212
This is nice up here.

1082
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,257
Now he can climb.

1083
01:35:23,176 --> 01:35:26,396
Please don't tell me
you're about to head down.

1084
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:37,106
I could get used to this.

1085
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:38,634
Now I'm the king of the swingers

1086
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,883
Oh, the jungle VIP

1087
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,719
I've reached the top and had to stop

1088
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:45,721
And that's what's botherin' me

1089
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:47,969
I wanna be a man, man-cub

1090
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:50,184
And stroll right into town

1091
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:52,732
And be just like the other men

1092
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:54,647
I'm tired of monkeyin' around

1093
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:56,478
Oh, ooo-be do

1094
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:59,314
I wanna be like you-oo-oo

1095
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:03,402
I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo

1096
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:08,498
You'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee

1097
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:13,249
Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo

1098
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:15,922
Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub

1099
01:37:15,997 --> 01:37:17,590
I'll make a deal with you

1100
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:20,423
What I desire is man's red fire

1101
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:22,420
To make my dream come true

1102
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:24,673
Now give me the secret, man-cub

1103
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,758
Come on! Clue me what to do

1104
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,598
Give me the power of man's Red Flower

1105
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:31,270
So I can be like you

1106
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:33,102
Oh, ooo-be do

1107
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:36,108
I wanna be like you-oo-oo

1108
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:40,280
I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo

1109
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:45,111
You'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee

1110
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:49,577
Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo

1111
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:29,996
Now you might think
it's ridiculous that me

1112
01:38:30,113 --> 01:38:32,832
A Gigantopithecus, would ever dream

1113
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,911
I'd like to team with
the likes of you, man-cub

1114
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:38,250
But together we'd have powers

1115
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:40,627
All the Jungle's treasures, ours

1116
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:41,837
I got desire

1117
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:42,925
You got the fire

1118
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,798
But the dream I dream takes two

1119
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:46,679
So, oo-oo-oo

1120
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:49,387
I wanna be like you-oo-oo

1121
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:51,134
I wanna use that flame

1122
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:53,720
Just the same as you can do

1123
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:56,189
Oh, how magnificus it would be

1124
01:38:56,347 --> 01:38:58,566
A Gigantopithecus like me

1125
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:00,185
Could learn to do

1126
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:03,313
Like you humans do-oo-oo

1127
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:07,697
Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo

1128
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:12,706
Can learn to be like someone like me-ee-ee

1129
01:39:22,915 --> 01:39:27,170
Trust in me

1130
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:31,391
Just in me

1131
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:36,267
Shut your eyes

1132
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:41,105
Trust in me

1133
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:45,238
You can sleep

1134
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:50,364
Safe and sound

1135
01:39:50,443 --> 01:39:57,452
Knowing I am around

1136
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:04,708
Slip into silent slumber

1137
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:09,755
Sail on a silver mist

1138
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:12,970
Slowly and surely your senses

1139
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:17,937
Will cease to resist

1140
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:22,396
Just relax

1141
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:27,273
Be at rest

1142
01:40:27,438 --> 01:40:31,443
Like a bird

1143
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:35,781
In a nest

1144
01:40:36,489 --> 01:40:40,915
Trust in me

1145
01:40:41,077 --> 01:40:45,127
Just in me

1146
01:40:45,665 --> 01:40:49,761
Shut your eyes

1147
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:53,966
And trust in me

1148
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:16,614
Trust in me

1149
01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:21,159
Just in me

1150
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:26,164
Shut your eyes

1151
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:31,216
And trust in me

1152
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,993
Yeah

1153
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:07,706
Look for the bare necessities

1154
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:11,049
The simple bare necessities

1155
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,094
Forget about your worries

1156
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:15,679
And your strife

1157
01:42:16,922 --> 01:42:21,052
I mean the bare necessities

1158
01:42:21,218 --> 01:42:24,688
Old Mother Nature's recipes

1159
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:29,019
That bring the bare necessities of life

1160
01:42:30,353 --> 01:42:35,905
Wherever I wander, wherever I roam

1161
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:40,329
I couldn't be fonder

1162
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:42,782
Of my big home

1163
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:45,539
The bees are buzzing

1164
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:47,336
In the tree

1165
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:50,585
To make some honey just for me

1166
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:54,760
When you look under the rocks and plants

1167
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:57,923
And take a glance at them fancy ants

1168
01:42:58,130 --> 01:43:00,349
And then maybe try a few

1169
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:03,936
The bare necessities of life

1170
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:06,518
They'll come to you!

1171
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:11,565
Look for the bare necessities

1172
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:14,614
The simple bare necessities

1173
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:17,283
Forget about your worries

1174
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:18,951
And your strife

1175
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:24,453
I mean the bare necessities

1176
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:27,831
That's why a bear can rest at ease

1177
01:43:27,993 --> 01:43:32,294
With just the bare necessities of life

1178
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:36,047
So just relax

1179
01:43:37,128 --> 01:43:39,301
In my backyard

1180
01:43:40,297 --> 01:43:42,971
If you act like that bee acts

1181
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:46,562
You're working too hard

1182
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:50,228
Don't spend your time just looking around

1183
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:54,646
For something you want that can't be found

1184
01:43:54,854 --> 01:43:58,199
When you find out you can live without it

1185
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:01,569
And go along not thinking about it

1186
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:03,821
I'll tell you something true

1187
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:07,037
The bare necessities of life

1188
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:10,746
The bare necessities of life

1189
01:44:11,412 --> 01:44:13,039
Will come to you

1190
01:44:14,832 --> 01:44:18,837
Water, air, love

1191
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:26,060
House with a roof above

1192
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:31,524
Talking 'bout the bare necessities of life

1193
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:35,194
Wisdom, understanding, sleep

1194
01:44:37,855 --> 01:44:41,951
Good health is something you must keep

1195
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:47,244
Forget about your worries and your strife

1196
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:53,876
These are the bare necessities of life

1197
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:17,566
Yeah

1198
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:22,575
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1198
01:45:23,305 --> 01:46:23,832
