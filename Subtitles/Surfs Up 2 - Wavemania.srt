1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,574
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:41,554
Welcome back to SPEN Sports...

3
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:45,527
...for another episode of
Are They Still Cool? Surf Edition.

4
00:00:47,063 --> 00:00:49,965
Cody Maverick was set
to become the biggest surfer...

5
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,432
...to come out of Pen Gu
since Big Z Topanga.

6
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:58,803
He shocked and awed fans and critics
alike with his fresh, new-school moves.

7
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:02,103
He scorched nine-time champion
and local bully...

8
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:05,646
...Tank "The Shredder" Evans
and was perfectly positioned...

9
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:09,480
...to win the tenth annual
Big Z Memorial Surf-Off..

10
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:13,848
I'm doing great, man. I think
I earned a lot of respect out there.

11
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:16,616
After I win today,
you're gonna see a lot more from me.

12
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:19,956
I promise. I'm going to the Outer Banks
to surf with the Hang 5...

13
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,688
...the best in the business.

14
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:26,769
It's been my dream since I was a little kid
and it's finally about to come true.

15
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:31,171
Victory, fame and fortune
were all but guaranteed for young Cody.

16
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:35,208
Until at the last minute, he chose
to protect his friend Chicken Joe...

17
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:39,815
...from sore loser Tank Evans,
and gave up any chance of the trophy.

18
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:42,315
Chicken Joe took home
first place that day...

19
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:46,115
...and has since gained great fame
in the world of professional surfing.

20
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,224
Maverick, however,
has been all but forgotten.

21
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:51,826
Let's see what he's been up to
in this episode of...

22
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:55,329
...Are They Still Cool? Surf Edition.

23
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:29,597
So, Cody, why don't you fill us in...

24
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:31,733
...on what you've done
the last few years?

25
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,165
First, I have a question for you.

26
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:36,566
I, uh... Okay, go ahead.

27
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,334
Have you or someone you care about
expressed the urge...

28
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:40,806
...to ride waves like a pro?

29
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:43,207
- To be the master of the ocean?
- Come again?

30
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,508
Well, I can show you how it's done
at the Pen Gu Surf Academy.

31
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:51,176
At PSA, we got all the newest,
sickest moves at the lowest prices.

32
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:53,844
You want backflips? You got it.

33
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:56,584
Tail rides? You got it.

34
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,456
Tube slides? Wah-ha!
You bet you got it.

35
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:02,392
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.
We're trying to do a show here.

36
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:04,623
You can't just plug your surf school.

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,634
Hi, I'm Lani,
lifeguard and co-founder of PSA...

38
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:12,137
...where we're all about having fun
and being safe.

39
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:17,267
Mention this commercial and get
30 percent off your first lesson free!

40
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:19,436
Free, free, free, free.

41
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,549
Don't waste your money on those losers.

42
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:22,706
Oh, what now?

43
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:25,046
You should learn to surf
from a real master.

44
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,689
- Right, gang?
- Yes, sensei.

45
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,620
Hi. I'm nine-time champion
Tank Evans...

46
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,488
...and I want you
to discover your surf success story...

47
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:35,720
...at Tank's Online Surf institute.

48
00:03:35,897 --> 00:03:38,731
Just send me your
parents' credit card information.

49
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:39,925
Cut it out, Tank.

50
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:42,969
- We're trying to film a commercial here.
- No, we're not.

51
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:46,199
How can you promise these squirts
you'll turn them into winners...

52
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:49,936
...when you've never won anything
in your life? Look at all my trophies.

53
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:52,612
Each more spectacular than the last.

54
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,273
Tank, my arms are getting tired.

55
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:59,147
Fight through the pain.
It's part of your training.

56
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,913
Wanna learn how to shred for real?

57
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,924
Sign up now at TOSI and receive
a free participation trophy with purchase.

58
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:08,757
Absolutely free. With purchase.

59
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,330
Tank, get out of here.

60
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:13,365
I'll also teach you about teamwork...

61
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:16,764
...and proper surf etiquette!

62
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:18,800
- Okay, cut.
- Wait, stop.

63
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:21,737
- I am so getting fired for this.
- Stop.

64
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:23,471
- Come on.
- Ha, ha, ha.

65
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:25,043
Whoa, hey, wait. Hold on.

66
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:27,614
I wanna tell you about
my franchising opportunities.

67
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:29,114
With purchase!

68
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:31,053
Ugh!

69
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,358
Cody?

70
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:43,788
Cody?

71
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:45,991
Wake up, bro.

72
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:48,293
It's me.

73
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:50,465
- Cock-a-doodle-dude!
- Ah!

74
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:52,066
Chicken Joe.

75
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:57,309
Or as my Spanish friends call me,
El Pollo Loco.

76
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,077
What made you
come back to Pen Gu island?

77
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:04,978
You know, I haven't seen my buddies
Cody and Lani in like two years.

78
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:07,814
And I finally got some time off
from my world tour...

79
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:10,822
...so I thought I'd stop by and hang out.

80
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:12,550
Time off from your tour?

81
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:16,027
Aren't you supposed to be
in Madagascar right now?

82
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,528
Oh, man. I gotta text my manager.

83
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,101
Oh, wait.

84
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:29,868
This is just a regular clam.

85
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:32,867
Oh, I missed you, bro.

86
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:36,277
Look at you, man.
Bigtime pro surfer now.

87
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,747
I dig that wetsuit.

88
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:40,250
Yeah? Thanks.

89
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:43,083
It's a little tight around
my nuggets and tenders.

90
00:05:45,393 --> 00:05:49,191
But, my sponsors
like me to wear it, so...

91
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:51,226
Dude, you have sponsors?

92
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:52,420
Totally.

93
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:56,558
They like to give me tons of free stuff.
Boards, wetsuits, wax.

94
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,365
It's kind of a sweet deal.

95
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,474
Yeah, it sounds pretty rad.

96
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:02,799
Oh, it is, bro.

97
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:04,637
And I owe it all to you.

98
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:08,146
If you hadn't saved my life
and let me win the Big Z Memorial...

99
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,407
...I'd never be where I am today.

100
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:14,384
Heck, you'd probably be the one
with all the sponsors and endorsements.

101
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:17,818
Surfing on the tour,
being on TV, screaming fans...

102
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,458
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. I get it.

103
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:23,596
I'm happy for you, Joe. You deserve it.

104
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:28,466
Hey, Cody. I picked this up for you
while I was on tour.

105
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:29,761
Oh, thanks, Joe.

106
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:33,335
I know how much you like
these super buff penguins.

107
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:35,599
Wow, the Hang 5.

108
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:38,504
Those guys rule.
Did you surf with them or something?

109
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:40,441
Nah. I just missed them.

110
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:43,314
You know those guys,
always traveling the world...

111
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:46,146
...looking for the next
mondo extreme challenge.

112
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,149
Too crazy for me.

113
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,617
- Chicken Joe?
- Chicken Joe!

114
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:53,417
- Penguin Lani!
- It's so good to see you.

115
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:58,830
Chicken Joe,
can you teach us your moves?

116
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,466
You're the "awesome-est"!

117
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,361
Yeah, we wanna learn from you.

118
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:05,834
Can you give us
a celebrity guest surf lesson?

119
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:09,166
Yeah, I'd be happy to.
Let's get started right now.

120
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:12,505
Find me some tacos.

121
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:16,345
The Hang 5.

122
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,527
Excuse me. Hey, I'm trying to see.

123
00:07:33,698 --> 00:07:35,690
- Come on, buddy.
- Cody Maverick.

124
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:40,167
I am not spending my whole
entire vacation chasing after you.

125
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:44,867
Mom, it's the Hang 5.
I've gotta be in the front. Wow.

126
00:07:50,748 --> 00:07:53,217
Ladies and gentle penguins...

127
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:56,320
...it's the moment
you've all been waiting for.

128
00:07:56,488 --> 00:08:01,824
Behold the most extreme team,
surfing the earth and living the dream.

129
00:08:01,994 --> 00:08:05,087
Coming to you live in overdrive.

130
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:09,097
Put them together for the Hang 5.

131
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:12,234
Yeah! Hang 5! Hang 5! Hang 5!

132
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:16,373
He's the big kahuna,
the leader of the crew-a.

133
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,771
The mammal with a plan...

134
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:21,376
...Mr. McMahon.

135
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:22,670
Yeah!

136
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:27,341
The king of the big-wave riders,
only 50 footers or higher.

137
00:08:27,518 --> 00:08:30,886
To him they're just ripples,
because the H is tripled.

138
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:32,521
Introducing...

139
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:34,884
...Hunter.

140
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:36,920
Look, it's Paige!

141
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:40,223
She's the best
trick surfer on the world stage.

142
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:42,799
Her skill and audacity
cannot be gauged.

143
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:45,697
She's beautiful, fearless
and full of rage.

144
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,962
Let's give it up
for the one and only...

145
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:49,799
...Paige.

146
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:52,373
He's the Hang 5's enforcer.

147
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:56,479
Even sharks and orcas meet their maker
when they go up against...

148
00:08:56,648 --> 00:08:59,242
- ...the Undertaker.
- I'm Undertaker!

149
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:04,217
He's hardcore times four.
He lives fast, surfs hard.

150
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:08,119
No regrets.
Don't call him crazy, call him...

151
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:10,954
...J.C.

152
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:15,232
If you want some, come get some.

153
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:22,605
Wow!

154
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:30,578
Why the long face?

155
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:33,647
No, I was just remembering
the time I met the Hang 5.

156
00:09:33,816 --> 00:09:37,981
I worshiped those guys. Seeing them surf
made me who I am today.

157
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:41,817
I worked hard my whole life
so I could be just like them one day.

158
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:45,919
And somehow it just...
It just never happened for me.

159
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:47,824
I mean, I love teaching the kids...

160
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:50,364
...but I didn't think
that's all I'd be doing now.

161
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:52,791
I always thought
I was meant to be somebody.

162
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:56,427
Doing big things, inspiring people.

163
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:00,202
I guess I was wrong.

164
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,340
Does this have something to do with
all that stuff Tank said on the beach?

165
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:08,779
Cody, you can't let that guy
mess with your head.

166
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:11,887
He might have all those trophies...

167
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,818
...but he's still a loser.

168
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:17,722
Yeah, Tank is pretty annoying.

169
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:21,294
- But it's not just that.
- It's not that hard.

170
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:25,298
The secret to good surfing
is you just gotta feel the groove.

171
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,467
Chicken Joe?

172
00:10:28,638 --> 00:10:31,130
Oh, I get it.

173
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:33,207
Well, don't get me wrong.
I love the guy.

174
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:35,037
He deserves everything he's got.

175
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:39,739
But I can't help but think, man,
that could have been me, you know?

176
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:44,751
Famous, successful,
a winner that everyone respects.

177
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:48,683
I mean, look at him.
He's even a better teacher than me.

178
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:52,821
Guys, I have officially lost control
of the situation.

179
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:54,827
Cody? Lani?

180
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:57,996
Okay, maybe not a better teacher.

181
00:10:58,168 --> 00:10:59,429
We're coming, buddy.

182
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:03,364
What can I say? Pen Gu's home.

183
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:04,694
I love my life here.

184
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,074
I'd like to travel
and see the world someday.

185
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:11,771
But right now,
I got the surf school, my lifeguard job...

186
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:14,007
...and big waves all year
to keep me busy.

187
00:11:14,184 --> 00:11:16,175
It doesn't get any better than that.

188
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:20,652
Man, this teaching thing
is harder than I thought.

189
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:34,532
You know what I dig most
about Pen Gu?

190
00:11:34,702 --> 00:11:36,192
What?

191
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,708
Nothing ever happens here.

192
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,208
Chicken and penguin!

193
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,780
Never mind. Something is happening.

194
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:50,941
Wait. I've seen that seagull
somewhere before.

195
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:55,247
Prepare yourselves. It's the moment
you've all been waiting for.

196
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,222
The Hang 5! They're here.

197
00:11:58,427 --> 00:11:59,485
The Hang 5?

198
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:01,924
The most legendary surf crew
of all time?

199
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,791
- Yes!
- Woo-hoo!

200
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,099
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, great.

201
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,963
Way to ruin the surprise, kid.

202
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:10,968
That was supposed to be my line.

203
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:14,235
You can still say it.

204
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,344
You know what? Forget it.

205
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:19,445
There used to be respect
for showmanship in this business.

206
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,913
Wait a minute.
I'm the resident Hang 5 expert here.

207
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:26,452
If they were coming,
trust me, I'd know about it.

208
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,283
Hey, Hang 5.

209
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:40,461
What's up, little dudes?

210
00:12:42,537 --> 00:12:44,369
You... It's...

211
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:45,831
Oh, my gosh. My gosh.

212
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:50,471
We get crazed fans all the time.
But it's like I always say:

213
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,704
A brave man builds his house
on an ocean of milk.

214
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,974
That doesn't make a lick of sense.

215
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:00,484
It doesn't have to. I'm the boss,
and I like milk and fish.

216
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,316
Because I'm an otter,
and otters like fish.

217
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,516
I just wish you could milk a fish.

218
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:12,664
I don't really know
what to say about that.

219
00:13:13,368 --> 00:13:16,235
Hey, bro. You know where
we can get something to eat?

220
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:18,063
Uh, yeah, yeah. Food, right.

221
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:21,639
You guys eat food because you're
the Hang 5. What about squid on a stick?

222
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,310
Squids? On sticks?

223
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:26,776
I love impaled food.

224
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:29,040
Oh, yeah, I'll try anything.

225
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:31,912
Oh, yeah?
Well, I've tried everything, twice.

226
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:37,021
Whatever gnarly stuff you can eat,
I can eat twice as much, twice as fast.

227
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:40,887
Jeez, Hunter. Why do you always
have to be so competitive?

228
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:44,222
You know what? You should come over
to my place for a backyard luau.

229
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:46,924
Come on. Come on.
I won't take no for an answer.

230
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:50,866
- So you should just come.
- Yeah, man. Bring it on. I'm starving.

231
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:53,198
Tell me more about these squid sticks.

232
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:54,772
Hey, look at me, Hang 5.

233
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:57,343
Whoa, hold on there. Be careful.

234
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,173
I know all your moves. Like this.
Unh!

235
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:04,043
Help! Lani! Help! Help!

236
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:05,706
Oh, no. Arnold!

237
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:09,354
- Kid!
- Hang on, Arnold. I'm coming! Hyah!

238
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,218
Hold on.

239
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,090
Whoa! Who's that?

240
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:21,132
Oh, that's just Arnold.
This happens all the time.

241
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:23,097
Lani's on it.

242
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:28,406
Arnold, you know what I said
about going into the ocean by yourself.

243
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:31,703
I know.
Thanks for having my back out there.

244
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:33,138
Oh, ha, ha, ha!

245
00:14:33,346 --> 00:14:35,541
Whoa! You all right, little dude?

246
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:38,809
Yeah. I was just trying
to show you my mad skills.

247
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:42,786
Heh, heh. You shouldn't try to imitate us.
We're trained professionals.

248
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:45,287
Some of us with huge muscles.

249
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:49,986
I'm not gonna say who.
That would be bragging.

250
00:14:51,964 --> 00:14:53,056
Nice moves.

251
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:56,497
Oh, thanks. You must be the Hang 5.

252
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,797
Guess that explains the whale.

253
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,798
Oops! I forgot to lock it.

254
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:04,575
Hey, Lani. Guess what.

255
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:07,610
I'm throwing a luau
for the Hang 5 at my place.

256
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:10,112
Oh, yes. Let's luau!

257
00:15:10,282 --> 00:15:13,185
- All right!
- Yeah!

258
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,523
Yes. Come on, Hunter.

259
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:22,625
Whoo!

260
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:26,829
Hang 5 is the real deal.
They've done everything.

261
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:29,661
Snowboard during an avalanche, check.

262
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:32,462
Skydive into a tornado, check.

263
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:34,832
Competitive speed knitting, check.

264
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,134
Whatever it is they're about to do,
I wanna be a part of it.

265
00:15:38,343 --> 00:15:39,970
T ell us a story, J.C.

266
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,669
T ell us a scary one.

267
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:42,973
Yeah! Yeah!

268
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:47,148
All right. This happened
while I was on tour last year.

269
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,219
We were surfing the infamous
ghost beach of Levesque...

270
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:53,414
...where they say
even the waves are haunted.

271
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,217
Wh... Were you scared?

272
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,454
Not at first. But it was quiet. Too quiet.

273
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:01,565
- Then this ghost wave grabs my board!
- Ah!

274
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:03,924
And then what happened?

275
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:05,329
So there I am underwater...

276
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:08,336
He was held down
by almost 5000 psi of pressure.

277
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:11,499
I read about it in your interview
with Rolling Waves magazine.

278
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:13,577
- Escargot-go?
- Uh...

279
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:15,144
No, thanks.

280
00:16:15,313 --> 00:16:16,747
I woke up on the ocean floor...

281
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:19,211
I've practiced
your breathing technique for years.

282
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:21,442
I can hold my breath
for almost five minutes.

283
00:16:21,618 --> 00:16:23,143
I'm trying to tell my story, bro.

284
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:25,949
Can I show you my variation
on your five flipper shuffle?

285
00:16:26,124 --> 00:16:28,593
Go check on the Undertaker.
He's always hungry.

286
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:30,092
Yes, sir.

287
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:33,855
All right.
So there I was, 200 feet underwater...

288
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:35,522
...and I'm freaking out.

289
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:39,533
Did you do a controlled emergency
ascent to protect your lungs?

290
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:41,103
Uh, yeah.

291
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:44,704
- How did you know about that?
- Cody taught us that at our surf school.

292
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:49,003
That guy?

293
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:50,338
Um...

294
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:52,042
Interesting.

295
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:56,347
If you kids think J.C.'s dumb old stories
are cool, watch me uproot this tree.

296
00:16:57,756 --> 00:16:59,088
Unh!

297
00:17:01,526 --> 00:17:04,288
Anyways, wanna hear
about the time I fought off a shark...

298
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,088
...with nothing but my camo shorts?

299
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:07,287
Yeah!

300
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:10,890
Mr. Undertaker,
do you wanna try some of the...?

301
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:15,872
- More.
- Coming right up.

302
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,975
Hey, have you seen my friend Cod...

303
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:21,441
Whoa, man, don't eat me.
I'm not the food.

304
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:24,706
Can you at least
lay an egg or something?

305
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:30,610
Scary? Yeah, I get that sometimes.

306
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:33,551
They say it's because
I don't smile or talk a lot.

307
00:17:33,723 --> 00:17:36,625
- But I'm just shy. Okay?
- Ah!

308
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:38,394
Oh...

309
00:17:40,464 --> 00:17:42,456
Little of this, little of that.

310
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:44,658
All right, add some spice.

311
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:48,328
Oh, yeah. Prepping that squid.

312
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:52,738
Would you like coconut water?

313
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:56,971
- That depends. I prefer fish milk.
- Uh...

314
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:59,581
All right,
then I'll drink your coconut water.

315
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:04,777
But you better believe I'm gonna pretend
I'm sucking it from a fish's udder.

316
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:07,821
You know, Mr. McMahon,
I do a little surfing myself.

317
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,753
Cool, cool.

318
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:11,359
It is cool. And you know what?

319
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:14,690
I got some ideas for some tricks
that could really change things up.

320
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:16,958
I'm talking next-level stuff, man.

321
00:18:17,134 --> 00:18:19,033
Oh, yeah? You'll have to
show me sometime.

322
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:21,261
Really? Let's set a time.
How about tomorrow?

323
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:24,930
Excuse me a second.
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

324
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:31,273
What I hold here
is the key that will unlock...

325
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:35,109
...one of the greatest mysteries
of our time.

326
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:38,285
Why everything seems to taste like me?

327
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:39,476
No.

328
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:43,615
This is a map to the most legendary
surfing spot on the planet.

329
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:47,390
The Trenches.

330
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:52,827
I thought that the Trenches were
just, like, made up to scare little kids.

331
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:58,235
Oh, it's real, all right.
And everything you hear about it is true.

332
00:18:58,474 --> 00:19:01,137
It's hidden somewhere
on Slaughter island...

333
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:05,177
...the most dangerous
and mysterious place on the planet.

334
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,815
Jagged rocks, huge cliffs.

335
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:10,178
It's a surfer's graveyard.

336
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:12,981
And we're going to ride it! RTL!

337
00:19:13,156 --> 00:19:14,145
Am I right, guys?

338
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:16,052
Heck yeah. RTL!

339
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:17,851
RTL!

340
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:21,253
Hey, Joe. What does RTL mean?

341
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:25,599
I don't know, man. Rumbly tummy...

342
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:29,197
...something.

343
00:19:30,774 --> 00:19:34,333
Oh, I shouldn't have eaten
all those escargot-gos.

344
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:37,534
Surfing the Trenches
will be the greatest ride of my life.

345
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:39,708
And my last.

346
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:41,382
Because you're gonna die?

347
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:45,918
- No. Because I'm retiring.
- What?

348
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,386
Boss, you can't be serious.

349
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:53,287
Hey, I'm not getting any younger.
It's time for me to settle down.

350
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:56,590
What does that mean? We're
gonna be the Hang 4 from now on?

351
00:19:56,766 --> 00:20:00,963
Maybe not. Big Z always said
Pen Gu breeds great surfers.

352
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:02,934
I think it's time we add a new member.

353
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:05,162
Have somebody in mind, boss?

354
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,436
Ha, ha. I'm not gonna give away
the surprise just yet.

355
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:13,480
But I think I might have found
someone very special.

356
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,841
Yes!

357
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:21,012
How totally awesome is this, bro?

358
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:22,586
I'm gonna join the Hang 5.

359
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:25,282
Can you even imagine
what that would be like?

360
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,156
Yeah, that sounds pretty rad.

361
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:33,098
But, um, are you sure Mr. McMahon
was talking about you, bro?

362
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:36,870
What? Who else could it be, man?
He looked right at me.

363
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,437
Hey, Cody. You up?

364
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:40,869
Yeah. Hey, what's up, Lani?

365
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,978
Hey. So, uh, you got a second?

366
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:45,510
I need to tell you something.

367
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,841
Sure. I was talking about
how great it'd be...

368
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:49,744
...if the Hang 5 asked me to join.

369
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,683
Oh, um, okay.
You think they might ask you?

370
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:58,017
Well, yeah. I mean, why not?
I've been following them my whole life.

371
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:59,954
And I'm the best surfer on Pen Gu.

372
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,686
Who else are they gonna ask?

373
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:04,126
Hey, Lani. I told my mom...

374
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:07,529
...that you told me
that you were going to join the Hang 5.

375
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,795
And then she said
that I should get your autograph...

376
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:13,701
...because she wants to sell it online.

377
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:14,864
What?

378
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:18,240
Whoa! That's awesome, Lani.

379
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:23,543
Cody, your imaginary friends
are gonna be so disappointed.

380
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:27,385
So I guess they asked you.

381
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:31,718
Yeah. Mr. McMahon and Paige
came over to my place this morning.

382
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:34,017
They said I showed moxie
saving Arnold...

383
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,991
...and they could use somebody
with my lifeguard skills.

384
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:40,099
They're waiting for me
on the South Shore.

385
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,996
But I don't know, Cody.
This is your dream.

386
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,231
No. No, no... No way.
You can't pass this up, Lani.

387
00:21:46,441 --> 00:21:49,169
It's the Hang 5, all right? You gotta go.

388
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:52,176
- I'll figure something out. Don't worry.
- Wait, really?

389
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,005
Will you be okay? I don't want to...

390
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,877
Go tell them you're coming
before they change their minds.

391
00:21:57,051 --> 00:22:00,418
- I'll see you there.
- Okay, okay. Bye!

392
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:04,579
Does that mean you're not leaving
Pen Gu and joining the Hang 5...

393
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:09,558
...and fulfilling your ultimate destiny
of becoming a legendary surfer?

394
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,322
No, I got an idea.

395
00:22:11,532 --> 00:22:14,399
Come on, you guys.
I'll explain on the way.

396
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:19,030
Hang 5! Prepare for boarding.

397
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,536
Don't be nervous.
You're gonna do great.

398
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,732
- I have a good feeling about you.
- Ha-ha.

399
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,035
- Thanks.
- Is that them?

400
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,612
Yeah, come on. Get over there.

401
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:29,339
- Uh!
- Ah!

402
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:32,380
Do what Cody taught us.

403
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:34,417
Um... Ah...

404
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:37,215
Look. Who's that in the water?

405
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,223
It must be Cody Maverick...

406
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:44,227
...Pen Gu's favorite surfer.

407
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:49,366
Did you say Cody Maverick?
Let's go watch him.

408
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,595
- Yeah! Let's go see Cody!
- Yeah!

409
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:55,502
So have you done
a lot of acting before?

410
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:59,305
Um, yes. I'm more of a Method actor.

411
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,177
And I think Arnold comes
from a Broadway background.

412
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:06,748
# I am the very model
Of a modern major general #

413
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:07,976
# I've information... # #

414
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,622
Here we go. Showtime.

415
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,530
Whoa! All right!

416
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:29,438
Sick.

417
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,101
Whoo!

418
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,473
Kid's got style.

419
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,682
Nice moves, kid.

420
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,719
Yo, Mr. McMahon,
what about we bring Cody too?

421
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,355
Let's see what else he's got.

422
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:47,788
What? We already said
we were bringing my girl Lani.

423
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,823
I wanna bring the chicken.

424
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:52,189
In case I get hungry.

425
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,058
That's cool. I gotta warn you, though...

426
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,359
...I'm not a great cook.

427
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,731
- All right, all right, all right.
- Not so fast.

428
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,803
Tank is the one you want.

429
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,305
I heard you're looking for
a champion to join you.

430
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:05,306
So I brought my resume.

431
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,147
I like your style.
Reminds me of myself at a younger age.

432
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,681
Well, thanks. But, you know...

433
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,978
...I'm not as handsome as you are, sir.

434
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,850
Ha. Of course not. Oops!

435
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,454
Oh, Briana!

436
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:22,525
- Sorry about that.
- Oh, that's good.

437
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:26,858
You better take that. Who made
this thing? My trophies never broke.

438
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,524
- Oh! Again.
- Ridiculous. That thing's garbage.

439
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,692
- Take it. Take the whole thing back.
- Funny.

440
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,737
Well, now I have more of her,
so thanks.

441
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:40,036
This is my guy. Everybody else
has a guy. I want a guy.

442
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,735
Oh, for crying out loud.

443
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,881
Fine. You can keep your rookies.

444
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,541
- Yes! Up top! Headbutt!
- Yes! Ooh!

445
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,550
- Awesome.
- Yeah, I love those.

446
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:53,245
But they're your responsibility. You've
gotta show them how we do things.

447
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:57,886
We're gonna challenge you
on all aspects of what we do.

448
00:24:58,095 --> 00:25:00,758
Power, speed,
endurance and teamwork.

449
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,492
May the best mentor-rookie team win.

450
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,296
Bring it on, fool.

451
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:10,439
Well, obviously Lani and I will win.
Let's do this.

452
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,777
Do you know how to surf?

453
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,935
Dude, I'm a star.

454
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,774
Okay, we're in.

455
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,041
All right. Then that's the way
it's gonna be.

456
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,551
If your guy or girl dies or gets hurt and
I have to carry them all the way back...

457
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:27,452
...I'm gonna make you
scrub the whale for a year!

458
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:31,427
All aboard! Next stop, Slaughter island.

459
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,723
So how much did you pay
to bribe those kids?

460
00:25:34,898 --> 00:25:37,628
- Three shells apiece.
- You're such a dork.

461
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:40,735
Not to mention a failure.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

462
00:25:40,904 --> 00:25:42,565
When I become one of the Hang 5...

463
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,072
...I'm gonna come back
and crush your surf school.

464
00:25:45,242 --> 00:25:49,803
All your students will be mine.
And they'll be happy. Ha, ha, ha, ha!

465
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:53,346
- Like me.
- We can't let him win, Cody.

466
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,453
Don't worry. I got this.

467
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,858
Can't this thing go a little slower?

468
00:26:04,593 --> 00:26:06,289
Where would be the fun in that?

469
00:26:06,496 --> 00:26:10,193
We're passing through some
rough waters. It's safer to go fast.

470
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:11,695
Aaah!

471
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:13,496
Joe!

472
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:15,468
Thanks, man.

473
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:18,473
Almost lost my lunch.

474
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,609
Say no more, Under-bro.

475
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:24,110
I can hold your hair if you need to yak.

476
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:32,981
This is just amazing.
Can you believe it?

477
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:36,319
I'm traveling to the Trenches
with the Hang 5. Ha, ha!

478
00:26:36,492 --> 00:26:38,892
Oh, man. Somebody pinch me.

479
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:41,388
- You're welcome.
- Heh.

480
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:48,035
Look, I'm a diva, I'll admit it.

481
00:26:48,205 --> 00:26:50,137
But I'm a power diva.

482
00:26:50,305 --> 00:26:53,536
And I was thinking you fellas
might wanna focus on me more.

483
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,146
We could do a spinoff, Power Diva.

484
00:26:57,347 --> 00:27:00,977
A crime-fighting surfing puff. In
with a bad attitude...

485
00:27:01,151 --> 00:27:02,550
...and a thirst for action.

486
00:27:02,986 --> 00:27:06,682
Oh, it's got blockbuster
written all over it.

487
00:27:08,224 --> 00:27:10,691
# Is gonna stop me now # #

488
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,232
We're almost there.

489
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:23,871
How can you tell? This fog is so thick,
I can barely see anything.

490
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:26,272
My shell told me.

491
00:27:26,776 --> 00:27:29,244
It's a map that talks.

492
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:33,040
What's wrong, bro?
Don't you believe in magic?

493
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:38,183
We'll be there in four, three, two, one.

494
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:39,581
Look.

495
00:27:44,026 --> 00:27:45,550
Gnarly.

496
00:27:45,862 --> 00:27:49,424
It's so beautiful.

497
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:51,763
Are we here? Is this it?

498
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:54,766
No, we're at the edge
of Slaughter island.

499
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,770
The Trenches is hidden here
somewhere. We're going to find it.

500
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:03,770
Forward, ever forward,
our intrepid team presses on...

501
00:28:03,946 --> 00:28:08,041
...woefully unaware that no penguin
has ever ventured into the Trenches...

502
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:10,707
...and lived to tell the story.

503
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,789
Looks like this is
as far as the whale goes.

504
00:28:16,992 --> 00:28:19,461
I got your board for you, Mr. Hunter.
Right here.

505
00:28:19,629 --> 00:28:22,095
- Thanks, Hank.
- It's Tank. It's Tank.

506
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:23,890
Know what? Hank's better, actually.

507
00:28:24,098 --> 00:28:25,794
- Next stop, RTL!
- RTL!

508
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:27,229
RTL!

509
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:29,165
Did they tell you what RTL means?

510
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:31,568
It means "race the losers."

511
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:32,935
Let's get that guy.

512
00:28:38,413 --> 00:28:42,849
Hey, excuse me.
Can you take me back to Pen Gu?

513
00:28:43,018 --> 00:28:46,010
I think I left my sunblock.

514
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:47,779
Come on.

515
00:28:48,123 --> 00:28:50,458
Dude!

516
00:29:22,857 --> 00:29:25,826
Whoa! Look at that.

517
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:28,985
Killer view, bro.

518
00:29:29,396 --> 00:29:30,829
Hey, rookies!

519
00:29:31,031 --> 00:29:32,260
We're down here!

520
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:35,165
Whoo! Yeah! Yes!

521
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:41,704
Oh, my gosh, you can surf on this stuff.

522
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:43,536
Dude, what is this?

523
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,549
The taste of death.

524
00:29:49,718 --> 00:29:53,083
This is crushed whale bones.

525
00:29:53,353 --> 00:29:55,150
I should move here.

526
00:29:55,355 --> 00:29:57,881
The conch is telling me
we have to keep moving.

527
00:29:58,058 --> 00:30:00,788
This place is dangerous.
So let's head out.

528
00:30:00,995 --> 00:30:02,361
What's so dangerous about it?

529
00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:06,059
Hold on. What's that, conch?

530
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:07,756
Okay, I'll tell him.

531
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:10,402
Conch says, shut up!

532
00:30:10,703 --> 00:30:11,829
- Heh, heh.
- Hey.

533
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:16,100
From up here it looks like the sand pit
will take us straight into the island.

534
00:30:16,343 --> 00:30:19,244
That'll save us a ton of time.
How about a race?

535
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:22,404
Last team to the bottom
waxes all our boards tonight.

536
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:25,311
You're on, fool.
Cody and I are gonna smoke you.

537
00:30:25,518 --> 00:30:27,453
Yeah, Tank. You're going down.

538
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:31,589
Ohh, I'm so scared. Not.

539
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:34,121
Ha! Me and Lani will take you on.

540
00:30:34,328 --> 00:30:37,227
And as always, it'll be ladies first!

541
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:40,365
Me and the chicken are in too.
Where is he?

542
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:43,525
Hey, don't take this the wrong way...

543
00:30:43,703 --> 00:30:46,298
...but didn't you used to be taller?

544
00:30:46,473 --> 00:30:48,941
Oh, my gosh,
you're standing in quicksand!

545
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:52,134
Cody, Lani, J.C., help!

546
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:55,977
Lani, pull!

547
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:59,243
I'm trying. He's like a boulder.

548
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:00,545
I got this.

549
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,882
Come on, big guy.
Let's get you out of there.

550
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,618
How much do you weigh?

551
00:31:06,858 --> 00:31:09,555
- Hunter, help me look for the chicken.
- Already on it.

552
00:31:10,296 --> 00:31:13,356
I found him.
There, by that rock. To your right.

553
00:31:13,566 --> 00:31:15,262
Hunh! Gotcha.

554
00:31:16,803 --> 00:31:20,795
Am I dead? Are you my father?

555
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:24,370
Come on!

556
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:37,318
Come on! Come on!

557
00:31:37,823 --> 00:31:39,313
Aah!

558
00:31:39,591 --> 00:31:41,491
Yeah! Go, J.C.

559
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,686
Ha, ha! That's how it's done.

560
00:31:45,098 --> 00:31:47,259
Wow, J.C. Perfect form.

561
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:49,992
- Thanks, kid.
- Very impressive.

562
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:52,159
You gonna put me down now?

563
00:31:52,404 --> 00:31:55,601
You're lucky it's leg day.
I'm just gonna sneak in a quick set.

564
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:03,140
- Thanks, show-off.
- Any time.

565
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:06,009
Leg-pressing a large, heavy boulder.

566
00:32:06,183 --> 00:32:07,980
Then onto a one-handed handstand...

567
00:32:08,152 --> 00:32:10,815
...all while
still leg-pressing the boulder.

568
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:13,014
The secret to my amazing physique?

569
00:32:13,191 --> 00:32:16,184
Eat right, exercise and never give up...

570
00:32:16,362 --> 00:32:19,058
...on being awesome.

571
00:32:21,198 --> 00:32:22,860
Hang 5, let's do this!

572
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:29,068
- All right!
- Yeah! Yeah, dude!

573
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:35,035
Let's see how these wave jockeys
perform on the dunes.

574
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:37,646
They have not put in the hours
shredding the sand...

575
00:32:37,815 --> 00:32:40,512
...but, wow, folks,
they're putting on quite a show.

576
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:42,550
I make this look good.

577
00:32:42,721 --> 00:32:45,485
- Yeah!
- Bring it!

578
00:32:45,691 --> 00:32:47,716
Check this out.

579
00:32:48,193 --> 00:32:49,660
Nice moves, Paige.

580
00:32:49,828 --> 00:32:51,988
- All right.
- We do it old-school.

581
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:54,687
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

582
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:00,901
- Lani, I see a shortcut.
- Right behind you.

583
00:33:01,406 --> 00:33:03,704
Ho, ho! In your face, Hunter.

584
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:08,074
Whee!

585
00:33:09,512 --> 00:33:11,378
Rest in peace.

586
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:14,012
Yeah.

587
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:18,880
Whoa!

588
00:33:19,091 --> 00:33:20,852
Ho-ho!

589
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,691
Yeah!

590
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:27,293
- Bye, J.C.
- Ha, ha, ha. Aw...

591
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:28,893
This is it.

592
00:33:30,702 --> 00:33:33,261
- Eat my dust, Tank.
- Oh, that's what you think.

593
00:33:34,406 --> 00:33:37,271
- Whoa!
- Ha-ha-ha!

594
00:33:40,878 --> 00:33:43,438
Sand's the best!

595
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,907
Cody!

596
00:33:49,755 --> 00:33:53,713
- You still with me, bro?
- Yeah. I think so.

597
00:33:53,924 --> 00:33:55,652
Ha, ha, ha, awesome.

598
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,316
- Paige, we finished first. I can't believe it.
- Yeah!

599
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,996
That was incredible.

600
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:02,530
Ho, ho, ho, unh!

601
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:14,036
That tickled.

602
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:17,580
- Great job out there, Lani.
- Ha, ha, ha!

603
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:19,739
Thanks. That was a lot of fun.

604
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,246
Gotta hand it to you, Paige.

605
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,817
You got me good
when you banked off that rib cage...

606
00:34:23,987 --> 00:34:27,252
- ...and landed in front of me.
- I've got a few tricks you haven't seen.

607
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:29,255
Hey. Check it out.

608
00:34:32,163 --> 00:34:36,462
Hey, flattop. What happened?
You take the scenic route?

609
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:39,601
Heh, heh. Yeah, you know me.
I'm just a bit of a tourist.

610
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:41,100
I like to take in the sights.

611
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:44,502
Remember,
I like a nice high gloss on my board.

612
00:34:44,674 --> 00:34:47,200
Don't get too comfortable.
I'll get you back.

613
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:49,642
That was quite a spill
you took out there.

614
00:34:49,814 --> 00:34:51,302
How does my dust taste?

615
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,879
You cut me off, you cheater.

616
00:34:53,081 --> 00:34:55,846
Oh? I don't know
what you're talking about.

617
00:34:56,085 --> 00:34:58,019
- I'd never do anything to hurt you.
- Hey!

618
00:34:58,188 --> 00:34:59,986
You should learn
to stay out of my way.

619
00:35:00,157 --> 00:35:02,556
I'm gonna join the Hang 5,
no matter what.

620
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:06,387
How badly you want to lose
is entirely up to you.

621
00:35:09,832 --> 00:35:10,992
Grrr...

622
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:16,498
That Tank guy is ridiculous.
He's like a cartoon villain.

623
00:35:16,673 --> 00:35:19,006
Why did you let Hunter bring him?

624
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:21,802
Everyone is here for a reason.

625
00:35:21,977 --> 00:35:25,378
I want to see how
the rest of the newbies deal with him.

626
00:35:25,547 --> 00:35:27,879
You still think Cody has what it takes?

627
00:35:28,116 --> 00:35:30,585
Look, Mr. McMahon,
I know he wiped out out there...

628
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,812
...but he's a good surfer.
Give him a chance.

629
00:35:32,989 --> 00:35:35,480
I'm not talking about surfing.
I've been watching him.

630
00:35:35,657 --> 00:35:39,218
I think he's a bit of a hothead.
He might want this too much.

631
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,920
Don't worry about it.
He's just like me at that age.

632
00:35:42,131 --> 00:35:43,120
He'll be cool.

633
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:46,202
All right, we'll see.

634
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,734
Okay, okay. I've got one.

635
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,703
What did the wave say to the surfer?

636
00:35:53,909 --> 00:35:55,069
Oh, what?

637
00:35:55,277 --> 00:35:57,404
Have a swell time!

638
00:35:59,882 --> 00:36:00,941
Get it, huh?

639
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:02,549
Have a swell time.

640
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,245
Oh, ha, ha, swell. Ha, ha, ha.

641
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:08,355
Oh, that was good. Swell.

642
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:13,119
Oh, Mr. McMahon, that's like
the greatest surfing joke maybe ever.

643
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:15,422
So good. Unh!

644
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:17,220
Thank you.

645
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:20,959
What do you call a surfer
that just broke up with his girlfriend?

646
00:36:21,435 --> 00:36:23,130
Homeless!

647
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:33,745
Dude, Cody. We're just trying to
wax the boards, not set them on fire.

648
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:36,679
You're gonna burn a hole in that thing.

649
00:36:36,884 --> 00:36:38,909
Tank cheated.
He knocked me off my board.

650
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:40,110
That's why we lost.

651
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:44,190
Yeah? I didn't see anything. You sure?

652
00:36:44,393 --> 00:36:47,487
He totally rubbed it in my face.
He practically admitted to it.

653
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:49,459
That's messed up.
But you know what?

654
00:36:49,699 --> 00:36:53,394
Maybe let it go. It's not worth
getting all bent out of shape about.

655
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:58,061
We had an awesome day, right?
Were those dunes gnarly or what?

656
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,400
Yeah. That was pretty epic.

657
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:03,476
And I got to ride with you guys.
It still feels pretty surreal.

658
00:37:03,645 --> 00:37:06,635
I mean, like, I can't believe
this is actually my life right now.

659
00:37:06,814 --> 00:37:10,773
I just... I just wish
that I hadn't let you down.

660
00:37:11,585 --> 00:37:14,180
Let me down?
What are you talking about?

661
00:37:14,356 --> 00:37:17,290
Look, man.
There are plenty of jerks out there.

662
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:21,188
If it's not Tank, it'll be somebody else.
Just take the high road.

663
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:24,991
You'll be a lot happier, I promise.

664
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,325
All right, man. You got it.

665
00:37:29,603 --> 00:37:30,763
- Ha, ha!
- Pull.

666
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:32,372
- Pull.
- Whoo!

667
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:36,234
- Pull. Pull.
- All right!

668
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:39,844
- Why are they sleeping up there?
- Mmm...

669
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:41,809
Maybe they don't like us.

670
00:37:41,982 --> 00:37:45,714
I bet it's a tribal thing, you know?
Paying homage to the surfing gods.

671
00:37:45,886 --> 00:37:47,820
Wrong. None of the above.

672
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:49,821
It's actually for protection.

673
00:37:50,025 --> 00:37:52,116
Protection? From what?

674
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:57,195
This is Slaughter island. Who knows
what's creeping around at night?

675
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,900
And you're gonna want to
plant that board a bit deeper, bro.

676
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,730
- Oh!
- Ha, ha, ha...

677
00:38:03,904 --> 00:38:06,666
You guys sleep up in the nosebleeds
if you want to.

678
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:10,003
Tank Evans is not scared
of some little forest critters.

679
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,510
Neither is my main girl Michelle.
Isn't that right, baby?

680
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:16,707
Big Daddy won't let anything harm you.

681
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:21,149
This is Michelle.

682
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:24,812
We've been together for about...
What is it, babe?... Three years now.

683
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,754
I bought her at a garage sale.

684
00:38:26,926 --> 00:38:31,556
I saw her from across the lawn.
I was like, "Oh, yeah."

685
00:38:31,732 --> 00:38:34,030
Don't get me wrong,
I still ride other boards.

686
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:38,796
But... But, Michelle, she's special.

687
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:41,873
Hey, Tank.
Does Michelle have a friend?

688
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:44,739
Yeah? Well, we're not scared either.

689
00:38:44,912 --> 00:38:48,506
- Yeah. If you're fine with it, I am.
- I ain't afraid of no forest critters.

690
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:50,240
- Totally cool.
- Okay. Yep.

691
00:38:50,418 --> 00:38:52,680
So we're all fine down here.
Oof!

692
00:38:52,851 --> 00:38:56,015
Well, you all sleep tight then.

693
00:38:56,222 --> 00:38:58,554
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

694
00:38:58,758 --> 00:39:00,089
Oh, we won't.

695
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,697
And the bed bugs will bite you.

696
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:06,621
Uh...

697
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,651
Don't hate me, man.
I'm just polishing my trophy.

698
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:48,901
I think I just laid an egg.

699
00:39:49,075 --> 00:39:50,873
I didn't forget about you, babe.

700
00:39:54,012 --> 00:39:55,638
Oh!

701
00:40:01,753 --> 00:40:02,846
Whoa!

702
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:04,353
Nice hang time.

703
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,414
Cody?

704
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,617
Congratulations. You're dead.
Ha, ha!

705
00:40:37,822 --> 00:40:38,846
What?

706
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:44,661
That's what happens when you
don't work together in a place like this.

707
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:46,660
Wait, wait, wait. This was a test?

708
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:50,825
It was. We wanted to see
how well you work under pressure.

709
00:40:51,435 --> 00:40:55,531
Never split up. Understand?
You stick together, no matter what.

710
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:58,676
When you're a team,
you always have each other's backs.

711
00:40:58,844 --> 00:41:00,436
Got it?

712
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:05,312
Well, all things considered,
not bad for your first time.

713
00:41:05,484 --> 00:41:09,418
At least none of you peed your pants.
Right, Hunter? Ha, ha, ha!

714
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:13,984
I told you guys, I sat in a puddle.

715
00:41:14,192 --> 00:41:15,660
- Oh, yeah.
- All right!

716
00:41:15,827 --> 00:41:19,160
Don't worry, Hunter, bro.
I peed my pants too.

717
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:21,025
- I don't have any pants...
- Let's go!

718
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,894
...so I mostly just peed on my feet.

719
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:27,695
I bet you thought it was me
making all that noise. Didn't you?

720
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:35,247
Yeah. You don't wanna mess with me
when I'm in a bad mood.

721
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,531
Can't sleep?

722
00:42:01,906 --> 00:42:05,308
Yeah, I think I need a minute
to calm down from all the excitement.

723
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:08,274
My heart's jumping out of my chest.

724
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:10,379
Yeah, I can imagine.

725
00:42:10,547 --> 00:42:12,640
This has been some day.

726
00:42:12,816 --> 00:42:14,943
Must be a pretty big deal to you.

727
00:42:15,151 --> 00:42:18,383
This is my dream, Lani.
I can't stop thinking about it.

728
00:42:18,556 --> 00:42:20,456
I don't think I blinked once all day.

729
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,649
I didn't wanna miss a second.

730
00:42:27,931 --> 00:42:31,493
Mr. McMahon thinks you're
amazing. He's totally gonna pick you.

731
00:42:31,669 --> 00:42:34,136
I don't know.

732
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:38,467
I miss Pen Gu.
We've been gone for so long.

733
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:41,634
I can't wait to tell our friends back home
about all of this.

734
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:44,105
Heh, heh.
Yeah. They'll never believe it.

735
00:42:44,281 --> 00:42:45,839
I wish every day was like this.

736
00:42:46,082 --> 00:42:49,484
I feel like I'm finally living the life
I've always wanted to, you know?

737
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:51,779
I wish this feeling could last forever.

738
00:42:51,954 --> 00:42:52,979
Heh.

739
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:55,521
Yeah, well, you still gotta sleep.

740
00:42:55,691 --> 00:42:59,992
Yeah, in a minute.
Let's soak this in a while longer.

741
00:43:21,151 --> 00:43:22,946
Uh...

742
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:26,081
Uh!

743
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,997
Cock-a-doodle-dude!

744
00:43:37,399 --> 00:43:40,334
Cock-a-doodle-shut up!

745
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:54,405
I slept like a corpse.

746
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:01,387
Come on, guys.
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

747
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:03,491
Remember what we talked about
last night.

748
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:07,094
After all, this journey isn't just about
getting to the Trenches.

749
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:10,321
One of you will be replacing me
on the Hang 5.

750
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:15,562
Those are some big shoes to fill,
so show me you've got big feet.

751
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:21,043
Yeah.

752
00:44:21,444 --> 00:44:23,273
It says there's supposed to be
a bridge.

753
00:44:23,444 --> 00:44:24,742
- Boss! Stop!
- Mr. McMahon!

754
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:26,038
- Wait, wait.
- Come back!

755
00:44:26,214 --> 00:44:27,875
- Rerouting.
- Look where you're going!

756
00:44:28,049 --> 00:44:29,710
- What's that mean?
- Don't go further!

757
00:44:29,885 --> 00:44:31,716
Hey, what's the holdup?

758
00:44:35,457 --> 00:44:37,424
Ha, ha! You're afraid of heights?

759
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:39,753
Oh, yeah!

760
00:44:48,737 --> 00:44:51,535
Let's have some fun.
I bet you can't get past me.

761
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,744
Oh, you're on.

762
00:44:57,245 --> 00:44:58,940
Whoa, whoa!

763
00:45:00,783 --> 00:45:05,083
Perfectly matched.
This is truly a clash of the titans.

764
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:11,122
Yeah! Show them
how you do it, Mr. Hunter.

765
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,556
You see that?
He blew right past your guy.

766
00:45:13,728 --> 00:45:14,786
Come on, J.C.

767
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:16,657
Oh, yeah?

768
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:20,462
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Ha-ha.

769
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:22,568
Yeah, he showed Hunter what's up.

770
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:24,897
- Come on, Lani.
- Whoa. Yeah!

771
00:45:25,072 --> 00:45:26,767
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

772
00:45:27,074 --> 00:45:28,302
Yeah! Whoo!

773
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,638
Ha-ha-ha.
Nice, Lani. Way to go.

774
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:33,178
Oh, that's cool, but...

775
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:39,451
Come on, wimp. It's our turn.

776
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:41,849
Hope you don't fall to your death
or anything.

777
00:45:44,592 --> 00:45:46,355
Whoa, whoa!

778
00:45:49,631 --> 00:45:50,996
Can you do this?

779
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,859
- Cut it out!
- Ls this bothering you?

780
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:54,330
Is this bothering you? This?

781
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:58,301
Cody Maverick looks like
he's in real trouble. I can't look.

782
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,441
Ha, ha!
Try not to look so scared in front of J.C.

783
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:05,309
Tank, seriously, stop. Whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay.

784
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,743
- Dude, come on.
- This is fun.

785
00:46:08,248 --> 00:46:09,875
Uhn!

786
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,987
- No, I'm good. That was my plan.
- Yeah!

787
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,888
That was gnarly.

788
00:46:23,162 --> 00:46:25,222
- Oh... Oh!
- Cody, no!

789
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:34,974
- Look out!
- Wait for me, guys!

790
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:49,186
You okay, Cody?

791
00:46:49,357 --> 00:46:50,346
Yeah.

792
00:46:50,525 --> 00:46:54,516
Fortunately, this solid stone floor
was here to break my fall.

793
00:46:54,894 --> 00:46:56,829
Where are the others?

794
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,234
Whoa.

795
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,429
Looks like
we're in some kind of a tomb.

796
00:47:06,806 --> 00:47:12,038
Yeah. Whoever these people were,
they really loved surfing.

797
00:47:12,678 --> 00:47:15,307
I think these little symbols
mean something.

798
00:47:16,216 --> 00:47:17,513
Maybe it's a story.

799
00:47:17,717 --> 00:47:18,741
Yeah, see?

800
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:22,854
This one's about a guy
who surfed a wave as tall as a mountain.

801
00:47:23,889 --> 00:47:25,857
And this one
shows a guy surfing on sand.

802
00:47:26,025 --> 00:47:28,755
- We did that.
- Hey, check it out.

803
00:47:28,928 --> 00:47:31,089
Whoa. What does it say?

804
00:47:31,263 --> 00:47:34,256
It looks like
the story of a young penguin.

805
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,959
Pretty good surfer, got some fans.

806
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:39,764
Yeah, definitely looks like
things were going his way.

807
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:42,036
Yeah, yeah, and then?

808
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:44,870
Oh! He got eaten by a bunch of sharks.

809
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:47,878
- Oh! Okay.
- Whoa.

810
00:47:48,081 --> 00:47:49,411
This guy surfed through fire?

811
00:47:49,615 --> 00:47:51,379
Dude, that's hardcore.

812
00:47:51,585 --> 00:47:55,986
Hey, this isn't a tomb.
It's a surfer's hall of fame.

813
00:47:56,855 --> 00:48:00,222
Oh, man. This is so awesome. Wow!

814
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,656
Do you think people
will remember you like that?

815
00:48:03,863 --> 00:48:06,832
A legendary surfer
who did all these amazing things?

816
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,627
Jeez, I hope not.

817
00:48:09,868 --> 00:48:12,131
Really? What?
What are you talking about?

818
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:13,793
This is what I've always wanted.

819
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:16,339
To be remembered as a legend,
somebody respected.

820
00:48:16,508 --> 00:48:17,907
You know, like a real winner.

821
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:23,110
Not me. I want to be remembered
for who I am, not what I did.

822
00:48:23,281 --> 00:48:25,476
Look, Cody,
surfing's awesome and all...

823
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,085
...but there are
a lot more important things in life.

824
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:30,011
You'll see.

825
00:48:30,189 --> 00:48:32,384
I just want to be remembered.

826
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,434
Lani, Lani, it's okay. It's just me, love.

827
00:48:45,604 --> 00:48:47,037
- Paige.
- You all right?

828
00:48:47,206 --> 00:48:49,106
- Yeah.
- Hello?

829
00:48:49,308 --> 00:48:53,334
Cody? Lani? Anyone?

830
00:48:53,511 --> 00:48:54,671
Conch?

831
00:48:55,413 --> 00:48:56,470
Chicken Joe?

832
00:48:56,647 --> 00:49:00,414
It's me.
Oi, over here.

833
00:49:00,618 --> 00:49:02,210
Is everyone okay?

834
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,389
Just me and the big guy.

835
00:49:04,556 --> 00:49:07,318
There's a little doodle
of a door on this wall.

836
00:49:07,491 --> 00:49:10,222
Do you guys see a lever on your side?

837
00:49:10,461 --> 00:49:11,860
I see it.

838
00:49:17,736 --> 00:49:21,365
Whoa! Righteous door.

839
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:23,471
Are we glad to see you guys.

840
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,801
Come on, let's go.
Our friends might need help.

841
00:49:25,976 --> 00:49:28,445
Stop. This place is dangerous.

842
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:35,744
There are lost souls
lurking around every corner.

843
00:49:36,155 --> 00:49:40,682
I can feel them. They seem to be
guarding some kind of treasure.

844
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:45,889
What kind of idiot
would steal from a freaky place like this?

845
00:49:46,097 --> 00:49:50,158
Ha, ha!
I'm rich! I'm rich! Look at how rich I am.

846
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:53,196
I wonder how much gold
we can pack on the whale.

847
00:49:53,403 --> 00:49:56,895
Let's come back with a bigger whale.
No, 10 whales.

848
00:50:08,284 --> 00:50:09,843
The conch says...

849
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,045
There's no reception in here.

850
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:14,713
Let me see if I can get any bars.

851
00:50:15,927 --> 00:50:17,554
All right, there we go.

852
00:50:17,795 --> 00:50:21,731
According to the conch, the penguins
on this island used to worship surfing.

853
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,891
We're in the treasure room of their king,
the wealthiest surfer who ever lived.

854
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:30,199
A rich surfer?
Now I've seen everything.

855
00:50:30,373 --> 00:50:32,000
Mmm...

856
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:36,945
Michelle, we have had
some good times together...

857
00:50:37,115 --> 00:50:41,483
...but I think we both know
Tank Evans deserves better.

858
00:50:41,651 --> 00:50:45,087
Don't worry. It's not me, it's you.

859
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:48,248
Time to hit the road, babe.
Tank needs an upgrade.

860
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:52,826
Hold on a second. The conch tells me
this place is booby-trapped like crazy.

861
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:55,724
We take anything, we die.

862
00:50:55,898 --> 00:50:58,231
What? That's too bad.

863
00:50:58,401 --> 00:51:00,926
Well, I didn't get into this
for the money.

864
00:51:01,104 --> 00:51:02,662
Easy come, easy go.

865
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:05,502
Hey, Tank. Did you hear that?
Don't touch anything.

866
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:07,143
This place is booby-trapped.

867
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:09,277
Say what?

868
00:51:11,347 --> 00:51:13,975
Michelle! How could you?

869
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:15,750
- We've gotta get out.
- Let's go!

870
00:51:19,089 --> 00:51:20,613
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

871
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:22,917
But let's not wait around to find out.

872
00:51:24,093 --> 00:51:26,323
An old aqueduct.
That must lead outside.

873
00:51:26,495 --> 00:51:29,431
Come on, Cody. It's our only shot.

874
00:51:37,107 --> 00:51:39,596
Oh, yeah! Ha-ha-ha.

875
00:51:45,648 --> 00:51:48,880
- Watch out for the darts!
- Shield yourself with your board.

876
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:50,718
Stay together.

877
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:52,353
Oh, look out!

878
00:51:52,522 --> 00:51:53,715
Ow!

879
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:56,980
Aagh!

880
00:52:00,095 --> 00:52:01,084
Oh!

881
00:52:01,263 --> 00:52:04,824
- Which way do we go?
- Follow me. The conch knows the way.

882
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:13,998
I hope Cody made it out.

883
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:18,375
Don't worry, love.
If we made it out, they'll be fine.

884
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:23,143
I love all you guys.

885
00:52:23,351 --> 00:52:24,875
Are you okay, big guy?

886
00:52:25,053 --> 00:52:28,318
I feel very peaceful.

887
00:52:28,489 --> 00:52:30,651
Must be the acupuncture.

888
00:52:34,129 --> 00:52:37,429
- That's a pretty posh board, Tank.
- What?

889
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:39,656
- You didn't take that, did you?
- No, no, no.

890
00:52:39,834 --> 00:52:41,324
This is my old board. It just...

891
00:52:41,502 --> 00:52:44,494
Why all the fighting?

892
00:52:44,672 --> 00:52:46,367
There you are.

893
00:52:47,643 --> 00:52:49,702
Oh, Cody. You're okay!

894
00:52:50,246 --> 00:52:51,440
- Oh...
- Oh-ho.

895
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:52,773
What's with him?

896
00:52:53,013 --> 00:52:55,574
Enjoy it while it lasts.

897
00:52:56,017 --> 00:52:58,417
See, this is the kind of
white-knuckle adventure...

898
00:52:58,586 --> 00:53:01,078
...the power diva is all about.

899
00:53:01,257 --> 00:53:06,251
Imagine, me and like 11 of my besties
traveling the world and kicking butt.

900
00:53:06,896 --> 00:53:10,762
But also making time to hang out
by the pool and gossip.

901
00:53:10,931 --> 00:53:14,197
And at the end of every episode,
I'll slap somebody.

902
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:16,701
It'll be a huge hit.

903
00:53:18,707 --> 00:53:21,767
Mm. Mm.

904
00:53:27,214 --> 00:53:29,079
Hey, guys.
We found some more firewood.

905
00:53:29,549 --> 00:53:31,211
Great. Have a seat.

906
00:53:31,419 --> 00:53:33,444
I saved you some dinner.

907
00:53:34,088 --> 00:53:36,956
- Uh...
- Oops. My bad.

908
00:53:38,225 --> 00:53:40,318
Was I not supposed to eat that?
Heh, heh, heh.

909
00:53:40,761 --> 00:53:43,060
Aagh! You knew that was for me, Tank.

910
00:53:43,264 --> 00:53:46,825
You snooze, you lose, bro.
Survival of the Tankiest.

911
00:53:47,001 --> 00:53:50,232
Came up with that myself.
I may change it to Hankiest later.

912
00:53:50,605 --> 00:53:54,061
Here, Cody.
I picked these fish heads out of the trash.

913
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:57,176
I think there's still
some meat in this one.

914
00:53:57,344 --> 00:53:59,744
Nah, I got a better idea.

915
00:54:01,249 --> 00:54:03,513
Hey, what are you doing?

916
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:05,412
Stop that! Hey, I mean it!

917
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:09,786
You're dead.

918
00:54:10,524 --> 00:54:11,854
- Yeah.
- Whoa!

919
00:54:12,258 --> 00:54:14,352
- Uhn!
- Ls that all you got?

920
00:54:14,795 --> 00:54:17,628
Kick his butt.

921
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:19,258
Heh, heh, heh.

922
00:54:20,234 --> 00:54:22,259
Whoa, whoa, wh...!

923
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:25,666
Whoops! Sorry.
Just stretching my calf muscle.

924
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:28,469
- Ha, ha! How do you like that?
- My tushy!

925
00:54:28,675 --> 00:54:31,474
Not cool, bro.
You can't trip my guy like that.

926
00:54:31,646 --> 00:54:33,511
Oh, yeah?
What do you wanna do about it?

927
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:35,443
It's been a while, dude.

928
00:54:35,615 --> 00:54:39,141
- You think you can still handle it?
- Come on now, you can't see me.

929
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,616
Yeah. I want a piece.

930
00:54:43,056 --> 00:54:45,786
Yeah! Take this.

931
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:47,551
All right. Enough.

932
00:54:48,328 --> 00:54:50,957
It's supposed to be their fight,
remember?

933
00:54:53,065 --> 00:54:54,657
Yeah!

934
00:54:54,868 --> 00:54:58,530
One, two, three. That's it.
We have a winner.

935
00:54:58,704 --> 00:55:01,367
Ha! I kicked your butt with my butt.

936
00:55:01,575 --> 00:55:02,633
Oh, that smells.

937
00:55:02,809 --> 00:55:05,744
That was fun. Let me know
when you're ready for a rematch.

938
00:55:05,912 --> 00:55:08,675
I leave you alone for 10 minutes,
and this is what you do?

939
00:55:08,848 --> 00:55:10,839
I expect rookie mistakes from rookies...

940
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:12,712
...but you guys know better.

941
00:55:12,885 --> 00:55:16,185
And, Cody Maverick,
we'll never get to the Trenches...

942
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:18,756
...if you keep starting fights
with your teammates.

943
00:55:18,925 --> 00:55:21,291
Ah! Yeah. Ha, ha!

944
00:55:22,496 --> 00:55:26,056
Oh, wait.
Are we not doing this anymore?

945
00:55:26,232 --> 00:55:28,367
Oh, my bad.

946
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:32,763
So other than getting
sat on, how do you think you're doing?

947
00:55:32,939 --> 00:55:35,999
Okay, that was not my fault, man.
Hunter called it too early.

948
00:55:36,176 --> 00:55:39,201
- I had Tank right where I wanted him.
- Ha-ha.

949
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:40,504
Where, on your head?

950
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:42,703
That's besides the point,
all right? Okay?

951
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:46,045
Anyways, my head is still in the game,
if that's what you're asking.

952
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:49,586
This is my one big chance to get off
Pen Gu and make something of myself.

953
00:55:49,756 --> 00:55:52,281
I'm gonna show the Hang 5
I've got what it takes.

954
00:55:52,459 --> 00:55:55,825
And I've been working out too.
Check this out. Can you tell?

955
00:55:56,529 --> 00:55:58,087
Uh! Oh...

956
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,092
Oh, okay.

957
00:56:00,266 --> 00:56:02,895
Can you please go get J.C.?

958
00:56:08,873 --> 00:56:13,139
- Cock-a-doodle...
- You're gambling with your life, chicken.

959
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:20,478
Right, yeah.

960
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,415
Okay, got it.

961
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:23,747
Good news, everyone.

962
00:56:23,955 --> 00:56:27,391
According to the conch,
we might reach the Trenches by nightfall.

963
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,584
Then tomorrow morning, it's RTL.

964
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,287
- RTL!
- RTL!

965
00:56:32,665 --> 00:56:35,065
Is anyone ever gonna tell us
what that means?

966
00:56:35,234 --> 00:56:37,998
What? And ruin the surprise?

967
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:40,501
Hey, guys.
You might want to look at this.

968
00:56:41,072 --> 00:56:42,903
Anyone else get the feeling...

969
00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:46,567
...this island really doesn't want us
to reach the Trenches?

970
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,743
Ideas, anybody?

971
00:56:56,019 --> 00:56:58,580
We sure didn't come this far
to give up now.

972
00:56:58,756 --> 00:57:00,747
The conch says
unless we can surf on fire...

973
00:57:00,925 --> 00:57:03,451
...we'll have to find
another way around.

974
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:06,462
But this lava lake is huge.

975
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,429
Come on, Cody.

976
00:57:11,703 --> 00:57:13,431
Surf...

977
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,497
...on fire. Hey.

978
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:17,936
Hey. Hey, guys, wait.

979
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,770
When we were stuck in that tomb...

980
00:57:19,944 --> 00:57:23,005
...I saw some drawings
about a penguin who surfed through fire.

981
00:57:23,182 --> 00:57:26,172
I thought it was just a cool made-up story,
but what if it's not?

982
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,319
What if somebody actually did it?

983
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,012
I have an idea.
It's crazy, but I think it just might work.

984
00:57:32,223 --> 00:57:33,418
Spit it out, kid.

985
00:57:33,626 --> 00:57:35,957
Undertaker, quick, give me a boost.

986
00:57:40,797 --> 00:57:43,061
Who's up for some hang-gliding?

987
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:45,862
- Yeah! That's awesome! Yeah!
- Let's go! Let's do it!

988
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:12,326
Hey, Cody. Nice job coming up
with the idea for these hang gliders.

989
00:58:12,529 --> 00:58:16,830
This is the kind of creative, out-of-the-box
thinking we need in Hang 5.

990
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,764
Ha, ha! Thanks, guys.
This is what I've been talking about.

991
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:24,065
I've got all kinds of ideas.
Like dolphin-powered jet skis.

992
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,504
Underwater breathing devices.
Hey, wait.

993
00:58:26,676 --> 00:58:32,343
What if we put wheels on our surfboards
so we can surf on dry land? Yeah?

994
00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:36,782
Whoa, wheels on a surfboard?
Let's not get too crazy here.

995
00:58:37,021 --> 00:58:39,180
Keep up the good work.

996
00:58:40,891 --> 00:58:43,950
Did you see that?
I'm gonna be in the Hang 5 for sure.

997
00:58:44,126 --> 00:58:45,856
So who's the loser now, huh?

998
00:58:46,029 --> 00:58:48,998
Whatever, chump. It ain't over yet.

999
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:51,531
Oh, not according to
Mr. McMahon and Hunter.

1000
00:58:51,703 --> 00:58:53,601
You better start
packing your bags, Tank.

1001
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:56,260
Because tomorrow,
I'm gonna be part of the Hang 5.

1002
00:58:56,439 --> 00:58:59,238
Traveling the world,
doing the most radical stuff.

1003
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:02,310
And you'll just go back to being
a nobody from nowhere island.

1004
00:59:02,512 --> 00:59:05,743
And you'll never see me again.

1005
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:07,213
What?

1006
00:59:08,151 --> 00:59:10,243
You don't wanna go back to Pen Gu?

1007
00:59:10,419 --> 00:59:12,114
What about our surf school?

1008
00:59:12,288 --> 00:59:13,812
Lani, come on.

1009
00:59:14,023 --> 00:59:16,549
It's the Hang 5, okay?
I'm gonna be famous.

1010
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:19,025
I'll be a hero to millions of kids.

1011
00:59:19,229 --> 00:59:22,427
But you're already a hero
to the kids back home.

1012
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,293
And to me.

1013
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:27,127
This is different. Can't you see that?

1014
00:59:27,303 --> 00:59:29,533
I'll be on the best surf team
on the planet.

1015
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:32,833
I'll finally be somebody.
That's what really matters.

1016
00:59:33,042 --> 00:59:35,011
Hey, Cody. Check out my glider, dude.

1017
00:59:35,178 --> 00:59:36,167
Coming, J.C.

1018
00:59:36,346 --> 00:59:39,142
Come show me how this thing's
supposed to work. Ha-ha-ha.

1019
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:43,347
Eh... Come on, Joe. Let's go.

1020
00:59:43,552 --> 00:59:47,990
I guess we're just a couple of nobodies
from nowhere island.

1021
00:59:57,299 --> 00:59:58,631
Let's be safe, guys.

1022
00:59:59,001 --> 01:00:00,366
This ain't the ocean.

1023
01:00:00,569 --> 01:00:04,335
If you wipe out up here,
you'll be a bucket of extra crispy.

1024
01:00:04,508 --> 01:00:08,806
Oh, man. Just like my uncle,
Chicken Fernando.

1025
01:00:09,444 --> 01:00:12,380
You're going down, twerp.
No more Mr. Nice Tank.

1026
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,208
You are not gonna take my spot
on the Hang 5.

1027
01:00:15,383 --> 01:00:17,477
Okay, let's see what you got.

1028
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,312
On your mark.

1029
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:24,847
Get ready.

1030
01:00:25,994 --> 01:00:27,894
- Hey, watch it, man.
- Heh, heh, heh.

1031
01:00:28,096 --> 01:00:30,531
- Go!
- Yeah!

1032
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,324
Oh.

1033
01:00:34,905 --> 01:00:36,838
Hot, hot, hot.

1034
01:00:38,607 --> 01:00:40,232
All right!

1035
01:00:56,925 --> 01:00:59,189
Loving the lava.

1036
01:01:15,777 --> 01:01:16,766
There you are.

1037
01:01:19,382 --> 01:01:21,008
You're gonna eat it, Tank.

1038
01:01:21,216 --> 01:01:24,241
- Show me what you got. You like that?
- That's not nice. Stop that.

1039
01:01:24,418 --> 01:01:26,750
- Hey, that's not fair. Whoa!
- This is fun.

1040
01:01:31,459 --> 01:01:33,518
Wait, I'm first?
Ha, ha, ha!

1041
01:01:33,695 --> 01:01:34,787
I'm first.

1042
01:01:34,963 --> 01:01:36,864
- Payback time. Ha, ha, ha!
- Oh!

1043
01:01:37,733 --> 01:01:41,292
Whoa! Whoa!

1044
01:01:41,468 --> 01:01:42,561
Whoa!

1045
01:01:42,803 --> 01:01:43,929
Grr...

1046
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:48,107
Oh, you are not taking this
away from me, Tank.

1047
01:01:49,544 --> 01:01:51,171
- Got you.
- What are you doing?

1048
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,743
Whoa! Whoa!

1049
01:01:53,947 --> 01:01:55,414
How do you like me now?

1050
01:01:55,582 --> 01:01:57,880
Oof! Aaah!

1051
01:01:58,085 --> 01:02:01,078
I don't want to be a combo meal!

1052
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,090
Hang on, Joe! I got you, buddy.

1053
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:14,098
Whoa. My board. No!

1054
01:02:22,076 --> 01:02:23,407
All right!

1055
01:02:24,011 --> 01:02:27,412
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

1056
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:30,176
What's going on, everyone?

1057
01:02:31,618 --> 01:02:34,587
The Undertaker saved me from death.

1058
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:36,485
Ironic.

1059
01:02:37,158 --> 01:02:38,182
Where's your board?

1060
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:41,121
You destroyed it
when you bumped Tank into Joe.

1061
01:02:41,294 --> 01:02:44,526
What? Joe, man, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to...

1062
01:02:44,698 --> 01:02:47,565
"Sorry" doesn't cut it, Cody.
What the heck were you thinking?

1063
01:02:47,734 --> 01:02:50,033
Yeah, man. What'd I ever do to you?

1064
01:02:50,238 --> 01:02:52,467
All these years of friendship.
And he still...

1065
01:02:53,974 --> 01:02:56,373
He still keeps these... These walls up.

1066
01:02:56,542 --> 01:02:59,773
And I don't know
how to break them down.

1067
01:03:01,148 --> 01:03:03,946
I just don't know what to think anymore.

1068
01:03:04,117 --> 01:03:05,516
Are you kidding me, dude?

1069
01:03:05,686 --> 01:03:08,383
This guy has been sabotaging me
since day one.

1070
01:03:08,556 --> 01:03:10,146
And you think that makes it okay?

1071
01:03:10,323 --> 01:03:12,314
Well, I... Yeah.

1072
01:03:12,492 --> 01:03:15,427
I was just trying to win.
So I could prove I can be one of you.

1073
01:03:15,595 --> 01:03:19,054
Putting your friends in danger
only proves that you're nothing like us.

1074
01:03:19,266 --> 01:03:20,961
The Hang 5 is a family.

1075
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:24,899
We have each other's back,
no matter what.

1076
01:03:25,171 --> 01:03:28,538
Lani. Tell them I didn't mean for this
to happen. All right? You know me.

1077
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:30,633
Yeah, Cody, I do.

1078
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:34,406
And that's why
I'm just so disappointed in you right now.

1079
01:03:40,986 --> 01:03:43,478
And you were doing so well too.

1080
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,429
I told you from the start
this kid's trouble.

1081
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:02,432
He almost got the chicken killed.

1082
01:04:02,608 --> 01:04:04,200
That would have been on you, J.C.

1083
01:04:04,377 --> 01:04:06,242
Cody's not like that, Mr. McMahon.

1084
01:04:06,412 --> 01:04:08,677
He just got carried away
competing with Tank.

1085
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:11,680
That guy's been acting like a jerk
this whole time.

1086
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:14,081
I wanted to know
how Cody deals with problems...

1087
01:04:14,253 --> 01:04:15,914
...since you thought he was special.

1088
01:04:16,088 --> 01:04:18,113
And now I know. We're a team, J.C.

1089
01:04:18,624 --> 01:04:21,218
That kid doesn't care about
anything other than winning.

1090
01:04:21,394 --> 01:04:24,259
And he doesn't give two sand crabs
about who gets in his way.

1091
01:04:24,428 --> 01:04:26,863
Maybe that's what you saw in him
back at Pen Gu.

1092
01:04:27,032 --> 01:04:28,329
Have you thought about that?

1093
01:05:01,132 --> 01:05:03,067
Cock-a...

1094
01:05:03,235 --> 01:05:04,327
Oh, no.

1095
01:05:04,503 --> 01:05:06,060
You guys, come look at this.

1096
01:05:08,007 --> 01:05:12,567
"Joe, sorry for everything.
You deserve this more than me.

1097
01:05:12,743 --> 01:05:14,837
Your bro, Cody."

1098
01:05:15,013 --> 01:05:19,916
Ha, ha, ha! What a stupid note.
"You deserve this more than me."

1099
01:05:20,086 --> 01:05:23,180
Hey, is anybody else surprised
Chicken Joe can read? Ha, ha, ha!

1100
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:28,183
We have to find Cody.
He couldn't have gotten that far.

1101
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:30,986
That was pretty sad, bro.

1102
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:32,893
Lani, wait.

1103
01:05:33,131 --> 01:05:36,999
I think you gotta let Cody
work things out on his own.

1104
01:05:37,435 --> 01:05:39,028
He'll come back when he's ready.

1105
01:05:39,205 --> 01:05:40,932
But how can you be sure?

1106
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:42,968
I've been where he's at.

1107
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:46,167
Trust me. He just needs time to think.

1108
01:05:50,416 --> 01:05:53,612
It's time we haul our butts
down to the Trenches.

1109
01:05:53,785 --> 01:05:56,183
The best waves come at dawn.

1110
01:05:56,352 --> 01:06:00,380
Does anyone else think
a storm is coming?

1111
01:06:00,557 --> 01:06:02,526
We're counting on it.

1112
01:06:02,694 --> 01:06:05,424
Oh, cool. Right on, then.

1113
01:06:22,047 --> 01:06:23,674
Whoa!

1114
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:34,650
"Here lies the great hero
of Slaughter island...

1115
01:06:34,826 --> 01:06:38,818
...the bravest
and most honored surfer of all.

1116
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:48,663
He gave up his chance
at fame and fortune...

1117
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:52,207
...and he chose to stay with his people
to protect them...

1118
01:06:52,377 --> 01:06:54,935
...from the treacherous waters
of the Trenches...

1119
01:06:55,111 --> 01:07:01,107
...by performing the sacred rites
of Ride the Lightning."

1120
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:02,406
RTL.

1121
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:07,384
Oh, no. I gotta tell Lani and Joe.

1122
01:07:22,106 --> 01:07:23,596
Whoa!

1123
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:33,911
My friends, we finally made it.

1124
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:36,609
Behold, the Trenches.

1125
01:07:54,138 --> 01:07:56,969
Whoa. Look at all these
broken surfboards.

1126
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,631
Must have been some major wipeouts.

1127
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:03,404
I'm not gonna end up like them.
I'm way better than those guys.

1128
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:07,944
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've all been waiting for.

1129
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:18,119
Hang 5, prepare to RTL!

1130
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:20,558
RTL!

1131
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:25,865
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that RTL stands for...

1132
01:08:26,067 --> 01:08:28,661
Ride the Lightning.

1133
01:08:28,837 --> 01:08:32,603
Whoa! Wicked timing
on that delivery, bro.

1134
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:36,336
Surfing during a lightning storm?
You actually planned for this?

1135
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:39,003
Are you guys completely insane?

1136
01:08:39,182 --> 01:08:42,150
Well, yeah.
We figured you knew that about us.

1137
01:08:42,317 --> 01:08:45,650
Lani, we're all about pushing ourselves
to the absolute limit.

1138
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:48,450
And it doesn't get any more extreme
than this.

1139
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,883
I'm sorry, you guys. I can't do this.

1140
01:08:52,093 --> 01:08:55,186
Thank you for the opportunity,
but no, thank you.

1141
01:08:55,362 --> 01:08:56,693
This isn't for me.

1142
01:08:56,864 --> 01:08:59,663
Hey, we understand, love.
No hard feelings.

1143
01:09:00,001 --> 01:09:01,491
What about you, Chicken?

1144
01:09:01,903 --> 01:09:05,237
Are you ready
for a spot on the Hang 5?

1145
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:09,002
I don't think I'm quite ready
for that big chicken bucket...

1146
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,042
...up in the sky just yet.

1147
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:15,546
Oh, hey.
How about an honorary membership?

1148
01:09:15,716 --> 01:09:18,049
Heh, heh, heh. You got it.

1149
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,316
So how about it, Tank?

1150
01:09:25,492 --> 01:09:27,323
So, uh, all I gotta do...

1151
01:09:27,494 --> 01:09:30,987
- ...is surf one gigantic 50-foot wave.
- Yup.

1152
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:33,691
It's in the middle of
a lightning-filled thunderstorm.

1153
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:34,858
Oh, yeah.

1154
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,105
Also off a beach
littered with jagged coral reef.

1155
01:09:38,273 --> 01:09:39,501
Exactly.

1156
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,039
But then I'm in the Hang 5
and I'll be famous...

1157
01:09:42,209 --> 01:09:44,905
...and make lots of money
selling surf videos.

1158
01:09:45,145 --> 01:09:48,047
You gotta do more than surf it,
you gotta survive it.

1159
01:09:48,216 --> 01:09:50,047
And make it look good.

1160
01:09:51,286 --> 01:09:53,414
You in or you out?

1161
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:56,351
Um... In?

1162
01:09:56,523 --> 01:09:59,549
In. I'm definitely in.
This is a good decision.

1163
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,260
- Sweet. Headbutt for good luck.
- Oh!

1164
01:10:02,429 --> 01:10:05,091
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna miss that if I die.

1165
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:06,529
Then let's RTL.

1166
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:07,725
RTL!

1167
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:09,803
Sweet! Yeah!

1168
01:10:11,237 --> 01:10:13,866
I can't watch. But I can't not watch.

1169
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:15,599
I'm a lifeguard, Joe.

1170
01:10:15,776 --> 01:10:18,041
I'm supposed to protect
all beachgoers.

1171
01:10:18,213 --> 01:10:20,477
I swore a Hippocratic oath.

1172
01:10:20,682 --> 01:10:23,919
Hah. Hippos. They're rad.

1173
01:10:30,891 --> 01:10:33,223
Are you sure
we have to paddle out this far?

1174
01:10:33,394 --> 01:10:36,592
It seems far.
I can't even see the beach from here.

1175
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,494
All right, here's how this works.

1176
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:39,826
Don't panic.

1177
01:10:39,999 --> 01:10:43,060
Work as a team.
And keep an eye out for each other.

1178
01:10:43,237 --> 01:10:44,999
And we'll all make it through this.

1179
01:10:45,338 --> 01:10:46,805
Whoa!

1180
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,337
Here we go, Tank.
This is your last test.

1181
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:53,002
Mr. McMahon thinks
you're a yellow-bellied coward.

1182
01:10:53,213 --> 01:10:54,579
- But I told him...
- What?

1183
01:10:54,749 --> 01:10:57,272
...you were the real deal.
Don't let me down, Tank.

1184
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,315
Or we'll all die.

1185
01:10:59,485 --> 01:11:03,616
Do not...
I repeat, do not go rogue out there.

1186
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:05,725
We're all counting on each other.
Got it?

1187
01:11:07,161 --> 01:11:08,185
Okay, here it comes!

1188
01:11:08,362 --> 01:11:09,829
- Yes!
- All right!

1189
01:11:13,599 --> 01:11:15,999
Come on, Tank. It's go time.

1190
01:11:19,673 --> 01:11:21,538
Everybody, ready?

1191
01:11:21,742 --> 01:11:23,642
Yeah, I was born ready!

1192
01:11:23,811 --> 01:11:25,334
Oh, yeah!

1193
01:11:28,748 --> 01:11:29,736
Whoa!

1194
01:11:36,022 --> 01:11:37,854
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Come on.

1195
01:11:43,896 --> 01:11:46,558
This is the moment
we've been waiting for!

1196
01:11:46,766 --> 01:11:49,201
Whoa, this is amazing!

1197
01:11:50,871 --> 01:11:51,859
Let's ride!

1198
01:11:52,038 --> 01:11:53,630
Yeah!

1199
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,814
- No way, man. No, I can't do it.
- Whoa!

1200
01:12:03,316 --> 01:12:05,011
Tank, don't!

1201
01:12:08,789 --> 01:12:11,517
Stay in formation. It's the only way.

1202
01:12:21,234 --> 01:12:22,826
Don't let it touch you.

1203
01:12:23,002 --> 01:12:24,162
Unh!

1204
01:12:24,404 --> 01:12:26,428
Undertaker, I'm coming for you.

1205
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:28,939
- Look out!
- We're not gonna make it!

1206
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:43,952
Help! I got him, he's been hit.

1207
01:12:46,024 --> 01:12:48,822
Move aside! I can save him.

1208
01:12:51,931 --> 01:12:53,330
Oh, I hope I'm not too late.

1209
01:13:03,442 --> 01:13:05,569
Whoa! Good to get out of that mess.

1210
01:13:06,945 --> 01:13:07,935
Oh, crap.

1211
01:13:10,347 --> 01:13:11,746
No!

1212
01:13:14,953 --> 01:13:17,387
Ah. Ooh!

1213
01:13:18,356 --> 01:13:20,120
No!

1214
01:13:21,593 --> 01:13:24,790
Oh, man.
This thing is like a lightning rod.

1215
01:13:24,963 --> 01:13:26,395
No!

1216
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:30,497
Help!

1217
01:13:34,272 --> 01:13:36,001
Tank! Hang on, I'm coming.

1218
01:13:44,248 --> 01:13:46,011
Hunter!

1219
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:49,742
Hunter, Hanky needs you.

1220
01:13:53,925 --> 01:13:56,688
- Hold on.
- Oh, this is a bad idea, Maverick.

1221
01:13:57,027 --> 01:13:59,860
- Stop fidgeting.
- Go left. Go right.

1222
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:03,933
- You're doing it all wrong.
- Enough with the backseat surfing, okay?

1223
01:14:04,102 --> 01:14:06,400
My mom's gonna be
so mad at you if we die.

1224
01:14:17,815 --> 01:14:19,112
Come on.

1225
01:14:28,025 --> 01:14:29,151
No.

1226
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,292
Hang on, Under-bro.

1227
01:14:39,471 --> 01:14:41,164
Clear.

1228
01:14:41,337 --> 01:14:43,498
Aaagh!

1229
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:51,081
Now, that was gnarly.

1230
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:54,317
- You did it.
- Oh, dude. Welcome back.

1231
01:14:54,485 --> 01:14:55,745
You okay, big guy?

1232
01:14:55,951 --> 01:14:59,683
Forget about me. Go help them.

1233
01:15:03,561 --> 01:15:05,893
- What happened to you?
- He came back.

1234
01:15:07,498 --> 01:15:09,330
He risked his life to save Tank.

1235
01:15:13,336 --> 01:15:15,395
Oh! You could have been killed.

1236
01:15:15,572 --> 01:15:17,335
Yeah, I know.

1237
01:15:17,507 --> 01:15:19,270
But it's like you said, J.C.

1238
01:15:19,676 --> 01:15:22,840
We have each other's back,
no matter what.

1239
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:29,916
I think you have something to say
to Cody.

1240
01:15:32,422 --> 01:15:34,891
Thanks, Maverick. Um...

1241
01:15:35,059 --> 01:15:37,390
So are we... Are we cool?

1242
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,426
Uh...

1243
01:15:39,863 --> 01:15:40,885
Yeah, we're cool.

1244
01:15:41,063 --> 01:15:44,032
Awesome. We should hang out.
We should totally hang out.

1245
01:15:44,866 --> 01:15:47,961
Not bad. Not bad at all.

1246
01:15:48,137 --> 01:15:50,537
That's what I saw in him.

1247
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:55,073
Cody Maverick...

1248
01:15:55,307 --> 01:15:57,277
...you're one bodacious surfer.

1249
01:15:58,442 --> 01:16:02,083
But even more importantly,
a good dude.

1250
01:16:02,247 --> 01:16:06,656
On behalf of the Hang 5,
we'd be honored to have you join us.

1251
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:09,790
Gnarly.

1252
01:16:15,096 --> 01:16:18,536
Joining the Hang 5
would be the biggest honor...

1253
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:23,075
...of my entire life.
But I... l have to decline.

1254
01:16:23,372 --> 01:16:25,477
- No.
- Wait, what?

1255
01:16:25,641 --> 01:16:27,645
Dude, are you sure?

1256
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,614
Yeah, bro. I am.

1257
01:16:29,779 --> 01:16:31,917
All this time,
I thought joining the Hang 5...

1258
01:16:32,082 --> 01:16:34,620
...the greatest surF team,
would make me a somebody.

1259
01:16:34,785 --> 01:16:36,355
A winner that eveyone respected.

1260
01:16:37,087 --> 01:16:39,525
But now I know
I'm already part of a great team.

1261
01:16:39,691 --> 01:16:41,661
With the coolest chicken of the sea.

1262
01:16:41,826 --> 01:16:44,598
And the best, raddest surfer
on Pen Gu.

1263
01:16:45,665 --> 01:16:47,034
Tank?

1264
01:16:49,168 --> 01:16:51,540
Oh, right. Yeah.

1265
01:16:52,805 --> 01:16:56,547
Friendship is truly the universe's...

1266
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:58,880
...most precious gift.

1267
01:16:59,045 --> 01:17:03,053
But what does this mean for us?
Now we're one member short.

1268
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,589
- I'm staying.
- Really?

1269
01:17:05,753 --> 01:17:07,691
Yeah, our adventures
are too much fun.

1270
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:09,860
Who wants to iust drink
fish milk coladas...

1271
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:11,829
...on the beach all day anyways?

1272
01:17:12,829 --> 01:17:15,267
Hey, you guys know
what we've never done before?

1273
01:17:15,431 --> 01:17:17,601
Surfed during a tsunami.
Who's up for it?

1274
01:17:17,767 --> 01:17:19,638
- Yeah!
- All right!

1275
01:17:21,205 --> 01:17:22,374
Dude.

1276
01:17:22,573 --> 01:17:25,845
- Ride the RTS.
- Tsunami starts with a T, boss.

1277
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:29,451
Oh, yeah. Ride the RTT. Ha, ha!

1278
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:35,090
Yeah? Yeah? Whoa.

1279
01:17:35,255 --> 01:17:38,361
So that's why
evemhing tastes like me.

1280
01:17:38,526 --> 01:17:39,960
Thanks, dude.

1281
01:17:46,034 --> 01:17:49,608

1283
01:17:51,841 --> 01:17:54,980
- ...for the last couple years?
- Oh, it's been a crazy ride, man.

1284
01:17:55,178 --> 01:17:57,548
But first, I have a question for you.

1285
01:17:57,713 --> 01:17:59,584
Oh, no. Not again. Come on.

1286
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:02,721
We're not gonna finish the show
if you keep changing the script.

1287
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:06,460
Are you a fan of the legenday Hang 5?
Wanna learn extreme surF moves...

1288
01:18:06,624 --> 01:18:09,161
...like the tombstone pile driver
from the Undertaker?

1289
01:18:10,628 --> 01:18:12,431
What about Paige's PTO?

1290
01:18:12,597 --> 01:18:14,501
Well, you can learn those
and many more...

1291

1293
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:23,745
Just like my friends,
Cody, Lani and Chicken Joe.

1294

and hang out with us.

That's Pen Gu SurF Academy.

1298
01:18:34,321 --> 01:18:37,429

1299
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:39,931
Okay. That's a wrap on this episode...

1314
01:20:12,805 --> 01:21:13,095
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
