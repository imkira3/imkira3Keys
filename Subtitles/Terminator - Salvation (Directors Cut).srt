1
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,715
Marcus.

2
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:07,618
How are you?

3
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,054
Ask me in an hour.

4
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,162
I thought I'd try...

5
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,304
...one last time.

6
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,366
You should have stayed
in San Francisco, Dr. Kogan.

7
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,341
By signing this consent form...

8
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:30,506
...you'd be donating your body
to a noble cause.

9
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,311
You'd...

10
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:38,756
...have a second chance,
through my research, to live again.

11
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,189
You know what I did.

12
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,852
My brother and two cops are dead
because of me.

13
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,260
I'm not looking for a second chance.

14
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,941
But I'm not the only one
with a death sentence, am I?

15
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,278
Do you think
I'm gonna cure your cancer, Serena?

16
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,076
I'm not worried about myself.

17
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,015
I'm worried about the future
of the human race.

18
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,782
I'll sell it to you.

19
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,019
For what?

20
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,123
A kiss.

21
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,044
So that's what death tastes like.

22
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,096
You're doing something very noble.

23
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,829
No, I'm guilty.

24
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,008
Just cut me up
until there's nothing left.

25
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,842
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

26
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,751
...I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

27
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,187
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

28
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,032
Do you have any last words?

29
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,600
Vanguard, this is Blackjack 6.

30
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,363
Missile inbound to Skynet target.

31
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,703
TTO 11 seconds. Danger close.

32
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,768
Move! Move!
Let's go, let's go! Move it!

33
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,650
Connor is on the ground.

34
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,691
This mission is a quick in-and-out.

35
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,334
Command deems the information
on those computers...

36
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,298
...to be of the highest priority.

37
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,337
Connor, there's no sign of the machines.

38
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,563
They're gone.

39
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,002
It's way too quiet.

40
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,143
It's almost like they're waiting for us.

41
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,152
It's down, it's down.

42
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,270
What the hell's that smell, man?

43
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,910
You seeing this?

44
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,132
Olsen. Objective located.

45
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,038
There's something else
you have to see.

46
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,223
Hard wall.
Get what we came for, Barbarosa.

47
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,660
The clock's ticking.

48
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,893
Spread out, secure the perimeter.
I got a big gap over here.

49
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,060
Why didn't we know about this?

50
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,168
Sir, I think this is
what Command's looking for.

51
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,002
I'm in their source code.

52
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,440
These people are being taken
to San Francisco.

53
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,240
Some sort of R and D project
for a new Terminator.

54
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,280
Send it to Command.

55
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:45,781
It's uploading. I need two minutes.

56
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,182
Wait, wait, wait.
Go back. Go back.

57
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,916
Stop.

58
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,921
T-800.
A new Terminator.

59
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,256
It's like you said it would be.

60
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,096
- It's worse.
- Get your nose out of that.

61
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,864
None of your business.
You're not leading this mission.

62
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,032
Let's cut these sorry bastards loose.
Come on. Let's go.

63
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,370
- Jericho, come in.
- Watch that.

64
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,035
Come in, Jericho.

65
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,773
Connor, get your ass topside.
Remind those men...

66
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,214
...they need to answer me on the radio,
even if they're dead.

67
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,444
Connor!

68
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,227
Connor, get those men to respond.

69
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,302
Olsen, something's wrong up here.

70
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,841
Topside, come in.

71
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:57,087
Outbound enemy aircraft.
I'm in pursuit.

72
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:02,153
There's human prisoners
aboard that thing. Get after it!

73
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,203
Data transfer complete.

74
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,076
Connor, we're joining you topsi...

75
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,652
Olsen.

76
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,048
Bravo 10,
Bravo 10, do you copy? Over.

77
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,987
Eagle 1 to Bravo 10.
Bravo 10, do you copy? Over.

78
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,397
Bravo 10. Bravo 10., do you copy? Over?

79
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,565
Here.

80
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,831
Bravo 10, identify. Over.

81
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,001
Connor.

82
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,733
We'll send units to the extraction point.

83
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,175
How many survivors are on-site? Over.

84
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,905
One.

85
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,577
Copy.

86
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,141
Return to base, sir?

87
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,116
- RTB?
- Negative.

88
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,916
- Take me to Command.
- Sir?

89
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,383
Command.

90
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,992
Roger. Rerouting.

91
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,475
Request has been denied.

92
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,949
Command doesn't wanna give up
their position. Radio comms only.

93
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,351
- Are they down there?
- Request has been denied, sir.

94
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,515
Need-to-know only.
That's straight from the top.

95
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,021
You open up that ramp...

96
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:38,103
...and you tell them I need divers for
a lock-in! Now!

97
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,200
This is crazy.

98
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,569
John Connor.

99
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,171
Prophesized leader
of the Resistance.

100
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,342
Soldier, you put every man and woman
in this sub in jeopardy...

101
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,808
...with your little frogman stunt.

102
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,979
Let's get one thing straight.

103
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,544
I don't believe in prophecy.

104
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,516
Not when one can rewrite
the future in a heartbeat.

105
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,250
Are we on the same page?

106
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,832
Yeah, we're on the same page.

107
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,368
Good. Good.

108
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,704
So, soldier...

109
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,879
...what the hell are you doing here?

110
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,708
- What did we find down there?
- You'll be briefed...

111
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,350
- ...on a need-to-know basis.
- Well, I need to know.

112
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,544
Because my men died
down in that hole.

113
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,417
What did we find down there?

114
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:10,790
We found a solution, Connor,
that can end this war once and for all.

115
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:17,429
We know the machines use shortwave
transmitters to communicate.

116
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:21,903
Intel has located a hidden signal
under the primary channel.

117
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,706
It allows for direct control
of the machines.

118
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,312
Skynet's a machine,
and like all machines...

119
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,813
...it has an off switch.

120
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,781
Does it work?

121
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:37,548
Will it work? Yes.
Have we field tested it? No.

122
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,425
Give it to me.

123
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,419
I'll do it.

124
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,993
I'll test it.

125
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,962
Connor and his tech-comm unit
have an excellent record.

126
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,661
All right.

127
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,966
All right.

128
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,477
Take Connor topside.
Prepare for lockout.

129
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,817
Connor, we do this right,
the war is over.

130
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,846
We mount our offensive in four days.

131
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,994
Connor.

132
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,425
These are the codes for the signal.

133
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,761
- Good luck.
- Why four days?

134
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,427
A kill list was intercepted
from Skynet.

135
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,972
It says everyone in this room
will be dead by week's end.

136
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,610
You're number two on the list.

137
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:39,514
- Well, who's number one?
- An unknown. A civilian. Kyle Reese.

138
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,742
Jericho. come in.
,

139
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,510
Come in, Jericho.

140
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,015
Barnes.

141
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,688
My brother,
he didn't make it, did he?

142
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,942
This is tape number 28
of Sarah Connor to my son, John.

143
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,212
What's most difficult
is trying to decide...

144
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,879
...what to tell you and what not to.

145
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,922
Should I tell you about your father?

146
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,960
ill it affect your decision to
send him back in time to protect me...

147
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,223
...knowing that he is your father?

148
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,596
And he'll be younger than you.
Only a teenager when you meet him.

149
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,431
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

150
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,265
But if you don't send Kyle,
you can never be...

151
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,002
...and Skynet will win the war.

152
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,313
You want to talk about him?

153
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:58,454
Kyle is out there somewhere alone,
and Skynet is hunting him.

154
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,183
What about the signal?

155
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,992
What do you think?

156
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,164
If it works, it's incredible.
Yeah.

157
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,673
- We have to be careful.
- I agree.

158
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,937
- But we have to try.
- Okay.

159
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,974
All right, start with something small
that we're familiar with.

160
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:31,320
We should capture a Hydrobot,
bring it in for testing.

161
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,615
Yeah.

162
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:35,888
What is it, John?

163
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,460
Kill Kyle Reese, reset the future...

164
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,900
...no John Connor.

165
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,102
Hey!

166
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,417
Come with me if you wanna live.

167
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,651
What is that?

168
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,991
She doesn't talk,
but you need to start.

169
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,319
Where'd you get that jacket?

170
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,053
The other guy didn't need it.

171
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,888
You see that red?

172
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,899
It stands for blood.
It's a symbol of the Resistance.

173
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:35,233
You're obviously not
a Resistance fighter, so take it off.

174
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,641
Take it off!

175
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,168
You point a gun at someone...

176
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,973
...you'd better be ready
to pull the trigger.

177
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,180
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

178
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,486
- What the hell was that thing?
- Terminator.

179
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,887
T-600.

180
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,825
What day is it?

181
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,763
What year?

182
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,838
2018.

183
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,175
What happened here?

184
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,743
Judgment Day happened.

185
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,377
I gotta get out of here.

186
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,614
You can't go on foot.
The machines will cut you down.

187
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,588
You need speed.

188
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,953
I need a car.

189
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,096
Well, look, there's some
by Griffith Observatory.

190
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,129
- They don't run though.
- Take me.

191
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,227
Get down!

192
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,128
That was a Hunter-Killer.

193
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,836
Thanks to you, they know we're here.

194
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,004
What's your name, kid?

195
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,572
Kyle Reese.

196
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,805
Come on.

197
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,619
We burned out his transmitter
so it can't talk to any of its pals.

198
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,019
But he can still receive.

199
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,852
Turn it on.

200
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,320
You got it?

201
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,192
Hold it down, hold it down.

202
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,961
Turn the signal up.

203
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,106
Give me the strap.

204
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,313
- Holy shit.
- Do you believe it?

205
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,379
All right. Strap it tight.
The signal has to be continuous.

206
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,318
If there's any interruption...

207
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,718
Okay.

208
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,129
Let's rig up a portable shortwave,
test it on something larger in the field.

209
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,497
All right.

210
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,967
Destroy this thing.

211
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,017
So where are the cars?

212
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,247
You don't wanna go out after dark.

213
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:42,519
Hunter-Killers have infrared,
hunt better at night.

214
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,058
We'll all go tomorrow morning.

215
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,668
What is that?
Two-day-old coyote.

216
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,540
Better than three-day-old coyote.

217
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,711
Hey, hey!

218
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,951
- Grab it.
- What?

219
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:18,696
Grab it.

220
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:28,763
Magic.

221
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:35,941
Got it?
Yeah.

222
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,644
Thanks.

223
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,953
Does this radio work?

224
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,057
No.

225
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:51,161
My dad tried to fix it,
but he could never get it to work.

226
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,478
Hold that.

227
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,180
Where is everybody?

228
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,521
They're gone.

229
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,023
So why are you still here?

230
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:24,128
Because we're the Resistance,
L.A. branch.

231
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,526
Welcome to the headquarters.

232
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,429
Resisting what?

233
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,163
Machines. Skynet.

234
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,102
Just the two of you?

235
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,273
How come you're not
wearing one of these?

236
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:44,205
Because I haven't earned mine yet.

237
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,157
I hope he's listening to this.

238
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,491
We've been fighting a long time...

239
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:05,159
...and we have all lost so very much,
so many loved ones gone.

240
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,202
But you are not alone.

241
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,535
There are pockets of Resistance
all around the planet.

242
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,709
We are at the brink.

243
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,409
Do you wanna see a magic trick?
Hold that up.

244
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,880
Press the button.

245
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,821
Effective range of their
main weapon is less than 100 meters.

246
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:34,830
They pack a lot of firepower,
but the T-600s are heavy and slow.

247
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,695
They are a primitive design.

248
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,859
- Who is that?
- If you can't outrun them...

249
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,335
- I don't know.
- ...then you have one option.

250
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,067
Their motor cortex is partially
exposed at the back of their neck.

251
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:49,339
A knife to this area will disorient
their tracking device, but not for long.

252
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:53,183
Above all, stay alive.
You have no idea...

253
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:57,788
...how important you are,
and how important you will become.

254
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:01,289
The machines are advancing
even faster than I told you they would.

255
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,926
I've seen it with my own eyes.

256
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:06,689
They're inventing new Terminators,
new ways of killing us.

257
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,401
Skynet is planning something big.

258
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:13,265
But the Resistance
is planning something bigger.

259
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:16,734
This is John Connor.

260
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:21,141
If you're listening to this,
you are the Resistance.

261
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,205
John Connor.

262
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,276
We gotta find this guy.

263
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:48,230
Ow.

264
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:05,287
So you get it working?
Almost.

265
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:09,154
Good. Look,
I figure we head east, right?

266
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,956
We go through the desert, then we can
connect with the Resistance there.

267
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:16,858
- I'm heading north.
- No, no, no.

268
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:20,436
The machines control the whole
northern sector, up to San Francisco.

269
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,869
- That's Skynet Central.
- I have to find someone.

270
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,839
There's a lot you don't understand
about Skynet, okay?

271
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,980
It's just too dangerous for us
to go there.

272
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,181
What about the L.A. branch?

273
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:41,190
Come on, man.
We need to get out of L.A.

274
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,382
What is that?

275
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,710
Something my brother
used to listen to.

276
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,515
Star, get out.

277
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,394
Don't look at me like that, Star.

278
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,164
Out. Get out!

279
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:27,405
You're leaving?
You're gonna leave us?

280
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,674
Oh, I get it.

281
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,674
You wanna know the difference
between us and the machines?

282
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,547
We bury our dead.

283
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,883
But no one is coming to bury you.

284
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,860
Aerostat!

285
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,432
- It's a scout for the Terminators.
- Go, drive!

286
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,477
The Aerostats heard the music!

287
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,811
- Keep it steady!
- I've never driven before.

288
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,625
Hold the wheel!

289
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,832
This thing's pissing me off!

290
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,671
Kid!

291
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:41,169
Hold on!

292
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:01,088
If the idea is to stay alive,
I'm driving.

293
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:08,134
We're seeing a lot
of enemy movement in L.A.

294
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,670
Any of our people in the area?

295
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:15,108
No one on the ground. Two A-10s
in the air. Williams and Mihradi.

296
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,373
Send the birds in.

297
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,844
Guide them to a safe area.

298
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:24,644
Roger, Coyote 67 copies all.
Inbound to grid Lima-Alpha...

299
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:26,688
...125793. Over.

300
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,383
Copy that.
Roger, Wild Eagle. Solid copy.

301
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,851
Hey, there's someone here.

302
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,123
Get off him, get down!
Get down. Down!

303
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,351
Drop your weapon!
Let me see your hands!

304
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,051
Don't move.
: That's it, drop it.

305
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,060
Put it down!
What?

306
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,434
- Is there a problem?
- Hey, we saw your Resistance sign.

307
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,366
The old lady put it there, not me.

308
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,105
- What do you want?
- We're looking for fuel.

309
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,472
The dark season's coming.

310
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,807
We only got enough for ourselves.

311
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:00,940
You point that gun at somebody,
you better be ready to pull the trigger.

312
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,980
Put your guns down, everyone.

313
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:11,454
Look, we just came
to find the Resistance, that's all.

314
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,096
The Resistance?

315
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:17,131
What a joke.
Fighting those machines is impossible.

316
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,133
We keep our heads down,
they ignore us.

317
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,568
They'll come for you eventually.

318
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,331
We help you, maybe they will.

319
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,502
These people aren't going to help you.
Let's go.

320
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,077
You're not going anywhere.

321
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,108
Not until this one
gets something to eat.

322
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,318
Bring me a basket.

323
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,591
Here you go.

324
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,258
Come on.
Help yourself. Eat up.

325
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,202
Are you all right, son?

326
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,548
It's our food.

327
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:09,983
Our fuel.
It's not your choice to make!

328
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,249
- Are you okay?
- What?

329
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,754
Are you okay?!

330
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,018
Star. Star.
Star! Star!

331
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,890
You! You brought them here!

332
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:56,728
Hey!

333
00:38:56,901 --> 00:39:00,769
Stop! Stop!
Come on, quick!

334
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:05,375
Hey.
Go! Go! Forget them! Go! Go!

335
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:09,913
Go!

336
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:18,454
Tunnels! Head for the tunnels!
Truck!

337
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,767
Marcus. Marcus.

338
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,601
We can't just run for it!

339
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,612
Run!

340
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,581
Shoot it!

341
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,290
Go, go, go!

342
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,271
It didn't work!

343
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,097
Shit!

344
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,138
Hell, yeah!

345
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,820
Moto-Terminators!

346
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,438
Shoot that son of a bitch!

347
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,190
Marcus, turn right up here.

348
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,708
Hold on!

349
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,580
Where's the other one?

350
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,304
Get up here!

351
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,170
Come on.

352
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:04,012
Star, give me the gun.

353
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,439
I got it.

354
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:10,010
Yeah!

355
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:20,321
Hang on!

356
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,697
- Drop the ball!
- All right.

357
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,541
Star, hold on!

358
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,091
Star! Star!
No!

359
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,895
Kyle!
Marcus.

360
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,227
Get back.

361
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,637
Marcus! Marcus!

362
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,376
Got eyes on two targets.

363
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,074
We've got two bogeys at 270 degrees.

364
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:24,619
They've never come this deep before.
They're looking for something.

365
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,586
H.K. is down.

366
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,608
We've got an H.K. pushing our six.

367
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,907
Abort run.
Breaking off.

368
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:00,684
Evasive maneuvers, now!

369
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,324
Taking fire. I'm hit. Port-side damage.

370
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:16,201
It's got a lock on you: Break off.

371
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,206
- Eject, Williams, eject!
- Punching out.

372
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:43,826
Prisoner transport
headed northwest...

373
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,492
...bearing 289 toward San Francisco.

374
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:51,034
Let's test the signal...

375
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,473
...and pray it works.

376
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:51,561
You okay?

377
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:54,465
Get my knife. It's in my left boot.

378
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,537
What's your name?

379
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,739
Blair Williams.

380
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:08,876
What's yours?

381
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:14,385
Name's Marcus.

382
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:17,590
You can let me down now, Marcus.

383
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:30,600
- That thing, where'd it go?
- The transport? Skynet.

384
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:33,937
- Where the hell are you going?
- After it.

385
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:37,740
I hate to break it to you,
but if you have friends on that thing...

386
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,851
...they're as good as dead. And same
as you, if you walk in that direction.

387
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,852
Yeah, I've been dead a while
and I'm getting used to it.

388
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,990
Why don't you come with me
to my base?

389
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,284
Connor might know a way.

390
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,030
If you have a problem
with the machines...

391
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,690
...he's definitely the guy
you wanna talk to.

392
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:03,334
- How far is your base?
- Should be one or two days' hike.

393
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:05,168
And it's that way.

394
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,528
What are you saying? Speak English!

395
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:39,332
I was telling him it is not true
about the machines killing us.

396
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,377
They're gonna kill us.
They're gonna kill everyone.

397
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,878
We're on the way
to the slaughterhouse!

398
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:48,041
Calm down. You're not helping.

399
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:53,581
The most important thing we can do
right now is stay alive.

400
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,418
In here and in here.

401
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,994
All right? Just stay alive.

402
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,910
Over there.

403
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:27,754
Find something we can burn.
We'll be at my base tomorrow.

404
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,021
Are you hurt?

405
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,458
I'm fine.

406
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,197
What do you got there?

407
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,037
Just some antibiotics.

408
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:57,305
Antibiotics are hard
to come by these days.

409
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,882
Listen. I don't have much, but
you're welcome to whatever you need.

410
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:02,880
We've been watching you.

411
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,214
You looking for this?

412
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:11,327
Come on, guys.
The machines are the enemy.

413
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:13,986
- We're all on the same side.
- No, no.

414
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,564
You see,
I got a couple friends on my side.

415
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:20,134
Maybe they can carry you home
when I'm done with you.

416
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,636
You might want to chamber a round.

417
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:27,908
Oh, no.
No.

418
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,712
We done caught us a donkey!
Been waiting for you.

419
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,002
Richter!

420
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:14,384
Killing me ain't gonna win this war!

421
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,837
Thinking about your past?

422
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:13,840
You know what I've learned, Marcus?

423
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:19,785
Is you can focus on what is lost...

424
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:27,027
...or you can fight for what is left.

425
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:40,840
I'm a little cold.

426
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,183
Relax.

427
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,525
I just want some body heat.

428
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,867
You have a strong heart.

429
00:55:06,737 --> 00:55:09,365
God, I love that sound.

430
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:19,409
Thank you for saving me back there.

431
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,715
I don't meet a lot of good guys
these days.

432
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:26,886
I'm not a good guy.

433
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:35,254
You are.

434
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,757
You just don't know it yet.

435
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,737
Do you think people deserve
a second chance?

436
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:57,078
Yeah, I do.

437
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:05,025
This is it. Skynet's valley of death.
We never been this deep before.

438
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,096
We gotta be sure the signal works
in their territory...

439
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:10,290
...on the bigger machines.

440
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,274
That'll bring them in.

441
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,829
H.K. incoming.

442
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,850
Turn it up!

443
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:31,002
It works, man.
The signal works. It's beautiful.

444
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:43,652
Commander Ashdown's on.

445
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,294
Connor, tell me it works.

446
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:48,362
It works. That is affirmative.
The signal works.

447
00:57:48,532 --> 00:57:52,400
Good. The attack commences
tomorrow at 0400, worldwide.

448
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:56,061
Your unit will be in support
of the bombing of Skynet Central.

449
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,571
What is the extraction plan
for the prisoners?

450
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:00,903
Extraction plan?
There is no extraction plan.

451
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:05,377
- We're gonna level the place.
- Negative. I told you...

452
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:08,712
...Skynet Central
is filled with human prisoners!

453
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:11,547
This is war, Connor.

454
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:15,521
Leadership has its costs.
You, above all, should know that.

455
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:19,552
Ashdown, come in!

456
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,761
Ashdown, Connor.

457
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,765
Ashdown, come... Damn him!

458
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:40,775
Star! Get back! Get back!

459
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:50,117
You have to calm down now.

460
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:07,137
I gotta get out!
I gotta get out of here!

461
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,053
Blair?

462
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,627
What?

463
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:32,663
This is us. The mines are magnetic.

464
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:36,169
If we head due west
at this point of entry, we're good.

465
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,171
I'll go first.

466
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,805
Let's go, Marcus. I'm starving.

467
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:22,150
For thou art with me.

468
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,777
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

469
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,286
Father.

470
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:32,289
This is the beginning...

471
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,862
...of something wonderful.

472
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:37,392
Son of a bitch is heavy.

473
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,899
What have we got?
He stepped on a land mine.

474
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,469
Start a large-bore IV.

475
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:43,903
- Keep it open. More morphine.
- I'm okay.

476
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:46,736
- What's his name?
- Marcus.

477
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:52,307
- He's got a prosthetic limb?
- What?

478
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,474
Okay, pulse is good.
Let's see what we've got.

479
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:02,918
Barnes.

480
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:10,430
The devil's hands have been busy.

481
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,100
What is it?

482
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:18,535
It's real flesh and blood,
though it seems to heal itself quickly.

483
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:22,508
The heart is human
and very powerful.

484
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,340
The brain, too,
but with a chip interface.

485
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,348
- What have you done to me?
- It has a hybrid nervous system.

486
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,120
One human cortex, one machine.

487
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:34,279
Blair, what have they done?

488
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:36,850
Who built you?

489
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:41,127
My name is Marcus Wright.

490
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,289
You think you're human?

491
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,458
I am human.

492
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,652
No!

493
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,398
No!

494
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,729
Where were you manufactured?

495
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,930
I was born...

496
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:29,510
...August 22, 1975.

497
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:30,976
No.

498
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,013
I know you.

499
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,853
I heard your voice on the radio.

500
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:49,927
- You're John Connor.
- Of course you know me.

501
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:52,634
You were sent here to kill me.

502
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:55,637
Kill the leadership.

503
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:59,365
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Then why are you here?

504
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:02,705
Blair said you'd help me
find who I'm looking for.

505
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:09,842
- Now, let me down.
- If I let you down...

506
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,884
...you'll kill everyone in this room.

507
01:03:13,056 --> 01:03:16,787
Just you, Connor.
Because I don't give a shit about you.

508
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,718
I didn't know your name
till two days ago.

509
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,386
No.

510
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,726
You and me...

511
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:33,141
...we've been at war
since before either of us even existed.

512
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:38,140
You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.

513
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:42,242
You killed my father, Kyle Reese.

514
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,581
You will not kill me.

515
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:52,595
Kyle Reese is on a transporter
heading for Skynet.

516
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,761
If I wanted to kill him...

517
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,329
...I'd have done him in L.A.

518
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,032
Where'd you find that thing?

519
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:09,110
You sent Mihradi and me
to provide cover for some civilians.

520
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:12,680
- He was one of them.
- Was there a teenage boy?

521
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:16,341
I don't know. They were taken into
a transport. He was the only one left.

522
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,453
Not "he," Blair: "It."

523
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,446
It was the only one left.
Don't be naive.

524
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:23,520
It saved my life.

525
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,624
Kate, what's gonna happen to him?

526
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:32,366
Disassembled.

527
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:36,638
- You mean killed.
- It may have information on Skynet.

528
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:43,069
I know he's not the enemy. I've been
shot at by the enemy. That's not him.

529
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:47,205
That machine saved you
only to gain access to kill all of us.

530
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:30,621
We're gonna be okay. Don't worry.

531
01:05:47,469 --> 01:05:49,460
For my brother.

532
01:05:59,948 --> 01:06:02,314
No!

533
01:06:08,323 --> 01:06:10,257
Connor wants to see you.

534
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:11,483
What for?

535
01:06:12,494 --> 01:06:15,122
Like he's gonna tell me, Barnes.

536
01:06:17,165 --> 01:06:18,757
Let me see that.

537
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,131
Want me to tell Connor
you're not coming?

538
01:06:27,308 --> 01:06:28,741
No.

539
01:06:33,014 --> 01:06:34,845
Watch him.

540
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:04,872
I told you everything I know, John.

541
01:07:05,046 --> 01:07:08,015
Skynet is ruthless
and unpredictable.

542
01:07:08,183 --> 01:07:11,346
They will use the best part of you
against yourself.

543
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:15,285
And they will have methods
I can't imagine or predict...

544
01:07:15,456 --> 01:07:17,890
...that I can't help you with.

545
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:23,053
And when you're unsure, well,
just always follow your heart, John.

546
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:26,667
I love you. Goodbye.

547
01:07:28,403 --> 01:07:31,031
There's nothing
about machines with organs.

548
01:07:31,206 --> 01:07:33,071
That thing in there...

549
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:37,736
I thought I knew our enemy.

550
01:07:37,912 --> 01:07:41,678
But that thing, that makes me feel
like I know nothing.

551
01:07:43,818 --> 01:07:48,050
I looked in its eyes, and it believes,
absolutely believes...

552
01:07:48,223 --> 01:07:49,485
...that it is human.

553
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:52,990
It believes everything that it says.

554
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,253
And it is telling me...

555
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:57,330
...that Kyle Reese is in Skynet.

556
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,261
If that is true...

557
01:08:00,435 --> 01:08:05,873
...then Command is about to bomb my
father and the rest of those prisoners...

558
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,941
...and I cannot stop them.

559
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,048
Thank you.

560
01:08:18,419 --> 01:08:19,784
Come in.

561
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,786
What's up?
Blair said you needed me.

562
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:46,903
Get in.

563
01:08:48,283 --> 01:08:49,375
Get him.

564
01:08:56,891 --> 01:09:00,952
- Barnes. What about Blair?
- She made her choice.

565
01:09:01,162 --> 01:09:02,754
Get down!

566
01:09:14,909 --> 01:09:16,501
Let's move.

567
01:09:28,489 --> 01:09:31,287
Get some light out there!
We're back in the minefield.

568
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:32,619
I have a plan.

569
01:09:47,442 --> 01:09:49,967
Let's run!
There they go, they're on the move.

570
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,277
Blair, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay!

571
01:09:58,453 --> 01:10:00,444
I can't see back!
There they are!

572
01:10:01,389 --> 01:10:03,050
Run! Go!

573
01:10:14,135 --> 01:10:15,898
Now what?

574
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,662
My plan stopped at the jeep.

575
01:10:19,574 --> 01:10:22,634
Sniper Team 1, do you have a shot?

576
01:10:28,983 --> 01:10:32,749
I'll draw the fire.
You take out the light.

577
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,886
I got a target!

578
01:10:47,101 --> 01:10:51,435
Go! Now! Keep your head down!
Keep your head down!

579
01:10:51,606 --> 01:10:54,268
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

580
01:10:54,442 --> 01:10:56,034
Go! Go, keep running!

581
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:03,916
Come on! Come on!

582
01:11:08,523 --> 01:11:11,788
- You all right?
- Let's get you out of here.

583
01:11:17,065 --> 01:11:18,965
There they are!

584
01:11:36,217 --> 01:11:39,948
Stay on the ground!
Stay on the ground!

585
01:11:40,988 --> 01:11:42,819
2 You come
on straight down. I'm going in.

586
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:45,754
Do not move!
Keep your eye on him!

587
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,484
Flip him!

588
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:32,538
Iron Gator, this is
Scarface 51. We have eyes on the machine.

589
01:12:32,707 --> 01:12:34,800
Contact initiated.

590
01:12:48,222 --> 01:12:50,156
Take my gun!

591
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:25,056
Check the river.

592
01:13:40,775 --> 01:13:42,208
You see him?

593
01:14:08,469 --> 01:14:09,697
Hydraulics are out!

594
01:14:22,049 --> 01:14:24,813
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

595
01:15:13,434 --> 01:15:16,426
- They know you, even if you don't.
- Enough!

596
01:15:17,371 --> 01:15:19,134
That gun ain't gonna stop shit!

597
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:22,208
Nobody's shot you in the heart,
and I see that thing beating!

598
01:15:22,376 --> 01:15:23,968
Kyle Reese.

599
01:15:24,378 --> 01:15:27,370
He's in Skynet.
You do that, he's dead.

600
01:15:27,882 --> 01:15:30,043
I can get you in.

601
01:15:31,052 --> 01:15:32,314
How?

602
01:15:38,726 --> 01:15:40,626
Look at me.

603
01:15:42,063 --> 01:15:44,122
That's why I don't trust you.

604
01:15:46,233 --> 01:15:48,724
I'm the only hope you have.

605
01:15:52,306 --> 01:15:55,241
I need to find who did this to me.

606
01:15:56,577 --> 01:15:58,306
So do you.

607
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:00,640
Connor!

608
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:08,754
Make your choice.

609
01:16:10,091 --> 01:16:12,025
You get me in.

610
01:16:14,428 --> 01:16:18,762
You tell me where I can find
Kyle Reese.

611
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,263
Yeah?

612
01:16:22,436 --> 01:16:24,097
I will.

613
01:16:29,777 --> 01:16:34,544
Contact me on that.
Let me know he's still alive.

614
01:16:40,254 --> 01:16:41,278
What are you?

615
01:16:42,356 --> 01:16:44,119
I don't know.

616
01:16:50,798 --> 01:16:53,130
He's over here!

617
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:57,532
You all right?

618
01:16:58,472 --> 01:17:00,531
Any sign of him?

619
01:17:01,475 --> 01:17:02,965
He's gone.

620
01:17:10,718 --> 01:17:11,980
Why'd you do it?

621
01:17:13,654 --> 01:17:15,485
I saw a man...

622
01:17:15,656 --> 01:17:17,556
...not a machine.

623
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:27,224
How's that leg?

624
01:17:27,401 --> 01:17:30,336
- I'll live.
- Let her go!

625
01:17:39,847 --> 01:17:41,940
Connor? Command for you.

626
01:17:43,918 --> 01:17:46,443
- This is Connor.
- Connor, are your men ready?

627
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,679
Negative. Nobody is ready.

628
01:17:48,856 --> 01:17:53,691
We are not, you are not. We must abort
the attack. The game has changed.

629
01:17:53,861 --> 01:17:57,262
What are you talking about? All
elements are past their release points.

630
01:17:57,431 --> 01:17:59,023
They're in assault position.

631
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,863
Then delay the attack. At least,
delay the attack. I have a chance...

632
01:18:03,037 --> 01:18:06,803
...to infiltrate Skynet and rescue those
prisoners. Give me that opportunity.

633
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:10,535
No, absolutely not! This is not
the time for a rescue mission!

634
01:18:10,711 --> 01:18:13,202
What you ask for will undermine
the whole operation.

635
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:15,940
Skynet has Kyle Reese.

636
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:19,041
- Then that is his fate.
- It's our fate.

637
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:22,053
I have to save him. He is the key.

638
01:18:22,223 --> 01:18:27,320
The key to the future, to the past.
Without him, we lose everything.

639
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:29,326
No, you stay the course!

640
01:18:29,497 --> 01:18:33,729
If we stay the course, we are dead!
We are all dead!

641
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:36,799
As of this moment, soldier...

642
01:18:36,971 --> 01:18:38,734
...you are relieved of your command.

643
01:18:38,906 --> 01:18:42,501
You are no longer a part
of this Resistance.

644
01:18:49,483 --> 01:18:51,815
I didn't catch that last statement.

645
01:18:51,986 --> 01:18:53,920
Neither did I.

646
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:57,987
This is John Connor.

647
01:18:58,158 --> 01:19:01,389
If you're listening to this,
you are the Resistance.

648
01:19:02,263 --> 01:19:05,858
Listen carefully.
If we attack tonight...

649
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:08,433
...Our humanity is lost.

650
01:19:08,769 --> 01:19:12,671
I once knew a woman who told people
to fear the future...

651
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:16,936
...that the end was coming,
that all would be lost.

652
01:19:17,111 --> 01:19:22,515
Nobody wanted to hear her truths.
Society locked her away.

653
01:19:22,683 --> 01:19:26,949
That woman was Sarah Connor,
my mother.

654
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:31,290
Now we know that what she
predicted has all come to pass.

655
01:19:31,959 --> 01:19:33,893
Command wants us
to fight like machines.

656
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:37,121
They want us
to make cold, calculated decisions.

657
01:19:37,298 --> 01:19:39,459
But we are not machines!

658
01:19:39,633 --> 01:19:44,434
And if we behave like them,
then what is the point in winning?

659
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:49,305
Command is going to ask you
to attack Skynet.

660
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:52,602
I am asking you not to.

661
01:19:54,949 --> 01:19:59,648
If even one bomb drops on Skynet
before sunrise...

662
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:02,653
...our future will be lost.

663
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:07,121
So please, stand down.
Give me the time...

664
01:20:07,795 --> 01:20:10,161
...to protect our future that all of us...

665
01:20:10,965 --> 01:20:13,160
...are fighting for.

666
01:20:15,302 --> 01:20:17,600
This is John Connor.

667
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:44,458
What should I tell your men
when they find out you're gone?

668
01:20:48,669 --> 01:20:50,296
I'll be back.

669
01:22:43,484 --> 01:22:45,577
I'm coming for you.

670
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,655
Come on, Marcus.

671
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:33,891
Kyle.

672
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,201
Okay.

673
01:26:22,436 --> 01:26:24,870
Signal broadcasting
at full strength, sir.

674
01:26:25,038 --> 01:26:29,839
- Good. Commence bombing of Skynet.
- We have a green light to attack.

675
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:32,535
This is Bakersfield.
That's a no-go on your last. Out.

676
01:26:32,713 --> 01:26:34,305
Eugene, standing down.

677
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:35,880
This is Reno. Negative on your last.

678
01:26:36,049 --> 01:26:39,018
Eugene, Reno, Bakersfield.
They're all standing down.

679
01:26:39,186 --> 01:26:43,020
They will not attack
unless Connor gives the order.

680
01:27:10,217 --> 01:27:11,912
Kyle Reese?

681
01:27:12,085 --> 01:27:15,885
Get to the transport! Go!
Is Kyle Reese here?

682
01:27:36,276 --> 01:27:38,369
Welcome home. Marcus.
,

683
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:39,569
We knew you'd be back.

684
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:42,912
After all, it was programmed in you.

685
01:27:44,351 --> 01:27:48,754
Oh. And you executed
that programming beautifully.

686
01:27:48,922 --> 01:27:50,583
What am I?

687
01:27:50,757 --> 01:27:55,126
You are an infiltration prototype.
The only one of your kind.

688
01:27:55,295 --> 01:28:00,028
We resurrected you, advanced
Cyberdyne's work, amended it.

689
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,565
You're dead.

690
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:06,866
Calculations confirm Serena Kogan's
face is the easiest for you to process.

691
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,940
We can be others if you wish.

692
01:28:11,611 --> 01:28:14,739
Marcus, what else could you be...

693
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:16,576
...if not machine?

694
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:19,084
A man.

695
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:21,550
The human condition
no longer applies to you.

696
01:28:21,721 --> 01:28:23,916
Accept what you already know.

697
01:28:24,091 --> 01:28:27,060
That you were made
to serve a purpose.

698
01:28:27,627 --> 01:28:31,586
To achieve what no other machine
has achieved before.

699
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:38,929
To infiltrate, find a target, and then
bring that target back home to us.

700
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:45,101
We've been at war since
before either of us even existed.

701
01:28:45,412 --> 01:28:48,939
You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.

702
01:28:49,116 --> 01:28:51,243
You get me in.

703
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:53,950
You tell me
where I can find Kyle Reese.

704
01:28:54,154 --> 01:28:56,588
- Yeah?
- I will.

705
01:29:00,694 --> 01:29:03,595
Kyle Reese! Kyle Reese!
Move! Move!

706
01:29:04,498 --> 01:29:06,295
Kyle Reese!

707
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,597
Get to the transports!

708
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:10,133
- Kyle Reese?
- No.

709
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,869
You! Move!

710
01:29:19,112 --> 01:29:23,344
In times of desperation, people will
believe what they want to believe.

711
01:29:23,517 --> 01:29:27,647
And so, we gave them
what they wanted to believe.

712
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:31,655
A trick, in the form of a signal the
Resistance thought would win the war.

713
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:35,022
And they were right,
it will end this war.

714
01:29:35,195 --> 01:29:38,460
Except that it is the Resistance
that will be terminated.

715
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,026
Not Skynet.

716
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:49,973
Get the attack
on Skynet Central back online.

717
01:29:50,143 --> 01:29:52,907
I want our aircraft in the sky
immediately.

718
01:29:53,079 --> 01:29:56,173
Sir. Sir, we've got a bogey
with a very large radar signature...

719
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:58,510
...closing in on our position.

720
01:30:08,995 --> 01:30:10,155
Losenko?

721
01:30:15,835 --> 01:30:17,928
We have destroyed ourselves.

722
01:30:18,572 --> 01:30:22,599
Skynet tracked our signal.
We led them straight to us.

723
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:39,252
Our best machines had failed
time and again to complete a mission.

724
01:30:39,426 --> 01:30:43,260
Something was missing.
We had to think. Radically.

725
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:48,299
And so we made you. We created
the perfect infiltration machine.

726
01:30:49,769 --> 01:30:51,259
You, Marcus.

727
01:30:51,471 --> 01:30:55,100
You did what Skynet has failed to do
for so many years.

728
01:30:56,142 --> 01:30:57,803
You killed John Connor.

729
01:31:58,505 --> 01:32:00,473
Kyle!

730
01:32:01,041 --> 01:32:02,474
Hey!

731
01:32:11,718 --> 01:32:13,686
Don't fight, Marcus.

732
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:15,949
Remember what you are.

733
01:32:17,057 --> 01:32:19,218
I know what I am.

734
01:32:32,038 --> 01:32:33,528
I'm better this way.

735
01:32:33,707 --> 01:32:36,642
You will not be given
a second chance.

736
01:32:36,810 --> 01:32:41,304
- You cannot save John Connor.
- Watch me.

737
01:33:10,744 --> 01:33:12,211
Got a message from Connor.

738
01:33:12,846 --> 01:33:14,780
He's in Skynet, needs air support.

739
01:33:17,117 --> 01:33:20,245
Let's go. Scramble aircraft!

740
01:33:22,956 --> 01:33:26,084
Star! Star, go!

741
01:33:33,933 --> 01:33:35,059
Star!

742
01:33:35,268 --> 01:33:38,465
Star! Star! Come on. Come on.

743
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:02,960
- What's your name?
- Kyle Reese.

744
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:10,228
Stay with me.

745
01:34:30,156 --> 01:34:31,487
Back!

746
01:34:34,994 --> 01:34:36,484
Back!

747
01:34:46,873 --> 01:34:49,205
Come on, Star, move! Move!

748
01:35:16,636 --> 01:35:18,501
T-800s.

749
01:35:19,138 --> 01:35:21,368
There's so many of them.

750
01:35:40,527 --> 01:35:42,017
Careful.

751
01:35:46,332 --> 01:35:48,732
- What are these?
- Fuel cells.

752
01:35:48,902 --> 01:35:51,894
Life source for the T-800.

753
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:55,502
Nuclear.

754
01:35:56,576 --> 01:35:58,339
Enough to level this place.

755
01:36:00,847 --> 01:36:01,939
Cover us.

756
01:36:03,349 --> 01:36:04,941
Get ready.

757
01:36:08,922 --> 01:36:10,719
This is it.

758
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,471
Run!

759
01:36:37,116 --> 01:36:39,050
Star, come on! Let's go!

760
01:36:40,453 --> 01:36:42,114
Get in.

761
01:36:45,224 --> 01:36:46,987
Come on!

762
01:36:50,229 --> 01:36:52,891
We gotta get to the transport.

763
01:36:57,804 --> 01:36:59,738
- Where are you going?
- I gotta end this.

764
01:36:59,906 --> 01:37:01,635
No, no. I'm not gonna leave you!

765
01:37:01,808 --> 01:37:04,743
- You didn't.
- Who are you?

766
01:37:05,578 --> 01:37:07,102
John Connor.

767
01:40:15,368 --> 01:40:18,826
Hey! Hey, John Connor's in there.
He's still in there.

768
01:40:19,005 --> 01:40:20,939
Chris, she's hypovolemic,
start a line!

769
01:40:21,107 --> 01:40:22,870
- What?
- John Connor's in there.

770
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:24,868
Come with me.

771
01:40:44,030 --> 01:40:45,520
Connor!

772
01:40:49,402 --> 01:40:51,233
Connor, help!

773
01:40:52,138 --> 01:40:53,571
Help!

774
01:40:54,907 --> 01:40:56,966
Connor, it's Kyle. Help!

775
01:41:55,801 --> 01:41:59,794
Do it! You son of a bitch!

776
01:42:27,166 --> 01:42:29,498
Come on!

777
01:42:33,806 --> 01:42:35,831
Come on!

778
01:42:59,465 --> 01:43:00,864
Come on!

779
01:43:51,751 --> 01:43:53,742
Let's get out of here.

780
01:44:11,337 --> 01:44:13,100
John.

781
01:44:17,443 --> 01:44:22,278
We can't make it back to base.
Set this down in the nearest safe zone.

782
01:44:28,287 --> 01:44:31,688
Medevac, urgent.
Severe chest trauma.

783
01:44:31,857 --> 01:44:36,453
Call the surgical team.
Remarks: it's Connor.

784
01:45:53,873 --> 01:45:55,704
How long?

785
01:45:59,111 --> 01:46:01,204
His heart...

786
01:46:02,948 --> 01:46:04,108
...can't take it.

787
01:46:04,283 --> 01:46:07,650
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, Kate.

788
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,651
Kyle?

789
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:24,393
Take it.

790
01:46:43,856 --> 01:46:45,915
You earned it.

791
01:47:04,276 --> 01:47:05,766
Kate?

792
01:47:11,951 --> 01:47:13,509
Take mine.

793
01:47:14,453 --> 01:47:16,080
Marcus...

794
01:47:19,625 --> 01:47:22,685
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

795
01:47:25,631 --> 01:47:27,121
This is mine.

796
01:48:24,590 --> 01:48:27,024
What is it that makes us human?

797
01:48:28,927 --> 01:48:31,691
It's not something
you can program.

798
01:48:33,098 --> 01:48:35,692
You can't put it into a chip.

799
01:48:37,536 --> 01:48:39,663
It's the strength of the human heart.

800
01:48:40,873 --> 01:48:44,809
The difference between us
and machines.

801
01:49:03,629 --> 01:49:08,896
There is a storm on the horizon.
A time of hardship and pain.

802
01:49:09,068 --> 01:49:14,233
This battle has been won, but the war
against the machines rages on.

803
01:49:14,406 --> 01:49:17,398
Skynet's global network
remains strong.

804
01:49:17,576 --> 01:49:20,136
But we will not quit...

805
01:49:20,312 --> 01:49:22,405
...until all of it is destroyed.

806
01:49:22,581 --> 01:49:28,213
This is John Connor.
There is no fate but what we make.
