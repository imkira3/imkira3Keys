2
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,310
They're here! Shinsengumi!

3
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,350
Hitokiri Battousai!

4
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,990
Where?! Where are you?!

5
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,910
Prepare yourself Shinsengumi Third
Division Captain Saito Hajime!

6
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,950
Show yourself, Battousai!

7
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,990
We won! It's Nishiki's group!

8
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,070
Are you guys from the rebel army?!

9
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,550
We've won!

10
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,870
It's begun...

11
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,310
The new era.

12
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,470
Finally...

13
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,990
Himura Battousai!

14
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,310
Do you think it ends here?

15
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,869
Although the world is about to change...

16
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,530
We all live and die by the sword.
This will never change for us.

17
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,470
Why?

18
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,460
Why am I the only one...

19
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,520
What's with this katana?

20
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,950
This was Hitokiri Battousai's...

21
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,750
And now a few words from
Admiral Aritomo Yamagata!

22
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,030
Salute!

23
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,310
At ease!

24
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,230
It has been 10 years
since the Restoration!

25
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,110
This country is now a model for
Western European countries!

26
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,940
To new trade agreements!

27
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,240
We shall make this new
government last and thrive!

28
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,190
There will be happiness
and stability all over!

29
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,830
The era of fear and violence is now over!

30
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,310
Salute!

31
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,150
Humans are weak.

32
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,300
Let us discuss this ideal.

33
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,190
Humans eventually become
what they fear, monsters.

34
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,350
For yourself.

35
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,150
For profit.

36
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,230
And for pleasure.

37
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,900
Excuse me.

38
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,750
You did well. I'm proud of you Megumi.

39
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,150
Thank you.

40
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,190
This calls for a new pin.

41
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,710
The change from man to beast.

42
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,190
You may go.

43
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,430
I know how to use humans.
One will be enough for now.

44
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,030
Which one?

45
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,870
Thank you very much!

46
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,830
Damn it!

47
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,110
Let's go!

48
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,870
Leave him!

49
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,510
That man...

50
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,030
Battousai will take care of him.

51
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,470
Banzai! Banzai!

52
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,910
Come on! How about some grilled dumplings?

53
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,910
One please!

54
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,270
He was an undercover police officer.

55
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,300
A serial killer?

56
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,110
Hitokiri Battousai again?
Why now, all of a sudden?

57
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,580
A fake.

58
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,430
What?

59
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,550
There's something wrong with
the way this man was killed.

60
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,300
What do you...?

61
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,760
This was no Battousai.

62
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,630
Oro?

63
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,310
"Hitokiri Battousai..."

64
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,910
Kamiya Kasshin Ryu?

65
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,670
You there!

66
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,430
To carry a sword, ignoring
the law against them...

67
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,500
Are you the rumored Hitokiri Battousai?

68
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,750
Oro?

69
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,150
They found a murder victim today.
Come quietly!

70
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,230
Hold on! Wait a second!

71
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,820
Shut up!

72
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,510
You're mistaken!

73
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,230
Ororo...

74
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,340
I'm a wanderer...

75
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,030
I'm merely a wandering
swordsman, that's all.

76
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,340
You understand?

77
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,150
Right, then what's with that thing?

78
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,510
This is a reverse-blade sword.

79
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,190
Reverse blade sword?

80
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,390
This sword...

81
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,070
has the blade reversed,
on the opposite side

82
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,590
reversed from the normal katana.

83
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,600
You can't kill people with this.

84
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,790
Right?

85
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,780
That's unnecessary.

86
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,060
In any case, that description...

87
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,590
It started six months ago...

88
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,790
Every time he kills, he leaves a
letter claiming responsibility.

89
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,670
Even though times have changed...

90
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,150
Oro?

91
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,910
Kanryu-sama!

92
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,230
We have a guest.

93
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,780
I thought the person who called the
police was already in custody?

94
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,150
Here, want one?

95
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,910
What about it?

96
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,840
An undercover cop was killed last night.

97
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,670
He calls himself "Battousai."

98
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,110
The ghostly samurai from 10 years ago?

99
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,470
You think he's the killer?

100
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,630
What are you storing at
the Shinbashi warehouse?

101
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,630
Warehouse?

102
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,630
Ah, no need to worry about that one.

103
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,740
We just keep all our imported goods
in that warehouse, nothing illegal.

104
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,460
Of course if you wanted to search it,

105
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,270
You would need a formal warrant.

106
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,420
Otherwise, you'll stay out of it.

107
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,310
Because it is a new era

108
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,980
Quit fucking around.

109
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,700
That samurai is long gone,
times have changed.

110
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,030
There's food!

111
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,390
Look at this hapless bunch.

112
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,190
Samurai have no choice but to
wander aimlessly in this Meiji Era.

113
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:20,360
It's a terrible time for them, and
they work for practically nothing.

114
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:26,350
And when the dogs are
hungry, they get to eat.

115
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,550
Do you still think you're a samurai?

116
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,750
I still am.

117
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,830
The government mule does not fit.

118
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,350
Be warned.

119
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,230
The police may need proof
and evidence, but not me.

120
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,270
Kanryu-sama, Megumi isn't here.

121
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,760
Wait what? Megumi ran away?!

122
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,070
Money in exchange for
information from the police.

123
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,390
So much commotion over one woman.

124
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,270
That bitch, Megumi!

125
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,150
"Don't worry!"

126
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,280
If they find out about the
opium, we're in trouble.

127
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,110
Stupid big brother

128
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,750
I know how to handle such desperate women.

129
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,470
Do you guys even understand women?

130
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,930
What'd you say punk?!

131
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,750
Shut up!

132
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,790
Return that woman to me immediately.

133
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,660
Don't touch me.

134
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,980
What'd you say?

135
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,900
I'll do it.

136
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,790
What?

137
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,310
Don't kill her Jin'ei.

138
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,630
I need that woman for her
"purification methods."

139
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,670
After that, do as you like... Battousai.

140
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,030
Aren't you the one that needs protection?

141
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,300
You must understand, if
you don't tell us...

142
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,510
well, I guess there's nothing we can do.

143
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,340
Hey there!

144
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,820
It's over there over there

145
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,710
Move! Move!

146
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,550
Are you the "Battousai"?!

147
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,750
What the-?!

148
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,390
Don't move!

149
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,950
Stop!

150
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,750
This is not sorcery.

151
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,940
Nikaidou Heiho Ryu, "Shin No Ippou"

152
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,020
Human fear is fragile.

153
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,950
When their fear is intensified,
they are unable to move.

154
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,620
Painful?

155
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,310
People with fragile hearts
are easily controlled.

156
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,830
Neko-chan!

157
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,230
Neko, nya!

158
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,980
Hey!

159
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,870
Freeze!

160
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,390
You're "Battousai"?

161
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,910
Why are you doing this?

162
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,060
The name Kamiya Kasshin
Ryu has been smeared...

163
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,750
Because of you. My father...

164
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,540
The Kamiya Kasshin Ryu left by my father!

165
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,430
What happened to your father?

166
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,720
He frowned upon the use of
swords to kill or be killed.

167
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,110
The people who took advantage
of the sword, those people!

168
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,470
Does a woman with a wooden sword
expect to stand up to me?

169
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,510
Shut up!

170
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,790
What you can do with this stick?

171
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,790
What does a sword bathed
in blood live for?

172
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,920
You will find out in the afterlife.

173
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,470
Don't forget this.

174
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,990
Who are you?

175
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,110
Just someone else.

176
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,670
You. Are you the one calling
himself, "Battousai"?

177
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,990
That scar...

178
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,030
That agility...

179
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,510
You are the legendary...

180
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,430
It doesn't work on you...

181
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,870
Run.

182
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,150
This way! This way!

183
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,709
It's the Battousai!

184
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,550
Living through this world
finally has meaning.

185
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,660
You can't get away!

186
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,070
Are you okay?

187
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,220
Battousai went this way!

188
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,710
Get him!

189
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,220
This way.

190
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,510
No, this way!

191
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,270
Oro?!

192
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,750
I'd say thanks,

193
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,750
but I was fine. I can take care of myself.
I didn't need your help.

194
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,740
Do you normally look for
trouble this early?

195
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,950
Kamiya Kaoru assistant instructor...

196
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,150
It was originally a school.

197
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,310
But my father died.

198
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,990
We had many students practicing here.

199
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,150
But six months ago, the
"Battousai" mess began.

200
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,830
This is all that's left.

201
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,230
I have to stop that man
as soon as possible.

202
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,030
Why must you do this?

203
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,310
Huh?

204
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,190
That man is stronger than you Kaoru-dono.

205
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,875
Accepting one's own strength,
and the strength of

206
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:27,190
others is an important
quality of a swordsman.

207
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,990
It is something you will come to
find naturally, through technique.

208
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,350
The reputation of one's style.

209
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,870
Is it worth risking your life
to protect such a thing?

210
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,870
"The sword is not a tool for killing."

211
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,190
To go against the human ideal
is Kamiya Kasshin Ryu.

212
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,900
Swordsmanship is the art of killing.

213
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,100
A mere wanderer...

214
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,910
would not understand my frustration!

215
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,030
"A sword that protects."

216
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,230
Well...

217
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,430
Your wounds are still fresh, so you
won't be able to fight tonight.

218
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,270
Also, I don't think your father

219
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,420
would want her daughter's life to be spent

220
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,630
so that the family style
would be protected.

221
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,780
Pardon me.

222
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,310
What a mess!

223
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,350
Is this a challenge?

224
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,340
Rurouni?

225
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,910
Oh it's you...

226
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,710
Whaddya mean "oh it's you"?

227
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,070
Myojin Yahiko-sama is more like it!

228
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,830
Quiet down.

229
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,350
Is there any breakfast?

230
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,590
Please! Give an orphan a hot
meal, so he can practice!

231
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,910
Shut up.

232
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,750
Practice was earlier.

233
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,910
Kaoru: Clean up!
Yahiko: Come on...

234
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,270
What do you guys want?

235
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,950
To buy this dojo.

236
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,550
What'd you say?

237
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,590
I'll give you a good amount.

238
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,070
A very wealthy man wants to buy this dojo.

239
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,070
For you...

240
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,590
It's not such a bad deal.

241
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,940
What are you talking about?

242
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,150
My father's dojo is not for sale!

243
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,110
Assistant instructor dude!

244
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,100
You're quite the brazen woman aren't you?

245
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,750
From a school that trained a murderer!

246
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,990
Battousai has nothing to do with us!

247
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,100
Impossible!

248
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,670
This is the famous "Hitokiri" dojo!

249
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,950
No one believes you.

250
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,470
Wait! Stop it!

251
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,620
Stop that!

252
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,470
What're you punks doing?!

253
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,150
Yahiko!

254
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,310
What is this kid?

255
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,300
Samurai Myojin Yahiko of Tokyo.
Bullying is unforgivable!

256
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,430
Let the child go!

257
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,990
What are you!

258
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,950
If the boss says so, we shall!

259
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,260
That's correct!

260
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,510
The school here preaches, "you must
not take advantage of the sword."

261
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,670
And that sword there,
are you not taking advantage?!

262
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,510
Do not enter with your dirty shoes!

263
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,190
What is a sword without a human?

264
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,510
Remove your shoes!

265
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,670
A sword is not a tool for killing.

266
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,030
That is the essence of swordsmanship.

267
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,710
Bullshit!

268
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,550
You'll pay...

269
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,190
What the-?

270
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,540
Rurouni...

271
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,220
Out of the way!

272
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,180
Who're you?!

273
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,590
Certainly,

274
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,670
It's been said that the katana,

275
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,550
is merely the tool, and the person kills.

276
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,870
That makes sense does it not?

277
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,390
The sword is a weapon.

278
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,070
Swordsmanship is learning how to kill.

279
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,740
No matter how much you sugar coat it,
that is the truth.

280
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,590
I believe that is the truth.

281
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,750
But what Kaoru-dono is saying,

282
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,150
I kind of like that idea better.

283
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,110
Get him!

284
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,620
The style of Hitokiri Battousai
is Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu.

285
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,190
It is a style meant to fight many.

286
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,230
As long as it's this sword.

287
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,750
None of you will die.

288
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,420
You!

289
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,430
You're...

290
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,340
Kaoru-chan!

291
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,910
Did something happen?!

292
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,390
They're dead!

293
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,830
Wait a minute!

294
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,270
What happened... was that?

295
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,380
Is he the killer?!

296
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,430
You're mistaken!

297
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,590
These people were vandals!

298
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,940
But everything's fine.

299
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,750
No one was killed. Just unconscious.

300
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,590
Over here!

301
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,790
What happened here?!

302
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,830
Don't you guys know it is
forbidden to wear swords!

303
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,150
Arrest them!

304
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,470
What happened?

305
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,790
Don't blame them.

306
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,270
I am a wanderer and I happened to pass by.

307
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,470
This dojo has nothing
to do with any of this.

308
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,460
Let's go!

309
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,500
Hold it!

310
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,630
Rurouni-san...

311
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,350
What is it?

312
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,820
Tell me your name.

313
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,670
Ororo!

314
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,980
Wait a minute!

315
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,350
Himura Kenshin.

316
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,790
Out of the way!

317
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,870
Kenshin?

318
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,350
Heart of Sword?

319
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,750
Shut the fuck up!

320
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,550
A newbie!

321
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,020
Walk quickly!

322
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,740
Open!

323
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,950
The man with the cross-shaped scar.

324
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,790
It was you.

325
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,470
It's been awhile.

326
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,590
Hitokiri Battousai.

327
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,850
It's been 10 years since the
battle at Toba Fushimi.

328
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,460
What's your story?

329
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,100
Retired?

330
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,040
Hitokiri Battousai...?

331
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,870
It's been a long time,
where have you been?

332
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,070
Yamagata-san!

333
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,870
I suppose your disappearance
in the last decade

334
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,550
is testament to your devotion
to "never killing again."

335
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,060
What?

336
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,950
This man?

337
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,070
That was a different era.

338
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,750
I wanted a better country.

339
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:22,910
Now, it is Fujita Goro's job to protect.

340
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,590
What do you want with me?

341
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,430
These things are purchased openly.

342
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,750
Known as "Spider's Web"

343
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,270
Looks ordinary, but its contents
are completely different.

344
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,590
We've come across them a few times now.

345
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,950
Opium will destroy a nation.

346
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,790
Even the Kano Dynasty was
unable to stop opium.

347
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,070
Some of the land became
colonies of England.

348
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,270
I am only a wanderer.

349
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,750
Why're you telling me this?

350
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,150
If they can make this,

351
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,790
no doubt they are planning
something bigger.

352
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,150
Lend me your strength.

353
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,470
In return, you will have a
key position in the Army.

354
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,639
Use the strength in these arms once more.

355
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,930
I have no intention of
becoming "hitokiri" again.

356
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,990
"Hitokiri" huh?

357
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,710
That's it? This is for the Restoration!

358
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,720
Have you become a fool?

359
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,230
What is this joke of a katana?

360
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,510
How does one protect
people without killing?

361
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,870
With this sword...

362
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,830
I'm able to protect those around me.

363
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,190
Show me.

364
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,390
Because those words are just words
unless you can protect yourself.

365
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,659
I won't draw my sword.

366
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,700
Screw you!

367
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,590
Reverse your sword,

368
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,070
or I will make you suffer.

369
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,230
It was like this...

370
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:42,800
Do you remember those days?

371
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,150
That was me in the past,

372
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,110
I don't kill anymore.

373
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,150
Forget it!

374
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,710
I'm sorry.

375
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,830
It's okay.

376
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,150
Let him go.

377
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,350
Hey Kaoru?

378
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:34,990
Kaoru!

379
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:35,870
Oh!

380
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,590
Hey! Are you okay?!

381
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,230
Please help!

382
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,590
I'm being chased!

383
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,060
Please...

384
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,300
Kaoru-dono...

385
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,510
You have nowhere to go, right?

386
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,870
Come with me.

387
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,350
Because you helped me.

388
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,070
I understand.

389
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,229
But I'm the "hitokiri"...

390
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,950
I don't know who that is.

391
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,270
The person I met,

392
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,110
was a wanderer named Kenshin.

393
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,590
Everyone has a past they wish to erase.

394
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,710
Right?

395
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,110
Here.

396
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,270
Take it!

397
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,270
Let's go!

398
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,550
Hurry!

399
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,630
Let's go!

400
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,230
Come inside.

401
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,910
Excuse me.

402
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,270
Yahiko

403
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,910
Myojin Yahiko, sometimes
I teach him fencing.

404
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,070
And kind of stays here.

405
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,510
Only because you have no other students.

406
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,110
He has a bad mouth. But
he has a good heart.

407
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,430
Shut up! I'm going to be strong!

408
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,950
I know I know.

409
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,390
Kenshin will be staying
with us from today.

410
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,110
Well, I'm the sempai then!

411
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,110
Nice to meet you.

412
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:33,030
Hey! Introduce me too!

413
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,660
Who are you?!

414
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,590
She was soaking wet so
I let her take a bath.

415
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,329
Without asking me?!

416
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,990
Hey, who's the gentlemen over there?

417
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,350
Wait! Wait-!

418
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,150
A wanderer, Kenshin.

419
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,990
Oh you!

420
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,250
I heard it from this child

421
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,790
Nice to meet you, I am Takani Megumi.

422
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,830
Nice to meet you.

423
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,430
I brought you a change of clothes.

424
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,350
You didn't have to.

425
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,230
These were my fathers,

426
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,870
they are all I have left from when I
was a child, but they should fit.

427
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,780
Wait...

428
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,350
Is the color too much?

429
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,710
No... It's fine.

430
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,510
"A sword that protects."

431
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,470
Welcome!

432
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,390
By the way...

433
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,070
Why are you here?

434
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,870
Oh, she seems to be bothered by my words.

435
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,670
There's not a lot of people
in this area, right?

436
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,310
Where's your home? Where are you from?

437
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,460
Secret!

438
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,710
"Mysterious Beauty" sounds nice, right?

439
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,350
Anyway.

440
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:30,910
Here you go.

441
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,110
Oh, thanks.

442
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,630
I want to thank you for helping me.
Eat as much as you want.

443
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,990
Okay.

444
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:49,830
Delicious.

445
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,390
Isn't it?

446
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,790
Hot! Hot!

447
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,990
Eat carefully!

448
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,340
I know!

449
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,860
Kaoru-chan

450
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,400
Things are tough at the dojo, huh?

451
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,540
Tae-san...

452
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,270
Let me know if we can help.

453
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,830
Everyone around here

454
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,590
will help you no matter what happens.

455
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,670
Welcome!

456
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,270
Welcome!

457
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,230
Takeda Kanryu!

458
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,780
He's the wealthy merchant who
owns a mansion at the edge of town.

459
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,470
Where is the kitchen?

460
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,910
Over there

461
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:36,910
Kanryu-sama!

462
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,870
Please excuse me for
interrupting your meal.

463
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:52,670
Aren't you the person who beat
up the 10 thugs at a nearby dojo?

464
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,910
I am a businessman.

465
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,430
Hey.

466
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,140
We'll be straightforward.

467
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,270
We want to hire you with this money

468
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:17,470
We can hire 10 people with that.
That's 10 times the amount for one.

469
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,830
What do you think? Want
to be our body guard?

470
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,390
I must refuse.

471
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,990
Is this not enough?

472
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,310
I see.

473
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,150
You're "the samurai who hasn't eaten,
yet picks his teeth"

474
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,270
That's all fine!

475
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,350
But in the Meiji Era,
money is everything!

476
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,310
Unfortunately I don't value such pride.

477
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,870
Unlike this man here.

478
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,150
I do not take such valuables so lightly,

479
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,790
that I can throw it away!

480
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,230
All it takes is one walk
down the red-light district,

481
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,430
and you could lose your wife
or even your daughters!

482
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,270
I am merely trying to free this world
of samurai and catch all bandits!

483
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,470
That life may be fine for samurai.

484
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,670
To have fun,

485
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,310
and live,

486
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,780
remember this.

487
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,750
You're being very rude.

488
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,990
You would throw away my money?!

489
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,910
Then give me the money.

490
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,350
Sanosuke-san?

491
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,710
Wa-Wait!

492
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,470
You can hire me.

493
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,700
What are you?

494
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,830
Sagara Sanosuke of the Brawlers.

495
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,870
Fishing for money straight out of jail?

496
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,460
Are you worth this much money?

497
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,030
Are those arms?

498
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,500
I'll give it a shot,
against the legendary "hitokiri."

499
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,830
Himura Battousai-san

500
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,390
Eh?!

501
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,710
How about a fight so they can hire me?

502
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,510
This is not the place.

503
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,540
Meet me outside.

504
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,670
Oh! I've been waiting for this!

505
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,118
Come out and watch everyone!

506
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:56,210
They are going to fight!
Come out and watch everyone!

507
01:00:56,211 --> 01:00:57,910
They are going to fight!

508
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,950
This guy here,

509
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,470
is a horse killing sword called Zanbato.

510
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,440
It's an antique from the Onin Wars.

511
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:18,790
It doesn't look like you share my tastes.

512
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,790
However...

513
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,590
It can still crush you.

514
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,230
Get over here!

515
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,630
Himura Battousai!

516
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,870
Assassin for the Ishin Shishi Faction,

517
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:59,260
A killer from the age of 14 to 19.

518
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,390
I've been waiting for this for 10 years!

519
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,190
That's good!

520
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,750
You're in!

521
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,460
Out of the way! Move!

522
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,670
I will not draw my sword.

523
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,150
You'll need your sword to fight me!

524
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,660
You will not touch me
with that huge sword.

525
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,750
Why is that?!

526
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,150
There is no reason to adjust the sword.

527
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,070
That man...

528
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,430
You would fight for a man like him?

529
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,390
Kanryu: What is it?! What's going on!

530
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,590
What's happening over there?!

531
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,230
What are you doing, Brawler?

532
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,150
Hurry up and finish him!

533
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,550
Shut up!

534
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,510
You don't tell me how to
fight from where you are!

535
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,630
Is it over?

536
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,180
Oh well.

537
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,230
I'd probably end up back
at the police station.

538
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,910
The trouble is over folks!

539
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,950
Hey everyone back to the store!

540
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,590
The show is over!

541
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,750
It's over, it's over!

542
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,110
I'll be back!

543
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,870
I ran into trouble.

544
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,590
Let's eat.

545
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,870
We should not be wasteful.

546
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,910
He's the real deal.

547
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,710
You have done well

548
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:40,630
Battousai is not someone
that can be bought.

549
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,860
Your pleasure!

550
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,790
I need blood!

551
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,350
I need more blood!

552
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,100
I still thirst for more!

553
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,820
I thirst for Hitokiri Battousai!

554
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,150
The work of the fake battousai again...

555
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:32,150
He kills people, policemen,
which side is he on?

556
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,830
Once you become a murderer,
there's no turning back.

557
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,030
That is the life of a "hitokiri."

558
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,070
Please, go ahead of me.

559
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,110
Huh?

560
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,030
Let's go

561
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,030
Hold on!

562
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,220
I got it!

563
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,190
Those men who attacked the dojo,

564
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,710
You should have killed them back then.

565
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,630
The trick is to kill them,

566
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,550
So that the cops don't get
mixed up in all this.

567
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,590
I wonder if that reversed-blade sword,

568
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,070
really does protect people!

569
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:32,870
Out of the way!

570
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,390
Out of my way!

571
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:32,830
An assassin for the sake of a new era.

572
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,350
Beyond the life that was sacrificed

573
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,990
So that everyone can live in peace

574
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,180
The dawn of a new era.

575
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,200
Still the world is
At a time like this...

576
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,110
Do not mention the Shugen!

577
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,670
Sorry

578
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,150
Is it not good enough?

579
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,670
Such a happy person!

580
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,630
He's just jealous!

581
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,710
What?

582
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,660
Who goes there? Identify yourself!

583
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,270
Are you "Battousai"?

584
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,310
You damn spy!

585
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,910
Yourself!

586
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,710
I don't want to die!

587
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,990
I can't die!

588
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:27,910
There are people who are important to me
I'm not going die!

589
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:45,230
I can't die yet!

590
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,790
People are important...

591
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,110
Can not die...

592
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:41,070
I must not die!

593
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,070
To kill the young man
responsible for the future

594
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,670
What will this assassination
bring for the new era?

595
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,630
Was I correct?

596
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,930
"You're just a murderer."

597
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,190
Kenshin!

598
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,430
Kaoru-dono?

599
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:23,630
You didn't come back,
I thought something happened.

600
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,460
I didn't know if you had gone somewhere.

601
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,150
I'm hungry all of a sudden.

602
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,430
Wonderful!

603
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,300
I didn't think such a thing existed.

604
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,190
And, what of our plans?

605
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,270
Everything has been arranged.

606
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,310
I'm wasting my time around this harbor.

607
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,190
Where shall I smuggle opium next?

608
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,710
All over Japan!

609
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:51,630
No!

610
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,550
All over the world!

611
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,590
What is the best way to
siphon money from opium?

612
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,310
Replace the weapons!

613
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,270
A Kanryu Empire!

614
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,910
That will be the new government!

615
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,630
It's time...

616
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,270
...to awaken the battousai.

617
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,820
Megumi.

618
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,710
For you to be in such a place...

619
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,460
The one who had the method
of purifying opium.

620
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,550
Together. No...

621
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,430
A common "opium" dealer.

622
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,950
Maybe I should tell your friends,

623
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,500
Be careful.

624
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,790
Megumi made food!

625
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,310
Kenshin is making soup. And the fish...

626
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,670
The fish made by Kaoru.

627
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,830
This is good training eh?

628
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,590
It's good to marry a woman who can cook.

629
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,790
He'll be taken...

630
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,580
Hey you!

631
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,990
Honestly...

632
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,740
I'm too busy looking for disciples.

633
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,670
Especially when this child is incapable
of washing his own hands.

634
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,430
Better get in line!

635
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,750
Now now Kaoru-dono, you too Yahiko.

636
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,790
Come get some food.

637
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,870
Hey! Kaoru-chan!

638
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,710
Someone! Is anyone there?

639
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,030
Kaoru-chan!

640
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,630
Help!

641
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,550
Her body suddenly began to shiver!

642
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,520
She has a hard time breathing!

643
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,070
What about a doctor?

644
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:11,460
I've asked everyone,
I couldn't find one since yesterday.

645
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,190
Do you have any idea what this is?

646
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,230
Hey!

647
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,060
Be careful.

648
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,070
This dojo will suffer!

649
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,969
Kaoru-chan! Kaoru-chan!

650
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:54,790
Help!

651
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,430
Kaoru-chan!

652
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:57,990
Help Kaoru-chan!

653
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,110
What's wrong?

654
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,950
Her stomache has been
burning since this morning!

655
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,310
One of the servants fell too.

656
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,190
Where?

657
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,100
What's going on?!

658
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,070
Such a horrible disease!

659
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:24,790
Hey!

660
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,910
Someone call a doctor quick!

661
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,470
I'm a doctor

662
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,590
She has a high fever.

663
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,150
Or toxic rodenticide

664
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:43,470
What?

665
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,150
Poison? Are you certain?

666
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,040
Hurry! If I don't extract
the poison quickly!

667
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,710
But the well water is no good!

668
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,870
It's potentially toxic as well!

669
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,230
Go to the herbal shop,
and buy some castor!

670
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,230
Kettle with the same towel

671
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,030
You!

672
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,910
Go to Mizuya and buy as
much water as you can!

673
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,990
Kaoru-san! Is there an
herbalist in the next town?

674
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,190
There is!

675
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,150
Bring me the medicine I need.

676
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,430
Detoxification treatment, and quickly!

677
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,670
Kenshin: Understood!
Kaoru: Right!

678
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,350
I've got some water! Do
you guys have any water?!

679
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,350
Hang in there! Do your best!

680
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,630
It's cured.

681
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,750
This is unforgivable.

682
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,790
What if they had died.

683
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,270
Megumi-dono.

684
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,430
I think it's time you told me the truth.

685
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,960
Did you say Takani-san?

686
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,830
Do you know Megumi-san?

687
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:04,990
You know her?

688
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,790
I don't know her,

689
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:11,550
But any living doctor would know
the name Takani.

690
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,100
Takani Family,

691
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:19,070
is a venerable family of
doctors that span generations.

692
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,790
But ever since the Aizu War,

693
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:27,470
I heard that everyone in
the family was killed.

694
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,670
That's that.

695
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,390
The little girls are safe.

696
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,750
You, you're the man slayer right?

697
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,030
Before asking people about the truth,

698
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,750
I wonder if there is another
here who should speak.

699
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:16,430
I am sure those hands have
deprived many of their lives.

700
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,870
That scar?

701
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,030
Are you proud of it?

702
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,550
Perhaps it's some kind of medal.

703
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,150
This scar...

704
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,590
Belongs to a young samurai.

705
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,070
And the other scar,

706
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:04,430
The wife of a man I killed.

707
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,630
I have many others.

708
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,030
I've taken many lives...

709
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:20,070
I'm different from you.

710
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,420
I have no family or relatives.

711
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,110
I worked for Kanryu.

712
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,630
Became his woman.

713
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:54,430
Just to use each other.

714
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,950
He sells opium for the money,

715
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,270
I do it to survive.

716
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,590
To survive.

717
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:36,510
Please give me opium!
Please!

718
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,270
No way!

719
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,660
Pipe down!

720
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,910
Kanryu is holed up in his
mansion with 250 guards.

721
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,510
Most haven't fought since the Restoration.

722
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:05,190
You have my fists.

723
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,910
I'll go with you.

724
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,030
Kenshin!

725
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,590
Kenshin, look at this!

726
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,670
Megumi-san isn't here!

727
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,020
Don't tell me...

728
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,180
I'm going too!

729
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,030
Kaoru-dono must stay here.

730
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:17,310
This is no concern for the
head of Kamiya Kasshin Ryu.

731
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:18,310
But...

732
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:21,030
We'll be fighting all night.

733
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:25,630
Make sure to have breakfast ready for us.

734
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,180
I'm also going!

735
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:28,870
Wait!

736
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,910
You'll only be a nuisance.

737
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:35,630
Shut up!

738
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,670
Yahiko!

739
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,590
You will remain in the dojo.

740
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:44,990
What?

741
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,350
Protect the dojo with Kaoru-dono.

742
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,750
Of course...

743
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,700
I knew you'd come back.

744
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,710
You can't return home,

745
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,110
because you belong here.

746
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,870
Now, tomorrow...

747
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,670
I didn't come back,

748
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,910
to make more opium.

749
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:05,750
Huh?

750
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,110
I came to kill you!

751
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,590
Don't worry!

752
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,310
We will do down together!

753
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,390
I'll die soon enough!

754
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,270
What are you guys waiting for?!

755
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,830
Stop this at once.

756
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,510
I will atone for my sins!

757
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,700
This bitch!

758
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,350
This is how you treat me?!

759
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,510
They've come.

760
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,470
It's him.

761
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,190
Takeda Kanryu!

762
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,950
Hey there!
I'm here to kick some ass.

763
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,910
Come out here now!

764
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,590
Himura Battousai!

765
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,340
Megumi-dono!

766
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,510
I'm paying you all to kill
anyone who enters the premises!

767
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,750
What's wrong with you idiots?!

768
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,710
What're you talking about?!

769
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,990
There's no need to hesitate!

770
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:49,550
Do it!

771
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,670
Look!

772
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:06,100
Kill him! There's plenty
of money to go around!

773
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,990
Get your money!

774
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:15,590
I'll pay the man who defeats them
any amount of money!

775
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,430
Kill them!

776
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,630
I don't get it!

777
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:49,630
Why?! What reason does the Battousai
have for coming after me?

778
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:54,470
He needs no reason.
This is who he has become.

779
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,830
As a fellow patriot of the
Isshin Shishi Faction.

780
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:02,980
Is that so?

781
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:08,670
It's time!

782
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,470
For "that"? But!

783
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,910
No more questions!

784
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:16,430
This is merely business!
Kill or be killed!

785
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,430
Grab the woman!

786
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,140
He does this for you.

787
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,030
Where's that squid with glasses?

788
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,630
I'll find him.

789
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,670
Which one of you is my opponent?

790
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:14,990
I'm your opponent!

791
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:30,900
Fist to fist?
It's the brawler's turn!

792
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,310
Hurry, go!

793
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,830
Apologies!

794
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,990
So you're the Battousai?

795
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,830
Where is Megumi-dono?

796
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:02,470
Is that woman worth your help?

797
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,790
No human is beyond help.

798
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,990
Such a worthy reason.

799
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:10,150
And you?

800
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,500
Why sell your soul to Kanryu?

801
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:17,100
Soul?

802
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:21,180
I believe you guys used to be samurai.

803
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,630
What a stupid notion.

804
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,670
To not eat,

805
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:52,390
because men like us
have no place in times of peace.

806
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,870
Hey there! Hey!

807
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:34,950
Kenshin! Are you okay?!

808
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:57,070
Die!

809
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:28,390
What is that katana?

810
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:36,950
My vow never to kill.

811
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:39,790
My "sakaba" sword.

812
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:54,630
Hey! Where you going?!

813
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:20,990
Hold on! Wait!

814
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:23,870
Why am I waiting?!

815
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:34,190
You want to eat some too?

816
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,190
Here!

817
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,350
I'm a vegetarian Poor thing

818
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,020
Do you drink?

819
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:49,860
Give me.

820
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:30,340
You have to kill people to survive
you can't do that with a "sakaba" sword!

821
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:31,750
Don't give me that bullshit!

822
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,110
Fight with everything!

823
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,100
Head to head!

824
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:24,350
It was fun!

825
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:27,710
[Sagara Suplex!]

826
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:58,030
You're finally getting serious.

827
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:24,070
What is this vow not to kill?

828
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:28,030
Do you think you can end this fight
without killing me?

829
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,180
I'll show you.

830
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:31,900
Just try!

831
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:15,550
Looks like it was a flashy fight.

832
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:20,070
Let us go.

833
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:22,590
Wait...

834
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:27,590
This duel isn't over!

835
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,110
Fight!

836
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,070
This duel is over.

837
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:11,030
Welcome!

838
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:11,830
Yes

839
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,390
Light!

840
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:17,150
Yes

841
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:18,540
Sanosuke!

842
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:28,750
Maybe the tobacco is making me slow eh?

843
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,500
That one? You're not the one
I want, you messed me up!

844
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:33,508
The mother fucker!

845
01:47:33,509 --> 01:47:35,150
You're the one blabbering about stinkie!

846
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,350
Where is the legendary "hitokiri"?!

847
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,190
Don't take me so lightly!

848
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,350
If it's to bring him in, I'll lend a hand.

849
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:45,110
You-Why?

850
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:48,510
One of your friends rushed to the police.

851
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,110
Yahiko?

852
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,150
Over here!

853
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:55,470
Look...

854
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:01,190
A gun like that only works
in one direction.

855
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:03,830
The other side is the blind spot.

856
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,190
Hey! Come out!

857
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:09,030
Welcome! Welcome!

858
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:10,710
What're you doing?!

859
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:12,550
You've got me!

860
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:15,030
I surrender!

861
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:18,070
Hey hey! Don't shoot!

862
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:22,030
You've already won.

863
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:23,710
Right, Kenshin?

864
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,380
Just get out here, we can't win.

865
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:36,550
I surrender.

866
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,590
Put the katana down.

867
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:10,110
Now apologize,

868
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:12,590
and bow down to me.

869
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:17,580
Take them off!
Take off all your clothes!

870
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,790
And bow down to me!

871
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,790
Not in this lifetime!

872
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,270
Damn you!

873
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:38,420
Shoot me!

874
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:39,790
Fire fire fire!

875
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,590
Shoot shoot more and more!

876
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,510
Damn you!

877
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:22,460
Do you know what money can't buy?

878
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:34,660
What you have now...

879
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,150
Life.

880
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:48,820
Stop it!

881
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:59,020
So finally we get to kick your ass!

882
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,830
I'll take it from here.
Go!

883
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:10,870
Apologies!

884
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:29,350
Megumi-dono!

885
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,870
Sorry we're late.

886
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:35,590
It's all right now.

887
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,150
Are you okay?

888
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:42,710
You must hurry! Kaoru-san is-!

889
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:10,950
You're finally awake.

890
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:20,350
You won't break free.

891
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:24,950
I will use you as a hostage
and it'll make Battousai angry.

892
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:30,470
He'll be so angry he'll go back
to killing people like before.

893
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,470
He should be arriving any moment now.

894
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:57,700
Kenshin...

895
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,510
Are you angry?

896
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:18,830
To involve Kaoru-dono in such matters,

897
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:24,340
I could not stop myself.

898
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:26,830
Kenshin?

899
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:36,710
Excellent, Battousai!

900
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:39,830
Get angry! Even more!

901
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,140
Kaoru-dono!

902
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,950
Are you going to kill me with that katana?

903
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:47,220
Kenshin!

904
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:52,090
Did you not predict that move?

905
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:21,950
Kenshin!

906
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:29,190
Not yet!

907
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:38,030
You still haven't reverted
to the old Battousai.

908
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,110
Kaoru-dono!

909
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:57,790
A stronger version of Shin No Ippou.
I've paralyzed her lungs.

910
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:04,800
She has about 2 minutes.

911
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,060
Jin'ei!

912
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,310
There's no time.

913
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,950
Say what you have to say with your sword-!

914
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:27,790
As expected...

915
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,630
One life is enough!

916
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,710
Don't subject Kaoru-dono
to this, let her go!

917
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,030
It's too late.

918
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:40,980
There's only two ways...

919
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:43,190
Kill them.

920
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:46,670
Or kill the user of the jutsu.

921
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,790
Will you break your vow?

922
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:55,700
In that case!

923
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:51,910
Fight me, Himura Battousai!

924
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:11,270
No more games.

925
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:21,310
You want me to kill, come at me!

926
01:58:48,630 --> 01:58:51,300
[Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu, Ryu Tsui Sen]

927
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:32,030
Is this the infamous Battou-jutsu?

928
01:59:58,360 --> 02:00:02,870
Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu,
Battou-jutsu, Sou Ryu Sen.

929
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:08,230
I broke your elbow joint
and the muscles around it.

930
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:12,190
You life with the sword is over.

931
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:16,910
And...

932
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:22,390
This is the one life,

933
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:32,830
for the sake of protecting Kaoru-dono.

934
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:38,550
I once again return to being "hitokiri."

935
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:43,430
Kill

936
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:45,270
Die!

937
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,110
Stop Kenshin!

938
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:02,350
She overcame it.

939
02:01:04,240 --> 02:01:05,460
Kaoru-dono.

940
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:11,580
Please don't go back
to being a "hitokiri"!

941
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:17,620
Don't kill him!

942
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,630
You're not supposed to kill!

943
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:26,470
Kenshin...

944
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:32,220
Do you...

945
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:39,310
For those who were killed

946
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,950
Do you...

947
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:49,500
Until now...

948
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:53,590
For those you who haved helped

949
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:00,590
You cannot kill again!

950
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:08,310
You can help someone else.

951
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:11,340
Isn't that...

952
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:17,470
what...

953
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:27,510
Kenshin aimed for in the new world?

954
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:45,030
Kaoru-dono...

955
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:56,230
I'll end this, Battousai.

956
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,580
That's enough.

957
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:06,710
You have no chance of winning
using only your left hand.

958
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:12,430
That won't stop me.

959
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:26,750
It is in human nature to kill.

960
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:30,980
I may not be talking to the
same person as before...

961
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:35,540
Murder is murder after all

962
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:42,190
Can you be a wanderer forever?

963
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,670
I'll see you in the depths of hell.

964
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:45,830
You do realize...

965
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:49,095
You won't be able to
bring about justice and

966
02:04:49,096 --> 02:04:50,830
security wandering
around without killing.

967
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:53,630
Can you?

968
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,190
When one person kills, resentment is born.

969
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:04,980
Just let people kill themselves.

970
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,190
Until that ideal is severed.

971
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:14,310
That is the purpose of my sword.

972
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:21,400
Pretty words, I'll give you that.

973
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:35,510
Going to wander off again?

974
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:41,910
The path of rurouni is
an escape for the weak!

975
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,230
Live by the sword die by the sword.

976
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:55,750
There is no other way for us.

977
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:14,020
There's a lot of drug trafficking!

978
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:18,500
Do not miss even one!

979
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:27,990
Don't let any of this leave the harbor!

980
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:31,550
These are all very valuable!

981
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,780
I've got money in my pocket!

982
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:38,950
Money in the pockets!

983
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:40,590
Gold over here in the pocket

984
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:43,710
Can you at least grab my shoe?!
it fell off!

985
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:44,310
Silence!

986
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:46,590
It's not difficult to walk!

987
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:49,470
I'll be back, just you wait! I'll be back!

988
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:56,510
Kenshin!

989
02:07:57,320 --> 02:07:58,350
Oh, you're awake?

990
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:00,150
Kenshin!

991
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:01,550
Where's Kenshin?

992
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:02,870
Huh?

993
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:06,030
No way!

994
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:08,310
What is it?

995
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:10,390
H-Hold on!

996
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:19,990
Oro?

997
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,070
Kenshin!

998
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:30,830
You're already up I see, Kaoru-dono.

999
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:33,470
To the very end!

1000
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:37,030
A new diet today! Kenshin
was getting groceries.

1001
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:39,310
Ah! I'm hungry!

1002
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:10,350
Welcome back, Kenshin...

1003
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:17,950
I'm back...
