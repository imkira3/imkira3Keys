1
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,509
<i>Goal!</i>

2
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,332
What was that? Ellie, did you hear that?

3
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,884
I heard it, Manny.
Whatever it is, it's miles away.

4
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,385
Peaches, are you all right?

5
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,920
Where is she?

6
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,172
No teenager is ever up early.

7
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,476
Easy warden, she's not on lockdown.

8
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,517
You two were supposed to be
responsible uncles!

9
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,819
What? I didn't see Peaches sneak off
maybe 15 or 20 minutes ago.

10
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,067
Or that she went with Louis to the falls.

11
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,320
The falls? Where the delinquents go?

12
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,493
Relax, it's just where the kids hang out.

13
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,287
No, no, it's a gateway hangout.

14
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,081
First it's the falls,
then she's piercing her trunk...

15
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,330
and the next thing you know,
she's addicted to berries.

16
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,871
Manny! You are overreacting.

17
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,335
She's not going to be
your little girl forever.

18
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,672
I know. That's what worries me.

19
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,338
Come on!

20
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,263
Louis!

21
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,721
Would you get your head out of the ground
for once and try to have a little fun?

22
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,026
I'm a molehog.
My head's supposed to be underground.

23
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:32,322
And my idea of fun isn't risking death
so that you can meet some cute mammoth.

24
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,617
Ethan isn't cute. He's hot.

25
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,412
Besides, you can't spend your whole life
playing it safe.

26
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,161
- I know I would.
- Dad?

27
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,450
There's no reason to be mad.

28
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,336
You know how I feel
about you going to the falls.

29
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,628
Especially alone.

30
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,381
She's not alone, sir.

31
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,711
You don't count, Weiner.

32
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,297
Yes, there's my place,
and you just put me in it, thank you.

33
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,377
Come on, young lady.

34
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,805
We're going home
where I can keep an eye on you.

35
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:03,471
So, should I just wait here, or...

36
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,619
Yeah, you don't scare me, Mother Nature!

37
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,956
There's nothing you can throw at me
that I can't handle.

38
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,253
I think we're almost there!

39
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,964
We had better be! I just lost the steering.

40
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,850
Has anyone seen Precious?
It's her feeding time.

41
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,012
Mom! Granny's talking about
her dead pet again.

42
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,180
Hey, paws up, everybody!

43
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,018
Paws down, Uncle, please! That is nasty.

44
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,907
Be careful, Milton,
you're going to hurt somebody!

45
00:05:58,859 --> 00:05:59,860
Bad kitty!

46
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:00,944
Rock!

47
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,176
Okay, so tell me, when exactly
will I be allowed to hang out with boys?

48
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,134
When I'm dead, plus three days.
Just to make sure I'm dead.

49
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,990
Manny, are you okay?

50
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:45,164
Get off... my face!

51
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,457
That was fun. Now, who should I eat first?

52
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,708
No, no, no!

53
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,381
Uncle Fungus! Could that really be you?

54
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,049
Sorry, Sorry.

55
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,389
Mom, Dad!

56
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,133
Marshall!

57
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,342
- Hey!
- Granny?

58
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,846
This pumpkin's ripe for picking!

59
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,685
My whole familia.

60
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,849
See? He still hugs his parents.

61
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:17,897
I never thought I'd see my little baby again.
We've been searching everywhere for you.

62
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,110
You have?

63
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,409
I knew it, I knew it!
Deep down, I knew I wasn't abandoned!

64
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,446
That's incorrect. We totally abandoned you.

65
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:30,250
But we always missed you. Right?

66
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,035
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

67
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,832
And we just knew Sid
would want to see his poor, dear Granny...

68
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,716
before her time is up.

69
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,049
I'll bury you all and dance on your graves.

70
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,259
So frail.

71
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,592
And she can't wait
to spend time with you, Sid.

72
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,183
Oh, yeah, Granny? Granny?

73
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,729
- Granny.
- I never get to have any fun.

74
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,365
Why don't you show her your cave?
Yeah, she could use a nap.

75
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,276
Boy, there's so much to tell you.

76
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,365
A lot has happened
since the last time I saw you.

77
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,780
Not interested.

78
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,415
But we fought dinosaurs in the Ice Age.

79
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,746
It didn't make sense,
but it sure was exciting.

80
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,746
We got rid of the crazy bat! Let's go!

81
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,882
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't just leave.

82
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,258
Sid will be crushed.

83
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,594
Sorry, cookie,
things are breaking apart back home.

84
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,098
So, we're headed inland.
And Granny is just dead weight.

85
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,055
- See you.
- Mush, mush!

86
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:34,272
And warn the community.
She tends to wander!

87
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,226
Well, that explains a lot about Sid.

88
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,779
Mom, Dad, do you have Granny's teeth?
She can't find them.

89
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,614
Hey! Can you chew this thing for me?

90
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,030
Guys'? Where is everyone?

91
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,699
I'll handle this.

92
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,542
Sid?

93
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,080
Your family was wiped out by an asteroid.
Sorry.

94
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,418
What?

95
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,085
What Diego is trying to say is...

96
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,094
they left.

97
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,473
They only wanted to find you
so you could take care of Granny.

98
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:13,262
Come on, what kind of sick family
would ditch their Granny on someone?

99
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,398
That's just crazy. That's just...

100
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,441
That's just...

101
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,693
...my family.

102
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,572
At least you still have Granny.
Right, buddy?

103
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,405
Yeah, Granny. Granny?

104
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:28,906
Granny?

105
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,784
Wow. For an old girl, she moves fast.

106
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,911
- Granny?
- Granny.

107
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,041
Granny?

108
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,497
Come out, come out wherever you are!

109
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,581
Come on, Granny.

110
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:46,090
Here, Granny, Granny.
I have prunes for you!

111
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,471
Just the way you like them!

112
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,301
I don't want to see that.

113
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,764
Oh, no.

114
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,017
<i>What if your dad finds out?
I'm not as tough as I look!</i>

115
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,151
Wait, do you hear that?

116
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,448
Go long!

117
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,579
Cool!

118
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,619
Hey, look, there's Ethan.

119
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,958
Yeah, Ethan!

120
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,373
You go, boy!

121
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,378
That was nice.

122
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,384
Yeah!

123
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,714
See'? Fun, no danger.

124
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,885
Check me out!

125
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,529
- I'm sure he's fine.
- I'm completely not fine!

126
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:51,072
You did not just do that! That was crazy!

127
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,576
Nice.

128
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,029
Yeah!

129
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,240
Isn't he perfect?

130
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,873
"Perfect." It's such a strong word.
Maybe "adequate."

131
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:01,999
Who are we stalking?

132
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,546
Is it Ethan? I bet it's Ethan.

133
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,248
- Hey, Weiner.
- What are you guys doing here?

134
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,753
Manny told us to keep an eye on you.

135
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,882
- But not to let you see us.
- Under any circumstances.

136
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,552
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

137
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,769
Okay, I'm going for it. Do I look okay?

138
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,095
Louis?

139
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,567
"Okay" doesn't even begin to cover it.

140
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,445
Louis. You're the greatest friend ever!

141
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,608
That's me.

142
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,028
Hi, Ethan, my name's Peaches.
What's yours'?

143
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,575
What am I doing?
Okay, just be cool, just be...

144
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,040
No!

145
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,798
Yeah. That's intense!

146
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,131
This hurts so much!

147
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,428
No! No! No!

148
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,729
Gross. It's that weirdo
who chills with possums!

149
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,938
What just happened?

150
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,897
Oh, no! Ethan, I am so sorry.

151
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,316
Wow, you're even better-looking up close.

152
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,359
Phenomenal. I mean...

153
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,949
You have a twin sister?

154
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,829
Am I interrupting something?

155
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,707
- Dad!
- Oh, boy. Okay...

156
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,874
Sorry, if I just...

157
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,169
- Wait, no, you go left.
- Just move back a bit.

158
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,338
You! Keep away from my daughter.

159
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,210
- Dad...
- And you, you're grounded!

160
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,882
- But I didn't do...
- Grounded!

161
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,380
Loser alert.

162
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,260
Ouch, that's her dad.

163
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,638
Seriously, that's embarrassing.

164
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,760
What a freak.

165
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,930
Peaches!

166
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,853
Peaches, come on. Let's talk about this!

167
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,438
How could you embarrass me
in front of my friends?

168
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,730
You deliberately went
where you weren't supposed to!

169
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,489
You can't control my life!

170
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,743
I'm trying to protect you!
That's what fathers do.

171
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,996
Well... I wish you weren't my father.

172
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,496
She's just upset, honey.

173
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,875
Peaches! It's not the end of the world.

174
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,086
Whoa. Excuse me.

175
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,596
I don't think that was you.

176
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,307
- What was that?
- I don't know.

177
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,305
Stay there.

178
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,977
I'll come to you.

179
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,533
- Ellie!
- Manny!

180
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,870
No!

181
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,657
- Dad!
- Peaches, get back!

182
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,958
Hurry, Dad! Hurry!

183
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,089
Manny!

184
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,008
- Diego!
- You never would have made it!

185
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,977
Ellie, behind you!

186
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,316
What's happening?

187
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,245
Go to the land bridge!
You'll be safe on the other side.

188
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,662
No, Manny! No!

189
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,289
I'll meet you there!

190
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,671
Manny! No!

191
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,808
Ellie, you have to get out of here!
Go! Go now!

192
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,236
- Mom!
- Get back! Get back!

193
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,851
Daddy!

194
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,522
Stay alive!

195
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:36,608
No matter how long it takes, I will find you!

196
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,114
Mom, this is all my fault.
If I had just listened...

197
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,651
Peaches! This is not your fault, okay?

198
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,071
What if I never see him again?
And the last thing we did was fight.

199
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:50,708
Hey, your father is the toughest,
most stubborn mammoth I've ever met.

200
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,871
He'll come back for us. That's a promise.

201
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,212
Come on!
Help me turn this thing around!

202
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,734
Everyone, please, settle down. Don't panic!

203
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,278
Wait, Mom, where's Louis?
We have to find him.

204
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,731
Okay, fast.

205
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,996
They need me! We got to get back.

206
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,544
Buddy, this thing's too big to turn.
The current's pulling us out.

207
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,841
You know, my mother once told me that
bad news was just good news in disguise.

208
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,509
Was this before she abandoned you?

209
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,801
Yes, it was.

210
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,006
But the point being that,
even though things look bad...

211
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,637
there's a rainbow around every corner...

212
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:53,096
and nothing but smooth sailing ahead!

213
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,396
Smooth sailing, Sid?

214
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,907
- Louis? Louis?
- Louis?

215
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,040
Weiner! Weiner! Weiner!

216
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,122
Louis where are you'?
Come on, we have to go.

217
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,291
Louis?

218
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,801
Peaches!

219
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,968
Louis, you have to jump.

220
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,179
No! Go, save yourselves.

221
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,932
We're not leaving without you.

222
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,011
Oh, thank goodness.

223
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,142
Jump!

224
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,188
This is why I travel underground.

225
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,242
Thanks for coming back.

226
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,245
What do you mean?
You don't leave a friend behind.

227
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,002
Great, let's go.

228
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,583
That wall is going to keep moving
and crush us.

229
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,840
We need to get to the land bridge.

230
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,046
Any questions?

231
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,506
Yes?

232
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:11,182
When you drink water through your trunk,
does it taste like boogers?

233
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,849
No.

234
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,303
Well, sometimes. Let's move!

235
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,660
Just keep your eye on the horizon.

236
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,205
I can't find the horizon.

237
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,709
Holy crab!

238
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,016
Hold me.

239
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,065
If I don't make it...

240
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,727
find me a wife, and tell her I love her.

241
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,662
We made it!

242
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:19,242
Come on, ocean,
is that the best you can do?

243
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,793
Am I right, buddy?

244
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,436
Hey, there really is a rainbow
around every corner!

245
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,951
Peaches!

246
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,917
You okay?

247
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,961
I'm just so worried about my dad.

248
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,842
Listen, we're going to get to him.

249
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,673
At this pace, we'll stay ahead of the wall...

250
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,009
and we'll make it to the land bridge
before you know it.

251
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,637
We're all going to survive this.

252
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,066
Okay, maybe they won't.
But everyone else, totally fine.

253
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,874
We're still heading away from home.

254
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,343
Yeah, but we survived,
and we still have each other.

255
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,844
Things could be worse, right?

256
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,766
For once, he's actually right.

257
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,186
We made it through storms
and tidal waves...

258
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,105
and a vicious assortment of seafood.

259
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,016
What more can they hit us with?

260
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,643
Trying to make me get up
if I don't want to get up.

261
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:10,774
If I want to get up I'd get up.

262
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,854
Hello?

263
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,814
What the...?

264
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,650
Dagnabbit, I'm trying to sleep!

265
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,318
Granny'? You're alive!

266
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,079
And can we say
how thrilled we are to see you?

267
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,081
Hey, fats, you want to get me out of here?

268
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,248
Hey, come on.

269
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,038
Pretend I'm a dessert,
that should motivate you.

270
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,465
I can't believe this.
You slept through that storm?

271
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,465
I slept through the comet
that killed the unicorns.

272
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,100
Thanks for drawing my bath, Sidney.

273
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,637
- Granny, grab my paw.
- No way.

274
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,689
This is my first bath in decades.

275
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,314
There's your proof.

276
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,862
Quick! Somebody do something!

277
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,945
- I got you, Granny.
- Get off of me!

278
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,405
Granny!

279
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,994
What are you peeping toms all looking at?

280
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,957
A lady can't take a bath in peace?
Eyeballing me like a rump roast.

281
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,468
What's the life expectancy
for a female sloth?

282
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,384
She'll outlive us all, you know that, right?

283
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,137
Yeah, the spiteful ones live the longest.

284
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,894
How big is this ocean?

285
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,989
<i>Water, water, everywhere</i>

286
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,197
<i>Nor any drop to drink</i>

287
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,948
Well, except maybe that drop.

288
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,917
That's a little... salty.

289
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:58,172
Precious! Mommy's calling you.

290
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,209
Precious! Come here, sweetie.

291
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,423
Hey, lady, have you seen Precious?

292
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,008
If you mean the imaginary,
or perhaps deceased, pet...

293
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,763
that you keep searching for, no, I haven't.

294
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,926
Guys, look.

295
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,763
Where there's birds, there's land, right?

296
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,268
Hey, buddy, come here.

297
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,935
No, wait, wait! Come back.

298
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,188
Come back!

299
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,285
It's a huge bounty, mon capitaine.

300
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,127
Four passengers. Ripe for the taking.

301
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,714
One very smelly, and one very plump.

302
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,799
In my ocean?

303
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,635
What a terrible turn of events.

304
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,301
I love a terrible turn of events.

305
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,566
Am I hallucinating,
or is that ice coming straight towards us?

306
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,656
Yeah, yeah, it's coming.
It sounds like there's animals on it.

307
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,243
Yippee!
We're being rescued, we're being rescued!

308
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,660
I hear laughter.

309
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,909
Must be a party cruise.

310
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,727
Hey, they look fluffy.

311
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,817
I get the big woolly one.

312
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,943
Wow.

313
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,281
Get ready to slice and dice, boys.

314
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,949
- Knock it off, Squint.
- Hey!

315
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,413
Wait for Captain's orders.

316
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,581
Ahoy, down there!

317
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,547
How lucky are you?

318
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,800
You know these waters
are infested with pirates.

319
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,506
Right, boys?

320
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,717
Glad we found you before they did.

321
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,972
Captain Gutt, here to help.

322
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,558
You know, that's a nice monkey.

323
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,104
Look, we don't want any trouble.
We just need to get back to the continent.

324
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:30,366
The continent? That pile of rubble?

325
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,408
My family's there, so if you could just...

326
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,708
Your family? That is so sweet.

327
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:43,792
I hope you said goodbye,
because there's no way back.

328
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:47,299
Yes, there is.
Don't you remember, Captain?

329
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,836
You can sail to Switchback Cove
and catch the current back from there.

330
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,222
It's like a steel trap, this noggin is.

331
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,428
Thank you, Mister Flynn.

332
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,182
See? I knew there was a way home.

333
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,641
There is no home!

334
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,308
There is only here.

335
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:08,274
And here, your ship belongs to me.

336
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,940
Battle stations!

337
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,280
Fly the colors!

338
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:25,413
Now surrender your ship or face my fury.

339
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,130
Or face your furry what?

340
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,750
NOT "furry." Fury!

341
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,339
Fire!

342
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,798
Hit the mammoth, win a prize.

343
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,009
Ding, ding, ding-

344
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,890
Fire the starboard cannons.

345
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,188
I love this job!

346
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,435
Shira, fetch.

347
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,891
Aye-aye, Captain.

348
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,730
You almost made it.

349
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,030
I don't fight girls.

350
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,032
I can see why.

351
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,539
Belly flop.

352
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,413
Sid!

353
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,494
Let's rumba, Tiny.

354
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,288
Lights out, big fella.

355
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,553
Manny!

356
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,812
Hello.

357
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,352
Hey, buddy.

358
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,475
Welcome to the party.

359
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,905
Let's see what kind of moves you got.
Dance, little Scrat fish!

360
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,657
Dance your coconuts off!

361
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,823
Happy dance.

362
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,499
Look at him.

363
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,081
Where's my bootie? Has anyone seen it?

364
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,871
Dude, it's right behind you.

365
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,960
Where? Where's my bootie?

366
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,591
I can't see it.

367
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,422
It's all I can see.

368
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:58,055
This is a lovely vacation. Best I've ever had.

369
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,136
Morning, sunshine.

370
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:04,436
Let me be the first
to extend the hand of friendship.

371
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,975
That's your foot.

372
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,103
Nothing gets by you, does it?

373
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,434
What do you want?

374
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,522
I bet you're feeling lost, scared, confused.

375
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,273
Allow me to explain.

376
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,862
Help me out, boys.

377
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,819
Captain's going to sing a shanty!

378
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,788
<i>Here you are on a boat
You're adrift, you're aﬂoat</i>

379
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,491
<i>One might even say you're stuck</i>

380
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,910
<i>Well, I don't want to gloat
But I would like to note</i>

381
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,336
<i>That you're in luck</i>

382
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,755
<i>You've been saved by the ape
That rules these waters</i>

383
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,715
<i>So forget about
Your wives and daughters</i>

384
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,003
<i>First Mate introduce me to them, please</i>

385
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,845
Aye-aye, Captain Gutt.

386
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,472
<i>- He's the big and scary
- Elegant yet hairy</i>

387
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,599
<i>- Fear-inspiring
- Years from retiring</i>

388
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,636
<i>- Looting, stealing
- Banana peeling</i>

389
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,347
<i>Undisputed Master of the Seas</i>

390
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,397
Oh, jeez.

391
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,602
<i>- That's me
-'Tis he</i>

392
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,685
Okay, okay.

393
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:58,566
<i>I'm a primate pirate pioneer
And these are my brave buccaneers</i>

394
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:01,281
<i>All of whom were once
Lost souls like you</i>

395
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,444
<i>It's true</i>

396
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,412
<i>- He rescued us
- He saved our butts</i>

397
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,411
<i>For that we owe our lives to Gutt</i>

398
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,621
<i>And assuming he doesn't kill you</i>

399
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,037
<i>You will owe him, too</i>

400
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,580
Kill them?

401
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,464
Me? No, no.

402
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:19,211
Well, at least not this
very large, useful mammoth.

403
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,800
Hey, hands off.

404
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,134
AnyWaY- ...

405
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,391
<i>Here we are on a ship
Moving at quite a clip</i>

406
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,934
<i>Through the ever-shifting ice</i>

407
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,260
<i>Come along on a trip</i>

408
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:28,391
<i>- That's a hint
- That's a tip</i>

409
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,471
<i>That's good advice</i>

410
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:34,314
<i>In a world that's going under
To survive you must learn to plunder</i>

411
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,604
<i>Luckily that's my field of expertise</i>

412
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,687
He's the best.

413
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,941
<i>- He's a robbing, thieving
- We really should be leaving.</i>

414
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,905
- Weapon throwing
- We got to get going.

415
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,069
- Sloth-slaying
- Wish we could be staying.

416
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,909
<i>Undisputed
Uncontested</i>

417
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,073
<i>- Monkey suited
- Yeah, you guessed it</i>

418
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,663
<i>Master of the seas</i>

419
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,743
Oh, please.

420
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,921
<i>- That's me
-'Tis he</i>

421
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:54,962
<i>- It's who?
- It's you</i>

422
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,085
Just testing, I knew.

423
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,417
<i>It's me</i>

424
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,843
Good shanty, sir.

425
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,755
"Captain Gutt"? Really?

426
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:06,843
I have a little paunch, too,
but I wouldn't name myself after it.

427
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,596
That's funny. You're a funny guy.

428
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,856
But that's not how I got my name.

429
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,982
These got me my name.

430
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,815
- I don't get it.
- No?

431
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,354
Okay.

432
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,859
Let me give you a visual aid.

433
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,989
I just gently press here.

434
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:26,867
- That tickles.
- And go down like this.

435
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,206
And then your innards
become your outards.

436
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:33,873
I still don't get it.

437
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,331
Look, as much as I'm tempted
to join a monkey...

438
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,385
the Easter Bunny
and a giant bag of pudding...

439
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,840
I'll pass.

440
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,047
No one's going to stop me
from getting back to my family.

441
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,342
I'm going to lambada
with your liver, buddy.

442
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,678
Let me at him!

443
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:57,310
That family is going to be the death of you.

444
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,478
First mate, jettison the deadweight.

445
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,279
Aye-aye, sir. Prepare the plank!

446
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,906
Prepare the plank!

447
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,532
Preparing the plank!

448
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,158
What?
You want me to walk into the water?

449
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:13,037
I can't because I just ate less than
20 minutes ago, and you know the rule.

450
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,459
That's a myth.

451
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,832
Okay, as long as it's safe.

452
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,291
- Wait!
- Thank goodness.

453
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,335
Dump the wench, too.

454
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,296
Ladies first.

455
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,389
Such a nice boy.

456
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,139
Why can't you be more like him, Sidney?

457
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,095
Granny, no! Wait!

458
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,559
Manny!

459
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,644
Get me to the vine.

460
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,269
Yeah, yeah, got it.

461
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,534
You all got some ugly goldfish.

462
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,445
Come on, a little more.

463
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,453
No!

464
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,753
Extinct that mammoth.

465
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,176
Come on, Manny, kick his monkey butt!

466
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,757
Look at you.

467
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,806
Eleven tons of landlubber blubber.

468
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,634
Hey, I'm not fat! I'm poufy.

469
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,812
Too bad, Tubby. I could have used you.

470
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,223
Ain't going to happen, Captain.

471
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,653
I got you, Granny.

472
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,738
Giddy up, let's go, let's go.

473
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,243
Does anyone have floaties?

474
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,172
No! No!

475
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,004
My bounty!

476
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,276
They sunk our battleship.
What are we going to do?

477
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,024
We're all going to drown.

478
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,691
You're a sea creature, you idiot.

479
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,863
Good point, sir.

480
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,736
Should I fly the white, captain?

481
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,071
No!

482
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,077
Wait, what about Shira?

483
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,250
- What about her?
- Yeah, what about her?

484
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,204
Anyone else want to play "Captain"?

485
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:22,795
Good.

486
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:26,296
Now come on, blubber-brain. Swim.

487
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:31,471
Hey! Gutt! Flynn! Anyone there?

488
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,014
Here, grab hold.

489
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,055
No, go away. I'd rather drown.

490
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,556
Whatever the lady wants.

491
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,434
I said I didn't need your help.

492
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,443
You're welcome.
So, care to join our scurvy crew?

493
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,241
Two sloths, a mammoth and a saber?

494
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,494
You guys are like the start of a bad joke.

495
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,287
And we saved you.

496
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,491
That makes you the punch line, kitty.

497
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,250
Don't call me "kitty."

498
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,078
Okay, I won't...

499
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,625
Kitty.

500
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,377
If they kiss, I'm going to puke.

501
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,925
What? Wait, no.

502
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,519
Are we there yet?

503
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,566
I don't think we're ever going to get there.

504
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,781
Maybe we should rest for a few hours.

505
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,658
Thank you.

506
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,746
Night, Ellie.

507
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,544
I miss you, Dad.

508
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,806
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.

509
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,091
Ethan!

510
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,471
Hi.

511
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,517
I meant to do that.

512
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,182
I've never seen a mammoth sleep like that.

513
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,689
What? No, this just helps me think.

514
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,735
It gets blood to the old noggin
and away from the old... whatever.

515
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,616
Okay, that's a little weird.

516
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:26,496
So, how are you doing, you know,
with all of this?

517
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,206
Honestly, a little scared.

518
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,674
Okay, a lot scared.

519
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,335
Everything we knew is gone.

520
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,170
Yeah, I was pretty scared, too.

521
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:39,099
I mean, not scared, but, like, concerned.

522
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,011
Do you want to walk with me tomorrow?

523
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,061
Try and get our minds off all this stuff.

524
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,855
You want to walk with me?

525
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,062
You did almost flatten me this morning.

526
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:51,190
So, I figure it can't
really go worse than that, right?

527
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,275
Yeah.

528
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,355
Just one thing.

529
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,909
It's totally no big deal, but
you might want to lose the molehog.

530
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,033
Louis? Yeah, sure, not a problem.

531
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,994
Wow.

532
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,379
Someone looks happy.

533
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,748
Ethan's great, isn't he?

534
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,134
Baby, I know you like this one...

535
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,047
but just don't let anyone change
who you are, okay?

536
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,590
I know.

537
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,844
You coming up?

538
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,850
I think I'm going to sleep
down here tonight.

539
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,233
Okay.

540
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,062
Night, baby.

541
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,821
Night, Mom.

542
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,694
Good night, Dad.

543
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,251
Hey, chew this sandwich for me.

544
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:57,173
Granny, why didn't our family want us?
What's wrong with us?

545
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,964
They think we're screw-ups
and we can't do anything right.

546
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,726
It's a rat!

547
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,306
No! No!

548
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,060
- Screw up.
- Oh, Sid!

549
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,109
We'll never make it home on this thing.

550
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:21,026
Maybe you should have thought of that
before you capsized our berg, genius.

551
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,281
Yeah, trying to escape.

552
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,361
- Wimp!
- Whiner!

553
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,491
- Crybaby!
- Land!

554
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,118
Yeah, land! Wait, what?

555
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,540
Not her. There!

556
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,788
Land!

557
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,997
Everyone paddle. Paddle!

558
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,691
Food! I missed you so much!

559
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,657
Look at me, I've wasted away.

560
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,208
Okay, snack time is over.
We got to build a raft.

561
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,288
Manny.

562
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,669
Wow, Shira must really hate building rafts.

563
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,585
Go get her. She can help us get back.

564
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,669
Shira!

565
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:46,991
Gotcha!

566
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,868
Whoa!

567
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,538
Let go of me.

568
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,499
Where do you think you're going?

569
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:00,750
Whoa!

570
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,379
Switchback Cove.

571
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,176
It's the way home.

572
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,303
Oh, no.

573
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,512
You call this a ship you miserable runts?

574
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,517
Yeah, you little runts. Get to work.

575
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:17,191
Faster, you worthless, wormy
sons of sorry excuses...

576
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,859
for shark bait weevils!

577
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,437
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

578
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,861
Now get this chunk of ice
seaworthy by sundown...

579
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,409
or I will keelhaul the lot of you!

580
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,159
So what do you think?

581
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,082
Two words, anger management.

582
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,326
I'm talking about the current.

583
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,913
Diego's right. We found the way home.

584
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,714
Yeah, that's great.
Too bad we don't have a ship.

585
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:46,342
Sure we do. It's right there.

586
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,515
Well, that's a flawless plan.

587
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,935
You want to pirate a pirate ship
from pirates.

588
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,769
It pains me to say this, but...

589
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,597
-our prisoner has a point.
- Yeah, well...

590
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,560
Guys. The trees have ears.

591
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,787
Wait a minute,
maybe we can help each other.

592
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,124
Hey, little fellas. Hey, come on out.

593
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,136
No, no, it's okay.
We're not going to hurt you.

594
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,849
How about you and us
against the pirates, huh?

595
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,145
You got no idea what I'm saying, do you?

596
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,808
Okay, ship, me want.

597
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,942
Yeah, nice try Jungle Jim.

598
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,024
Go ahead make fun. He got it.

599
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,868
Thank you.

600
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,199
May I try?

601
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,530
Yeah, knock yourself out.

602
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:56,787
Okay, watch this.

603
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,837
Sick sloths sip broth, sick sloths sip broth.

604
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,059
Ta-da!

605
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,357
That, they got?

606
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,947
Yup, they're in.

607
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,704
Great, we'll free your buddies
and we can all work together...

608
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,535
to kick a little pirate booty.

609
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,223
Easy, kitty. Water.

610
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,358
You need it.

611
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,774
I don't need anything from you.

612
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,528
Fine, die of thirst. That will really show me.

613
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,903
Wait.

614
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,739
I'll take it.

615
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,993
Thank you.

616
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:18,911
You have a way of saying "thank you"
that makes it sound like "drop dead."

617
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,825
It's a gift.

618
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,252
Well, you're pretty soft, for a saber.

619
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,329
Excuse me, I am not soft.

620
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,290
<i>I happen to be a remorseless assassin.</i>

621
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,000
Diego-poo!

622
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,960
Hey, I made you another coral necklace.

623
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,886
He keeps losing them.

624
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,593
Yeah, I think I'm starting to get
why you're not in a pack.

625
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,849
Listen, I chose to leave my pack, all right?

626
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,272
Congratulations, warrior princess.

627
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,394
So did I.

628
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,271
- Really?
- What?

629
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,024
Nothing, I just know how hard that is...

630
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,855
walking away from everything you know.

631
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,033
Oh, great, are we going to
braid each other's fur now?

632
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,860
Funny. Really funny.

633
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,616
Can I tell you the difference
between you and me?

634
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,447
I wouldn't still be wearing that necklace?

635
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,326
No, we both
might have wanted out of pack life...

636
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,832
but at least I didn't trade
one pack for another.

637
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,459
I got something more.

638
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,290
Oh, yeah, what's that?

639
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,792
- A herd.
- What's the difference?

640
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,211
We have each other's backs.

641
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,843
Gutt has my back. I'm his first mate.

642
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,846
Really? Because I don't see Gutt
sending out any search parties for you.

643
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,061
You know, you won't beat him.

644
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,390
Your big furry friend over there?

645
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,191
He has no idea what he's up against.

646
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,314
Yeah, but neither does Gutt.

647
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,233
Unwind the binds,
don't let go until we're all on board.

648
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:36,318
Okay, we need precision timing
from everyone to get that ship.

649
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,903
Half-pint, you got your end covered, right?

650
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,459
I'm going to take that as a "yes." Diego?

651
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,120
I'll free his little friends.

652
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:48,204
Sid and Granny?

653
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,085
Untie the ship, sir!

654
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,714
Right, unwind the vines,
and don't let go until we're all on board.

655
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,761
We're relying on you, Sid. You got that?

656
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,588
Yes, sir. Totally focused, sir.

657
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:58,764
Don't worry.

658
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,639
It'll be easy since
we don't have to guard Shira anymore.

659
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,187
We need to move, now.

660
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,268
Squint, batten down the hatches.

661
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,103
Raz, hoist the anchor.

662
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,314
And, Gupta, fly the colors.

663
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,115
Of course, Captain.

664
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,034
We're setting sail for vengeance, lads.

665
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,199
I love vengeance.

666
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:22,947
Captain!

667
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,409
Shira! Oh, what a relief!

668
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,914
I thought we'd lost you.

669
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,042
The mammoth. He washed ashore with me.

670
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,873
What? He's here?

671
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,420
Did you sink your fangs into him?
Did he beg for his life?

672
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,550
No, the saber took me down.

673
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,515
You're a failure.

674
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:46,767
I need warriors, and all I have
are kitty cats and bunny rabbits.

675
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,398
And a seal and a kangaroo.

676
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,479
You take the saber down, or you die trying.

677
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,569
No excuses.

678
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,405
Yes, Captain.

679
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,484
Mr. Squint.

680
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,615
Aye, sir.

681
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,950
You're first mate now.

682
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,950
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of
cool with me, Captain.

683
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,832
Out of my way, saber.
You answer to me now.

684
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,833
Gutt, listen, he's coming for the...

685
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,334
Grab your weapons, mates!

686
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,128
Not the spoon, Flynn.

687
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,842
Follow me!

688
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,135
Yeah, let's do this.

689
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,974
Let me at him! Yeah!

690
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,437
Guys, that's not necessary, really.

691
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,317
I love you, too, yeah.

692
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,776
Get to the ship, don't screw up.
Get to the ship, don't screw up.

693
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:22,988
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go.

694
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,151
Unwind the vines.

695
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,244
Don't let... Oh, yummo!

696
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,618
Sid, no! It's a lotus berry.

697
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:33,081
It will paralyze you.

698
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,629
Oh, please. I know my berries.

699
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,081
Don't...

700
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,211
swallow.

701
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:42,170
See, I'm fine.
If there's one thing I know, it's berries.

702
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:45,639
Uh-oh!

703
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,538
Yeah, finally!

704
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,546
Who's the Easter Bunny now?

705
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:30,472
- It worked, he bought it!
- Come on!

706
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,598
No, no!

707
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,138
It's been a diversion.

708
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,268
I know, I'm having a blast.

709
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,772
No, pinhead, they're stealing my ship.

710
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,987
One thing, Sid. You couldn't do one thing?

711
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,784
Look at you.

712
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:48,990
Sid, can you hear me?

713
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,070
Bye-bye.

714
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,872
Say something, buddy.

715
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,579
Let's get them!

716
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,168
Let's go.

717
00:49:58,579 --> 00:49:59,626
The Ship!

718
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,709
Come on, we've got to catch it
before it hits open water!

719
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,340
Sorry. All right, I'll hold you higher.

720
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,975
Sorry. Sorry.

721
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,271
Say adieu, mammoth!

722
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:16,730
<i>Adieu!</i>

723
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:17,852
Sorry, buddy.

724
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,701
I'm coming, Sid.

725
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,286
I got you! I got you! I got you!

726
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,219
I'm coming for you, mammoth.

727
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,317
Diego!

728
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,648
Come on!

729
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,399
Come on, move it!

730
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,249
Why are you doing this?

731
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,081
You don't understand. I don't have a choice.

732
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,837
You don't have to live this way, Shira.

733
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,259
You'll be safe with us.

734
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,428
- We take care of each other.
- Diego!

735
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,682
I can't hold on much longer.

736
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,557
Diego!

737
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,101
Come with us.

738
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,473
Come with me.

739
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:50,904
What are you doing?

740
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,326
I've got your back.

741
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:20,305
So long, banana breath.
Thanks for the ship!

742
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,834
Oh, no, he's gone forever!

743
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,800
Oh! There he is.

744
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,469
Shore leave is over.

745
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,806
Get your sorry carcasses on board now.

746
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,819
Gutt, I can explain.

747
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:18,703
When this ends...

748
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:22,033
I'll have a tiger's skin hanging on my wall.

749
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,791
I don't care whose.

750
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:31,167
That mammoth has taken my ship...

751
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,547
my bounty ...

752
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,505
and now the loyalty of my crew.

753
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,553
I will destroy him...

754
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,469
and everything he loves.

755
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,140
Wait for it. Wait for it.

756
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,776
That was awesome.

757
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:40,907
Can I ask you guys something?

758
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,243
How are you both so happy?

759
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,370
Doesn't it weigh on you
that the world might be ending?

760
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,243
Can I tell him our secret?

761
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,249
Come here. Come here.

762
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:54,425
We're very, very stupid.

763
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,549
But, still, you're not a teensy bit
concerned about...

764
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,260
I don't know, say, imminent death?

765
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,312
Beep.

766
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,807
I'm going to go find Peaches.

767
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:17,111
Guys, over here. Come on, it's a shortcut.

768
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:18,611
You're going to love this.

769
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,988
Come on, girls, let's have some fun.

770
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,115
Wow!

771
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:25,160
- This is so cool.
- It's like we're upside down.

772
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,082
That is amazing.

773
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:28,742
Echo!

774
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:37,005
Too bad your molehog friend
isn't here, huh'?

775
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,677
You're not really friends with him, are you?

776
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,595
Yeah, come clean, Peaches.

777
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,924
Are you friends
with that awkward little rodent or not?

778
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,512
I mean...

779
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,265
Louis and I, we've hung out or whatever.

780
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,852
But, no, we're not really friends-friends.

781
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,057
Not friends?

782
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,565
Louis! I...

783
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,149
Busted.

784
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,909
Good to know.

785
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,407
Louis, wait.

786
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,537
He even runs away like a loser.

787
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:12,336
Whoa, Peaches, don't stress.
You're with <i>us</i> now.

788
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:15,005
<i>Yeah, stress is so stressful.</i>

789
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,675
Yeah, girl, if you're going to stress
about something, <i>stress</i> about your hair.

790
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,425
I know, right?
This humidity, I can't stand it.

791
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:28,094
Guys, we should get out of here.

792
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,178
Are you kidding? This is epic!

793
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,932
Go! Go! Go!

794
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:41,277
Yeah!

795
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,900
How sick was that?

796
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,987
<i>Yo, that was insane.</i>

797
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,032
Hey, Peach, loosen up! Have some fun.

798
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,243
Fun, you call that fun? I'm out of here.

799
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,670
Come on, do you really want to go back...

800
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:58,670
to hanging with a weird molehog freak
and give all of this up?

801
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,002
I mean, it's bad enough
that your family is half possum and...

802
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,176
Bad enough?

803
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:05,590
There is nothing bad
about being part of my family.

804
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,015
I like hanging by my tail.

805
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:11,387
And if you geniuses are normal,
this species is going to end up extinct.

806
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:15,107
Yeah, well, your species
is going to be extinct first.

807
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,812
Burn!

808
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,986
We're the same species, genius.

809
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:21,655
What? Double burn.

810
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,586
Hey, I can wiggle my toe again.

811
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:47,048
The important one,
the little piggy who went to market.

812
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,258
Wait! I'm talking again.

813
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:52,891
I had so many things
trapped inside of me that I couldn't say.

814
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,064
Like, "Hey, I'm not dead!"

815
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,517
And, "Why does a hurricane
have an eye but not an ear?"

816
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:02,439
I'll push him overboard.
You guys say it was an accident.

817
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:05,357
I'm in. How about you, Diego? Diego?

818
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,610
Hey, relax, buddy!

819
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,863
Captain Crazy
and his floating petting zoo are history.

820
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,825
Come on! We're finally heading home!

821
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:14,999
I don't know what's wrong with me.

822
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:17,919
I can't eat, can't sleep.
Maybe I'm coming down with something.

823
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,748
I know what you've got.

824
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,254
The L word.

825
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,085
Yeah, leprosy.

826
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,047
No, Sid, it's four letters.

827
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,599
It starts with "L," ends with "E."

828
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,513
Lice!

829
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:36,017
No, Diego, my friend, is in love.

830
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,645
Oh, yeah! Love.

831
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,147
You mean with the pirate? No.

832
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:44,529
Shira's gotten under your skin.
Come on, admit it.

833
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,777
A rugged saber like you.

834
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,526
A more rugged saber like her.

835
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,453
No, no, no. You guys are dead wrong.

836
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,164
Denial is the clincher.
You're in love, pussy cat!

837
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,792
<i>Diego and Shira
Sitting in a tree</i>

838
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,215
K-I-S-S-I-N-G

839
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,384
Real mature, guys. Real mature.

840
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,421
<i>Then comes marriage
Then comes a baby in the baby carriage</i>

841
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:09,964
<i>Sucking his thumb...</i>

842
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,472
Diego.

843
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:22,101
Diego.

844
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,769
Shira?

845
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:26,567
I wanted to come with you.

846
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,155
She's beautiful.

847
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,827
Sid...

848
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:37,079
I adore a sloth who cares
nothing about personal hygiene.

849
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,830
That's me, baby.

850
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,328
Granny.

851
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,755
Come to me, Granny.

852
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,001
Well, hello.

853
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:52,722
The wrinklier the raisin,
the sweeter the fruit.

854
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,391
Granny likey.

855
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,594
Granny likey very much.

856
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:02,729
- Guys, aren't you paying attention?
- Manny...

857
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:05,061
- Manny, are you there?
- Ellie?

858
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,020
We're over here, Manny.

859
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,651
This way, Daddy.

860
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,983
I really need you.

861
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,281
I know, honey. Stay there.

862
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,617
I'm coming.

863
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,791
You were right, Manny.
You're always right.

864
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,580
No, look, I was...

865
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,417
Wait a minute. Ellie would never say that.

866
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:26,624
Manny? Manny.

867
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,881
No, they're not real. They're monsters!

868
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,008
They're sirens. Don't listen to them!

869
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:36,638
<i>Who can take the sunrise
Sprinkle it with dew</i>

870
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:41,472
No! They may look real, but they're not.

871
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,398
They're going to destroy the ship.

872
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,061
Come on, tiger. Swim with me.

873
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,272
Sid...

874
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,861
I have a snack for you.

875
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,238
And she cooks, too.

876
01:00:58,405 --> 01:00:59,406
Sid, no!

877
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:17,174
Why are we kissing?

878
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,430
Because cruises are romantic?

879
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,273
Five more seconds
and we'd have been goners.

880
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,270
Call me.

881
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,550
Here, girl.

882
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,265
Here, Precious.

883
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,806
She thinks she finally found her pet.

884
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:46,934
Good girl. Here you go.

885
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:51,018
Granny, can't you throw imaginary food
to your imaginary pet?

886
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,071
Enough already.

887
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,656
We need to keep a lookout for home.

888
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,071
Ignore them, Precious.

889
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,493
I do.

890
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,331
You can't take your eyes off her
for one minute.

891
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:14,041
Nope, it's like having a child.

892
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,506
Only without any of the joy.

893
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,928
Hey, brain trust...

894
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,346
brace for impact.

895
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:26,849
Guys, look.

896
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,388
We're almost home!

897
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,849
- Buddy, I never doubted you.
- Me either.

898
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:35,692
Except for the six or seven times
I thought we were going to die.

899
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,087
What's wrong, sweetheart?

900
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,585
You ever say something
you knew you couldn't take back?

901
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,041
Is this about Louis?

902
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:57,842
I messed up so bad, Mom.

903
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,715
It's okay. It happens.

904
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:03,803
Cute boys can whiplash your brain.
No doubt about that.

905
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,725
But Ethan was the wrong guy.

906
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,926
And you figured it out.

907
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:09,100
You'll know what to say to Louis.

908
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:16,770
What's going on?

909
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:23,944
The land bridge.

910
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,321
It's gone.

911
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,034
We're trapped!

912
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:37,458
But we were supposed to meet Dad here.
What are we going to do?

913
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,058
Ellie!

914
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,306
Peaches!

915
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,271
Oh, no. The land bridge.

916
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:00,822
But if it's gone...

917
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:01,944
-how are we going to...
- Sid!

918
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:04,071
No, they have to be on the other side.

919
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,278
Manny, there is no other side.

920
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:07,408
They have to be here.

921
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:08,534
Ellie!

922
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,040
Peaches!

923
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,042
I'm here!

924
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,121
Please...

925
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,002
she's got to be here.

926
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:28,599
Dad!

927
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:30,177
- Wait, did you hear that?
- Manny...

928
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,388
No, I heard something. I heard it!

929
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,851
- Is that. . . ?
- Peaches? There she is!

930
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,440
Dad!

931
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,863
We're coming, sweetie. Don't move!

932
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:42,981
Daddy!

933
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,190
Peaches!

934
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,110
Welcome home, Daddy.

935
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,285
Let go of me.

936
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:50,284
What are the odds?

937
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,124
We were just talking about you.

938
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:58,251
You like the new ship?
I call her Sweet Revenge.

939
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:03,594
And look here. We've got the catch du jour.

940
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,174
Ellie.

941
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,054
I'm all right.

942
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,598
Let my daughter go.

943
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,383
It's okay.

944
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,349
He wants me. And he's going to get me.

945
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:22,362
Sacrificing yourself for your daughter.
How touching.

946
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:24,155
How predictable.

947
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,982
Now come and get her.

948
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:33,907
Good day, mate.

949
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,287
You remember us?

950
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:36,743
We're the bad guys.

951
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,379
All right, let them go.

952
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,006
I don't think so.

953
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,709
You destroyed everything I had.

954
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,215
I'm just returning the favor.

955
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,755
No!

956
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,850
I warned you.

957
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:54,052
Stop!

958
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:59,437
Let the mammoth go!

959
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,184
Weiner?

960
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,316
Who brought the muscle to the party?

961
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,442
Louis, don't!

962
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,150
What's he doing?
He's going to get himself killed.

963
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,156
It's okay, I can handle him.

964
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:13,239
How cute, a hero.

965
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:15,540
Let's see what bravery gets you.

966
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,126
Gupta, give the lad your weapon.

967
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,457
Nice knowing you, kid.

968
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,051
Let's dance, hero.

969
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:56,327
Don't stand there like barnacles. Get him!

970
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,334
Oi, going somewhere, mate?

971
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,675
Let me at him.

972
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,140
Any last words?

973
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,555
Precious!

974
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,762
Will you stop with the "Precious"?

975
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,433
Mummy.

976
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,438
Well, I guess we showed them, huh?

977
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,819
- Precious!
- That's your pet?

978
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,992
Maybe that crazy old bat
isn't that crazy after all.

979
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:41,204
Nope, she's nuts.

980
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:44,788
You waiting for a formal invitation,
fancy pants?

981
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:45,918
Get in.

982
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,749
I'm going to regret this.

983
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,552
Bombs away!

984
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,178
Don't be a scaredy cat.

985
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,400
This smells worse than me.

986
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,779
Precious, set your flippers
45 degrees north.

987
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,655
Granny's done running.

988
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:15,735
Back off.

989
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,661
It's okay, I'm on your side.

990
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:20,490
I knew you were a traitor.

991
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:24,787
Your little bunny nose wiggles
in the cutest way when you're mad.

992
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,212
What?

993
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,331
Your nine lives are over, kitty.

994
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:29,506
Silly rabbit...

995
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,175
piracy doesn't pay.

996
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,252
Hey, that's not cool. Come on, now.

997
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:41,685
Anyone have a body wipe?

998
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:44,605
Suck it up, buttercup. How's it looking?

999
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,769
Not good, Granny sir.

1000
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:50,903
Full speed ahead!

1001
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,939
Dive, dive, dive!

1002
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:01,748
Fire!

1003
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,910
Booyah, baby!

1004
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:11,716
This feels so good!

1005
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,293
Thank you, Mister Whale.

1006
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,963
- Hi, Manny.
- Sid!

1007
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,217
Help!

1008
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:21,475
Mom!

1009
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,979
No, Peaches, I'll get your mother.
You stay there.

1010
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,431
Hurry, Manny.

1011
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,565
Payback time.

1012
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:33,729
Manny!

1013
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,066
- Ellie!
- I got this, Dad.

1014
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,652
Peaches, no! It's too dangerous!

1015
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,658
Not if you're half-possum!

1016
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,088
She did it.

1017
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,844
My daughter's all grown up.

1018
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,388
That's my girl.

1019
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,193
We need to get out of here.

1020
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,770
Go, go, I'm right behind you.

1021
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:14,945
No!

1022
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,864
I'm right behind you.

1023
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:18,654
Dad!

1024
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:28,664
No!

1025
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,464
There's nowhere to run, Manny.

1026
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:48,764
You know, this ocean
isn't big enough for the both of us.

1027
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:50,606
Don't worry...

1028
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:53,935
you won't take up much space
once I flatten you.

1029
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,790
I told you, tubby...

1030
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:12,082
you shouldn't have messed
with the Master of the Seas.

1031
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,833
You know, sometimes,
it pays to weigh eleven tons!

1032
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:18,171
No!

1033
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,803
Bon voyage, monkey boy!

1034
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,015
Did somebody hail a whale?

1035
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:39,189
So, you must be Precious.

1036
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,032
Mission accomplished, Granny.

1037
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,449
Who <i>says</i> old ladies can't drive?

1038
01:12:55,997 --> 01:13:00,047
Oh, Captain Gutt!

1039
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,545
That's me!

1040
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:05,465
Let's rule the seas together.

1041
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,224
Ave, aye.

1042
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,361
Dad!

1043
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,985
How's that for an entrance?

1044
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,958
Dad!

1045
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,336
Manny.

1046
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,758
I told you
your father would never give up on us.

1047
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,676
Never.

1048
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,673
Hey, I actually...

1049
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,307
You know, Sid...

1050
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:53,979
you're not such a screw-up.

1051
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,140
- Really?
- Really.

1052
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:57,896
You're a hero.

1053
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,690
You too, Granny.

1054
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,400
Thanks, lady.

1055
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,154
So, still want me
on your scurvy crew?

1056
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,701
You bet.
Welcome to our herd.

1057
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:11,368
Hey, you.

1058
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:14,872
I can't believe you did that for me.

1059
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,123
Thank you.

1060
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,750
Someone once told me,
no matter what...

1061
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:20,581
you never leave a friend behind.

1062
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:24,965
All this sweetness
is going to rot my teeth.

1063
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,091
If I had any.

1064
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:33,557
Our home is gone.

1065
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,309
Where do we go now?

1066
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,493
Momma loves you, too!

1067
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,360
- I can't wait to check this place out.
- Yeah.

1068
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:31,865
- Excuse me?
- Dad!

1069
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:35,661
When you two get off this ship,
I expect you both to...

1070
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,787
have fun.

1071
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,167
You're a brave kid, Weiner.

1072
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,495
Wait, what?

1073
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,998
You heard me.
You two should go out and explore.

1074
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,966
Go where the day takes you.

1075
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,461
But be back before sunset.

1076
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,597
An hour after sunset?

1077
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:52,889
Yeah, not a minute later.

1078
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,558
Deal.

1079
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,681
I love you, Dad.

1080
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:03,730
Okay if we hang with you guys?

1081
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:04,901
Sure.

1082
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,570
I always liked him.

1083
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:09,990
Louis the hero.
Brave-a-licious.

1084
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,410
She's not my little girl anymore.

1085
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,488
And you're both going to be just fine.

1086
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:17,824
I know.

1087
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:22,663
You know, Sidney?
You've got yourself a nice family, here.

1088
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:24,960
A real family.

1089
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:27,667
Yeah, I'm pretty lucky.

1090
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,627
Here, chew this kiwi for me.

1091
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,754
Never again.

1092
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,552
Ta-da!

1093
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:44,017
- Hey, sailor.
- Whoa!

1094
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,394
Welcome, brother.

1095
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:31,197
Behold, Scratlantis.

1096
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:30,581
No!

1097
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,291
Stop!

1098
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:36,971
Brother, rise above this base desire.

1099
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,344
Be more than a rodent.
