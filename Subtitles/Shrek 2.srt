Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

349
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:46,661
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.

When did you decide this?

355
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:01,762
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I'm sorry...

356
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:05,190
No, that's all right.
I need to go, anyway.

357
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:08,619
But remember, dear.
If you should ever need me...

358
00:22:08,883 --> 00:22:09,918
happiness...

359
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:11,689
is just a teardrop away.

360
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:14,278
Thanks, but we've got all
the happiness we need.

- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?

365
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:27,495
I told you coming here was a bad idea.

366
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:30,253
You could've at least tried
to get along with my father.

367

I don't think I was going to get
Daddy's blessing,

Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what I wanted?

370
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,354
Sure. Do you want me
to pack for you?

371
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:46,215
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...

- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!

Here's a news flash for you!

374

Whether your parents like it or not...
I am an ogre!

That's not about to change.

377
00:23:10,485 --> 00:23:14,398
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

That's real smooth, Shrek.
"I'm an ogre!"

I knew this would happen.

[Lillian] You should.
You started it.

383
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:53,731
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.

384
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:57,258
I think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.

385
00:23:57,489 --> 00:23:59,764
This is Fiona's choice.

386
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:02,907
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.

387
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:07,161
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... thing?

388
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:11,168
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.

389
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:15,852
I don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

390
00:24:16,132 --> 00:24:18,646
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

Don't you remember
when we were young?

We used to walk
down by the lily pond and...

- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.

394

It's not the same!

395
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:33,395
I don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

how it could get any worse!

400
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:44,435
- Hello, Harold.
- [Gasps]

401
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:46,532
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!

402
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:49,536
Just the old hunting wound
playing up a bit!

[Chuckles]

I'll just stretch it
out here for a while.

You better get in.
We need to talk.

off to bed.

a quick visit. What?

409
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:10,401
Oh, hello.
Ha-ha-ha!

410

So, what's new?

411

You remember my son,
Prince Charming?

Is that you? My gosh!
It's been years.

413

When did you get back?

414
00:25:23,447 --> 00:25:26,280
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

415
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:29,882
After I endured blistering winds,
scorching desert...

416
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,998
I climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower...

He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower...

420
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:44,960
And what does he find?

421
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:48,688
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess

422
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,727
is already married.

423
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,245
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

424
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:55,026

- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.

- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, I'm fine.

you don't want me to go back on my part.

[Sighs deeply] Indeed not.

So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.
