2
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:28,041
I always get the shake before drop.

3
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:31,948
I had the objection,

4
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:35,284
hypnotic prep,

5
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,893
and federation shrink
scan my brain wave.

6
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:47,338
Everything checked out.

7
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,479
Doc said it wasn't fear.

8
00:00:53,663 --> 00:00:55,499
I could've told him that.

9
00:00:57,982 --> 00:01:00,796
A horse locked in the starting
gate isn't afraid.

10
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,494
He just ready to run.

11
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:47,144
A team, our mission is to seize
and control the B dock carrier,

12
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:50,456
and clear away the bugs
and evac the survivor.

13
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:54,828
And once we land, we join forces
with K-12 team at the fort.

14
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:56,276
It's a standard grab and go.

15
00:01:56,277 --> 00:01:58,708
After the rescue, we
return to the ship,

16
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:01,614
take off and then we blow
the fort and the bugs.

17
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:03,021
Are we clear?

18
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,896
Loud and clear sir.

19
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:17,542
Go..

20
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:19,722
Go, go, go..

21
00:02:58,747 --> 00:02:59,395
Report!

22
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:01,990
Pretty bad sir. Someone of our man
are still in the bar corridor.

23
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:03,932
Then let's get them out of there.

24
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:06,909
Mech, we're done here.
We have to blow.

25
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:07,290
Sir!

26
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:12,307
Holy Man and Chow, on the cover.
Biggest and Grimeshock hold position.

27
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:14,153
The rest of you, follow me.

28
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,569
We're on the rescue mission people.

29
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:29,033
Lt Jordan, what's your status?

30
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:31,685
Too many bugs, no way
to take back Fort Casey.

31
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,346
We'll hold until the
John A. Warden evacuates.

32
00:03:34,987 --> 00:03:37,718
Alesia will stand-by
for immediate evac.

33
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,473
- Keep me posted.
- Roger that.

34
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:40,419
Mech, what's your ETR?

35
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:41,941
Almost there sir.

36
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,530
Done. Let's go.

37
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:03,331
Charleston down. Medic!

38
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,862
I'm on it.

39
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:14,638
Have you completed loading the crates?

40
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,850
Note that is your priority.

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,103
What the hell is this about Carl?

42
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:31,795
Wonderful to see you again Carmen.

43
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:33,577
You commandeer my damn ship.

44
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,599
Borrowing it. I'll give it back.

45
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:37,919
You're never going to take
the John A. Warden from me.

46
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,279
Guards I believe Capt. Ibanez
need an escort to the East Wing.

47
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:45,094
What do you want with my ship Carl?

48
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:50,108
Carmen, that's classified.
But I can tell you this,

49
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:53,280
this mission, oh this mission
will turn the tide.

50
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:55,679
You always were such an asshole.

51
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:59,178
And I'm always so fond of
you as well, Carmen.

52
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,857
See you on Terra.

53
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:04,043
Friend always, right?

54
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:21,026
A team reload!

55
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:24,917
This is A team leader
to Fort Casey.

56
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,407
Evac, come in

57
00:05:26,462 --> 00:05:27,979
About god damn time.

58
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:30,174
It's a little crowded out here,
exit now. Dock B.

59
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:31,221
On our way.

60
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:32,393
Show some hassle.

61
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,208
It's quiet now but that
ain't going to last.

62
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,301
Evac coming out.

63
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,713
Keep your eyes open
and your heads down.

64
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:40,938
I don't to lose anyone
to friendly fire.

65
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,770
Who's in charge?

66
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:49,176
Acting commander sir!

67
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:51,683
Major Henry Varro was been
relieved of duty.

68
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:54,057
Relieved? What the hell happen?

69
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,259
This was a suicide mission from
the gecko. Fucking-headcase!

70
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,144
Shut your mouth Ratazz.
You want to be busted like Hero?

71
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,971
We're outta here.
Let's get back to the ship.

72
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:50,949
Mech, how is it coming
with that charge?

73
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:53,067
Armed and dangerous.

74
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:03,793
You have to be kidding me!

75
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,357
Thanks for waiting Jack-ass

76
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:19,263
Command, if there's a new order
let me know god damn it.

77
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:22,326
Are we going to escort the
John A. Warden or not?

78
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,819
Behind us!

79
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,664
Sir! This is Biggest, can't
hold on anymore. We're...

80
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:41,431
Fuck son-of-bitches....

81
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:46,497
Captain Jonah, this is A team.
Landing ship destroyed.

82
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:47,434
Boarding directly now.

83
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:51,622
Roger that, as soon as you're
aboard, Alesia will depart.

84
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:55,778
Left formation! Fall back
to the Alesia.

85
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,103
Hold formation!  Hold formation!

86
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:32,257
My arm! My god damn arm!

87
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,719
Medic!

88
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:43,586
424!

89
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,896
425!

90
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,850
426!

91
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,233
Return to the ship!

92
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:53,864
428!

93
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:55,918
429!

94
00:08:56,692 --> 00:08:57,411
30!

95
00:08:58,067 --> 00:08:58,702
431!

96
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:02,535
Trig, move your god damn ass!
We're taking off!

97
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:16,731
Come on.

98
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:18,114
Come on.

99
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:22,926
Jump!

100
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:36,015
Thanks.

101
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:37,960
Anytime.

102
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,476
- Score?
- 430.

103
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:43,391
Give or take.

104
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:14,224
You going to do it or what?

105
00:10:14,318 --> 00:10:16,751
Hit it Maestro

106
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:21,212
3, 2, 1.

107
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,985
Boom!

108
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,646
Come on guy, this shit ain't over yet.

109
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,976
Haha yeah, alright.

110
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:52,854
So what the hell happen
to you guys down there?

111
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:55,409
We were right on top of a
mother-fucking ant hill.

112
00:10:55,565 --> 00:11:01,097
Varro save our ass, then that ESP
prick, Jenkins sent us on a death run.

113
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:04,238
Straight into a god damn hive.

114
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:06,610
But you didn't hear that shit from me.

115
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:08,450
Ah I'm sorry, did you say something?

116
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:09,577
Attention!

117
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:16,747
You can all be proud of yourselves.

118
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:20,598
We save some lives

119
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:22,809
and we kill some bugs

120
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:26,021
But we lost some good troopers today.

121
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:27,670
Here's to the dead.

122
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:30,171
And to the next man to die.

123
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:31,684
Now let's get back to Terra

124
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:34,155
and we can put some real
glasses in these hands.

125
00:11:44,016 --> 00:11:45,699
Hey, check that out.

126
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:49,922
What's the matter, you never saw
a flanking without an arm before?

127
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:52,329
Yeah, but they usually
looks like Ratazz.

128
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,458
Ratazz?

129
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:55,857
That's what they call me

130
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:58,423
because you didn't give a
rat-ass about anything.

131
00:11:58,423 --> 00:11:59,294
What a surprise.

132
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:03,086
Hey, you wanna me to
show you to the shower?

133
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:05,094
I could wash you back.

134
00:12:07,174 --> 00:12:09,156
You don't want to wash my front?

135
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:21,701
Shut up!

136
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,947
Captain on the bridge.

137
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:43,542
Stand down, this is your
ship not mine Captain.

138
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:47,428
Simple respect Captain Ibanez
for what happen on Planet B.

139
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:50,900
If only more stripes were executed that way.

140
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,686
I had a good team.

141
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:54,849
What can you tell me?

142
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:57,914
- About?
- Where's my ship?

143
00:12:57,953 --> 00:12:59,691
And why does Jenkins want it so badly?

144
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:02,982
Captain, believe me if I could
provide with any information

145
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:05,770
This ship is in pursuit of
the John A. Warden isn't it?

146
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:07,798
I understand your concern
of John A. Warden

147
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,047
Captain Ibanez but this is the
Alesia and we command it.

148
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:13,609
Our orders are to return to Terra

149
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,945
Then show me that data on
the John A. Warden's path.

150
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:17,589
Where is she headed?

151
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:18,667
We don't know Captain.

152
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:22,872
We lost her signal shortly
after we began pursuit.

153
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:28,871
Please contact me if you found
the John A. Warden.

154
00:13:29,837 --> 00:13:31,265
Aye, aye, Captain

155
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:38,025
Don't have of a joint or some kind?

156
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,675
This is a serious wound.

157
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:44,541
Could have been a lot worse.

158
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:47,517
I can't keep something like
this off the record.

159
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:50,564
I'm going have to
take your arm off.

160
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:52,135
Fine. But look..

161
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:55,378
At least do what you can to make sure so
it doesn't get back to my folks.

162
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:57,474
You can at least do that, right doc?

163
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:04,230
Let's do this.

164
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:06,901
Why don't we wait until
the shaking stop?

165
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:07,966
The ship will be fine.

166
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:09,563
I'm not talking about the ship.

167
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:50,604
Hey noob, dance class
is down the hall.

168
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:53,689
No, it's right here. Care to dance?

169
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:57,001
This ring, is for fighting.

170
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:58,153
Humor me.

171
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:01,863
- What's your name?
- Chow.

172
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:03,021
Well Chow,

173
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:05,340
I don't usually dance with guys,

174
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:08,029
but in your case, I'll
make an exception.

175
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,770
Who's your money on?

176
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:11,246
Ratazz is bigger.

177
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:13,996
- Not much upstairs though.
- Whatever dude.

178
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:17,724
Ratazz get him one good solid hit,
Chow is going down.

179
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:19,240
Shit, if he could ever land a punch.

180
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,099
Chow is fast man.

181
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:26,442
Alright fighters to your corners.

182
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:33,405
You back up down,
I won't think even less of you.

183
00:15:35,156 --> 00:15:38,132
When I ring the bell,
come out fighting.

184
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:41,820
We're going to miss you
when you're gone.

185
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:11,445
Good thing there's
not much upstairs,

186
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:12,831
don't have to worry
about brain damage.

187
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:15,198
Hey, damage this...

188
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:30,496
Hey..

189
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:44,036
You see that?

190
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,804
Didn't know you had it in you.

191
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,711
Flash of inspiration.

192
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:00,768
E-057..

193
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:02,947
E-057..

194
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:07,212
E...0..5...7

195
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:26,693
Thanks. I really appreciate..

196
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:28,640
it.

197
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:37,988
They can't get me a
bed until tomorrow.

198
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:41,030
Thanks for letting me use the comm...

199
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:42,219
Tia

200
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:44,053
Tia Durer

201
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:46,751
- Trig is fine.
- Ottis hags.

202
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:48,696
Bugspray.

203
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,053
Hey...

204
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,413
Thanks for the catch..

205
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:56,628
at Fort Casey.

206
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,974
You're sleeping with a gun?

207
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,932
You must know something I don't.

208
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:05,342
Barreta XXX4.

209
00:18:05,643 --> 00:18:07,487
A classic.

210
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:14,611
You've got a nice smile for a soldier.

211
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:15,942
Thanks.

212
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:18,204
I think.

213
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:20,295
So..

214
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:21,510
Up for a little training?

215
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,148
I think I have about all the target
practice I could stand today.

216
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:28,809
Yeah, I was thinking about something
a little more...

217
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:30,480
Extreme-less.

218
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,775
You didn't really use the
intercom, did you?

219
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:41,407
Would you like to know more?

220
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:52,242
Everyone is doing their part.

221
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:08,406
Major Henry Varro..

222
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:14,093
One of the most decorated
officers in the federation.

223
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:20,500
You earn long range ops
in places even god won't.

224
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:27,425
What did you do?

225
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:28,995
Why won't you talk?

226
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:33,228
And why won't your men talk?

227
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:47,771
HE-RO

228
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:58,698
They're a couple of
modifications you can

229
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,326
score on the black market
when you get to Terra.

230
00:20:01,341 --> 00:20:03,906
But as far as the federation
would pay for it,

231
00:20:03,907 --> 00:20:05,427
it's still pretty
good prosthetic.

232
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:06,076
Got it.

233
00:20:06,514 --> 00:20:07,771
Nice job.

234
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,615
Don't know what you're nervous about..

235
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:12,020
I bet this looks good
as all the others.

236
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:15,634
What others? You're my first.

237
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:18,984
As the matter of fact,
you're the first guy

238
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,892
that I've work on that actually live.

239
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:28,378
Every Commander
I've ever served under,

240
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:30,941
tries to get me to use
regular machine gun.

241
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:34,690
That is until they see how
many I kill without one.

242
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,208
And they don't ask me anymore.

243
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:42,924
My parents leave me that rifle.

244
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:49,192
There was an armory in my hometown.

245
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:52,467
Everyone worked there.

246
00:20:56,439 --> 00:21:00,253
That is until the bugs melted
the place with a plasma bomb.

247
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:05,427
Soldiers, civilian, families.

248
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,891
Everyone died.

249
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:14,939
I swore then that I'd kill
just as many bugs.

250
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,312
And I would do it with that gun.

251
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:23,516
That's why you count?

252
00:21:24,636 --> 00:21:27,948
No, that's why it counts.

253
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:09,110
God damn you Carl.

254
00:22:18,227 --> 00:22:20,312
Where did you learn
that hay maker?

255
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,358
Dance class.

256
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:23,945
Shit! I knew it!

257
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,650
I just felt it.

258
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,791
We aren't going to see Terra
anytime soon.

259
00:22:28,831 --> 00:22:29,643
Well private...

260
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:30,674
Specialist actually.

261
00:22:31,214 --> 00:22:33,339
Well...Almost

262
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,123
5 points short on the ESP test,

263
00:22:35,124 --> 00:22:37,623
if one more jacket had
have been a diamond,

264
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,791
I wouldn't be here
with your dumb asses.

265
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:43,490
You son-of-a-bitch!

266
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,762
That's how you always know
when I'm in the shower.

267
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:51,100
So, can you tell what
I'm thinking now?

268
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:53,190
Hell, even I know what
you're thinking now.

269
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,253
You make me sick.

270
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,016
What's up Lt Daugherty?

271
00:23:02,118 --> 00:23:03,492
I thought you were in medical?

272
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,164
Ah...

273
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:05,736
Wasn't as bad as it looks.

274
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:12,316
Ah..glad you two could make it.

275
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,987
At ease.

276
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:28,623
I wanted you brief you all personally.

277
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:29,360
First and foremost,

278
00:23:29,445 --> 00:23:33,306
because I know of the great sacrifices
of both the crew of the Alesia

279
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,509
as well as the defender
of Fort Casey of Maine

280
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,716
and the great losses
that you suffered

281
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:40,966
and second, I know you could
all use some RNR about now

282
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:43,108
Believe me, I've been there myself.

283
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,262
But unfortunately,
we have a situation.

284
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,793
What?!

285
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:48,497
Stowen!

286
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:50,480
The John A. Warden has gone silent.

287
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:55,029
The Alesia is the only starship in
the areas of last contact.

288
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,594
I've ordered your Captain
to divert course,

289
00:23:57,595 --> 00:23:59,844
find the Warden and investigate.

290
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:02,980
Any question?

291
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:04,977
Yeah.

292
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:08,156
I think I speak for everyone from
Fort Casey when I say this..

293
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:09,671
Shut the fuck up!

294
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:11,244
It's okay, go on.

295
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,181
We're only going in if
Hero takes point.

296
00:24:17,341 --> 00:24:17,943
Hero?

297
00:24:18,404 --> 00:24:19,057
Major Henry Varro.

298
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:21,433
Commander of Fort Casey, General Rico.

299
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,122
Right...

300
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:26,417
Arrested by Dr. Carl
Jenkins for insubordination

301
00:24:26,456 --> 00:24:28,131
at the battle at Fort Casey.

302
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,110
Fine!

303
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,042
If Major Varro chooses to
participate in this mission,

304
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:35,380
the mobile infantry will
accept his service.

305
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:38,549
However, this will not in any way
be prejudicial to his trial.

306
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,587
Is that understood?

307
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:40,854
Understood sir.

308
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,284
We probably lose communication
as you cross the Nebula...

309
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:47,534
Godspeed Alesia!

310
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:48,749
Dismissed!

311
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:53,145
Assemble in the staging area.

312
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:55,168
A word Captain Ibanez.

313
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,671
Why did you let him take my ship?

314
00:25:00,645 --> 00:25:04,700
Carmen, it's not your ship, it
belongs to the Terran Federation.

315
00:25:05,044 --> 00:25:08,698
General Rico, perhaps you recall
there were a certain young trooper

316
00:25:08,699 --> 00:25:11,224
who was with me when the
Rodger Young when down

317
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:15,433
I vowed that would never happen
to a ship under my command.

318
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:18,856
This is not my choice

319
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:19,606
Honey, look.

320
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:22,480
I don't care what you thought
about Carl back when you knew him

321
00:25:22,543 --> 00:25:23,895
and I don't care what you
think about him now.

322
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,813
He's minister of
paranormal warfare

323
00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:29,340
and high command has authorized
to use the John A. Warden.

324
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:32,087
Look, Carmen...

325
00:25:32,552 --> 00:25:36,001
This is a mission that's so classified
I don't even know what the hell..

326
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:37,466
And look how well It's going.

327
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,669
You know that the John A. Warden
like the back of your hand

328
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:43,753
I need you to go aboard
with the insertion team.

329
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:44,999
I looked at the manifest.

330
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:48,547
That ship didn't just go dark,

331
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:51,313
her signal was turned off.

332
00:25:51,657 --> 00:25:53,577
And you know as well as I do,

333
00:25:53,578 --> 00:25:55,820
the only one who has
the gull to run a

334
00:25:55,852 --> 00:25:58,939
Federation Starship's
dark is Carl Jenkins.

335
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:01,859
And how do you know we're
even close to my ship?

336
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:06,234
Before we lost contact, we analyze
some of the scattered signals.

337
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:07,762
Calculating course and speed,

338
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:10,504
we were able to get a good
estimate of it's location.

339
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:11,571
Now it's not spot on,

340
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,551
but we can get you
pretty damn close.

341
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:17,662
Fine!

342
00:26:18,615 --> 00:26:20,162
I'll do it.

343
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,772
But not to save Carl sorry ass,

344
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:26,163
I'll do it to take back my ship.

345
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:27,846
You just be careful.

346
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:31,990
We need you back, intact,
when this thing is over.

347
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:35,492
Thank you Johnny.

348
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:37,367
Hey Carmen...

349
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:41,978
When this thing is over, maybe you
and I could meet at Zim and a..

350
00:26:42,923 --> 00:26:43,813
Yeah..

351
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,087
Yeah...

352
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:54,202
I gotta tell ya, this will no way to
be prejudicial to your trial.

353
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:57,359
Ah..come on,

354
00:26:57,624 --> 00:26:59,585
I didn't have anything
to do with any of this.

355
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,431
I'm just a damn janitor
trying to clean it up.

356
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,112
Look, Major...

357
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:11,217
I'm no war enthusiastic about
saving Carl Jenkins than you are..

358
00:27:12,602 --> 00:27:14,251
But your men want you.

359
00:27:16,165 --> 00:27:18,963
And something tells me,
we're gonna need you.

360
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:22,924
Lt Daugherty..

361
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,096
We found the John A. Warden

362
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:29,769
Tell Captain Jonah to move to
stand off range. I'll be right up.

363
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:36,585
So, which is it?

364
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,164
Get this chains off me.

365
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:11,740
It'll be too bad if a stray
shot hit Jenkins.

366
00:28:11,944 --> 00:28:14,429
Look, I know you're pissed,
but don't even think about shit like that.

367
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,970
They threw Hero into the brig, you
or me, Holy Man or Kharon,

368
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:20,451
what do you think they
do to grunts like us?

369
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,490
They shoved us out of
the god damn air lock.

370
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:25,076
So I gotta watch my ass?

371
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:28,265
Yeah, but if you're not gonna
do that, at least watch mine.

372
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:39,279
Aw man, fuck you!

373
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:43,162
Can't believe I'm the only who's
didn't get laid around here.

374
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,798
Looks like you've got all
your bases covered.

375
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:53,364
Tell me Holy Man, which one
gonna save you today?

376
00:29:02,002 --> 00:29:04,612
I can take care of myself.

377
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,622
Women, they make the highs higher
and the lows more frequent.

378
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:17,215
Are atheist the only
philosopher you can quote?

379
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:23,243
I find a believer such as you seek
so few things worth rating down.

380
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:24,869
And I found..

381
00:29:25,326 --> 00:29:31,138
That he who look so forward to the
abyss is simply afraid of the light.

382
00:29:32,276 --> 00:29:34,433
I'm gonna get you a pen.

383
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:36,433
Wait, did you just make that up?

384
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:39,285
No, I'm not writing that down.

385
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:47,887
John A. Warden, this is the
Alesia, please respond.

386
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:54,288
I try everything, voice, radio flash,
even light code. Nothing.

387
00:29:54,351 --> 00:29:56,178
Keep trying Lieutenant.

388
00:29:56,202 --> 00:29:58,022
Zoom in on the bridge.

389
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:01,237
Maybe they can't hear us.

390
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:04,940
They have to know what
our objective is.

391
00:30:06,048 --> 00:30:09,360
Bridge, this is your
Captain, respond now!

392
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:12,357
If you do not
respond we will board.

393
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:23,478
Board it, that's not my ship anymore.

394
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:56,643
Kids?

395
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,135
Husband?

396
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:04,917
Died on planet 4976.

397
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:07,558
Hey, the way I figured it,

398
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:10,459
the bugs got more reason
to be sacred than I do.

399
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:14,912
I killed hundreds of them.
They kill zero of me.

400
00:31:19,158 --> 00:31:20,729
Ahh man..

401
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:27,009
Listen, I want you
to do me a favor...

402
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:27,759
Yeah?

403
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:29,727
If I don't make it,

404
00:31:29,728 --> 00:31:32,583
I don't care what
happens to my body

405
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:35,825
but try to get my
rifle's scope will you?

406
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:38,535
And have it bury in my hometown.

407
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,357
Look, I don't like fumes.

408
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:44,581
Do me a favor,

409
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:47,160
don't get killed.

410
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:19,784
Okay, boys and girls..

411
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:23,552
Looks like this is going
to be my last mission,

412
00:32:23,553 --> 00:32:25,135
so let's make it a good one.

413
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,835
Our job is to retake the
John A. Warden,

414
00:32:28,836 --> 00:32:30,739
rescue any and all survivors

415
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,933
and exterminate any
resistance we might find.

416
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,129
You got that?

417
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,496
Sir yes sir!

418
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:41,058
Alright troopers..

419
00:32:41,136 --> 00:32:43,707
Let's get the lady her ship back.

420
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:55,408
Initiate docking procedure.

421
00:32:55,658 --> 00:32:57,938
Initiating docking procedure.

422
00:33:01,965 --> 00:33:05,949
Team 1, Lt Daugherty, Ice,
Trig, Mech, Shock Jock

423
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,020
will lead Capt. Ibanez to the bridge.

424
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:14,793
Team 2, Jace, Kharon, Chow, Bugspray,
Gunfather, Ratazz, Holy Man

425
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,488
and the rest of you,

426
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:17,254
you're coming with me
to the engine room.

427
00:33:17,302 --> 00:33:21,122
Don't know we gonna find in
there so be ready for anything.

428
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:22,662
Let's go..

429
00:33:32,382 --> 00:33:34,960
Gravity zero, oxygen level yellow.

430
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,742
Ready to board the John A. Warden.

431
00:34:03,498 --> 00:34:04,388
We're in.

432
00:34:04,735 --> 00:34:07,446
Team 1 moving towards the bridge.

433
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,244
Team 2 boarding, moving
towards the engine room.

434
00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:46,201
Something up ahead..

435
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:49,053
No..

436
00:34:52,874 --> 00:34:54,890
Oh my god...

437
00:34:57,492 --> 00:35:01,023
Team two, we got bodies
near the bridge.

438
00:35:01,389 --> 00:35:04,076
We got bodies everywhere.

439
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:10,175
Ah man, they've been bug-ripped

440
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:13,590
Infestation confirm,
stay sharp people.

441
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:15,199
Nearing objective.

442
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:20,937
Daugherty to team 2,
we're on the bridge.

443
00:35:23,461 --> 00:35:25,930
And it ain't pretty.

444
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:36,813
Got multiple casualties.

445
00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:40,210
And one dead bug.

446
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:45,632
All clear!

447
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,055
Shock Jock...

448
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,343
Massive tearing wound...

449
00:36:03,757 --> 00:36:05,467
My crew.

450
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:14,803
Bridge is secured, team 2
what's your status, over.

451
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:17,421
Entering engine room now, over.

452
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,081
Fucking blood bath..

453
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:36,276
Team two scout, I got dead
troopers and bugs.

454
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:39,597
Holy shit!

455
00:36:39,902 --> 00:36:41,419
Amen.

456
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:46,803
Why they all die here?

457
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,092
Focus on the mission troopers.

458
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:51,568
Chow, prep the engines.

459
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,300
Yes sir!

460
00:37:05,487 --> 00:37:07,614
Major, I have a survivor

461
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:09,409
Well, find him.

462
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:11,652
Chow, what's the
status on that engine?

463
00:37:11,714 --> 00:37:13,269
- Give me 10.
- You got 5.

464
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,800
Yes sir

465
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:16,977
Team 1, engine operative in 5.

466
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:19,829
Is that a real 5 minutes
or sorta 5 minutes? Over.

467
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:20,922
Hard 5!

468
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:25,356
And we got a possible survivor,
going to investigate, over.

469
00:37:29,717 --> 00:37:33,740
Gunfather, have team hold position.
Bugspray and Ratazz cover Chow.

470
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:35,405
Like paint Major.

471
00:38:43,264 --> 00:38:45,764
Looks like they were trying
to make this into a lab.

472
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,873
What is that thing?

473
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,468
Holding cell, to keep a bug inside.

474
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:08,876
Now, it looks like they were  trying to
keep them out and somebody else in.

475
00:39:15,412 --> 00:39:18,271
Emergency power supply from
Alesia seems to be working.

476
00:39:18,865 --> 00:39:24,490
Team 1, team 2, gravity
restoration in 5, 4..

477
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:35,644
Fuck!

478
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:40,936
Internal oxygen level is green.

479
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:50,390
I feel a whole lot of better If I knew
what happen to those bugs.

480
00:39:50,452 --> 00:39:52,023
Weren't we all?

481
00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:15,423
Who's there?

482
00:40:17,057 --> 00:40:18,111
Major Varro.

483
00:40:18,908 --> 00:40:21,557
What're doing here? You're
suppose to be on trial.

484
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:24,882
Yeah, well looks like
that plan is about as

485
00:40:24,914 --> 00:40:26,953
successful as your
little experiment here.

486
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:29,040
What happen on this ship Jenkins?

487
00:40:29,056 --> 00:40:31,525
I act her, so she hits me

488
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:32,854
She?

489
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:34,791
What do you mean she?

490
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:39,222
We're the opponent, she act
everything, me, the ship.

491
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:40,322
Everything!

492
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:43,922
Well of course she did, she
knew what I was thinking,

493
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:45,261
thoughts become words,
words become teeth,

494
00:40:45,262 --> 00:40:46,553
thought becomes word,
words become teeths.

495
00:40:46,554 --> 00:40:47,844
thought becomes word,
words become teeths.

496
00:40:47,884 --> 00:40:49,591
thought becomes word,
words become teeths.

497
00:40:49,623 --> 00:40:51,189
We're going to get you out of here.

498
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,755
You and I can settle our score
later, open the door Jenkins.

499
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:54,817
And let you kill me? No!

500
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:58,148
Besides, it's safer in here,
safest place on the ship.

501
00:40:58,203 --> 00:41:00,968
Safe place. Yes, safe place,
my safe house.

502
00:41:01,024 --> 00:41:02,250
Open the door Jenkins.

503
00:41:02,305 --> 00:41:03,899
You think it's funny?

504
00:41:04,002 --> 00:41:05,892
Turning tables, tables turned.

505
00:41:05,893 --> 00:41:08,537
I arrested you, now I'm
the one in the cage.

506
00:41:08,538 --> 00:41:10,100
You think that's funny, do you?

507
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:10,512
Do you?

508
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:13,094
I'll leave you ass here,
don't think I won't.

509
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,598
You figured it out while we
clear the rest of the ship.

510
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:17,403
Have this door open by
the time we get back.

511
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:21,991
There's nothing to clear.
The crew is dead, everyone is dead.

512
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:23,275
Darkness..

513
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:29,244
Darkness is your friend, whatever
you do, don't turn on the lights.

514
00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:36,656
Let there be light!

515
00:41:38,266 --> 00:41:39,367
Yes!

516
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:51,369
Varro to Chow, do not restart
the engine. Do you copy?

517
00:41:54,036 --> 00:41:56,208
Don't be afraid of the dark.

518
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:04,972
Good job Chow.

519
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:06,949
The bridge is free.

520
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,450
Jace!..

521
00:42:25,692 --> 00:42:26,879
Grenade!

522
00:42:29,286 --> 00:42:29,888
Bugs!

523
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:32,286
We got bugs, multiple contacts.

524
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:34,560
Holy shit!

525
00:42:47,237 --> 00:42:49,424
Is that the abyss you
were talking about?

526
00:42:49,674 --> 00:42:51,144
Engine room, we're under attack.

527
00:42:51,175 --> 00:42:53,019
Take position, they're coming.

528
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,337
Get back to the airlock,
move and fire.

529
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:19,115
No..

530
00:43:24,116 --> 00:43:26,147
I'll draw them off, you go!

531
00:43:34,883 --> 00:43:35,625
No!

532
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:37,519
We're not leaving him.

533
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:41,167
Go, I'll see you on the other side.

534
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:53,367
Holy Man, hold position and fire.

535
00:43:58,133 --> 00:43:59,430
Die bugs.

536
00:44:00,586 --> 00:44:03,313
You think I give a rat-ass about god?

537
00:44:05,246 --> 00:44:06,090
This way.

538
00:44:32,053 --> 00:44:34,240
Get to the airlock.

539
00:44:37,903 --> 00:44:42,059
V, we headed to the airlock
and they're right on our ass.

540
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,239
Roget that.

541
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,187
God damn it!

542
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:07,591
Bugs.

543
00:45:36,788 --> 00:45:37,476
Chow!

544
00:45:40,695 --> 00:45:44,910
Alesia, we're under massive bug
attack, request immediate evac.

545
00:45:45,004 --> 00:45:47,785
Repeat, request immediate evac.

546
00:45:48,777 --> 00:45:51,958
Roger that, Alesia is preparing
for your retrieval.

547
00:45:55,112 --> 00:45:56,245
Let's go!

548
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:02,643
This is Alesia, ready for
your arrival, over.

549
00:46:13,612 --> 00:46:14,690
Contact!

550
00:46:20,198 --> 00:46:21,542
It's jammed!

551
00:46:39,978 --> 00:46:43,071
Don't suppose you have good
replacement parts to fix this.

552
00:46:45,752 --> 00:46:47,408
You gonna make it..

553
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:48,963
Oh that's right...

554
00:46:49,744 --> 00:46:54,167
You can't let me die, I the only one
of your patient who said to lived.

555
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,485
Open the airlock.

556
00:47:18,275 --> 00:47:19,361
Shock Jock, you go first.

557
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:20,438
Yes, sir.

558
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,768
What the hell? Evasive action!

559
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,558
Shock Jock!

560
00:47:41,266 --> 00:47:43,434
Close the door.

561
00:47:48,101 --> 00:47:49,890
What the hell just happen?

562
00:47:50,126 --> 00:47:51,508
The Alesia is gone.

563
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:52,984
Did we just fired on them?

564
00:47:53,054 --> 00:47:56,142
Alesia, Captain Jonah, answer me!

565
00:48:02,423 --> 00:48:05,280
Listen up everybody,
we head to the bridge.

566
00:48:05,281 --> 00:48:05,994
Now!

567
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,643
Since when did she gives the orders?

568
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,656
Since we boarded her ship.

569
00:48:12,704 --> 00:48:14,930
Just asking...

570
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:16,133
Bugs!

571
00:48:26,453 --> 00:48:28,437
I act her so she hit me.

572
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:30,860
I act her so she hit me.

573
00:48:30,899 --> 00:48:33,094
I act her so she hit me.

574
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:34,914
I act her so she hit me.

575
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:35,516
I act..

576
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,296
Are you alright Captain?

577
00:48:50,632 --> 00:48:53,656
You know, if I wanted to
run this much..

578
00:48:54,023 --> 00:48:56,702
I'd have joined the mobile infantry.

579
00:49:00,339 --> 00:49:02,777
Captain Ibanez to the L6 Base.

580
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:04,316
High Command?

581
00:49:04,784 --> 00:49:09,986
This is the John A. Warden,
Johnny? Please respond.

582
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:13,011
Communications is always
jagging your world.

583
00:49:13,136 --> 00:49:16,566
Recommend we position ourselves
away from the Nebula.

584
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:20,753
How did the cannon fired?
And why target our own ship?

585
00:49:20,823 --> 00:49:22,854
Jenkins try to warn us.

586
00:49:23,198 --> 00:49:25,215
Carl is alive?

587
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,606
Locked himself in the bug cage.

588
00:49:26,692 --> 00:49:29,043
And you're just now telling me this?

589
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:30,317
Look Captain..

590
00:49:30,497 --> 00:49:33,645
If you're ready for a full
debriefing I'm all for it.

591
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,247
Hero..

592
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:40,666
Jenkins found a queen on Fort Casey,
he ordered us to capture it alive.

593
00:49:41,837 --> 00:49:42,866
What the...

594
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:44,457
Tell her the rest.

595
00:49:44,823 --> 00:49:47,635
Yes Major, tell me the rest of it.

596
00:49:47,768 --> 00:49:51,480
I knew trying to take the queen
will resulting in heavy casualties

597
00:49:51,558 --> 00:49:55,035
I wasn't going to sacrifice
my men for a bug hunt.

598
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,748
So that's why he had you arrested.

599
00:49:58,982 --> 00:50:01,045
But he got the queen after all.

600
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:06,222
Wait a minute, how the hell can
a bug control a Starship?

601
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:08,926
You're going to have to
ask Jenkins that.

602
00:50:10,095 --> 00:50:10,845
What the?

603
00:50:30,295 --> 00:50:31,405
We're moving again.

604
00:50:31,468 --> 00:50:32,827
- Where?
- No idea.

605
00:50:32,953 --> 00:50:34,593
But if the queen is in control...

606
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:36,022
We need to stop her
from getting there.

607
00:50:36,054 --> 00:50:36,719
How?

608
00:50:37,266 --> 00:50:39,305
Back to the engine room,
shut them down.

609
00:50:39,352 --> 00:50:41,453
Negative, not enough soldiers or ammo.

610
00:50:47,324 --> 00:50:49,082
What the hell are you doing?

611
00:50:53,027 --> 00:50:54,729
- Praying.
- Well keep it up.

612
00:50:54,804 --> 00:50:56,850
We're going to need all
the help we can get.

613
00:51:06,428 --> 00:51:08,240
Now, we're back in business.

614
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:12,808
Captain..

615
00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:15,364
You need to take a look at this.

616
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:22,849
She's heading straight
for the Martian Home Wormhole.

617
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:26,076
It will take her straight to earth.

618
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:34,857
This is Captain Ibanez to the L6 Base.

619
00:51:35,381 --> 00:51:38,342
Captain Ibanez calling L6 Base.

620
00:51:39,257 --> 00:51:41,538
This is Captain Ibanez to Johnny Rico.

621
00:51:41,577 --> 00:51:44,522
L6 Base, come in.
This is Captain I....

622
00:51:49,915 --> 00:51:51,994
What the hell are you doing?

623
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:04,429
If she is in the engine room,
then I'm gonna hunt her down.

624
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,460
I'll back you up.

625
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,219
No..

626
00:52:08,484 --> 00:52:09,336
You stay.

627
00:52:10,031 --> 00:52:13,383
Besides, you will never be
able to fit through here.

628
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:16,740
I'll be back.

629
00:52:27,732 --> 00:52:30,138
You're not going to stop her?

630
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:33,518
She's a big girl. She knows
what she's doing.

631
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,386
Do we?

632
00:52:39,487 --> 00:52:41,850
I bypassed the circuit board,

633
00:52:41,852 --> 00:52:45,090
if we can gain control
with out being detected...

634
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:46,943
Strap yourself in.

635
00:52:54,135 --> 00:52:56,049
I'm not gonna seat in that blood seat.

636
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,347
Do it!

637
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,244
She's on to us.

638
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,464
Damn it!

639
00:53:25,253 --> 00:53:26,245
Fire!

640
00:54:32,932 --> 00:54:35,289
General, a Federation Starship is just

641
00:54:35,289 --> 00:54:37,525
emerged from Martian Home Wormhole.

642
00:54:37,568 --> 00:54:39,107
It's...

643
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:42,045
- It's the John A. Warden.
- On screen.

644
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:44,747
- They're receiving our signal sir.
- Any response?

645
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,688
No sir, they're not responding.

646
00:54:48,002 --> 00:54:49,533
Something's wrong.

647
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:52,875
Why would they head
back towards earth?

648
00:54:53,963 --> 00:54:57,498
Sir, if they keep their current
trajectory, the John A. Warden..

649
00:54:57,499 --> 00:54:59,402
Sir, it's heading straight for us.

650
00:55:01,268 --> 00:55:04,362
John A. Warden, this is
General Rico, come in.

651
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:08,096
John A. Warden, this is the L6 Base.

652
00:55:08,476 --> 00:55:11,048
If you do not change
course immediately,

653
00:55:11,049 --> 00:55:12,868
we will be forced to engage.

654
00:55:13,472 --> 00:55:16,576
Repeat, the L6 Base
will take defensive

655
00:55:16,577 --> 00:55:19,369
action if you do not change course.

656
00:55:20,146 --> 00:55:22,427
John A. Warden, respond!

657
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,980
Talk to me Carmen.

658
00:55:47,695 --> 00:55:51,867
The L6 Base, we gotta warn Johnny.

659
00:55:55,274 --> 00:55:56,520
Morse code.

660
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:59,571
We can't use the beacon, she
has control of the ship.

661
00:56:00,321 --> 00:56:01,001
Yeah?

662
00:56:02,136 --> 00:56:04,065
She doesn't have control of this.

663
00:56:13,224 --> 00:56:16,534
General, there's fire on the bridge
of the John A. Warden

664
00:56:16,628 --> 00:56:19,456
Get me a closer look at that ship.

665
00:56:28,108 --> 00:56:29,866
It's morse code.

666
00:56:30,912 --> 00:56:33,296
They're trying to send us a message.

667
00:56:35,044 --> 00:56:37,800
Repeat, bugs in control.

668
00:56:41,623 --> 00:56:44,881
How the hell did bugs
control a Starship?

669
00:56:48,278 --> 00:56:50,614
God damn you Carl.

670
00:56:52,527 --> 00:56:54,613
Deployment status.

671
00:56:55,272 --> 00:56:58,664
Sheraaton, Ishizu Therma and the
Franklin are heading to intercept.

672
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,703
The Sheraaton are taking
catastrophic damage.

673
00:57:50,865 --> 00:57:53,280
The Franklin is critical
but operational.

674
00:57:53,869 --> 00:57:57,854
Franklin, disengage. Get clear
of the John A. Warden.

675
00:58:15,561 --> 00:58:18,163
The John A. Warden is approaching,
on a crash course.

676
00:58:18,601 --> 00:58:20,547
Ready to intercept sir.

677
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:22,774
Main cannon arm and ready.

678
00:58:23,203 --> 00:58:24,672
Carmen...

679
00:58:27,364 --> 00:58:28,520
Carl..

680
00:58:29,078 --> 00:58:30,404
Commander..

681
00:58:34,415 --> 00:58:36,081
Open..

682
00:58:38,803 --> 00:58:39,780
Fire!

683
00:58:47,985 --> 00:58:48,659
Fire!

684
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:51,892
Sir, we can't fire now,
they're too close.

685
00:59:10,901 --> 00:59:12,438
They missed us sir.

686
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:13,558
Yeah..

687
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:15,968
But why?

688
00:59:16,471 --> 00:59:18,360
Commander, I have the
Warden's Trajectory,

689
00:59:18,361 --> 00:59:20,144
it's heading straight
for the earth.

690
00:59:21,567 --> 00:59:23,692
They never meant to ram us.

691
00:59:23,735 --> 00:59:25,534
We were just in their way.

692
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:33,185
This is General Rico to
earth defense command,

693
00:59:33,186 --> 00:59:35,134
the John A. Warden is
under bug control

694
00:59:35,135 --> 00:59:36,693
and entering earth's atmosphere.

695
00:59:37,094 --> 00:59:40,352
It's what? The John A. Warden?

696
00:59:41,608 --> 00:59:45,046
Rico, I don't care if John A. Warden
is on that ship himself.

697
00:59:45,093 --> 00:59:48,125
If that ship is infested,
you take it down.

698
00:59:48,162 --> 00:59:50,188
Just give me a chance to do both sir.

699
00:59:50,221 --> 00:59:53,410
Rescue our men and gain control.

700
00:59:53,445 --> 00:59:54,461
Rico..

701
00:59:54,512 --> 00:59:58,902
Commander, I promise, a bug invasion
will not happen on my watch sir.

702
00:59:59,753 --> 01:00:01,566
It better not!

703
01:00:02,878 --> 01:00:05,909
Space-board command, prepare a drop.

704
01:00:13,836 --> 01:00:14,987
What now?

705
01:00:15,197 --> 01:00:19,338
Daugherty, you stay here
and protect the Captain.

706
01:00:19,597 --> 01:00:22,750
The rest of you, lock and load.

707
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,199
It's time we exterminate that bitch.

708
01:00:41,133 --> 01:00:43,766
She's trying to crash the ship.

709
01:00:47,908 --> 01:00:49,220
Do what you have to do.

710
01:01:03,183 --> 01:01:04,980
I don't know what to do.

711
01:01:11,244 --> 01:01:13,339
Trig, where are you now?

712
01:01:14,814 --> 01:01:16,494
Trig, location.

713
01:01:17,513 --> 01:01:19,083
Trig, come in.

714
01:01:19,627 --> 01:01:21,736
Trig, respond.

715
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:25,418
- Where are you? Trig!
- Central storage area.

716
01:01:25,702 --> 01:01:28,055
- Have you found the queen?
- Oh yeah.

717
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:30,600
This bitch is disgusting.

718
01:01:30,968 --> 01:01:32,757
Take her out.

719
01:01:33,269 --> 01:01:34,089
Done.

720
01:01:34,447 --> 01:01:37,781
We're running out of time,
do you read me?

721
01:01:37,782 --> 01:01:39,564
Loud and clear Captain.

722
01:01:50,978 --> 01:01:51,877
Shit!

723
01:02:11,852 --> 01:02:13,110
That's it.

724
01:02:30,969 --> 01:02:31,633
No.

725
01:02:51,487 --> 01:02:52,424
Shit!

726
01:02:52,858 --> 01:02:53,718
438.

727
01:02:54,702 --> 01:02:55,538
439.

728
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,345
440.

729
01:03:03,205 --> 01:03:04,191
Trig...

730
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,578
All hands prepare for impact.

731
01:03:10,493 --> 01:03:12,867
Magnetic stabilizer disarm.

732
01:04:07,659 --> 01:04:10,331
All hands, report.

733
01:04:12,054 --> 01:04:13,468
Can anybody hear me?

734
01:04:15,488 --> 01:04:16,339
Hero?

735
01:04:17,552 --> 01:04:18,560
Anybody?

736
01:04:28,248 --> 01:04:29,540
Lieutenant..

737
01:04:47,273 --> 01:04:48,659
Thank you.

738
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:08,439
Rico, you're not a trooper
anymore, remember that.

739
01:05:09,178 --> 01:05:10,998
I'm always a trooper.

740
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:14,471
And if there any of our
man alive on that ship,

741
01:05:15,608 --> 01:05:17,346
I'm getting them out.

742
01:05:18,098 --> 01:05:20,387
Should've known you said that.

743
01:05:20,545 --> 01:05:22,412
Kill them anyway you can.

744
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:24,109
Kill them all.

745
01:05:25,478 --> 01:05:29,440
In t-minus 30, we'll send
nukes to sanitize that site.

746
01:05:30,361 --> 01:05:33,142
So be out of there before we hit.

747
01:05:33,865 --> 01:05:38,162
Don't wait for me, if I'm
not out in 30, nuke it.

748
01:05:54,386 --> 01:05:55,331
Ice..

749
01:05:59,453 --> 01:06:00,757
Holy Man...

750
01:06:01,489 --> 01:06:03,363
What the hell kinda bug is that?

751
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:09,498
Fuck me!

752
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,136
I was just starting to believe you.

753
01:06:19,168 --> 01:06:20,839
Fall back, Now!

754
01:06:30,022 --> 01:06:35,133
Troopers, our mission is to storm
the wreck of the John A. Warden,

755
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:38,653
rescue our surviving men

756
01:06:38,668 --> 01:06:41,159
and kill the last every last
son-of-bitch bugs we see.

757
01:06:41,896 --> 01:06:44,597
- Do you understand?
- Yes sir!

758
01:06:44,619 --> 01:06:48,322
We got 25 minutes before
they level that site,

759
01:06:48,323 --> 01:06:49,346
so move fast.

760
01:06:50,059 --> 01:06:51,584
And remember..

761
01:06:51,669 --> 01:06:54,722
We're not fighting for some
rock across the galaxy,

762
01:06:54,894 --> 01:06:57,371
we're fighting for our home.

763
01:06:57,828 --> 01:06:59,571
Commence the attack.

764
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:22,646
Over here..

765
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:24,647
This way?

766
01:07:49,453 --> 01:07:53,032
- Are you alright Captain?
- Yeah. Thanks.

767
01:07:54,467 --> 01:07:57,099
Come on, let's get to the airlock
and get out of here.

768
01:08:00,713 --> 01:08:02,353
That voice..

769
01:08:12,182 --> 01:08:13,752
Approaching...

770
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:15,036
Now!

771
01:08:23,668 --> 01:08:25,111
Come on you aces.

772
01:08:25,148 --> 01:08:26,935
You wanna live forever?

773
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:29,407
Kill them all.

774
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:47,722
She still has the ship.

775
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,120
Ice, you guard the Captain.

776
01:08:54,121 --> 01:08:56,553
The rest of you are
coming with me,

777
01:08:56,554 --> 01:08:59,864
we gonna kill the queen
and take back this ship.

778
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:01,884
Good luck.

779
01:09:07,589 --> 01:09:10,845
Don't worry, you see
your kids again soon.

780
01:09:10,892 --> 01:09:14,541
But those bugs, we're
taking their mama down.

781
01:09:20,834 --> 01:09:21,826
Holy shit!

782
01:09:21,918 --> 01:09:23,059
Take evasive action!

783
01:09:23,142 --> 01:09:25,514
Incoming, burn and turn.

784
01:09:34,222 --> 01:09:35,504
Listen...

785
01:09:36,602 --> 01:09:38,602
It's the engine.

786
01:09:39,392 --> 01:09:42,937
- Mech, still have explosive?
- Some C-4s

787
01:10:12,151 --> 01:10:13,190
Trig...

788
01:10:13,588 --> 01:10:14,885
No..

789
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:17,949
Trig..

790
01:10:18,939 --> 01:10:20,627
Trig!

791
01:10:22,132 --> 01:10:24,547
No...

792
01:10:33,383 --> 01:10:35,282
Ambush.

793
01:10:45,343 --> 01:10:48,117
Go sir, I'll hold them off
for as long as I can.

794
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,649
441.

795
01:10:53,445 --> 01:10:54,527
442.

796
01:10:54,996 --> 01:10:56,277
443.

797
01:10:56,871 --> 01:10:58,691
444.

798
01:11:34,713 --> 01:11:36,206
Damn!

799
01:11:37,673 --> 01:11:39,697
What the hell?

800
01:11:43,605 --> 01:11:46,152
This is what I've been working on.

801
01:11:49,385 --> 01:11:53,844
T-minus 60 to launch,
starting final countdown.

802
01:11:53,932 --> 01:11:57,894
56, 55, 54,

803
01:11:57,895 --> 01:12:01,854
53, 52, 51

804
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:13,567
Carmen, get down!

805
01:12:35,549 --> 01:12:37,074
Johnny..

806
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:40,387
Are there any other survivors?

807
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:42,811
Four more, heading
to kill the queen.

808
01:12:42,998 --> 01:12:44,998
And..

809
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:48,569
Jenkins, you're still alive?

810
01:12:48,621 --> 01:12:52,530
I can't die yet, not until we
won the war at least.

811
01:12:52,621 --> 01:12:55,714
So, by controlling the bugs, you...

812
01:12:55,749 --> 01:12:58,871
I can bring us one step closer
to winning this war.

813
01:12:58,888 --> 01:13:02,286
And I can get you close
enough to kill the queen.

814
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,232
Then, let's get moving.

815
01:13:30,745 --> 01:13:33,456
Let negotiate.

816
01:13:33,632 --> 01:13:35,827
Daugherty?

817
01:13:41,163 --> 01:13:44,003
Surrender Jenkins to us

818
01:13:44,004 --> 01:13:47,459
and we will let you live.

819
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:50,272
They fear me.

820
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,493
Maybe they just think you're an asshole.

821
01:13:52,662 --> 01:13:54,771
Fuck off!

822
01:13:54,826 --> 01:13:57,670
Then, you'll die.

823
01:14:14,507 --> 01:14:17,554
These are the last ones I
can control directly for now.

824
01:14:17,639 --> 01:14:19,863
If I could've finish my research.

825
01:14:19,864 --> 01:14:20,779
Then finish it

826
01:14:21,684 --> 01:14:23,763
So, we can end this.

827
01:14:24,523 --> 01:14:26,634
- Run!
- What?

828
01:14:26,715 --> 01:14:28,965
I said run!

829
01:14:38,545 --> 01:14:42,525
3, 2, 1, launch.

830
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,084
455.

831
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,676
4-5-7.

832
01:14:57,813 --> 01:14:59,774
458.

833
01:14:59,849 --> 01:15:01,881
4-5...

834
01:15:11,582 --> 01:15:12,848
Carl..

835
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:28,734
Johnny Rico...

836
01:15:28,777 --> 01:15:31,293
I should leave you ass
here to get nuked.

837
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,707
What do you mean nuked?

838
01:15:33,735 --> 01:15:34,993
Let's go.

839
01:15:45,148 --> 01:15:47,859
Johnny, the landing ship is here.

840
01:15:49,447 --> 01:15:51,556
I'm coming.

841
01:16:09,094 --> 01:16:11,112
We lost contact with the landing ship.

842
01:16:11,136 --> 01:16:13,191
T-minus 15 till impact.

843
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:24,600
Where's the ship?

844
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,097
No...

845
01:16:48,264 --> 01:16:50,273
They took out the nukes.

846
01:17:03,629 --> 01:17:06,481
S-she's one.

847
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:11,216
- I still have one.
- One what?

848
01:17:11,483 --> 01:17:14,608
The shuttle I use to evacuate from Fort Casey.

849
01:17:14,722 --> 01:17:16,106
Then let's use it.

850
01:17:16,107 --> 01:17:18,184
She'll never let us leave.

851
01:17:22,598 --> 01:17:24,785
You son-of-a-bitch.

852
01:17:25,306 --> 01:17:27,470
Now, that's not nice.

853
01:17:27,891 --> 01:17:28,975
Tell her.

854
01:17:28,976 --> 01:17:31,007
I set explosive on
the main engine.

855
01:17:31,078 --> 01:17:32,187
What?

856
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:37,994
- Mech, still have explosive?
- Some C-4s.

857
01:17:38,312 --> 01:17:40,219
Good..

858
01:17:40,262 --> 01:17:42,431
If we put C-4 in the main engine,

859
01:17:42,432 --> 01:17:45,367
we can blow up the ship
and the queen with it.

860
01:17:45,389 --> 01:17:47,701
- Huh?
- Whoa..

861
01:17:48,904 --> 01:17:51,216
We might not make it out in time.

862
01:17:52,925 --> 01:17:55,487
At least they won't.

863
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:58,726
Okay..

864
01:17:58,852 --> 01:18:01,125
Then do it.

865
01:18:01,337 --> 01:18:05,712
- Ratazz, watch his back.
- Yes sir!

866
01:18:07,955 --> 01:18:10,565
So the extraction team been wiped out?

867
01:18:11,726 --> 01:18:14,141
Just 10 minutes left.

868
01:18:16,913 --> 01:18:18,968
Johnny what're you doing?

869
01:18:21,074 --> 01:18:23,684
Get to the shuttle!

870
01:18:25,454 --> 01:18:26,150
Johnny...

871
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:29,487
Let's go.

872
01:18:29,868 --> 01:18:31,555
Follow me.

873
01:18:50,566 --> 01:18:51,855
Shit!

874
01:19:04,428 --> 01:19:05,944
Are you Varro?

875
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:07,438
Yes sir!

876
01:19:07,692 --> 01:19:09,192
Where's Jenkins?

877
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:10,438
He's safe.

878
01:19:13,224 --> 01:19:14,546
Varro!

879
01:19:16,011 --> 01:19:17,433
Good..

880
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:22,493
Make sure he keep everybody
else that way.

881
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:06,991
He did it.

882
01:21:07,059 --> 01:21:08,809
59 seconds.

883
01:21:08,878 --> 01:21:09,824
Where's Johnny?

884
01:21:27,855 --> 01:21:30,736
Captain, take us home.

885
01:21:30,784 --> 01:21:32,191
Aye, aye, sir.

886
01:21:50,317 --> 01:21:52,551
You're going to do it or what?

887
01:21:55,062 --> 01:21:59,299
3, 2, 1,

888
01:21:59,338 --> 01:22:00,415
BOOM!

889
01:22:52,303 --> 01:22:53,690
I thought the good guys

890
01:22:53,691 --> 01:22:56,162
and hot girls always
survive in the end.

891
01:22:57,453 --> 01:22:58,797
No..

892
01:22:59,196 --> 01:23:01,204
Not all of them.

893
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:04,291
He's to the dead.

894
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:06,433
And to the next man to die.

895
01:23:14,271 --> 01:23:16,115
I hope you feel better.

896
01:23:16,182 --> 01:23:21,268
Do you realize, that you not only
destroy my ship, and kill my crew,

897
01:23:21,268 --> 01:23:25,689
but you also put the entire
planet at risk for infestation?

898
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:28,700
My apologies for your loss.

899
01:23:28,797 --> 01:23:31,476
But my research is going
to save an entire galaxy.

900
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:35,137
Just like I saved you.

901
01:23:39,049 --> 01:23:40,369
It was you..

902
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:43,118
You told me how to find Hero.

903
01:23:44,704 --> 01:23:46,736
Well, that's classified.

904
01:23:46,832 --> 01:23:50,629
You see, nothing can stop us when
3 of us are working together.

905
01:23:50,695 --> 01:23:52,367
Are we Carl?

906
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:53,808
Pardon me?

907
01:23:53,856 --> 01:23:56,176
Are we working together?

908
01:23:57,912 --> 01:24:00,175
Cheer up Johnny, you're a Hero.

909
01:24:00,176 --> 01:24:01,841
No.

910
01:24:01,938 --> 01:24:03,547
No I'm not.

911
01:24:05,042 --> 01:24:07,105
But I've met one.
