1
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,133
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,350
- Can I see?
- Finders keepers. And I found it.

3
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,061
In my garden.

4
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,606
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,073
Bruce?

6
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,788
Bruce?

7
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,584
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,692
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,028
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,867
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,850
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,852
- Again?
- Until they kill you.

13
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,856
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,069
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,159
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,997
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,540
You're practice.

18
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,293
Solitary.

19
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,378
- Why?
- For protection.

20
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,423
- I don't need protection.
- Protection for them.

21
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,095
Get in.

22
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,310
Are you so
desperate to fight criminals...

23
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,979
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,109
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,570
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,575
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,828
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,289
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,624
Who are you?

30
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,961
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,756
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,508
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,928
What makes you think I need a path?

34
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,931
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

35
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,475
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,103
...but whatever
your original intentions...

37
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,148
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,487
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,658
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,036
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,622
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,003
- You're vigilantes.
- No, no, no.

43
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,340
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:04,177
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:10,350
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,520
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,189
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,026
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,237
Which is?

50
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,699
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,660
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,247
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,876
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,711
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,839
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,925
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,845
And what was I looking for?

58
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,515
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,294
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,906
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,709
Wait.

62
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,214
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,925
I seek...

64
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,720
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,223
To turn fear...

66
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,392
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,167
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,421
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,757
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,261
I can.... I can barely stand.

71
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,763
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

72
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,100
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:25,230
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,443
Tiger.

75
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,863
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,117
Panther.

77
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,956
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,963
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,801
But not of me.

80
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,765
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,440
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,992
Bruce?

83
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,164
It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,832
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,501
Will we be needing
an ambulance, Master Wayne?

86
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,546
No, l'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,964
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:37,135
- l'm very sorry, sir. I've told --
- Don't worry. lt's fine.

89
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,723
Took quite a fall,
didn't we, Master Bruce?

90
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,058
And why do we fall?

91
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,311
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,942
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,745
The bats again?

94
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,042
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,587
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

96
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,756
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,257
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,259
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,428
I got something to show you.

100
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,103
- You think your mother will like them?
- Yeah.

101
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,939
- I think it's time to get up.
- Maybe.

102
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,732
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,071
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:42,951
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,621
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,750
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,627
And at the center...

108
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,629
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,632
- ls that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.

110
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,052
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,096
- Better?
- Well...

112
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,473
...more interested men.

113
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,323
Can we go?

114
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,202
Please.

115
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,829
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,883
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, no. It was me.

117
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,219
I just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,555
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,894
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,068
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,736
That's fine.
Fast.

122
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,573
Take it easy.

123
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,867
Here you go.

124
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,414
It's fine. It's fine.

125
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,418
Now just take it and go.

126
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,920
- I said, jewelry.
- Hey --

127
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,799
Thomas!

128
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,433
Bruce.

129
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,437
It's okay.

130
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,317
Don't be afraid.

131
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,934
Is this your father's?

132
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,605
It's okay.

133
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,441
Come here.

134
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,362
There you go.

135
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:15,163
It's okay.

136
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,668
Gordon.

137
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,345
Hey.

138
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,180
Good news.

139
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,516
We got him, son.

140
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,039
You're in excellent hands.

141
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,874
We'll be watching the empire.

142
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,044
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

143
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,188
I thought I might prepare a little supper.

144
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,445
- Very well.
- Alfred?

145
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,410
- Yes, Master Bruce?
- lt was my fault, Alfred.

146
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,245
- I made them leave the theater.
- No.

147
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,456
- lf I hadn't gotten scared....
- lt was nothing that you did.

148
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,919
It was him, and him alone.

149
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,921
Do you understand?

150
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,094
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

151
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,263
So do l, Master Bruce.

152
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,933
So do l.

153
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,063
And do you still feel
responsible for your parents' death?

154
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,274
My anger outweighs my guilt.

155
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,443
Come.

156
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,783
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

157
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,037
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

158
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,502
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

159
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,630
You know how to disappear.

160
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,008
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

161
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,303
Invisible?

162
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,978
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

163
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,659
Always mind your surroundings.

164
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,040
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

165
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,794
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.

166
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,296
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

167
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,800
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

168
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,179
- Who is he?
- He was a farmer.

169
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,641
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

170
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,102
- Now he is a prisoner.
- What'll happen to him?

171
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,687
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

172
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,817
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

173
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,698
Your parents' death was not your fault.

174
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,250
It was your father's.

175
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,023
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

176
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,401
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?

177
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,403
I've had training.

178
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,405
The training is nothing!

179
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,240
Will is everything!

180
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,873
The will to act.

181
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,884
Yield.

182
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,594
You haven't beaten me.

183
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,430
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

184
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,898
Rub your chest.

185
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,276
Your arms will take care of themselves.

186
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,572
You are stronger than your father.

187
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,866
You didn't know my father.

188
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,285
But I know the rage that drives you.

189
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,787
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

190
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,624
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

191
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,792


...poison in your veins.

192
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,422
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

193
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,301
...so you'd be spared your pain.

194
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,682
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

195
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,311
Once, I had a wife.

196
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,231
My great love.

197
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,484
She was taken from me.

198
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,904
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

199
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,324
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

200
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,495
Your anger gives you great power.

201
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,499
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

202
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,334
...as it almost did me.

203
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,963
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.

204
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,006
That's no help to me.

205
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,008
Why, Bruce?

206
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,844
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

207
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,143
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

208
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,980
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

209
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,357
I'm not heading back at all.

210
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,609
- You don't like it there?
- I like it fine.

211
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,779
They just don't feel the same way.

212
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,200
- l've prepared the master bedroom.
- No.

213
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,827
My room will be fine.

214
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,705
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

215
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,707
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

216
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,042
- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.

217
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,296
If I have my way, l'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

218
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,550
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

219
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,386
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

220
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,141
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

221
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,977
...for what was most precious to him...

222
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,396
...in the whole world.

223
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,901
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

224
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,070
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

225
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,741
Should I just bury the past
out there with my parents, Alfred?

226
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,994
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

227
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:14,206
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

228
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,084
Haven't given up on me yet?

229
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,253
Never.

230
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,680
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

231
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,974
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

232
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,810
Old habits die hard, I guess.

233
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,437
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.

234
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,481
How's your mom?

235
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,150
She misses this place.

236
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,153
So do l.

237
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,822
Yeah.

238
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,991
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

239
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,161
- Now there's only Alfred.
- And you.

240
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,873
- l'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.

241
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,673
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

242
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,510
Someone at this proceeding...

243
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,346
...should stand for my parents.

244
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,640
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

245
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,018
- What Chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?

246
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,648
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

247
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,485
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

248
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,321
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

249
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,033
I cannot let that pass.

250
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,036
And I need you
to understand that, please.

251
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,039
Okay.

252
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,461
The depression hit working
people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

253
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,839
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

254
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,841
...but by desperation.

255
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,887
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

256
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,723
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

257
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,018
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

258
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,313
Mr. Chill?

259
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,568
Your Honor...

260
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,572
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

261
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,411
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

262
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,955
...but that don't change what I did.

263
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:08,255
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

264
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,716
Has he got anything to say?

265
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,275
- He's coming out the side!
- He's coming out the side, guys!

266
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,245
Bruce Wayne!

267
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,290
Joe! Hey, Joe!

268
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,458
Falcone says hi.

269
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,887
Come on, Bruce.

270
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,889
We don't need to see this.

271
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,141
I do.

272
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,732
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden insisted...

273
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,317
...on making the hearing public.

274
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,903
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

275
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,321
Maybe I should thank them.

276
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,116
- You don't mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?

277
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,159
My parents deserved justice.

278
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,288
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

279
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,332
- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same.

280
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,086
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.

281
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,548
- lt's why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.

282
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,474
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

283
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,351
This city is rotting.

284
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,313
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. lt's not.

285
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,981
Things are worse than ever here.

286
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,692
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

287
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,820
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

288
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,531
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

289
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,659
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

290
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:08,083
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

291
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,005
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

292
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,299
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

293
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,720
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.

294
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,599
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

295
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,895
- l'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?

296
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,192
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

297
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,569
Now I can't.

298
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,128
Your father would be ashamed of you.

299
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:39,133
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

300
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,468
No gun? l'm insulted.

301
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:48,434
- You could've just sent a thank-you note.
- I didn't come here to thank you.

302
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,311
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

303
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,147
Only those who know me, kid.

304
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,983
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

305
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,153
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

306
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,155
...and a judge.

307
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:05,659
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.

308
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,495
Now, that's power you can't buy.

309
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,622
That's the power of fear.

310
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,291
I'm not afraid of you.

311
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,334
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

312
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,170
But you haven't thought it through.

313
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,465
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

314
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,676
You haven't thought about
your old butler. Bang!

315
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,515
People from your world...

316
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,018
...have so much to lose.

317
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:35,522
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

318
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,692
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

319
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,986
You've never tasted desperate.

320
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,697
You're.... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

321
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,284
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

322
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,705
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

323
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,041
This is a world you'll never understand.

324
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,210
And you always fear...

325
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,837
...what you don't understand.

326
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,050
All right.

327
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,560
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

328
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,729
More than your old man anyway.

329
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:20,192
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

330
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,569
He said your father begged for mercy.

331
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,697
Begged.

332
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,241
Like a dog.

333
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,880
Should've tipped better.

334
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,725
- For what?
- Your jacket.

335
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,894
Okay.

336
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,440
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

337
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,734
Be careful who sees you with that.

338
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,237
- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?

339
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,406
Everyone.

340
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,451
It's....

341
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,620
It's a nice coat.

342
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:36,310
When you lived among
the criminals, did you start to pity them?

343
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:40,147
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn't starve, yes.

344
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:45,819
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.

345
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,156
And when I traveled...

346
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,075
...I learned the fear before a crime...

347
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,412
...and the thrill of success.

348
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,166
But I never became one of them.

349
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,130
Fool. What do I care
what your name is? You're a criminal.

350
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,965
I'm not a criminal

351
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,301
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

352
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,514
You've traveled the world
to understand the criminal mind...

353
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,974
...and conquer your fears.

354
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:22,189
But a criminal is not complicated.

355
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,692
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

356
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,362
You fear your own power.

357
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,863
You fear your anger...

358
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:34,534
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

359
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:38,205
Now you must journey inwards.

360
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,044
You are ready.

361
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:57,891
Breathe.

362
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,731
Breathe in your fears.

363
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,402
Face them.

364
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,698
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

365
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:16,243
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

366
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,081
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

367
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,226
You have to become a terrible thought.

368
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,940
A wraith.

369
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,073
You have to become an idea!

370
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:05,000
Feel terror cloud your senses.

371
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,963
Feel its power to distort.

372
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,133
To control.

373
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,015
And know that this power
can be yours.

374
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,238
Embrace your worst fear.

375
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,539
Become one with the darkness.

376
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,061
Focus.

377
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,522
Concentrate.

378
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,816
Master your senses.

379
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,346
You cannot leave any sign.

380
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,889
I haven't.

381
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,233
Impressive.

382
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,411
We have purged your fear.

383
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,205
You are ready to lead these men.

384
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,917
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

385
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,716
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

386
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,775
No.

387
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,570
I'm no executioner.

388
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:42,782
Your compassion is
a weakness your enemies will not share.

389
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,452
That's why it's so important.

390
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,454
It separates us from them.

391
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,956
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

392
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,042
- This man should be tried.
- By whom?

393
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,793
Corrupt bureaucrats?

394
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,463
Criminals mock society's laws.

395
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,965
You know this better than most.

396
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,469
You cannot lead these men...

397
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,640
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

398
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,643
And where would I be leading
these men?

399
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,478
Gotham.

400
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,647
As Gotham's favored son...

401
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:18,193
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

402
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,322
- How?
- Gotham's time has come.

403
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,825
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...

404
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:30,163
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

405
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:34,000
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

406
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:39,339
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

407
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,717
It is one we've performed for centuries.

408
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,803
Gotham...

409
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,847
...must be destroyed.

410
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,686
You can't believe in this.

411
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:57,440
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

412
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:02,028
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

413
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,532
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

414
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,326
...but I will not become an executioner.

415
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,036
Bruce, please.

416
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:13,039
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

417
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,907
- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.

418
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,505
I will tell him you saved his life.

419
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,735
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

420
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,237
- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.

421
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,240
Apart from the mud.

422
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,160
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

423
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,578
As long as it takes.

424
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,246
I want to show the people...

425
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:43,833
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

426
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,212
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

427
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,588
...combating poverty.

428
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:53,259
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

429
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,220
Did it?

430
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,764
In a way.

431
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:01,059
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

432
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,105
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

433
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,941
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

434
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,609
As a man...

435
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,237
...l'm flesh and blood,
I can be ignored, destroyed.

436
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,280
But as a symbol....

437
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,451
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

438
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,246
- I can be everlasting.
- What symbol?

439
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,457
Something elemental...

440
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,292
...something terrifying.

441
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,586
I assume that as you take on
the underworld...

442
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:33,883
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

443
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,426
You're thinking about Rachel?

444
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,971
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

445
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,724
Have you told anyone l'm coming back?

446
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:46,145
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

447
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,147
- Dead?
- You've been gone seven years.

448
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,649
You had me declared dead?

449
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,652
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

450
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,113
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

451
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,657
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

452
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,535
Well, it's a good thing
I left everything to you, then.

453
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,662
Quite so, sir.

454
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,624
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

455
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:21,347
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

456
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:26,352
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

457
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:31,190
- Dr. Crane.
- Miss Dawes.

458
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,694
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

459
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,530
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would l?

460
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,783
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

461
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,368
...and moved into your asylum.

462
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:47,206
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

463
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,710
Or the corrupt.

464
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,589
Mr. Finch.

465
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,716
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

466
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:01,220
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. lf any.

467
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,560
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, Carl?

468
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,103
Looking out for you.

469
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,525
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

470
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,736
- Drop it.
- How can you say that?

471
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:20,573
Because as much as I care about
getting Falcone, I care more about you.

472
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,075
That's sweet.

473
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,874
We've been through all that.

474
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,402
Blessed bat again, sir.

475
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,279
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

476
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,858
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

477
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,986
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

478
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,530
I'm bringing in the shipments.

479
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,406
We are paying you for that.

480
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,076
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

481
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:17,416
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

482
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:20,670
But you know who l'm working for,
and when he gets here --

483
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,755
He -- He's coming to Gotham?

484
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,382
Yes, he is.

485
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,009
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

486
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:32,265
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

487
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,602
- Who's bothering you?
- There's a girl at the DA's office.

488
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,896
- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.

489
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,941
Idealist, huh?

490
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,818
Well, there's an answer to that too.

491
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,113
- I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.

492
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,787
No, we are showing
very healthy growth in these sectors.

493
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,124
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

494
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,459
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

495
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:05,631
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

496
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:09,135
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

497
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,138
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

498
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,140
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

499
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,643
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

500
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:21,147
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

501
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,815
Name?

502
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,942
Bruce Wayne.

503
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,323
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

504
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,577
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

505
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,829
Jessica?

506
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,458
Jessica? Where are you?

507
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:44,879
- Eye on the ball, and....
- Why is no one answering the phone?

508
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,674
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

509
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,510
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

510
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,679
I'm sorry to disappoint.

511
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,515
- I need you to take a look at this.
- Have you seen him yet?

512
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,392
- Who?
- Wayne.

513
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,811
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

514
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,652
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

515
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,028
Too many wheels turning.

516
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,197
- We're going public.
- I understand.

517
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,533
And l'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

518
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,203
I'm not looking to interfere.

519
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,830
- I am looking for a job.
- Oh?

520
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:23,042
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

521
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,127
Any ideas where you would start?

522
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,005
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

523
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,049
Fox's department.

524
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,218
I'll let him know you're coming.

525
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,930
You look like him. Your dad.

526
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,392
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

527
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,521
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

528
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:48,359
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

529
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,570
All prototypes. None in production.

530
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,407
- On any level whatsoever.
- None?

531
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,243
What did they tell you this place was?

532
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,453
They didn't tell me anything.

533
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:05,376
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

534
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,253
Dead end.

535
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,756
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

536
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,259
Come on.

537
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,886
- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things.

538
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,930
- You knew my father?
- Oh, yeah.

539
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,765
Helped him build his train.

540
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,976
Here we are.

541
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,273
Kevlar utility harness.

542
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,608
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

543
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,111
The 350-pound test monofilament.

544
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,616
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

545
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:42,747
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

546
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:46,125
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

547
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,961
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

548
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,965
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

549
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,926
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

550
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,637
- Tear- resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.

551
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,973
- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.

552
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,060
- Why didn't they put it into production?
- Bean counters didn't think...

553
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,604
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

554
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,150
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

555
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,319
I want to borrow it.

556
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,279
For spelunking.

557
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,448
Spelunking?

558
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,325
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

559
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,287
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

560
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,834
Look, l'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing --

561
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,294
Mr. Wayne...

562
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,421
...the way I see it...

563
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,341
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

564
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,805
Okay. Give it a try.

565
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,185
Charming.

566
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,815
At least you'll have company.

567
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:56,695
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

568
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:13,337
Your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the Underground Railroad...

569
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:16,507
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

570
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,386
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

571
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,234
Alfred! Come up here!

572
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,404
I can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

573
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,093
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

574
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,761
Via a dummy corporation.

575
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,763
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

576
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:09,894
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

577
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,397
- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.

578
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:17,610
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

579
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,279
- How large?
- Say 10,000.

580
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:25,743
- Well, at least we'll have spares.
- Yes.

581
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,929
Don't suppose you want a taste.

582
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:48,265
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

583
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,601
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

584
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,146
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

585
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,148
I'm no rat.

586
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,613
In a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

587
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,436
Don't turn around.

588
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:38,107
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

589
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,858
What do you want?

590
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,195
Carmine Falcone brings
in shipments of drugs every week.

591
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,197
Nobody takes him down. Why?

592
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,742
He's paid up with the right people.

593
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,829
What will it take to bring him down?

594
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,957
Leverage on Judge Faden...

595
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,043
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

596
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,045
Rachel Dawes.

597
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,755
Who are you?

598
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,841
Watch for my sign.

599
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,554
You're just one man?

600
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,389
Now we're two.

601
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,059
We?

602
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,493
Freeze!

603
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,596
What the hell was that?

604
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,725
Just some nut.

605
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,939
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

606
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,609
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

607
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,819
BASE-jumping.

608
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,947
- That like parachuting?
- Kind of.

609
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,951
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

610
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,788
You know, I think I have just the thing.

611
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,583
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

612
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,797
Regularly flexible...

613
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,341
...but put a current through it...

614
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:32,471
...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
- What kind of shapes can you make?

615
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,808
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

616
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,142
Too expensive for the Army?

617
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:42,106
I don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

618
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,066
- Look, Mr. Fox.
- Yes, sir?

619
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,110
If you're uncomfortable --

620
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,488
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

621
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,615
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

622
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,953
But don't think of me as an idiot.

623
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,415
Fair enough.

624
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,168
What's that?

625
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,172
The Tumbler?

626
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,633
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

627
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,516
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

628
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,981
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

629
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:30,154
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

630
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,906
This will boost you into a rampless jump --
Not now!

631
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,870
Not -- Not now, sir.

632
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,541
Afterburner disengaged.

633
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,003
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

634
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,880
...but this baby works just fine.

635
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,682
So, what do you think?

636
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,935
Does it come in black?

637
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,938
I need you at the docks Thursday.

638
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,065
- Problems?
- I don't want any trouble...

639
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,359
...with the last shipment.
-Sure.

640
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:14,573
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

641
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,201
- ls that right?
- And that there's a fat prize...

642
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:20,078
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

643
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,206
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

644
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,916
Have you seen the girl?

645
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,085
It's a cute little assistant DA.

646
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,923
Don't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?

647
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,426
- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham City.

648
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,429
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

649
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,224
Sometimes --
Sometimes things just go bad.

650
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,896
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

651
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,774
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

652
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,527
- At least they gave us a discount.
- Quite.

653
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:57,282
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

654
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,321
Why bats, Master Wayne?

655
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:37,823
Bats frighten me.

656
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:41,451
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

657
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,063
What is this?

658
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,193
Continue.

659
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,367
Looks fine out there.

660
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,703
The bears go straight to the dealers.

661
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,539
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

662
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,709
- What's the difference?
- lgnorance is bliss, my friend.

663
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:34,046
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

664
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,898
Hey. Steiss.

665
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,671
Steiss?

666
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,226
What?

667
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,436
What the...?

668
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,280
I better check it.

669
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,795
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

670
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,492
Where are you?!

671
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,660
Here.

672
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:53,351
Take a ride. Oh, shit.

673
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:13,288
What the hell are you?

674
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:17,876
I'm Batman.

675
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,178
Nice coat.

676
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,389
Thanks.

677
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:13,723
Hold it.

678
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,311
That's right, you better run.

679
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,114
Falcone sent them to kill you.

680
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:32,826
- Why?
- You rattled his cage.

681
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,123
- What's this?
- Leverage.

682
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:39,958
- For what?
- To get things moving.

683
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,252
Who are you?

684
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:43,879
Someone like you.

685
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,089
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

686
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:54,639
Ma'am? Everything okay?

687
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,479
- Falcone's men?
- Does it matter?

688
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:03,940
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

689
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,276
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

690
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:21,166
What the hell is that?

691
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,010
Cut him down.

692
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,867
Unacceptable.

693
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,870
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

694
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,997
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

695
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,541
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

696
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:06,336
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

697
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:09,214
It was some asshole in a costume.

698
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,383
- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...

699
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:14,344
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

700
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:18,014
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

701
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,391
Understand?

702
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:22,394
- No way to bury it now.
- There's still Judge Faden.

703
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:25,522
- l've got Faden covered.
- What about this bat they babble about?

704
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,692
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

705
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:31,027
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

706
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:34,406
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

707
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,366
Okay. Let's do it.

708
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:41,913
- Bats are nocturnal.
- Bats may be.

709
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:45,500
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

710
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,421
The price for leading a double life,
I fear.

711
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:53,174
Your theatrics made an impression.

712
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:57,595
Theatricality and deception...

713
01:06:57,763 --> 01:07:00,932
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

714
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,935
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

715
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,938
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

716
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,606
Polo, for instance.

717
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:10,442
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

718
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:14,362
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

719
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,947
These things beg the question...

720
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:20,410
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

721
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,120
What does someone like me do?

722
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:27,292
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

723
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,586
Buy things that are not for sale.

724
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:33,298
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

725
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,925
...you might even have a little
by accident.

726
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:40,096
Sir.

727
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,599
- We have a situation.
- All right.

728
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,811
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

729
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:52,150
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

730
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,571
The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.

731
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,573
It's a microwave emitter.

732
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,659
It's designed for desert warfare, but it --

733
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,954
It looks like somebody...

734
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,835
...turned it on.

735
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:19,469
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

736
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:30,355
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.

737
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,525
The weapon itself is....

738
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,319
Missing?

739
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:38,363
Yeah.

740
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:41,658
Mr. Wayne.

741
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,830
Nice car.

742
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,373
You should see my other one.

743
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:00,343
He's done something
the police never have.

744
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:02,804
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

745
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,557
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

746
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:08,059
Bruce, help me out here.
- Huh?

747
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:12,564
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

748
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:15,817
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

749
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,361
Now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?

750
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,737
They're jealous.

751
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:22,574
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

752
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:26,119
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

753
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,914
Well, they're European.

754
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,127
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

755
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:38,506
- lt is not a question of money.
- Well, you see...

756
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,884
...l'm buying this hotel...

757
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:47,098
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

758
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,602
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

759
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:52,937
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

760
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,029
Thank you.

761
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:04,115
Bruce?

762
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,454
Rachel?

763
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,080
I'd heard you were back.

764
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,626
What are you doing?

765
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:19,797
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

766
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:21,466
You were gone a long time.

767
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:24,969
- I know. How are things?
- The same.

768
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,598
Job's getting worse.

769
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:31,476
Can't change the world on your own.

770
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,728
What choice do I have...

771
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:36,147
...when you're too busy swimming?

772
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,484
Rachel, all of --

773
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:41,486
All this....

774
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:46,950
It's -- It's not me. lt's....

775
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,994
Inside, I am....

776
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,164
I am more.

777
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,333
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

778
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:59,337
Bruce, we have
some more hotels for you to buy.

779
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,839
Bruce...

780
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:06,511
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

781
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,516
But it's not who you are underneath...

782
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,726
...it's what you do that defines you.

783
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,865
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

784
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:30,868
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

785
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:34,706
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen....

786
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:37,875
Of course, better safe than sorry.

787
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,882
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

788
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,510
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

789
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:50,555
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

790
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,224
- What do you want?
- I wanna know...

791
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,893
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

792
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:58,229
About what?
You don't know anything.

793
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:02,567
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

794
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:06,904
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

795
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:10,742
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

796
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:14,245
And those goons you used.

797
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,247
I own the muscle in this town.

798
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:19,792
Now, l've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

799
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:24,547
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

800
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,926
Well, I already know what he'll say.

801
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:30,762
That we should kill you.

802
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,933
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

803
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,441
Would you like to see my mask?

804
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:46,444
I use it in my experiments.

805
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:53,409
Now, l'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

806
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,621
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

807
01:12:57,414 --> 01:12:59,457
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

808
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,544
They scream and they cry...

809
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,755
...much as you're doing now.

810
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:11,302
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

811
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,971
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

812
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:17,600
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

813
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:41,124
Storm's coming.

814
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:48,673
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

815
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:52,427
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

816
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:55,304
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

817
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:59,475
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

818
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:01,519
Why? What about the other half?

819
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,439
- Flass knows.
- He won't talk.

820
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:06,649
He'll talk to me.

821
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,861
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

822
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,864
- He thinks you're dangerous.
- What do you think?

823
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:17,034
I think you're trying to help.

824
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,375
But l've been wrong before.

825
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,883
Come on, I ain't got all night.

826
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,054
Flass, I have kids to feed.

827
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:39,682
What, they don't like falafel?

828
01:14:55,073 --> 01:14:56,741
Where were the other drugs going?

829
01:14:58,076 --> 01:15:00,244
I never knew. I don't know.

830
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:02,580
- I swear to God.
- Swear to me!

831
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:11,255
I don't -- I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

832
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:14,967
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

833
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,469
Why?

834
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:20,723
There was something --
Something else in the drugs...

835
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:22,433
..something hidden.
- What?

836
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:25,937
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

837
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:29,440
- Cops only go there in force.
- Do I look like a cop?

838
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:31,400
No --!

839
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:47,041
This is the one l'm talking about.

840
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:49,627
- What's your problem with it?
- lt shouldn't exist.

841
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:53,631
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

842
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:56,217
I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

843
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:59,762
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

844
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:03,266
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

845
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:13,818
What the hell is this?

846
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,864
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

847
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,199
Get in here!

848
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:04,952
The other kids won't believe me.

849
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,186
Get rid of all traces.

850
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,397
- Better torch the whole place.
- All right.

851
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:11,227
Having trouble?

852
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,271
Take a seat. Have a drink.

853
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:18,234
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

854
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,949
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

855
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:20,629
Alfred, help me.

856
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:33,851
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.

857
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:37,021
Poisonous. Poisonous.

858
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:43,027
Bruce...

859
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:45,529
...why do we fall?

860
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:00,878
- How long was I out?
- Two days.

861
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:03,130
It's your birthday.

862
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:05,716
Many happy returns.

863
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:14,725
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

864
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:19,480
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

865
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,566
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

866
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:25,861
I called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

867
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:27,404
I analyzed your blood...

868
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:31,075
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

869
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,035
Am I meant to understand any of that?

870
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:36,580
Not at all. I just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

871
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:40,876
- Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
- Could you make more?

872
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:43,587
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

873
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:47,007
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

874
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:49,927
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens....

875
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:53,556
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

876
01:20:53,723 --> 01:20:56,100
Alfred, always a pleasure.

877
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:57,935
Lucius.

878
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,109
- You sure you don't want to come in?
- I have to get back.

879
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:06,944
- I wanted to leave this.
- Thank you.

880
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,529
Rachel?

881
01:21:09,906 --> 01:21:13,117
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

882
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,953
- Must've been quite an occasion.
- lt is my birthday.

883
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:19,790
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

884
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:23,377
- You've got better plans?
- My boss has been missing for days...

885
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,880
...which means I should
probably start by looking...

886
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:27,798
...at the bottom of the river.
- Rachel.

887
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:30,342
Excuse me.

888
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,137
Rachel Dawes.

889
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:37,308
Who authorized that? Get Crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.

890
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:41,395
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.

891
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:43,647
- What's wrong?
- lt's Falcone.

892
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:46,317
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

893
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:49,486
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

894
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,573
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

895
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,492
- Some of us have work to do.
- You be careful.

896
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,829
Happy birthday.

897
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:20,351
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

898
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:22,144
Keep them happy until I arrive.

899
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,521
Tell them that joke you know.

900
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:05,062
Having fun?

901
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:10,734
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

902
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:12,236
I need some information.

903
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:17,199
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1-ME.

904
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:19,994
1-ME.

905
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:23,914
It's a microwave emitter. lt was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

906
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:28,252
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

907
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:30,421
...but isn't that illegal?

908
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:36,385
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

909
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:40,556
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

910
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:42,599
Did you lose one?

911
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:47,271
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

912
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:49,773
And I am firing you.

913
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:53,902
Didn't you get the memo?

914
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:02,786
Scarecrow.

915
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:12,629
Scarecrow.

916
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:17,801
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

917
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,929
I have nothing to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

918
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:23,307
- I have questions about your report.
- Such as?

919
01:24:23,516 --> 01:24:27,811
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

920
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:31,607
...to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

921
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:36,028
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

922
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:42,076
- Scarecrow.
- What's "scarecrow"?

923
01:24:42,535 --> 01:24:46,163
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

924
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:48,457
...on an external tormentor...

925
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:51,835
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

926
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:54,463
In this case, a scarecrow.

927
01:24:55,924 --> 01:25:00,010
- He's drugged?
- Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

928
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:02,137
I'm a strong advocate.

929
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:04,681
Outside, he was a giant.

930
01:25:04,849 --> 01:25:07,351
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

931
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:09,269
You enjoy the reversal.

932
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:12,439
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

933
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:14,149
It's why I do what I do.

934
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:19,196
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

935
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:22,699
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

936
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:26,203
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

937
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:28,872
- First thing tomorrow, then.
- Tonight.

938
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,501
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

939
01:25:33,878 --> 01:25:35,712
As you wish.

940
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:43,178
This way, please.

941
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:45,973
There's something
I think you should see.

942
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:59,486
This is where we make the medicine.

943
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:10,205
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

944
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,065
Who knows you're here?

945
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:39,735
Who knows?

946
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:48,202
He's here.

947
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:49,620
Who?

948
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:51,747
The Batman.

949
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:55,459
- What do we do?
- What anyone does...

950
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:58,420
...when a prowler comes around.

951
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:01,924
- Call the police.
- You want the cops here?

952
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:05,260
At this point, they can't stop us.

953
01:27:05,428 --> 01:27:08,972
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

954
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:12,226
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

955
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:14,645
- What about her?
- She hasn't got long.

956
01:27:14,812 --> 01:27:16,772
I gave her a concentrated dose.

957
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,483
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

958
01:27:21,986 --> 01:27:24,321
The things they say about him.

959
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,989
Can he really fly?

960
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:28,283
I heard he can disappear.

961
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:31,495
Well, we'll find out.

962
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:33,413
Won't we?

963
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,879
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

964
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:31,388
What have you been doing here?

965
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:36,893
Who are you working for?

966
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,692
Ra's -- Ra's al Ghul.

967
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:48,739
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

968
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:49,906
Crane.

969
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:55,370
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

970
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:57,831
But if you'd like to make
an appointment....

971
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:13,764
Batman, put down your
weapons and surrender.

972
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:15,891
You're surrounded.

973
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:24,232
- What are you waiting for?
- Backup.

974
01:29:24,942 --> 01:29:27,361
- Backup?
- The Batman's in there.

975
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:29,696
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

976
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:31,406
...l'll be right behind you, sir.

977
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:34,451
SWAT's on the way.

978
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:36,828
- Hey.
- Hey.

979
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:20,997
What's happened to her?

980
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:27,504
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

981
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:33,260
- Let me get her down to the medics.
- They can't help her, but I can.

982
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:39,349
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

983
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:50,193
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

984
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:52,529
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

985
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,698
- What was he planning?
- I don't know.

986
01:30:54,907 --> 01:30:56,199
Was he working for Falcone?

987
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:59,202
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

988
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:01,997
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

989
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:04,374
- How long does she have?
- Not long.

990
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:10,046
What is that?

991
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:13,717
- Backup.
- What the --?

992
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:33,463
Excuse me.

993
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:41,471
- How is she?
- She's fading. We gotta go.

994
01:32:43,307 --> 01:32:44,766
I'll get my car.

995
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:46,768
I brought mine.

996
01:32:47,144 --> 01:32:48,812
Yours?

997
01:32:58,114 --> 01:32:59,948
I've gotta get me one of those.

998
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:01,783
He is in a vehicle.

999
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:03,451
Make and color?

1000
01:33:03,619 --> 01:33:05,829
It's a black...

1001
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:08,498
...tank.

1002
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:12,502
Stay calm.

1003
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:14,963
You've been poisoned.

1004
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:19,009
I'm on him.

1005
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:28,476
Breathe slowly.

1006
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:39,696
Hold on.

1007
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,545
- What are you doing?
- Shortcut.

1008
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,348
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1009
01:34:10,394 --> 01:34:12,020
He's got no way off that roof.

1010
01:34:13,397 --> 01:34:16,524
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1011
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:21,655
- Trust me.
Weapons system activated.

1012
01:34:39,548 --> 01:34:40,590
Who is this guy?

1013
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,258
Where's he going?

1014
01:34:42,426 --> 01:34:43,635
He's on the roof.

1015
01:34:57,274 --> 01:34:59,943
- What street is he taking?
- He's not on a street.

1016
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:01,403
He's flying on rooftops.

1017
01:35:40,609 --> 01:35:42,819
At least tell me what it looks like.

1018
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:47,323
Never mind.

1019
01:35:51,203 --> 01:35:52,579
Got him.

1020
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:05,008
Coming right up on his butt.

1021
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:32,952
- We're tracking suspect
vehicle heading west on l-17.

1022
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,167
- Air One to ground.
- I lost him.

1023
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:41,377
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1024
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:43,505
We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.

1025
01:36:43,672 --> 01:36:45,673
Stealth mode activated.

1026
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:47,550
Stay with me.

1027
01:36:53,724 --> 01:36:55,225
What --? There he is.

1028
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,371
Just hold on.

1029
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:21,543
Rachel!

1030
01:37:53,617 --> 01:37:55,785
They get any of this into the mains?

1031
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:56,953
Yeah.

1032
01:37:57,121 --> 01:37:59,956
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1033
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,792
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1034
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,462
- Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
- Why haven't we felt the effects?

1035
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,965
Must be a compound that
has to be absorbed through the lungs.

1036
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:20,894
How do you feel?

1037
01:38:23,647 --> 01:38:25,148
Where are we?

1038
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:29,444
- Why did you bring me here?
- lf I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1039
01:38:29,612 --> 01:38:31,654
- You were poisoned.
- lt was --

1040
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:35,450
- lt was Dr. Crane.
- Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1041
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:37,744
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1042
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:40,246
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1043
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:44,459
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1044
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:48,588
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1045
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:50,506
- What are they?
- The antidote.

1046
01:38:50,674 --> 01:38:54,010
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1047
01:38:54,386 --> 01:38:55,678
Mass production?

1048
01:38:55,846 --> 01:38:59,015
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1049
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:28,378
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1050
01:39:28,545 --> 01:39:31,464
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1051
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:34,133
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1052
01:39:34,301 --> 01:39:37,345
- lt's not.
- What would you call that?

1053
01:39:39,181 --> 01:39:41,891
- Damn good television.
- lt's a miracle no one was killed.

1054
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:45,728
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1055
01:39:45,896 --> 01:39:49,023
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1056
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:53,569
I'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.

1057
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:55,363
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1058
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:58,449
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1059
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:02,245
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1060
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:05,331
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

1061
01:40:05,582 --> 01:40:09,252
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

1062
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:12,422
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1063
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:14,507
- ls Fox still here?
- Yes, sir.

1064
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,300
We need to send these people away.

1065
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:19,429
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1066
01:40:19,596 --> 01:40:21,431
I don't care about my name.

1067
01:40:21,598 --> 01:40:24,767
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

1068
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:28,938
And it's all that's left of him.

1069
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:32,442
Don't destroy it.

1070
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,917
- Mr. Earle.
- Happy birthday, Bruce.

1071
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:51,502
Thank you.

1072
01:40:51,795 --> 01:40:53,796
How did the stock offering go?

1073
01:40:54,089 --> 01:40:55,298
Prices soared.

1074
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:56,716
Who was buying?

1075
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:58,801
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1076
01:40:58,969 --> 01:41:00,636
It's a bit technical.

1077
01:41:00,804 --> 01:41:02,555
The key thing is...

1078
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:04,724
...our company's future is secure.

1079
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:07,602
Great.

1080
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:23,618
A little the worse for wear, l'm afraid.

1081
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:31,125
What was the plan, Crane?

1082
01:41:31,293 --> 01:41:33,544
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1083
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:37,173
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1084
01:41:37,341 --> 01:41:39,175
Who were you working for, Crane?

1085
01:41:41,303 --> 01:41:43,513
Oh, it's too late.

1086
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:46,182
You can't stop it now.

1087
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:52,814
Here.

1088
01:41:52,981 --> 01:41:55,024
- Happy birthday, Bruce.
- Thank you. Thanks.

1089
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:58,069
And thank you for that item.

1090
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:00,822
You're welcome.

1091
01:42:00,989 --> 01:42:03,783
- I know you'll put it to good use.
- I already have.

1092
01:42:04,034 --> 01:42:07,870
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1093
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:09,539
Weeks. Why?

1094
01:42:09,706 --> 01:42:12,875
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1095
01:42:13,877 --> 01:42:16,963
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1096
01:42:17,881 --> 01:42:19,298
What?

1097
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:22,009
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1098
01:42:22,177 --> 01:42:25,054
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1099
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:28,724
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1100
01:42:29,184 --> 01:42:30,393
Misplaced?

1101
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:34,063
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1102
01:42:36,066 --> 01:42:39,569
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1103
01:42:39,736 --> 01:42:42,864
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1104
01:42:43,031 --> 01:42:45,074
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1105
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:47,243
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1106
01:42:47,703 --> 01:42:49,412
I suppose not.

1107
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:56,085
- Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
- Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1108
01:42:56,253 --> 01:42:59,172
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1109
01:42:59,339 --> 01:43:01,757
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1110
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:09,223
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1111
01:43:10,767 --> 01:43:12,059
I watched him die.

1112
01:43:12,227 --> 01:43:15,271
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1113
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:20,443
Are his methods supernatural?

1114
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:29,452
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1115
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:35,791
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1116
01:43:35,959 --> 01:43:37,960
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1117
01:43:38,795 --> 01:43:40,630
I saved your life.

1118
01:43:40,797 --> 01:43:43,299
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1119
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,679
Your quarrel is with me.

1120
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:52,058
You let these people go.

1121
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:55,603
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1122
01:43:57,814 --> 01:43:59,482
Everyone.

1123
01:44:00,275 --> 01:44:02,151
Everybody?

1124
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:06,614
I....

1125
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:11,327
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1126
01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:15,122
No, really.

1127
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:18,918
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1128
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:22,672
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1129
01:44:22,839 --> 01:44:26,509
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1130
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:29,303
- That's enough, Bruce.
- l'm not finished.

1131
01:44:29,638 --> 01:44:31,347
To all of you....

1132
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:35,851
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1133
01:44:36,019 --> 01:44:41,148
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1134
01:44:41,316 --> 01:44:44,860
...please, leave me in peace.

1135
01:44:45,028 --> 01:44:47,697
Please go.

1136
01:44:48,031 --> 01:44:51,450
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1137
01:44:51,618 --> 01:44:53,828
The party's over, get out.

1138
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:57,248
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1139
01:45:02,045 --> 01:45:04,380
He's turning into a jerk.

1140
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:12,388
Amusing.

1141
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:16,183
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1142
01:45:16,351 --> 01:45:19,854
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1143
01:45:20,022 --> 01:45:22,189
So Crane was working for you.

1144
01:45:22,357 --> 01:45:26,193
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1145
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:28,571
He was able to weaponize it.

1146
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:30,740
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1147
01:45:30,907 --> 01:45:35,411
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1148
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:40,708
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1149
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:44,920
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1150
01:45:57,559 --> 01:45:59,685
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1151
01:45:59,895 --> 01:46:03,356
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1152
01:46:03,523 --> 01:46:05,232
Crime. Despair.

1153
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,443
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1154
01:46:08,111 --> 01:46:11,280
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1155
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:12,948
...for thousands of years.

1156
01:46:13,116 --> 01:46:16,702
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1157
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:18,287
Burned London to the ground.

1158
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:21,290
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1159
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:23,417
...we return to restore the balance.

1160
01:46:23,585 --> 01:46:25,127
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1161
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:29,131
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1162
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:31,133
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1163
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:34,470
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

1164
01:46:45,607 --> 01:46:46,982
Time to play.

1165
01:46:51,154 --> 01:46:53,823
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1166
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:56,117
But I believed in you.

1167
01:46:56,284 --> 01:46:59,995
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1168
01:47:00,288 --> 01:47:02,498
You were my greatest student.

1169
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:06,001
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1170
01:47:06,795 --> 01:47:09,422
I'll be standing where I belong.

1171
01:47:10,006 --> 01:47:13,175
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1172
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:17,471
No one can save Gotham.

1173
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:25,479
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1174
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:31,360
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1175
01:47:31,903 --> 01:47:35,156
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1176
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:37,658
- You attacked Gotham before?
- Of course.

1177
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:40,536
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1178
01:47:40,704 --> 01:47:43,539
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1179
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:48,711
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1180
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:51,338
...such as your parents.

1181
01:47:55,385 --> 01:47:58,888
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1182
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:01,891
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1183
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:04,560
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1184
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:07,396
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

1185
01:48:07,564 --> 01:48:09,398
We are back to finish the job.

1186
01:48:10,066 --> 01:48:13,360
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1187
01:48:13,528 --> 01:48:17,072
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1188
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:20,242
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1189
01:48:20,452 --> 01:48:24,538
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1190
01:48:29,544 --> 01:48:31,712
- I am gonna stop you.
- You never did learn...

1191
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,923
...to mind your surroundings.

1192
01:48:36,092 --> 01:48:38,093
Justice is balance.

1193
01:48:38,261 --> 01:48:40,429
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1194
01:48:43,099 --> 01:48:45,267
Consider us even.

1195
01:49:01,618 --> 01:49:03,410
No one comes out. Make sure.

1196
01:49:13,296 --> 01:49:14,755
They're all gone?

1197
01:49:14,923 --> 01:49:17,633
- How many from maximum security?
- Every one of them.

1198
01:49:17,801 --> 01:49:19,635
Serial killers, rapists.

1199
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:22,638
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1200
01:49:22,806 --> 01:49:24,473
Yeah, l'll raise the bridges...

1201
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:28,727
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1202
01:49:28,895 --> 01:49:31,772
...that are running loose out there.
- Come on!

1203
01:49:54,963 --> 01:49:57,673
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1204
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,848
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1205
01:50:10,353 --> 01:50:14,690
What is the point of all those push-ups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1206
01:50:53,188 --> 01:50:55,230
What have I done, Alfred?

1207
01:50:56,232 --> 01:50:58,233
Everything my family...

1208
01:50:58,401 --> 01:51:00,319
...my father, built....

1209
01:51:02,697 --> 01:51:06,575
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1210
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:09,036
I wanted to save Gotham.

1211
01:51:09,871 --> 01:51:11,747
I failed.

1212
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:14,249
Why do we fall, sir?

1213
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:20,923
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1214
01:51:23,385 --> 01:51:25,552
You still haven't given up on me?

1215
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:28,931
Never.

1216
01:51:29,933 --> 01:51:31,266
Down!

1217
01:51:31,434 --> 01:51:34,395
Harassment! I see harassment!

1218
01:51:34,562 --> 01:51:36,605
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1219
01:51:36,773 --> 01:51:38,732
Madman with a gun.

1220
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,443
With residents furious...

1221
01:51:41,653 --> 01:51:44,780
...at the unprecedented show of police
strength to round up the inmates....

1222
01:51:44,948 --> 01:51:46,782
We're about to raise these bridges.

1223
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:50,619
Officer, I am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

1224
01:51:57,961 --> 01:52:00,295
- Just shut up!
- Hey, Flass, cool it!

1225
01:52:00,463 --> 01:52:01,964
Hold these people back.

1226
01:52:02,132 --> 01:52:04,925
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

1227
01:52:05,093 --> 01:52:07,469
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend sent me with this.

1228
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:09,138
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1229
01:52:09,305 --> 01:52:10,806
Hopefully you won't need it.

1230
01:52:10,974 --> 01:52:14,143
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1231
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:17,730
All right, last one across.

1232
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:22,317
People, they want this
bridge up in no more than three minutes!

1233
01:52:22,485 --> 01:52:25,904
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1234
01:52:26,489 --> 01:52:27,531
Go!

1235
01:52:54,350 --> 01:52:56,185
I can't find my mom.

1236
01:52:56,519 --> 01:52:58,020
Hey!

1237
01:53:06,362 --> 01:53:08,155
What the hell are you doing?

1238
01:53:09,657 --> 01:53:11,241
Gentlemen...

1239
01:53:11,659 --> 01:53:14,203
...time to spread the word.

1240
01:53:15,872 --> 01:53:17,331
And the word is...

1241
01:53:18,541 --> 01:53:20,334


...panic.

1242
01:53:44,317 --> 01:53:45,859
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1243
01:53:47,237 --> 01:53:48,362
Right there.

1244
01:53:48,655 --> 01:53:50,906
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1245
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:09,424
It's okay.

1246
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:43,792
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1247
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:45,627
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1248
01:54:45,837 --> 01:54:47,296
Come on!

1249
01:55:06,983 --> 01:55:08,984
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1250
01:55:09,319 --> 01:55:10,652
What the hell is going on?

1251
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:14,281
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1252
01:55:14,449 --> 01:55:18,660
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1253
01:55:18,828 --> 01:55:21,496
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1254
01:55:21,664 --> 01:55:25,167
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1255
01:55:26,002 --> 01:55:27,669
Of course they are!

1256
01:55:27,837 --> 01:55:30,839
- Crane?
- No. Scarecrow.

1257
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:34,009
Gordon...

1258
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:36,428
...there's nobody left to send in.

1259
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:39,640
So l'm on my own?

1260
01:55:43,728 --> 01:55:45,395
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1261
01:55:45,563 --> 01:55:48,148
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...

1262
01:55:48,316 --> 01:55:51,068
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1263
01:55:51,235 --> 01:55:53,153
- How are they gonna do that?
- The train.

1264
01:55:53,321 --> 01:55:57,157
The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1265
01:55:57,325 --> 01:55:59,034
If the machine gets to the station...

1266
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:02,704
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1267
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:04,456
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1268
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:07,834
I'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but I may need your help.

1269
01:56:08,002 --> 01:56:09,795
- What do you need?
- Can you drive stick?

1270
01:56:16,052 --> 01:56:17,719
There you are!

1271
01:56:17,887 --> 01:56:19,888
There is nothing to fear...

1272
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:21,807
...but fear itself!

1273
01:56:22,850 --> 01:56:24,601
I am here to help you!

1274
01:56:56,426 --> 01:56:58,593
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1275
01:57:03,766 --> 01:57:05,726
- He'll come.
- Don't peek.

1276
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:17,738
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1277
01:57:23,619 --> 01:57:25,746
I told you he'd come.

1278
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:32,377
Wait.

1279
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:34,963
You could die.

1280
01:57:35,131 --> 01:57:36,423
At least tell me your name.

1281
01:57:41,804 --> 01:57:44,014
It's not who I am underneath...

1282
01:57:44,974 --> 01:57:49,394
...but what I do that defines me.

1283
01:57:49,645 --> 01:57:50,979
Bruce?

1284
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:28,016
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1285
01:58:28,184 --> 01:58:30,685
- lt ends here.
- For you and the police, maybe.

1286
01:58:30,853 --> 01:58:33,188
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1287
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:36,691
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1288
01:58:36,859 --> 01:58:40,570
- I can't beat two of your pawns?
- As you wish.

1289
01:58:53,376 --> 01:58:55,710
GPS online.

1290
01:59:02,552 --> 01:59:04,719
In 100 yards.

1291
01:59:35,626 --> 01:59:36,918
Gentlemen.

1292
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:06,573
Who the hell authorized this?

1293
02:00:17,126 --> 02:00:19,211
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1294
02:00:26,469 --> 02:00:29,095
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1295
02:00:29,263 --> 02:00:30,639
If that pressure reaches us...

1296
02:00:30,806 --> 02:00:33,808
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1297
02:00:44,278 --> 02:00:47,155
At the next intersection, turn right.

1298
02:01:11,847 --> 02:01:13,306
You will never learn.

1299
02:01:20,856 --> 02:01:21,856
Sorry.

1300
02:01:25,861 --> 02:01:28,863
- Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
- How about this?!

1301
02:01:45,631 --> 02:01:47,882
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1302
02:02:01,230 --> 02:02:02,480
Evacuate the building.

1303
02:02:02,690 --> 02:02:05,191
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1304
02:02:14,076 --> 02:02:16,286
Weapons system activated.

1305
02:02:20,374 --> 02:02:21,416
Nice ride.

1306
02:02:36,599 --> 02:02:37,682
Armed.

1307
02:02:49,612 --> 02:02:51,071
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1308
02:02:53,866 --> 02:02:55,241
Come on. Come on.

1309
02:02:59,955 --> 02:03:02,082
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1310
02:03:02,249 --> 02:03:06,127
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1311
02:03:06,295 --> 02:03:08,880
Who said anything about stopping it?

1312
02:03:14,637 --> 02:03:16,221
Yes!

1313
02:03:24,397 --> 02:03:27,816
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1314
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:38,159
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1315
02:03:38,452 --> 02:03:40,745
I won't kill you...

1316
02:03:45,167 --> 02:03:47,335
...but I don't have to save you.

1317
02:05:02,495 --> 02:05:05,580
- The meeting's already started.
- What meeting?

1318
02:05:09,835 --> 02:05:12,754
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1319
02:05:13,255 --> 02:05:14,839
You did.

1320
02:05:15,007 --> 02:05:17,091
I got another job.

1321
02:05:17,927 --> 02:05:19,385
Yours.

1322
02:05:19,845 --> 02:05:21,554
On whose authority?

1323
02:05:22,056 --> 02:05:24,098
Batman may
have made the front page...

1324
02:05:24,266 --> 02:05:27,227
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1325
02:05:34,026 --> 02:05:35,068
Bruce Wayne.

1326
02:05:35,236 --> 02:05:39,030
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1327
02:05:39,198 --> 02:05:42,075
- The fact that l'm the owner.
- What are you talking about?

1328
02:05:42,243 --> 02:05:44,118
The company went public a week ago.

1329
02:05:44,286 --> 02:05:45,745
And I bought most of the shares.

1330
02:05:46,121 --> 02:05:49,582
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

1331
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:52,961
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1332
02:05:53,128 --> 02:05:56,464
...is that my company's future
is secure.

1333
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:58,258
Right, Mr. Fox?

1334
02:05:58,425 --> 02:06:00,260
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1335
02:06:02,471 --> 02:06:04,055
Didn't you get the memo?

1336
02:06:22,992 --> 02:06:26,160
- l'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
- No. No, Bruce...

1337
02:06:26,328 --> 02:06:27,745
...l'm sorry.

1338
02:06:28,622 --> 02:06:31,291
The day that Chill died, l....

1339
02:06:33,168 --> 02:06:34,794
I said terrible things.

1340
02:06:35,296 --> 02:06:37,046
But true things.

1341
02:06:37,673 --> 02:06:39,507
I was a coward with a gun...

1342
02:06:39,675 --> 02:06:43,469
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1343
02:06:44,513 --> 02:06:47,181
I never stopped thinking about you.

1344
02:06:48,684 --> 02:06:50,310
About us.

1345
02:06:50,936 --> 02:06:52,854
And when I heard you were back, l....

1346
02:06:53,689 --> 02:06:55,940
I started to hope.

1347
02:07:20,007 --> 02:07:22,717
But then I found out about your mask.

1348
02:07:23,886 --> 02:07:26,721
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1349
02:07:27,348 --> 02:07:29,015
No. This...

1350
02:07:30,184 --> 02:07:31,893
...is your mask.

1351
02:07:33,854 --> 02:07:37,398
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1352
02:07:38,233 --> 02:07:40,234
The man I loved...

1353
02:07:40,903 --> 02:07:42,403
...the man who vanished...

1354
02:07:43,614 --> 02:07:45,740
...he never came back at all.

1355
02:07:50,245 --> 02:07:52,914
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1356
02:07:55,084 --> 02:07:58,753
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1357
02:07:59,838 --> 02:08:01,756
...l'll see him again.

1358
02:08:12,851 --> 02:08:15,770
- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

1359
02:08:18,607 --> 02:08:21,067
Your father would be very proud of you.

1360
02:08:21,276 --> 02:08:22,902
Just like me.

1361
02:08:49,888 --> 02:08:51,764
What will you do?

1362
02:08:53,142 --> 02:08:54,726
Rebuild it.

1363
02:08:55,602 --> 02:08:57,979
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1364
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:06,070
Just the way it was, sir?

1365
02:09:08,157 --> 02:09:09,407
Yeah, why?

1366
02:09:09,575 --> 02:09:12,410
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1367
02:09:12,578 --> 02:09:14,996
...improving the foundations.

1368
02:09:15,205 --> 02:09:18,166
- ln the southeast corner?
- Precisely, sir.

1369
02:09:33,849 --> 02:09:36,726
- Nice.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1370
02:09:37,686 --> 02:09:40,354
- Well, sergeant?
- lt's "lieutenant" now.

1371
02:09:40,731 --> 02:09:42,190
You really started something.

1372
02:09:42,357 --> 02:09:44,358
Bent cops running scared.

1373
02:09:44,526 --> 02:09:45,985
Hope on the streets.

1374
02:09:46,236 --> 02:09:49,864
- But?
- The Narrows is lost.

1375
02:09:50,365 --> 02:09:54,202
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1376
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:56,537
We will.

1377
02:09:56,747 --> 02:09:58,372
We can bring Gotham back.

1378
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:01,042
- What about escalation?
- Escalation?

1379
02:10:01,251 --> 02:10:05,546
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1380
02:10:05,756 --> 02:10:10,051
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1381
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:13,554
- And?
- And you're wearing a mask...

1382
02:10:13,972 --> 02:10:15,848
...and jumping off rooftops.

1383
02:10:17,267 --> 02:10:19,310
Now, take this guy.

1384
02:10:19,561 --> 02:10:21,562
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1385
02:10:21,772 --> 02:10:25,024
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1386
02:10:25,275 --> 02:10:27,235
Leaves a calling card.

1387
02:10:33,075 --> 02:10:34,909
I'll look into it.

1388
02:10:38,413 --> 02:10:39,872
I never said thank you.

1389
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:47,046
And you'll never have to.
