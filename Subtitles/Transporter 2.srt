2
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:48,780
I'm so sorry.
Can you help me? My tyre...

3
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:52,326
Sorry. I have an appointment.
I don't like to be late.

4
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,245
Well, would you rather be late or dead?

5
00:01:56,955 --> 00:02:01,084
- You don't want to do this.
- Step out of the car.

6
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:10,051
Whoo! Let's go, fellas!

7
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:13,221
Come on, baby! Yes!

8
00:02:13,304 --> 00:02:15,806
Take it easy. The car's brand-new.

9
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,187
- No problem, buddy. I got this.
- Baby, let's ride. Time to go.

10
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,775
- Your parents know the company you keep?
- Shut up.

11
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:27,985
- This shit ain't working.
- It's coded.

12
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:30,112
- What's the code?
- I can't give you that.

13
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:33,616
We'll have to beat it out of you.
Get out the car.

14
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:36,827
Come on, man. What you got for me?

15
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:39,872
Kick your ass!

16
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:42,416
Hold on.

17
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,003
It just came out of the dry cleaner's.

18
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:09,860
Hands up.
Stop moving or I will shoot you.

19
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:12,737
Don't you have homework to do?

20
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:18,201
- Why don't you go and do it?
- OK. I'm sorry.

21
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:24,499
Late.

22
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,652
Hey! Hey!

23
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:41,241
- The game, the game, the game!
- What's the first rule on entering a man's car?

24
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:45,245
- Respect a man's car, a man respects you.
- Rule number two.

25
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:49,707
- Greet the man. Good afternoon, Frank.
- Good afternoon, Jack.

26
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,586
- Can we play the game?
- I should think you'd be tired after school.

27
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,549
- You're afraid I'm gonna win.
- You'll be too worn out to do your homework.

28
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:01,761
- It's Friday. I don't have any homework.
- In that case, the game.

29
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:06,516
- Yes!
- But first, what's the third rule of the car?

30
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,059
Good.

31
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:29,246
Five points. I'm white,
I'm round, but I'm not always around.

32
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,374
- A tennis ball?
- Tennis balls are yellow.

33
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,431
Four points.

34
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,476
Sometimes I'm half, sometimes whole.
Sometimes a slice is all you know.

35
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,937
- A loaf of bread?
- No.

36
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:03,280
Three points. Sometimes I'm light,
sometimes dark. Sometimes I'm both.

37
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,365
- I know. A light bulb.
- No.

38
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,825
- A pizza!
- No.

39
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:12,389
Audrey. Audrey! Stop walking away from me.

40
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:15,767
Listen, we've got to finish this conversation.

41
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,188
Where's he going?

42
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,194
OK, look at me. Last clue for all the points.

43
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:30,907
Everyone wants to walk on me,
but only a happy few ever have.

44
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:33,118
Take your time.

45
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,545
- Hey, bud.
- Shh! Mom, it's the game. I'm trying to think.

46
00:07:44,628 --> 00:07:48,424
- Sorry. Hey, Frank. How are you today?
- Well, Mrs Billings.

47
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:52,094
- Can I team up with Mom?
- I don't know. It's not in the rules.

48
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:55,848
Come on. What's the point in having rules
if you can't bend'em?

49
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:59,018
- OK. Just this once.
- Yeah!

50
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:01,896
All right. Give me some clues.

51
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:07,610
It's round, but not always around. It's light
sometimes, dark sometimes, or both.

52
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:12,406
Everyone wants to walk on it,
but only a happy few ever have.

53
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:16,160
- That is a hard one.
- Tell me about it.

54
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:21,999
- The moon!
- Correct.

55
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:24,376
Good job. All right. Come on.

56
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,962
- See you Monday.
- Bye, Frank. Thanks.

57
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:29,589
- Keep your snacks in the kitchen.
- Bye, Mom.

58
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:32,800
He's really taken to you
in the month you've been with us.

59
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:36,971
- Likewise.
- Too bad you can't stay on when Tony's back.

60
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:40,433
It was just a favour.
I don't usually do this sort of ajob.

61
00:08:40,517 --> 00:08:43,728
I thought you were a professional driver.

62
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:45,939
A different kind of driving.

63
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:52,362
Well, we're all gonna miss you
when you're gone.

64
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:00,453
And...

65
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:03,248
thank you for what you did.

66
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:05,583
For what?

67
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:10,046
For turning the car around so that
Jack wouldn't have to see us fighting.

68
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:14,050
- You really know kids, don't you?
- I know fighting.

69
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:16,760
He hasn't seen Jack in months,

70
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:20,138
and when he gets back,
all I hear is what I'm doing wrong.

71
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:25,936
You'd think that after being separated
for a year that he would...

72
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:30,899
I'm sorry. You don't have to hear this.

73
00:09:30,983 --> 00:09:36,905
It's OK. For what it's won'th,
I think you're doing a great job with Jack.

74
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:38,365
Thank you.

75
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:41,451
Any time I can be of help,
if there's anything you need.

76
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:44,580
That's really sweet of you, Frank.

77
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:47,457
I might have to take you up on it.

78
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:55,757
I almost forgot. I'm supposed to take Jack to
the doctor tomorrow morning for a checkup,

79
00:09:55,841 --> 00:10:00,679
but I'm organising a party for him, even
though his birthday's not until next week.

80
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:09,187
So, while I decorate and his friends arrive,
I was thinking, if you wouldn't mind...

81
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,523
- I'll take him.
- I feel funny cutting into your weekend.

82
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,860
I'm just picking up a friend at the airport
later on in the day.

83
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:18,279
- That's nice.
- What is?

84
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:21,657
The guys on security
say you're a bit of a loner. Um...

85
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:26,579
- So it's just nice to hear you have a friend.
- He's not really a friend.

86
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:28,956
He's French.

87
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,876
I'll call you back.

88
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,213
Audrey. I'd like to finish our conversation.

89
00:10:40,343 --> 00:10:43,387
If anything comes up before then,
you have my cell.

90
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:47,683
- Nothing will come up, Mrs Billings.
- Audrey.

91
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:49,310
Audrey.

92
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:22,425
- Yeah, hello?
- Confirmed for tomorrow. 9am.

93
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,894
Tomorrow, 9am. Only change -
the driver'll be taking him, not the mother.

94
00:12:14,977 --> 00:12:16,312
Even better.

95
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:25,696
Vasily?

96
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:38,291
- Is it stable?
- Yes, it's stable.

97
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:40,710
And the antidote?

98
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,094
See you tomorrow.

99
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:05,443
The drug-enforcement ministers
of six Latin American countries

100
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:07,779
arrived in Miami for a summit meeting...

101
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:11,324
Yeah. Martin, Frank.
1156 Palmeadow.

102
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:16,495
I'm waiting for an express delivery.
That's what you told me 45 minutes ago.

103
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:20,582
I don't need anything else. Just the pizza.

104
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,377
- I'm not paying for that...
- Hi.

105
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,546
Hi.

106
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:31,343
So, it's one medium pie, no mozzarella,
extra olives and extra anchovies,

107
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:33,720
which amounts to $11.95.

108
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:36,515
- I hope you're hungry.
- You have no idea.

109
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:39,977
I apologise for the delay, sir.

110
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,438
Mrs Billings.

111
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:48,569
Audrey. Audrey.

112
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:52,656
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

113
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:57,077
- Have you been drinking?
- A little.

114
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:01,956
You said if I needed anything.

115
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,210
- I can't.
- Why? Because of who I am?

116
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,881
Because of who I am.

117
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:23,519
I feel so lost. So confused.

118
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,064
Who isn't?

119
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:39,702
Thank you, Frank.

120
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:43,372
For the time and...

121
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:46,250
your respect.

122
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:49,336
I think it's what I needed the most.

123
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:53,340
Bye.

124
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,625
- Am I gonna get a shot?
- I don"t know.

125
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:56,110
- Jeez. We're not open yet.
- I need to see the doctor immediately.

126
00:15:56,193 --> 00:16:00,656
Right. Dr Koblin, if you'll come out here,
please. We have an issue.

127
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:03,242
You'll have to state the medical problem.

128
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:08,706
Actually, my problem's not medical.
It's psychological.

129
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:11,375
Yes, Laura. What seems to be the problem?

130
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,043
Me.

131
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:16,130
I hate shots.

132
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:20,176
Number one, there's no guarantee
you're getting a shot.

133
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:24,262
There's no sense getting worked up
over something that might not happen.

134
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:32,896
- Give me the news.
- Doctor said I'm cured.

135
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:37,817
- Frank, it hurts a lot.
- I'd never let anyone hurt you a lot.

136
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:40,862
- Promise?
- You know my fourth rule?

137
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:45,283
Never make a promise
you can't keep. Come on.

138
00:16:47,202 --> 00:16:49,496
Close the door.

139
00:16:57,921 --> 00:16:59,339
Come on.

140
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:08,765
- May I help you?
- Jack Billings to see Dr Koblin.

141
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:11,725
He's out sick today. He'll be seeing Dr Tyberg.

142
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:15,979
- I like Dr Koblin.
- Don't worry. Dr Tyberg's very nice.

143
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:18,273
Just take him into room 3.

144
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:20,192
- Where's Laura?
- Who?

145
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:24,029
- You're standing at her desk.
- That Laura. She's out sick too.

146
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:28,200
There's a lot of flu going around.
Now, come on. Doctor's got a busy day.

147
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:31,537
Come on. It'll be over before you know it.

148
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:35,040
Hey, hey!

149
00:17:35,749 --> 00:17:38,335
I'm Dr Tyberg.

150
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:40,546
Can't I wait for my doctor?

151
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:43,882
Your doctor was called away
on an emergency.

152
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:47,094
- The nurse said he had the flu.
- That was the emergency.

153
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:53,725
He came down with flu, very quickly.
So, the sooner we start, the sooner we finish.

154
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,312
Come. I show you something very cool.

155
00:17:57,396 --> 00:18:00,940
I'm sorry. Doctor-patient privacy in room.

156
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:04,360
You can wait in reception area,
or glass of water, or...

157
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:08,781
Hey, trust me. I am doctor.

158
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:11,075
Please. It's phone.

159
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:18,166
- Yeah?
- Allô, allô. Frank? I am here.

160
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:21,169
- You're early.
- Yeah, we had fantastic tailwinds.

161
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:23,963
Put two hours on my vacation, just like that.

162
00:18:24,046 --> 00:18:27,967
From now on, it's the only way I'm flying.
Tailwinds or nothing.

163
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,970
Glad you made it.

164
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:37,643
Hello. Sorry, Dr Dunietz is not in today.
Call back Monday.

165
00:18:43,316 --> 00:18:47,235
I'm a little tied up. You mind taking a cab?
You have the address, yes?

166
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:53,366
Oh, thank you. I heard the fish down here
is fantastic. I could make us a bouillabaisse.

167
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,244
You like bouillabaisse, Frank, no?

168
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,539
I gotta go.

169
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:00,790
Frank!

170
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,668
Maybe we'll wait for his regular doctor.

171
00:19:03,752 --> 00:19:06,379
It's important that he receives immunisations.

172
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:10,383
- I'm sure. But a week won't make a difference.
- No, we're doing it now.

173
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:34,573
Get going, Jack!

174
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:48,104
Look at me. Look at me.

175
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:51,357
- Remember my promise?
- Yes.

176
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,171
- It's... It's me!
- Get out!

177
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:20,636
Frank.

178
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:51,416
Shit.

179
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:04,887
The patient's not cooperating.
Prep the vehicle.

180
00:22:18,234 --> 00:22:20,862
Come on, hurry.

181
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:27,285
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be OK.

182
00:22:54,811 --> 00:22:58,857
- Freeze! Put your guns on the ground!
- Get down!

183
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:02,486
<i>- Sí.
- They got away.</i>

184
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:04,404
<i>- Cazzo!
- Plan B?</i>

185
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:07,741
Yes. Plan B.

186
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,387
Oh, you made it.

187
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:32,348
- Oh, what's that?
- Jack's birthday present.

188
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:35,893
Baseball uniform, cleats, glove and a bat.

189
00:23:38,103 --> 00:23:42,149
- It's his favourite sport.
- It was. Last year.

190
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:45,236
He's on a soccer team now. He's good.

191
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:48,906
- You know, you should see him sometime.
- Hello.

192
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:53,452
- Mr and Mrs Billings! They're coming!
- Hide, everyone. Hide!

193
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:03,128
- Yes.
- Good morning, Mr Driver.

194
00:24:03,212 --> 00:24:07,049
- Who is this?
- Look in your rear-view mirror and you'll see.

195
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:11,053
I know what you're thinking.
Bulletproof glass.

196
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:16,559
So tell me, in your experience - which judging
from the performance you put on in the office

197
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:19,185
goes way beyond driving children to school -

198
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:23,398
does bulletproof glass stop
a 7.62 armour-piercing round?

199
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:27,026
Frank, why have you stopped the car?

200
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:32,699
Don't look,
they are triangulated over 300 feet away.

201
00:24:32,782 --> 00:24:34,159
Frank, pick up.

202
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:39,706
You screwed up my plan.
I am going to tell you how to set things right.

203
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:43,543
Someone is going to appear in a few seconds.

204
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:57,182
Let her in.

205
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:06,940
Driver.

206
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:10,486
Good boy. Good boy.

207
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:15,991
Hi.

208
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:18,994
Leave it on.

209
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:25,959
Personally, I hate kids. I don't know
what your feelings are on the subject,

210
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:31,673
but if you ever want to have any, make
no moves but the moves I tell you to make.

211
00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:36,678
You're in her hands now. They can be gentle
hands, but they can be the hands from hell.

212
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:40,349
- Trust me on this one.
- Trust him on this one.

213
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:42,434
Now, drive.

214
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:26,519
Make a left.

215
00:26:26,602 --> 00:26:28,354
I said left.

216
00:26:49,457 --> 00:26:53,670
Listen, we keep doing this your way,
they're gonna catch us.

217
00:26:53,753 --> 00:26:56,673
- Do this my way, no one gets hurt.
- Where's the fun in that?

218
00:26:56,756 --> 00:26:59,468
Let's save the fun for later.

219
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,393
Hey!

220
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,037
Not bad.

221
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:55,832
Didn't your mother
teach you to say thank you?

222
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:58,084
She tried, and failed miserably.

223
00:28:58,168 --> 00:29:02,130
- I think we lost them.
- Think again.

224
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,178
Thought complete. Let's go.

225
00:29:38,832 --> 00:29:44,129
You can't find him? He's one man in one car.
He's a chauffeur, for chrissakes.

226
00:29:44,213 --> 00:29:47,549
Not exactly, sir.
There's a possibility he was in on it.

227
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:50,552
- That's impossible.
- How would you know?

228
00:29:50,636 --> 00:29:55,014
He could have been setting this up the
whole time, and you wouldn't have known.

229
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:59,310
- And you are an expert on knowing people.
- His background.

230
00:30:00,394 --> 00:30:04,982
He's ex-Special Forces. Headed a commando
unit. Specialised in search and destroy.

231
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:09,028
Been in and out of Lebanon, Syria, Sudan.
The man is a hunter.

232
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,823
I don't care what his skills are
or where he's from.

233
00:30:11,906 --> 00:30:15,034
This is not a war zone,
this is an American city!

234
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:17,411
Where's my son?

235
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,983
Last stop. All out.

236
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:54,823
You're quite a guy.
Another time, another place -

237
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:58,869
you and me, baby,
the pleasure we could have.

238
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,668
Beauty.

239
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:10,088
Frank.

240
00:31:11,131 --> 00:31:12,174
Frank!

241
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:15,594
Frank!

242
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:20,974
Not what you expected when you reported
for work this morning, is it, Frank? No?

243
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:24,227
Is that what passes for wit in this circle?

244
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:28,189
In this circle, my friend,
wit is not a requirement of the job.

245
00:31:28,272 --> 00:31:32,193
Brutality, yes.
An ability to inflict pain, absolutely.

246
00:31:32,276 --> 00:31:38,115
A certain psychotic, moral ignorance,
blind obedience, all required.

247
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:40,743
- But not wit. How was it?
- Fun.

248
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:43,829
Only the beginning, my love.

249
00:31:44,914 --> 00:31:48,042
- What's this all about?
- A timely question.

250
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,211
Max.

251
00:31:50,294 --> 00:31:52,630
Pardon me.

252
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:04,517
- Hello.
- Put me on the speaker.

253
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,646
In the next two hours,
you'll get five million dollars in $100 bills.

254
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:12,691
Put them in a waterproof suitcase,
go to the Bayfront Park - personally.

255
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:17,320
There will be a blue Chrysler parked there.
Place the suitcase in the trunk, and leave.

256
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:20,532
I don't know if I can get
five million dollars in two hours.

257
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:24,661
I read the newspapers. When you were
appointed to your current position,

258
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:28,915
your net won'th exceeded 100 million dollars,
so you won't even feel the bite.

259
00:32:28,998 --> 00:32:32,502
What guarantee do I have
that you won't harm my son?

260
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:36,714
"Guarantee"? Mr Billings,
I am not a car dealer.

261
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,844
Don't let the charming accent
and my impeccable syntax mislead you.

262
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:44,722
I live in the jungle, and in the jungle
you either eat or be eaten.

263
00:32:44,806 --> 00:32:47,851
But, in the spirit of business,
here is the guarantee.

264
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:51,729
Ten minutes past the deadline,
if the money doesn't arrive, I send a finger.

265
00:32:51,813 --> 00:32:55,692
20 minutes, a hand. 30 minutes, a foot.

266
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:58,486
Sounds like we have a deal.

267
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,072
You have a deal.

268
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,950
Could we please speak to our son?

269
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:08,537
Mommy! Mommy!

270
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,917
You have two hours, Mr Billings.
Starting now.

271
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:19,506
- Just get my son!
- All right. All right.

272
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,343
Frank, you promised
you wouldn't let anybody hurt me!

273
00:33:23,427 --> 00:33:27,806
- You promised!
- Never make promises you can't keep.

274
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,310
I don't. It's one of my rules.

275
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:32,853
Wow.

276
00:33:32,936 --> 00:33:39,193
Bravo. A man who leads his life by rules.
In my world rules are meant to be broken.

277
00:33:39,276 --> 00:33:43,864
- Not mine.
- You're gonna have to make an exception.

278
00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:46,033
Go.

279
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:17,104
<i>Prego.</i>

280
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:30,076
- Go.
- Hey, driver!

281
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:38,708
No, no, wait, wait.
A little distance between us isn't a bad thing.

282
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:41,378
<i>Andíamo!</i>

283
00:34:49,636 --> 00:34:52,097
Now.

284
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:28,507
Hold on. The signal.

285
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:31,260
- Hello.
- It's me.

286
00:35:31,343 --> 00:35:34,555
- You son of a bitch.
- Look, I had nothing to do with this.

287
00:35:34,638 --> 00:35:38,309
- One scratch on his head...
- Let me speak to who"s in charge.

288
00:35:38,392 --> 00:35:42,271
- This is US Marshal Stappleton.
- Act fast. There are three boats.

289
00:35:42,354 --> 00:35:45,774
- Tell us where you are.
- Get a plane. They're heading north.

290
00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:48,944
- Tell me where you are.
- Just tell us where you are!

291
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:50,946
Hello, Frank?

292
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:53,699
Got it.

293
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:24,229
<i>- Allô.
- Tarconi, it's me. Get out of the house.</i>

294
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:28,650
- I was just putting the madeleines...
- Forget the madeleines, just get out.

295
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:31,277
- And go where?
- Anywhere. Go to the beach.

296
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:34,948
Oh, the beach. The famous Miami Beach.

297
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:39,160
Oh, my dream.
I would love to go to the beach.

298
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,207
Maybe not.

299
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:48,002
- Freeze! Who the fuck are you?
- I'm the cook.

300
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:53,508
Oh. This is a mistake. A terrible mistake.

301
00:36:55,593 --> 00:37:00,222
Why we can't all just get along, you know?

302
00:37:15,946 --> 00:37:20,200
- Hello.
- It's Frank. Pretend it's someone else.

303
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:24,371
Hi, Susan.

304
00:37:24,913 --> 00:37:27,082
No, I'm just here at home.

305
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:30,627
I didn't do it, Audrey.
She had a gun on Jack. I had no choice.

306
00:37:30,711 --> 00:37:35,382
Yeah, I saw that. What do you know?

307
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:38,385
- It's more than a kidnapping.
- They asked for a ransom.

308
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:44,725
The doctors, they were fake. They were trying
to give Jack a shot. When I interrupted them...

309
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:51,481
I promised Jack I wouldn't let anyone
hurt him. I'm not gonna break that promise.

310
00:37:51,564 --> 00:37:53,774
- Frank.
- I'll call you back.

311
00:37:56,861 --> 00:37:59,197
Audrey.

312
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,536
- Is everything all right?
- That's a pretty stupid question to ask, Jeff.

313
00:38:12,043 --> 00:38:16,047
All right. So tell me again, Inspector Tarconi,

314
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:21,886
why you didn't immediately
identify yourself as a police officer.

315
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:27,517
Oh, I was overwhelmed
by the effectiveness of your operation,

316
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,852
the sophistication of your equipment.

317
00:38:29,936 --> 00:38:35,732
You know, I work in a small office
in a small town. We only have small crimes.

318
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:39,736
- I was a little insecure.
- You and Frank Martin are friends, right?

319
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:45,951
A friend? Oh, I wouldn't say exactly a friend.
I know him, we have a relationship.

320
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:48,161
A long relationship?

321
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:50,997
- Not so long.
- They found you cooking in his house.

322
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:52,499
- I'm French!
- So?

323
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:57,754
We don't need to know someone a long time
in order to cook for them. It's an icebreaker.

324
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,843
Take, for example, this sandwich
and coffee you so graciously offer me.

325
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:06,304
Well, pardon me to think so,
but it's not very good.

326
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:09,182
I know, but what has that
got to do with anything?

327
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:10,433
Do you have a kitchen?

328
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:14,980
Stay back. Stay back.

329
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,483
Don't move. Smith!

330
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,652
Drop it.

331
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,221
Oh, Jesus. What happened?

332
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:17,641
We'll take care of it for you.

333
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:26,525
- Is this safe?
- Look over your shoulder.

334
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,236
We got you covered.

335
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:45,168
As my mother used to say,
a meal is only limited by your imagination.

336
00:41:45,293 --> 00:41:47,837
- Crème brûlée et croque monsieur.
- Cream brûlée?

337
00:41:47,962 --> 00:41:49,213
- Crème brûlée.
- Cock?

338
00:41:49,338 --> 00:41:52,049
- Croque monsieur.
- Croque monsieur.

339
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:55,511
<i>- Ouí?
- Where are you?</i>

340
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:58,973
- Cooking.
- Cooking. Can you talk?

341
00:41:59,056 --> 00:42:02,351
- Oh, speak of the devil. My mother.
- Mom.

342
00:42:02,477 --> 00:42:05,772
Please, do you mind?

343
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:07,356
Thank you.

344
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:09,525
<i>Ouí, Maman. Je suís très bíen arrívé.</i>

345
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,696
<i>Ouí, très très bíen, mercí. Ouí.
Ah, ouí, c'est une très joíe vílle.</i>

346
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:17,825
- May I ask who you're cooking for?
- For the US marshals.

347
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:23,498
Once they found my badge, they were very
polite. They gave me a coffee and a sandwich.

348
00:42:23,581 --> 00:42:26,375
You wouldn't believe
what passes for food here.

349
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:31,963
I am correcting the situation while they wait
for my chief to call and confirm everything.

350
00:42:32,088 --> 00:42:36,927
Of course, that might take a while.
He's never there.

351
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,430
- Anything about me?
- They are very interested about you.

352
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:44,518
They want to know where you are.
Where are you?

353
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:47,813
Nowhere for very long. Listen, hold on.

354
00:42:51,691 --> 00:42:54,569
Do you have access to a computer?

355
00:42:54,694 --> 00:42:58,448
Easier than having access
to something decent to eat.

356
00:43:13,547 --> 00:43:18,301
- Oh, handsome fellow. Who is he?
- Do they have an ID program?

357
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:24,431
Forgive me. I'm not so used to this system.
At home, there is one computer for ten of us.

358
00:43:24,557 --> 00:43:26,892
So, how is it with you, Frank?

359
00:43:26,976 --> 00:43:30,563
- It's a complicated story.
- Ah, you mean you are in the shit?

360
00:43:30,646 --> 00:43:34,733
- You might say that.
- In other words, your natural state.

361
00:43:34,817 --> 00:43:36,360
Voilà.

362
00:43:36,444 --> 00:43:43,200
A Russian biologist with
advanced degrees from the state laboratory.

363
00:43:43,325 --> 00:43:49,081
- Do we have an address?
- Miami, Boca West, King Street, number 11.

364
00:45:32,474 --> 00:45:34,184
Get out!

365
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:02,003
Hey!

366
00:46:05,631 --> 00:46:09,469
- What are you doing?
- Trying to catch a bus.

367
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:13,514
Come on.

368
00:46:29,237 --> 00:46:33,909
What are you doing, driver?
Not so good on the water, hey?

369
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:38,705
Stop it! Stop it!

370
00:47:09,778 --> 00:47:12,614
- OK. OK.
- Tell me about the doctor's office.

371
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:16,242
- What doctor's office?
- Where you tried to stick the kid with this.

372
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:18,536
You want to tell me?

373
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:31,465
Do you know what you have done?
Do you know what you have done?

374
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:36,720
Obviously something not conducive to your
good health, which is all I needed to know.

375
00:47:36,804 --> 00:47:39,473
Have a good life...

376
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:41,892
what's left of it.

377
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:01,370
- Outpost to base. The ransom is still there.
- Thanks.

378
00:48:01,495 --> 00:48:03,414
The ransom hasn't been picked up.

379
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:06,916
- Don't worry.
- What if it's not just a kidnapping?

380
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,671
- I've worked on many kidnapping cases.
- If they don't take it I won't get my son back.

381
00:48:11,754 --> 00:48:14,799
Don't make this
any more complicated than it is.

382
00:48:14,924 --> 00:48:18,928
I'm not making this complicated, Jefferson.
It's because of yourjob.

383
00:48:19,012 --> 00:48:22,974
- What does my job have to do with this?
- It has everything to do with it.

384
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:26,519
Because you became famous,
we became the targets.

385
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:32,442
No matter what you think, the only one who's
out there trying to get Jack back is Frank.

386
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:35,153
- The chauffeur?
- You spoke to Frank Martin?

387
00:48:35,278 --> 00:48:40,950
- What the hell are you doing talking to him?
- He's the last person who saw Jack alive!

388
00:48:41,034 --> 00:48:42,994
We've found the boy.

389
00:49:09,144 --> 00:49:10,646
Hard drive blew.

390
00:49:10,729 --> 00:49:12,773
- Get another one in there.
- Yes, sir.

391
00:49:12,898 --> 00:49:16,527
- How long is it gonna take?
- Ma'am, we're going as fast as we can.

392
00:49:16,652 --> 00:49:19,113
- He can suffocate in there.
- Stay calm.

393
00:49:19,238 --> 00:49:21,323
- It's my son!
- Let them work.

394
00:49:21,406 --> 00:49:24,493
- Are you gonna sit and do nothing?
- They're experts.

395
00:49:24,576 --> 00:49:28,413
Everyone is an expert!
I've had it with all of you!

396
00:49:28,497 --> 00:49:29,957
Audrey!

397
00:49:33,418 --> 00:49:35,838
Audrey!

398
00:49:36,088 --> 00:49:37,714
Audrey!

399
00:49:42,343 --> 00:49:43,970
Audrey!

400
00:49:46,347 --> 00:49:48,766
Mommy!

401
00:49:51,185 --> 00:49:53,354
Jack!

402
00:49:54,021 --> 00:49:56,274
Are you OK?

403
00:50:01,195 --> 00:50:04,073
There you go, little buddy.

404
00:50:08,202 --> 00:50:11,414
Breathe. Come on, breathe.

405
00:50:11,539 --> 00:50:15,042
- You're the devil.
- I wish.

406
00:50:52,913 --> 00:50:57,751
- Shit! Dimitri, you scare shit in me.
- Where is Sonovitch?

407
00:50:57,834 --> 00:51:00,879
- In chamber.
- I need to speak with him.

408
00:51:01,004 --> 00:51:05,133
Sit down! Listen Panasonic.
Is rap music, is good.

409
00:52:45,273 --> 00:52:46,983
- What was that?
- I don't know.

410
00:52:48,193 --> 00:52:49,902
Shit!

411
00:52:50,027 --> 00:52:52,154
- What are you doing?
- I need antidote.

412
00:52:52,279 --> 00:52:55,365
The driver, he inject me with virus. Look!

413
00:52:55,449 --> 00:52:59,828
- Dimitri, where would he get the virus?
- The one we left in doctor's surgery.

414
00:52:59,953 --> 00:53:02,915
Please, I need antidote. I am sick.

415
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,169
Calm down. You're not sick. You have
four hours before the virus is active.

416
00:53:07,294 --> 00:53:09,630
You know that. You worked on creating it.

417
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:13,258
- Open fridge.
- I'm telling you...

418
00:53:14,802 --> 00:53:19,306
<i>/zvíníte. Open fridge. Open the fridge!</i>

419
00:53:19,973 --> 00:53:23,644
Yes. Insurance policy. How many you have?

420
00:53:23,727 --> 00:53:27,147
Two doses. Enough for Tipov and myself.

421
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:34,196
Tipov's policy cancelled. There is one for me.

422
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:36,572
And I want it now. Come on.

423
00:53:36,656 --> 00:53:39,617
Come on. Let's do it!

424
00:53:42,078 --> 00:53:43,579
- Let's not.
- Who are you?

425
00:53:43,663 --> 00:53:45,915
- There is enough for two.
- You don't need it.

426
00:53:45,998 --> 00:53:48,668
- But you injected me.
- With water.

427
00:53:48,751 --> 00:53:51,462
- I'm not sick.
- You're not sick.

428
00:53:51,587 --> 00:53:53,381
- Water.
- Water.

429
00:53:55,091 --> 00:53:56,384
Son of bitch!

430
00:53:59,762 --> 00:54:03,141
Good. Our problem is solved.
One dose for each of us.

431
00:54:03,266 --> 00:54:08,354
- It's not for us.
- One for you and one for the child. Touching.

432
00:54:08,438 --> 00:54:11,607
My patience is about to run out.

433
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:18,573
- Tell me about the virus.
- OK. What do you want know?

434
00:54:18,698 --> 00:54:20,324
Everything. What is it?

435
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:23,952
A recombinant retroimmune
double-polymorphing effluent.

436
00:54:24,035 --> 00:54:28,415
The child will die. Anyone he breathes on
will die, and then it's over.

437
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:33,128
- What do you mean, "It's over?"
- The virus goes inert after 24 hours.

438
00:54:33,211 --> 00:54:37,132
Thanks for the lesson.
Now give me the vials.

439
00:54:37,215 --> 00:54:43,013
You really want to play superhero, don't you?
Well, let's see if you can fly.

440
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,842
- You OK?
- I'm OK.

441
00:56:26,322 --> 00:56:31,703
There's nothing to worry about. It's just
a simple viral infection combined with stress.

442
00:56:31,828 --> 00:56:35,623
It should pass in a day or two.
I gave him something to help him sleep.

443
00:56:35,749 --> 00:56:40,170
- Call me if anything arises.
- Thank you, Doctor.

444
00:56:41,755 --> 00:56:45,592
You know, Audrey, all this has...

445
00:56:45,675 --> 00:56:49,636
well, it's made me realise
what a fool I've been.

446
00:56:49,762 --> 00:56:52,055
With Jack...

447
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:54,892
and with you.

448
00:56:57,352 --> 00:57:02,357
- Are you OK?
- Mr Billings. We're running late.

449
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:07,780
I'll be right out.
I'd like to come by after the conference,

450
00:57:07,863 --> 00:57:10,741
check on Jack.

451
00:57:10,866 --> 00:57:13,118
Check on you.

452
00:57:15,037 --> 00:57:18,624
Good. I'll see you soon.

453
00:57:18,707 --> 00:57:21,043
They're here if you need them.

454
00:57:33,055 --> 00:57:36,599
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- I'm fine.

455
00:57:39,977 --> 00:57:43,022
- Hello.
- It's me.

456
00:57:43,147 --> 00:57:45,024
- Are you OK?
- Go to your bedroom.

457
00:57:45,149 --> 00:57:48,319
Hi, Susan. How are you?

458
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:53,199
I'm alone. Where are you, Frank?

459
00:57:53,324 --> 00:57:55,576
Turn around.

460
00:58:06,003 --> 00:58:09,632
Frank, you were wrong.
It was a kidnapping. Jack is fine.

461
00:58:09,757 --> 00:58:15,179
Jack's been infected with a virus. Anyone
who comes into contact with him will die.

462
00:58:15,263 --> 00:58:17,807
What are you telling me?

463
00:58:17,932 --> 00:58:22,602
- Are you telling me my son is gonna die?
- No, he's not.

464
00:58:24,688 --> 00:58:29,109
Once incubated, the virus becomes airborne,
so anyone he breathes on gets infected.

465
00:58:29,192 --> 00:58:32,070
Your son was a weapon.
The target is his father.

466
00:58:32,195 --> 00:58:37,325
- Jefferson? Well, why?
- The conference. It's the only logical answer.

467
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:40,620
Every drug-enforcement agency in one room.

468
00:58:40,704 --> 00:58:43,832
Your husband breathes, the room dies.

469
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,549
You gotta trust me, Audrey.

470
00:58:59,556 --> 00:59:02,100
Can you get to him?

471
00:59:02,225 --> 00:59:05,228
- What are you gonna do?
- Find the guy responsible.

472
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:08,814
He has more of this.
For you and everybody else.

473
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:13,027
For you now.

474
00:59:29,502 --> 00:59:30,503
We have a guest.

475
00:59:32,338 --> 00:59:35,674
- You're burning up.
- I'm OK.

476
00:59:35,758 --> 00:59:38,177
You gotta go. Go.

477
00:59:41,597 --> 00:59:42,848
Don't move!

478
01:00:27,976 --> 01:00:30,270
- Is the governor here?
- Everybody's here.

479
01:00:30,395 --> 01:00:33,606
Delegates from all over the world.

480
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:37,277
- Just a second. Hello.
- Jefferson, you can't go to the conference.

481
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:40,905
- Is everything all right?
...to give him a deadly virus...

482
01:00:40,989 --> 01:00:44,158
- I can't hear you. I'm inside.
- I've got it, and so do you.

483
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:47,911
- I can't hear you.
- Their plan is to infect everyone there.

484
01:00:47,995 --> 01:00:50,914
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Jeff!

485
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:56,295
Mr Billings, are you all right?

486
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,798
- I'm all right. Come on, let's go.
- You sure?

487
01:01:20,194 --> 01:01:23,405
<i>- Allô.
- You still a guest of the government?</i>

488
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:28,702
They gave me the five-star accommodation.
Let me guess - you need my help.

489
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:31,287
Are you near the computer?

490
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:34,916
It's practically my pillow.
So, how do you want to start?

491
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:41,631
- I don't know. I have nothing.
- Ah. My favourite type of investigation.

492
01:01:41,714 --> 01:01:44,759
<i>Let's see. Alors.</i>

493
01:01:45,384 --> 01:01:48,721
I'd like to take this opportunity
to introduce you to...

494
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:53,518
Breathe. That's right,
breathe, my friend, breathe.

495
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:56,979
Once these bastards are out of the way

496
01:01:57,063 --> 01:02:02,193
and their agreements are dead and buried,
you know what the biggest problem will be?

497
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,238
- What?
- Counting the money.

498
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:12,537
- I can't wait.
- Ay-ay-ay!

499
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:20,127
Aah. Gianni Chellini.

500
01:02:20,252 --> 01:02:25,090
Hires himself out to anyone looking
to make trouble - Red Brigade, Shining Path.

501
01:02:27,259 --> 01:02:30,887
Someone accessed a database
on the 15th floor.

502
01:02:31,012 --> 01:02:35,100
That's Gonzalez. He's on vacation.

503
01:02:35,183 --> 01:02:40,147
Was behind the hostage-taking
of the OPEC ministers in Geneva.

504
01:02:40,272 --> 01:02:42,691
It was a nice piece of work.

505
01:02:47,112 --> 01:02:49,448
- Give me an address.
- Miami, East Highland,

506
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:51,867
Pelican Drive, number 26900.

507
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:54,995
- We've found the car.
- You're one great cop, Tarconi.

508
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,124
Thank you for the compliment.
Now I'm going back to sleep.

509
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:04,337
Hm. Maybe not.

510
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:09,884
- Bumbaclaat, man! Move out the way!
- Move over.

511
01:03:09,967 --> 01:03:12,178
I'll do ya!

512
01:03:20,144 --> 01:03:22,313
Mommy.

513
01:03:23,397 --> 01:03:27,985
- Honey. You feeling better?
- A little bit.

514
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:31,489
Why don't you try to go back to sleep, OK?

515
01:03:37,161 --> 01:03:39,622
Ma'am, are you all right?

516
01:03:49,757 --> 01:03:52,301
Jefferson. Jefferson, are you OK?

517
01:04:56,989 --> 01:04:59,241
OK, do it.

518
01:05:11,587 --> 01:05:15,841
- What are you doing?
- You know, last night got me thinking.

519
01:05:15,924 --> 01:05:18,510
How do we transport the antidote safely?

520
01:05:18,594 --> 01:05:22,181
We need something that won't break
or can't be stolen.

521
01:05:22,264 --> 01:05:26,351
Something totally secure. Me.

522
01:05:32,356 --> 01:05:35,610
Impressive. Get dressed.

523
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:38,321
Stop him.

524
01:05:41,532 --> 01:05:43,993
- These your friends?
- Not yet.

525
01:05:53,628 --> 01:05:56,380
- Where'd they go?
- The garage.

526
01:05:57,882 --> 01:05:59,759
- I'm out of ammo.
- Me too.

527
01:05:59,884 --> 01:06:02,011
- So am I.
- Where are the reloads?

528
01:06:02,136 --> 01:06:03,638
The garage.

529
01:06:04,972 --> 01:06:07,683
Check the house. Go, go, go!

530
01:06:11,562 --> 01:06:13,731
Get him! Get him!

531
01:07:49,492 --> 01:07:52,869
- What do you want me to do?
- Keep the meter running.

532
01:07:52,994 --> 01:07:58,249
Bye. Don't worry, baby.
You're safe now. You're safe.

533
01:07:58,333 --> 01:08:02,378
You're so beautiful.
Remind me of my yellow poom-poom rider.

534
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:20,789
Don't move.

535
01:09:20,914 --> 01:09:24,042
- Oh, Mr Driver.
- I'll blow you into tomorrow.

536
01:09:24,168 --> 01:09:28,171
I'll bleed what you came for
all over the floor. You wouldn't want this.

537
01:09:28,254 --> 01:09:32,049
Not after you worked so hard
trying to get to the antidote.

538
01:09:32,175 --> 01:09:34,719
Take a good look, Frank Martin.

539
01:09:34,844 --> 01:09:38,473
I'm a cure for what ails you.
I'm the only cure for what ails you.

540
01:09:38,598 --> 01:09:41,851
I am the antidote.

541
01:09:41,934 --> 01:09:45,271
Nice try. I'm impressed.
I didn't give you enough credit.

542
01:09:45,354 --> 01:09:49,484
- It took more than a driver to figure this out.
- I haven't figured it all out yet.

543
01:09:49,609 --> 01:09:53,112
Perhaps I can help you.
What part are you a little thick on?

544
01:09:53,196 --> 01:09:56,532
- You. Why?
- Oh.

545
01:09:56,616 --> 01:10:02,747
That's the easy part. It's a business deal, pure
and simple. I'm for hire to the highest bidder.

546
01:10:02,872 --> 01:10:06,417
In this case, the highest bidder
was the Colombian cocaine cartels

547
01:10:06,542 --> 01:10:09,921
that wanted these pesky lawmen
off their backs.

548
01:10:10,046 --> 01:10:13,466
You think killing politicians
will make things easier for them?

549
01:10:13,549 --> 01:10:17,094
That's not my problem.
I was hired to do ajob.

550
01:10:17,219 --> 01:10:21,848
I did the job, like you. Just my pay is better.

551
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:25,811
My hair and my suit, too.

552
01:10:27,396 --> 01:10:29,898
Oh, Lola.

553
01:10:29,981 --> 01:10:33,527
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a plane to catch.

554
01:10:34,486 --> 01:10:36,863
Kill him.

555
01:10:36,988 --> 01:10:38,698
<i>Cíao.</i>

556
01:10:42,661 --> 01:10:45,080
- Don't even blink.
- What's in this for you?

557
01:10:45,163 --> 01:10:47,249
Pleasure...

558
01:10:49,751 --> 01:10:52,712
in killing you.

559
01:12:28,598 --> 01:12:31,267
We're coming live
from the Key Biscayne causeway

560
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:35,480
where at least ten police cars are in
hot pursuit of a stolen red pick-up truck.

561
01:12:39,858 --> 01:12:43,153
Oh, my. This is just nuts.
Jim, are you getting that?

562
01:12:43,278 --> 01:12:48,075
There's another car that is swaying
past the police, as if they were standing still.

563
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,037
- Son of a bitch can drive. Whoo.
- Yes, he can.

564
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:40,626
We have clearance for takeoff.

565
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:45,840
Sit back, enjoy your flight, and
we will be in Colombia before you know it.

566
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:33,178
We have a problem with the landing gear.
I need to land.

567
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:35,764
- Can we fly with the problem?
- Theoretically.

568
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:39,684
Then you'll land when we get to Colombia.

569
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:42,479
Go and see if you can lift it manually.

570
01:14:42,562 --> 01:14:46,191
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Nothing to worry about.

571
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:53,740
Sorry, flight's been cancelled.

572
01:14:53,824 --> 01:14:57,494
I'm sorry to inform you
that you have been cancelled.

573
01:14:57,577 --> 01:15:00,704
Have a seat.

574
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,958
Relax.

575
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:07,169
Drink something.
Let's get to know each other.

576
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:10,756
I think I know everything I need to know.

577
01:16:56,735 --> 01:16:58,779
Shit.

578
01:18:38,126 --> 01:18:42,714
Five points. What has eyes
but no ears, skin but no hair,

579
01:18:42,798 --> 01:18:44,883
it's white inside and brown outside?

580
01:18:44,966 --> 01:18:46,885
- Mom?
- A worm?

581
01:18:46,968 --> 01:18:50,806
- Wrong. Dad?
- A caterpillar.

582
01:18:50,889 --> 01:18:53,767
- Wrong.
- A potato.

583
01:18:57,812 --> 01:19:01,023
- May I help you?
- I was just leaving.

584
01:19:04,443 --> 01:19:06,487
- Coconut.
- Wrong.

585
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:10,282
- A snake.
- Wrong.

586
01:19:10,408 --> 01:19:13,661
- A peanut.
- Yuck!

587
01:19:13,786 --> 01:19:16,038
- A hot dog.
- Wrong.

588
01:19:28,968 --> 01:19:31,220
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

589
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:37,935
- Didn't want you to miss your plane.
- That's very thoughtful of you.

590
01:19:45,775 --> 01:19:48,278
Check it out, my man.

591
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:54,451
You won't believe
what happened to me last night.

592
01:20:00,039 --> 01:20:03,543
I have something for you.
Since you never got to the beach.

593
01:20:03,626 --> 01:20:09,090
Oh, you know, water's water, sand is sand.
Here, there - it's all the same.

594
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,342
Flight 069 to Paris.

595
01:20:11,468 --> 01:20:14,512
Thank you, Frank.
It was an interesting vacation.

596
01:20:14,637 --> 01:20:17,932
- What more could one ask for?
- Ah, yeah.

597
01:20:18,892 --> 01:20:22,729
<i>- Au revoír, Frank.
- Au revoír, my friend. Have a good flight.</i>

598
01:20:22,812 --> 01:20:25,398
I doubt it. They said it is all headwinds.

599
01:20:25,482 --> 01:20:29,444
I guess we can't have
everything we wish for, can we?

600
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:32,488
No, we can't.

601
01:20:47,211 --> 01:20:48,504
Yeah.

602
01:20:48,587 --> 01:20:51,548
I'm looking for a transporter.

603
01:20:54,968 --> 01:20:56,720
I'm listening.
