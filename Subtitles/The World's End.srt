00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,265
<i>Ever had one of those nights</i>

3
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:36,976
<i>that starts out like any other, but ends
up being the best night of your life?</i>

4
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,816
<i>It was June the 22nd,
1990, our final day of school.</i>

5
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:52,088
<i>There was Oliver Chamberlain, Peter Page,
Steven Prince, Andy Knightley and me.</i>

6
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:56,968
<i>They called me The King.
Because my name's Gary King.</i>

7
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,961
<i>Ollie was funny, he fancied himself as a bit
of a player, but really, he was all mouth.</i>

8
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,429
<i>We called him O-Man</i>

9
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,265
<i>because he had a birthmark on his
forehead that looked like a six.</i>

10
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,246
<i>He loved it.</i>

11
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,636
<i>Pete was the baby of the group.</i>

12
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:14,084
<i>He wasn't the kind of kid we'd usually hang
out with, but he was good for a laugh.</i>

13
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,016
<i>And he was absolutely minted.</i>

14
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:22,815
<i>Steve was a pretty cool guy. We
jammed together, chased the girls.</i>

15
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,085
<i>I think he saw us as rivals.
Sweet, really.</i>

16
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,155
<i>And Andy.
Andy was my wingman.</i>

17
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,000
<i>The one guy I could rely
on to back me up.</i>

18
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,663
<i>He loved me, and I'm not being
funny, but I loved him, too.</i>

19
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,265
<i>There was nothing we were
gonna miss about school.</i>

20
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,336
<i>Maybe Mr. Shepherd.</i>

21
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,070
<i>He was definitely
one of the good guys.</i>

22
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,545
<i>He used to ask me what I
wanted to do with my life,</i>

23
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,598
<i>I told him I just wanted
to have a good time.</i>

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,709
<i>He thought that was funny.
It wasn't meant to be.</i>

25
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,053
<i>Not that night.</i>

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,057
<i>Newton Haven was our hometown.
Our playground, our universe.</i>

27
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,028
<i>And that night it was the
site of a heroic quest.</i>

28
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,100
<i>The aim? To conquer
The Golden Mile.</i>

29
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:07,329
<i>Twelve pubs along a legendary
path of alcoholic Indulgence.</i>

30
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,528
<i>There was The First Post,
The Old Familiar,</i>

31
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,032
<i>The Famous Cock, The Cross
Hands, The Good Companions,</i>

32
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,079
<i>The Trusty Servant, The Two Headed
Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive,</i>

33
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,836
<i>The King's Head,
The Hole in the Wall...</i>

34
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:21,081
<i>All before reaching our
destiny, The World's End.</i>

35
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,515
<i>We took my car into town.</i>

36
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,715
<i>I called it The Beast
because she was pretty hairy.</i>

37
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,881
<i>And so, our journey into manhood began.</i>

38
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,453
<i>We were off.
We didn't waste any time.</i>

39
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,757
<i>We hit pub one
and we hit it hard.</i>

40
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,327
<i>There was drinking, there was
fun, there was controversy,</i>

41
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,393
<i>there were ladies, there
were shots, there was drama,</i>

42
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:43,307
<i>and of course,
there was drinking.</i>

43
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,234
<i>By pub five,
we were feeling invincible</i>

44
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,802
<i>and decided to purchase
some herbal refreshment</i>

45
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,672
<i>from a man we called
The Reverend Green.</i>

46
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,916
<i>Pint six put O-Man out of commission,
so we carried on without him.</i>

47
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,711
<i>Good thing, I bumped into
his sister in the next pub,</i>

48
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,454
<i>we went into the disableds
and I bumped into her again.</i>

49
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,884
<i>Sam tagged along for a while,
but then I had to let her go.</i>

50
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:08,594
<i>I had another date that night
and her name was Amber.</i>

51
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,470
<i>Nine pints in and it was us
against the world.</i>

52
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,093
<i>Things got mental
in The Beehive,</i>

53
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,628
<i>so we repaired to
the bowls club</i>

54
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,874
<i>or as we liked to call it, The Smokehouse,
which is when it all went fuck up.</i>

55
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,303
<i>Everyone got para and Pete chucked
a whitey, so we had to bench him.</i>

56
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,376
<i>In the end, we blew off the last
three pubs and headed for the hills.</i>

57
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,011
<i>I remember sitting up there,</i>

58
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:35,147
<i>blood on my knuckles, beer down
my shirt, sick on my shoes,</i>

59
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,492
<i>seeing the orange glow
of a new dawn break</i>

60
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:41,497
<i>and knowing in my heart, life
would never feel this good again.</i>

61
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:43,956
<i>And you know what?</i>

62
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,799
It never did.

63
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:53,170
Thank you, Gary.
That was very enlightening.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,903
Would anyone like to add anything
or maybe challenge Gary?

65
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,672
Are you disappointed?

66
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:03,553
About what? That you didn't
make it to The World's End?

67
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,585
No.

68
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,051
<i>Just what is it
that you want to do?</i>

69
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,053
<i>We want to be free!</i>

70
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,123
<i>We want to be free to do
what we want to do!</i>

71
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,525
<i>And we want to get loaded. And
we want to have a good time,</i>

72
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,160
<i>And that's what
we're going to do.</i>

73
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,795
<i>We're going to have
a good time.</i>

74
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:23,917
<i>We're going to have a party.</i>

75
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,709
<i>Just what is it
that you want to do?</i>

76
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,051
<i>And we want to get loaded.
And we want to have a good time,</i>

77
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:52,718
She's a beauty.
Yeah, but she's no Beast.

78
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,553
Hello, Peter.

79
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,591
Jesus! Gary?

80
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,767
The once and future King.

81
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,268
Were you outside my
house this morning?

82
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,565
No.

83
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,295
I could have sworn
I saw you on my street.

84
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,231
I've never been
to Bishop's Gardens.

85
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,532
How you doing, man?

86
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,968
I'm well. You?
Yeah, never better.

87
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,505
How is, uh...
Vanessa?

88
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,071
No. Your wife?
Vanessa.

89
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,273
Yeah. How's she?
She's good.

90
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,642
Have you had sex yet?
We have two children.

91
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,511
Ooh, twice. Get you, fuck machine.

92
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,846
We haven't changed, have we?

93
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,114
What is he doing here?

94
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,149
It's all right, Dad.
We're fine.

95
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,595
Hi, Mr. P.

96
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,654
So, Gary, how can I help you?

97
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,464
He looks well. Are you
looking to buy a car?

98
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:34,798
Uh... No.
I'm afraid the end is nigh.

99
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,563
What?
The World's End.

100
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,664
What do you mean?

101
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:42,401
You know what I mean. One night.
Five guys. Twelve pubs.

102
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,710
Let battle commence.

103
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,037
You want to try that again?

104
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,672
Yeah, isn't that something
you've always wanted?

105
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,908
Not particularly. No.
Look. Peter.

106
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,112
We didn't make it before, but this time, we're
gonna see it through to the bitter end.

107
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,246
Or lager end.

108
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,915
We?
Yeah, the whole gang.

109
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,556
Even Andy? Why wouldn't
Andy be coming?

110
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,687
Well, I thought that after the accident...
Notan issue. He's in.

111
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,023
What we wanna know is are you?

112
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,765
I'd have to check with Vanessa.

113
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,693
Who's Vanessa?
My wife.

114
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,361
Since when have you had to
check with your wife?

115
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,396
Since we got married.

116
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,531
Oh, come on, man,
don't you miss it?

117
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:16,201
The laughs, the
camaraderie, the fights,

118
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,910
the hangovers so fierce it feels
like your head is full of ants.

119
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,109
Maybe the first two.

120
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,184
It begins.
What's your new number?

121
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,686
Same one I've had for 10 years.

122
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:24,945
Yeah. What's that one?

123
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:32,451
This entire row here, they'll all have
dormer windows above the front elevation.

124
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,453
Who's the helmet
without an helmet?

125
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,864
That's Gary King.

126
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,166
Knock, knock.

127
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,038
What are you doing here, Gary?

128
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,646
You're supposed to say,
"Who's there?"

129
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,748
I can see who's there.
It's you.

130
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,307
I like what you've done
with the place. Bit draughty.

131
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,948
How's Selina?
We divorced 10 years ago.

132
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,912
Yeah, I know, just
wondered how she was.

133
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,448
She's doing very well,
apparently.

134
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,849
Have you got anyone
else on the go?

135
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,423
Yeah, I do, as it happens. She's a
fitness instructor. Twenty-six.

136
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,228
Pedophile. I'm kidding.
I'd love to meet her sometime.

137
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,924
No. Why are you here?

138
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:15,532
Haven't you heard? We're getting
the band back together.

139
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,763
I'm not your
bass player anymore.

140
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,832
No, I mean we're getting
the boys back together.

141
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,437
We can get the band back
together as well if you want.

142
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,903
No, we can't. You sold
my guitar to buy drugs.

143
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,240
I've always wondered, what's
that thing over the door called?

144
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,242
That's a lintel.

145
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,444
So, the plan is, we're going
to go back to Newton Haven,

146
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,645
we are gonna do The Golden Mile

147
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,615
and this time, we are gonna
make it to The World's End.

148
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,950
Everybody's in.

149
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,151
What, even Andy?

150
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,753
Oh, you better
believe it, big balls.

151
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,522
Andy is going drinking with you?
With us.

152
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,027
Think about it, go back to the
old town, sink a few pints...

153
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,765
Twelve pints.
Yeah.

154
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,999
Twelve pints is insane.
I know!

155
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,135
What is this all about, Gary?

156
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,935
It's about closure, you know.

157
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,105
Why should getting older affect
something as important as friendship?

158
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,950
A let's changed since then, Oliver.
Right.

159
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,811
This is our chance
to take stock.

160
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,792
A stock take?
You make it sound so much fun.

161
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,115
Come on, O-Man. Isn't that
something you'd like?

162
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,584
What I'd really like is for you
to take your DMs off the sofa.

163
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,687
Look. If you're worried about
me, don't be. All right?

164
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,824
I'm here to tell you that Gary
King is back on the horse.

165
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,727
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're back on the horse?

166
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,763
No, I mean
I'm back on the bike.

167
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,063
What is bike?
What do you mean?

168
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,731
What is bike slang for?
Bicycle.

169
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,832
I'm lost.
Don't be.

170
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,067
Okay.
Listen.

171
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,708
This is our chance to finally
finish what we started.

172
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,477
Come on, man,
it'll be fucking mental!

173
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,475
I think we're all done.
So...

174
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,010
How do you like the property?

175
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,012
Yeah. It's amazing.
Amazing location.

176
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,747
Fantastic.
Fantastic aspects.

177
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,583
It's just... It's just a little
bit out of our price range.

178
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,518
He'll knock some off for you.
What's it down for?

179
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,487
1.2 million.
Fuck off!

180
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,158
You have my card.

181
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,360
Gary, WTF?

182
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,929
It's good to see you,
too, O-Man.

183
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,564
Please don't call me O-Man.
Sure.

184
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,466
Hey, how's your sister?
She's fine.

185
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,667
She talk about me?
No.

186
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,535
So, Friday, we'll all
go down together.

187
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,913
Make a road trip of it,
I'll drive.

188
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,518
Don't think I can. I think I've
got a doctor's appointment.

189
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,219
Yeah, you do.
With Dr. Ink!

190
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,350
You know, Dr. Ink?
Yeah. "Drink." I get it.

191
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,315
Come on. It wouldn't be the
same without the O-Man.

192
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,349
Jesus.

193
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,320
You can see the guys, see how they're doing.
Tell them how you're doing.

194
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,801
You never know, you might
make it to the end this time.

195
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,067
And Andy's definitely coming?
Yeah.

196
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,729
Andy Knightley?
Totes.

197
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,869
And you convinced him how?

198
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,073
Mr. Knightley.
Felicity.

199
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,912
You have a friend
hereto see you.

200
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,087
No, I don't.

201
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,653
This is a bit grown up, isn't it?
Yup.

202
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,086
Saw the boys the other day.
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:57,227
O-Man, Stevie-Baby,
the Petertron.

204
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,593
Yeah, I remember the names of
our childhood friends, Gary.

205
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,763
We had ourselves a little idea.

206
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,864
Did you now?

207
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,435
Yeah. We're going to go
back to Newton Haven.

208
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,742
Why? For some
unfinished business.

209
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,117
That's a joke, right?

210
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:19,077
Five guys. Twelve pubs. Fifty pints.
Sixty pints.

211
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,955
Steady on, you fucking alky.

212
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,315
I haven't had a drink
for 16 years, Gary.

213
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,284
You must be thirsty then.

214
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,587
We can go back, see the guys, chew the
fat, it'll be just like it always was,

215
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:31,523
except this time we're going to
finish this thing once and for all.

216
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,226
You have a very selective
memory, Gary. Thanks.

217
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,961
You remember the Friday nights.

218
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,162
I remember the Monday mornings.

219
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,234
Yeah, that's why we're
going back on a Friday.

220
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,205
Why do you think none of
us live in Newton Haven anymore?

221
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,904
I don't know. Because it's a black hole.
It's boring.

222
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,773
It always was
and it always will be.

223
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,118
It's only boring
because we're not there.

224
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,278
It's pointless arguing with you.
Exactly. So come.

225
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,015
I'm picking everybody up from High
Wycombe station, Friday, 3:00 sharp.

226
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,083
No, Gary.

227
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,485
Oh, God, why? Have you got
to check with your missus?

228
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,797
No, actually, I don't have
to check with my missus.

229
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,270
What are you doing?
I'm showing you the door.

230
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,562
Is it a door?
It doesn't have a lintel.

231
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,765
And it's glass. So is it a
window or is it a dour?

232
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,970
Maybe it's a windoor.
You can have that.

233
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,279
Please leave, Gary.

234
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,419
All right. All right.

235
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,858
£600, wasn't it?

236
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,793
Oh, urn, I thought you should know.
What?

237
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,157
Mum died.

238
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,195
When?
Couple of weeks ago.

239
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,306
The big cancer.

240
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,336
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,013
She just always really
liked you, you know.

242
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,504
Got me thinking
about the old days.

243
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,883
Particularly that night, you
know, because we were so happy.

244
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,678
And, you know, I love
the boys like brothers,

245
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,718
but when all's said and done,
you're the best friend I ever had.

246
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,692
It was good to see you, mate.

247
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,033
Pete?

248
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,868
Steven. Thank God.

249
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,803
I had a horrible feeling I was
going to be the only one here.

250
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,506
I reckon that's not the last horrible
feeling you're gonna have today, mate.

251
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:28,707
This can't be happening.
Can it?

252
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,642
You said it. What the
hell are we doing here?

253
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,144
What we always did.

254
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,880
Follow Gary King into
almost certain oblivion.

255
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,148
Hello, Steven.

256
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,349
You all right, mate?

257
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,795
Pete. Hi, mate.

258
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,254
Didn't we decide to stop calling him
Fearless Leader somewhere around 1992?

259
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,522
Old habits die hard.

260
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,090
They'll be putting that
on Gary's tombstone.

261
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,825
No, they won't.
You know he'll outlive us all.

262
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,560
That's! be funny
if it wasn't true.

263
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,529
Hang on a sec.
What?

264
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,732
I'm just trying to decide which of
us is the biggest idiot for coming.

265
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,442
Maybe he had an accident.
Oh, sorry, Andy.

266
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,844
Sorry. No, no, no. It's fine.

267
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,112
I think Gary having an accident

268
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,787
would actually be the best outcome
for all of us, including Gary.

269
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,597
Unbelievable.

270
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,495
Oh, yes.

271
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,594
Look at these cunts.

272
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,129
You're late.
No, I'm not.

273
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,633
Yeah, you are. You said 3:00.
It's almost 4:00.

274
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,200
Yeah, 3 for 4.

275
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,135
You know your problem, Gary?
You're never wrong.

276
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,236
How is that a problem?

277
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,171
I can't believe you bought
another Granada Mark II.

278
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,239
What do you mean?

279
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,875
This looks exactly like
the car I sold you in 1989.

280
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,878
This is the car you sold me in 1989.
Best 300 quid I ever spent.

281
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,290
This is The Beast?
Yeah.

282
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,849
Pretty much. I mean, she's
had a bit of work done.

283
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,052
I had to replace the brakes,
suspension, exhaust, seats, wheels,

284
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,455
paneling, carburetor, manifold, the whole
engine, really, mirrors, headlamps.

285
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,991
Other than that,
she's the same old motor.

286
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,335
You could almost
say an antique.

287
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:58,636
Well, then let's get this
antique on the roadshow.

288
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,217
Come on, you bellends.
We're going to be late.

289
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,619
And we're back.
Just like the Five Musketeers.

290
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,311
Three Musketeers, isn't it?

291
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,878
Four if you count D'Artagnan,

292
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,880
Well, nobody knows how many there
were, really, do they, Pete?

293
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,214
I mean, history's a sketchbook.

294
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,251
You do know that <i>The Three
Musketeers</i> is a fiction, right?

295
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,352
Written by Alexandre Dumas?

296
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,162
A lot of people are saying that
about the Bible these days.

297
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,289
What, that it was written by
Alexandre Dumas?

298
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,497
Don't be daft, Steve,
it was written by Jesus.

299
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,593
Oh. Anyway, five
sounds much better.

300
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,028
I think they missed a trick
only having three.

301
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,998
'Cause you'd have five, then two could've
died and they'd still have three left.

302
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,910
Are we there yet?
Let's do this!

303
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,962
Soup Dragons!
I remember this one.

304
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,720
I put this on a tape
for you, didn't I?

305
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,888
Yeah, this is it.

306
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,961
This is the tape?
Yeah, yeah! Look, look.

307
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,663
Where did you find it?
It was in the tape player.

308
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,401
Oh, look. Is anyone hungry?

309
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,707
I need a piss actually.

310
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,919
This is a long piss.

311
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,715
If it is a piss.

312
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,284
Might be a little...
Poo.

313
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,730
How is that a poo?

314
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:31,556
Still work for your old man, Pete?
Yeah. I'm a partner now.

315
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,624
You?

316
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:36,728
Yeah, started my own firm in '98.
Got bought out in '05.

317
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,470
I'm happier, though.
It's less stress.

318
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,131
Ollie?
Property.

319
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,668
I co-manage a boutique estate
agency in North London.

320
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,903
Very competitive.

321
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,839
Is it family law you're in, Andy?
Corporate.

322
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,107
Does anyone know
what Gary's doing?

323
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,009
He's playing <i>Need For Speed.</i>
Over there.

324
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,345
Come on, come on, come on!

325
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,386
He hasn't changed, has he?

326
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:59,320
I don't know. He did finally
pay me back that £600.

327
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,589
Really? He borrowed £200 off me.
And me.

328
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,364
I can't believe it.
I can't believe you'd do that!

329
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,832
Oh! Of course I can.

330
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,839
It's just robbing
Peter to pay Paul.

331
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,601
No, I borrowed it from Peter to pay you.
I still owe Paul.

332
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,975
Oh, shit.

333
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,683
Newton Haven.

334
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:31,750
Take a moment to look upon it in its original
colors, boys, for tonight we paint it red.

335
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,335
Oh, no, no, no. Shit.

336
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,363
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

337
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,665
Fuck, fuck.

338
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,800
Oh, no, it's okay,
I did it all in the services.

339
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,476
Know why I pulled
you over, sir?

340
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,143
Was the music too loud?

341
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,723
Your left brake light is faulty.
Oh!

342
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,649
The old brake lights! So called
because they're always breaking.

343
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,993
I'll get that sorted out,
Officer.

344
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,292
Can I see your license, sir?
Yup.

345
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,690
Ah!

346
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,158
You know what?
It's in my wallet.

347
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,994
And I left that
at the bloody gym!

348
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:20,632
Any other form of identification?
No, it's all in my sports bag.

349
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,201
That's bloody typical,
isn't it? Um...

350
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,304
I'll give you my name and address, you
can run me through the old system.

351
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,340
Go on then.

352
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,474
It's Peter Page.

353
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:34,356
48 Bishop's Gardens,
London, N2 T12.

354
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,118
Jesus, Gary! WTF? Why did
you give him my name?

355
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,621
I'm not gonna give
him my name, am I?

356
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,088
Suppose I get done
by the police?

357
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,432
You won't get done
by the police.

358
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,434
Gary, he will check the number
plate against his name!

359
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,193
I know. Why do you think
I gave him Pete's name?

360
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,096
Jesus Christ, Gary, I own a car showroom.
I am a junior partner.

361
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,597
This is...

362
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,702
Just trust me.

363
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,036
So, Mr. Page, what brings
you to Newton Haven?

364
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,006
Well, we're all from here. We're
just back to see the sights.

365
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,008
Have a crack at
the old Golden Mile.

366
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,376
Might get a bit messy.

367
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,544
Well, you make sure you get
that brake light fixed

368
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,151
and you might want to do
an emissions test, too.

369
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,149
Oh, and, Peter.

370
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,390
Don't make too much mess.

371
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,725
We won't!

372
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,023
Hmm.

373
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,289
I don't understand.

374
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,225
It's simple, Pete.

375
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:23,228
The car's still registered to
you, it has been since 1989.

376
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,663
But I've moved
three times since then.

377
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,231
I know, I changed the log book.

378
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,033
Where do you think
all those points came from?

379
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,240
Jesus. You guys need to relax.

380
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,786
Do you know how much
trouble you could get into?

381
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,454
Do you know how much
trouble I'm already in?

382
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,689
What's that supposed to mean?

383
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,025
Hey. What the hell is this?
Why are we even here?

384
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,628
We are here to get annihilated.

385
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,931
Have you got any plans
for dinner at all?

386
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,867
Tonight, we will be partaking
of a liquid repast

387
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,236
as we wend our way
up The Golden Mile.

388
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,006
Commencing with an inaugural
tankard at The First Post,

389
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:11,176
then onto The Old Familiar, The
Famous Cock, The Cross Hands,

390
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,644
The Good Companions,
The Trusty Servant,

391
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,879
The Two Headed Dog, The Mermaid,
The Beehive, The King's Head

392
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,915
and The Hole in the Wall
for a measure of the same.

393
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,785
All before the last bittersweet
pint in that most fateful terminus,

394
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,053
The World's End.

395
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,121
Leave a light on, good lady,

396
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,523
for though we may return
with a twinkle in our eyes,

397
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,731
we will, in truth,
be blind drunk.

398
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,876
Come on!

399
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,850
Until 1840...
Fucking hell.

400
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,953
...this building was the site of
Newton Haven's first post office.

401
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,988
Until an enterprising
business fellow decided that

402
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,025
far from befitting the sending
and receiving of mail

403
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,227
it was perhaps better
suited as a humble taproom

404
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:13,005
where a weary traveler might get Matted.
Come on.

405
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,135
Ah!

406
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,774
It's like déjà vu.

407
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,078
I don't remember this at all.
Has it been refurbished?

408
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,047
Been bought by a chain,
hasn't it?

409
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,715
Part of that nationwide
initiative to rob

410
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,629
small, charming pubs
of any discernible character.

411
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,198
Starbucking, man.
It's happening everywhere.

412
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,290
Can't take away
that smell, though.

413
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,959
I'm sure they tried.

414
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,863
Good evening, Raymondo. The
prodigal sons return. Eh?

415
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,464
Who's on the
guest list tonight?

416
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,433
Come again?
The guest ales.

417
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:51,269
We, sir, are doing The
Golden Mile and you have

418
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,443
the honor of drawing
first blood.

419
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,177
What do you recommend? There's one.
Crowning Glory.

420
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,711
Rather fitting.
How's that?

421
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,612
I'm Gary King.
What?

422
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,914
So tell me more.
About what?

423
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,250
Crowning Glory. Is it nutty?
Is it foamy? Is it happy?

424
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,986
Does it have a surprisingly fruity
note which lingers on the tongue?

425
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:10,321
Hmm. It's beer.
Hmm.

426
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,723
We'll have five
of those, please.

427
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,728
No. Sorry. Can we have four of
those and a tap water, please?

428
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,400
What?

429
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,405
I don't believe this,

430
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:32,082
a man of your legendary prowess
drinking fucking rain.

431
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,879
It's like seeing a lion
eating some hummus.

432
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,048
That doesn't make any sense. I
know it doesn't make any sense.

433
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,684
You seriously have a problem with me
not drinking, after what happened?

434
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,320
I don't, but King Arthur does!
Oh, this'll be good.

435
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:43,823
What's King Arthur
got to do with it?

436
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:47,234
Do you honestly think that King Arthur
came back from the Battle of Hastings,

437
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:50,795
fucking rocked up at Arthur's Castle...
Camelot.

438
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,063
...walked up to the bar
and went,

439
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,998
"Hello.
Could I have a tap water?"

440
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,502
No, because they didn't have
running water in Arthurian times.

441
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:00,505
Exactly. He would have had a mead.
The King Arthur of beers.

442
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,679
And I'm less of a man because
I choose to drink water?

443
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,375
Well, it's a bit
"ooh ducky", innit?

444
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,743
That's not very PC, Gary.

445
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,645
Get out of the '90s, Pete.

446
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,648
There's nothing "ooh ducky"
about being teetotal,

447
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,184
about walking into a pub
after a rugby match

448
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:17,655
and ordering a tap water at a bar packed
full of big ugly bastards wearing warpaint.

449
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,892
That, my friend, takes confidence, yeah?
I'm talking balls.

450
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,566
You said it, poof.

451
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:27,234
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Gary, but we are not teenagers anymore.

452
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:29,867
And God forbid you ever have
children, because if...

453
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,035
I might have kids.

454
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,538
Then you had better be ready
to take responsibility...

455
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,242
No. I mean I might have kids.

456
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,786
You remember Karen
Eggerton, who I fucked?

457
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,713
She was two weeks late when her
parents emigrated to Normandy.

458
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,554
I never heard from her again.
She might have had a baby.

459
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,230
Imagine that? A French kid.

460
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,990
It's pointless arguing
with you.

461
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,461
To kids.
Wherever they may be.

462
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:53,392
Kids.
Kids.

463
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,966
Drink up. Let's Boo-Boo.

464
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,630
"Boo-Boo".
What is that?

465
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,966
You remember,
"Let's Boo-Boo."

466
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,068
You know, from Mr. Shepherd's
classroom, it said on the wall,

467
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,671
"Exit, pursued by a bear," you
know, from that Shakespeare play?

468
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,506
<i>A Winter's Tale.</i>
Yeah. What was it called?

469
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,841
<i>A Winter's Tale.</i>
That's it.

470
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,944
And if we needed to make a quick getaway,
we'd say, "Exit, pursued by a bear,"

471
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,947
and then it was,
"Exit, pursued by Yogi Bear,"

472
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,881
and then it was just,
"Let's Yogi and Boo-Boo,"

473
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,156
and then, "Let's Boo-Boo."

474
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,603
So you're saying we should go?
Yeah. it's shit here, innit?

475
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:26,592
Ah!

476
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,604
The Old Familiar.
Now this is a pub.

477
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,838
Yes.
This is more like it.

478
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,078
Like déjà vu.

479
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:48,613
David, my man, have you heard the news?
Gary King is back in town.

480
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:49,649
Who's he?

481
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,673
How was the funeral, Gary?

482
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,306
Your mum's funeral?

483
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,474
It's difficult to
put into words.

484
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:18,287
But if I had to choose
three, I would say,

485
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,687
"Really, really sad."

486
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,385
Oh, no, that's two, isn't it?

487
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,292
How about, "Really, very sad"?

488
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:31,530
It's a shame,
she was a good woman.

489
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,025
I really liked your mum.

490
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,973
Me, too, mate. Me, too.

491
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,730
Hello.
Hello, mate.

492
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,832
Are you here?

493
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,835
Yeah, I've been here for ages.
What are you talking about?

494
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,846
You get lost on the
ring road again?

495
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,505
This is Newton Haven.

496
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,315
What time are you meeting The Twins?
Twins?

497
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,047
We're all at The Old Familiar.
Come by if you want.

498
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:57,656
Yeah, he is. Okay.
See you soon.

499
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,188
Who was that, O-Man?

500
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:03,855
Don't call me O-Man, Gary.
If you must know it was Sam.

501
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:04,889
Sam's here?
Sam's here?

502
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,892
Is there a fucking echo in here?
Yes, Sam's here.

503
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:10,194
She's down from Manchester. We're
driving to Mum's tomorrow.

504
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,429
What, and she's coming here?

505
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,865
Calm down, Steve, I saw her first.
Jesus Christ, not this again.

506
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:17,735
Are you fucking kidding me?
I saw her first.

507
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,114
You really have a selective
memory, don't you?

508
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,706
Somebody else was saying that.

509
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,574
Me. No. I would have remembered.

510
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,510
I told you I had
a thing about Sam

511
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:28,079
and you proceeded to try and get
in her pants at every opportunity.

512
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,147
Guys, please.

513
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,482
You only liked her after
you found out I liked her!

514
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,351
That's right, because you
did the school play.

515
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:35,386
Cabaret. Cabaret.
Because she was in it.

516
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,322
And she wore those fishnet stockings
and you got a big boner on stage.

517
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,490
Jesus Christ.

518
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,593
Doesn't matter anyway, she always had
a massive wide on for Adrian Keane.

519
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:43,828
I hated that prick.

520
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:48,437
Can we not talk about
my sister in relation to,

521
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:51,769
A, massive wide ons,
B, Steven's erect penis?

522
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,271
All right.

523
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,252
Is she still fit, though?
I'm not answering that.

524
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,074
Is she, though?

525
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,578
Am I what?
Fit.

526
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,814
Hello, Sam. Steven? You've
grown, haven't you?

527
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,850
Yeah, sideways.
You look fantastic.

528
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,318
Steroids.

529
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,188
Andy, longtime.

530
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,822
Hi, Pete.
Hi, Sam.

531
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:12,824
All right, big brother?

532
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,526
Gary.

533
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,963
<i>Willkommen. Bienvenue.</i>
Welcome.

534
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,124
Sam. Would you like a drink?

535
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,067
Hey, Steve. She's just got here.
Come on.

536
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,268
Sam. Would you like a drink?

537
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,504
I'll have a vodka tonic,
thanks, Steven. Sure.

538
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,025
I'm just going to nip to the loo.
Cool.

539
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,120
Nature calls.

540
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,850
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

541
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,831
I'm going to the toilet.
Well, then, so am I.

542
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,523
Gary! You are
out of your mind!

543
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:46,969
What are you talking about?
You gave me the sign.

544
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,799
What sign?
You went to the toilet.

545
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,829
Gary, are you serious? I
haven't seen you in 20 years.

546
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,432
Do you really think I'm going to have
sex with you in the ladies' toilet?

547
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,167
Well, the disableds
is out of order.

548
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,202
Gary. What happened?
I don't know,

549
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,471
maybe one of them put too many
paper towels down the toilet.

550
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,872
I mean, we don't know what they
are thinking, really, do we?

551
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:05,009
No. What happened to you?

552
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,148
Nothing.

553
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,056
Nothing happened to me.
I'm the same old Gary.

554
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,158
No shit.
Huh!

555
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,554
So, do you wanna?

556
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,954
Oliver. I'll see you later.
You're going?

557
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,156
I thought you weren't meeting The
Twins for another half hour?

558
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:22,036
I'm not. Oh, yeah.
I believe this is yours.

559
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:30,709
"Out of order."
It's a private joke.

560
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:32,882
I don't want to know.

561
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,854
- What is that?
- Modern art.

562
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:50,955
It's a memorial, isn't it?

563
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,299
Yeah. To modern art.

564
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,678
Hey. guys, do you
know what time it is?

565
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,594
It's not even 6:00.

566
00:29:56,595 --> 00:30:00,564
Wrong! it's high time
we got onto The Cock!

567
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:01,600
Whoo-hoo!

568
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,313
Let's go.

569
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,908
Come on.

570
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,727
When you're ready, mate.

571
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,024
Oh, shit.
Look who it is.

572
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,225
Basil. Mad Basil!

573
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:26,791
Do you remember?
We used to come in here

574
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:31,502
and listen to him talk about fucking UFOs
and lizard people and underwater Nazis.

575
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,473
Didn't he spout some
bullshit about the Bermuda Triangle

576
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,665
actually being a square?

577
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,868
No, he said it was two isosceles
triangles forming a rhombus.

578
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,170
He was your best mate,
wasn't he, Steve?

579
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,706
No, he wasn't my
best mate, Gary.

580
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:43,908
He was a lonely, old guy and
I felt a bit sorry for him.

581
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,752
That's right. Basil!

582
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,081
Maybe we're not the local
legends you think we are.

583
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:51,749
Gary King?
Speak for yourself, mate.

584
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,161
You're barred.

585
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,589
I cannot fucking believe this.
This is ridiculous.

586
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,757
Believe me, Gary,
it's not worth it.

587
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:02,432
Have two in the next one. Have them
all in the next one, for all I care.

588
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:05,322
We've got to have one in every pub
otherwise the whole thing's fucked.

589
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,273
I'd say it was fairly
fucked already, mate.

590
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:08,544
Great.

591
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,542
How much more of this
do we have to endure?

592
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,545
That was three. There's nine more.
Oh, good.

593
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,613
Fuck that.
I need to eat something.

594
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,948
We can get some food
in the next pub.

595
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,983
As long as it's
reasonably healthy.

596
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,486
This is Newton Haven.

597
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,653
Hardly the heart of the
organic revolution.

598
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,355
I doubt it's the
heart of anything.

599
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:35,226
My wife wanted us to go organic,
problem is, I kinda like eating shit.

600
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,173
The next pub does shit!
Keep up!

601
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,734
Oh, yeah.
I remember this one.

602
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,908
- We had New Year's in here, didn't we?
- '89 into '90.

603
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,038
Isn't that when you
slept on the pool table, Andy?

604
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,109
Yeah. I believe it was.

605
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,617
For six hours.
Six hours.

606
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,310
Thank you for reminding me.

607
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,348
Do you remember
when you woke up,

608
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,717
we said you'd been asleep for
a year and that it was 1991

609
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,279
and you freaked out
and punched a clock?

610
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:03,560
That was a great night.

611
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,632
Didn't you manage to get off
with Erika Leekes, Peter?

612
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:08,600
Yes, I did. Something of a personal
triumph, if I say so myself.

613
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,629
She of the Marmalade Sandwich fame?
Marmalade Sandwich...

614
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,631
The very same.

615
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,633
Erika Leekes, Tracy Benson,
Becky Salt.

616
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,568
Two blondes and a redhead
in the middle.

617
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:20,604
The Marmalade Sandwich.
Becky Salt. Fucking hell.

618
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,839
Wonder what they're doing now.

619
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,040
Why don't you ask them?

620
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,076
What do you mean?

621
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:27,745
I mean, sitting at that table over there are
two blondes and a redhead in the middle.

622
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,113
Shut the fuck up.

623
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,449
I'd say that's Erika Leekes on the
left, Tracy Benson on the right,

624
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,517
and by process of elimination,
there's Becky Salt in the middle.

625
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,453
That's the Marmalade Sandwich
all growed up.

626
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,188
That is very spooky.

627
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,889
We should get them over.
No.

628
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,424
Leave the past where it is.

629
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,092
It's bad enough having to
look at your old, ugly mugs.

630
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,562
You make it sound like
we're fucking ancient.

631
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,596
We haven't changed that much.

632
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,832
I mean, sure, Steve's let
himself go a bit. What?

633
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,601
Pete's got the same haircut and Oliver
has still got his mark of the devil.

634
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:51,869
No, he hasn't No, he hasn't.

635
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,103
It's called
laser surgery, Gary.

636
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,673
It's a small price to pay for
not being called fucking O-Man.

637
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,374
That works for Sisters of
Mercy tattoos as well.

638
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,752
I still like the
Sisters Of Mercy.

639
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,151
Well, good job,
or you'd never go swimming.

640
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,545
I'm lost.
Don't be.

641
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,288
Well, I for one, think it's nice
to see the old faces again.

642
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,451
Cheers, mate.

643
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,095
Excuse me? This taken?

644
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,460
Is this seat taken?

645
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,227
Have it, mate.

646
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,660
Thanks.

647
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:20,197
Wasn't that...
Shane Hawkins.

648
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,032
Hey, didn't he...
Yes, he did.

649
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,268
Hang on. What happened
with Shane Hawkins again?

650
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,681
I'd rather not bring it all
up again, if that's okay.

651
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,440
Hey, man. Listen, Pete.

652
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,208
Bottling up past trauma
can lead to

653
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,512
inadequate coping strategies
in later life, apparently.

654
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,947
I don't know, I mean, it's not
even about the past, you know.

655
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:40,150
It's not about the fact
that he bullied me,

656
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,597
that he made me miss more
school days than chicken pox.

657
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:46,224
It's not even that he forced me to spend
entire lessons hiding in a toilet cubicle,

658
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,600
or that he punched me so hard
he dislodged my eyeball.

659
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,742
And it's not even that he ruined
a large portion of my childhood.

660
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:57,108
No, it's the fact that just
then, he didn't recognize me.

661
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:01,340
He looked straight through me
like it all meant nothing.

662
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,608
That probably sounds weird,
doesn't it?

663
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,110
Shots!

664
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:09,285
S-H-O-T-S. Shots.

665
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,620
What are you doing, Gary?

666
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,829
I thought it was obvious.
Shots.

667
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,552
Firstly, Peter was talking
about something

668
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,986
which clearly made him
feel very uncomfortable.

669
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,160
It's all right, Andy.
No, Peter, it's not all right.

670
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:23,200
Secondly, 12 pints is more than enough,
and thirdly, I don't fucking drink!

671
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,396
But shots don't count, do they?

672
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,164
You said you wanted
to catch up and chew the fat.

673
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,008
I think you just
wanted to drink it.

674
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,568
We're not here as your friends.

675
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,242
We're just your
fucking enablers.

676
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,905
Enablers. That's a funny word, isn't it?
"Enabler."

677
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,640
Gary King And The Enablers.

678
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,309
That's a good name for a band, Steve.
Write that down.

679
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,550
Don't do a Gary, Gary.

680
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,679
Oh, is that a thing now, is it?
It's always been a thing.

681
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,414
You don't need us to
help you get fucked up,

682
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,191
you've done a perfectly
good job so far on your own.

683
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,320
I'm gonna go and see if
there's a bus back to London

684
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,654
if anyone wants to
come with me.

685
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:54,525
You can't go. This is special.
This is our anniversary.

686
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,926
It's not the anniversary, Gary.

687
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,561
We did this in June.
It's October.

688
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,363
Yeah, but it's the anniversary
of the year, isn't it?

689
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,265
Every year is the
anniversary of a year!

690
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,007
It's just not the
same anymore, Gary,

691
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,512
and it's not that the town's
changed, we have changed.

692
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,412
Yeah, well, you can't go,
'cause the buses are finished.

693
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,442
Then I'm gonna go back to the B&B.
You coming?

694
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,610
I could do with
an early one actually.

695
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,011
I should probably go
and find Sam.

696
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:15,732
Yeah, I'm gonna go
and find Sam with Oliver.

697
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,086
That's settled then, yeah?

698
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,190
You know what I think?
I think you're jealous.

699
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:26,358
Yeah, you've got your houses and your cars
and your wives and your job security.

700
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,630
But you don't have
what I have. Freedom.

701
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:34,038
You're all slaves and I'm free
to do what I want any old time.

702
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,977
And this is what you want?

703
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,542
You should grow up, mate.
Join society.

704
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,079
Yeah, but Mum died.

705
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:45,586
And we're all very sorry,
but now it's time to go home.

706
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,590
I thought we were home.

707
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,535
I can't help feeling sorry for him.

708
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,274
Don't.

709
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,817
Oh! Fuck! Piss!

710
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:33,236
Careful, the floors
a bit pissy.

711
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,894
Wasn't me.

712
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,274
That was me.

713
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,175
Did that back in '90.

714
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,283
1990.

715
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:51,975
Punched the shit
out of the wall.

716
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:55,549
I don't know why. Seemed
important at the time.

717
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:02,119
You guys look like you're
having a good night, though.

718
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,101
I'm doing The Golden Mile tonight.
You want to tag along?

719
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,967
We'll be like The Six Musketeers.

720
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,470
I said we're doing
The Golden Mile.

721
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,612
You think you're so cool,
don't you?

722
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:21,306
Huh?

723
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,474
But we were cooler.

724
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,209
We owned this town.

725
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,747
We paved the way for you lot.
Blazed a trail.

726
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,047
Hey! Look at me when
I'm talking to you!

727
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:32,119
Please don't.
Don't what?

728
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:33,917
You don't want to do that.

729
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,556
Don't I?

730
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,683
What?

731
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,623
You need to explain
this right now!

732
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:13,891
Andy, this kid
just attacked me.

733
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:14,958
Don't you dare
change the subject!

734
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,994
He smashed my head
in the mirror.

735
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:18,629
You know who I just spoke to?
Your mum!

736
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,265
And not from the afterlife.
From fucking Bournemouth.

737
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:22,399
Is that real?

738
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,934
She says she hasn't spoken
to you for eight months.

739
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,437
Andy...
His head just came off!

740
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,038
No, Gary, you are not gonna
wriggle out of it this time.

741
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,293
There's someone in here.

742
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:28,998
Andy, did you see...

743
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:08,999
WTF, Gary. WTF.

744
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,072
What the fuck does "WTF" mean?

745
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,713
What the fuck?
Oh, yeah.

746
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,240
This can't be happening.
Can it?

747
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,362
You said it, mate.

748
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,210
I can't believe it.

749
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,411
I know, mate.

750
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,323
I can't believe you
lied about your mum!

751
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,548
That was a white lie!

752
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:27,117
How is that a white lie?
She's not dead, is she?

753
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,322
Wait, wait, wait!
Where are you going?

754
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,200
To get help.
No, don't do that!

755
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,566
What, don't get help? We don't
know how far this goes.

756
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,129
Wait, who are you calling?
Vanessa.

757
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,230
Who's Vanessa?
My wife.

758
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,065
Why are you calling your wife?
Because she's my wife.

759
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,667
You just said we don't
know how far this goes.

760
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,303
I was just thinking about the pub.
Oh, well, there's a surprise.

761
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:47,704
I can't get through.

762
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:48,905
Can you get through to Sam?

763
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,607
I've got full bars and
I'm not getting through.

764
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:56,446
<i>I'm sorry, your call
cannot be connected at this time.</i>

765
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,858
Must be the network.

766
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:02,294
Holy shit.
This is all connected.

767
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:05,829
This explains why
everything's gone fuck up.

768
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,324
Everybody's been replaced
by one of these.

769
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:10,761
That's why no one recognized
us, Basil, Dave, Raymondo.

770
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:13,397
I thought it was weird'
Shane Hawkins.

771
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:17,367
Exactly. it's not us that's
changed, it's the town.

772
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,469
I'm right, aren't I, Andy?

773
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,838
Andy, aren't I right?
You're never wrong.

774
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,343
No, whatever the fuck's happening,
we can't stay in the gents forever.

775
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,319
Ten people have entered this
toilet in the last five minutes

776
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:29,112
and not a single one
has come back out again.

777
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,524
That's going to
look suspicious.

778
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,059
Gay loving.

779
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,159
And that's worse
than five dismembered bodies?

780
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,787
This is Newton Haven.

781
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:51,473
How's it looking?
Normal. Very normal.

782
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,646
I don't like it.

783
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:57,251
What do we do?
Let's finish our drinks.

784
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:11,588
I say we neck these and
get the fuck out of here.

785
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,989
To London?
To The Trusty Servant.

786
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,163
Are you fucking kidding?
Oh, yeah.

787
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,528
It's The Good Companions next.
I always mix those two up.

788
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,363
Are you saying we move
on to the next pub?

789
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,401
We should get in The Beast
and head back to London!

790
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,877
My brake light is broken.
So don't use the brakes!

791
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,070
I'm way over the limit. When
has that ever stopped you?

792
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,847
I don't want to put any more
points on Pete's license.

793
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,509
Andy can drive, he's teetotal!

794
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,088
Ah!

795
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,490
That's settles it then.

796
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:48,692
The last thing we need to do is
get pulled over by the police.

797
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:49,993
A, we're all drunk,

798
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,863
B, they might be in on it and,
C, we've got blood on our hands.

799
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:55,065
It's more like ink. We've
got ink on our hands.

800
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:58,835
So, has it got messy yet? What?

801
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,817
What are you, five pubs in?
Four.

802
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,687
Oh, not even halfway.
Plenty more fun to be had.

803
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,355
Enjoy your night, Peter.

804
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,549
Thank you.

805
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:12,556
Thank you.

806
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,087
Sorry.

807
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,322
The way I see it, we've told everybody
we were doing The Golden Mile.

808
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,390
You did.

809
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,159
If we suddenly jump in The Beast
now and head for the hills,

810
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,493
they're gonna know
that we know,

811
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,729
but if we keep doing what we're
doing and going where we're going,

812
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:26,796
then they're not gonna know.

813
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:27,998
Know what?
That we know.

814
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,502
I suggest we finish what we started
and leave quietly in the morning.

815
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:33,878
Wait. You're really suggesting...
We finish The Golden Mile.

816
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,509
It's pointless
arguing with him.

817
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,251
Drink up. Let's Boo-Boo.

818
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,286
<i>We're just five friends</i>

819
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:49,223
<i>on a night out,
having a good time.</i>

820
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,750
Drinking.
Ah!

821
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,151
Beer.
Pubs.

822
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,426
Shall we?

823
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,994
I feel a little
uncomfortable drinking this much.

824
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,029
It's like Dutch
courage, isn't it?

825
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,798
You know, when the English soldiers
used to drink Dutch gin before battle

826
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,200
to give them super strength.

827
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,736
You know, I thought that was to
numb the sense of impending doom.

828
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:13,837
Exactly.

829
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:16,876
We're just five friends on a
night out, having a good time.

830
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,063
I need the toilet.

831
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:42,932
Go on then. You've earned it.
Huh?

832
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,106
You're doing really good, Oliver.

833
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,907
He didn't make it this far last time.
I'm proud of him.

834
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,007
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

835
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,511
Yeah, five guys on a night
out, having a great time.

836
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:55,090
Pretending to have
a great time.

837
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:56,413
Are you pretending?

838
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:59,115
If we get out of here alive,
I'm going to kill you.

839
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:00,784
We're still in the dark, Gary.

840
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:03,391
Yeah, our families could be
in danger for all we know.

841
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:07,400
I know, my mum could be dead.
For reals this time.

842
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,538
Hey, why don't we just
ask somebody? Who?

843
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,805
The Reverend Green.
Come on. Wait.

844
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,734
What the fuck are you doing?

845
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,682
I'm going to go and have a little
chat with The Reverend Green.

846
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:22,444
You're going to buy drugs?

847
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,917
I am going to go over there and subtly
check if that is The Reverend Green

848
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:29,045
and if it is, I can ask him
what's going on,

849
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,548
and possibly buy some drugs.

850
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,515
But what if he's one of them?

851
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,718
No, me and The Reverend had
a highly sophisticated code

852
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,639
when discussing the purchase
of herbal narcotics.

853
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:41,064
If he doesn't understand me, it means he's
one of them and I will simply walk away.

854
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,426
Ah!

855
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,434
Have you got any drugs? I
don't do that anymore, Gary.

856
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,436
Do what?
That.

857
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,804
That why you're
in a suit, is it?

858
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,639
'Cause drug dealing is
not good enough for you?

859
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,808
There are no drug
dealers anymore, Gary.

860
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,710
I've got a proper job
in a proper office.

861
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,313
You had a proper office.
That was the gents' toilets.

862
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:05,482
Nothing wrong with doing
your business in the toilet.

863
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:08,123
Look, a lot has changed since
you have left. I know.

864
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,322
How much do you know?
A little.

865
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:11,660
How much is a little?

866
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:13,790
The town has been taken over
by robots full of blue stuff.

867
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:14,958
Shh. Keep your voice down.

868
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:16,326
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

869
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:18,795
Tell us then.
Well, they're not robots.

870
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,730
Do you even know
what robot means?

871
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,474
Course I do. It's like,
"Hello, I am a robot."

872
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:28,271
It means "slave" and believe
me, they are not slaves.

873
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:30,473
Are you their prisoner?
No, I am very happy.

874
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:31,646
Tell your face.

875
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:34,010
Hey! What's going on?

876
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,012
The town's been invaded
by robots who aren't robots

877
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,924
and The Rev's their prisoner.
I am not.

878
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:40,827
We're leaving first thing.
We can get you out of here.

879
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,987
I'm not going. It's not what you think.
This is for all our benefit.

880
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:47,458
You've said too much, Trevor.
Yeah, put a cork in it, Trevor.

881
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:49,826
I'm just trying to help.
It's not your place to help.

882
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:51,494
They will have
everything in hand.

883
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:52,530
Are you guys robots?

884
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,041
Well, the word robot actually
comes from an old Czech word...

885
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,645
<i>...robotnik...</i>
...meaning slave.

886
00:48:57,835 --> 00:48:59,702
And we are not slaves.
We are very, very happy.

887
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:00,909
And not robots.

888
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,505
Oh, my God,
are these guys robots?

889
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,706
Shut up about robots!

890
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,375
I say we shut up
about everything!

891
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:13,354
Trevor.

892
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:18,132
It's your supervisor.

893
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,961
Hello, Trevor.
Hello, sir.

894
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,767
But...

895
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:29,042
I understand.

896
00:49:49,954 --> 00:49:51,365
Thanks a bunch.

897
00:49:57,628 --> 00:49:59,039
What did I miss?

898
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,164
Your friends trying to help.

899
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,439
We don't need your help.

900
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:03,874
Well, what should we do?

901
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:07,608
I suggest you get on your way.

902
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,248
I think we should
do what he says.

903
00:50:12,076 --> 00:50:13,419
Okay.

904
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,324
Here we go.

905
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,790
Come on!
Gary.

906
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,192
Gary!

907
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,361
Let's just get in and
out of this one, yeah?

908
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,103
No more making new friends.

909
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:37,133
Gentlemen!
The prodigal sons return!

910
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,081
What will it be, one of
our guest ales perchance?

911
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:43,873
Might I recommend
five pints of Crowning Glory?

912
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,910
Rather fitting, wouldn't you say, Gary?
What? Sorry. What?

913
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,046
It's a delightful brew.
Hoppy, nutty, foamy,

914
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,187
Does it have a surprisingly fruity
note that lingers on the tongue?

915
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,930
You're obviously a connoisseur.

916
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,987
Then you'll already
know that it's a rare treat

917
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:01,991
for rogues, reverends, royalty
and all good folks between.

918
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,626
Five of those, please.

919
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,573
Welcome home, boys.

920
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,801
I don't remember him
being that friendly.

921
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:14,180
He's obviously one of them.

922
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:15,905
How can he be?
He remembered me.

923
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,373
We don't know
what they remember.

924
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,819
Maybe they
have selective memories.

925
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:20,877
Yeah, like what's his name?
Me.

926
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,812
Maybe he's one of the others.
Like The Reverend.

927
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,156
It is very hard
to tell, isn't it?

928
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,249
Yeah, I mean, is he one of
them or is he one of them?

929
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,084
Wait, wait, which ones
are the thems again?

930
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,359
Well, they're both thems,
aren't they?

931
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:30,720
But there's two ways
of saying it.

932
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,855
Is he one of them or
is he one of them?

933
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,157
We need different terms.

934
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:38,129
One for the people who aren't robots and
one for the robots who aren't robots.

935
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:44,404
All right, we need to be able to
differentiate between them, them and us.

936
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,436
Yeah, I think the pronouns
are really confusing.

937
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,438
Yes. I don't even
know what a pronoun is.

938
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,506
It's a word that can
function by itself as a noun

939
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,175
which refers to something
else in the discourse.

940
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:53,519
I don't get it.
You just used one.

941
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:55,011
Did I?
Yeah. "It" is a pronoun.

942
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:56,045
What is?
It.

943
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,113
Is it?
Christ.

944
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,983
Look, we just need a fucking word
so we can identify who's who.

945
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:04,763
He's a blank, she's a blank, those
two people are definitely blanks.

946
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:07,668
Sam.

947
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:10,271
I got this, Steve.

948
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,909
All right, Sam?
Oh, crumbs.

949
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,166
How's your night going?

950
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,511
Good. Sort of.

951
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,239
What do you mean "sort of"?

952
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,952
Well, it's weird, isn't it?

953
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:30,149
You come back and everything's
the same, but sort of different.

954
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,850
Different how?

955
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:33,528
Just weird.

956
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,096
How weird?

957
00:52:35,953 --> 00:52:36,954
What are you getting at, Gary?

958
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,566
Come with me.

959
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,892
Puck's sake, Gary, take a hint.

960
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,293
It's all right, I'm not
trying to have sex with you.

961
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:45,762
Why are we in the
disabled toilets then?

962
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,030
There's something I need
to tell you right now,

963
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,331
unless you do want to have sex,

964
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,432
in which case
I'll tell you afterwards.

965
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:50,434
Tell me right now.

966
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:51,934
Have you noticed anything
creepy about The Twins

967
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:53,069
apart from the fact
that they're twins?

968
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,505
Just because they're twins doesn't
automatically make them creepy.

969
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,240
It does a little bit.
You had sex with them.

970
00:52:57,241 --> 00:53:00,620
A, I did not, and, B, how
did you know about that?

971
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:03,613
A, it's a small town, B, I'm not
stupid and, C, they told me.

972
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:05,448
Right. Well, I did once,
but I was wasted,

973
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,350
which was creepy because it was
like there was four of them.

974
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,951
I am not proud of it.
I am a bit.

975
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,587
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
No, this is...

976
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:15,997
Are you okay, Sam?
Are you okay, Sam?

977
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,605
I need a cigarette.

978
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:21,130
Nobots?
How about Fauxbots?

979
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,166
I think we should get away
from the whole robots thing.

980
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,271
Steven?

981
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:25,907
What's he up to?

982
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,472
Oh, don't worry, he's probably just
trying to fuck Oliver's sister.

983
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:30,474
Andy.

984
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:33,949
Oh, my God,
that man is full of shit.

985
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,846
I know that's not
a surprise to you.

986
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,793
What did he say, Sam?
What did he say, Sam?

987
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:44,295
He said that Newton Haven has been taken
over by robots full of blue stuff

988
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,989
and if we don't do what they say,
they will make us their prisoners.

989
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,628
Did you believe him?
Did you believe him?

990
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,166
No, of course not.

991
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,173
Did you believe him?
Did you believe him?

992
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,433
What?

993
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,881
See?
Come on, Sam.

994
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:13,862
You know better than
to believe Gary King,

995
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:16,520
Oh, crumbs.

996
00:54:18,055 --> 00:54:19,033
Sam!

997
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:30,406
God!
You creepy bitches, get off!

998
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,151
Chuck us a ciggie.

999
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:48,519
Oh.

1000
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:53,790
Gary, what's happening?

1001
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,397
I told you in the disableds.
Oh, yes, you did.

1002
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:57,867
We should get inside, eh?

1003
00:54:58,095 --> 00:55:00,803
Otherwise people are going to
ask what the hell's going on.

1004
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:02,198
What the hell's going on?

1005
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:03,599
Steve, I got this.
Got what?

1006
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,935
Sam, he's not good
enough for you.

1007
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:07,003
What?
What?

1008
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:09,644
We've been through
some crazy shit tonight

1009
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:13,709
and it's really put things
in perspective for me,

1010
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:18,125
and if everything is as fucked up as it seems,
then there's something I need to tell you.

1011
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:23,152
You might think this is because
I've had seven pints, but it's not.

1012
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,154
It's not.

1013
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,526
I'm in love with you, Sam.

1014
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,392
I always have been,

1015
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:32,995
and it breaks my heart to see you waste
your affections on Gary fucking King.

1016
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,636
Hey, that's a bit harsh. Oh,
no, you've got it all wrong.

1017
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:37,934
There's nothing between...
And while I'm being honest,

1018
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:41,838
just to lay it all out there, I am
currently seeing a fitness instructor.

1019
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,250
She's 26 years old,

1020
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:46,175
but I would drop her in
a heartbeat if it meant

1021
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,814
that I had one last chance
with you.

1022
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,185
Steven, there's nothing
between me and Gary King.

1023
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:54,918
Oh, fuck.

1024
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:14,973
Sorry.

1025
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:24,551
Hey! Get your feet off her!

1026
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,766
Pop its head off! Pop its head
off like an aspirin bottle.

1027
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:39,865
Blue-bloods?

1028
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:42,231
Nothing suggested in
the last three minutes

1029
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,000
has been better than
Smashy-Smashy Egg Men.

1030
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,668
Nothing.
What the hell's going on?

1031
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:48,004
Did you guys think of a name for
the robots who aren't robots?

1032
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,439
I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.

1033
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,242
Well, we just had a barney with
two blanks in the beer garden.

1034
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,916
- We have to leave now!
- Agreed.

1035
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:00,349
Let's hit The Mermaid.

1036
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,118
Wait, what?
Number eight.

1037
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:03,152
"Number eight"?

1038
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,429
Oh, fuck.
Andy, what's happening?

1039
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:09,234
Gary thinks we should keep on with the
crawl because they know what we're doing,

1040
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,494
but they don't know that we
know what they're doing.

1041
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:14,772
And basically no one else
has a better idea, so fuck it.

1042
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:17,604
What?

1043
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:19,747
Wait!

1044
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,509
Guys! Guys!
I've got a better idea.

1045
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,544
I'm parked right round
here somewhere.

1046
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:31,147
Haul it. Just go!
Steven, tell them!

1047
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,416
Gary said they'll get us
if we try and leave now.

1048
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:36,057
We're way past leaving now.
Come on.

1049
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:51,269
Oh, yeah.

1050
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,970
This is what the kids want.

1051
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,404
This is a bit mad, isn't it?

1052
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:58,249
This is perfect. We can hide out in here.
I'll get the drinks in.

1053
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,875
Good plan, O-Man.
Hey!

1054
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:01,446
Keep an eye out for blanks.

1055
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:02,713
You've got it.

1056
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:17,126
Why didn't you say anything?
About what?

1057
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,970
About what you said
in the garden.

1058
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:21,630
I always wanted to.

1059
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,632
It just never seemed
like the right moment.

1060
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,601
Something always
got in the way.

1061
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,639
Here you go,
get these down you.

1062
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,239
Thanks.

1063
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:31,613
Steven?

1064
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:39,448
Please! I have so
much to live for!

1065
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,517
It's me, you numpty.
Basil!

1066
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,453
I knew seeing your faces again
would spell trouble.

1067
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,832
Wait. How do I know
it's really you?

1068
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:51,769
Because I'm the only one who's going to
tell you the truth about Newton Haven.

1069
00:58:52,596 --> 00:58:56,866
Now, do you recall the events of
the evening of June the 22nd, 1990?

1070
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,869
No, but I know a man who does.

1071
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:04,040
Here you go.
Hey.

1072
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,021
See anyone we know?

1073
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:13,886
The Marmalade Sandwich.
The Marmalade Sandwich.

1074
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:21,596
They look good.

1075
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,705
It's the lights.
It's the drink.

1076
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,270
Who cares what it is?

1077
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,243
Steven?

1078
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,641
Steven?

1079
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,309
That was the night
they arrived.

1080
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,545
Remember the shooting star?
That was them.

1081
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:43,889
Nothing happened at first.

1082
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:47,750
They were getting ready, burrowing
in underground, preparing.

1083
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,886
<i>Not long after you lot left,
people started to change.</i>

1084
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,798
<i>Just one or two at first,
then more.</i>

1085
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:56,336
They replaced people of influence,
taking over the institutions,

1086
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,802
<i>remaking, remodeling,
refurbishing.</i>

1087
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,850
Doing everything they could
to make us join them.

1088
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:13,477
I can't find Steven.
Where are the others?

1089
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:15,517
They're blending in.

1090
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:20,059
Oh, crumbs.

1091
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,352
It's not like the replacements
were evil, far from it.

1092
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:26,994
People got a lot friendlier.
That's how they do it,

1093
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:30,559
<i>It's not an invasion,
it's a merger.</i>

1094
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,541
<i>They don't want to get rid of
us, not if they can help it.</i>

1095
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:36,632
<i>They just want to make
us more like them.</i>

1096
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,534
<i>Change the way we think.</i>

1097
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:40,703
<i>Bring us into line
with all the others.</i>

1098
01:00:40,704 --> 01:00:42,706
<i>Become another
link in their chain.</i>

1099
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:45,551
<i>Which is fine,
unless you say no.</i>

1100
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,410
That's when you get replaced.

1101
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,713
Once they get your DNA,
they've got you.

1102
01:00:50,714 --> 01:00:51,881
How do they do that?

1103
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:53,215
<i>Any way they like.</i>

1104
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:59,064
<i>Blood tests, the nit nurse, sweat,
kissing, saliva on the rim of a glass.</i>

1105
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:02,358
Why do you think
I drink with this crazy straw?

1106
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:03,736
Not so crazy now, is it?

1107
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,975
If you're not on their side,
they'll create a version that is.

1108
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:11,277
<i>They can bring you back exactly the
same or even make you young again.</i>

1109
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,702
<i>It looks like you, it
even has your memories,</i>

1110
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:16,238
<i>but really it's just a vessel
to spread their message.</i>

1111
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:20,609
<i>Trust, love, respect, desire.</i>

1112
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,352
<i>Replaced in the name
of progress.</i>

1113
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,992
So, what happens to the
people who get replaced?

1114
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:30,186
The empties? Don't ask
me what happens to them.

1115
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,554
Why, what happens
to the empties?

1116
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:33,255
I told you not to ask me that!

1117
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,532
Go! Get out,
before it's too late!

1118
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,631
Basil?
I said go!

1119
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:47,114
This just can't be good.

1120
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:50,350
Sam, who was the boy that you
liked in sixth form? Adrian?

1121
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,654
Adrian Keane. Why?

1122
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,483
He's over there.

1123
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:07,161
Hey, Sam.
How's life?

1124
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:13,629
Sam, we have to get out of here!
We have to get out of here!

1125
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,803
Where are the others?
They're blending in.

1126
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:19,239
Oh, fuck!

1127
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:23,481
Gary! No, just one more song.

1128
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:25,874
Gary, she's a blank!

1129
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,309
Don't be so judgmental.

1130
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,311
Oh, for fuck...

1131
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,681
Oh, yeah.
Come on.

1132
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,292
Still got it.
Enough's enough.

1133
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,683
Let's go.

1134
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:36,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.
Hold up.

1135
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:38,391
Where are you all going?

1136
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,589
We're leaving.
Really? What happened?

1137
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,524
Adrian Keane was in that bar.
Prick.

1138
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,026
I thought you liked
Adrian Keane.

1139
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:45,728
Adrian Keane is dead.
Oh, God.

1140
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:48,797
Adrian Keane died in a motorbike
accident in Italy eight years ago.

1141
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:50,666
Did he? They must have
had his DNA on file.

1142
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:52,010
That's how they were
able to replicate him.

1143
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:54,322
They know how to get to us, man.
They know everything.

1144
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:57,039
They didn't know Adrian was dead.
They knew enough to tempt us.

1145
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,575
They knew these three would fall for
a bunch of girls in school uniform.

1146
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:03,078
Hey, who wouldn't? Am I right?
Fuck, yeah.

1147
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,213
We've gotta get out of town,

1148
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:05,625
we've gotta get beyond it
before it's too late.

1149
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:07,650
- Where are you getting all this from?
- Basil.

1150
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:10,953
Mad Basil? He of the Bermuda
Rhombus and the Aqua Nazis?

1151
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:13,188
Another good name
for the band, Steve.

1152
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,024
You're putting our lives in
the hands of a crazy old man?

1153
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:16,595
He's not crazy!
No, maybe he's not.

1154
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,694
Or maybe he's a blank trying to
lure us to the edge of town,

1155
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:21,196
onto those dark country roads
where they can deal with us.

1156
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:24,566
Yeah, we could end up dead in a field.
I hate fields.

1157
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:26,843
Yes. My thoughts precisely.

1158
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:29,405
Steven's right.
We should go.

1159
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:30,806
No, we're going to The Beehive.

1160
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,309
Gary's plan is still
the best we have.

1161
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:34,187
Wait a minute.

1162
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,718
The 1990-model Oliver was out of
commission by this point in the evening.

1163
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,152
What are you saying?

1164
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:46,288
I like the new you.
Huh.

1165
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,267
Come on.

1166
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:50,426
This is a mistake, isn't it?

1167
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:51,748
Hold up!
Just stick with me.

1168
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:53,533
Andy, come on!

1169
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:58,233
Here we go. Pub number nine.

1170
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,268
Fuck yes!

1171
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:01,749
That's the spirit, Pete!
Spirits! We should do chasers.

1172
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,238
Who is this guy?

1173
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:06,686
Come on. Andy!
It can't start without you.

1174
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:10,347
You what?

1175
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,918
We can't start without you.

1176
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:19,832
Now then.
Whose round is it?

1177
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:21,431
It's mine.

1178
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:24,902
Mr. Shepherd!
Is it Mr. Shepherd?

1179
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:29,268
Why don't you kids join me? You
look like you could do with a drink.

1180
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:35,806
Now, let's have a little chat
about your future, shall we, hmm?

1181
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:39,282
Uh, Mr. Shepherd?
Please, call me Guy.

1182
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:41,588
All right.

1183
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:44,280
Guy...

1184
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:46,692
Look at you.

1185
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,422
Are you a robot?

1186
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:53,601
Does anyone know
what robot means?

1187
01:04:53,757 --> 01:04:54,929
Yeah. I do!
Yes, Gary.

1188
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:56,925
It means "slave."

1189
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:58,906
Oh, very good, Gary.

1190
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,929
Are you a robot, sir?

1191
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,843
No, Peter, of course
I'm not a robot.

1192
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:04,945
Sir?
Yes, Steven.

1193
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,468
But you're on their
side, though?

1194
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,211
This is not about
sides, Steven.

1195
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,511
It's not about shirts
versus skins.

1196
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:15,282
It's about working
together as one team.

1197
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:18,983
I know it may seem a bit weird
and a little bit scary,

1198
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,788
but please believe me,
it's quite the opposite,

1199
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,552
They're here to help.

1200
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:27,000
To straighten us out. To
prepare us for the big league.

1201
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:30,668
They've seen something
in us, a potential.

1202
01:05:30,794 --> 01:05:33,331
There's a vast community
of worlds up there,

1203
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:37,706
living together, peacefully,
cooperatively.

1204
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:41,205
And guess what? They want
us along for the ride.

1205
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:45,245
Pretty cool, eh, gang?

1206
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:47,946
So,
they're not here to harm us?

1207
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:52,514
Far from it, O-Man.
No, they're here to help.

1208
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:55,384
I'm not saying they're
afraid to get tough.

1209
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:58,127
I certainly had to get
tough with you in my day.

1210
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:01,661
And what one amongst you
wouldn't thank me for it? Hmm?

1211
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:05,227
In some respects,
they're a lot like teachers.

1212
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:09,598
Stern, yes.
A little frightening.

1213
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,101
But it's all for
our betterment.

1214
01:06:12,035 --> 01:06:17,986
So, what do you say we all go somewhere
and talk about this properly?

1215
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:19,441
That wasn't properly?

1216
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:23,083
Well, I think it's pretty clear, guys, what
Mr. Shepherd is trying to say is that...

1217
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:28,025
Andy! What the fuck?

1218
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,730
Yes, Andy. What the fuck?

1219
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:39,396
Humans, you leave
us no recourse.

1220
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:42,610
If you will not
join us willingly,

1221
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:47,069
we will be forced to use
other means of persuasion.

1222
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,708
Now, please...

1223
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,956
I fucking hate this town!

1224
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:39,794
Oh, oh!

1225
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,240
Oh, crumbs, you're heavy. Sorry.

1226
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,164
Motherfucker!

1227
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:36,584
Andy!

1228
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:38,156
Twist the melon, man!

1229
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,361
Yeah!

1230
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:48,197
Sam, this is no way
for a family to behave.

1231
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,412
Sam, I'm disappointed in you.

1232
01:09:05,842 --> 01:09:07,844
O-Man!

1233
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,559
Okay, Andy.

1234
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,234
Break it up.

1235
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,567
It doesn't have
to be like this.

1236
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:35,808
It could be so much simpler,
so completely painless.

1237
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,840
If only you'd see the light.

1238
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,075
Yes.

1239
01:09:40,076 --> 01:09:43,683
See, it's not about conflict,

1240
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,449
it's about togetherness.

1241
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:50,556
Yes. Let's try this
again, shall we?

1242
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:52,155
How about another round?

1243
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:56,602
Nah, we're done here.

1244
01:09:57,393 --> 01:10:01,029
Yes, Gary, that appears to be the case.

1245
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,441
The Smokehouse!

1246
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,138
What?
Just do it!

1247
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,112
Come on!

1248
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,037
This way!

1249
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:20,916
Humans,
this is your final warning.

1250
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:23,193
Failure to comply
will result in your...

1251
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:28,424
Humans, obey now,
or face the consequences.

1252
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:32,795
Let's go!

1253
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,042
Shit.

1254
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:45,012
Oh, look, there's my car!

1255
01:10:47,844 --> 01:10:49,084
Let's climb down the drainpipe.

1256
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,816
I've got a better idea.

1257
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:56,763
Climb down the drainpipe.

1258
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,790
Okay, just go.

1259
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:02,824
Wait. What about the others?

1260
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:04,392
Leave 'em with me, okay?
I got this.

1261
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,304
Are you sure? Yeah, I
always land on my feet.

1262
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:08,150
I don't know
if that's true, Gary.

1263
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:09,665
Just go.

1264
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:12,034
Will you find out what
happened to my brother?

1265
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:15,705
Yeah, of course, of course, and
I'll look after Stevie for you, eh?

1266
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:19,046
He's a good guy.
He's better than me.

1267
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:23,314
Gary, you're not a bad person, but
you're not boyfriend material.

1268
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,082
The whole "free spirit quick one
in the disabled toilets" thing

1269
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:30,860
is kinda cool when you're 17,
but not when you're facing 40.

1270
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:35,335
There comes a time when you have
to go forwards and not backwards.

1271
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:39,359
Maybe if I hadn't left you behind that
night, things would all be different.

1272
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:41,800
It's not all about
that night, Gary.

1273
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:43,766
Isn't it?

1274
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,674
It doesn't have to be.

1275
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:49,964
We'll always have the
disableds, though, won't we?

1276
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,444
Yeah. Yeah, we'll always
have the disableds.

1277
01:12:15,598 --> 01:12:16,599
Oh, no.

1278
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:30,256
Where's Sam?

1279
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:31,719
I put her in her car.

1280
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:32,916
You did what?

1281
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:34,995
I put her in her car.
I just told her to leave.

1282
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,919
You just sent away the only one
of us sober enough to drive?

1283
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,255
Yeah. You just couldn't
stand the fact

1284
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:41,723
that she might
prefer me to you.

1285
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,397
That's not true.
It is true, Gary!

1286
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:45,433
I was getting somewhere.
We held hands.

1287
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,263
I was just trying to help! You were
trying to help yourself, more like!

1288
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:51,233
Jesus, I do something right for a
change and you fuckers get on my case.

1289
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:54,545
Wow, that's the first time I've
ever heard you admit being wrong.

1290
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,404
I said I did something right!

1291
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:57,672
Yeah, "for a change".

1292
01:12:57,673 --> 01:12:59,875
So? Meaning the rest
of the time you're wrong.

1293
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,543
Not necessarily.

1294
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:04,880
Look, I just thought it was best
to keep her out of harm's way.

1295
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,249
And what about us, Gary?
Aren't we in harm's way?

1296
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,951
We're all right, Pete. Come on,
we're The Five Musketeers.

1297
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:12,023
No, we're the Four Musketeers.

1298
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:17,637
Wait, how do we know
you put her in the car?

1299
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,961
How do we know you're you?

1300
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:21,162
Of course I'm me!

1301
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:24,474
Well, who the fuck are you, Gary?
I'm Gary King.

1302
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:27,602
There's only one Gary King. How
do I know you guys are you?

1303
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,014
We've been together
the whole time.

1304
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,507
You might all not be you. How did
you know O-Man wasn't O-Man?

1305
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:34,509
Because his birthmark was back.

1306
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:36,845
What does that prove?
Because of what Basil said.

1307
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:38,480
They make a copy from your DNA.

1308
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:39,848
That's why he had
his birthmark.

1309
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:41,316
He was new, like a baby.

1310
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:43,285
Like a man-baby.
Like a "maybe".

1311
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:45,527
Oliver with none of the shit that
had happened to the real Oliver.

1312
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:47,722
The laser surgery!

1313
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:49,168
So the blanks really
are just blank?

1314
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,539
No wear and tear, no scars.

1315
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,430
Steven, in 1987 we were playing
cricket and I accidentally pushed you

1316
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,632
onto a broken bottle that
nearly went up your ass.

1317
01:13:57,633 --> 01:13:58,907
So?
Show us your bum.

1318
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,374
Very nice.
Thank you.

1319
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,044
Pete, you got that 50cc
Suzuki in 1988,

1320
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:11,206
and you let me have a go on it
and I ran over your leg.

1321
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:14,582
What the fuck?

1322
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,722
Oh, wait, it's the other one.

1323
01:14:19,255 --> 01:14:22,429
Andy, in 1986 we re-enacted
the Knife Game from <i>Aliens</i>

1324
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:23,992
and I stabbed you
in the middle finger.

1325
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:27,696
How about December 1997,
when you OD'd

1326
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:30,632
and I drove you to the hospital
four times over the limit

1327
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:34,636
and I ended up rolling the car and
almost severing my femoral artery,

1328
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:37,439
at which point you made
a miraculous fucking recovery

1329
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,709
and ran off into the night,
leaving me to get arrested

1330
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:42,747
after 12 hours of
life-saving surgery?

1331
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:44,552
Either one of those will do.

1332
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,151
Thank you.
What about you?

1333
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,594
That's easy.

1334
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:54,956
That could have been drawn on.
Aren't all tattoos drawn on?

1335
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:57,233
- Yeah.
- Show us your arm.

1336
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:00,603
What?
Show us your arm.

1337
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:02,734
No, no.

1338
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:07,669
You fell off stage at the fifth-year ball
fucking around and dislocated your elbow.

1339
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,904
You've got a scar where they
put the metal plate in.

1340
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,806
I don't have to show
you anything, all right?

1341
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:14,175
I'm Gary King.
I know I'm me.

1342
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:17,212
If I'm not me, then how do I know that
carved into that beam above your head

1343
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:19,247
are the words "King Gary"?

1344
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:20,448
But it doesn't say "King Gary".

1345
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:22,929
Yes, it does.
Doesn't it?

1346
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:25,920
No. It says "King Gay".

1347
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,800
Some cunt scrubbed out the "R"!

1348
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,392
- That was me.
- Why?

1349
01:15:30,393 --> 01:15:33,028
"King Gay".
That means fuck-all anyway.

1350
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,168
Mr. Shepherd remembered
stuff, so did Oliver.

1351
01:15:35,431 --> 01:15:37,468
Selective memory, remember?

1352
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:43,448
We don't see you for years and you
just pitch up and bring us here.

1353
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:46,446
You better come out with some
hard evidence that you're human,

1354
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:49,352
otherwise we're going to
find out for ourselves.

1355
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,852
You want evidence?

1356
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:55,488
There!

1357
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:01,291
That proves I'm human!

1358
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:02,557
It proves you're stupid.

1359
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,892
Exactly!

1360
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,372
Ow!

1361
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:06,802
It's Gary.
It's Gary.

1362
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,133
The whole town's
out looking for us.

1363
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:15,172
That's a good thing. If everybody's
outside, that means nobody's inside.

1364
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,642
Gary, wait! Fuck!

1365
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,411
Gary, Gary! What do
you mean "nobody's inside"?

1366
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,846
I mean we can still do this!

1367
01:16:24,847 --> 01:16:26,014
Do what exactly?

1368
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:27,615
Oh, we're still on the crawl.

1369
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:31,759
"King Gay".

1370
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,227
Peter?

1371
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,496
Peter.

1372
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:41,641
I thought that was you.
Are you okay?

1373
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:43,667
Am I what?

1374
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,868
I know we didn't see
eye to eye at school.

1375
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:49,076
Goodness knows I regret that.

1376
01:16:49,672 --> 01:16:51,406
I wanted to say something
back at the pub,

1377
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:54,354
but I felt so terribly
ashamed by what I'd done.

1378
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:58,653
Let me make it up to you, Peter.
Please.

1379
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:04,119
Gary, you're out of your mind!
We've come too far.

1380
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,186
It's fucking suicide.

1381
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:09,023
I know. We are going to get to
The World's End if it kills us.

1382
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:10,825
Where's Pete?

1383
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,567
I hate you!

1384
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:15,401
You fucking bastard!
I hate you!

1385
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:18,833
Pete! Leave it! Why are
you doing this, Peter?

1386
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:19,972
We don't want to hurt you.

1387
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:22,709
Come on, mate!
It's not worth it!

1388
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,048
Yes, it fucking is!

1389
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:27,587
What's he doing?

1390
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:29,415
Oh, shit.

1391
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:31,313
Peter...

1392
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:34,393
Peter...

1393
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:39,729
I must say, I'm very
disappointed in you, Peter.

1394
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:46,028
I'll punch their
fucking lights out.

1395
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,808
Andy! No, no, no,
there's too many of them.

1396
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:56,438
Pete.

1397
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,151
Peter.

1398
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,752
We gotta go.
Gary's right.

1399
01:18:10,753 --> 01:18:12,587
We gotta get to The King's Head.
Exactly.

1400
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:13,726
What?

1401
01:18:14,957 --> 01:18:17,759
We are not going to The King's Head.
We're done.

1402
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,727
We're going to do what we should
have done in the first place.

1403
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,049
Get The Beast and
get out of here.

1404
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:24,277
We are fucking leaving
and we are never coming back.

1405
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:27,235
Now, you can either
come with us willingly

1406
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:30,238
or I'm gonna knock you the fuck
out and carry you there myself.

1407
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,307
You choose.
All right. All right.

1408
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:36,044
Just think about what you're saying, you
know, because you have been drinking.

1409
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:37,046
You fuck.

1410
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,471
Shit, it's those fucking kids.

1411
01:18:56,632 --> 01:18:58,134
Not them again.

1412
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:05,006
What the hell is that?

1413
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:07,487
I don't know, but it's
definitely not modern art.

1414
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:20,388
Oh, shit, we're trapped.
Where's The Beast?

1415
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:24,826
Okay, all right. We're here, so
The Beast is in the next street.

1416
01:19:24,827 --> 01:19:25,994
How are we gonna get to it?

1417
01:19:25,995 --> 01:19:27,996
We'll have to go through.
Through where?

1418
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:29,874
I don't fucking believe this.

1419
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:32,875
Number 10.

1420
01:19:36,672 --> 01:19:37,673
Come on.

1421
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:41,954
Let's go.

1422
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,422
The backdoor, back door.
Let's go.

1423
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:46,348
Here we go.

1424
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:50,519
Okay, there it is.

1425
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,321
Shit.

1426
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:56,724
We wait for an opening, and
then we leg it to The Beast.

1427
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,329
We need the keys.

1428
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:02,035
Gary?

1429
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:06,573
Gary, what are you doing?

1430
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,370
Just a little toast.

1431
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:12,373
Gary, put the pint down, yeah?

1432
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:15,412
To Oliver, Pete.

1433
01:20:16,612 --> 01:20:17,590
And to us.

1434
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:20,384
You know, 'cause
10 pubs isn't bad,

1435
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:24,563
It's not, but
we're calling time.

1436
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:27,556
Okay.

1437
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,914
So close.

1438
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:48,945
Number 10.

1439
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:51,914
Okay.

1440
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:53,888
So close.

1441
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:02,497
No, no, no, no,
no. Gary!

1442
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:05,593
Gary! Gary!

1443
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:08,006
Let him go.
He left you, man.

1444
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:09,766
I can't.

1445
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:11,600
Andy!

1446
01:21:22,511 --> 01:21:24,650
Gary! Gary!

1447
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,625
Gary, come back! Come
back, you stupid bastard!

1448
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:55,916
Gary!

1449
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:58,955
Gary! Gary!

1450
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:24,372
Andy, look out!

1451
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:42,234
Come on!

1452
01:22:44,193 --> 01:22:45,194
What the...

1453
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:50,473
Get in. Get in.

1454
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,711
Gary, Andy, get the fuck in!

1455
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:56,811
You heard him, Andy.
Get the fuck in.

1456
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,814
We haven't much time!

1457
01:23:10,252 --> 01:23:12,823
Andy! Go, now!
Steven!

1458
01:23:13,889 --> 01:23:15,027
Go!

1459
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:35,988
Andy.

1460
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,450
I want you inside me.

1461
01:23:40,549 --> 01:23:41,550
Okay.

1462
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:47,990
Cheers.

1463
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,718
Ah!

1464
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:12,691
You've had enough!
This is The World's End, man!

1465
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:13,918
I know!

1466
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:15,684
Stop this!

1467
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:20,054
Leave me alone!
What do you care anyway?

1468
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:23,691
Of course I fucking care. There's
a reason I'm angry at you!

1469
01:24:23,692 --> 01:24:25,726
I know why you're angry
at me, okay?

1470
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:28,230
But it's not my fault
that you crashed that car.

1471
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:31,311
That's not the point.
You let me down, man.

1472
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:34,477
You were Gary King.
Gary fucking King.

1473
01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:39,173
I would have followed you to the end.
I fucking have!

1474
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:41,347
Then stop following me!

1475
01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:49,091
No! It's just one more.

1476
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:51,594
Let me have this.

1477
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:54,655
You've got everything you want.

1478
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,090
What are you talking about?

1479
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,994
You've got your perfect job and your
perfect house and your perfect wife.

1480
01:24:59,995 --> 01:25:01,406
You think it's so perfect?

1481
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:05,542
She left me, Gary.

1482
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:08,402
She took the kids to her
mum's three weeks ago,

1483
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:11,839
Said I'm not present enough.
I'm trying to win her back.

1484
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,474
And God knows I am losing.

1485
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:17,514
But I will continue to fight,
because that is how we survive.

1486
01:25:18,714 --> 01:25:22,783
For fuck's sake, Gary, I just punched
my wedding ring out of a robot's tummy.

1487
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,986
Exactly! You fight for
what's important.

1488
01:25:24,987 --> 01:25:27,054
But what is so important
about The Golden Mile?

1489
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,557
It's all I've got!

1490
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:30,428
Gary.

1491
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:53,085
You need help, Gary.

1492
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:56,795
I got help.
You know what help was?

1493
01:25:57,919 --> 01:25:59,987
Help was a lot of people
sitting in a circle

1494
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,934
talking about how fucking
awful things had got.

1495
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,925
That is not my idea
of a good time.

1496
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:07,998
And this is? They told
me when to go to bed.

1497
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:10,232
Me!

1498
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:16,504
Gary, mate, how can you tell when
you're drunk if you're never sober?

1499
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:18,416
I don't wanna be sober.

1500
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,412
It never got better
than that night.

1501
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:24,931
That was supposed to be
the beginning of my life.

1502
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:28,593
All that promise
and fucking optimism.

1503
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:32,364
That feeling like we could
take on the whole universe.

1504
01:26:33,055 --> 01:26:34,591
It was a big lie.

1505
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:38,526
Nothing happened.

1506
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,200
You don't need
to do this, Gary.

1507
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:44,604
Yeah, I do.

1508
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:50,640
<i>Please, stand by.</i>

1509
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,244
<i>Please, stand by.</i>

1510
01:26:56,645 --> 01:26:58,283
<i>Please, stand by.</i>

1511
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:01,994
<i>Please, stand by.</i>

1512
01:27:04,653 --> 01:27:05,631
Ah!

1513
01:27:48,964 --> 01:27:50,364
What are you doing?

1514
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:52,038
No, don't go out there.

1515
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:54,841
<i>Gary King.</i>

1516
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:57,211
Yeah?

1517
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:02,885
<i>Gary King of the humans.</i>

1518
01:28:03,245 --> 01:28:05,054
Yeah. What do you want?

1519
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:08,949
<i>We are here to enable
your full potential,</i>

1520
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:12,386
<i>as we have with countless
worlds across the galaxy.</i>

1521
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:14,958
Oh, yeah?
How'd you manage that, then?

1522
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:17,591
We appropriate a small
percentage of the population

1523
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:20,903
at 2,000 or so penetration
points across the planet.

1524
01:28:21,196 --> 01:28:24,006
This ensures maximum coverage.

1525
01:28:24,566 --> 01:28:30,037
From there, we create simulants
to spread our ideologies

1526
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:31,711
through peaceful
indoctrination.

1527
01:28:32,374 --> 01:28:35,981
Our objective is simple,
to ready the population

1528
01:28:36,111 --> 01:28:38,717
for participation in
our galactic community.

1529
01:28:39,447 --> 01:28:43,293
This method requires
a small sacrifice.

1530
01:28:43,451 --> 01:28:45,727
But the fewer
replacements we make,

1531
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:48,155
the more successful
we consider our operation.

1532
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:52,730
Of course, we welcome those
who volunteer themselves.

1533
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:57,773
We can offer attractive incentives
for those who willingly combine.

1534
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:01,643
The chance to be young again and
yet retain selected memories.

1535
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:05,148
Isn't that something
you'd like?

1536
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:08,419
Something you've always wanted?

1537
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:21,162
Oh, my God! I'm so cute!

1538
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:25,730
The beauty of our system
is that we all win.

1539
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:28,168
There are no losers.

1540
01:29:31,433 --> 01:29:34,107
Allow me to carry
your legend forward.

1541
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:38,713
Let the man you have become
be the boy you were.

1542
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:49,960
Nah.

1543
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:52,998
There's only one Gary King.

1544
01:29:54,990 --> 01:30:00,463
<i>Then you have made your choice,
Gary King of the humans.</i>

1545
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:02,329
Yeah, I have.

1546
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:07,334
Because frankly, who the fuck are you to
come down here and tell us what to do?

1547
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:11,839
<i>We are The Network and we are
here for your betterment.</i>

1548
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,307
<i>In the last 23 years,</i>

1549
01:30:13,308 --> 01:30:16,289
<i>have you not marveled as information
technology has surged forward?</i>

1550
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:17,845
No.

1551
01:30:17,846 --> 01:30:22,116
<i>Earth has grown smaller yet greater
as connectivity has grown.</i>

1552
01:30:22,117 --> 01:30:25,719
<i>This is our doing and it
is just the beginning.</i>

1553
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,223
Oh, fuck off, you big lamp.

1554
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:31,699
<i>You are children
and you require guidance.</i>

1555
01:30:32,193 --> 01:30:33,831
<i>There is no room
for imperfection.</i>

1556
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:37,837
Hey, Earth isn't perfect, all right?
And humans aren't perfect.

1557
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:40,377
And guess what?
I ain't perfect.

1558
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:43,837
<i>And therein lies the necessity
for this intervention.</i>

1559
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:48,442
<i>Must the galaxy be subjected to an
entire planet of people like you?</i>

1560
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:51,686
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1561
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:54,114
Who put you in charge, huh?

1562
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:56,425
Who are you to
criticize anyone?

1563
01:30:56,685 --> 01:30:58,892
Now, you might think
Gary's a bit of a cock,

1564
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:02,798
and he is a bit of a cock,
but he's my cock.

1565
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:04,358
Oh, thanks, man.

1566
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:09,063
<i>But he is a detriment to himself, just
as Earth is a detriment to the galaxy.</i>

1567
01:31:09,064 --> 01:31:10,197
What did you say?

1568
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:14,169
<i>You act out the same cycles of
self-destruction again and again.</i>

1569
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:19,241
<i>At this point your planet is the least
civilized in the entire galaxy.</i>

1570
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:22,250
What did he say? He's saying
we're a bunch of fuck-ups.

1571
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:25,980
Hey, it's our basic human
right to be fuck-ups.

1572
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:30,154
This civilization was founded on fuck-ups.
And you know what?

1573
01:31:30,285 --> 01:31:32,753
That makes me proud.
And me!

1574
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:35,530
What is it they say?
"To err is..."

1575
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:37,157
"To err is human."

1576
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:40,696
"To err is human," so, uh...

1577
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:44,631
<i>We do not believe you
speak for all humanity.</i>

1578
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:47,768
<i>You are but two men.
Two drunk men.</i>

1579
01:31:47,769 --> 01:31:49,442
Three drunk men!

1580
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:52,506
Stevie-baby!

1581
01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:57,923
<i>Enough! Enough, humans!</i>

1582
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:03,450
Oh, you are in trouble now. It's
only the fucking Three Musketeers.

1583
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:07,388
<i>You are revolting against the
wisdom of countless solar systems.</i>

1584
01:32:07,389 --> 01:32:08,834
Yeah, we are revolting!

1585
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:12,630
You just said you're not here to conquer.
Can I just ask,

1586
01:32:12,794 --> 01:32:15,638
how many people did you have
to replace in Newton Haven?

1587
01:32:15,797 --> 01:32:17,470
<i>That is irrelevant.</i>
Is it?

1588
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:21,880
Hands up.
Who here is human?

1589
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:24,907
I'm human.
One!

1590
01:32:25,907 --> 01:32:27,682
And me.
That's two.

1591
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:30,277
I am. But don't
know for how long.

1592
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:31,845
Basil!
Shh...

1593
01:32:31,846 --> 01:32:35,649
So what's that? Three?
You had to replace an entire town?

1594
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:36,950
<i>Not the entire town.</i>

1595
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:40,320
Everybody apart from old
Nutbowl and the Shifty twins.

1596
01:32:40,321 --> 01:32:42,356
That's a good name for a band, Gary.
You should write that down.

1597
01:32:42,357 --> 01:32:44,425
I will. What about the
ones you replaced,

1598
01:32:44,426 --> 01:32:45,959
like Peter and Oliver?

1599
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,328
Yeah, what happened
to the empties?

1600
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,240
I told you not to ask that!

1601
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:53,902
<i>Redundant vessels are recycled, mulched
and converted into fertilizer,</i>

1602
01:32:54,002 --> 01:32:57,471
<i>whereupon they are returned to the
earth to promote verdancy and growth.</i>

1603
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:00,207
<i>It is a highly efficient
means of organic renewal.</i>

1604
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:01,508
Mulched?

1605
01:33:01,509 --> 01:33:03,911
<i>It is a relative few in light
of our long-term plan.</i>

1606
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:07,247
You mean a few hundred thousand
turned to fucking compost?

1607
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,583
What about the other places?
The penetration points.

1608
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:12,686
Are they as successful
as Newton Haven?

1609
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:15,689
Because I'm guessing we're not
the only glitch in your system.

1610
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:19,160
<i>It is true, The Network has been
experiencing some difficulties.</i>

1611
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:22,763
I think you bit off more than
you can chew with Earth, mate.

1612
01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:25,040
Yeah, 'cause we are more
belligerent, more stubborn

1613
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:27,468
and more idiotic
than you can possibly imagine,

1614
01:33:27,469 --> 01:33:29,436
and I am not just
talking about Gary.

1615
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,105
Yeah, there's more
than one Gary King.

1616
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:34,053
<i>But you said...</i>
I fucking know what I fucking said!

1617
01:33:34,209 --> 01:33:38,345
<i>Your reliance on profanity is a measure of
your immaturity as a man and a species,</i>

1618
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:42,590
Why don't you just get in your rocket and
fuck off back to Legoland, you cunts!

1619
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:46,520
Yeah! Stop fucking
Starbucking us, man! Yeah!

1620
01:33:46,521 --> 01:33:48,288
<i>It is our duty
to challenge you.</i>

1621
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:51,125
Just leave us to our own devices,
you intergalactic arseholes.

1622
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:52,726
<i>You misunderstand.</i>
Shut up!

1623
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:54,595
<i>We are trying...</i>
Nobody's listening!

1624
01:33:54,596 --> 01:33:55,662
<i>If you'd only...</i>

1625
01:33:55,663 --> 01:34:00,874
Face it, we are the human race and
we don't like being told what to do.

1626
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:05,309
<i>Just what is it
that you want to do?</i>

1627
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:08,408
We want to be free!
Yeah.

1628
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:10,511
We want to be free to
do what we want to do!

1629
01:34:10,512 --> 01:34:11,513
Yeah.

1630
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:13,280
We want to get loaded.
Yeah.

1631
01:34:13,281 --> 01:34:15,249
And we want to
have a good time.

1632
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:17,526
And that's what
we're going to do.

1633
01:34:18,553 --> 01:34:21,088
<i>It is pointless
arguing with you.</i>

1634
01:34:21,089 --> 01:34:24,127
<i>You will be left to
your own devices.</i>

1635
01:34:24,292 --> 01:34:25,862
Really?

1636
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:27,064
<i>Yeah.</i>

1637
01:34:27,762 --> 01:34:28,763
<i>Fuck if.</i>

1638
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:41,079
They fucked off.

1639
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:49,295
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Up yours! Up yours! Up yours!

1640
01:34:49,584 --> 01:34:53,387
Yeah, we did it!
We won, we won!

1641
01:34:57,225 --> 01:34:59,136
Gary, let's Boo-Boo.

1642
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:04,433
Yeah, it's shit here, innit?

1643
01:35:07,135 --> 01:35:09,445
Oi, up here!

1644
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:10,872
Go!

1645
01:35:14,075 --> 01:35:15,076
Get up.

1646
01:35:15,577 --> 01:35:16,555
Come on!

1647
01:35:32,794 --> 01:35:34,432
Well done.

1648
01:35:34,629 --> 01:35:37,064
Thanks a bunch. Had to go
and spoil it, didn't you?

1649
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:39,011
Yeah, happy now?

1650
01:35:39,834 --> 01:35:41,404
Basil, what do we do now?

1651
01:35:41,836 --> 01:35:43,570
Same as before.

1652
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,380
Go!

1653
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:50,849
Where's The Beast?

1654
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:53,447
The Beast is dead, mate.

1655
01:35:53,448 --> 01:35:56,783
You know what... You know
what's really annoying?

1656
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:57,851
What?

1657
01:35:57,852 --> 01:36:00,526
I promised myself I
wouldn't die in this town.

1658
01:36:02,357 --> 01:36:03,995
You're not gonna.

1659
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:07,160
I think our luck just changed.

1660
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:08,765
Whoo-hoo!

1661
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:11,509
Oh!

1662
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,000
Sorry!

1663
01:36:13,001 --> 01:36:15,003
Sam?
Yes.

1664
01:36:15,136 --> 01:36:16,436
You came back for us!

1665
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:19,281
Yes, I did. Well, I got lost
on the ring road. But, yes.

1666
01:36:19,507 --> 01:36:23,243
Hi, Sam, could you give us
a lift to London, please?

1667
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:25,112
Did you find out what
happened to my brother?

1668
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:26,153
We'll tell you on the way.

1669
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:30,517
Sorry about the mess. I've
been meaning 10 clear that up.

1670
01:36:30,518 --> 01:36:32,725
We forgive you. Let's go.
Which way?

1671
01:36:33,588 --> 01:36:34,589
Backwards!

1672
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:57,453
Which way now?

1673
01:36:58,146 --> 01:36:59,386
Go straight over!

1674
01:37:17,765 --> 01:37:19,244
We can make it.

1675
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:22,739
We're gonna make it.

1676
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:31,754
We made it!

1677
01:38:32,306 --> 01:38:33,808
I'm sorry.

1678
01:38:37,478 --> 01:38:38,718
I know.

1679
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:41,887
I know.

1680
01:38:42,316 --> 01:38:43,850
<i>Everyone remembers
where they were</i>

1681
01:38:43,851 --> 01:38:46,024
<i>when the lights went out
on Planet Earth.</i>

1682
01:38:46,154 --> 01:38:50,432
<i>Me, Gary, Steven and Sam, we were
standing right by the switch.</i>

1683
01:38:51,559 --> 01:38:54,403
<i>I guess it was
a big night for everyone.</i>

1684
01:38:55,029 --> 01:38:58,272
That morning gave a whole new
meaning to the word "hangover".

1685
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:03,638
We decided to walk it off,
all the way back to London,

1686
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:08,146
but the headache didn't end there.
It just went on and on.

1687
01:39:09,877 --> 01:39:11,515
Talk about the Big Smoke.

1688
01:39:13,214 --> 01:39:18,129
When The Network went down, it
triggered some kind of pulse,

1689
01:39:19,854 --> 01:39:21,765
wiped out all our technology

1690
01:39:23,724 --> 01:39:25,362
and sent us here,

1691
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,198
back to the Dark Ages.

1692
01:39:30,398 --> 01:39:33,572
There were casualties, of course.
I knew a few of them.

1693
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:37,847
Some guy from work, my
cousin Paul, Gary's mum.

1694
01:39:40,842 --> 01:39:43,243
Nobody really knew
how many we lost,

1695
01:39:43,244 --> 01:39:45,912
because we never heard from
the rest of the world again.

1696
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:47,654
<i>Everyone got cut off.</i>

1697
01:39:48,616 --> 01:39:51,256
<i>It isn't easy now,
but it is simpler.</i>

1698
01:39:51,786 --> 01:39:54,254
<i>I'm back with the wife,
which is something.</i>

1699
01:39:54,255 --> 01:39:58,291
<i>We decided our problems didn't seem
as bad in the grand scheme of things,</i>

1700
01:39:58,292 --> 01:40:02,229
<i>We all had to go organic in a
big way, but if I'm honest,</i>

1701
01:40:02,230 --> 01:40:05,837
<i>I'm hard pressed to recall any
processed foods I actually miss.</i>

1702
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:13,149
As for the blanks, well, a
funny thing happened there.

1703
01:40:14,075 --> 01:40:15,554
They woke up.

1704
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:20,086
<i>A week or so after The Network pulled out,
they just sort of rebooted by themselves,</i>

1705
01:40:21,082 --> 01:40:22,755
<i>tried to start afresh.</i>

1706
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:28,323
<i>They seemed lost at first, children
cut off from their parents,</i>

1707
01:40:28,990 --> 01:40:33,666
<i>abandoned, forgotten, looking for guidance,
for someone to show them the way.</i>

1708
01:40:34,829 --> 01:40:36,809
<i>I felt a bit sorry for them,
to be honest.</i>

1709
01:40:38,566 --> 01:40:40,400
<i>The Network was right
about one thing.</i>

1710
01:40:40,401 --> 01:40:42,779
<i>We can be a bit uncivilized.</i>

1711
01:40:43,437 --> 01:40:47,112
<i>Maybe we would've been a bad
influence on the rest of the galaxy.</i>

1712
01:40:47,975 --> 01:40:50,810
<i>Oliver went back to
being an estate agent.</i>

1713
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:53,113
<i>People still need a roof
over their heads,</i>

1714
01:40:53,114 --> 01:40:55,492
<i>and the old Ollie always
had a gift for the gab.</i>

1715
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:58,785
<i>I guess the new one has, too.</i>

1716
01:40:58,786 --> 01:41:00,493
<i>He's doing all right.</i>

1717
01:41:01,455 --> 01:41:04,026
<i>I hear that the Peter found his
way home to Bishop's Gardens.</i>

1718
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:08,170
<i>I suppose he picked up
where the other one left off.</i>

1719
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:11,473
<i>I'm not sure his wife noticed.</i>

1720
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:16,077
<i>Maybe she chose not to. He's a
pretty good dad by all accounts.</i>

1721
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:21,074
<i>Steven and Sam got
together in the end.</i>

1722
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:23,043
<i>Didn't see that coming.</i>

1723
01:41:23,044 --> 01:41:25,312
<i>They shacked up
just outside London.</i>

1724
01:41:25,313 --> 01:41:27,589
<i>It's a pretty nice shack, too.</i>

1725
01:41:28,049 --> 01:41:31,155
As for Gary? I don't know
what happened to Gary.

1726
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:35,301
We got separated and
I never saw him again.

1727
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:39,860
Some say he went back to Newton Haven.
I don't know why.

1728
01:41:40,628 --> 01:41:42,630
I think his business
there was done.

1729
01:41:43,831 --> 01:41:46,675
<i>It's funny, but I miss him.</i>

1730
01:41:47,668 --> 01:41:51,514
<i>I wonder if he misses me.
Misses the boys.</i>

1731
01:41:58,212 --> 01:42:00,692
<i>Wherever he is,
I hope he's happy.</i>

1732
01:42:01,048 --> 01:42:03,083
<i>That's all he ever wanted,
really.</i>

1733
01:42:03,084 --> 01:42:04,722
<i>To have a good time.</i>

1734
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:08,391
<i>I just hope he found it
beyond the bottom of a glass.</i>

1735
01:42:09,557 --> 01:42:14,267
<i>Because real happiness, real friends,
those are things worth living for,</i>

1736
01:42:15,997 --> 01:42:17,670
<i>worth fighting for.</i>

1737
01:42:29,877 --> 01:42:31,254
Blank bastards.

1738
01:42:34,715 --> 01:42:36,388
Fucking robots.

1739
01:42:45,493 --> 01:42:47,063
Five waters, please.

1740
01:42:49,397 --> 01:42:50,899
You can have one.

1741
01:42:51,766 --> 01:42:53,667
But I ain't serving this scum.

1742
01:42:53,668 --> 01:42:56,706
Well, I'm afraid it's all
for one and one for all.

1743
01:42:56,904 --> 01:42:59,272
You see, my young friends
and I are on an adventure.

1744
01:42:59,273 --> 01:43:02,942
A quest, if you will. And since we
find ourselves in need of refreshment,

1745
01:43:02,943 --> 01:43:05,651
you, sir, have the honor
of drawing first blood.

1746
01:43:06,814 --> 01:43:08,885
So, I'll ask you again,

1747
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:10,762
for the last time,

1748
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:15,191
five waters, please.

1749
01:43:23,597 --> 01:43:26,043
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1750
01:43:26,434 --> 01:43:30,280
Me? They call me The King.

1750
01:43:31,305 --> 01:44:31,303
