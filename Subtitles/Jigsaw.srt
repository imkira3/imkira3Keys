1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,439
Go, go, go, go, go!

3
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,518
Suspect on foot, entering warehouse.
In pursuit.

4
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,676
Go, go!

5
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,552
Freeze! Stop right there!
Put down the weapon!

6
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,955
Can't stop it now.

7
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,077
- Nothing can stop it.
- On the ground!

8
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,197
On the ground. Drop it, right now!

9
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,999
Halloran! Detective Halloran!

10
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,358
If he's not here in 17 minutes,
five people are gonna die.

11
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,074
Get Halloran here, now!

12
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,160
Where the fuck is Halloran?

13
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,560
People are gonna die, man!

14
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,956
- Doesn't he know?
- All of you, get back.

15
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,679
- Halloran!
- Edgar!

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,512
Edgar, what the fuck are you doing?

17
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,872
- You put down that remote.
- I can't.

18
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,031
- What's that for?
- The games are just getting started.

19
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,715
- What game?
- His games, his rules.

20
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,190
I gotta choose who dies. Them or me.

21
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,000
Edgar, I don't want to shoot you, but I will.

22
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,991
Drop the remote.

23
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,470
- I got him, should I take it?
- No, no, no. Target the remote.

24
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,517
If he moves to trigger it, blow it to shit.

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,795
Running out of time!

26
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,317
- Who else is there?
- Edgar! Tell us what's going on!

27
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,359
- Who's controlling you?
- I'm not fucking dying.

28
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,639
Which one of you assholes
shot him in the chest?

29
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,310
The game.

30
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,113
It's started...

31
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,795
What is this?

32
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,672
- What the hell?
- What the fuck?

33
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,269
Yo, what the hell?

34
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,799
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, God.

35
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,829
What's going on?

36
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,160
No, no, no, no.

37
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,200
Help me!

38
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,509
No, no, no.

39
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,397
- Help!
- Somebody please help me.

40
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,675
Please, help me!

41
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,280
Help! Help!

42
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
Please, help me!

43
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,554
Just stay the fuck back!

44
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,800
<i>I'm sure you're all
wondering why you're here.</i>

45
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,558
<i>You deny culpability, no doubt,
for the circumstances</i>

46
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,360
<i>in which you find yourselves.</i>

47
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,036
<i>Salvation can be yours,
if you cleanse yourselves</i>

48
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,631
<i>of the habitual lies
which have brought you here.</i>

49
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,189
<i>Lies that you have told yourselves.</i>

50
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,795
<i>Lies that have brutalized others.</i>

51
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,557
<i>Confess. The truth will set you free.</i>

52
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,839
<i>But any attempt to violate
my rules will kill you.</i>

53
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,675
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

54
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,830
Fuck you!

55
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,880
<i>First, an offering of blood,
no matter how little,</i>

56
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,270
<i>will give you a green light</i>

57
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,194
<i>to escape from this room with your lives.</i>

58
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,595
<i>If you can release yourself from your demons,</i>

59
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,990
<i>you can begin to shed the chains</i>

60
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,799
<i>that those demons bring with them.</i>

61
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,677
<i>Make the simple blood sacrifice
that I've requested</i>

62
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,831
<i>or face severe consequences.</i>

63
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,154
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

64
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,040
The fuck's going on over here?

65
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,272
- No, no, no...
- No, no, no!

66
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,919
No!

67
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,358
No! No!

68
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,353
What do we do? What do we do?

69
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,439
Someone do something!

70
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,912
Hey! Wake up!

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,229
Wake up!

72
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,790
Stop!

73
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,316
"An offering of blood."

74
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,353
"No matter how little."

75
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,995
"An offering of blood."

76
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,154
"An offering of blood."

77
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,629
"An offering of blood."

78
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,313
Cut yourself! You need to cut yourself!

79
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,278
He wants blood, and then you're free!

80
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,310
Cut yourself, he wants blood!

81
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,720
Cut yourself!

82
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,555
Fuck!

83
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,560
Come on, come on, come on.

84
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,673
Yes! Holy shit!

85
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,759
You need to cut yourself!

86
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,479
- Get off me!
- You need to cut yourself!

87
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,797
What the...

88
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,470
No.

89
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,473
Cut yourself! You need to cut yourself!

90
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,472
Cut yourself!

91
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,474
Where the fuck are we?

92
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,593
He hit the remote, but nothing triggered.

93
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,316
As far as we know.

94
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,310
You think the game's real?

95
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,710
Don't know.

96
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,594
Why do you think he asked for you?

97
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,030
We're good friends.

98
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,669
I put him away twice.

99
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,996
Edgar Munsen is a sociopathic meth head.

100
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,549
Been in and out of prison
for assault and battery,

101
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,717
armed robbery, drug dealing.

102
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,030
Nice guy.

103
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,240
Doc, we need him awake. We've got questions.

104
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,310
Sorry, Detective.

105
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,272
The bullet's lodged against the heart.

106
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,756
I've got him in a barbiturate-induced coma
until he stabilizes.

107
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,715
- How long?
- Swelling has to come down first.

108
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,598
Two hours. Two weeks. Can't tell you.

109
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,190
Excuse me.

110
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,318
Start the suspect list
with Munsen's known associates.

111
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,393
This is not gonna end well.

112
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,590
Hungry?

113
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,110
Help!

114
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,238
Please, somebody help us!

115
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,792
Help!

116
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,598
Please! Don't...

117
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,636
Stay still.

118
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,199
What do you want with us?

119
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,750
That voice...

120
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,031
It said salvation can be ours
if we cleanse our soul of our lies.

121
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,430
Is this some kind of fucked up confessional?

122
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,240
The truth will set us free.

123
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,233
Honey, my soul is clean.

124
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,396
It's Anna.

125
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,760
And bullshit.

126
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,110
I'm Mitch.

127
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,070
What's your name?

128
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,556
Carly.

129
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,790
Don't touch me!

130
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,791
This is some bastard's sick idea of a joke?

131
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,558
He said it was a game.

132
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,351
Well, then I hope, for all of our sakes,
that it is a game.

133
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,114
Oh, yeah? Why is that, sweetheart?

134
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,593
Because games can be won.

135
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,750
This is crazy.

136
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,831
- What the hell?
- Did anyone phone the police?

137
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,149
Yeah.

138
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,270
Underhand!

139
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,392
- Whoa!
- Overhand!

140
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,073
Okay, you got some heat on it!

141
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,551
Cell phone's off for a reason, Halloran.

142
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,955
Well, what do you think, El?

143
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,596
I don't know. He looks a little "pail."

144
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,751
Let's get this thing off.

145
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,514
- Ooh.
- Ah.

146
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,750
Hmm.

147
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,750
Hm!

148
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,480
Someone's been studying up on John Kramer.

149
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,555
Copycat?

150
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,396
Hope not. Kramer's been dead for ten years.

151
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,350
- Keith!
- What's up, Doc?

152
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,794
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- I'm good.

153
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,200
- Good to see you.
- You too, man.

154
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,318
- You're working this neighborhood now?
- Uh, yeah, I joined homicide last month.

155
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,550
Jesus. What happened to this guy?

156
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,520
You two know each other?

157
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,160
- Logan was our medic in Fallujah.
- Mm.

158
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,439
Hey, uh, I'm sorry to hear about Christine.

159
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,715
How you been, man?

160
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,958
Uh, good, Keith.

161
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,713
Yeah, I'm doing well.

162
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,711
All right.

163
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,080
Eleanor.

164
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,756
What is it?

165
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,109
Okay, then.

166
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,760
"And then there were four..."

167
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,279
You got a computer we could stick that in?

168
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,111
<i>The games have begun again.</i>

169
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,351
<i>And they will not stop</i>

170
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,229
<i>until the sins against
the innocent are atoned for.</i>

171
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,032
<i>I will take care of the next four.
You take care of the rest.</i>

172
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,520
We gotta get that to voice rec.

173
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,475
It's not him.

174
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,390
Can't be.

175
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,550
Right?

176
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,516
Aw, shit.

177
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,874
What the fuck?

178
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,990
What the fuck?

179
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,113
No, that's not creepy at all.

180
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,039
No. No!

181
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,474
No, no, no...

182
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,550
Ah, shit!

183
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,955
Help!

184
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,553
Somebody please help us!

185
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,994
Where is this sick fuck taking us?

186
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,719
Did anyone see anything?

187
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,759
No, nothing. I got fucking drugged!

188
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,912
He said, "Confess"! We have to confess!

189
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,595
Yeah, you got something you wanna confess?
Have at it. Come on!

190
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,599
Man, we all have something to confess!

191
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,079
I sold a kid a bike once.

192
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,280
<i>He had an accident ten minutes
after I sold it to him.</i>

193
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,640
It's not my fault he couldn't handle
such a powerful damn bike, all right?

194
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,319
- He died!
- That's it?

195
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,073
That's all you did?
You sold a kid a bike he died on?

196
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,913
- Come on, man!
- That's it! I said that's it, man!

197
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,231
Yeah, bullshit.
What about you, sweetheart? Come on!

198
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,600
We lost our baby.

199
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,912
Anna... Anna.

200
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,480
Tell me that this isn't happening.

201
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,353
My husband made a mistake.

202
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,996
No, no, no. That's not a confession,
come on, come on!

203
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,515
I don't know what the fuck
you want me to say, okay?

204
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,239
I let our marriage fall apart.

205
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,357
No, no. A confession is,
"I killed a hooker in Tulsa,"

206
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,671
or, "I ate my fucking neighbor."
Not, "I need marriage counseling."

207
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,878
- Carly?
- No, nothing I can think of!

208
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,959
- Yeah, well, think faster!
- You think faster!

209
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,830
Oh, my God.

210
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,676
We're gonna hang.

211
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,714
Play the damn tape, Mitch.

212
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,954
Oh, God!

213
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,233
<i>While I am certain that there is a desire</i>

214
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,677
<i>to point fingers at me
for the blood that has been shed,</i>

215
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,190
<i>unless you turn that finger inward,</i>

216
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,951
<i>I assure you, more blood will be lost</i>

217
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,271
<i>and all will be judged.</i>

218
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,190
<i>We will begin with one.</i>

219
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,272
<i>One who is not only a liar,</i>

220
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,999
- <i>but a thief.</i>
- Hey!

221
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,196
<i>A purse-snatcher.</i>

222
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,476
<i>And when you had a chance
to fix the harm that you'd done,</i>

223
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,913
<i>you chose to do nothing.</i>

224
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,599
<i>Now it is you who could die
without the right medication.</i>

225
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,717
<i>While unconscious, this deceiver among you,</i>

226
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,918
<i>this criminal, was injected with a poison.</i>

227
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,040
<i>One of the syringes in front of you
holds the antidote.</i>

228
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,680
<i>One is a saline solution.</i>

229
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,113
<i>The other, an acid that will cause
an excruciating death.</i>

230
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,235
<i>Inject the correct one
and your chains will be released.</i>

231
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,360
<i>Failure to make the right choice</i>

232
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,552
<i>could result in death for you all.</i>

233
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,236
<i>I ask you, what is a life worth to you?</i>

234
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,758
One of you 'fess up, or we all die.

235
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,674
- Okay, check yourself for marks.
- Huh?

236
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,513
If he injected us, there could be marks.

237
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,796
Bingo.

238
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,873
- What are you doing?
- It's okay. It's okay.

239
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,118
You just gotta pick a needle, blondie.

240
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,512
Look, we get out of these things
when you pick an antidote.

241
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,193
Or else we all die, Carly!

242
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,078
No. What if it's the acid?

243
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,558
- I won't.
- Bullshit, you won't.

244
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,357
Maybe just confess, Carly.

245
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,840
Okay, did you steal purses?

246
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,873
Yeah, years ago, but...

247
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,350
- I didn't kill anyone!
- No, no, no!

248
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,000
No, that's not the repentant attitude
this guy's looking for, okay?

249
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,639
You're lying! You're lying!

250
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,995
No! I was broke, okay?

251
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,950
And yes, somebody died,
but it wasn't my fault.

252
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,838
Okay. Choose.

253
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,513
- Or I'm gonna stick them all into you!
- No!

254
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,239
- Yo, man!
- Are you kidding me?

255
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,118
- Stop!
- Just let her look!

256
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,157
Do any of these numbers mean anything to you?

257
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,677
- Choose now!
- I'm trying!

258
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,118
Three dollars and 53 cents.

259
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,793
What? What does that mean?

260
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,516
- What?
- What a life is worth to me.

261
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,880
Oh, fuck.

262
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,400
Choose, right now! Come on, pick!

263
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,915
- Pick one! Pick now! Please!
- I can't do it!

264
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,912
- Pick one now!
- We're all going to die!

265
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,832
- Come on.
- Pick now! Choose!

266
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,716
Come on, Carly!

267
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,519
I'm not gonna fucking do it!
No, I'm not going to!

268
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,512
- Fuck you! I won't do it.
- Pick one, now!

269
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,878
Come on, pick! Pick!

270
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,596
Fuck! I'm not gonna pick!

271
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,639
- Come on!
- Now! Now, Carly, now!

272
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,415
Pick now!

273
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,234
Pick one!

274
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,990
Pick one!

275
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,599
- Fucking asshole!
- Hey! Hey!

276
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,434
I'm not the one who put us here.
Get a hold of yourself.

277
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,236
I just saved our lives.

278
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,789
Yeah, but you took hers. You killed her.

279
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,398
- You selfish son of a bitch!
- Stop! Both y'all need to chill!

280
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,631
What the hell?

281
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,991
"A life is worth $3.53."

282
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,751
- What?
- That's what she said.

283
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,430
Yeah.

284
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,120
Yeah. Three dollars and 53 cents.

285
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,913
There's more numbers on the inside of this.

286
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,120
It could be the combination.

287
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,359
Dental IDs Buckethead as Malcolm Neale.

288
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,831
Malcolm Neale? I remember that case.

289
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,038
His wife was murdered five years ago.

290
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,191
A home invasion. Perp slit her throat.

291
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,476
- He made him watch.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I remember.

292
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,559
Malcolm Neale was a, uh, degenerate gambler.

293
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,109
Wife's murder was on him.
He owed some bad guys some money.

294
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,669
And did you ever get around
to convicting those bad guys?

295
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,040
Scratch marks from fingernails.

296
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,635
There was a struggle,
presumably with the killer.

297
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,713
The partial decapitation
was made by a circular saw.

298
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,671
There are traces of ferric oxide,
hematite, in the wound.

299
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,157
- Rust from blades.
- Okay.

300
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,153
What about the voice recording?
Anything off the flash drive?

301
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,516
The voice was John Kramer. Matched.

302
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,239
- Identical.
- Matched?

303
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,392
- What, he came back from the dead?
- Wouldn't be his first time.

304
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,079
Just because someone is dead
doesn't mean they can't have a voice.

305
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,595
Give us enough time, we speak for the dead.

306
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,233
On the roof, Edgar Munsen was
spouting off about starting a game.

307
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,154
The recording says there are
four more potential victims.

308
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,552
Four people fighting for their lives.

309
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,390
God...

310
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,432
Okay, we're in the countryside somewhere.

311
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,311
I can't make out any landmarks, nothing.

312
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,199
Oh, God. Who's doing this to us?

313
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,831
I have no idea.

314
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,515
What's your name?

315
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,757
Ryan.

316
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,040
And what's your sin, Ryan?

317
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,395
Sold bad mortgages, sold good coke,

318
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,676
cheated on my taxes, cheated on my wife.

319
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,590
Both of them.

320
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,956
So, you know...

321
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,631
Nothing that bad.

322
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,750
What's your story, lollipop?

323
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,429
It was my husband's fault.

324
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,954
Oh, come on. Bullshit.

325
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,795
Why... Why am I being punished
for something that he did?

326
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,550
Huh?

327
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,153
If he hadn't fallen asleep,

328
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,197
he wouldn't have rolled over
and suffocated our baby.

329
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,640
It's not my fault.

330
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,719
No, no. No!

331
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,996
For real, you don't think
he's trying to tell us something?

332
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,311
Look, there are two perfectly
good doors right here.

333
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,438
Right, so we go through the door
that leads exactly he wants us to go?

334
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,840
- No, thanks.
- No, Mitch is right.

335
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,435
- I don't think this is...
- Back the fuck up.

336
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,113
Man, get that shit out of my face.

337
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,150
Oh, my God!

338
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,392
Help me! Help. Please. Ah! What the fuck?

339
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,272
There's wires, there's something...

340
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,958
Help! Help!

341
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,552
See? See?

342
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,109
Looks like there's a bunch
of wires wrapped around his leg...

343
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,714
and around some pulleys.

344
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,714
Okay, there's, uh...
there's some kind of handle.

345
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,270
Guys, there's a tape.

346
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,913
It's tighter! It just got tighter!

347
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,229
- Oh, God!
- Okay.

348
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,074
- Oh, God! Oh!
- Okay, how do we get the tape?

349
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,072
- Go slow.
- Oh, yeah. Be careful.

350
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,231
- Really slow.
- Yeah, okay. Careful.

351
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,879
Careful. Careful. Careful.

352
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,633
Oh, please be careful.

353
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,949
Oh, God.

354
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,991
Careful, careful, careful...

355
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,477
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, my God!

356
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,359
Oh, my... You guys aren't helping!

357
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,111
Grab the tape! Grab the tape.

358
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,431
No way, man.
No, you gotta fucking grab the tape.

359
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,399
I saved your fucking life, Mitch!
Grab the tape!

360
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,636
- Just do it!
- Please.

361
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,832
Please, yeah. Yeah, come on.

362
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,637
Come on. Come on, man.

363
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,756
Oh, my God.

364
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,276
- You almost got it?
- I'm trying, dude!

365
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,589
You got it. You got it.

366
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,558
Okay. All good, all good. You got it?

367
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,472
Oh, God, oh, good.

368
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,196
You got it?

369
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,555
Play the tape, Mitch. Play the tape.

370
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,470
No, you play the tape, man.

371
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,232
<i>There are no shortcuts in life.</i>

372
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,400
<i>Please forgive the rather crude example</i>

373
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,394
<i>I will make of your decision
to not follow the rules.</i>

374
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,794
<i>Pull the handle and you will be set free.</i>

375
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,392
What does he mean "set free"?

376
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,154
Good luck, lollipop.

377
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,997
Oh, God.

378
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,351
Hey.

379
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,513
Prelim report on Buckethead.

380
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,839
It says the particles found
on the body are animal feces.

381
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,513
Cow, chicken, pig...

382
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,797
They also found traces of Aujeszky's disease.

383
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,155
Aujeszky's disease?

384
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,516
It's a virus.

385
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,557
Mostly known because, when swine get it,

386
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,472
farmers have to wipe out the entire sounder.

387
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,996
I'm impressed.

388
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,391
Keep digging.

389
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,632
Maybe I can track the virus to a location.

390
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,076
Dr. Nelson, another one, possible jumper.

391
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,560
Any identification on the victim?

392
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,556
No. Looks like the same killer.

393
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,075
This was on the body.

394
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,277
No link so far to any of our suspects.

395
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,154
- Is it Kramer? Do you know?
- Is this crime related to Jigsaw?

396
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,118
Think it's any coincidence that
Edgar Munsen happens to be a guest here?

397
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,920
I think it's highly unlikely
he woke up from a coma,

398
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,959
climbed on a roof, and threw a girl off.

399
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,074
But I did check with the ICU.
He's still there.

400
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,954
Looks like acid.

401
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,551
There's a depletion of adenosine triphosphate

402
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,757
in the muscle fibers. Rigor mortis.

403
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,953
Clearly, she didn't die from the fall.

404
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,874
It's hydrofluoric acid.

405
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,355
Look, here. This is the injection point.

406
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,514
The vein carried it all the way
to the heart, where it's singed.

407
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,353
How do you know it was hydrofluoric acid?

408
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,638
Saw a lot of it in Fallujah.

409
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,273
Never injected, though.

410
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,354
A puzzle piece.

411
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,999
Jig-fucking-saw!

412
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,912
What's Logan's deal?
What happened in Fallujah?

413
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,798
Uh, he, uh...

414
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,432
- He got captured.
- Oh.

415
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,557
But not before taking out three Taliban.

416
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,276
Well from what I heard,
they tortured the shit out of him.

417
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,235
He spent months in the VA hospital
when he got back.

418
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,950
Think he snapped?

419
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,273
Come on, man, you're talking about a brother.

420
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,158
I got a brother. He's a fucking asshole.

421
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,232
What do you think about his second, Eleanor?

422
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,956
She's got a great ass, big mouth.

423
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,157
- Seems to get off on this sick shit.
- Yeah.

424
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,240
Motherfucker!

425
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,830
Shit. What the fuck?

426
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,355
Oh, fuck.

427
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,315
I'm a good person.

428
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,913
I'm a good person, I don't deserve this.

429
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,590
I confess...

430
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,273
I confess. I con...

431
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,676
I confess that this is fucked up!

432
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,110
What?

433
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,910
Hey, guys.

434
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,310
Hey, guys!

435
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,120
Somebody turned on the TV.

436
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,716
Hello?

437
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,280
Yeah, we got one, too.

438
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,272
- I'm gonna have to lift you.
- What?

439
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,240
We gotta get the remote.

440
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,760
Okay, fine.

441
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,950
Got it?

442
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,916
Got it!

443
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,879
No! No!

444
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,430
No!

445
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,157
<i>In the past, you have all
put your own interests above others,</i>

446
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,471
<i>and then lied to yourselves,</i>

447
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,200
<i>and deceived the world
about your callousness,</i>

448
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,840
<i>your larceny, your criminality.</i>

449
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,237
<i>Now, you will look in the mirror</i>

450
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,040
<i>and you will face who you really are.</i>

451
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,390
<i>The choices you have made
may cost you your life.</i>

452
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,997
<i>You cannot escape the truth.</i>

453
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,232
<i>There is, however,
one person who can help you.</i>

454
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,110
<i>Ryan.</i>

455
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,078
<i>If he pulls the lever
before you are buried alive...</i>

456
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,995
<i>...you will live.</i>

457
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,080
<i>Ryan, free yourself to free them.</i>

458
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,310
Ryan.

459
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,709
<i>Ryan?</i>

460
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,555
No! No!

461
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,469
- What is that?
- <i>It's grain!</i>

462
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,919
- Ryan, man, we're gonna get buried alive!
- Ryan!

463
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,830
Ryan!

464
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,030
<i>Ryan!</i>

465
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,599
- Get to the handle!
- Ryan!

466
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,319
- I can't!
- <i>Ryan!</i>

467
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,720
<i>Please, Ryan!</i>

468
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,914
Hurry, man!

469
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,400
Ryan!

470
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,234
You have to do it!

471
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,470
Oh, God!

472
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,595
<i>Get to the handle!</i>

473
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,717
<i>Ryan, pull the fucking handle!</i>

474
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,069
<i>Please!</i>

475
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,275
What's your story, sweetheart?

476
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,229
What are you asking, Detective?

477
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,756
You one of those, uh, kinky types?

478
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,636
Like a little pain?

479
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,996
Why?

480
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,550
You wanna get punished?

481
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,950
Too late.

482
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,511
Already got an ex-wife
that tortures me every day.

483
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,193
- Maybe you deserve it.
- Probably.

484
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,760
Where were you the night
Malcolm Neale got murdered?

485
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,710
Home.

486
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,319
- Alone.
- Cool.

487
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,077
Oh. Can you prove that?

488
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,475
Do I need to?

489
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,314
- <i>Come home soon, Daddy.</i>
- I will. I'm...

490
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,835
I'm sorry you have
to stay so late again, Judy.

491
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,990
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

492
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,358
All right, sleep sweet, Mel.

493
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,950
I love you.

494
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,109
- <i>Love you too, Daddy.</i>
- Love you, bye.

495
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,590
<i>Bye.</i>

496
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,070
Logan.

497
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,790
How did you find Eleanor?

498
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,470
My assistant?

499
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,756
Is that all she is?

500
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,877
It's been two years since
Christine passed. It's just...

501
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,920
- I wouldn't blame you.
- Yes, but I'm a professional.

502
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,789
Uh, Logan, you ever heard
of a website called "Jigsaw Rules"?

503
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,071
No.

504
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,276
Buried deep online.

505
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,114
Took some digging,
but it's a site devoted to Jigsaw.

506
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,157
Half of it's bullshit, posers,
but there's some stuff on there...

507
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,835
...that is really messed up.

508
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,320
A lot of sick fucks.

509
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,511
Okay?

510
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,877
We did a darknet IP trawl.
Got a lot of hits from your assistant.

511
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,710
She's a regular.

512
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,797
Downloaded some shit you cannot imagine.

513
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,676
So you're saying that
Eleanor Bonneville is our copycat?

514
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,274
No, that's not what we're saying.

515
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,830
You check her alibi?

516
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,395
She said she was home the morning

517
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,119
Buckethead was found hanging in the park.

518
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,399
Uh, 7:00 a.m.? Home alone? Single woman?

519
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,195
- That does sound suspicious.
- All right, let's rewind.

520
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,155
How did Eleanor come to you?

521
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,597
She sought out the department
to do her residency.

522
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,397
And after that?
After she finished her residency?

523
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,151
I mean, three months ago,
she was offered a job

524
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,277
running the show
at the Cleveland city morgue.

525
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,714
Why didn't she take that?

526
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,480
Would you want to move to Cleveland?

527
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,832
That's the lab. Results are in.

528
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,478
Okay, so this is the DNA of the blood
scraped from under the fingernails

529
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,358
of the first victim, Malcolm Neale.

530
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,716
Yeah, Buckethead. Can you ID it?

531
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,075
Already did.

532
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,555
This is a blood sample of a perp
taken a decade ago.

533
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,629
You might remember the case.

534
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,834
It's an exact match.

535
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,316
Whose blood is it?

536
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,470
John Kramer.

537
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,471
What?

538
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,754
That's impossible.

539
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,190
That's a fact.

540
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,073
The blood under the fingernails of
our first victim is John Kramer's blood.

541
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,874
The Jigsaw Killer.

542
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,320
Ryan!

543
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,550
<i>Help!</i>

544
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,595
- <i>Ryan!</i>
- <i>Help!</i>

545
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,319
<i>Pull the lever!</i>

546
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,030
Ryan!

547
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,349
Uh...

548
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,830
- Uh...
- <i>Get to the handle!</i>

549
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,912
Help, now!

550
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,995
<i>Ryan!</i>

551
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,196
No!

552
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,794
Go to hell!

553
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,232
You gotta help us now, man!

554
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,874
Help!

555
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,551
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

556
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,910
Ryan!

557
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,232
- <i>Pull the handle, Ryan!</i>
- <i>Ryan!</i>

558
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,310
<i>Pull it!</i>

559
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,195
Ryan!

560
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,239
We're gonna die in here! Please!

561
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,114
<i>For the love of God, just pull it!</i>

562
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,400
If we die, you die!

563
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,592
Oh, God...

564
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,550
Here's the GPS location
on Ms. Bonneville's cell.

565
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,560
Great.

566
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,594
Is Jigsaw dead?

567
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,194
Did Kramer die, or do we have proof?

568
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,954
What do you have to say to all
the panicked citizens who want answers?

569
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,315
Turned your phone off?

570
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,639
And yet here you are, you found me.

571
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,635
You'd make a good detective.

572
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,750
Or maybe I'm just too predictable.

573
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,752
Predictable? No.

574
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,834
Halloran's passing the blame around.

575
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,755
He's looking at us.

576
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,079
Yeah. They're watching my house.

577
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,514
Cause he thinks your alibi is shit.

578
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,478
You really love that guy, huh?

579
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,194
First year at County, clean case.

580
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,994
A predator by the name of Alistair Schultz.

581
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,120
Halloran roughed him up
while he was in custody.

582
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,554
The lawyer used that to get him off.

583
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,712
The very next day,
he kills an eight-year-old girl

584
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,314
who shows up on my table.

585
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,789
The first of many.

586
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,796
Halloran...

587
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,640
can't help himself.

588
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,680
Can't get out of his own way.

589
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,550
So, no, I don't have much love for the guy.

590
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,598
Well, it's a job, Logan.

591
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,869
You can't make it personal.

592
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,953
When you have a little girl one day...

593
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,236
Why didn't you tell me
about the job offer in Cleveland?

594
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,155
- You would've told me to take it.
- Yes. Yes, you're damn right I would.

595
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,153
- It's complicated.
- We are past complicated.

596
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,473
When Buckethead was strung up...

597
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,878
I wasn't at home like I told the cops.

598
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,520
I was at my, uh...

599
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,193
- ...studio.
- What studio?

600
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,429
Why couldn't you tell them that?

601
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,159
Like I said, it's...

602
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,836
It's complicated.

603
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,798
You don't think they're
gonna find out about it?

604
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,430
They know about the Jigsaw fan website,
whatever the fuck you're doing on that.

605
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,000
They're gonna find out about everything.

606
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,270
El, they think I'm involved.

607
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,710
Show me.

608
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,469
- Oh, Jesus!
- Okay...

609
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,631
- I should warn you, because...
- Can you turn the lights on?

610
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,275
Eleanor...

611
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,320
What is this?

612
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,673
Hey, a girl's gotta have a hobby.

613
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,349
A hobby?

614
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,520
Is that what you call it?
How about a stamp collection?

615
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,193
That's a hobby.

616
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,760
It's beautiful, isn't it?

617
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,193
Supposedly, John Kramer designed this trap

618
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,715
for a game that took place
before all the others.

619
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,473
They found the plans in his lab.

620
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,591
I built it myself.

621
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,199
Got them from some guy on the Internet.

622
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,197
Rumor is, not only did John design this...

623
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,473
...he built one.

624
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,432
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint,

625
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,799
but none of Kramer's victims
died in any device like this.

626
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,038
The wounds don't match the design.

627
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,913
Maybe the bodies were never found.

628
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,400
And maybe it never happened.

629
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,480
Maybe someone's playing games with you.

630
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,193
What are you doing with all this stuff?

631
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,439
You need to get rid of it now.

632
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,200
Great work. Now we've got probable cause.

633
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,439
- You're not gonna believe this.
- What?

634
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,957
The commissioner wants
to see Jigsaw's remains.

635
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,679
Wants proof he's really dead.

636
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,080
- What?
- Yeah.

637
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,197
Said he wants to calm the peoples' fears.

638
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,715
Are you serious? Chasing a dead man.

639
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,552
This is election year bullshit.

640
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,117
That is all yours.
I'm gonna follow up on these.

641
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,630
Right on.

642
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,350
Halloran.

643
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,200
He's in a fucking coma,
how does he just disappear?

644
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,790
He's still breathing.

645
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,151
What is it?

646
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,554
It says my name.

647
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,751
You know what happens
if we don't follow the rules.

648
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,400
<i>Hello, Mitch.</i>

649
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,632
<i>You've admitted to
selling a boy a motorcycle.</i>

650
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,631
<i>But you have not told
the entire story, have you?</i>

651
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,839
<i>Six hundred dollars for a bike
that you listed in excellent condition.</i>

652
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,991
<i>Even though you knew the brakes were faulty.</i>

653
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,916
<i>You took his 600 bucks.</i>

654
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,400
<i>And in return, you delivered him to his end.</i>

655
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,316
<i>He was my nephew, and he never hurt anyone.</i>

656
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,833
<i>The device you see here
has a unique power source.</i>

657
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,874
<i>It's the same engine that graced
the bike you sold my nephew.</i>

658
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,795
- Fuck.
- <i>However, I assure you,</i>

659
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,715
<i>the brake lever for this one works perfectly.</i>

660
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,156
- Oh shit.
- Look, you're right, man!

661
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,190
<i>Avoid the dangers around you,
hit the motorcycle brake handle,</i>

662
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,556
- <i>and the motor will stop.</i>
- Oh, shit!

663
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,835
<i>Live or die, Mitch.</i>

664
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,960
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

665
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,676
Shit! No, no, no!

666
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,200
Oh, shit.

667
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,034
Look, I'm sorry! Stop, please!

668
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,552
I'm sorry about your nephew!

669
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,000
Anna, help!

670
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,194
Get the fuck up here!

671
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,073
I don't want to die!

672
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,794
Stop! Stop it!

673
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,830
Stop!

674
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,990
All right.

675
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,232
Anna, you gotta help me!

676
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,830
Hurry up! Hurry, please!

677
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,833
Please help! Hurry! Hurry!

678
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,709
I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!

679
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,554
Mitch, pull the brake! Pull the brake!

680
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,919
Pull... pull the brake!

681
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,839
Anna, you did it!

682
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,559
You saved me!

683
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,152
Anna... Anna, get me out of here, please!

684
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,079
You did it! Anna, you did it!

685
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,070
No, no, no!

686
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,278
Edgar Munsen was in a coma.

687
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,790
You got one job!
One job to do, you useless mother...

688
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,440
Yeah.

689
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,830
Anything?

690
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,956
<i>Nothing.</i>

691
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,872
Pulled a Houdini. Nobody saw shit.

692
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,559
Just pulling Kramer's casket out now.

693
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,870
<i>Reporters?</i>

694
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,510
Yup.

695
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,196
Good.

696
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,112
End this nonsense once and for all.

697
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,795
<i>John Kramer is dead
and has been for ten years.</i>

698
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,513
<i>Enough of this John Kramer bullshit.</i>

699
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,439
- It's not him!
- Uh...

700
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,713
You may wanna rethink that.

701
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,075
Why? What's going on?

702
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,076
Let's just say you can
call off the hunt for Edgar Munsen.

703
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,435
Oh, come on!

704
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,916
<i>Okay, get a warrant for Bonneville,
I'll see you there.</i>

705
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,231
- Go, go, go.
- Move it! Move it!

706
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,549
Let's go.

707
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,040
Take the left. Two on the right.

708
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,880
Go, go, go, go, go!

709
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,672
- Clear on the left!
- Clear!

710
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,439
- Watch your left.
- Eyes up!

711
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,800
Jesus!

712
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,830
Two left.

713
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,594
So, what, Bonneville just leaves a body
hanging in her studio?

714
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,080
- Come on, man.
- I know.

715
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,920
I'll go pick up Logan.

716
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,749
I'll get the girl.

717
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,512
Gonna need you to show me
those wrists, brother.

718
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,151
- I didn't do anything, Keith.
- Look, listen, listen.

719
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,830
I have photos of you.

720
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,520
Yeah, you and Eleanor
in your warehouse of torture devices.

721
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,120
- Wait, you were there?
- Yeah, I was there.

722
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,795
I just saw a third body that looks like
it's been through a meat grinder.

723
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,519
All right. Someone is trying to frame us.

724
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,273
- Tell me where Eleanor is.
- The studio I can explain.

725
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,919
- You just have to trust...
- You know where she is?

726
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,196
Keith! I'll tell you everything I know.

727
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,633
I know who did this.

728
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,870
And you do, too.

729
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,238
Who found the body at Eleanor's studio?

730
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,315
Jesus!

731
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,319
- Halloran.
- He had motive.

732
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,594
He wanted Edgar dead.

733
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,990
Who ordered the targeting of the remote?

734
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,197
If he moves to trigger it, blow it to shit.

735
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,955
Go on.

736
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,235
Yeah, everybody targeted the trigger,

737
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,119
but did anyone actually see
what Halloran was aiming at?

738
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,558
He had no plan to let Edgar walk.

739
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,390
You think your partner knows
that you're with IA?

740
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,597
- So, I'm right.
- Jesus.

741
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,637
I've been onto Halloran
since before all of this started.

742
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,230
IA has him connected
to multiple homicides going back years.

743
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,839
Now these latest Jigsaw murders.

744
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,549
<i>The three bodies we brought you,</i>

745
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,393
<i>we found they're all mixed up
in Halloran's cases.</i>

746
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,877
Bring him in.

747
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,481
Halloran is trying to frame me.
Don't even know what he's got against me.

748
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:08,115
Really? You know you called him out
for screwing up slam-dunk cases.

749
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,716
You said he was a moron in the press twice.

750
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,951
No, I said he was an impulsive asshole...

751
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,631
twice.

752
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,832
You blame him for what happened
to Christine, don't you?

753
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,033
I don't know how to prove
Halloran's the copycat.

754
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,634
It's Halloran. It's him.

755
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,074
Let me help you build your case.

756
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,435
Let me get you proof.

757
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,113
Let me open up Edgar Munsen.

758
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,795
We match that slug to Halloran's gun.

759
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,080
- What kind of firearm do you use?
- Glock 22.

760
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,276
Most cops do.

761
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,272
Except Halloran. He's got a 17.

762
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,999
Nine by nineteen Parabellum.

763
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,309
That's a Glock 17.

764
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,874
Okay.

765
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,994
I'll take you home.
You stay there until I call you.

766
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,150
I'll get Halloran.

767
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,478
El, where the hell are you?

768
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,833
Call me, it's urgent.

769
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,111
Jesus!

770
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,630
El!

771
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,510
I've been trying to call you.

772
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,798
- I don't know how that body...
- No, no, no. It's okay.

773
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,513
They don't think it's you or me.

774
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,875
They have their sights set on Halloran.

775
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,590
I found it.

776
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,753
<i>I think I know where
the game is being played.</i>

777
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,350
I found the farm.

778
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,350
That's great, let's call a detective.

779
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,590
No!

780
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,036
Halloran's behind this.
We can't trust the cops.

781
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,031
What?

782
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,153
You wanna see this game for yourself.

783
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,035
You get off on this shit?

784
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,716
Logan...

785
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,392
This is a chance for us to save lives.

786
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,394
So we're gonna take on a serial killer
with what, our cunning intellects?

787
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,150
And this.

788
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,392
Anna! Don't leave me!

789
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,849
Anna?

790
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,093
Anna!

791
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,750
I'm bleeding out, Anna!

792
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,793
Motherfucker!

793
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,434
Anna!

794
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,511
Okay.

795
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,520
Anna!

796
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,512
Don't leave me, please!

797
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,716
Hello, Anna.

798
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,590
John?

799
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,190
John Kramer?

800
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,034
What's going on?

801
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,439
You're about to play a game.

802
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,712
Oh, no, no.

803
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,435
What are you doing, John? What are you doing?

804
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,113
It's a final test.

805
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,999
I already passed your test!
Look at my fucking leg!

806
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,397
That wasn't your test, Ryan.

807
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,158
And that wouldn't have been necessary...

808
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,032
if you'd simply played by the rules.

809
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,159
But you don't like rules, do you?

810
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,634
You want me to show mercy?

811
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:47,157
You, who hasn't taken even
a single step toward confessing?

812
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:53,754
You, who is responsible
not for one death, but for three?

813
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,397
<i>Your life of reckless deceit...</i>

814
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,870
- Whoo! Yeah!
- ...started in high school.

815
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,997
- And only grew worse.
- Sit down!

816
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,515
- Sit the fuck down!
- Get the fuck off me!

817
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,630
You lied to the authorities
multiple times, Ryan,

818
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,996
pinning the blame solely on the driver,

819
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,113
your deceased best friend.

820
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,639
You know what you did to his family? Hm?

821
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,759
And you've only gotten worse over the years.

822
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,071
I did it. Okay, I fucking did it.

823
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,436
I did it, but it was so long ago.

824
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,110
I wanna live.

825
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,389
- I wanna live.
- As do I, Ryan.

826
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,149
As do we all.

827
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,235
But things happen.

828
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,394
<i>Were it not for a careless mistake
by a resident at the hospital I was in...</i>

829
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,880
<i>my cancer could have
been diagnosed a lot sooner.</i>

830
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,956
<i>It was simply the wrong name on an X-ray.</i>

831
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,799
Would've saved me a whole lot of hardship.

832
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,640
And you, Anna.

833
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,233
I didn't do anything, John.

834
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,796
You know me!

835
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,433
Please don't do this to me.

836
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,880
We were neighbors, Anna and I.

837
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,359
My first chemo sessions were
very difficult, to say the least.

838
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,598
Anna and her husband, Matthew,

839
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,990
were so kind, so supportive.

840
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,515
I thank you for that.

841
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,832
Why are you doing this to me?

842
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,640
<i>Those were better days for you,
weren't they, Anna?</i>

843
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,032
<i>But your poor husband, Matthew...</i>

844
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,794
<i>I know the two of you
didn't always get along.</i>

845
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,874
<i>But to have to endure that tragedy,
the death of a child, that's, uh...</i>

846
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,236
<i>one of life's greatest burdens, isn't it?</i>

847
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,236
<i>If only he hadn't fallen asleep that night.</i>

848
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,074
Then he wouldn't have rolled over
and, uh, suffocated your baby.

849
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,958
That is what happened, right, Anna?

850
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,155
Shut up! Shut up!

851
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,035
Shut up. Shut up!

852
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,912
I mean, it's horrible, how horrible,

853
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,233
to have to live with such a thing.

854
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,870
<i>It could make a person go mad, couldn't it?</i>

855
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,275
What are you gonna do to us?

856
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,352
Me?

857
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,909
I'm not gonna do anything.

858
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,709
You have to simply assume responsibility.

859
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,790
For who you are.

860
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,350
This is it.

861
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,754
How do you know this is it?

862
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,840
Tuck's Pig Farm.

863
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,198
It was shut down due to an outbreak
of Aujeszky's disease.

864
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,516
Buckethead's sample. The pig virus.

865
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,717
This farm was in Jill Tuck's family.

866
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,635
Jigsaw's wife.

867
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,956
Still is.

868
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,191
Although the place was shuttered years ago.

869
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,838
Well, it looks like somebody's here.

870
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,949
You sure you wanna do this?

871
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,310
Halloran, it's Hunt. Call me back.

872
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,478
We're at Halloran's house, but he's not here.

873
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,399
- You got a location on him?
- Searching.

874
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,675
Sir?

875
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,958
Okay, we need to bring him in. Now!

876
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,400
Check this out.

877
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,069
That's a lot of blood.

878
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,720
What's to bet this is where
Buckethead was decapitated.

879
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,395
It's Jigsaw.

880
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,800
Jigsaw is dead.

881
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,915
Is he?

882
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,709
Please...

883
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,600
I'll do anything you want, John,
just please let me go.

884
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,670
Please.

885
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,954
Did you know that pigs are
highly compassionate animals?

886
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,952
They show distress
if they see any other animal,

887
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,635
including humans, suffering.

888
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,949
What about you, John?

889
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,640
Where is your compassion?

890
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,156
We all have a thumb on the scale, Anna.

891
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,879
For good or for evil.

892
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,994
You've been weighing in
on the wrong side of the scale.

893
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,870
Both of you.

894
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,432
Now, if you want to achieve your freedom,

895
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,200
you have to learn.

896
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,836
You have to realize that...
you've been doing it backwards.

897
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:13,995
So...

898
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,197
I'm gonna give you an opportunity...

899
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,880
to turn it all around.

900
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,195
Here's your key to freedom.

901
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,795
It's all up to you.

902
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,195
Now, the game is simple.

903
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,714
The best ones are.

904
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,795
You have one shotgun.

905
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,795
You have one shell.

906
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,718
Like I said, it's up to you.

907
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,437
How can you say Jigsaw isn't dead?

908
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,030
He's dead.

909
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,952
Autopsy was performed on his body.
He has his own grave.

910
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,030
He's not.

911
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:38,472
Jigsaw lives forever
through the work of his followers.

912
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,111
You.

913
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,836
You've been obsessed
with John Kramer from the start.

914
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,590
The website.

915
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,230
The traps you built.

916
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,111
Lots of people are fascinated by Kramer.

917
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,358
You know damn well I didn't kill Buckethead.

918
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,756
Or the other two.

919
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,194
Then who did?

920
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,397
Halloran. You said it yourself.

921
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,790
The bullet matches.
He's connected to all the victims.

922
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:09,870
He...

923
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,600
Right behind you. Drop it.

924
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,072
Drop it! Both of you.

925
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,038
- Now!
- It's him.

926
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,114
- It's him!
- Go on!

927
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,399
- Don't. Don't.
- Come on.

928
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,516
- Come on!
- All right!

929
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,314
- Don't.
- All right.

930
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,872
All right, I'm putting it down.

931
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,519
Now it's your turn, sweetheart.

932
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,390
Come on, sweetheart.

933
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,514
- No.
- Come on.

934
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,670
Put it down.

935
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,713
I'll blow his fucking brains out.

936
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,554
- El.
- Yeah.

937
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,755
That's a good girl.

938
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,199
All right. You got what you...

939
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:48,390
Run!

940
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,913
He wants us to shoot each other.

941
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,400
He wants me to kill you.

942
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,040
No.

943
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,952
No. No, don't!

944
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,554
No, don't touch that, you psycho bitch!

945
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,040
- It's the only way!
- No, no!

946
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,635
No. No. No, okay?

947
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,872
No. No, please don't.
Because that's what he wants us to do.

948
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,838
- Okay? Think about it.
- Thumb on the scale.

949
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,560
No. No, please don't. Okay? Please.

950
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,915
- No, no, no.
- Good or evil.

951
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,116
- No, please don't.
- That's what he said.

952
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,953
Think about this for a minute, okay?
Just think.

953
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,350
We're supposed to follow the rules.
We have to play by the rules.

954
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,239
My only key to freedom...

955
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,915
is to kill you.

956
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,353
Please!

957
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,996
- Please don't! Please don't!
- I'm sorry.

958
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,197
- I'm sorry.
- Please don't! Please don't!

959
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,790
Backwards...

960
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,512
He... He said we've got it backwards!

961
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,870
No!

962
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,995
Oh, my God.

963
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,640
Oh, my God.

964
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,480
Oh, my God.

965
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,550
No.

966
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,390
No.

967
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,990
No!

968
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,514
No.

969
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,712
<i>No. No.</i>

970
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,600
Here's your key to freedom.

971
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,352
No. No.

972
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,117
No. No.

973
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,433
We could have been free, Anna.

974
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,149
I'm sorry.

975
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,514
Halloran.

976
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,799
Help! Somebody!

977
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,155
Help!

978
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,993
What the fuck are these? What the fuck?

979
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,679
These are goddamn laser cutters.

980
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,233
What? What?

981
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,720
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

982
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,431
Wait, what happened? Where's Eleanor?

983
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,439
- Halloran!
- Someone came out of nowhere.

984
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,239
Drugged me. Knocked me out.

985
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,960
Yeah, me too.

986
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,238
<i>Hello, gentlemen.
You came looking for the game.</i>

987
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,676
<i>Congratulations, you found it.</i>

988
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,396
<i>You are the final two players.</i>

989
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,151
It can't be.

990
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:04,076
<i>You may recognize the device
around your collar, Dr. Nelson.</i>

991
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:10,116
<i>These laser cutters slice
through tissue and bone like butter.</i>

992
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,714
<i>The most powerful blade on the planet.</i>

993
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,998
<i>You both have an opportunity to live.</i>

994
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,993
<i>All you need to do is confess.</i>

995
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,554
- Confess?
- <i>It's that easy.</i>

996
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:27,400
<i>If you admit to the reason
that you deserve to die...</i>

997
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,475
<i>you can escape death.</i>

998
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,680
<i>I will be listening.</i>

999
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,875
<i>Make your choice.</i>

1000
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,429
How are you alive?

1001
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,591
How are you still alive!

1002
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:42,636
<i>The game will select one of you
to begin in 60 seconds.</i>

1003
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:46,552
<i>Unless, of course,
someone chooses to go first.</i>

1004
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,951
Let's neither of us touch a button.

1005
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,793
We're both gonna be fucked in a minute.

1006
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:57,831
I'll go first.

1007
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,190
Okay.

1008
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,312
Wait! No, no, no, no!

1009
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,073
No! No!

1010
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,196
Oh, God!

1011
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,239
I've done nothing wrong!

1012
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,036
No! Stop! Stop it!

1013
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,554
- Stop it!
- I'd confess.

1014
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,913
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay, okay! All right!

1015
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,071
All right, John Kramer! It was me!

1016
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,154
It was me! I fucked up!

1017
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,559
I messed up your X-rays!

1018
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,037
I was... I was careless.

1019
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,235
And I am sorry.

1020
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,349
I'm so sorry.

1021
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,430
I confess.

1022
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,040
I confess.

1023
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,918
Christine, I'm so sorry, baby.

1024
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,633
I should have been there for you.

1025
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,515
But I wasn't.

1026
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,112
<i>Your turn, Detective.</i>

1027
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,079
No! No, no, no! I won! I won! I won!

1028
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,115
Oh, shit!

1029
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,517
- Oh, shit.
- <i>Confess.</i>

1030
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,670
Okay.

1031
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,953
I did some shitty things.

1032
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,231
But the system's broken, I tried to fix it!

1033
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,590
Okay! Okay!

1034
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,071
I tampered with evidence.

1035
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,992
I... I took bribes.

1036
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,233
I put innocent people away.

1037
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,999
Murderers and rapists walked.

1038
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,239
People died because of me!

1039
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,832
Innocent people died because of me!

1040
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:51,910
I did it!

1041
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,800
It fucking can't be.

1042
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,635
What?

1043
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,360
Hey, hey, hey...

1044
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,113
Wha... What is this?

1045
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:38,550
What are you...

1046
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,070
What? Are you fucking kidding me?

1047
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,390
Logan, you...

1048
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,230
What?

1049
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,913
What? Hey!

1050
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,150
What? You...

1051
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,395
You're working with him?

1052
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,435
I am him.

1053
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,636
What?

1054
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:02,472
And with a little help from you,
no one will ever suspect it.

1055
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,599
<i>People died because of me!</i>

1056
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,192
<i>Innocent people died because of me.</i>

1057
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,270
<i>I did it!</i>

1058
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:10,990
I don't understand.

1059
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,399
Ten years ago, in this very barn...

1060
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,199
a game was played.

1061
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,512
Supposedly, John Kramer designed this

1062
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,432
for a game that took place
before all the others.

1063
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,393
<i>The bodies were never found.</i>

1064
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,635
I know this because I was one of the players.

1065
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,155
<i>Jigsaw put me in that game
almost ten years ago.</i>

1066
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,040
<i>I mixed up his X-ray.</i>

1067
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,239
You need to cut yourself!

1068
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:18,273
<i>John decided I shouldn't have to die
over an honest mistake.</i>

1069
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,880
<i>He gave me a second chance.</i>

1070
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,597
So now, ten years later,

1071
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:29,037
I've recreated Jigsaw's game
with criminals from your failed cases.

1072
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,271
What?

1073
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,194
<i>I wanted my game to be identical to Jigsaw's.</i>

1074
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,598
<i>So I went through your cases.</i>

1075
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,275
<i>Found players just like
the ones in the original game.</i>

1076
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:44,320
<i>I gave them the same choices
that Jigsaw did a decade ago.</i>

1077
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,871
<i>Jigsaw put five people in his game.</i>

1078
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,519
<i>I put in three.</i>

1079
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,512
<i>You and I are the last two.</i>

1080
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,517
I wanted to see if I was as worthy as him.

1081
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,751
As... talented.

1082
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,914
No...

1083
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,670
Come on, Logan.

1084
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,592
Come on. Have mercy.

1085
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,273
Like you just had mercy on me?

1086
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,752
When you started our game just now?

1087
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,634
Pushing my button?

1088
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,034
Saving yourself.

1089
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,635
What?

1090
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,040
That's not fair!

1091
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,110
Fair?

1092
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,553
Why was Edgar Munsen free?

1093
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:25,960
<i>He was a murderer.</i>

1094
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:30,159
But you were protecting him because
he was your criminal informant years ago.

1095
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,836
And you let him walk free.

1096
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,440
Edgar Munsen killed my wife.

1097
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,752
You don't... You don't know that.
It's never been proven.

1098
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,599
This...

1099
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,000
won't...

1100
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,400
bring your family back.

1101
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,472
John Kramer...

1102
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,312
gave people a chance to win the game.

1103
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,069
A choice.

1104
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,672
Fuck! You fucker.

1105
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,160
You have a choice.

1106
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,236
Scream, or don't.

1107
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,914
Logan, Logan, Logan, Logan.
Hey, look, I can help you.

1108
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,878
I can... I can do things for you.

1109
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,359
Can you bring my wife back?

1110
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,599
Doesn't matter what I say, does it?

1111
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,395
<i>I created a game that
appeared to be run by Jigsaw.</i>

1112
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,598
<i>Hello, Edgar. You're about to play a game.</i>

1113
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,876
<i>Five lives are in your hands.</i>

1114
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,471
<i>Follow my instructions exactly.</i>

1115
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,911
I gotta choose who dies, them or me.

1116
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,752
I'm not fucking dying.

1117
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,000
What kind of firearm do you use?

1118
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,231
Glock 22. Most cops do.

1119
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,198
Except Halloran, he's got a 17.

1120
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,672
Nine by nineteen Parabellum.
That's a Glock 17.

1121
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,276
The blood under the fingernails
of our first victim...

1122
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,274
<i>is John Kramer's blood.</i>

1123
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,553
<i>Some will think it's Jigsaw.</i>

1124
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,429
<i>Some will suspect you.</i>

1125
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,277
<i>But no one will suspect me.</i>

1126
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,477
Okay, we need to bring him in. Now!

1127
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,160
<i>Because Eleanor will provide my alibi.</i>

1128
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,110
Oh, yes.

1129
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,754
Ten years ago,
I came out of the war a broken man.

1130
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:43,239
<i>Jigsaw put the pieces of my life
back together again.</i>

1131
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,993
<i>He gave my life purpose.</i>

1132
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,996
We can never come
from anger or from vengeance.

1133
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:57,990
You taught me that.

1134
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,559
But then there will be no justice.

1135
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,717
Ah, but there will!

1136
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,753
Because we'll speak for the dead.

1137
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,233
<i>Together, we built a legacy.</i>

1138
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:21,273
Now, I speak for the lives
ruined by people like you.

1139
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,716
Murderers. Rapists.

1140
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:27,476
Their victims appeared
on my table because of you.

1141
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,153
No. No.

1142
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,549
No...

1143
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,915
No...

1144
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,994
I speak for the dead.

1144
01:24:54,305 --> 01:25:54,911
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
