1
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,197
You lose.

2
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,526
Again.

3
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:26,078
I changed your flight sequence.

4
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:28,159
That's enough.

5
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:29,913
Pay attention.

6
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:32,370
Pericles, stop! Or no treat!

7
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,085
How well do I know you?

8
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:21,209
Hey, there you are.

9
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,711
Was the homo sapien mean to you?

10
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:27,344
We all know it's just rocket envy.

11
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:31,342
- Ever consider a boyfriend?
- Do I enjoy being miserable?

12
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:33,846
- I'll stick with my chimps.
Hey.

13
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:41,859
- I'm teaching him.
- You're teasing him.

14
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:46,070
He's gene-spliced, chromosome-
enhanced. He can handle it.

15
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:51,112
When you frustrate them, they lose
focus. They even get violent.

16
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:54,457
Hey, Pericles,
you're gonna be a daddy.

17
00:05:55,377 --> 00:06:00,253
- Thought I saw a smirk on his face.
- The female was the aggressor.

18
00:06:00,465 --> 00:06:02,754
Hey, Leo. You got a postcard.

19
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,878
<i>Leo!</i>

20
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:12,549
<i>It's been two years.
When are you coming home?</i>

21
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:15,594
<i>Not too quick.
I'm enjoying that apartment.</i>

22
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:18,560
<i>- No, we miss you!
- Are you flying yet?</i>

23
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:23,732
<i>- Or are the chimps doing the work?
- We got something to tell you.</i>

24
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:28,569
<i>When you gonna make
that kind of commitment...</i>

25
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,559
<i>Captain Davidson,
report to the bridge.</i>

26
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:09,695
Found it.
It's moving like a storm.

27
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:12,695
It is. It's an electromagnetic storm.

28
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:16,659
The digital clocks are stopped.
It's beautiful.

29
00:07:16,873 --> 00:07:20,325
- So is the sun till you get close.
This is weird.

30
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:24,375
I hear frequency patterns.
- Tune them in.

31
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:30,089
It's electronic communication
from Earth, from all time.

32
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:33,096
The storm's bouncing it back to us.

33
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:37,682
We'll start with a pass
through the core.

34
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:42,098
Take radiation gamma-ray reading.
Get your monkey ready.

35
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:45,316
Sir, this is a waste of time.

36
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:47,270
We have standard procedures...

37
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:51,573
- I'm aware of the procedures, but...
- No manned flights.

38
00:07:51,824 --> 00:07:55,607
We send an ape. If it's safe,
we talk about a pilot.

39
00:07:55,828 --> 00:07:58,829
Why don't you just allow me
to do my job?

40
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,535
He's the canary, that's the coal mine.
He launches at 16:00.

41
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,557
Just follow your sequence
and come home. Understand? Home.

42
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:40,693
<i>Stand by. Alpha pod launch
in 30 seconds.</i>

43
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,549
<i>Chart his course
to the eye of the storm.</i>

44
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:06,134
<i>Okay, Pericles, start sequence one.</i>

45
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:15,651
Activate reading systems.

46
00:09:21,286 --> 00:09:22,828
<i>Ignition.</i>

47
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:34,707
<i>Have him start
taking perimeter readings.</i>

48
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,755
- What's wrong?
- He's off-course.

49
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,095
Lock on him.

50
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,477
He can't respond, sir.

51
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:53,314
- There's a surge in the heart rate.
- Light him up again.

52
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,359
I can't.

53
00:09:57,906 --> 00:09:58,984
He's gone.

54
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:01,400
He's trained to come back.

55
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:04,324
You think he's still alive?

56
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:12,209
- Sir...
- For now, we just sit tight and wait.

57
00:10:13,587 --> 00:10:17,880
I'm gonna run some sequences
to see what he did wrong.

58
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:29,301
<i>The signal is breaking up.
He must be panicking.</i>

59
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,511
<i>He'll return to the Oberon.</i>

60
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,182
<i>I can 't hold him.</i>

61
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:35,106
<i>That's it, we lost him.</i>

62
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:39,107
Wanna send up another chimp?
- It's too dangerous.

63
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,444
<i>I won 't waste another pod.</i>

64
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:44,188
<i>Shut down launch operations.</i>

65
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,433
Sir?

66
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:19,518
Delta pod has launched.

67
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:24,776
Your flight is not authorized!

68
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,817
I'm going to get my chimp.

69
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:30,533
<i>Bring that thing back here!
Return to base!</i>

70
00:11:30,745 --> 00:11:33,782
Never send a monkey to do a man's job.

71
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:56,553
I got a visual on Alpha pod.

72
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:14,404
<i>Oberon, come back!</i>

73
00:12:27,843 --> 00:12:30,001
<i>Oberon, come in!</i>

74
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:43,815
- I'm getting a mayday, sir.
- Alpha pod?

75
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:47,482
- I don't know, but it's strong.
Put it up.

76
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:50,820
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Come in!</i>

77
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:54,656
<i>Request... We're going down! Mayday!</i>

78
00:12:56,663 --> 00:12:58,157
Delta pod, abort.

79
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:20,099
This one looked at me.

80
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:31,646
Take your stinking hands off me,
you damn dirty human!

81
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,876
Stinking humans!

82
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:57,380
You guys smell!

83
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,101
Hey, where am I?

84
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:57,023
What is this place?

85
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:11,376
Here! I'm open! Come on!

86
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,457
Dribble it down! Take it!

87
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,469
Make way! Clear the path!

88
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,345
Get the humans!

89
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:28,301
You guys smell!

90
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,307
Take this!

91
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,309
Stupid human!
Stop it!

92
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:44,482
- Who said to throw stones at humans?
- My father.

93
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,446
Well, he's wrong.

94
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,865
- And you can tell him I said so.
- Human-lover.

95
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,890
Move along!

96
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,234
Are you trying
to put me out of business?

97
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,987
These are the skankiest, scabbiest...

98
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,911
...skuzziest humans I've ever seen.

99
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:32,242
- You don't want them?
- I'll take the whole lot.

100
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,586
I must be out of my mind.

101
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,292
I'll have to make it up on volume.

102
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,334
All right, get them out...

103
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,255
...and get them clean! Chop, chop!

104
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,554
Let's go!

105
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,470
Keep it moving!

106
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:56,306
Come on! Hurry up!

107
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:04,525
Gentlemen to the left!
Ladies to the right, please!

108
00:22:04,947 --> 00:22:06,192
Don't be afraid.

109
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:08,068
Come on.

110
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:12,866
Very touching. I can't see
for the tears in my eyes.

111
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:16,284
Come on. That one's
crawling with lice.

112
00:22:18,335 --> 00:22:22,167
Check the teeth
on that little one. Nice.

113
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:34,424
Stay back. Back!

114
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:38,262
Get in there!

115
00:22:42,025 --> 00:22:43,816
Move! You too!

116
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:50,277
How many times have I told you to
wear gloves when you handle humans?

117
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:58,247
You normally hack off a limb, Limbo.

118
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,370
Yes, general. That's true.

119
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:04,871
Unfortunately,
they're worth more intact.

120
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:09,760
Keep your eye on this one.

121
00:23:11,262 --> 00:23:13,218
He's feisty.

122
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,053
Were these the ones
raiding the orchards?

123
00:23:22,314 --> 00:23:26,525
I know an old country remedy
that never fails.

124
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,692
You gut one human,
and you string the carcass up.

125
00:23:30,906 --> 00:23:34,690
The Human Rights faction
is on me already.

126
00:23:34,951 --> 00:23:38,865
Do-gooders. Who needs them?
I'm for free speech as long as they...

127
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,452
...keep their mouths shut.

128
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:43,871
My niece wants one
for her birthday.

129
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:50,757
Excellent. The little ones
make wonderful pets.

130
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:54,300
But be sure
you get rid of it by puberty.

131
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:59,257
One thing you don't want in your
house, it's a human teenager.

132
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:05,227
Any one you'd like, sweetheart.

133
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:08,893
That one.

134
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:12,444
Oh, isn't she pretty.

135
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:19,616
I'll get that for you, sir.

136
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:41,255
And I have a pretty new collar...

137
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:43,682
...just for you.

138
00:24:45,103 --> 00:24:46,977
Compliments of the house.

139
00:24:51,442 --> 00:24:53,768
You stink of humans.

140
00:25:05,623 --> 00:25:08,827
It's disgusting
the way we treat humans.

141
00:25:09,085 --> 00:25:11,658
It demeans us as much as them.

142
00:25:17,635 --> 00:25:19,462
Ari, let's go.

143
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:30,229
Get them marked!
I got orders to fill!

144
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:52,744
Next!

145
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,725
Not you again.

146
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:13,727
I can't stand by while humans
are being mistreated and tortured.

147
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:20,145
The only reason I put up with your
nonsense is because of your father!

148
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:23,447
You want me to stop?
Give up the business.

149
00:26:23,657 --> 00:26:27,027
Hey, I do the job
that nobody else wants!

150
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,904
I don't see you bleeding-hearts
spending all day...

151
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:34,788
...with these dangerous,
dirty, dumb beasts.

152
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:38,620
They can be taught
to live with us as equals.

153
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,464
I'm gonna prove it.

154
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,126
Don't do that.

155
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:46,676
Don't do that.

156
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,635
Stay back.

157
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:53,140
Well, now there's your proof.

158
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:56,387
Now I'm gonna have to put him down.

159
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:58,060
Help me.

160
00:26:58,567 --> 00:26:59,812
Please.

161
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:02,563
Please help me.

162
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:08,566
You're giving me such a headache.

163
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,239
I don't need this aggravation!

164
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:17,747
Sell him to me.

165
00:27:18,086 --> 00:27:21,585
Are you crazy? He's wild.
They're both wild.

166
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:23,333
Then I'll buy them both.

167
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:26,926
That would be expensive.

168
00:27:28,262 --> 00:27:30,588
That would be...

169
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:32,924
...very, very expensive.

170
00:27:39,773 --> 00:27:41,184
I'm sure we can...

171
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:43,934
...you know, come to a deal.

172
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:47,108
You know?

173
00:27:52,953 --> 00:27:55,111
Deliver them to my house.

174
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:01,117
<i>Semos, help me!</i>

175
00:28:02,963 --> 00:28:05,631
Rise when your master enters.

176
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:12,217
Wild humans...

177
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:15,465
...in my house.

178
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:17,968
This one seems different.

179
00:28:18,185 --> 00:28:22,764
How could he be different?
You can't tell one from the other!

180
00:28:22,982 --> 00:28:24,642
My guests are here.

181
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:28,733
Keep the savage ones out of sight.

182
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:35,906
Especially from General Thade!

183
00:28:36,621 --> 00:28:39,111
You'd better be nice to him!

184
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,710
And wash your hands before dinner.

185
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:56,754
Senator, good evening.
Dear, you look lovely tonight.

186
00:28:57,016 --> 00:28:59,506
But I'm having a bad hair day.

187
00:28:59,768 --> 00:29:02,603
Yet, she spends a fortune grooming.

188
00:29:02,938 --> 00:29:04,930
And I'm worth every penny.

189
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:09,017
Would you like to freshen up?

190
00:29:10,445 --> 00:29:11,643
We're fine.

191
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,958
- How'd these monkeys get like this?
- How else would they be?

192
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:38,212
- They'd be begging me for a treat.
- What tribe are you from?

193
00:29:38,973 --> 00:29:41,808
U.S. Air Force. I'm going back to it.

194
00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:59,649
Finish your work.

195
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:06,823
Please, everyone sit.

196
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:12,169
We just returned
from our country house.

197
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:14,499
- How was it?
- Boring.

198
00:30:14,842 --> 00:30:19,503
I find it relaxing being away
from the bustle of the city.

199
00:30:19,763 --> 00:30:22,004
There was no place to go.

200
00:30:22,348 --> 00:30:25,468
Nothing but trees and rocks.

201
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:28,851
- All you did was nap.
- Exactly.

202
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:31,602
Time away from politics...

203
00:30:31,816 --> 00:30:33,690
...is what I needed.

204
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:39,731
We'd lose ourselves for days
in the forest when we were young.

205
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:42,155
Now I can barely climb a tree.

206
00:30:42,785 --> 00:30:46,569
Trite but true:
"Youth is wasted on the young."

207
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:51,995
Oh, how did I get so old so fast?

208
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:56,671
Living with your daughter
would age any ape quickly.

209
00:30:56,882 --> 00:30:59,420
You've been a stranger lately.

210
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:02,838
I apologize for my lateness, senator.

211
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:07,763
I stopped to see my father.

212
00:31:07,976 --> 00:31:11,143
- How's my old friend?
- Slipping, I'm afraid.

213
00:31:11,355 --> 00:31:15,732
I'd like to see him more,
but these are troubled days.

214
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:18,226
The humans infest the provinces.

215
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:20,770
We encroach upon their habitat.

216
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:24,358
They breed while we grow soft
in our affluence.

217
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:27,031
They outnumber us four to one!

218
00:31:27,245 --> 00:31:29,818
Why can't we simply
sterilize them all?

219
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:32,824
The cost would be prohibitive.

220
00:31:33,168 --> 00:31:35,374
Although scientists tell me...

221
00:31:35,628 --> 00:31:38,962
...these humans
carry terrible diseases.

222
00:31:39,174 --> 00:31:40,584
How would we know?

223
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,501
The army burns the bodies
before they're examined.

224
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:49,677
Father?

225
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:59,315
At times, perhaps, the senate feels
that the army has been...

226
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:01,186
...a tad extreme.

227
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:06,824
Extremism in defense of apes
is no vice, senator!

228
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,864
Your ideas threaten our prosperity!

229
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:13,538
The human problem
can't be solved with money!

230
00:32:13,748 --> 00:32:16,916
We tried that once,
and all we got was...

231
00:32:17,127 --> 00:32:19,997
...a welfare state that nearly broke us.

232
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:24,585
I think the city has about
as much diversity as I can handle.

233
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:30,011
This garment was made
by one of my humans.

234
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:33,797
And can you deny the skill?

235
00:32:34,477 --> 00:32:37,514
Obviously, they're capable
of a real culture.

236
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:43,107
Everything in the human culture
takes place below the waist.

237
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:51,617
Bow your heads!

238
00:32:55,748 --> 00:32:58,832
We give thanks
for the fruit of the land.

239
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:03,871
Bless us, holy father, who created
all apes in his image.

240
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:09,511
Hasten the day when you will return
and bring peace to your children.

241
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,424
<i>- Amen.
Amen.</i>

242
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:23,604
Next you'll be telling us
these beasts have a soul.

243
00:33:24,108 --> 00:33:25,437
Of course they do.

244
00:33:25,652 --> 00:33:29,567
The senator's daughter
flirts with blasphemy.

245
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:43,793
Is there a soul in there?

246
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,551
Do you have a towel?

247
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:07,608
I've lost my appetite.

248
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:45,510
I'm bored by these society dinners.

249
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,597
- I came to see you.
- Oh, how sweet.

250
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:51,775
You've wasted your time.

251
00:34:52,362 --> 00:34:54,438
My feelings haven't changed.

252
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:57,229
I still care about you.

253
00:35:00,328 --> 00:35:05,155
You only care about my father's
influence. And your own ambition.

254
00:35:08,544 --> 00:35:11,830
I know about the trouble
you caused today.

255
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:16,460
- I could have you arrested.
- I'd do it again.

256
00:35:17,553 --> 00:35:20,554
You feel so much for these humans...

257
00:35:21,223 --> 00:35:23,512
...yet you feel nothing for me.

258
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:37,947
A moment, sir.

259
00:35:39,908 --> 00:35:41,283
What is it?

260
00:35:41,451 --> 00:35:45,283
We found something.
We think you should see it.

261
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:18,558
There's a curfew.

262
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,151
If they see you, they kill you.

263
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:24,367
You stay here, you're already dead.

264
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:29,992
Can you take me to
where we were caught?

265
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,451
Not without my family.

266
00:36:51,854 --> 00:36:53,311
This is where I saw it.

267
00:36:56,358 --> 00:36:57,389
Go on.

268
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:02,443
Something fell from the sky
with wings of fire.

269
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:06,950
There was a thunderous sound
and the ground itself shook.

270
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:11,110
- You weren't dreaming this?
- It was no dream, sir.

271
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:12,741
Look.

272
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,800
- You told no one?
No, sir.

273
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,671
We had to come right to you.

274
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:29,837
You did exactly the right thing.

275
00:38:18,521 --> 00:38:19,635
You smell that?

276
00:38:19,856 --> 00:38:22,429
Don't start now. We're off-duty.

277
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,393
And I'm starving.

278
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,193
You're hurt.

279
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,706
How did you get away?

280
00:38:57,934 --> 00:39:00,686
- Who are you?
- Somebody trying to get out.

281
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:07,684
She promised to take me back.

282
00:39:09,028 --> 00:39:13,157
This is a house-human.
He thinks he's better than us.

283
00:39:13,366 --> 00:39:14,315
Hey!

284
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:18,577
We'll go together.

285
00:40:49,877 --> 00:40:52,119
Good night, little girl.

286
00:41:16,236 --> 00:41:17,814
You go this way.

287
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,068
The rest of you, come with me.

288
00:41:35,254 --> 00:41:37,710
Send a squad to the north gate! Hurry!

289
00:41:39,341 --> 00:41:41,548
Wait! Someone's coming.

290
00:41:56,484 --> 00:41:59,021
You're lucky I found you first.

291
00:41:59,486 --> 00:42:02,108
Come on. I can reason with them.

292
00:42:02,323 --> 00:42:05,489
- We know how apes reason.
- How can we escape?

293
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,322
Don't get involved with these humans.

294
00:42:09,163 --> 00:42:11,154
Why did you help me?

295
00:42:12,082 --> 00:42:14,288
Why would you take that chance?

296
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:16,707
Because...

297
00:42:17,212 --> 00:42:20,663
...you're not usual.

298
00:42:21,258 --> 00:42:26,596
Show me a way out. I'll show you
something that will change your world.

299
00:42:30,975 --> 00:42:32,434
Trust me.

300
00:42:42,445 --> 00:42:43,773
When I was little...

301
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:48,775
...I used to sneak outside the city,
where no one could find me.

302
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,400
I can show you.

303
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:56,208
If we're caught, no one can protect us!

304
00:42:56,917 --> 00:42:58,292
Trust me.

305
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:05,173
What about her?

306
00:43:06,301 --> 00:43:11,010
- A human child won't survive.
- Bon can take her. Hide her at home.

307
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:28,531
Check every house!

308
00:43:30,992 --> 00:43:34,326
Have you seen any humans?
- No.

309
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:45,213
Hurry!

310
00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:50,546
- Father.
- I'll be right beside you.

311
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:51,793
Come on!

312
00:44:08,987 --> 00:44:09,901
No!

313
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:14,278
Stop!

314
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:44,392
- Where are the other humans?
- Through the tunnels.

315
00:44:44,606 --> 00:44:47,144
When you find them, kill them all.

316
00:44:48,192 --> 00:44:52,736
Except for the troublemaker.
I want to talk to him before he dies.

317
00:44:53,406 --> 00:44:56,323
Sir, the senator's daughter is with them.

318
00:44:58,786 --> 00:45:03,412
- They took her?
- She's helping them. I saw her myself.

319
00:45:07,461 --> 00:45:10,913
She had no choice.
They threatened her life.

320
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:18,222
I'll report to the Senate. They'll beat
their chests and ask for my help.

321
00:45:18,514 --> 00:45:20,921
They are weak without you, sir.

322
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:44,537
- Your dad was brave.
- What do you know?

323
00:45:48,626 --> 00:45:50,121
Let me go.

324
00:45:56,843 --> 00:46:00,342
Thade will come soon.
We can still go back.

325
00:46:02,515 --> 00:46:04,306
I can't now.

326
00:46:25,787 --> 00:46:27,661
That's where I flew in.

327
00:46:29,792 --> 00:46:30,871
You did that?

328
00:46:31,085 --> 00:46:32,708
No, my retroburners.

329
00:46:33,503 --> 00:46:37,667
- I'm sure he'll explain.
- He can't explain what can't exist.

330
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:39,964
Talking monkeys can't exist.

331
00:46:46,432 --> 00:46:48,141
Apes.

332
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:52,218
Monkeys are further down
the evolutionary ladder.

333
00:46:52,438 --> 00:46:55,393
Just above humans.

334
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:01,857
Calm down, will you?

335
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:10,779
- What's wrong?
- Afraid of water. Apes can't swim.

336
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:12,077
We drown.

337
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:15,204
That's why every day we pray for rain.

338
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:44,897
How long can a human
hold its breath underwater?

339
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:41,956
Thought you were afraid of water.
Two dead monkey...

340
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,997
Apes down at the bottom.

341
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:47,753
Someone else knows you're here.

342
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,321
- What's that?
- A frequency with...

343
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:13,697
...my ship so I can talk to them.

344
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:14,905
It talks?

345
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,532
With radio waves.

346
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,283
Sorcery.

347
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:21,325
Not sorcery, science.

348
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,207
I have contact.

349
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:36,176
They're already here.
They must be waiting for me.

350
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,055
It'll lead us to them.

351
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:44,429
We're in control now.
We're the 800-pound gorilla.

352
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,064
Who are you?

353
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:52,029
Captain Leo Davidson.
Pilot, U.S. Air Force.

354
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,358
- From planet Earth.
- Your apes let you fly?

355
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,411
They live in zoos and do what we say.

356
00:50:00,538 --> 00:50:02,827
This is hostile.
I got 36 hours...

357
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:06,575
...to find my friends
and I'm out of this nightmare.

358
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,630
What happens to us?
Where do we go?

359
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:14,462
You go nowhere. He belongs to me!

360
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,301
Stop!

361
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,387
You, I've had enough of!

362
00:50:33,153 --> 00:50:35,479
Take it easy, little fella.

363
00:50:35,698 --> 00:50:37,774
I'm not gonna hurt you.

364
00:50:38,284 --> 00:50:40,490
I wouldn't hurt my property.

365
00:50:43,455 --> 00:50:45,447
But I'll make an exception.

366
00:50:53,548 --> 00:50:56,550
No harm done. Come here, kid.

367
00:50:57,094 --> 00:50:58,884
Come here.

368
00:50:59,596 --> 00:51:03,676
You're not hurt, right? You're young.

369
00:51:03,934 --> 00:51:07,018
Oh, these kids.
They bounce right back.

370
00:51:08,104 --> 00:51:09,515
Play dead.

371
00:51:10,983 --> 00:51:13,105
- Kill him.
- Slave trader.

372
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,236
You kill him, you lower
yourself to his level.

373
00:51:19,699 --> 00:51:20,944
Exactly.

374
00:51:22,535 --> 00:51:24,326
She is extremely smart.

375
00:51:24,578 --> 00:51:27,698
I've heard her talk
about apes and humans.

376
00:51:27,915 --> 00:51:31,995
"Separate but equal."
"To each his own."

377
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:34,536
Something like that. Right?

378
00:51:34,797 --> 00:51:37,750
Whatever it is, I agree.

379
00:51:37,966 --> 00:51:40,671
Can't we all just get along?

380
00:51:45,891 --> 00:51:50,599
I'm probably just in the way.
So why don't I just get going?

381
00:51:52,814 --> 00:51:54,807
He'll lead them to us.

382
00:51:55,025 --> 00:51:57,064
Then we'll make him our guest.

383
00:51:57,944 --> 00:51:59,403
Cuff him.

384
00:52:05,493 --> 00:52:07,700
Ow! These things hurt.

385
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:16,663
- What are you doing?
- You could use that against us.

386
00:52:16,921 --> 00:52:19,922
- Who invented that?
- It was gonna save us.

387
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:21,877
- We're better off now.
- We?

388
00:52:23,094 --> 00:52:25,763
- You're so difficult.
- Like a slave?

389
00:52:25,972 --> 00:52:28,344
- That's not what...
- Shut up!

390
00:52:29,392 --> 00:52:31,468
That goes for all species.

391
00:52:41,571 --> 00:52:46,695
If ever I thought those humans were
capable of kidnapping my daughter...

392
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:49,364
Don't blame yourself, senator.

393
00:52:49,578 --> 00:52:52,579
You've been compassionate with them.

394
00:52:52,831 --> 00:52:54,871
Look how they've repaid you.

395
00:52:55,084 --> 00:52:56,957
Can you find her?

396
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:01,582
If you untie my hands.

397
00:53:02,966 --> 00:53:04,840
What do you want?

398
00:53:05,093 --> 00:53:07,003
Declare martial law.

399
00:53:08,389 --> 00:53:10,511
Give me absolute power...

400
00:53:10,765 --> 00:53:14,217
...to rid this planet of humans
once and for all.

401
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:20,274
Now is not the time to be timid
or indecisive.

402
00:53:21,068 --> 00:53:24,851
I'm the one who can bring
your daughter back alive.

403
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:46,129
He's not in the city.

404
00:53:46,926 --> 00:53:48,883
We underestimate this human.

405
00:53:50,596 --> 00:53:52,174
I'll hunt him down.

406
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,891
Your father sent me.
You must come quickly.

407
00:54:06,737 --> 00:54:09,903
Warn the outposts.
Don't let the humans pass.

408
00:54:10,157 --> 00:54:11,485
I understand, sir.

409
00:54:12,493 --> 00:54:15,446
Apart from my father,
I rely on you most.

410
00:54:15,662 --> 00:54:19,197
We are not just soldiers.
We are friends.

411
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:21,536
I'll depend on you.

412
00:54:22,085 --> 00:54:23,283
Yes, sir.

413
00:54:39,185 --> 00:54:42,055
- So many questions I want to ask.
- Me too.

414
00:54:42,271 --> 00:54:43,931
These "zoos"...

415
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:47,398
What are they? This word is
not familiar.

416
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:51,442
- Our last apes are in zoos.
- What happened to them?

417
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:53,114
Gone.

418
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,779
After we cut down the forests...

419
00:54:56,702 --> 00:54:58,695
...the ones who survived...

420
00:54:59,413 --> 00:55:01,619
...were locked up in cages.

421
00:55:01,874 --> 00:55:04,330
Used for scientific experiment.

422
00:55:04,585 --> 00:55:08,333
- That's horrible.
- We do worse to our own kind.

423
00:55:08,547 --> 00:55:11,501
I don't understand.
You seem intelligent.

424
00:55:11,717 --> 00:55:15,631
Smarter we get, the more
dangerous our world becomes.

425
00:55:17,306 --> 00:55:19,594
I knew it. You're sensitive.

426
00:55:20,892 --> 00:55:22,885
Uncommon quality in a male.

427
00:55:24,813 --> 00:55:28,727
Why don't your apes object
to the way you treat them?

428
00:55:29,442 --> 00:55:30,771
They can't talk.

429
00:55:30,986 --> 00:55:34,769
Maybe they choose not to,
given the way you treat them.

430
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,574
Apes in cages. Right.

431
00:56:02,558 --> 00:56:04,265
Father.

432
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:10,768
I don't have much time.

433
00:56:11,024 --> 00:56:14,061
Tell me about this human...

434
00:56:14,445 --> 00:56:16,319
...who troubles you.

435
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:20,406
I will capture him
with little trouble.

436
00:56:22,202 --> 00:56:24,657
No. You're not telling me everything.

437
00:56:26,832 --> 00:56:29,667
You believe he is not born
of this world.

438
00:56:33,004 --> 00:56:35,044
Has he come alone?

439
00:56:35,549 --> 00:56:36,746
Yes.

440
00:56:37,842 --> 00:56:40,796
More will come looking for him.

441
00:56:41,012 --> 00:56:43,135
How can you possibly know?

442
00:56:46,893 --> 00:56:50,095
I have something to tell you.

443
00:56:50,855 --> 00:56:53,560
Something my father told me...

444
00:56:53,775 --> 00:56:57,439
...and his father told him.

445
00:56:57,695 --> 00:57:02,073
Back along our bloodlines to Semos.

446
00:57:03,742 --> 00:57:05,819
In the time before time...

447
00:57:06,078 --> 00:57:09,612
...we were the slaves
and the humans...

448
00:57:10,457 --> 00:57:11,952
...were the masters.

449
00:57:13,586 --> 00:57:14,961
Impossible.

450
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:40,142
Break it.

451
00:57:59,464 --> 00:58:03,675
What you hold in your hand
is the proof of their power.

452
00:58:04,176 --> 00:58:06,086
Their power of invention.

453
00:58:06,346 --> 00:58:08,800
Their power of technology.

454
00:58:09,014 --> 00:58:14,175
Against this, our strength
means nothing.

455
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:22,725
This has the power
of a thousand spears.

456
00:58:23,403 --> 00:58:24,814
I warn you.

457
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:29,692
Their ingenuity goes hand in hand
with their cruelty.

458
00:58:31,286 --> 00:58:32,697
No creature...

459
00:58:32,913 --> 00:58:36,697
...is as devious, as violent.

460
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:40,084
You must find this human quickly.

461
00:58:40,337 --> 00:58:44,631
Do not let him get to Calima.

462
00:58:45,133 --> 00:58:46,841
The forbidden area?

463
00:58:48,428 --> 00:58:53,552
Calima holds the secret
to our true beginnings.

464
00:58:56,936 --> 00:58:58,596
Damn them.

465
00:58:59,105 --> 00:59:01,678
I will stop him, Father.

466
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:04,610
Damn them.

467
00:59:04,819 --> 00:59:07,985
Damn them all to hell.

468
00:59:49,362 --> 00:59:50,738
What is it?

469
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,860
They're to keep us away.

470
00:59:54,325 --> 00:59:56,781
What's on the other side?

471
00:59:56,995 --> 00:59:59,948
It leads to the sacred
ruins at Calima.

472
01:00:00,373 --> 01:00:04,537
- What is that?
- Calima? That's where, well...

473
01:00:04,794 --> 01:00:08,708
...according to our holy writings,
creation began.

474
01:00:09,591 --> 01:00:14,133
Where the Almighty
breathed life into Semos...

475
01:00:14,345 --> 01:00:16,385
...the first ape.

476
01:00:16,889 --> 01:00:19,890
In the time before time.

477
01:00:22,812 --> 01:00:25,598
It is where Semos will return.

478
01:00:25,814 --> 01:00:30,975
Most educated apes consider
such religious notions as fairy tales.

479
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:35,404
Metaphors we use to explain our origins.

480
01:00:35,616 --> 01:00:38,819
I doubt if there ever really was a Semos.

481
01:00:43,415 --> 01:00:46,202
My crew is there, so we're going.

482
01:00:46,668 --> 01:00:48,293
Doesn't he ever stop?

483
01:01:10,775 --> 01:01:13,562
- They're scared of water?
- We'll cross somewhere else.

484
01:01:15,822 --> 01:01:19,190
No time. Gets dark,
we're going right through.

485
01:01:26,624 --> 01:01:28,581
Semos smiles on me.

486
01:01:28,793 --> 01:01:30,203
I win again.

487
01:01:32,379 --> 01:01:36,045
You win too often.
What's hidden up your sleeve?

488
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:39,124
All of them.

489
01:01:41,305 --> 01:01:42,301
Cheater!

490
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:58,146
- Who's in charge here?!
- I am, sir!

491
01:01:59,281 --> 01:02:02,696
- I didn't know...
- This camp is a disgrace.

492
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:07,829
Some humans have escaped!
- If they come, we will crush them.

493
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,490
These humans are different.
They travel with apes.

494
01:02:16,088 --> 01:02:17,915
You find this amusing?

495
01:02:18,383 --> 01:02:19,794
No, sir.

496
01:02:20,009 --> 01:02:24,552
I'm assuming command.
This camp will be prepared!

497
01:02:47,036 --> 01:02:48,944
Just grab the reins.

498
01:02:49,162 --> 01:02:52,080
Hold tight. We're gonna
cross the river.

499
01:02:56,545 --> 01:03:00,495
Horses are great swimmers.
They'll carry you across.

500
01:03:06,555 --> 01:03:11,596
Good luck. Have a nice ride.
Leave me. I'll only slow you down.

501
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:14,644
- Letting him go?
- No. He'll ride with us.

502
01:03:14,896 --> 01:03:18,645
No, wait. Wait. This is suicide.

503
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,518
Only a human would think
that this could work.

504
01:03:41,588 --> 01:03:45,966
Hear my prayers, Semos,
father of all apes.

505
01:04:15,872 --> 01:04:17,995
No! No! I'm on your side!

506
01:04:25,297 --> 01:04:26,626
Come on!

507
01:05:39,412 --> 01:05:41,451
Come on! We have to swim.

508
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:43,404
Hey!

509
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:46,165
I won't let go of you!

510
01:05:46,419 --> 01:05:47,878
Come on!

511
01:06:29,877 --> 01:06:32,713
No, no, wait. There's no need now.

512
01:06:33,006 --> 01:06:34,584
- Says who?
- Them.

513
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:39,386
They tried to kill me like
I was nothing but a miserable...

514
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:42,628
Human?

515
01:07:17,758 --> 01:07:18,837
Ow.

516
01:07:19,092 --> 01:07:20,468
You're hurt.

517
01:07:21,052 --> 01:07:23,378
She was holding on pretty tight.

518
01:07:25,057 --> 01:07:29,635
The soldiers will cross downstream.
We should move quickly!

519
01:07:37,485 --> 01:07:40,321
They crossed the river.
- You didn't stop them?

520
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:44,447
Horses carried them.

521
01:07:48,913 --> 01:07:50,288
Horses?

522
01:07:51,124 --> 01:07:53,366
Our horses, sir.

523
01:08:30,412 --> 01:08:34,279
Forgive me, my friend.
I'm not angry with you.

524
01:08:34,499 --> 01:08:36,207
Father was taken from me.

525
01:08:36,793 --> 01:08:41,205
He was a great leader
and a direct descendant of Semos.

526
01:08:41,548 --> 01:08:44,917
Now it's time for you to lead.

527
01:08:46,844 --> 01:08:48,671
Form the divisions.

528
01:08:48,972 --> 01:08:50,086
Form divisions!

529
01:08:54,518 --> 01:08:55,977
Full battle ready!

530
01:08:59,315 --> 01:09:01,224
Sound the call to march!

531
01:09:32,305 --> 01:09:35,176
Tomorrow we reach Calima.

532
01:09:49,531 --> 01:09:51,902
He'll stay like that all night.

533
01:09:53,743 --> 01:09:55,368
A soldier, isn't he?

534
01:09:55,578 --> 01:09:59,623
A general. Well, he was
until he opposed Thade.

535
01:09:59,874 --> 01:10:03,871
When Thade ruined his career,
my father took him in.

536
01:10:05,838 --> 01:10:09,421
He was a great soldier.
Attar was his best pupil.

537
01:10:10,093 --> 01:10:12,298
Now they're enemies.

538
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:19,513
I'd like to see your world.

539
01:10:20,019 --> 01:10:24,811
They'd probably prod you and poke you
and throw you in a cage.

540
01:10:27,568 --> 01:10:29,276
You'd protect me.

541
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:45,866
They think you'll save them.

542
01:10:48,213 --> 01:10:52,293
After you meet your friends,
we'll never see you again.

543
01:10:54,094 --> 01:10:57,509
Well, I didn't promise them anything.

544
01:10:58,389 --> 01:10:59,634
No.

545
01:11:00,767 --> 01:11:03,518
You just dropped in from the stars.

546
01:12:17,717 --> 01:12:19,508
They're not here.

547
01:12:32,899 --> 01:12:34,096
Hello?

548
01:12:48,288 --> 01:12:50,364
They were never here.

549
01:12:52,918 --> 01:12:54,957
You said they'd come for us.

550
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:24,572
That's impossible.

551
01:13:45,802 --> 01:13:46,668
What is it?

552
01:13:48,305 --> 01:13:50,013
It's my ship.

553
01:13:51,766 --> 01:13:55,017
These ruins are
thousands of years old.

554
01:13:55,938 --> 01:13:58,344
I was just here a few days ago.

555
01:14:15,957 --> 01:14:18,993
<i>This is what I was
picking up. The Oberon.</i>

556
01:14:28,052 --> 01:14:29,844
What are you doing?

557
01:14:30,346 --> 01:14:33,596
It has a power source
that lasts forever.

558
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,445
Maybe I can access
the ship's visual log.

559
01:14:49,323 --> 01:14:52,323
Then I can figure out what happened.

560
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:03,035
<i>Mayday! Come in, guidance!</i>

561
01:15:03,294 --> 01:15:05,786
<i>Request instructions!
Going down!</i>

562
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:13,714
<i>We were searching for a pilot
in an electromagnetic storm.</i>

563
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:17,884
I got pushed forward through time.

564
01:15:18,935 --> 01:15:22,518
<i>We haven 't had any communications
since we crashed.</i>

565
01:15:23,397 --> 01:15:26,399
<i>This planet is uncharted, uninhabited.</i>

566
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:32,023
<i>The apes we've brought along with us
are a lot stronger...</i>

567
01:15:32,448 --> 01:15:33,729
<i>... and a lot smarter...</i>

568
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:36,115
<i>... than we ever imagined.</i>

569
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:45,125
<i>Apes are out of control.</i>

570
01:15:45,711 --> 01:15:47,253
<i>One male named Semos...</i>

571
01:15:48,339 --> 01:15:52,632
<i>... who I raised myself,
has taken over the group.</i>

572
01:15:52,843 --> 01:15:56,425
<i>We have weapons but I don 't
think we'll last long.</i>

573
01:15:56,638 --> 01:16:00,090
<i>Maybe I saw the truth,
but I wouldn't admit it.</i>

574
01:16:00,309 --> 01:16:02,217
<i>They were good students...</i>

575
01:16:13,363 --> 01:16:16,198
They're all dead
because they looked for me.

576
01:16:20,829 --> 01:16:23,284
We're alive because of you.

577
01:16:47,146 --> 01:16:48,177
Who are they?

578
01:16:48,564 --> 01:16:51,435
Your story is spreading.
They want to see...

579
01:16:51,692 --> 01:16:54,361
...this human who defies the apes.

580
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,898
Send them all back.

581
01:16:57,114 --> 01:17:00,399
Where? They left their homes
to be with you.

582
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,231
I saw them.

583
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:16,811
How many?

584
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,017
As far as I could see.

585
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:24,026
Thade has all his legions.
The senate's capitulated.

586
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:27,155
He answers to no one now.

587
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:36,580
You're gonna have to get your people
out of here.

588
01:18:37,337 --> 01:18:39,044
They won't listen to me.

589
01:18:53,185 --> 01:18:55,309
This is a fight we can't win.

590
01:18:56,439 --> 01:18:58,645
Break up and scatter.

591
01:18:59,316 --> 01:19:02,187
I'll draw them off.
I'm who they want.

592
01:19:04,029 --> 01:19:05,689
All right? Come on!

593
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,615
Let's go!

594
01:19:08,033 --> 01:19:09,492
Let's go!

595
01:19:12,704 --> 01:19:13,784
Come on!

596
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:26,879
You've gotta make them understand.

597
01:19:27,135 --> 01:19:29,508
It's over. No help is coming.

598
01:19:37,478 --> 01:19:38,889
You came.

599
01:20:07,133 --> 01:20:10,466
Stop!
Come closer and identify yourself!

600
01:20:15,682 --> 01:20:18,304
How dare you show your face here?!

601
01:20:19,353 --> 01:20:22,270
It is not my decision.

602
01:20:30,488 --> 01:20:32,695
I wish to speak to Thade.

603
01:21:11,779 --> 01:21:13,238
Why have you come?

604
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:26,083
To be with you.

605
01:21:38,889 --> 01:21:40,004
A trade?

606
01:21:40,348 --> 01:21:44,049
You're proposing that?
Yourself for the humans?

607
01:21:47,605 --> 01:21:51,354
Even when you were a child,
you took in stray humans.

608
01:21:51,568 --> 01:21:54,105
Your family indulged you.

609
01:21:58,616 --> 01:22:00,324
Look what you've become.

610
01:22:01,911 --> 01:22:03,405
I've been...

611
01:22:04,706 --> 01:22:05,820
...mistaken.

612
01:22:08,918 --> 01:22:10,412
Forgive me.

613
01:22:28,228 --> 01:22:31,146
So you want to be human?

614
01:22:38,696 --> 01:22:40,523
Then wear their mark!

615
01:22:48,665 --> 01:22:49,780
Let her return.

616
01:22:50,709 --> 01:22:53,875
She'll die with her friends tomorrow.

617
01:23:34,585 --> 01:23:39,745
<i>We were searching for a pilot
in an electromagnetic storm.</i>

618
01:23:40,173 --> 01:23:43,709
<i>We haven 't had any communications
since we crashed.</i>

619
01:23:43,927 --> 01:23:45,587
I'm so sorry.

620
01:23:48,181 --> 01:23:50,802
I'm responsible for all of this.

621
01:23:51,309 --> 01:23:53,516
And I'm never going home.

622
01:23:55,856 --> 01:23:57,598
Just like them.

623
01:24:00,694 --> 01:24:02,852
<i>The apes are out of control.</i>

624
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,288
I can't go home, either.

625
01:24:19,045 --> 01:24:21,002
Maybe we're not so different.

626
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:26,959
No. We're very different.

627
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:32,716
You care about everybody but yourself.

628
01:24:33,851 --> 01:24:38,263
Doesn't matter. Apes, humans.
My planet, your planet.

629
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,731
The universe rewards cruelty with power.

630
01:24:43,026 --> 01:24:44,189
No.

631
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:49,270
Not always. Not if we fight back.

632
01:24:54,872 --> 01:24:56,910
I'm just not sure how.

633
01:25:04,631 --> 01:25:06,707
Better take care of that.

634
01:25:16,809 --> 01:25:19,846
I respect your courage.

635
01:25:20,772 --> 01:25:24,639
But my advice to you is
to put that away...

636
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:27,602
...and head for the mountains.

637
01:26:12,864 --> 01:26:14,607
There's one possibility.

638
01:26:15,616 --> 01:26:18,571
I want those people behind the ship.

639
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:22,202
- Not hiding, they need to be seen.
- And us?

640
01:26:22,623 --> 01:26:25,494
You'll be in front. You're the bait.

641
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:28,497
- I won't move.
- You won't be there.

642
01:26:28,754 --> 01:26:33,250
- I can do this!
- I know. I need you back with them.

643
01:26:35,052 --> 01:26:36,463
We got one shot.

644
01:26:41,976 --> 01:26:43,304
Listen!

645
01:26:43,728 --> 01:26:45,186
I got an idea.

646
01:26:45,438 --> 01:26:49,269
We may have a chance.
I need you behind the ship.

647
01:26:52,153 --> 01:26:54,358
Hey, we can win this.

648
01:26:54,571 --> 01:26:57,857
It's been done before. On my planet.

649
01:26:58,659 --> 01:27:01,992
Men have done amazing things in history.

650
01:27:02,204 --> 01:27:04,161
That history belongs to you.

651
01:27:05,873 --> 01:27:09,539
Sometimes even a few
can make a difference, okay?

652
01:27:10,796 --> 01:27:15,837
This is the day you've waited for!
You get to stand up to the apes!

653
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:18,505
Leo!

654
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:24,844
You know you can't defeat Thade's army.

655
01:27:26,519 --> 01:27:30,387
We might confuse them.
It could give us a chance.

656
01:27:32,775 --> 01:27:37,734
You don't understand Thade.
He'll keep coming for you.

657
01:27:37,989 --> 01:27:39,447
No matter what.

658
01:27:39,949 --> 01:27:41,941
That's what I'm counting on.

659
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:26,237
Get behind the ship!

660
01:28:26,536 --> 01:28:29,323
Get children behind the ship!

661
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,665
Come on, move! Now!

662
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:54,646
- Let me go.
- No.

663
01:28:54,855 --> 01:28:57,809
- Let me prove I can help!
- I need you here.

664
01:28:58,066 --> 01:28:59,858
Help clear them back.

665
01:29:24,342 --> 01:29:25,967
- What?
- I'm part of this!

666
01:29:26,177 --> 01:29:27,802
- Get back!
- No!

667
01:29:28,055 --> 01:29:29,465
I'm staying!

668
01:29:39,566 --> 01:29:41,771
Send in the first wave.

669
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:49,188
Here they come.

670
01:29:51,369 --> 01:29:52,649
Now!

671
01:30:05,883 --> 01:30:07,627
Oh, God.

672
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:36,651
Come on.

673
01:30:56,182 --> 01:30:57,213
Jesus!

674
01:31:05,441 --> 01:31:06,851
Come on.

675
01:32:00,911 --> 01:32:02,074
Wait.

676
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,343
Now! Go!

677
01:32:39,115 --> 01:32:42,366
With that weapon,
we cannot defeat them!

678
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,041
I'm tired of this human.

679
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:15,994
No! Wait!

680
01:35:17,812 --> 01:35:21,263
My fight is with Thade, not you!

681
01:35:21,523 --> 01:35:24,193
Then your fight is with me!

682
01:38:15,235 --> 01:38:16,894
Semos.

683
01:38:50,811 --> 01:38:53,598
Pericles. A better landing than me.

684
01:38:57,985 --> 01:39:00,690
Sir, the prophecy is true.

685
01:39:00,905 --> 01:39:03,442
Semos has returned to us.

686
01:39:06,743 --> 01:39:07,906
Come on.

687
01:39:08,870 --> 01:39:11,955
Let's go explain evolution
to the monkeys.

688
01:42:31,609 --> 01:42:33,686
He'll turn us into slaves!

689
01:42:33,987 --> 01:42:35,018
Kill him!

690
01:42:35,322 --> 01:42:38,322
Listen. This is where you're from.

691
01:42:38,533 --> 01:42:43,823
We brought you here. It's true.
We lived in peace together. Semos...

692
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,907
...killed everybody.

693
01:42:51,754 --> 01:42:52,917
He's lying!

694
01:42:53,506 --> 01:42:54,621
Help me!

695
01:42:55,091 --> 01:42:58,460
My friend, kill him!

696
01:43:06,435 --> 01:43:09,056
Everything I have believed is a lie!

697
01:43:09,479 --> 01:43:13,394
You and your family have betrayed us!

698
01:43:13,943 --> 01:43:16,729
I won't help you anymore.

699
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:26,995
Ari...

700
01:45:18,105 --> 01:45:19,136
You okay?

701
01:45:19,898 --> 01:45:21,690
You came home.

702
01:45:21,984 --> 01:45:25,435
It's safe.
You can come out now.

703
01:45:28,198 --> 01:45:29,823
What? It's over?

704
01:45:30,117 --> 01:45:33,320
I was just getting ready
to make my move.

705
01:45:44,047 --> 01:45:46,964
We'll leave the graves unmarked.

706
01:45:47,175 --> 01:45:51,304
No one who comes will be able
to tell apes from humans.

707
01:45:51,512 --> 01:45:53,304
They'll be mourned together...

708
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:57,557
...as it should be, from now on.

709
01:46:10,115 --> 01:46:12,153
Take good care of him, okay?

710
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:16,616
I can promise you
I won't put him in a cage.

711
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:36,555
It found the storm
that brought me here.

712
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:38,801
You know...

713
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:42,222
...it would mean much to everyone...

714
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:44,270
...if you would stay.

715
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:49,609
Would mean much to me.

716
01:46:50,778 --> 01:46:52,652
I have to leave now.

717
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:54,946
I have to get back.

718
01:47:00,205 --> 01:47:03,490
You know, one day,
they'll tell a story...

719
01:47:03,708 --> 01:47:07,836
...about a human who came
from the stars...

720
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:10,331
...and changed our world.

721
01:47:13,259 --> 01:47:16,176
Some will say it was just
a fairy tale...

722
01:47:19,307 --> 01:47:21,596
...that he was never real.

723
01:47:24,103 --> 01:47:25,930
But I'll know.

724
01:47:47,543 --> 01:47:48,373
Oh.

725
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:49,741
Keep it.

726
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:53,506
You know, I'd like to thank you...

727
01:47:53,715 --> 01:47:59,136
...for opening my eyes to a brave new
world of trade with the humans.

728
01:48:00,430 --> 01:48:01,840
Yeah, no problem.

729
01:48:02,223 --> 01:48:04,382
Farewell, spaceman.

730
01:48:04,934 --> 01:48:09,560
All right, kids, who wants
to buy some aspirin?

731
01:48:21,492 --> 01:48:23,200
Maybe you'll come back.

732
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:44,584
<i>Z.D. C. Air Route Traffic
Control to unidentified aircraft.</i>

733
01:50:46,592 --> 01:50:49,166
<i>Unidentified craft, do you copy?</i>

734
01:50:49,595 --> 01:50:55,016
<i>- Copy that.
- You're entering restricted airspace.</i>

735
01:50:55,559 --> 01:50:58,310
<i>- Permission to land!
- You're off-target. Abort!</i>

736
01:51:00,355 --> 01:51:02,229
I can't!

737
01:52:23,978 --> 01:52:25,936
Stay where you are!

738
01:52:26,147 --> 01:52:28,140
Show your hands!

739
01:52:44,707 --> 01:52:46,499
Keep your hands up!
