00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,477
<i>Sue, don't misunderstand
me, please.</i>

3
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,832
Sue, I'm not complaining
about your work.

4
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,960
I have your latest piece
right here in front of me

5
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,753
and it's terrific, it's great.

6
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,948
It's just that you were
due back here yesterday.

7
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,467
Yeah, but Richard, there's one
more story I just have to do.

8
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,052
<i>There's always one more story.</i>

9
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,121
No, but would you listen to this?

10
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,000
Last month this guy in
the Northern Territory

11
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,809
was attacked by a crocodile.

12
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,477
The thing bit his leg right off,

13
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,081
left him there to die
100 miles from nowhere.

14
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,732
A week later, he crawls
out of the bush,

15
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,380
gets patched up and disappears.

16
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,444
<i>No interviews,
no pictures, nothing.</i>

17
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,388
- So?
<i>- I tracked him down.</i>

18
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,727
He runs a safari business out of
somewhere called Walkabout Creek.

19
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,179
<i>And his name...</i>

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,681
<i>Get this...</i>

21
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,310
Michael J. "Crocodile" Dundee.

22
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,877
Sue, even if this
thing is for real,

23
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,776
it could take you weeks
to nail him down.

24
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:29,986
<i>Will you trust me?</i>

25
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,966
I already made
arrangements to meet him.

26
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,801
I've got a chopper meeting
the plane at Darwin.

27
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,119
I'll be there tonight.

28
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,743
Well...

29
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,749
Okay.

30
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,268
I really miss you, darling.

31
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,461
<i>I miss you, too, honey.</i>

32
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,520
<i>Take care now.</i>

33
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,373
Don't worry. I'm a New Yorker.

34
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,359
Hi.

35
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,450
Walter Reilly, Never Never Safaris.

36
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,847
I'm Mr. Dundee's business partner.

37
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,140
Nice to meet you, Mr. Reilly.

38
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,434
Oh, please, call me Walter.

39
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,629
We're pretty informal in the bush.

40
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,928
No, uh, let me.

41
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,302
There you go.

42
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,308
- You all right?
- Yes.

43
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,631
I'm sorry that Mr. Dundee isn't
here himself to meet you.

44
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,782
But he is here in town. Somewhere.

45
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,147
Welcome to Walkabout Creek.

46
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,079
Hmm.

47
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:10,017
Oh, I took the liberty of
booking you into our hotel.

48
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,811
I trust that's in order?

49
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,334
Sounds just fine.

50
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,461
There's just one other thing.

51
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,607
Uh...

52
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:21,339
You did say that you were
prepared to pay the $2,500?

53
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,006
Absolutely.

54
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,518
And I will see where he was
attacked and how he survived?

55
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,140
Miss, I assure you, you're gonna
spend a few wonderful days here.

56
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,084
Come on, fellas. Five bucks,
anyone who can make Donk spill it.

57
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,758
So tell me, what's the
sideshow all about?

58
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,194
Oh, that's just the boys
having fun and games.

59
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,696
You see, Donk's never
spilled a drop.

60
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,677
- We're a pretty tough breed up here.
- Mmm-hmm.

61
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,266
Ooh!

62
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,788
And your Mr. Dundee, does he...

63
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,937
No, no, no. No, no,
he's very reserved.

64
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,231
He's a legend up here.

65
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,671
I mean, there he was out there
doing a quiet spot of fishing,

66
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,615
when all of a sudden... Bang!

67
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,110
This giant crocodile came up,

68
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,738
turned him over, bit
half his leg off,

69
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,331
dragged him down under.

70
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,035
Killed it, of course.

71
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:38,882
I mean, any normal man would have
just turned up his toes and died.

72
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:44,137
But not our Mick.  No.

73
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,803
Hundreds of miles...

74
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,059
Snake-infested swamps...

75
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,392
On his hands and knees...

76
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,316
He crawled right into Katherine.

77
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,209
Straight past the hospital

78
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,109
and into the first pub for a beer.

79
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,993
That story's getting better
every time you tell it, Wally.

80
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:16,457
No, we handle ourselves pretty
well up here in the bush, Miss.

81
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,497
But if you're talking legend...

82
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,051
Oh, my God!

83
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,340
Two beers, Ida.

84
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,409
One for me, one for me mate.

85
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,071
"One for your mate,"
you mad bugger.

86
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,080
Oh, hang on.

87
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,504
I'm sorry if that
frightened you, Miss.

88
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,165
You see, it's stuffed.

89
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,794
Him and me both, Wal.

90
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,937
Michael J. "Crocodile" Dundee.

91
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,349
Never Never Safaris.

92
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,360
Yeah. Um, never go outwith us,

93
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,189
if you do, you'll never
come back. Right, Wal?

94
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,028
Sue Charlton, <i>Newsday</i>.

95
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,533
Yeah, I thought you might be.

96
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,934
Uh, here, Wal. Mind Cyril for me

97
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,165
while I dance with this
charming young lady.

98
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,232
Legend has it a crocodile
took half your leg off.

99
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,959
Uh, well, a slight exaggeration.

100
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,312
Um...

101
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,238
More like a love bite, really.

102
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,327
Anyhow, enough about me leg.

103
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,780
Let me tell you about
the rest of me.

104
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:20,809
Up north in the Never Never, where
the land is harsh and bare,

105
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,604
lives a mighty hunter
named Mick Dundee,

106
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,878
who can dance like Fred Astaire.

107
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,542
Smooth shag, eh?

108
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,652
What did you say the
name of this clown was?

109
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,845
Mick Dundee.

110
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,638
He's the bloke that was grabbed
by a croc on the Rapid River.

111
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,181
What was he doing up there?

112
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,855
It's full of crocs. What do
you reckon he was doing?

113
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,937
Just a bloody poacher, eh?

114
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,667
Listen, you do understand

115
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,941
I want you to take me out
where you were attacked,

116
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,444
show me how you survived.

117
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,675
Oh, well, I don't know, just
the two of us out there alone?

118
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,296
I've got me reputation
to think about.

119
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,830
Hey, Dundee.

120
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,891
Where can a man shoot a few
crocs around here, eh?

121
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,084
How would I know, shit-for-brains?

122
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,175
Just relax.

123
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,282
Now, come on, Dundee.

124
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,118
Every man and his dog
in the joint knows

125
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,517
you're nothing but a
bloody croc poacher.

126
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,077
You better get your
men out of here.

127
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,592
Oh, sorry about that.

128
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,663
But I won't have anyone using bad
language in front of a lady.

129
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,498
Bad language?

130
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,665
Don't come back neither!

131
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,338
What was he saying about
you being a poacher?

132
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,050
Uh, he was just trying to
get a bite, that's all.

133
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,509
Donk, tonight's me lucky night.

134
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,280
You want to have a hit at the guts?

135
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,073
Here's a go, fellas.
Good on you, Mick.

136
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,973
Come on, guys, put
your money on me.

137
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,071
Come on, Mick.

138
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,747
Give me a kiss, Donk.

139
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,303
I'm sorry. He's not
normally like this.

140
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,135
I do apologize.
It's just the drink.

141
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,350
You mean there's a serious
side to him? Hmm.

142
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,304
I can hardly wait.

143
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,637
Uh, comfortable, Miss?

144
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,222
Wonderful country out here.

145
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,745
We think so.

146
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,403
Well, I hope you're not gonna
be the strong, silent type.

147
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,506
- Me?
- Reluctant to talk about yourself?

148
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,324
No. Favorite subject.

149
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,018
Great. Why "Crocodile"?

150
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,971
Wal's idea.

151
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,814
He reckons it makes me more
colorful for the tourist business.

152
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,980
How old are you?

153
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,421
Don't know.

154
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,839
Uh, what year is this?

155
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,132
You don't know?

156
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,885
Um, time doesn't mean
much up here, Miss.

157
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,930
You see, um, the Aborigines
don't have calendars.

158
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,182
I was raised by the local tribe.

159
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,935
I asked one of the tribal
elders one day when I was born.

160
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,380
And he said, "In the summertime."

161
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,352
And is there a
Mrs. Crocodile Dundee?

162
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,629
I was sort of married once.

163
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,483
- Nice girl. Good cook. Big...
- Mick!

164
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,073
Anyway, I went off on walkabout.

165
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,041
When I came back, she'd gone.

166
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,752
A walkabout?

167
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,270
That's an Aboriginal habit.

168
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:38,421
It means to, uh, wander around
and discover new places.

169
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,295
How long were you gone?

170
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,009
Couple months.

171
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,388
Try 18.

172
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,809
And she didn't wait?

173
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,302
Strange girl.

174
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,189
Yeah.

175
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,618
Out of the way, dopey!

176
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,631
Jesus...

177
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,936
That was amazing.

178
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,222
Mind over matter.

179
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,974
Old bushman's trick.

180
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,708
All right, Miss. All ashore.

181
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,401
Now, I'm going to leave you
in Mick's capable hands,

182
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,676
and I'll meet you at the Echo
Billabong on Wednesday.

183
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,699
2:20. We better get started.

184
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,634
2:20.

185
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,238
Yeah. Yes. That's the way
that we do it in the bush.

186
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,472
Uh, don't you worry, Miss.

187
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,167
He's the best bushman
in the territory.

188
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,544
Best pupil I ever had.

189
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,542
You ready, lady?

190
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,503
Ready as I'll ever be.

191
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,485
Right, well, uh, till Wednesday.

192
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,213
- Cheerio.
- Wednesday.

193
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,060
- What's today, Wal?
- Monday.

194
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,227
Doesn't know.

195
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,028
Doesn't care.

196
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,277
Lucky bastard.

197
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,245
- You okay, lady?
- Oh, I'm fine.

198
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,176
It's only about another
hour to the river,

199
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,719
but you being a sheila,

200
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,672
it'll probably take two.

201
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,092
Well, I'll just do the best I can.

202
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,765
Yeah.

203
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,352
The water was running 20 foot up
the bank during the wet season.

204
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,290
Here's what's left of me boat.

205
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,613
Now you can see where
he sunk his teeth in.

206
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,182
My God.

207
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,638
How big was it?

208
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,599
Uh, 16, 18 foot, maybe.

209
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,809
And you were out here
hunting crocodiles in that?

210
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,688
Nah, that's illegal.
I was just fishing.

211
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,988
How did you get away?

212
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,930
Uh, see, crocs don't
like fresh meat.

213
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,749
He wasn't trying to
eat me on the spot.

214
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,935
He just wanted grab hold of me and
take me down for a death roll.

215
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,128
A death roll?

216
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,215
Yeah. See, a croc will grab you,

217
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,668
take you down to the
bottom of the water,

218
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,714
and roll you over and over and
over till you stop kicking.

219
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,683
Then he'll take you away to
his meat safe somewhere.

220
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,019
A rock ledge, log,

221
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,106
down under the water and
jam you under it...

222
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,665
Tenderize you a bit.

223
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,938
Good eating.

224
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,254
Anyway, he wasn't happy
with the grip he had on me,

225
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,362
so he let go to get a better
one, and I talked him out of it.

226
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,909
Talked?

227
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,419
And you were just out here fishing?

228
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,596
Well, a barramundi's
a bloody big fish.

229
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,721
It'll be getting dark soon.

230
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,852
I'll take you to where I
camped the first night.

231
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,350
You married?

232
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,623
Was once...

233
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,289
To the original rebel.

234
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,415
What happened?

235
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,002
You name it, we marched...

236
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,926
Anti-nuke, women's lib,
save the whales.

237
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,824
He's probably marching right now
for the gay Nazis or something.

238
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,927
Hmm. Sounds like a prize ratbag.

239
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,013
Oh, he meant well.

240
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,106
Haven't you ever
protested anything?

241
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,894
Sure. Every time I get
thrown out of the pub.

242
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,024
Come on, I'm serious.

243
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,339
I mean, where would someone
like you stand on,

244
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,008
say, the nuclear debate?

245
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,827
What do you think
about the arms race?

246
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,366
None of my business.

247
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,786
None of your business?

248
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,367
How can you say that?

249
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,289
It's everybody's business.

250
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,793
Got to have an opinion.
Got to have a voice.

251
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,466
Who's going to hear it out here?

252
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,507
Okay.

253
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,282
Something closer to home.

254
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,227
Uh... The Aborigines.

255
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,806
What do you think about their
claims to get the land back?

256
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,309
Ah, well, you see,

257
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,485
Aborigines don't own the land.

258
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,775
They belong to it.

259
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,573
It's like their mother.

260
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,782
See those rocks sticking up there?

261
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,161
Been standing up there
for 600 million years.

262
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,996
Still be there when
you and I are gone.

263
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,628
So arguing over who owns them

264
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,051
is like two fleas arguing over
who owns the dog they live on.

265
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,570
You see, uh...

266
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,822
Uh...

267
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,074
Aborigines, well, like
all God's creatures,

268
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,848
they just want the right to

269
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,555
roam across the earth
and be left in peace.

270
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,857
It's that...

271
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,863
Oh, it's a king brown.

272
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:25,952
Poisonous?

273
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,579
Oh, yeah. Deadly.

274
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,915
Not bad eating,
but always give me gas.

275
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,541
Uh, listen, are there any
more of those around?

276
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,606
Oh, maybe the odd
one late at night.

277
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,880
But stick close to me,
you'll be all right.

278
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,467
Yeah, you're probably right, a
man should have an opinion.

279
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,912
- I... Shh!
- What?

280
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,125
Hmm. Thought I heard something.

281
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,435
No, it's nothing.

282
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,913
Good night.

283
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,590
Mick?

284
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,647
It's only me.

285
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,025
Dangerous bastards.

286
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,694
It's those city cowboys.

287
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,993
What are you going to do?

288
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,428
Nothing. Why?

289
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,874
Why? They're shooting these
poor kangaroos for fun.

290
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,713
There's no law against that.

291
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,637
Keep your head down.

292
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,177
Stay here.

293
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,974
Hey. Ah, I need a piss.

294
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:05,545
I need a piss!

295
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,398
Yeah, and a straighter rifle.

296
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,192
You're as useless as
tits on a bull, Duffy!

297
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,265
Shh! Shut up, you guys.

298
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,367
- Hey, Trevor.
- What?

299
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,268
Trevor, get the spotlight
over here, mate.

300
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,246
- Eh?
- The spotlight!

301
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,480
Can't you see where you're aiming?

302
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,833
Shut up!

303
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:33,300
Not on me, you silly
bugger, on the bushes.

304
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,096
Hey...

305
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,307
Hey, look at this
big cheeky bugger.

306
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,061
Hey! It's got a gun!

307
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,566
Shit!

308
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,074
Get out of here! Get going!

309
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,547
Whoo-hoo!

310
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,213
Good one, skippy.

311
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,153
Despite the rugged
beauty of this land,

312
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,260
there's a sort of strange
emptiness about it.

313
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,160
A feeling of being so alone.

314
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,159
Yeah, but you're not alone.

315
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,493
I'm here, aren't I?

316
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,921
Yeah, but...

317
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,022
I think I know how you
must have felt...

318
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,593
Or how I'd feel if I
were out here alone.

319
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,921
You... Out here alone?

320
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,381
That's a joke.

321
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,675
A city girl like you...

322
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,118
You wouldn't last
five minutes, love.

323
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,846
This is man's country out here.

324
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,901
That's right. I'm only a sheila.

325
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,039
We're heading for that
escarpment today, right?

326
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,450
Yeah.

327
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,414
Okay.

328
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,128
See you there this afternoon.

329
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:10,877
Hey!

330
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,926
If you're gonna go,
take the gun with you.

331
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,804
If you get into trouble, fire
a couple of shots in the air.

332
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,064
That's the dangerous end.

333
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,915
So it is.

334
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,133
Hmm.

335
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,800
It's all right. It's over.

336
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,015
Hey. Hey.

337
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,471
I got you. I got you.

338
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,653
Is it dead?

339
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,059
Well, if it isn't, I'm gonna
have a hell of a job

340
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,582
skinning the bastard.

341
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,011
Well, you were right.

342
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,871
Definitely no place
for a city girl.

343
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,349
Ah, I don't know.

344
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:24,585
From what Wal's told me, living in
the city can be just as dangerous.

345
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,609
Haven't you ever lived in a city?

346
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,357
Never been to a city.

347
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,033
- You're kidding.
- No.

348
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,243
Cities are crowded, right?

349
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,826
If I went and lived in some
city, I'd only make it worse.

350
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,870
Here. Try this.

351
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,773
Do you want me to
have a look at that?

352
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:46,982
It's just a scratch.

353
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,901
Yeah, well, a scratch can
turn septic out here.

354
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,800
Give us a look. It's all right.

355
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,391
Shh.

356
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,059
Now what?

357
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,734
Oh, Christ. It's like
living with Davy Crockett.

358
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,609
Mick?

359
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,789
Mick.

360
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,820
Ah, Mick.

361
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,488
You frightened shit out of me.

362
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,574
So I ought to, mate.
Sneaking up on a man

363
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,928
when he's rendering
first-aid to a lady.

364
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,060
Ah. Is that what you were doing?

365
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,167
It's all right.
It's a mate of mine.

366
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,020
Neville Bell. Sue Charlton.

367
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,564
G'day, Sue.

368
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,987
What are you doing wandering
around here in the scrub, Nev?

369
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,790
I'm on my way to a corroboree
over at the Jabba.

370
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,324
It's a bloody drag,

371
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,669
but still my dad get angry
if I don't show up.

372
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:09,670
See, Nev's a real city boy,
but his dad's a tribal elder.

373
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,132
Oh, no. You can't
take my photograph.

374
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,473
Oh. I'm sorry. You believe it
will take your spirit away.

375
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,593
No. You got lens cap on.

376
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,316
Crikey, Mick. I better get going.

377
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,988
- Nice to meet you, Sue.
- Bye, Nev.

378
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,690
I'll catch up with you, Nev.

379
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,825
What's happening?

380
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,871
I better go with Nev and have
a chat with the Pintinjarra.

381
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,160
Oh, can I come?

382
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,931
No way.

383
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,251
Women are strictly taboo
at these turnouts.

384
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,131
How does he find his
way in the dark?

385
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,001
He thinks his way.

386
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,388
A lot of people believe
that they're telepathic.

387
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,218
Ooh!

388
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,391
Oh, I hate the bush.

389
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:29,602
How did you know?

390
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,944
Are you telepathic?

391
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,616
Nah. Common sense.

392
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,328
You're a woman. You're a reporter.

393
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,997
That makes you the biggest
busybody in the world.

394
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,288
I can live with that.

395
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,166
That croc was gonna eat me alive.

396
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,262
Oh, I wouldn't hold
that against him.

397
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,595
Same thought crossed
my mind once or twice.

398
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,978
Good night, Mick.

399
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,101
Hmm.

400
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,314
Of course, it took me a
week to crawl this far.

401
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,799
I thought I was a goner.

402
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,119
Said to meself, "Mick, old son",

403
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,242
"find yourself a nice,
comfortable spot"

404
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,160
"and lay down and die."

405
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,498
Weren't you afraid?

406
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,034
Of dying? Nah.

407
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,828
I read the Bible once.

408
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,880
You know God and Jesus
and all them apostles?

409
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,092
They were all fishermen,
just like me.

410
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:42,178
Yep. Straight to heaven
for Mick Dundee.

411
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,632
Yep.

412
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,181
Me and God...

413
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,936
We'd be mates.

414
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,572
This is Echo Lake.

415
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,329
I reckon this place saved me life.

416
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,434
That's mineral water.

417
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,912
Means no crocs.

418
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,540
More tucker here than you
could poke a stick at.

419
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:19,757
Tucker?

420
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,843
Food. You hungry?

421
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,383
- Starving.
- I'll get lunch.

422
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,104
How do you like your goanna?
Medium? Well done?

423
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,565
You don't really
expect me to eat that?

424
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,105
Yeah, it's great. Here,
try some of those yams.

425
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,403
Try the grubs and the sugar ants.

426
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,383
Just bite the end off.
They're really sweet.

427
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,031
Black fellas love them.

428
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,834
What about you?
Aren't you having any?

429
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,081
Me?

430
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,584
Ah, Well...

431
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,214
You can live on it...

432
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,592
But it tastes like shit.

433
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:15,831
Mick.

434
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,958
When I go back, why
don't you come with me?

435
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,418
What for?

436
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,581
Well, it would make a great
wrap to the story...

437
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,841
You in New York City.

438
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:28,886
Oh.

439
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,947
For a minute there I thought
you were making a pass at me.

440
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,675
Well, I might have been.

441
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,397
Would you mind?

442
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,966
Bloody Wally.

443
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,360
He's only been here a dozen times.

444
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,929
He's probably lost.

445
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,406
Did you, uh...

446
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,405
You got wind or something, Wal?

447
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,670
I want Mick to come back
to New York with me.

448
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,884
Mick? In a big city?

449
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,504
No chance.

450
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,384
Paper would pay.

451
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,220
Well, a man should
broaden his horizons.

452
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,645
Everything Okay?

453
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,276
Oh, yeah. No worries.

454
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,422
Jesus Christ!

455
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,074
Sue!

456
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,781
Sue!

457
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,537
Sue.

458
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,293
G'day, mate!

459
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,375
You look absolutely stunning.

460
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,509
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

461
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,719
Here, let me get this.

462
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:21,847
Oh...

463
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,411
Where's the man from the backwoods?

464
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,080
Oh, God. We got
separated in customs.

465
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,248
He almost started a riot

466
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,317
when they wanted to look
through his suitcase.

467
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,857
Ah, there he is.

468
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,153
So, that's Jungle Jim.

469
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,271
New York City, Mr. Dundee.

470
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,561
Home to seven million people.

471
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,045
That's incredible.

472
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:18,737
Imagine seven million people
all wanting to live together.

473
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,616
Yep. New York must be the
friendliest place on earth.

474
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,176
G'day!

475
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,382
Mick Dundee from
Australia. How are you?

476
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,427
I'm fine. How are you? I think...

477
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,059
Good. Just came down
for a couple of days.

478
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,435
Probably see you around.

479
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,434
Fine. We went from there...

480
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,278
I don't know, I think...

481
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,258
Thank you, Gus.

482
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,928
- You'll take care of the luggage?
- Yes, sir.

483
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:30,934
That's it.

484
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,750
Hey. Thanks for the lift, mate.

485
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,148
No problem.

486
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,312
What tribe are you, Gus?

487
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,946
Tribe?

488
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,233
Man, I ain't from no tribe.

489
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,802
You're a black feller, aren't you?

490
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:46,029
Last time I looked.

491
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,575
No one in our tribe's got
a flash car like this.

492
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,456
You must be doing all right, eh?

493
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,964
I'll get a cab back to the office.

494
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,819
Do you want to eat
somewhere special tonight?

495
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,718
Well, I thought
Tucano's would be nice.

496
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,448
Tucano's. 7:30?

497
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:07,846
Mmm. Great.

498
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,851
- Bye.
- Okay.

499
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,346
Table for three.

500
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,339
Sir?

501
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,885
No worries.

502
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,823
Well, what do you think?

503
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,327
Oh, it's a bit rough,
but I'll manage.

504
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,574
Hey, how many of us
are staying here?

505
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,950
Just you.

506
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,077
I've got my own apartment downtown.

507
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,990
Oh, sorry, Mick Dundee.
I didn't catch the name.

508
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,560
- Angelo.
- Pleased to meet you, Angelo.

509
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,851
I got it. Here you go.

510
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,112
Got to pay for the room
in advance, have we?

511
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:45,319
You're in m town now, trust me.

512
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:53,998
Yeah. Can I get the direct
dialing code for Australia?

513
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,958
You should be comfortable.
Everything's here.

514
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,543
There's a TV if you get bored.

515
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,128
Ah, television.

516
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:10,965
Yeah, I saw that at Darkie
Johnson's place years ago.

517
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,266
Yep, that's what I saw.

518
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,147
Right. Okay, thanks.

519
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:31,759
So, I'm writing down Wally's
number and my office number.

520
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,329
Hey, Sue, come here, look at this!

521
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,963
Some nitwit's put two
dunnies in here.

522
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,000
One dunny, one bidet.

523
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,298
- Bidet?
- Mmm.

524
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:54,099
It's for... After you... You know.

525
00:49:58,204 --> 00:49:59,851
You figure it out.

526
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,150
See you at seven.

527
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:04,727
Yeah.

528
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,565
For washing your backside, right?

529
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,082
G'day.

530
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,556
G'day.

531
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,975
G'day.

532
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,069
- Hello.
- G'day.

533
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,571
G'day.

534
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:55,675
Sorry.

535
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,263
G'day. Ooops!

536
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,645
Shit.

537
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,883
- Take it easy, Mick.
- Thanks, mate.

538
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:16,836
- Ta.
- Bye.

539
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,847
- G'day.
- Yes, sir.

540
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,319
Good evening. Follow me, please.

541
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,112
- Hello.
- Um.

542
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,747
Sorry we're late.

543
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,492
- Been waiting long?
- Oh, I arrived early,

544
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,018
eager to spend time with my girl.

545
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:54,230
So, what are we drinking?
Uh, two vodka martinis,

546
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,107
and what's yours, crocodile?

547
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,757
Yeah, I'll have two of
those, and a beer, thanks.

548
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,048
Could you send them through
to our table, Matt?

549
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,513
You have been here awhile.

550
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,690
Let's eat.

551
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,960
Now this will be quite a
novelty for you, Mick.

552
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:19,782
Eating something without
having to kill it first.

553
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,859
Shall we?

554
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,261
- Ah, Roberto.
- Good evening, Mr. Mason.

555
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,536
I can see you got some
friends. Follow me, please.

556
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,797
Thank you.

557
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:47,434
You know I had almost forgotten
what a sexy-looking lady you are.

558
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,036
I'll gonna have to find a
way of keeping you in town.

559
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,871
Oh, I think we can
work something out.

560
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,098
Really? Yes, what?

561
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,820
Listen, uh, you two
should really be alone.

562
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:02,191
Sorry, Mick. It's just that we haven't
seen each other in six weeks.

563
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,758
Well, that's all the more reason...

564
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:06,928
Oh, there's no way I'd leave you alone
on your first night in New York.

565
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:09,282
Richard and I want you with us.

566
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,371
Right. Absolutely.

567
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,500
Ah, New York is no place
for a country gent.

568
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:20,691
I mean, ain't no crocodiles out
there, but a fast-moving Chevy

569
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,341
sure make a mess of you.

570
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,804
What's your game?

571
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,873
Great. I'm starving.

572
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,102
Ha ha! <i>Grazie</i>, Roberto.

573
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:51,199
Thank you. Um, perhaps I should
order for all of us, right?

574
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,600
I mean, I don't imagine
that they have any...

575
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,703
Kangaroo steak or possum grits!

576
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,188
Oh, don't worry about Mick.

577
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,066
He can make a gourmet meal
out of just about anything.

578
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,044
Even medium-rare goanna.

579
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,113
It was great, wasn't it, eh?
And what about the yams?

580
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,808
Oh, yes. They were great.

581
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,265
Well, that's...

582
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,307
That's wonderful.

583
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,898
As he's our guest,

584
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,044
perhaps he'd like to
order for all of us.

585
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,443
Oh, wait a minute. I'll do that.

586
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,826
No, it's... It's all right.

587
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,653
I'll have a lash.

588
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,576
- Italian, eh?
- Yes.

589
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,237
I don't know what you call it,
but I'd like to look at that dish

590
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,306
out there the big fat
sheila's eating.

591
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,514
Richard!

592
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,103
He okay?

593
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,110
Can't handle his drink, poor fella.

594
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,515
He said you hit him.

595
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,352
You're not in the pub
at Walkabout Creek now.

596
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,377
- He was being a pain.
- That's beside the point.

597
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,608
You're not serious about
this lemon, are you?

598
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,336
Butt out, Dundee!

599
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:30,051
He had a little too much to drink.

600
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,823
Richard is warm, caring,
and I love him, okay?

601
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,158
- Excuse me.
- What?

602
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,977
I think I'm going to throw up.

603
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,471
God.

604
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,124
- You want a hand?
- No. I can handle it.

605
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:02,792
I'm fine.

606
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,901
Listen, we've got a busy day
tomorrow, so get some sleep.

607
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,128
I'll pick you up early.

608
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,676
- Good night.
- Good night.

609
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,374
- I think you better take me to the boozer.
- Boozer?

610
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,227
Don't know that one.

611
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,920
Pub. You know, somewhere
to get a drink.

612
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,366
- Want to join me?
- I just finished my shift. Why not?

613
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,094
- Fancy a drink, do you?
- You kidding? I'm Italian.

614
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:38,290
I'd drink you under the
table any day, my friend.

615
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,792
Well, that could be interesting.

616
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:53,176
No, I'm not putting down
your black widow spider,

617
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,324
but the funnel-web spider can
kill a man in eight seconds,

618
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,426
just by looking at him.

619
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,206
Of course, the real danger down
there is the sharks, though,

620
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,333
the big ones, you know, like <i>Jaws</i>?

621
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,627
I caught one down there
about three weeks ago.

622
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,901
Got it opened. Know what
we found inside it?

623
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,359
Three Filipino fishermen...

624
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,801
- Still in their boat.
- Hey, buzzy!

625
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,200
Come on over, meet this
guy from Australia.

626
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,125
Hey, my man, what's happening?

627
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,127
Uh, where?

628
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,455
What's goin' down, bro?

629
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,630
Goin' down? Ah, yeah. Just
blowing the froth off a couple.

630
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,424
All right! Hang loose, my man.

631
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,765
- Flat out like a lizard drinking.
- Say what?

632
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,760
What?

633
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:48,777
He's cool.

634
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:51,112
Yeah. I'm cool. I'm cool.

635
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:01,222
All right!

636
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,745
All right!

637
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,685
He's a nice fellow.

638
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,480
Here's my little
Italian mate, Danny.

639
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:11,690
Just in time to buy
another round, too, mate.

640
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,109
What are you drinking, Gwendoline?

641
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:16,946
Ah, no more for me. Thanks, Mick.
I must be getting on home.

642
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,139
Oh.

643
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,843
Where's, uh...
Where's home, sweetie?

644
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,827
Just around the corner.

645
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:25,287
I have a little place where
I live all by my lonesome.

646
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,455
Not now.

647
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,809
- Most of the time, that is.
- Oh.

648
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,001
Must, uh...

649
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,586
Must get a bit lonely, eh?

650
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,713
Hanker for a bit of,
uh, male company?

651
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,282
Do I ever.

652
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,592
Hey, come here.

653
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,636
Uh, excuse me, Gwendoline.

654
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,455
Don't go away, love.

655
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,226
I have been trying to
tell you all night.

656
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:49,750
That girl, she's a guy.

657
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,021
Huh?

658
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,341
A man dressed up as a girl.

659
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,693
Nah.

660
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:58,422
A fag, for Christ's sakes!

661
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,351
I swear.

662
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:18,883
Oh!

663
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,219
Hey... That was a guy.

664
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,055
A guy dressed up like
a sheila. Look at that.

665
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,433
Hey, you all knew,
you pack of bastards.

666
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,370
Hey! Ah!

667
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,279
Where the hell did I leave the cab?

668
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,697
Don't know.

669
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,158
You wait here until I
go look for it, mate.

670
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,806
Righto, mate.

671
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,411
G'day, girls.

672
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,913
Mick Dundee from Australia.

673
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,087
Looking for a good time, honey?

674
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,553
Always looking for a good time.

675
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:30,496
Are either of you ladies attached
or married or anything like that?

676
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,916
No. We're both single ladies.

677
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:42,610
This is Karla. I'm Simone.
Where you from, honey?

678
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:47,388
I'm from Walkabout Creek
in the Northern Territory.

679
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,116
You probably don't
know where that is.

680
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,123
Hey. I do.

681
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:56,021
You're the guy I've been
reading about in the paper,

682
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,356
the "Crocodile Man."

683
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,233
I've been reading about
him in the paper.

684
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,110
He's like a regular Tarzan.

685
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,306
Wrestles crocodiles, eats snakes.

686
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,219
Is this your first
trip to New York?

687
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,937
First trip anywhere.

688
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,083
Well, hell.

689
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:18,711
We might just have to
give you one for free.

690
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:21,981
Yeah.

691
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:25,736
One what?

692
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:32,617
Huh.

693
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:39,440
Ah, maybe we could take in a movie
or, you know, go to a dance or...

694
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,760
Hey, girls, girls.

695
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:45,237
Are we working tonight
or are we socializing?

696
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,590
Hey, pal.

697
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:51,769
I was just talking to the ladies
and making a bit of progress.

698
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:56,024
Are you going to talk all night, my
man, or you going to screw one of them?

699
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,007
Listen, I'm sorry about that,

700
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:08,078
but if you stand around out the
front of a place like this,

701
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,678
you're going to hear that
kind of bad language.

702
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,847
I should've been home hours ago.

703
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,200
Nice chatting to you, ladies.

704
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,935
Hey, come on, Dan. You're
in no condition to drive.

705
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,538
Hop in, mate.

706
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:23,859
That's why you have so many
accidents over here...

707
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,054
The steering wheel's on the
wrong side of the car.

708
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,892
Get out of the way, dopey!

709
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:43,731
Get on the right side of
the road, you pelican!

710
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,704
<i>If I give my heart to you</i>

711
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,920
<i>Then I'll have none
and you'll have two</i>

712
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,447
<i>Señor</i> Mick?

713
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:31,885
Ah.

714
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,080
The towels for <i>Señor</i> Mick.

715
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,120
Is that you, Rosita?

716
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:39,268
Just leave the spare towels
on the bed, will you?

717
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:41,167
<i>Muchas gracias</i>, love.

718
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,836
<i>Si, Señor</i> Mick.

719
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,373
Struth!

720
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,442
Um... Hey, listen, uh...

721
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,979
Rosita, uh...

722
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,005
I was only being friendly.

723
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:10,048
You know, I didn't mean, um...

724
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,652
Your towels, <i>Señor</i> Mick.

725
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,571
Oh. Phew.

726
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,437
For a minute there, um...

727
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,506
Room service took on
a whole new meaning.

728
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,869
One dog, please.

729
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:06,414
With chili, onions,
sauerkraut, and some peppers.

730
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:13,880
There you go.

731
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,219
You eat that?

732
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:19,385
Well, you know, you can live on
it, but it tastes like shit.

733
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,549
My bag!

734
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,234
Somebody stop him!

735
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,757
Thief! Thief!

736
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,618
Hey, Mick!

737
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,995
How you doing, baby?
It's me, Simone!

738
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,496
Oh, yeah, Simone.

739
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:47,706
Having a good time?

740
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:49,150
As always.

741
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,404
Nice girl.

742
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:55,422
Thoughtful, too...

743
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,525
- Dancing with her father.
- Hmm.

744
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,842
You'll have to overcome this

745
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:01,162
- country boy shyness, Dundee.
- Hi.

746
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:02,454
Yeah.

747
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,245
Oh, there's someone
I want you to meet.

748
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:11,396
Ah! Sue, darling! You're back.

749
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,440
How wonderful.

750
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:14,608
Fran, how are you?

751
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:16,552
Couldn't be better.

752
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:20,507
Tell me, who's the new man?

753
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,325
This is the man I'm writing
about, Mick Dundee.

754
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,643
Oh!

755
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,018
Something the matter, darling?

756
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,749
Oh!

757
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,959
Hi. Pleased to meet you.

758
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,438
It's okay. He's Australian.

759
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,818
Maybe I'd better go there someday.

760
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,095
Oh, darling, I'm so
glad you could come.

761
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:44,539
Excuse me.

762
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,337
Ah. Just making sure.

763
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,438
Right.

764
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,041
I'll get us a drink.

765
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,129
It's good shit.

766
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,524
What's up, pal? Got a
blocked nose, have you?

767
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,109
Blocked nose. Right.

768
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:39,031
There's a better way
of doing it than that.

769
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,238
Better way, huh?

770
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:43,983
Yep.

771
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,011
It's the way we do it back home.

772
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,035
It really fixes us up.

773
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:02,965
Now, boil the water,

774
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:06,404
get the steam going. Right.

775
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,599
Put your face right over that.

776
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:11,978
And the old tea towel
over your scalp.

777
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,204
Put your head right down onto that.

778
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:16,307
Breathe it in real deep.

779
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,836
Ten minutes of that, you'll be
clear as a bell. No worries.

780
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,232
Get into it.

781
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,657
That will do it.

782
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,104
You know, Mick, that was probably

783
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,273
a couple hundred dollars'
worth of cocaine.

784
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,502
What's that?

785
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:47,005
Oh. It's a drug. You sniff it.

786
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:49,386
What for?

787
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,718
Well, to get a buzz.

788
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,438
What, like shoving a
blowfly up your nose?

789
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:12,364
Got the photo, Mick.

790
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:13,993
I look great.

791
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,742
Yeah.

792
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,915
Ida sends love.

793
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:20,630
Wait a minute. Donk wants
to have a word to you.

794
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:23,632
Mick! Get stuffed!

795
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,359
Very good.

796
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,279
How you getting on with
the New Yorkers, Mick?

797
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,822
<i>Oh, bonzer people.</i>

798
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:34,052
<i>Friendly, full of beans,
but, uh, a bit weird.</i>

799
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:37,101
<i>Well, that's the joys of traveling.</i>

800
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,436
<i>Uh. When are you coming home, mate?</i>

801
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:42,477
Well, if you can manage,
Wal, I'd like to stay a while.

802
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:45,442
Oh, yeah. No troubles at all.

803
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:49,451
Wouldn't have anything to do with
a certain lady writer, would it?

804
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,635
Yeah, well,

805
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:53,955
to start with, she's a
better kisser than Donk.

806
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:56,744
You little beauty.

807
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:58,626
Keep in touch.

808
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:01,291
<i>Yeah. No worries, Wal. Ta-ta.</i>

809
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,815
Come on, Wal, what'd he say?

810
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:08,234
Well, he wants to stay there
a little while longer.

811
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,303
He wants me to take
care of things here.

812
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,352
You got a light, buddy?

813
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,689
Yeah. Sure, kid. There you go.

814
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,149
And your wallet.

815
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:34,078
Mick, give him your wallet.

816
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,989
- What for?
- He's got a knife.

817
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:40,418
That's not a knife.

818
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:44,956
That's a knife.

819
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:53,214
Shit!

820
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,855
Just kids having fun.
Are you all right?

821
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,416
I'm always all right when
I'm with you, Dundee.

822
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,895
God, that sounds corny.

823
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:11,316
Why do you always make me feel
like Jane in a Tarzan comic?

824
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,931
That's what we ran while
you were down under.

825
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:04,751
Sorry. Can't seem to
get my mind in gear.

826
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,776
Sue, when you were away,

827
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:15,926
I, uh... I did some thinking.

828
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:20,434
It's time I made
some concrete plans.

829
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:21,993
Are you building a freeway

830
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:24,847
or proposing to the finest
catch in New York state?

831
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:27,816
Hello, young lady. Been
reading your articles.

832
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:29,709
It seems you've been
tripping all over the world,

833
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,778
enjoying yourself at our expense.

834
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:34,902
Well, I'd like to think you're
getting your money's worth.

835
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:38,510
Hi, Dad.

836
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,784
You got a kiss for the old man?

837
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:48,625
Thank God you're home safe.

838
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:50,855
Have you told Sue about Sunday?

839
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:52,398
Oh, I was just about to.

840
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:55,193
You're coming out to the weekend
house for a welcome home dinner.

841
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,028
But, right now, I want
Richard to explain

842
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,696
how he runs this newspaper
better than I do

843
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,344
when I'm away.

844
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:04,141
By all means, bring along
this, uh, Crocodile Dundee.

845
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:06,063
Him, I've got to meet.

846
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,658
I thought you said your
dad sells newspapers.

847
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:44,784
Oh, well...

848
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,887
He sells a lot of newspapers.

849
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,544
Thank you, Gus.

850
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:18,423
Oh, hell. The dogs are out.

851
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:20,759
Mick.

852
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:11,101
Nice to see you again,
Miss. Mr. Mason.

853
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,665
Good to see you looking
so fit and well.

854
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:15,518
Simpson, Mr. Dundee.

855
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:18,771
Nice to meet you, Simo.

856
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:23,613
Call me Mick.

857
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:25,277
Mick.

858
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,512
Ahem. Your father's
expecting you, Miss.

859
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,490
He's waiting with his
guests in the lounge.

860
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:43,762
Oh, excuse me.

861
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:48,183
- Hi, pumpkin.
- Hi, Dad.

862
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:50,935
- Richard.
- Good to see you.

863
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,579
And this of course is Mr. Dundee.

864
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:54,706
Yep.

865
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:57,327
I believe I'm deeply in your debt
for saving my daughter's life.

866
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,938
Well, um... Buy me a cold beer,
and we'll call it quits.

867
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:04,882
Nice joint you got here.

868
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,218
Well, it keeps the
rain off our heads.

869
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,242
Come. I want you to
meet some people.

870
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,327
Patricia, a drink for Mr. Dundee.

871
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:14,577
Oh, my God, look who's here.

872
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,770
- My Dawn.
- How are you?

873
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,231
Dorothy and Wendell
Wainwright. From Australia.

874
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:21,816
- Oh.
- Nice to meet you, Wendell.

875
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,651
Mick. Have a drink.

876
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:24,736
Thank you.

877
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:27,260
Are you involved in
cattle, Mr. Dundee?

878
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,240
Yeah. Mostly buffaloes.

879
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:31,139
- Oh.
- Do you breed them?

880
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,077
No, I just toss them.

881
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:35,351
And how are you finding New York?

882
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:38,166
- Bit of a lunatic asylum, eh?
- Oh.

883
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:39,959
That's why I love it,
'cause I fit right in.

884
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:45,048
if you'll excuse me, I'd like Mick
to say hello to Senator Manly.

885
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:46,742
That's a good idea.

886
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:48,736
- It was nice meeting you.
- See you later.

887
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,638
Seems like a personable fellow.

888
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:53,991
What a strange gentleman.

889
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:55,542
Nice people.

890
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:58,708
Dorothy's fine now, but she
used to be really uptight.

891
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:00,897
What happened?

892
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:02,545
She found a wonderful shrink.

893
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:05,464
Psychiatrist.

894
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:10,433
I shouldn't have made that crack
about the lunatic asylum.

895
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,327
Didn't know she was nuts.

896
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:16,681
Of course, she's not nuts.

897
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:20,625
People go to a psychiatrist
to talk about their problems.

898
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,668
She just needed to unload them.

899
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:24,712
You know, bring them
out in the open.

900
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,315
Hasn't she got any mates?

901
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:30,160
You're right. Guess we
could all use more mates.

902
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,573
I suppose you don't have any
shrinks at Walkabout Creek?

903
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:37,250
No. Back there, if you got
a problem, you tell Wally.

904
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,185
And he tells everyone in town,

905
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:41,505
brings it out in the
open, no more problem.

906
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,358
Richard! You could
make it this evening.

907
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:46,651
Wendell, good to see you.

908
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,236
And I don't believe I
know your daughter.

909
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:49,737
- Oh, stop it!
- Oh, Richard!

910
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:03,064
Ladies and gentlemen.

911
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:06,355
Friends. Welcome home, Sue.

912
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:15,346
As... As you can see, we're
all glad to have you back.

913
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,120
Of course, no one more than I.

914
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:20,335
I guess everyone in this room

915
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:23,542
knows how this beautiful lady
and I I feel about each other.

916
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:27,967
Sue's come back to us,

917
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:31,134
delivered, literally, out
of the jaws of death

918
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:34,433
by our new-found friend,
Mr. Michael J. Dundee.

919
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:39,305
A man... A man to whom
I am doubly indebted.

920
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:42,290
Of course, not only did he bring
back to me the woman that I love,

921
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,958
but he managed to
increase the circulation

922
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,527
of the newspaper in the process.

923
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:50,316
You know, uh...
Sam said to me earlier,

924
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:51,841
"You're her editor."

925
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:55,052
"Can't you stop her from taking
all these dangerous assignments?"

926
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:58,055
Well, quite obviously, I have
not had a great deal of success

927
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,999
influencing her as her editor.

928
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:03,211
Perhaps I'll have more
success as her husband.

929
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:07,333
- If she'll have me.
- Oh, Richard.

930
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:32,066
Congratulations.

931
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,868
It's a pleasure having
you here to share this.

932
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:38,429
Well done. Well done.

933
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:41,454
Thank you very much. I couldn't
have done it without your help.

934
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,461
Sweetheart?

935
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:02,054
I'll get in the back, Gus.

936
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:22,240
To the hotel, Mick?

937
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:25,415
Yeah, Gus, by way
of a liquor store.

938
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:32,467
For medicinal purposes.

939
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:36,717
Thanks, mate.

940
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:01,204
Hey, you take care, now.

941
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:23,719
Hey, buddy.

942
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,686
Get it into you, pop.

943
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,523
God bless you. You
saved my life, really.

944
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:43,830
Hey, Simone.

945
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:50,704
You want some action?

946
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,924
Uh, I thought you
were somebody else.

947
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,028
Well, if it ain't the
man who don't like

948
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:01,552
bad fucking language
in front of ladies.

949
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:04,677
What's the matter, Aussie boy?

950
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,849
You going to make like a
kangaroo and hop away?

951
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:30,457
Time for a little tap dance.

952
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,118
You okay, Mick?

953
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:06,242
Oh, yeah, Gus. No worries.

954
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,581
I was just getting on top of them.

955
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:22,194
You sure you're not
Pintinjarra tribe?

956
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:24,989
No, man. Harlem Warlords.

957
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:27,968
I knew you were tribal.

958
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,945
Mick Dundee's room, please.

959
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:56,687
<i>I'm sorry. He's still
not answering.</i>

960
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:59,962
Uh, he called down this morning
to say he was checking out today.

961
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:02,344
<i>We're going to miss
him around here.</i>

962
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:03,719
Thanks.

963
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:14,935
Thank you, sir.

964
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:25,216
G'day, Irving. How are you, mate?

965
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:27,991
Oh, yeah. I wouldn't
be dead for dollars.

966
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:29,470
Close.

967
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:31,790
Are you leaving us, Mick?
You going back home?

968
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,997
Ah, no. I thought I'd go Walkabout.

969
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:36,544
Huh?

970
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:39,168
Wander around,
take a look at America.

971
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,007
For how long?

972
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:43,502
Long as it takes.

973
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,421
What's the quickest
way out of town?

974
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:47,738
Well, if you're looking
for adventure,

975
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:49,573
there's a subway two
blocks that way.

976
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,575
It'll take you to Grand
Central Station.

977
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,223
That'll do. Uh...

978
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:56,356
Have a nice day, Oiving.

979
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:59,109
Uh, no worries, mate.

980
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:29,638
- Morning, Miss.
- Morning.

981
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:31,842
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

982
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:35,452
No, but it will come to me.

983
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:38,038
Incidentally, Miss, if you're
looking for Crocodile Mick,

984
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:39,561
he's gone walkabout.

985
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:41,939
I don't suppose you know where?

986
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:44,920
Yeah. He's headed for the
subway two blocks down.

987
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:46,364
You'd better hurry.

988
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:48,195
Mind this for me.

989
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:58,873
Oh, Christ.

990
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:21,330
Hey, lady, where you going?

991
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,894
If you want to play, why
don't you play with me?

992
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:32,344
Mick!

993
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:33,972
Mick Dundee!

994
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:38,518
- Ooowweee!
- What's up, lady?

995
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:41,620
I got to talk to that
man down the end.

996
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:42,938
The one in the black hat.

997
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:48,353
Hey!

998
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:55,785
Lady here wants to talk to
the guy in the black hat!

999
01:31:57,846 --> 01:31:59,914
Hey, fella!

1000
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:01,953
You in the hat!

1001
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:04,578
The lady down the end
wants to see you!

1002
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:07,671
What does she want?

1003
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:10,963
What does she want?

1004
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:13,131
What do you want?

1005
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:17,261
Tell him not to leave.

1006
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:20,052
I'm not going to marry Richard.

1007
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:27,018
Tell him don't leave. She's
not going to marry Richard.

1008
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:31,730
Don't leave. I'm not
going to marry Richard.

1009
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,113
Why not?

1010
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:38,036
I don't know.

1011
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:39,570
Why not?

1012
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:41,906
Why not?

1013
01:32:44,184 --> 01:32:46,286
Tell him I love him.

1014
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:48,584
I love you!

1015
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:51,753
I love ya!

1016
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:56,717
I love ya! I love ya!

1017
01:32:57,864 --> 01:32:59,591
She loves me.

1018
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,092
Well?

1019
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,219
Um, tell her I...

1020
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:05,184
I'll tell her meself.
I'm coming through.

1021
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:07,607
He's coming through!

1022
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:09,275
He's coming through!

1023
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,779
It's too crowded. We're
jammed in like sheep.

1024
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,822
Up, up, up.

1025
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,783
Coming through!

1026
01:33:22,305 --> 01:34:22,196
