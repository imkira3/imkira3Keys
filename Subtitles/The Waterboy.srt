2
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,256
Cut his ass.

3
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,676
Let's go!

4
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,016
Heads up! That's it, that's it!

5
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,105
That's it!

6
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:11,403
- Hey, coach, how you been?
- Lynn Swann.

7
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,740
Now why ain't I surprised
to see you snoopin' around

8
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,950
my football field first day of practice?

9
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,078
You got a good-lookin' football team.

10
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,790
Maybe good enough to add another trophy
to the old case downstairs.

11
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,459
Kinda like my old man
told me one time, Lynn.

12
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:30,506
"The only thing better than a crawfish
dinner is five crawfish dinners."

13
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,557
Hey, here comes the shithead.

14
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,540
It's clean.

15
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,543
It's cold.

16
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,337
Now that's what I call
high-quality H20.

17
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,383
Right in the head!

18
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,386
It's over there!

19
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,395
Any unused magic in that legendary
green playbook of yours, Red?

20
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,276
I may have a couple
squirreled away in there for...

21
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,819
...a rainy day.

22
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,088
See what we got here.

23
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,763
Not exactly what I'd call
constructive criticism.

24
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,185
Smell like you could use
a shower, stinky.

25
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,855
Listen, you could think what
you want about my personal hygiene,

26
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,899
but, please, don't waste any water.

27
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,861
That's bad policy. If you need
to amuse yourself at my expense,

28
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,697
just rough me up or something.

29
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,616
Fair enough.

30
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,037
Hey, waterboy!

31
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,289
Seriously, I could injure myself.

32
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,709
Laski, get over here!

33
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,337
Yes, sir, coach.

34
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,505
What is that moron doin' here?

35
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,635
Didn't I tell you as plain as I could
speak to get rid of his ass last year?

36
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,347
I didn't think you were serious.
Besides, he does a greatjob.

37
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,475
Disrupting my football team, you idiot!

38
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,062
Eighteen years of this is enough!

39
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,314
Hey, waterboy!

40
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,318
- Yes, Mr. Coach Beaulieu.
- You're fired!

41
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,821
OK.

42
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,830
Get out of the way, you moron!

43
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,945
Bobby Boucher,
come give your mama a kiss.

44
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,655
Hi, Steve.

45
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,953
Why you home so early,
my precious angel?

46
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,623
Mama, somethin' bad happened today.

47
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,544
Somebody hurt you, my boy? Who hurt
you? You tell Mama who hurt you.

48
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,921
Nobody, Mama. It's just that

49
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,633
I lost my position as the team's
water distribution engineer.

50
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,470
Why, that's the best news
I heard in a dog's age.

51
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,557
Now you be able to spend your days
at home where you belong.

52
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,227
Yes, but... I was...

53
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,563
I was thinkin',
Mama, maybe I could...

54
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,650
I could try to get another
waterboy job for a different team.

55
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,111
Don't raise your voice to me,
Bobby Boucher.

56
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,197
I wasn't raising my voice, Mama.

57
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,950
I don't like confrontation
'cause I'm a Virgo.

58
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,037
Who told you you was a Virgo?

59
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,999
Vicki Vallencourt, that... that girl.

60
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:38,170
A girl? Bobby Boucher!

61
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,173
Don't you remember what your mama
told you about girls?

62
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,383
I remember, Mama.

63
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,680
There was someone else
at Lawson's Creek this morning.

64
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,475
- Really?
- We looked for crawfish together.

65
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,686
- Her name's Vicki.
- I don't ever want you associatin'

66
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,813
- with little girls.
- Why not, Mama?

67
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,649
Because little girls are the devil!

68
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,361
Mama, it's just that I'm a waterboy.

69
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,072
The team gets thirsty,
and I bring them the water.

70
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,949
They need water. I likes
to be the one that brings it.

71
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,203
They like to give you a boot
in the patoot for your trouble.

72
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:16,500
Bobby, you don't have what they call
"the social skills."

73
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,210
People don't understand you.

74
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,713
That's why you never have any friends,
except for your mama.

75
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,591
All I know is this, Jimmy:
Next Friday, August 29th,

76
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,426
Baton Rouge Exposition Center,

77
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,929
I'm gonna open a can
of whoop-ass on Herculon.

78
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:34,351
I'm gonna drive him back into  whatever
galaxy he came from. That's a promise!

79
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,271
Strong  words from a strong man,
Captain Insano.

80
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:43,360
Now let's take a call. It's our
old friend from Jackson's Bayou, Mr. B.

81
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:48,240
Hello, Jim. Is it possible
to speak to Captain Insano?

82
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,409
- Shoot, Mr. B.
- Captain Insano,

83
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,578
I notice sometimes
when you are wrestling

84
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,498
or openin' up a can ofwhoop-ass,
as you like to say,

85
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,001
- you seem to be sweating profusely.
- Yeah?

86
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,089
I was wondering if, perhaps,
you might need the services

87
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,258
of an experienced waterboy.

88
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,680
That's pretty cute.
How old are you, kid? Eleven, 12?

89
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,640
I am 31 years old.

90
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,611
I guarantee that guy's still a virgin.

91
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,039
This is where
they strip the ball from us.

92
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,708
And then we miss one tackle.

93
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,962
Two tackles.
Joey drops the ball.

94
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,341
He has time to pick it up and dust it
off and run in for a touchdown

95
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,385
before our guys even know
what's goin' on.

96
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,437
- Hello?
- My name is Bobby Boucher.

97
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,525
I am inquiring as to whether you have
the need for an experienced waterboy

98
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,693
on your upcoming season.

99
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,279
Nice suit.

100
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,949
Thank you. It was my daddy's.

101
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,159
- Hold that thought.
- Yeah.

102
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,372
Come on. Come here.
Come here. Come on.

103
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:04,709
Come on, everybody. All right,
this is it. This is the play.

104
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,879
This is the play.
This is the play. OK?

105
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,466
The quarterback. Receivers
lined up to the left, one to the right.

106
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,011
There's a flanker lined up to the left
behind the quarterback.

107
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,264
He gives the ball...
No, he doesn't.

108
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,474
The receiver goes
over to the left.

109
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,727
Once the quarterback has the ball,

110
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,814
he fakes to the left. No.

111
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,525
He fakes to the right.
He doesn't fake.

112
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,280
He thinks about faking.
He pretends to fake.

113
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,742
I don't know where I am.

114
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,578
I can't breathe.

115
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,582
This room is getting smaller.
I have to sit down.

116
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,251
Hang on here.
Take some water.

117
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,302
All right, there.

118
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:05,604
This is good. This is much better
than what I serve.

119
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,983
That is the water that
you serve to your players?

120
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,613
It is imperative that you allow me
to be your waterboy.

121
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:19,451
I can't hire you.
I can't hire anybody. We're the...

122
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,911
You do not have to pay me.
I will do it for free.

123
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,582
Promise me that you will never
distribute the contents of thatjug

124
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,710
- to any human person.
- That's a deal.

125
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,378
It's a deal?

126
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,759
Thank you so much, Coach Klein.
I will not let you down.

127
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,302
- Good day.
- Good day.

128
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,221
I'll see you at practice.

129
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,247
Quit hoggin' that. Pass it over.

130
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,183
OK.

131
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,269
Just have the defense run sprints.

132
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,543
Yo! Water's better cold.

133
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:56,381
Yes, I agree. But to guarantee
that the H20 is purified,

134
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,217
it's good to use
the heating source, Sterno.

135
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:03,138
It's like my mama always says,
"Better safe than sorry."

136
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,019
My mama says that too.
Aren't all mamas the same?

137
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,563
- Yes.
- Derek.

138
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,024
- I kick the field goals around here.
- Will you listen up?

139
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,236
I need your cooperation.
I need it now.

140
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,073
- Is he gonna be all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

141
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,409
He has his good days and his bad days.

142
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,911
Used to be assistant coach
at some big school,

143
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,039
but he had a mental breakdown
or something. Don't worry.

144
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,126
He'll snap out of it. Let me know
when it cools down, baby.

145
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,378
- Yes.
- All right.

146
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,052
Hey, did you all get a load
of the new waterboy?

147
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,849
Let's make him feel right at home.
Jerry, go right.

148
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,770
Casey, go left. Way left.

149
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,230
- On one. Ready?
- Break!

150
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,196
Set!

151
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,572
Red 22!

152
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,241
Red, 22!

153
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,367
Hut!

154
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,592
I think you zigged
when you should've zagged on that play.

155
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,930
- Sorry.
- Hey, waterboy, check this out.

156
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,036
Hey, waterboy!
Check this out.

157
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,880
Well, my, my, my.
Was my little aquatic engineer

158
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,174
about to bash one
of my football players?

159
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,844
Well, he spit in the cooler.

160
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,347
He happens to be
a finely tuned athletic machine.

161
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,518
And I ain't gonna have him hit
in the head by some idiot waterboy.

162
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,730
Do you understand me?

163
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,316
- Are you all right?
- I wasn't gonna do nothin'.

164
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,361
You better do something.
You gotta defend yourself.

165
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,781
But they're finely-tuned
athletic machines.

166
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,492
I am not telling you
to go on a shooting rampage.

167
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:33,371
But you have to stand up for yourself
or they'll ride you all season long.

168
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,457
Believe me, I've seen it myself.

169
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:49,512
Hey, moron!

170
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,809
Look at me. I'm the waterboy.

171
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,689
I got a wooden spoon.

172
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,694
Smell like you could use
a shower, stinky.

173
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,156
You're fired!

174
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,246
Stop makin' fun of me.

175
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,500
Red, ready! Hut!

176
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,465
- Wow!
- Damn!

177
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,095
I'm sorry.

178
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,060
Who that? Who there?

179
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,566
So that's what openin' up
a can ofwhoop-ass feels like.

180
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,528
Son, you just opened
a whole case ofwhoop-ass.

181
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,282
I would be honored if you
play football for this team.

182
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,370
- Me? Play football?
- Yes.

183
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:59,123
Thanks, but no thanks. My mama
won't let me play no football.

184
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,627
We're gonna go home.
You and l, we're gonna talk to Mama.

185
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,546
Mama said... Mama said...
Mama said... Mama said...

186
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,175
- My mama said...
- She's gonna say yes.

187
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,482
That snake looks delicious.

188
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,152
What part do you think
I'm about to eat?

189
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,572
Basically, a snake don't have parts.

190
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,659
But, if I had to call it anything,

191
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,745
I would say it's his knee.

192
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,082
Great. His knee.

193
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,752
And what are we having for dessert?

194
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,216
Squirrel.

195
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,762
Excellent.

196
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,182
Let's talk about Bobby
playing football.

197
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,352
I don't like it, Mr. Coach Klein.
I don't like it one bit.

198
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,230
My boy is too delicate
to be playin' foosball,

199
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,357
or whatever, with them gargantuans.

200
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,693
I don't think you understand...

201
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,571
No, you don't understand me,
Mr. Coach Klein.

202
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,823
My boy is all I got left.

203
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,452
Mama, here.

204
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,495
It's the brain pain, coach.

205
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,999
You see, my husband Robert,

206
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,544
one day back in 1966,
pick up sticks,

207
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:30,381
and me four months pregnant
with this precious angel,

208
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,884
he decides he wants
to help foreign peoples.

209
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:37,180
He's gonna go join the Peace Corps.
He promise me everything's gonna be OK.

210
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,058
Just like you promisin' me now.

211
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,144
But everything wasn't OK. No.

212
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,814
He got lost in the middle
of the Sahara Desert.

213
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,984
And he died. He died!

214
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,821
Couldn't get no water.
He died of the dehydration.

215
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,408
- And we were left all alone.
- I would've gotten my daddy water,

216
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,036
but I was just a baby
inside Mama's stomach.

217
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,164
Now you wanna take away
the only part of Robert I have left.

218
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,543
But don't you want the only part you've
got left to get a college education?

219
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,090
- Nah.
- Me, a college student?

220
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:17,136
Yes. Bobby, think about it.
A whole new world will open to you.

221
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,890
Boy, Mama, that sounds nice.
Me, a college man.

222
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,767
Coach, my Bobby's a sweet boy,

223
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,728
but he ain't what you'd call
college material.

224
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,439
So don't fill his head
with all those crazy dreams

225
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,442
of school and college
and things of that sort.

226
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,946
But Mama, I'm tired of everybody
callin' me a dummy.

227
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,448
I'm tired of not havin' any friends.

228
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,701
My ass is tired ofjawin' all night.
I'm goin' to bed.

229
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:44,872
Nice to meet you, Mr. Coach.
Good luck with your foosball.

230
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,126
Bobby, after you let Mr. Coach out,
you come into my bedroom.

231
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,044
Mama'll brush your hair.

232
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:59,053
When I was your age, my mother told me
not to get a tattoo of Roy Orbison.

233
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,855
But what Mama don't know won't hurt her.

234
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,736
I trust you'll make the right decision.

235
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:32,253
Damn, I don't want that ass on the team.

236
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,255
Everybody's gonna laugh at us.

237
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:39,218
Everybody's already laughin' at us.
We ain't won a game since 1994.

238
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,806
- Hey! What's up, baby?
- Hey.

239
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,433
Where's your helmet?

240
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,019
Derek, they don't got no more helmets.

241
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,022
Here. You can share mine.

242
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,608
Try it on, man. See if it fits.

243
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,488
- All right.
- Thanks, friend.

244
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,658
What a dink.

245
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,328
Come on! Huddle up!

246
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,750
We have an announcement to make.
Our former waterboy, Bobby Boucher,

247
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,961
is gonna play some linebacker for us.

248
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,298
"I'm a football player."

249
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,386
- Coach, I'd like to tackle him now.
- Not yet.

250
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,806
All right. I wanna work with offense.
I wanna work with defense.

251
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,143
- Go with Farmer Fran, do some laps.
- Shit.

252
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:37,068
Line up on the ball.

253
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,950
- All right? Third and ten.
- Third and ten?

254
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,747
Yeah, that's
the offense's last opportunity

255
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,250
to gain ten yards
before they have to punt.

256
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,753
- Gee, he's gonna run the option.
- Option?

257
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,589
He ain't never gonna be able
to figure this out.

258
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,592
Yes, he is.

259
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:05,137
Now, Bobby,
you've waterboyed for 18 years.

260
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,431
Didn't you occasionally watch the game?

261
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,726
I had a lot to keep me busy.

262
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,105
Checking the pH levels,
refillin' the cups.

263
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,274
All right. Let's just keep it simple.

264
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:21,946
Casey. I want you to tackle Casey
like you did Gee yesterday.

265
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,949
- Right now?
- Right now! Go!

266
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,286
- Does he know about this?
- Doesn't matter. You're a warrior.

267
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,870
Go.

268
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,129
What you doin'?

269
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,800
All right. Bobby, Bobby.

270
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,469
Don't be afraid to use
all of your strength.

271
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,807
He's resilient. He's a resilient guy.
OK? Come on.

272
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,643
Hey, Casey,
I think he wanna make out with you.

273
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,979
OK, that's enough. Thank you.

274
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:59,275
Is there any sport that you do watch?
You know, a physical sport?

275
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,610
- Boxing? Hockey?
- Wrestling.

276
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:05,906
Wrestling! Wrestling is good.
Who's your favorite wrestler?

277
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,368
Even though he was slightly
discourteous to me recently,

278
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,454
I'm gonna have to say Captain Insano.

279
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,416
OK, I want you to do to Casey

280
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,546
what Captain Insano does
to the bad guy. Go.

281
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,517
- He poked me in the eye.
- Captain Insano shows no mercy.

282
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,606
Bobby, where was the intensity
that I saw yesterday?

283
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,525
No intensity. You said
it was all right to fight back,

284
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,195
and I just started thinkin'
about all the people

285
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,822
who'd been mean to me over the years.

286
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,325
That's it. That's it.

287
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,952
I want you to think about
all those mean people.

288
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:56,540
- They're gonna be your tackling fuel.
- Tacklin' fuel.

289
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,544
- We're gonna use them to play football.
- Tacklin' fuel.

290
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:05,883
I want you to pretend that Casey
is insulting you.

291
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,595
- Pretend?
- I want you to visualize

292
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,848
people that have been mean to you
and then attack.

293
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,102
I want you to visualize and then attack.
Can you handle that?

294
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,979
- I'll try.
- He's gonna try.

295
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,951
What's the matter with you, boy?
You too stupid

296
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,702
to do what your coach tells ya?

297
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,999
- No!
- No what?

298
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,843
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Coach told me to pretend.

299
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,178
Bobby. Bobby!

300
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,306
Can you do this for me
every single game? Can you do this?

301
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:58,936
Coach, not only
will I do it for you, I...

302
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,229
Yes, I'll do it for ya.

303
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:09,280
So why you pick this class anyway?
It's pretty hard.

304
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,739
Beautiful view.

305
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:18,038
- Correct.
- All right, all right!

306
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,790
Y'all shut up now!

307
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:24,211
Now, last week, we talked about

308
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:29,633
the physiology of the animal brain
as it pertains to aggression.

309
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,304
Now is there anyone here
that can tell me why

310
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,307
most alligators
are abnormally aggressive?

311
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,727
- I know the answer to this question.
- Raise your hand.

312
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,271
Anybody? Anyone?

313
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,899
Yes, sir. You, sir.

314
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,944
Mama says that alligators are ornery

315
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,655
'cause they got all them teeth
but no toothbrush.

316
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,787
Your mama said alligators are ornery

317
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:03,125
'cause they got all them teeth
and no toothbrush.

318
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,838
Wow! Anybody else?
Yes, sir. You, sir.

319
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,675
Alligators are aggressive because
of an enlarged medulla oblongata.

320
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,346
- It controls aggressive behavior.
- That is correct!

321
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,848
- The medulla oblongata.
- But Mama said...

322
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,851
The medulla oblongata...

323
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:26,232
...is where anger, jealousy
and aggression come from.

324
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,443
Now is there anybody here

325
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,987
can tell me where happiness comes from?

326
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,199
- No, man.
- Anyone?

327
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:41,622
All right, let's hear what
Mama has to say on the subject.

328
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,292
Mama say that happiness
is from magic rays of sunshine

329
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,419
that come down when you feelin' blue.

330
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,842
Well, folks, Mama's wrong again.

331
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,806
No, Colonel Sanders, you're wrong.
Mama's right.

332
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,644
You're all wrong.
Mama's right. Mama's right!

333
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,939
Somethin' wrong
with his medulla oblongata.

334
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,740
It's OK to fight back.
Coach Klein said I could.

335
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,368
Mr. Coach Klein said I could.
It's fine, fellas.

336
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,706
Well, Mud Dog fans,
it's time to kick off

337
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,085
another year of Mud Dog football.
With the weight of a 40-game

338
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,714
losing streak on their back,
everyone seems to be diggin' in

339
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,841
for the long haul.

340
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,029
- What you doin', Bobby?
- Oh, Lord, that's some

341
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:59,158
heavy-duty armpit saturation. An
early warning sign of the dehydration.

342
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,119
- You gots to have H20.
- Stop worryin' about water

343
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,122
and start worryin'
about the game today. Here.

344
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:10,961
Nowjust do whatever you did
to Colonel Sanders, and you'll be fine.

345
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:15,299
I will, thank you. I just...
I feel bad about lyin' to my mama.

346
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,760
I wonder what she's doin' right now.

347
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,810
And he's down
with a three-yard kickoff return.

348
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,855
- The Mud Dogs offense takes the field.
- OK, you can do it.

349
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,232
Gain some yards.
Put points on the board.

350
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,777
Hey, Walter,
I'll bet you 50 bucks

351
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,781
Gee Grenouille throws a touchdown pass
on the first play. Check it out.

352
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,492
Set, blue 22, hut!

353
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,169
You owe me 50 bucks!

354
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,798
You said it was gonna be
a touchdown pass, you crazy asshole.

355
00:27:55,882 --> 00:28:00,177
Go, go, go, go! Hold 'em, hold 'em!
You can do it. Come on.

356
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,180
Bobby, this is
just like we practiced, OK?

357
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,598
OK, go, go, go. Come on.

358
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,187
Watch where you're going, needle dick.

359
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,447
Set!

360
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:25,911
Time for the retard to find out
what college football's all about.

361
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,873
390!

362
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,709
Check, check!

363
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,921
- Red, 18!
- Red, 18!

364
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,216
Needle dick! Needle dick!
Needle dick!

365
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:47,307
- Yeah!
- Your name is needle dick.

366
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,394
I knew that this was a good idea.

367
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,700
Yes!

368
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,206
- Timeout from the game.
- What's he calling timeout for?

369
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:16,920
- What are you doin'?
- Here, this is for you. Enjoy.

370
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,883
- Hey,  waterboy, you're fired!
- Stop it!

371
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,975
Yes! Bobby!

372
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,149
- Yeah, man! Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah!

373
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:41,236
- Slap hands!
- Whatever.

374
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,409
Waterboy's killin' 'em.

375
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,954
He's the best tackler
I've seen since Joe Montana.

376
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,291
Joe Montana was a quarterback,
you idiot.

377
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,168
I said Joe Mantegna.

378
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:01,131
We're tied at seven with 30 seconds
to go in the fourth quarter.

379
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,675
Eagle cover two. Ready?

380
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,431
Best of luck to you
on the upcoming play.

381
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:13,393
I'll be playin'
with your mama tonight.

382
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:17,314
- Sixty-two.
- Blue 22, hut!

383
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,859
Bernard drops back.
Looks like a screen pass.

384
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,780
Sixty-two! Sixty-two!
There you are!

385
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,157
Thank you.

386
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,327
Number 62 is headed for the end zone.

387
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,789
He's at the 40, 30.
He's almost...

388
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,501
Touchdown! Reds lead.

389
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,005
Dropkicked him.
Boucher knocked him out cold.

390
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,634
I love my mama very much.
Now you know that.

391
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:53,684
The waterboy handed them the game.
What an idiot.

392
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,769
Waterboy, you stink!

393
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:01,650
Nice job, shithead.
You just lost us the game.

394
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:05,779
I'm sorry. Would you please
still be my friend?

395
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,741
- No! Get away from me.
- OK.

396
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,083
Excuse me? May I help you?

397
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,213
- Hey, stud.
- Vicki Vallencourt, this is...

398
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,551
- This is quite a pleasant surprise.
- Yeah, I just got out ofjail

399
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:31,638
- and I heard you were playin' football.
- Yes, well, I've...

400
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,438
Yes.

401
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:49,114
So what say we go and get
somethin' to eat, catch up on things.

402
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,910
Mama's not a big fan of restaurants

403
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,870
or of me going to one.

404
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,708
But if you'd like, sometimes,

405
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:03,045
Mama, she... she got...
on a Sunday afternoon...

406
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:07,758
There's a grill
with the charcoal biscuits.

407
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,260
- You want me to come to a barbecue?
- That's it.

408
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,887
Sounds great.

409
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:18,560
And by the way, I hope you like
what I did to your lawn mower.

410
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,950
You know that old hag that does
astrology on Good Morning America,

411
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,703
she ought to pack it in.
Listen what she said for Sagittarius:

412
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,998
"You're gonna be faced
with a difficult decision today."

413
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,752
But the thing is, we're all faced
with difficult decisions every day.

414
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:47,798
- Like sayin' you're gonna eat today.
- Maybe by leaving her predictions

415
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,257
vague and generalized,

416
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:53,136
there's less of a chance of someone
findin' out she's a phony.

417
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,806
- Whatever, college boy.
- Don't say college boy.

418
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,724
- Here comes Mama.
- OK.

419
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,398
That looks nice, Mama.

420
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,986
- Here you go, Vicki Vallencourt.
- Thank you.

421
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,155
Mama, Vicki's an astrologist.

422
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,866
I don't believe in that
sort of thing, personally.

423
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,078
Astronomy is one
of the many tools of the devil.

424
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,500
You sure played great yesterday, Bobby.

425
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,252
What did my boy play great?

426
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:32,009
Waterboy. Yeah, waterboy.
He played... He played waterboy great.

427
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,804
Everybody who was thirsty
got a drink right away,

428
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,181
yesterday at the...
at the football game.

429
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,977
Foosball! Bunch of overgrown monsters
manhandling each other.

430
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,521
Remember when that man
wanted you to play?

431
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,734
Yeah, I... He... Roy Orbison...

432
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,361
Coach Klein. I remember.

433
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,073
So, Bobby, did they ever catch
that gorilla what escaped from the zoo

434
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,410
- and punched you in the eye?
- No, Mama, he...

435
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,454
The search continues.

436
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:08,295
What would you think if Bobby
did play football, Mrs. Boucher?

437
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,256
Well, I wouldn't
think much of it at all.

438
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,051
And to tell you the truth,
I don't think much of you

439
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,179
and all your snotty questions,
Miss Vallencourt.

440
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,474
I'm disturbed to see
that you're so interested in my boy.

441
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,728
I'm very, very interested
in your boy, Mrs. Boucher.

442
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,899
Really? Well, did he tell you
about how much his feet smell?

443
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,693
- Mama.
- He has to wear two pair of socks.

444
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,905
Well, men are supposed
to have stinky feet.

445
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,408
Are men supposed to wear pajamas
featuring a cartoon character

446
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,578
- by the name of Deputy Dawg?
- Mama, please.

447
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:45,248
Well, you know what?
I happen to find Deputy Dawg

448
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:49,544
to be very, very sexy.

449
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,339
Did he tell you about
his little bedtime problem?

450
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:56,426
- Mama, I'm beggin' you, don't.
- That's his sheet back there.

451
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,098
If you'll excuse me, ladies,
I'm gonna go hang myself.

452
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,683
- Now you see what you done?
- What I did?

453
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,395
You listen here, cupcake.
The only woman in my boy's life is me.

454
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,608
Nobody's gonna take him away, especially
not some godless Jezebel like you.

455
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:15,612
Oh, yeah? Well, your Bobby
is a grown man. And guess what?

456
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:19,282
- He can hang out with whoever he wants!
- He can. Whoever he wants.

457
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,829
'Cept you! Bobby,
that woman is the devil.

458
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,289
- I want you to stay away from her.
- Yes, Mama.

459
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:30,544
You come on inside before that
little ol' witch casts a spell on us!

460
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,133
I'm sorry, Vicki Vallencourt.

461
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,807
Whatever.

462
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,861
When  we report on the SCLSU
Mud Dogs here on SportsCenter,

463
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,613
it's to add a number
to their losing streak,

464
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:03,618
which now stands at 41 . But now, Bobby
Boucher has given us another reason.

465
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,246
In the Mud Dog's latest loss
this past Saturday,

466
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,291
the amazing 31-year-old freshman
set a new NCAA record

467
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:14,004
by sacking the quarterback 16 times,
shattering the old record of seven.

468
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,549
And, oh, by the  way, Bobby Boucher
is also the team's  waterboy,

469
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,676
which, of course, begs the question:

470
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,097
What exactly are they putting in the
water in Jackson's Bayou, Louisiana?

471
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,695
We're deadlocked at three
with less than a minute to go.

472
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,489
We are one family with one dream.

473
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:45,577
There are 40 of you on this team, not
one. Bobby can't do this by himself.

474
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:49,956
Get out and make something happen!
Sacrifice your bodies. Go, go, go!

475
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,502
Thank you. Bobby, you're gonna
have to do this by yourself

476
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,755
because nobody
on this team is any good.

477
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:01,134
Look, I can't stand losing anymore.
We've got to win one game.

478
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,512
Go out there and make something
happen. Visualize and attack.

479
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,891
- Visualize and attack. Please! Please!
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

480
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,229
Central Kentucky's down
to their third string quarterback.

481
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:16,691
Good ne ws, folks. Quarterback Tommy
Gardner does not have a broken neck.

482
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:20,403
Blue 52! Blue 52! Hut!

483
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,531
I forbid you to talk to
that enchantress. She's the devil!

484
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:27,494
She's not the devil. She's the most
beautiful woman in the world.

485
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,248
- I never said she was the devil.
- Most beautiful woman in the world!

486
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,916
Please, don't hurt me!

487
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,545
Follow the... Come on!

488
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,507
You crazy man! OK, OK, OK!

489
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,177
It's a safety!
They win, they win, they win!

490
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,430
With the help of Boucher,
the losing streak is over!

491
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,558
I'm so sorry, Mama.
Please forgive me.

492
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:54,020
I love you so much, Mama.
I love you.

493
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,316
- I love you too.
- We won! We won, baby!

494
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,443
It's gonna be a big party
and you going!

495
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:05,782
- Me? Party?
- Yeah, baby!

496
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,952
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

497
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,965
Hey. Nice suit.

498
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,634
Thank you. It was my daddy's.

499
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,513
Mama don't know I'm here,
but I took these outta the icebox:

500
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:32,100
- Louisiana frog cakes.
- Thanks.

501
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:35,895
- Come on in.
- Hey, Bobby Boucher!

502
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,648
Look who's here, Sergeant Stutter.

503
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,983
Want a beer?

504
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,485
I'll take a Scotch and water.
Hold the Scotch.

505
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,989
- You just make a joke, Bobby?
- Yes, I did.

506
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,074
Good one.

507
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:53,788
Now that you finally won a game, right,
you feel looser, the pressure is off.

508
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,499
And that will lead
to a lot more victories.

509
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,461
Yeah, that and the waterboy
getting 20 sacks a game.

510
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,795
That too.

511
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,841
Professor!

512
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,761
Havin' that test on amphibians
and reptiles Friday?

513
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,138
Yes, sir.

514
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,766
That is, if it's all right with you.

515
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:17,270
- Of course it is.
- My best regards to your dear mama.

516
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,607
Let's talk to the waterboy.

517
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,859
You played amazing
at the game today.

518
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:26,946
And you are so cute.
Is there a girl you're seein'?

519
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,532
Seein'?

520
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,035
I see a lot of girls.

521
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,371
I see a lot of guys too.

522
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,956
I think that's sexy.

523
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,542
Ever been with a guy and a girl
at the same time?

524
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,379
Oh, yeah, plenty of times.
The other night,

525
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,173
I was with my mama
and Coach Klein at the same time.

526
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,845
You are a bad boy.
I wish you were my boyfriend.

527
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,642
Oh, thank you, but, see,
there's this girl, Vicki Vallencourt.

528
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,686
She may be the devil.
Mama said that. Consequently,

529
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,106
I am prohibited from contact with her.

530
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,276
But I hope to get past that one day
'cause she's nice to talk to.

531
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,541
Yo, we have a very special
guest here today.

532
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:06,421
Let's have a warm L.T. welcome
for Bobby Boucher. Come on, Bobby.

533
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:10,091
- Thank you, Mr. Lawrence Taylor.
- Tell me, what is your secret?

534
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,635
How do you find yourself
in the right position?

535
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,762
That's a good question.

536
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,933
What happens is
the center has the ball first.

537
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,019
And the quarterback will say, "Hike."

538
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:24,814
That's when the center puts the ball
in the hands of the quarterback.

539
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,984
So, what I do is
I start tacklin' the quarterback,

540
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,987
unless he give the ball
to somebody else, in which case,

541
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,739
I try to tackle that person.

542
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:41,581
Gentleman, which brings me
to my next point: don't smoke crack.

543
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,134
Vicki Vallencourt.

544
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,678
What you doin' here?

545
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,680
Oh, nothin'.

546
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:02,101
I was just thinkin' about stealin'
L.T.'s Porsche over there.

547
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,187
But I suppose I ought to be
movin' on

548
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,523
before I get you in trouble
with your mama.

549
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:11,486
Well, Mr. Coach Klein said that
what Mama don't know won't hurt her.

550
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:16,366
So maybe we could ride home together.

551
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,203
- Really?
- If you'd like to.

552
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,997
OK.

553
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,747
Come sit down, if you'd like.

554
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,836
Vicki Vallencourt, I figured,

555
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,090
'cause you're interested in astrology
and mystical stuff like that,

556
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,342
you might appreciate this.

557
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,431
That's water from a glacier in Alaska.

558
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:26,102
It was blessed
by an Eskimo medicine man.

559
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,439
- It's cold!
- Yes, it's always cold.

560
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,941
That's why it's so special.

561
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,960
That was...
That... That happened...

562
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:55,089
That happened to be
my first time with lips

563
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:59,052
and... and... and... the tongue.

564
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:03,306
That was your tongue.
I... I believe it was.

565
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,141
I never did that before.

566
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,393
If that was your first kiss,

567
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,730
then I bet it's the first time
you've seen a pair of these.

568
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,654
Yes, yes, that is
another first for me,

569
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,741
and I appreciate what...
what you're showin' me right now.

570
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,747
Vicki Vallencourt, I think Mama's up.

571
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,419
Devil, devil, devil.

572
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,255
You better get goin'.

573
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,679
My God, Bobby. I mean, sometimes,
I just don't know why I bother with you.

574
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,389
You ain't even a man.

575
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,021
It looks like the Cinderella
S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs,

576
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:56,484
led by linebacker Bobby Boucher,
are gonna fall one victory short

577
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,529
of that Bourbon Bowl bid.
Iowa could win the game

578
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:03,116
- by nailing this 20-yard field goal.
- But the Mud Dogs have played

579
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,871
a sensational football game. Look at the
way Boucher entered the Hawkeyes' drive.

580
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,500
Here we see Boucher
instantly penetrating the pocket.

581
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,131
There's a lot of pain
and shame in those eyes.

582
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,966
Friends, it's all over.

583
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,553
- My leg!
- Wow, that is a disturbing image.

584
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,055
Difficult to watch, Chris.

585
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,100
Mud Dogs!

586
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,478
Gonna kick some names
and take some ass!

587
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,440
Bobby!

588
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:39,318
Water sucks. Gatorade is better.

589
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,238
- What?
- Use it on the field.

590
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:45,491
Waterboy, Waterboy, Waterboy!

591
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:58,129
Gatorade not only quenches your thirst
better, it tastes better too, idiot.

592
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,548
You're drinkin' the wrong water.

593
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:04,594
- Gatorade.
- H20.

594
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:09,098
- Gatorade!
- H20!

595
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,976
Water sucks
It really, really sucks

596
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,603
Water sucks

597
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:17,023
Stop saying that. You don't mean that.
You're bad people.

598
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:41,589
And my friend, Chris, the Mud Dogs
are goin' to the Bourbon Bowl.

599
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,220
With yesterday's come-from-behind
victory, the Mud Dogs

600
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,556
earned a Ne w Year's Day date
with Red Beaulieu and the Cougars

601
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,601
in the first Bourbon Bowl.
But not only has the  waterboy

602
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:56,979
changed S.C.L.S.U.'s fortunes,
he's got other teams looking

603
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:01,484
around the sidelines for talent.
In fact, Michigan, devastated by injury,

604
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,862
experimented  with their towel boy
at wide receiver.

605
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:09,242
But the towel boy ran into
a laundry list of problems.

606
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,016
You know, when I see
so many of you here tonight,

607
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:39,355
it reminds me just about how special
this season really was.

608
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:43,860
Notjust for the team.
Notjust for the students.

609
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:47,071
But for each and every one of you

610
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:50,575
in our small corner of Louisiana!

611
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,871
You can do it!

612
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:59,125
Oh, yes, we can,
and, yes, we will.

613
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,211
Because we've got a young man

614
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,631
who has been so vital to our success.

615
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,676
A wonderful student-athlete.

616
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,347
And a wonderful friend.

617
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,392
Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby Boucher!

618
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:26,527
- Waterboy, number one!
- You can do it!

619
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:37,246
Thank you so much
for bein' my friends.

620
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,334
You can do it!

621
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,921
I'd also like to take
this opportunity

622
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,215
to tell you that my mama
don't know how I play football.

623
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,427
So if you could not tell
my mama I play football,

624
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,929
that would be for the best.

625
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:16,285
We must be a little lost.
We're tryin' to get to the Bourbon Bowl.

626
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,538
Looks like we ended up
in Retardville, USA.

627
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:26,879
Hey, waterboy,
you fixin' to tackle all of us?

628
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:32,551
- Kick his water-lovin' ass, Greg.
- I asked you a question, dumbass.

629
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,140
You even exhale,
and I will saw your head off.

630
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,268
You can do it!
Cut his fucking head off!

631
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:46,816
Hold it, hold it. Just a minute.
Now what is the problem here, honey?

632
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,403
I mean, whatever it is,
we don't want this to get physical.

633
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,405
Right, Klein?

634
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,908
Your team actin'
like a bunch of shitheads.

635
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,996
Not how ambassadors for the University
of Louisiana are supposed to act.

636
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,540
So now you just get back on the bus.

637
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:10,006
However, assault with a deadly weapon,

638
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,299
very, very serious offense.

639
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:16,762
Officer, get her
little country ass outta here.

640
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,183
- Thank you, Vicki.
- Let's go.

641
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,898
It's the waterboy.

642
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,358
I got something for you.

643
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:34,196
This is his transcript
from South Lafayette High School

644
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,532
in Cherokee Plains, Louisiana.

645
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:39,201
Now the problem with that

646
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:44,206
is there ain't no South Lafayette High
School in Cherokee Plains, Louisiana.

647
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,293
So obviously, this is a fake!

648
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:52,882
However, this is not a fake.

649
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:55,342
This is from the NCAA.

650
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,054
They don't think you ought
to play football.

651
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,224
So allow me to say this
to you one more time:

652
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,226
You're fired.

653
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,354
Oh, no! We suck again!

654
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,231
Ever see a championship ring?

655
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,360
Don't be messin' with the champ.
Come on, Laski.

656
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:16,405
- You didn't go to high school?
- I was home-schooled.

657
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,325
- I didn't know I needed...
- Forged a fake transcript.

658
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:23,329
- No, I didn't.
- The waterboy's a cheater!

659
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,206
Cut his head off!

660
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,085
Listen, everybody!
This don't change nothin'!

661
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:32,379
We played as a team, we won as a team.

662
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,590
Just because the waterboy's a cheater

663
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,510
don't change the fact
that the real Mud Dogs

664
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,096
are gonna kick some Cougar ass.

665
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,431
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

666
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:47,061
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

667
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,279
Let's do it!

668
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,579
Sorry, Bobby.

669
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:17,007
Believe me, I understand.

670
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,677
Yeah, and you're
deeply appreciated, Mr. Dodd.

671
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:22,721
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

672
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,810
Good news. The NCAA is gonna
allow you to play in the Bourbon Bowl.

673
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,645
- Yes.
- You have to pass

674
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:34,692
- the high school equivalency test.
- It's not the test, coach.

675
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,945
Everybody... hates me.

676
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,657
That's not true.

677
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,910
One man said he wanted
to decapitate me.

678
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,831
Nobody else thought that
to be too bad of an idea.

679
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,003
Somebody made me look like a cheater.

680
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:57,673
I did it. I did it.
I did it! I did it! I did it!

681
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:01,635
- It was me.
- Why?

682
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:10,269
Because I wanted you to play.
Because you were my way out, Bobby.

683
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,522
It was the only way to get you in.

684
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,274
I am so sorry.

685
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,028
Why didn't you stick up for me
down by the river?

686
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,118
The truth is... I fled.

687
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,954
I came into my office,
I went under my desk, I cried.

688
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,957
I cried.
I cried like a ten-year-old girl!

689
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,091
Red and I have a history.

690
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:44,178
Twenty years ago,
we were assistants to Coach Cavanaugh

691
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:48,515
at the University of Louisiana.
Red ran the practices

692
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,769
and I used to come up with the plays.

693
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:55,147
Oh, boy, was I good.

694
00:53:56,233 --> 00:54:01,153
I  would  write these foolproof plays
in my little green notebook that I had.

695
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,906
The opposition
didn't even know what hit 'em.

696
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,034
And  when Coach Cavanaugh
was going to retire, me and Red,

697
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,954
we knew that one of us
was gonna be his successor.

698
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,668
- Hey, Red.
- How ya doin'?

699
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:21,090
- Come by to wish me luck?
- Well, not exactly, no, no.

700
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:25,344
Actually, I come by to get you
to do ol' Red a little favor.

701
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:29,265
- Sure. What's up?
- Well, you know that green notebook

702
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,684
you use to write all them
football plays in?

703
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:36,021
Well, I need to show Cavanaugh that
I can come up with some good play ideas.

704
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,190
But you didn't come up with them.

705
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,444
They're my plays. I need them.

706
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:48,117
Klein, I'm gonna have this book,
one way or another.

707
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:51,078
You might as well let the thing
go, 'cause if you don't,

708
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,956
it's gonna get awfully,
awfully physical here.

709
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,542
And I don't think
you want that, do you?

710
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,801
Of course, Red got the job.
Next day, fired me.

711
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,137
Once he had my notebook,
he didn't need me.

712
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,558
I didn't take it very well.

713
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:16,061
No, Grandma, I didn't get it.

714
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,605
I can't believe it myself.

715
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:22,568
I know. I'm so numb.

716
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,196
I just hate him,
I hate him, I hate him.

717
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,409
That is a terrible story, coach.

718
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,120
But why don't you just come up
with some new plays?

719
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,581
- I tried. I can't.
- Yes.

720
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,334
I guess I have a mental block
ever since

721
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,170
Red took my playbook
and my manhood.

722
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:44,381
I knew what he was gonna do!

723
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,843
And I just didn't fight back.

724
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:51,764
Well, you're gonna show him
that you're a man on Saturday.

725
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,187
I'm gonna show everybody that
I'm not a dummy. I'm gonna go study.

726
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:08,447
Mama, maybe you could stop
brushin' my hair so I can read.

727
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:12,701
Read? You don't have to read.

728
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:19,333
- What you readin' for?
- 'Cause I enjoys it, Mama.

729
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:23,003
Don't look like to me you enjoys it,
sittin' there all grouchy.

730
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,507
Mama, I gotta read this book
and six other books tonight,

731
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,717
or else I can't play foot...

732
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,807
- ...ball.
- Foosball?

733
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,893
You playin' the foosball behind my back?

734
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,562
The reason I'm doin' this
so I can go to school.

735
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:44,024
School?! You goin' to school?!

736
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,736
Sorry, Mama. I wanted to tell you.

737
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:52,157
You off gallivantin' with your fancy
foosball friends at school,

738
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:56,245
while I'm sittin' here all day
with nobody to keep me company

739
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,248
except Steve?

740
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,583
The chickens
are comin' home to roost.

741
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,670
You reap the fruit
of your selfish ways.

742
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,589
You're gonna lose all your
fancy foosball games

743
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,926
and you're gonna fail your big exam,
because school is...

744
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,928
The devil?

745
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:16,223
Everything is the devil to you, Mama!

746
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:19,935
Well, I like school
and I like football!

747
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:23,856
And I'm gonna keep doin' them both
because they make me feel good!

748
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:28,235
And by the way, Mama,
alligators are ornery

749
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,404
because of their medulla oblongata!

750
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:39,413
And I like Vicki,
and she likes me back!

751
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:42,249
And she showed me her boobies,
and I liked them too!

752
00:57:56,764 --> 00:58:00,184
The Louisiana High School
Equivalency Examination

753
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:03,896
consists of 300
multiple choice questions.

754
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,191
You have three hours.
Good luck to you, sir.

755
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:42,142
Ben Franklin.

756
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,772
Mama, when did Ben Franklin
invent electricity?

757
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,775
That's nonsense!
I invented electricity.

758
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,945
Ben Franklin is the devil!

759
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,500
I can't believe you got a 97!

760
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:10,629
I can't believe I told Mama
that I got feelings for you.

761
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,967
Well, welcome to your manhood,
Bobby Boucher.

762
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:18,095
When we get a little more time,
I'll welcome you properly.

763
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:21,306
Yes, once again, I'm not quite sure
what that means, but...

764
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,560
We should get goin'. I told Coach
I'd drive to the game with him.

765
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:32,150
I was with you from two to four
last night. You tell them.

766
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:38,240
Bobby, your mama got sick this mornin'.
She's in the hospital.

767
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:43,203
Mama, what have I done?

768
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,997
I'm so sorry, Mama.

769
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:52,087
Doctors say they can't figure out
what's wrong with her.

770
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,340
But I know what's wrong.

771
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,593
She got a broken heart
because of me.

772
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,761
Bobby, that's ridiculous.

773
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:03,890
Everybody else in this town
turn on me at the drop of a hat.

774
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:09,271
Mama is the only one who really cares
if I live or die.

775
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:13,567
She my whole world.
Will you just leave us alone?

776
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,904
She'll be fine, Bobby.
We better get going.

777
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,116
God knows what the team is doing
with Farmer Fran watching.

778
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,059
You really made it look like home.

779
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,276
How's that, Steve?

780
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:18,507
Take a look. The crowd has
never been bigger. Know  why?

781
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:23,136
Look who's on the television, Mama.
The devil.

782
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,806
...500,000 intimate friends...

783
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,610
Who that? Who there?

784
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:54,543
Three, two, one!

785
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:57,754
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year, Mama.

786
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:03,802
My resolution is to
never hurt you again.

787
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:17,983
Waterboy! Waterboy!

788
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:51,391
Bobby Boucher, all these folks
are here tonight

789
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,560
to tell you that they're sorry,

790
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:58,440
that they're sorry for not supportin'
you when it meant the most.

791
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:03,945
But you do have friends, and one of 'em
wants to say somethin'. Come on.

792
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:12,287
I am not what you would call
a handsome man.

793
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:15,123
The good Lord chose not
to bless me

794
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:19,461
with charm, athletic ability

795
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,922
or a fully functional brain.

796
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:27,427
You see, you're an inspiration

797
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:31,139
to all of us
who weren't born handsome

798
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:36,978
and charming and cool and...

799
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:44,820
- I can't! I can't!
- It's OK.

800
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:49,574
Bobby, if your mama could only hear us
right now, we would tell her

801
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,661
what a fine boy she raised,

802
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:56,832
and how much your playing football
means to this town.

803
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:01,461
But she can't hear you
'cause she's unconscious.

804
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:08,760
I'm sorry to disappoint you all,
but please keep your voices down

805
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,596
so my mama can get her rest.

806
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:23,441
Well, wake her ass up!
We gotta win tomorrow!

807
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:50,135
Mama! Thank God you're OK.
I'm so sorry.

808
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,679
I was so bad.
You were right about everything.

809
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:55,015
- I've been a knucklehead.
- Hush, baby.

810
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:59,603
You should've seen this
a long time ago.

811
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:03,231
- Oh, my word! Is that my daddy?
- No, no.

812
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:06,484
That's a guy I dated
before I met your father.

813
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,321
You could iron a shirt
on his stomach.

814
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:13,074
Well, that was lust, not love.
Turn the page.

815
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,496
There's your daddy.

816
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,707
So handsome.

817
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,043
Read on.

818
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,714
"Dear Helen." Who's Helen?

819
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,760
That's my first name, Bobby.

820
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,433
"I have arrived here in New Orleans.

821
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,603
It is even more beautiful
than in the picture book.

822
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:44,439
I'm sure I'll have
no problem finding work,

823
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:48,610
so you can expect my next letter
to contain lots of money.

824
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:52,781
Your loving husband, Robert."
That's nice, Mama.

825
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,202
"Dear Helen." That's you.

826
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,538
"I found a job as a lemonade vendor,

827
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,666
but sorry, no money yet.

828
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:05,418
New Orleans is an expensive city.

829
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:10,590
Expensive, but fun.
Hope all is well. Robert."

830
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,469
"To Whom It May Concern:

831
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:17,263
This will be my last letter.

832
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,809
We have grown apart
over these last six weeks.

833
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:25,105
I now have two loves in my life:

834
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:29,651
Big-city livin'
and a voodoo woman named Phyllis.

835
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:32,737
Ciao, Roberto."

836
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:36,324
He changed his name to Roberto.

837
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,827
I guess he thought it was more exotic.

838
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:41,830
But Mama says that...
I mean, you say that...

839
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:46,584
Bobby, your daddy
didn't go into no Peace Corps.

840
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,005
He deserted us, baby.

841
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:56,636
No, no, Mama. You shouldn't be dredgin'
up painful memories in your condition.

842
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,347
Hush. Your mama's
as healthy as an ox,

843
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,766
and as dumb as one to boot.

844
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,602
I was so scared you'd abandon me too.

845
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:09,941
And I made you abandon
all those people who depend on ya.

846
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,861
I hid you away from the world,
Bobby Boucher.

847
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:16,531
But I can't hog you
to myself no more,

848
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:19,701
because everyone's seen
how wonderful you are.

849
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,620
Oh, Mama!

850
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:25,790
Now...

851
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:31,212
You go play foosball
with your friends.

852
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,299
Welcome to ABC's coverage
of the Bourbon Bowl.

853
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,844
Good afternoon. I'm Brent Musburger
with my colleague Dan Fouts.

854
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:41,389
The big story here is a game
that's lost some of its luster

855
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:45,393
without its star player,
the waterboy, Bobby Boucher.

856
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:48,313
Red's got a couple
of solid early rounders out there.

857
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:52,484
I know, but I really wanted to scout
that waterboy. Reminds me of Greg Lloyd.

858
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,527
- Zack Thomas.
- Whatever.

859
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,362
Is she ready?

860
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:59,240
Oh, yeah. She's more than ready.

861
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,035
Come on, Bobby!
You'll miss the boat!

862
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,250
Let's go, ladies.

863
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,511
We are underway!
The opening kickoff is a beauty!

864
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:25,225
Holdsworth is gonna bring it out
from nine yards deep.

865
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:26,935
Come on.

866
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:28,353
Yeah!

867
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:33,108
They're showing no respect
for this team without Boucher.

868
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:37,278
Good reason, Brent.
109 yards untouched.

869
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:40,532
Touchdown, Cougars! They strike first.

870
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:51,459
Time running down in the first quarter.
Cougars lead is 17-nothing.

871
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,755
Set!

872
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,382
Three, 33!

873
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:01,761
Three, 33! Hut!

874
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:05,765
That quarterback can't
get the ball off before he's hit.

875
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:09,102
It's as if they're in
the offensive huddle with him.

876
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:15,567
Are you gonna finish
that hot dog, Jimmy?

877
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:16,818
Now I'm not.

878
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:19,946
Mama, you think
we'll make it on time?

879
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,908
Hang on! I'll show you what
A.J. Foyt taught me.

880
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:30,665
The end of the half.
The Cougars are dominating.

881
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:34,294
Let's hope the Mud Dogs
can make some adjustments.

882
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,671
Well, they better, because they suck.

883
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,470
Anybody got an idea?

884
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,268
Hey.

885
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,857
Remember the time Bobby tackled
the referee by mistake?

886
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,110
Yeah, that was pretty funny.

887
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,030
How about the time he tackled
the guy from Louisville

888
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:04,199
and threw him into the stands?

889
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:11,372
Y'all remember when he intercepted
the ball and his pants fell off?

890
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,375
And then he ran
for the touchdown bare-assed.

891
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,723
Remember when Bobby Boucher
showed up at halftime

892
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,683
and Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl?

893
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:41,736
Hey, sorry about givin' you
so much shit this year.

894
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,239
You're the heart and soul
of this team, Bobby.

895
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:47,033
The only one of us
who could've passed that test.

896
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:51,246
Thank you all so much
for being my friends.

897
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:55,416
Let's wait till later to hold hands
and kiss. We got a bowl game to win.

898
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,752
- Yeah!
- Two, three!

899
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:58,795
Mud Dogs!

900
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:04,801
In a dramatic turn of events,
Bobby Boucherjust arrived at halftime.

901
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:09,430
And on a fan boat, Brent. His mother
drove him right into the stadium.

902
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,359
Waterboy! Waterboy!

903
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:30,660
Foosball's not for the devil.

904
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:32,453
It's for my Bobby.

905
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,665
Time to open up some whoop-ass.

906
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:46,592
Shit, he showed up.
All right, look.

907
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,428
Just relax. Relax.

908
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:51,306
Go in there and do exactly
like we planned. Go, go, go!

909
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,725
This could be the start
of some high drama.

910
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:58,980
Or are the Mud Dogs too far behind?
Bobby Boucher is on defense.

911
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:02,650
The Cougars are coming out
from their own 20-yard line.

912
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,194
The pitch. It's a reverse!

913
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,822
Boucher's not fooled.

914
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:10,241
Fumble! Robideaux's got it!

915
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,410
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

916
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:18,416
- Boucher knocked the poop out of him.
- "Poop"?

917
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:23,671
Slap hands! Slap hands!

918
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:29,677
Drink up, now. I want you girls
to sober up. Have faith in my Bobby.

919
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:33,306
The Mud Dogs are faced
with yet another third and long.

920
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:35,808
- Hut!
- Grenouille back to pass.

921
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:38,561
He's gonna be stuffed again!
The Mud Dogs offense

922
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:42,398
is still unable to move that ball.
But the way their defense is fired up,

923
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:45,193
they still have a shot
at winning this game.

924
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:47,737
Look. Now what ifwe...

925
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,118
Trust me. Go, go, go, go, go.

926
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:59,874
The Cougars lead 27-7
in the middle of the third quarter.

927
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,793
And he takes a knee?

928
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,462
Y'all gonna play or what?

929
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,050
How do you all like my new offense?

930
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:16,015
All right, it's second and 12,
as the Cougars line up on the ball.

931
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:23,147
What is Red Beaulieu doing,
refusing to play offense?

932
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,025
- Dan, this is bizarre.
- No, it's not, Brent.

933
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,404
It's brilliant. Red is
taking the Waterboy out of the game.

934
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,073
By kneeling down
three times and punting,

935
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:34,200
he'll make the Mud Dog
offense try to beat him.

936
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:36,702
The way they're playing,
that's impossible.

937
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,871
The Mud Dog's most valuable player,

938
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:42,083
the linebacker they call "The Waterboy,"
is now powerless.

939
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:46,963
That means Coach Klein will have
to find another way to outfox Red.

940
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,342
Mud Dogs call a timeout.

941
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:56,055
Mr. Coach Klein. Mr. Coach Klein!
Mr. Coach Klein!

942
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:01,769
- Where are you going?
- I was just gonna get a hot pretzel.

943
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:04,772
Mr. Coach Klein,
are you afraid of Red Beaulieu?

944
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,445
I am petrified of him.

945
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:13,614
Well, why don't you pretend
that Red Beaulieu

946
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,908
is somebody that you're not afraid of.

947
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:18,453
- Pretend?
- Yes.

948
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,955
Visualize somebody you're not afraid of.

949
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:24,625
- And then attack, like you told me.
- I'll try.

950
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,169
He's right over there.

951
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:42,894
Little baby. Yeah.

952
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:46,314
Hello, little baby.

953
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:54,322
A poo-poo?
Do you have a poo-poo?

954
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:58,826
Yes. OK. Now.

955
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,787
This is what we're gonna do.
He's gonna come here...

956
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,590
Come and get this one, Cougars.

957
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:15,426
Red 22! Hike!

958
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:18,179
Snap to Grenouille. A reverse!

959
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:22,016
No, it's a double reverse!
Oh, what a block!

960
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:26,187
And Bugge springs free!
Trouble! Lateral!

961
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,856
Got him! What a play!

962
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:32,068
Grenouille to the 15, the ten,
the five!

963
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:35,196
- Touchdown, Mud Dogs!
- Well, well, well.

964
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,949
Coach Klein does have
a few tricks up his sleeve.

965
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:41,327
What the hell...
What the hell is this?

966
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:45,039
We go from a championship
football team to a bunch of dogs!

967
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:48,626
Right now, we're going to go
to the sidelines and Lynn Swann.

968
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,796
- What do you have for us?
- I'm with Vicki Vallencourt,

969
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,966
taking over Bobby Boucher's
water duties for this game.

970
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:58,970
I'm not takin' over.
I'm just tryin' not to screw up too bad.

971
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:02,390
Let me ask you. What's your prediction
for the rest of this game?

972
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:05,935
- Mud Dogs are gonna win, 30-27.
- That's very interesting.

973
01:16:06,019 --> 01:16:09,730
- How'd you come up with that guess?
- Guess? That ain't no guess!

974
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,400
- That's what it's gonna be.
- OK. That's fine.

975
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:14,110
Be careful down there.

976
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,991
All right. Where's Meaney?

977
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,118
- Meaney?
- Here, coach.

978
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:24,787
Get in there and see
if that waterboy can stop you.

979
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:25,871
- Yes, sir!
- Go!

980
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:31,460
Red is sending his best defender in as a
running back? What do you make of this?

981
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:34,463
He's gotta find some way
to neutralize the Waterboy.

982
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:37,091
He probably thinks Meaney
will pound it in there

983
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:40,052
- like Fridge did for the Bears.
- Hey, Waterboy!

984
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,430
Is your girlfriend
gonna save you again?

985
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:45,266
No. I'll take matters
into my own hands. You'll see.

986
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,435
Bring it to the hole!
Your ass is mine!

987
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:54,108
You sound like a big choo-choo train.

988
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:07,371
Power bomb,
compliments of Captain Insano.

989
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:17,298
All right, field goal.
Field goal. Go.

990
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:20,593
- Derek. Derek!
- Yeah.

991
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:23,804
Visualize the attack.
Go kick the ball. Kick it.

992
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,723
Hut!

993
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:29,435
How you doin', boy?

994
01:17:29,519 --> 01:17:31,062
No, no, no!

995
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:58,589
What the hell is that?

996
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:07,807
What the hell is he up to?
That ain't in here!

997
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:14,772
Down by ten late in the fourth quarter,
Coach Klein opts for the field goal.

998
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:18,567
They have to hope for the onside kick
and a touchdown to tie the game.

999
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:22,988
Dan, look what we have here.
Boucher's in the game as a blocker.

1000
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:26,450
Last game of the year.
Can't hold anything back now.

1001
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:29,328
Set!

1002
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,501
The snap. It's a fake!

1003
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:42,967
Boucher's out in front!
A great block!

1004
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:47,138
And a second one!
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

1005
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:50,349
Boucher led him all the way!

1006
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:56,230
Red Beaulieu is steaming, Dan.

1007
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:58,899
He sees his perfect season
slipping away.

1008
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:02,778
The Cougars' lead is down to three.

1009
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:10,578
Mud Dogs need the ball if they're
gonna have a shot at overtime.

1010
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:14,165
And Bobby Boucher
is now on the kickoff team.

1011
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:17,001
Last game of the year.
Can't hold anything back.

1012
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,085
I know.

1013
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,505
Who's it gonna be?

1014
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:25,342
Who's it gonna be?
Who's it gonna be?

1015
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:31,599
Oh, yeah. There's my bitch.

1016
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,851
The ball must travel ten yards.

1017
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:38,773
It's loose!

1018
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:41,942
- Mud Dogs football! Mud Dogs football!
- All right!

1019
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:45,112
- Mama, I got the football! I got it...
- What a vicious hit!

1020
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:46,947
That was a cheap shot.

1021
01:19:50,076 --> 01:19:54,789
What a dumb penalty. That puts the Mud
Dogs in field goal range for the tie.

1022
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:58,459
- I'm not sure Boucher can get up.
- Oh, my baby!

1023
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:06,717
It's still cold.

1024
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:10,513
Excuse me. Out of my way.

1025
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:16,227
Dan, you hate to see this happen.

1026
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:28,155
Now that's high quality H20.

1027
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:32,243
You go on, now!
Make it happen, Bobby!

1028
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,499
The Waterboy just needed some water.

1029
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:41,752
Wow, Dan. You think that up
all by yourself?

1030
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,212
Shut up, Brent.

1031
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:49,844
- You OK?
- He tried to open a can ofwhoop-ass.

1032
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:53,055
- I wouldn't let him.
- I have an idea for the last play.

1033
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:56,892
You haven't done this before.
The offense is gonna line up like this.

1034
01:20:56,977 --> 01:21:00,604
- You're gonna be right here.
- There'll be no tie here today.

1035
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:04,358
Coach Klein is sending
his offense back onto the field.

1036
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:08,779
- He's going for the win right now.
- This is a real gutsy call, Brent.

1037
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,615
He'll either be a hero
or a goat because of this.

1038
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,119
And Dan,
Bobby Boucher is back on the field.

1039
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:19,373
He is now playing offense!
We know. We know.

1040
01:21:19,457 --> 01:21:22,626
Meaney, if they give
that Waterboy the football,

1041
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:27,047
I don't care if you have to stab him!
Do not let him get away. Understand?

1042
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:31,051
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir!
- Do you understand me? Get in there!

1043
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,595
Break!

1044
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,814
- I'm ready, friend.
- Let's do it, Bobby.

1045
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,902
Set! Set!

1046
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:51,488
Forty-three! Red 43!
Hut, hut!

1047
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:11,735
Touchdown! They won it!
The Mud Dogs win it!

1048
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:16,115
Bobby Boucher's the hero!
He's gone from waterboy to savior!

1049
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:18,325
Because he didn't
hold anything back!

1050
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:23,122
Swannie's down on the field
with our hero, so let's go to Lynn now!

1051
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:28,377
We did it! I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!

1052
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:32,006
- Vicki, I love you!
- I love you, too, baby.

1053
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,924
We're the champions!

1054
01:23:35,927 --> 01:23:39,847
Mr. Coach Klein, you got your manhood!
You got your manhood!

1055
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:43,642
Bobby, congratulations.
You're the MVP of the Bourbon Bowl.

1056
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:47,396
- How do you feel?
- I love Mama!

1057
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,793
- Way to go, Bobby.
- Lookin' sharp, Bobby.

1058
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,462
You the man, Bobby!

1059
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:14,548
Bobby, I've been dreading
this day for a long time.

1060
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:18,052
- But you got yourself a fine woman.
- Thank you, Mama.

1061
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:21,096
Good luck, son.

1062
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:23,140
This is the best day of my life!

1063
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:28,729
- You just wait till tonight.
- What's gonna happen tonight?

1064
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:31,065
- You'll see.
- You can do it!

1065
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:35,027
You can do it all night long!

1066
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:41,366
I'm gonna go do it!

1067
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:49,750
Bobby, it's me!

1068
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:52,878
- Your daddy, Roberto.
- Daddy?

1069
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:56,256
I've seen you on the ESPN
when they was talkin' about

1070
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:59,551
- you being drafted by the NFL.
- Not going to the NFL.

1071
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:02,221
I'm gonna stay in school and graduate.

1072
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:06,183
The hell with school, dopey! Take the
money! You and me could be partners,

1073
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:09,686
just like that Tiger Woods
and his daddy.

1074
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:21,448
- Nice hit, Mama.
- Thanks, baby.

1075
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,992
Now you go on and have some fun
becoming a man.

1075
01:25:24,305 --> 01:26:24,204
