1
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:37,010
<i>It's in the center of the circle in
Kingfisher County, moving northeast.</i>

2
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:41,611
<i>Also, I do want to say to you folks
back to the West, a little bit earlier-</i>

3
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:45,504
<i>Tornado warning continues now
and has been extended officially.</i>

4
00:01:45,546 --> 00:01:49,508
<i>I gave this to you earlier.
It's extended over into Oklahoma Cou-</i>

5
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:54,180
<i>They're calling all of
Oklahoma County right now...</i>

6
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,740
Jo common.

7
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,744
- What is it, Mommy?
- We have to get up.

8
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:18,746
We must go to the storm cellar!

9
00:02:18,996 --> 00:02:20,748
What's happening?

10
00:02:20,998 --> 00:02:21,749
Come on, sweetie.

11
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:23,793
Hurry!

12
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:26,754
Mommy's got you.

13
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:28,756
TV says it's big.

14
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:33,511
We're going to the storm cellar.

15
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:37,765
We must move! Hand her to me!

16
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:42,520
Come on! Let's move.

17
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:49,527
Go to the center of your
house if there's no cellar.

18
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:59,495
My Lord!

19
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:03,749
Come on!

20
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:05,751
We're almost there!

21
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,753
Take her! Take her!

22
00:03:08,003 --> 00:03:10,506
I'll get the door!

23
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:13,759
- Get in!
- Hurry!

24
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,761
It's coming!

25
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:16,762
Quick!

26
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:21,517
Light the lamp!

27
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:26,772
Daddy! Toby's still outside!

28
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:28,774
Toby, come on, boy!

29
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:29,775
Good boy!

30
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:34,530
It's okay, Toby.

31
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:43,789
Grab Jo!

32
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,544
Daddy!

33
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:55,551
Take Jo!

34
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:04,768
God!

35
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:08,772
I can't hold it.

36
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:12,776
Jesus! Oh, God!

37
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:16,530
I can't hold it!

38
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:41,555
Stay with me, Jo!

39
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:18,550
At 7 a. m. in Oklahoma City,
the temperature is 75 degrees.

40
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:29,812
Look, caps are already
starting to break.

41
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:34,817
All the models are forecasting
lifted indices from -6 to -10.

42
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:39,780
If the cells keep building, there could be
a record outbreak of tornados.

43
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,576
This is going to be a long day.

44
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,813
Are you sure she'll be there?

45
00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:15,816
If I know Jo, she's already dragged
her department into the field.

46
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:20,821
Day like today, it's to be expected.
She forgets everything except work.

47
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:21,822
You're nervous.

48
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:23,824
Nervous?

49
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:24,825
No.

50
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:26,827
Do I look nervous?

51
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:27,828
No.

52
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:31,790
Well, yeah, you do a little. You know.

53
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,791
I want to get it over with.

54
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,836
She said she signed the papers?

55
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:37,838
That's what she said.

56
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:40,799
You don't think so?

57
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:42,801
I think so.

58
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:46,555
Give me a kiss.

59
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:56,565
Okay, Professor! Hang on there.
I think I fixed it.

60
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,817
I got it.

61
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:00,819
Fuck me! This thing is useless!

62
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:04,573
Sorry!

63
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:05,824
Wait, wait!

64
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:08,827
Good! Give me a reading!

65
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:13,832
Okay, boss lady, hold your horses.

66
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:15,834
Which way do you want it?

67
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,836
The dry line is stalled.

68
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:25,594
Scan WNW, look at mid-levels for
rotation, and increase the P.R.F.

69
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:28,805
If I mistreat you girl

70
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:33,560
Sure don't mean no harm

71
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:42,819
All I'm saying is, don't fold the maps.

72
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,821
I didn't.

73
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:47,824
Kansas is a mess. There's a
big crease through Wichita.

74
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:52,579
Roll the maps.

75
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,584
The storm chasers.

76
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:01,838
Who's that handsome devil?

77
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,840
Gentlemen.

78
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:07,844
The Extreme! It's the Extreme!

79
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:10,847
Don't start that shit.

80
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:15,852
A manly handshake ensues.
How you doing, man?

81
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:17,854
I'm doing great.

82
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:20,857
Oh, man!

83
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:24,861
I'd like you to meet Melissa.
This is Dusty.

84
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:28,824
Dustman's been chasing
with us since we started.

85
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,826
Listen...

86
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:32,828
...where's Jo?

87
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:35,831
She's by the Doppler.

88
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:38,834
Broke down again.
Running out of grant money.

89
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:42,838
Why don't you hang out here for a
little while. I'll be right back.

90
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:46,842
Dusty, why don't you
explain to Melissa...

91
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:50,846
...why you're the way you are.

92
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:53,849
Come on.

93
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:56,852
Man, Jo's going to wig
when she sees he's back.

94
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:58,854
I'm not back.

95
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:02,607
The prodigal son returns.

96
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,614
Hi, Joey.

97
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:19,583
Hiya, Jo.

98
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:22,836
I'm happy you found us.

99
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:25,839
How you doing?

100
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:26,840
It's going good.

101
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,844
You see the sky today?

102
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:32,846
She's really talking.

103
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:34,848
Catch.

104
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:39,853
It's the biggest series of storms in
12 years. One lined up after another.

105
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:41,855
N.S.S.L.'s never seen anything like it.

106
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:44,858
Is that right? So, Jo,
about the divorce papers-

107
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:46,860
Do you have a sec?

108
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,614
Excuse me.

109
00:09:51,114 --> 00:09:52,866
This thing's acting up again.

110
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:54,868
The focus mount's jammed.

111
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:57,871
There's grass in the auto-focus.

112
00:09:58,121 --> 00:09:58,872
Should I clean it?

113
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:01,875
Not unless you want to sketch tornados.

114
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:02,876
Welcome back.

115
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:05,879
I'm not back.

116
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:09,841
You want the papers?

117
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:11,843
I came here for them.

118
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:13,845
They're signed and ready.

119
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:14,846
Good. Let's see them.

120
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:16,848
Right now?

121
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:17,849
That'd be nice.

122
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,852
What's the urgent urgency?
You act like you're getting married.

123
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:24,606
I am.

124
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:35,867
Is it Melinda?

125
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:36,868
Melissa.

126
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,870
Wasn't there a Melinda somewhere?

127
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,872
There's only been Melissa since you.

128
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:43,875
Not much for browsing, are you?

129
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,629
I guess I'm not.

130
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:51,633
There you go.

131
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:07,857
You missed a page.

132
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:11,611
Right here.

133
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:18,618
Where'd this come from?

134
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,870
What're you doing?

135
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,872
Can I read it first?

136
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:24,874
It's the same as December.

137
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:25,875
I didn't read it then.

138
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:29,879
Christ, would you sign it
so we can get out of here?

139
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:30,880
Please.

140
00:11:31,131 --> 00:11:32,882
"We?" She's here?

141
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:36,886
She's with Dusty. Now,
please, sign the document.

142
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:38,888
With Dusty? What's wrong with you?

143
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,890
I want to meet her.

144
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:41,891
No, you don't.

145
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:45,895
Christ.

146
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:48,898
The suck zone.

147
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:51,901
It's the point...

148
00:11:52,152 --> 00:11:54,904
...basically at which the twister...

149
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:55,905
...sucks you up.

150
00:11:56,156 --> 00:12:00,869
That's not the technical
term for it, obviously.

151
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:01,870
I'm Jo Harding.

152
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,872
Nice to meet you.

153
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:05,874
Bill told me the happy news.

154
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:08,877
- Which?
- Us. Marriage. Jo, Melissa.

155
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:10,879
It's happy news.

156
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:12,881
I guess it seems sudden.

157
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:13,882
Sudden?

158
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:16,885
Dude, you're taking the vows?
That's sweet.

159
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:20,889
We wanted to get it done before
Billy started his new job.

160
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:22,891
That's right. Weatherman.

161
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:24,893
What?

162
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:25,894
- Don't say it.
- I said, weatherman.

163
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:27,896
- It's great.
- You have that tone.

164
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:29,898
If you have a problem-

165
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:35,653
I don't have a problem
being a weatherman.

166
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:38,907
Dr. Melissa Reeves.

167
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:40,909
Very nice to meet you.

168
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,662
You too.

169
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:49,876
New truck?

170
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:50,877
That's right.

171
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:53,880
Boy, oh, boy. New job...

172
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,882
...new truck...

173
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:57,884
...new wife. It's a whole new you.

174
00:12:58,134 --> 00:12:59,886
This is awkward.

175
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:00,887
Tell me.

176
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:02,889
I thought you'd come alone.

177
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,891
You said you'd meet me-

178
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:06,893
It's about Dorothy.

179
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:08,895
Dorothy?

180
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:11,898
What about her?

181
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:14,901
She's here.

182
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:18,655
Show me.

183
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,918
I can't believe you did it.

184
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:34,879
We built 4.

185
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:38,633
She work?

186
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:50,895
Thought you'd want to be
here for her first time out.

187
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:54,899
It wouldn't be right
if you weren't here.

188
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:57,902
This is going to be good!

189
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:00,905
How sweet is that?

190
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:02,907
It's Bill's concept.

191
00:14:03,157 --> 00:14:05,910
The Extreme. It came from his brain.

192
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,912
I had a hand in it.

193
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:10,915
It is great.

194
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:12,917
What is it?

195
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:16,921
It's an instrument pack for studying
tornados. First one in history.

196
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:17,922
It's very exciting.

197
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:20,925
Scientists have studied
tornados forever...

198
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:23,928
...but nobody knows
how a tornado works.

199
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:25,930
We don't know what happens inside...

200
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,892
...because nobody can take
measurements inside the funnel.

201
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,895
That's what she's going to do.

202
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:33,896
How?

203
00:14:34,147 --> 00:14:36,899
We put her up inside a tornado.

204
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,652
She opens...

205
00:14:41,154 --> 00:14:43,906
...and releases hundreds
of these sensors...

206
00:14:44,157 --> 00:14:47,910
...that measure all parts of
the tornado simultaneously.

207
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:50,913
You see, it's like this:

208
00:14:51,164 --> 00:14:53,916
These sensors go up the funnel
and radio back information...

209
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:57,920
...about the internal structure,
wind velocities...

210
00:14:58,171 --> 00:15:00,923
We'll learn more in 30 seconds
than in the last 30 years.

211
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:02,925
Get a profile for the first time.

212
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:04,927
What will that do?

213
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:08,931
If we know how tornados work,
we can design a warning system.

214
00:15:09,182 --> 00:15:10,933
Aren't there warnings already?

215
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:13,936
- The civil defence-
- They're not good enough.

216
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:14,937
Right now it's 3 minutes.

217
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:18,941
If we can get this information,
we can increase it to 15.

218
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:21,944
Give people a chance to get to safety.

219
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:26,657
That's what they're trying to do.

220
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:31,913
I can't believe you did it.

221
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:35,917
Well, we did it.

222
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:39,921
How do you get it in?

223
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:42,924
You get in front of it and
put it in the damage path.

224
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:44,926
And then get out again quickly.

225
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:47,929
That's the suck zone.

226
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:49,931
Excellent! We got major action!

227
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:56,687
N.S.S.L. says the cap is breaking,
towers are going up 30 miles.

228
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,942
Let's go.

229
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:01,943
We're moving!

230
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:03,945
It's fatty time!

231
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:05,947
Laptop.

232
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:10,701
We're waiting! Let's go!

233
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:15,665
Joey, Haynes, a little help!

234
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:23,965
Smooth.

235
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:25,967
There's Dusty!

236
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:28,928
Come on! You're always last!
Let's go!

237
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:32,932
We're going third. Preacher follow.

238
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:33,933
Get the camera!

239
00:16:34,183 --> 00:16:34,934
I got it!

240
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:38,938
They can handle this.
They know what they're doing.

241
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:41,941
This is what they do.

242
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:42,942
They live for this.

243
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:44,944
Dorothy 2 & 3 ready.

244
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:46,946
Dorothy 4 ready.

245
00:16:47,196 --> 00:16:49,949
Sure you don't want to go?

246
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:51,951
Go with them?

247
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:55,705
No, they'll be fine.

248
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:58,958
- Did she sign the papers?
- Shit!

249
00:16:59,208 --> 00:16:59,917
She didn't?

250
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:01,919
Hurry. We can catch them!

251
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:03,921
Glad you're back!

252
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:05,923
I'm not back!

253
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:06,924
Rabbit.

254
00:17:07,174 --> 00:17:08,926
Yeah, boss?

255
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:13,681
Can we do better than the 30?

256
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:18,936
Not for a while. It's best to stay
on it until we pass the creek.

257
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:21,939
Copy that.

258
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,942
Once we catch up to them,
take the truck and go home.

259
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:28,946
I'll get them signed, see you tonight.

260
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:34,702
This is interesting.
I'm going to tag along.

261
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:51,969
Jonas! Son-of-a-bitch!

262
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:53,971
Who is that?

263
00:17:54,221 --> 00:17:56,974
Jonas Miller. He's a night crawler.

264
00:17:57,224 --> 00:18:01,937
We all started out in the same lab, then
Jonas got himself corporate sponsors.

265
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:04,940
He's in it for the money,
not the science.

266
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:06,942
He's got a lot of high-tech gadgets.

267
00:18:07,193 --> 00:18:10,946
But he's got no instincts.

268
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:15,701
And he doesn't have Dorothy.

269
00:18:17,203 --> 00:18:21,707
I think we have fleas.

270
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:24,960
Jo, come back.

271
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:26,962
You change your mind?

272
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:31,717
Yeah. Why's Jonas here?

273
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:35,971
I'm not sure.

274
00:18:36,222 --> 00:18:41,727
I bet he's asking himself
the same thing about you.

275
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:46,732
Shit! Hold on!

276
00:18:48,234 --> 00:18:52,696
God damn! Son-of-a-bitch!

277
00:18:58,244 --> 00:18:59,954
This essentially was a false alarm.

278
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:04,708
The radar appeared solid.

279
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,963
- How long till it's fixed?
-10 minutes, 15 tops.

280
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:10,965
Sounds good.

281
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:13,968
What drives me is the unknown.

282
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:16,971
What if we could predict
the tornado's path?

283
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:19,974
How many lives would be spared
by an early warning system?

284
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:21,976
And D.O.T. 3...

285
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:22,977
...is the answer.

286
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:28,732
The first digital
orthographic telemeter.

287
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:33,988
Inside, she holds hundreds
of these sensors which...

288
00:19:34,238 --> 00:19:38,993
...when released into the tornado,
transmit back data on wind speed...

289
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,953
...pressure and dew point temperature.

290
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:42,997
Why didn't you tell me?

291
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:46,000
Don't.

292
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,003
And what will soon be the
center for all studies.

293
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,005
You shit!

294
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:54,008
Think I wouldn't find out?!

295
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:55,968
Get him off me!

296
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:57,970
What's wrong?

297
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,971
What's the matter?

298
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:01,974
You stole my design, you bastard!

299
00:20:02,224 --> 00:20:03,976
What do you mean?!

300
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:07,980
Dorothy. You took her, you damn thief!

301
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,984
Oh, I get it. You want to
take credit for my design.

302
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:13,986
You're a liar.

303
00:20:14,236 --> 00:20:15,988
She was our idea.

304
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:17,990
Unrealised idea.

305
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,991
Unrealised.

306
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:21,994
That ain't worth shit unless it flies!

307
00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:24,997
Guys! Guys! All my guys,
get a grip on yourself.

308
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:28,000
We both know he'll never
get it up in the air.

309
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,962
Well, let me enlighten you people!

310
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:33,964
This baby has satellite comlink.

311
00:20:34,214 --> 00:20:37,009
We got on-board pulse Doppler.

312
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:39,011
We got Nexrad real time.

313
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:41,972
We're going to make history.

314
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:43,974
So stick around.

315
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:46,977
The days of sniffing the dirt are over.

316
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:47,978
Better than what you sniff.

317
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:50,981
We'll see who gets there first, pal.

318
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:52,983
By the way...

319
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:56,987
...I really enjoy your weather reports.

320
00:20:57,237 --> 00:20:58,989
You slime!

321
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:01,992
Come here!

322
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:05,746
Get off!

323
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:11,752
He's a corporate kiss-butt.

324
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:16,006
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

325
00:21:16,256 --> 00:21:17,007
One day.

326
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:21,011
I'll give you one day.
Whether she flies or not, I'm gone.

327
00:21:21,261 --> 00:21:23,013
Honey?

328
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:24,014
Is everything okay?

329
00:21:24,264 --> 00:21:26,016
- Everything's fine.
- Are you sure?

330
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:29,019
Yeah, everything's okay.

331
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:33,982
I'm going to hang out here.
Why don't you get us some cold drinks?

332
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:37,736
Okay, sweetheart.

333
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:08,016
Jo, I don't know what's wrong
with Bill. He's wacko. He's crazy.

334
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:09,017
You ought to get a leash on him.

335
00:22:09,268 --> 00:22:11,019
He's your problem, not mine.

336
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,023
This storm's going to be a lot
bigger than we anticipated.

337
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:19,027
I got reports of mesos from
Grand County to Logan.

338
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:22,030
Sharing information with me?

339
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:26,034
No, I was curious as to which
way you were going to head.

340
00:22:26,285 --> 00:22:28,996
Southeast, I think.

341
00:22:29,246 --> 00:22:30,998
To the counter.

342
00:22:31,248 --> 00:22:35,752
Two lemonades to go, please.

343
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:40,007
- Nothing changes.
- Pardon me?

344
00:22:40,257 --> 00:22:42,009
He'll wait and see what Bill does.

345
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:45,012
May I have a coffee to go?

346
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:49,766
That man is waiting for Bill?
Why?

347
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:20,047
You're telling me that Billy
knows what a storm is thinking?

348
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:24,009
Something like that. Gum?

349
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:27,012
My aunt called him a human barometer.

350
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:30,015
He hasn't really told me about all this.

351
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:37,773
If you must pee, do it now. There's not
many places to stop on the road.

352
00:23:39,274 --> 00:23:43,779
You're still in love with him.

353
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:50,035
Check, please.

354
00:23:50,285 --> 00:23:52,037
Not that I blame you.

355
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:58,794
I hope this isn't a desperate
attempt to keep him in your life.

356
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:03,799
We're together.

357
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:14,017
Hey, man.

358
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:17,771
What's up?

359
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:21,024
Going green.

360
00:24:21,274 --> 00:24:22,025
Greenage.

361
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:25,028
- Saddle them up.
- You got it, boss.

362
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,032
I need a sector scan on that cell.
Keep looking for a hook.

363
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:31,034
What are my dew points doing?

364
00:24:31,284 --> 00:24:33,036
Points up to 70, sir.

365
00:24:33,286 --> 00:24:34,037
I got a lemonade.

366
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:38,041
We must go. Follow us in the
truck, but stay behind Dusty.

367
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:42,045
You'll be safe there. I must go with Jo.
Let's move out, people!

368
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:45,799
Where are we going?

369
00:24:49,302 --> 00:24:53,807
Thanks, I'll drive.

370
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:59,771
Let's pack it up. Let's go.

371
00:25:10,282 --> 00:25:15,787
It's a wonder of nature baby!

372
00:25:39,311 --> 00:25:43,815
Hey, you guys!

373
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:10,050
Dr. Melissa Reeves here.

374
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,052
Hello, Donald.

375
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:16,806
No, you got me in my car.

376
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:19,059
Oklahoma

377
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:23,063
Where the wind comes
sweeping down the plain

378
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:24,064
And the waving wheat

379
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:29,069
This feeling of inadequacy is coming
from you. Julia doesn't resent you.

380
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:32,072
We've talked about this before.

381
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:35,075
She did not marry your penis.

382
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:41,831
Okay. All right.
She didn't only marry your penis.

383
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:45,085
So?

384
00:26:45,335 --> 00:26:47,087
So...

385
00:26:47,295 --> 00:26:49,047
Amazing coloring there, isn't it?

386
00:26:49,297 --> 00:26:51,049
Look at the mammatas.

387
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:54,052
Those tops have got to be
spiking about 40,000 feet.

388
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:59,057
- It's a good thing.
- It's a very good thing.

389
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:01,059
You met her at the station?

390
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:04,062
- I don't want to fight.
- I'm not fighting. I'm talking.

391
00:27:04,312 --> 00:27:07,816
I don't want to fight.

392
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:11,069
She's nice.

393
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,071
She's not nice?

394
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:15,073
- I know what you meant.
- You do?

395
00:27:15,323 --> 00:27:16,074
Don't do this.

396
00:27:16,324 --> 00:27:21,079
I'm making civilised conversation here.
You're biting my head off.

397
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:23,081
Jesus.

398
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:26,084
Yes, she's very nice.

399
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:31,840
No, she does not work at the station.

400
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,803
She's a therapist.

401
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:42,058
Yours?

402
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:44,060
You couldn't resist it.

403
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,063
I'm not saying you need therapy.

404
00:27:47,313 --> 00:27:49,065
Wait. I need therapy?

405
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:50,066
I didn't say that.

406
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:52,068
Why would I need a therapist?

407
00:27:52,318 --> 00:27:55,071
- I don't know.
- You're the doctor.

408
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:58,074
I don't know...

409
00:27:58,324 --> 00:28:00,076
...inability to finish things.

410
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:03,079
Maybe rushing into things
you can't quite commit to.

411
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:04,080
You asked me.

412
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,082
You asked me!

413
00:28:06,332 --> 00:28:10,086
Bullshit! I may have walked out, but at
least I showed up in the first place!

414
00:28:10,336 --> 00:28:13,089
- You never had an idea.
- There's a road thing going on.

415
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:16,092
You never knew what
being married means...

416
00:28:16,342 --> 00:28:21,097
...like stability and supportiveness
and a house and neat stuff like that!

417
00:28:21,347 --> 00:28:22,098
I'll drive.

418
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:24,851
Then would you?

419
00:28:27,353 --> 00:28:30,815
Goddamn.

420
00:28:32,317 --> 00:28:35,069
Someone should warn
her about your temper.

421
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,071
She obviously has no idea.

422
00:28:37,322 --> 00:28:40,074
Stay out of it. I know what I'm doing.

423
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:41,075
What are you doing?

424
00:28:41,326 --> 00:28:44,078
They're getting better at this.

425
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:46,080
You know what? If you're happy...

426
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:48,082
Thank you.

427
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:51,085
I am happy. I'm a happy person.

428
00:28:51,336 --> 00:28:55,089
I'm happy with the way
things are going in my life.

429
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,092
- I'm happy with-with-with-
- Melissa?

430
00:28:58,343 --> 00:29:00,094
I know her name! Yes, with Melissa.

431
00:29:00,345 --> 00:29:02,096
You look happy.

432
00:29:02,347 --> 00:29:03,097
I am!

433
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:07,852
Shit. Shit!

434
00:29:08,353 --> 00:29:12,106
You going to wrap this up soon?

435
00:29:12,357 --> 00:29:13,107
What?

436
00:29:13,358 --> 00:29:17,111
Are we going to chase this tornado or
do you want to catch the next one?

437
00:29:17,362 --> 00:29:20,114
Shit!

438
00:29:20,365 --> 00:29:23,117
- Is it on the ground?
- I got it.

439
00:29:23,368 --> 00:29:26,871
Easy.

440
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,093
Bear right. It's on an easterly course.

441
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:45,098
The Weather Service has issued
a tornado warning till 11 a. m.

442
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:47,100
Dr. Miller?

443
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,102
I think they turned left.

444
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:52,855
Do it.

445
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,112
We'll intercept. Get ready to set up.

446
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:03,866
You got it.

447
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:13,126
- Get further ahead of it.
- I know what I'm doing.

448
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:14,127
Cut across.

449
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:16,087
- Get into that field.
- I'll get ahead of it.

450
00:30:16,337 --> 00:30:18,089
Want to drive?

451
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:21,092
- Would you like to drive?
- I'd love to.

452
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:26,889
Distances are about 3 miles south-east.
Let's see what she does.

453
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,101
Go in there.

454
00:30:30,351 --> 00:30:32,103
You'll miss it.

455
00:30:32,353 --> 00:30:34,105
Hold on a second.

456
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:37,859
Lost your nerve?

457
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:41,863
Tighten your seat belt.

458
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:50,872
Where are you? We lost visual.

459
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:57,128
Having fun?

460
00:30:57,378 --> 00:30:58,129
We must get out of this.

461
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:01,883
Really?

462
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:05,094
2 miles. Picking up speed.

463
00:31:05,344 --> 00:31:07,096
Sometime this week would be good.

464
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:10,850
I'm trying.

465
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,101
You mad?

466
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:15,104
I will be later. Now I'm
trying not to kill us.

467
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:21,861
Funnel's getting thicker!
It's moving fast! Coming towards you!

468
00:31:25,364 --> 00:31:26,115
It's turning!

469
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:28,117
- I can't see it.
- You will!

470
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:31,120
You're too close! It won't work!
Get out!

471
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:35,124
Oh, shit!

472
00:31:35,374 --> 00:31:38,127
It's too steep.

473
00:31:38,377 --> 00:31:42,882
This was a great idea!

474
00:31:53,392 --> 00:31:56,145
That wasn't so bad. Let's go!

475
00:31:56,395 --> 00:32:00,858
Why can't we spend a
normal day together?

476
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,155
We're in the damage path!
This is crazy! Forget it!

477
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:09,116
- No, it's going to hit us!
- We can still do this!

478
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:14,872
There's no time! Come on! Come on!

479
00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:18,125
Grab hold of something!

480
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:21,879
I know!

481
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:33,140
What are you doing?!

482
00:32:33,391 --> 00:32:34,141
I want to see it!

483
00:32:34,392 --> 00:32:36,143
Come back!

484
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:39,897
Come on!

485
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,870
Look out!

486
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:27,903
Oh, God.

487
00:33:29,405 --> 00:33:33,159
Oh, my God!

488
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:35,161
It's gone.

489
00:33:35,411 --> 00:33:38,164
It's gone.

490
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:41,876
Where's my truck?

491
00:33:45,421 --> 00:33:48,174
There it is.

492
00:33:48,424 --> 00:33:50,176
Oh, God!

493
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:53,929
Are you okay?

494
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,182
Are you okay?

495
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,142
You just missed that truck!

496
00:33:58,392 --> 00:33:59,143
Awesome!

497
00:33:59,393 --> 00:34:02,146
That's awesome!

498
00:34:02,396 --> 00:34:04,148
Oh, God, Billy!

499
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:06,150
Are you okay?

500
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,152
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

501
00:34:08,402 --> 00:34:10,154
She just missed the truck.

502
00:34:10,404 --> 00:34:12,156
What happened to you?

503
00:34:12,406 --> 00:34:16,160
Nothing, we're okay. We were safe.

504
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,162
It's trashed.

505
00:34:18,412 --> 00:34:19,163
Hang on.

506
00:34:19,413 --> 00:34:24,168
It's over. It's over. It's all over.

507
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:27,171
Are you okay?

508
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:31,884
She's okay.

509
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:38,182
There is some good news.

510
00:34:38,432 --> 00:34:41,936
It did fly.

511
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:45,147
What was it like?

512
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:47,149
It was windy.

513
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:48,150
Windy.

514
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,152
That's intense.

515
00:34:50,402 --> 00:34:52,154
Move it.

516
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:53,155
That's intense.

517
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:57,159
The Auto Club's here.

518
00:34:57,409 --> 00:35:02,164
Maybe we should stop,
see if they need help.

519
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:04,166
They're fine.
Pay attention to the road.

520
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:08,170
You're fashionably late again.

521
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,172
Give me a kiss.

522
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:14,176
Get out of here! Get out of here!

523
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:16,178
Loser!

524
00:35:16,428 --> 00:35:17,179
Find your own twister!

525
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:19,181
Losers!

526
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:22,184
Move on!

527
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:25,187
Tough luck, you guys!

528
00:35:25,437 --> 00:35:27,189
Let's go.

529
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:30,192
I'll get them clean.
Let's get Dorothy 2 ready.

530
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:33,153
You got full coverage on that truck?

531
00:35:33,404 --> 00:35:36,156
Liability only.

532
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:40,911
Liability only.

533
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:44,164
It's a pretty truck.

534
00:35:44,415 --> 00:35:48,919
Thank you.

535
00:35:50,421 --> 00:35:54,174
Don't even think about it.

536
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:58,929
No way.

537
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:06,937
This is the caboose! This is the
caboose! I'm waiting for orders.

538
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:09,189
Go ahead.

539
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,192
- It's your truck.
- No, you should.

540
00:36:12,443 --> 00:36:15,195
The battle zone should
be north-east of 81.

541
00:36:15,446 --> 00:36:17,197
The battle zone?

542
00:36:17,448 --> 00:36:18,198
What're we doing?

543
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:20,200
We're going again.

544
00:36:20,451 --> 00:36:23,203
But back there you almost got killed!

545
00:36:23,454 --> 00:36:25,205
Just a close call.

546
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:29,168
You're going to cross 15
at Oklahoma 412. 412.

547
00:36:29,418 --> 00:36:32,171
Copy that. Haynes,
what's on the Mesonet?

548
00:36:32,421 --> 00:36:36,925
Winds are continuing to back.

549
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:41,930
Okay, guys, lets go get it.

550
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:28,185
Mobile lab.

551
00:37:28,435 --> 00:37:31,188
Is it me, or is the
main updraft shifting?

552
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:34,191
Upper-level winds are veering.

553
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:37,194
It might dissipate. Do we have
time to get in front of it?

554
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:42,199
Rotation is increasing. Shear is
90 knots. 50 outbound, 40 inbound.

555
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:45,202
We see a very pronounced hook.

556
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:47,204
Checking for you now.

557
00:37:47,454 --> 00:37:50,207
We're getting south-east
gusts at 40 miles per hour.

558
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:52,209
Approaching 150 in the funnel.

559
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:56,213
Storm motion is 225 degrees
out of the south-west.

560
00:37:56,463 --> 00:38:00,968
We're in position. Proceed.

561
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:14,189
Howdy!

562
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:18,944
Must admire their spirit.

563
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:25,951
There's your pal.

564
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:33,959
What're you doing?

565
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:39,214
Look at the updraft.

566
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:40,215
The angle.

567
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:42,217
It's going to shift course.

568
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,219
You sure?

569
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:46,221
It's definitely a sidewinder.

570
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:47,222
It'll move left.

571
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:49,224
- Is that bad?
- Was there a road?

572
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:52,978
You're right! Go!

573
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:17,210
Donald, now's not a good time.

574
00:39:17,461 --> 00:39:21,965
All right, put Julia on, Donny.

575
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:26,219
Looking very good.

576
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:32,976
About a 4 miles up, hang a right,
let's deploy and we'll be done.

577
00:39:34,478 --> 00:39:36,229
Shit!

578
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,232
Shit, it's moving away!

579
00:39:39,483 --> 00:39:43,987
Looks like they'll intercept.

580
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:52,996
You told me this thing was going
to stay on the same heading!

581
00:39:53,497 --> 00:39:55,248
We're close.

582
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:57,250
I know.

583
00:39:57,501 --> 00:39:59,211
Where does this road take us?

584
00:39:59,461 --> 00:40:02,214
It feels unnatural, but
with Donald's motility...

585
00:40:02,464 --> 00:40:07,219
...you won't have a baby the usual
way, even standing on your head.

586
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:10,222
She's a reproductive therapist.

587
00:40:10,472 --> 00:40:12,224
Laurence- Damn.

588
00:40:12,474 --> 00:40:16,228
We must get ahead of this storm.

589
00:40:16,478 --> 00:40:17,229
Be right with you.

590
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:20,232
I can't talk now. I'll call you back.

591
00:40:20,482 --> 00:40:23,235
South. Shifting due south, copy.

592
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:27,239
We have an F-2, ladies and
gentlemen. Possibly F-3.

593
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:33,245
Read me? There's very, very large
rope on the ground. Very large.

594
00:40:33,495 --> 00:40:37,249
It looks like it's turning.
The atmosphere is unstable.

595
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:38,250
Repeat, unstable!

596
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,251
This is Rabbit!

597
00:40:39,501 --> 00:40:42,254
It's heading this way!

598
00:40:42,504 --> 00:40:43,255
This is Sanders.

599
00:40:43,505 --> 00:40:47,259
We are driving due east on a
road we've been on for 6 miles.

600
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:52,222
We've got an F-3 sitting here
on the ground. A beauty!

601
00:40:52,472 --> 00:40:54,224
Jo, it's Barn Burner!

602
00:40:54,474 --> 00:40:56,226
It won't hang out long!

603
00:40:56,476 --> 00:40:57,227
It's not hanging out.

604
00:40:57,477 --> 00:41:01,982
We got it! We see it!

605
00:41:06,486 --> 00:41:11,992
We're getting slammed in here.
You better hang back.

606
00:41:25,505 --> 00:41:30,010
- Is this thing loaded?
- Yeah, go for it.

607
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,261
Rain bands.

608
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:32,262
Look at the surf.

609
00:41:32,512 --> 00:41:37,017
Shit, horizontal rain! Hang on!

610
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:44,232
Jesus, I've never seen
clutter like this.

611
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:46,234
I don't think anyone has.

612
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:50,989
Flash frequencies are high.

613
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:56,995
We're in the core.

614
00:42:01,499 --> 00:42:02,250
We got sisters!

615
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,004
Oh, my God.

616
00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:08,256
Julia, I can't talk now.

617
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:11,259
- We're under the flanking line.
- I realise that.

618
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:14,262
We can't attack from the south.
We'll get rolled.

619
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:17,265
Watch me.

620
00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:25,023
I know you're upset. You just must
breathe. We both got to breathe.

621
00:42:28,485 --> 00:42:29,235
Cow.

622
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:34,991
I must go, Julia! We got cows!

623
00:42:37,494 --> 00:42:39,245
Another cow!

624
00:42:39,496 --> 00:42:42,999
I think it was the same one.

625
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,251
We got drunkards. We got no path!

626
00:42:45,502 --> 00:42:46,252
Get us out of here!

627
00:42:46,503 --> 00:42:51,007
- I'm trying!
- Floor it!

628
00:42:55,512 --> 00:42:59,015
Look out!

629
00:43:09,526 --> 00:43:14,030
Oh, God! Oh, God!

630
00:43:40,515 --> 00:43:43,268
See that carousel? Did you see?

631
00:43:43,518 --> 00:43:48,022
It was incredible.

632
00:43:53,528 --> 00:43:58,032
Oh, honey-honey-

633
00:44:02,537 --> 00:44:03,288
Did you see that?

634
00:44:03,538 --> 00:44:07,292
It's all right. Come on, it's okay.

635
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:13,047
No, I'm not okay. This is not okay.

636
00:44:14,549 --> 00:44:17,260
Oh, Christ, I'm sorry.

637
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,262
Honey, I didn't think.

638
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:23,266
When you used to tell me
that you chased tornados...

639
00:44:23,516 --> 00:44:28,271
...deep down I always
thought it was a metaphor.

640
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:30,273
It's okay. It's okay.

641
00:44:30,523 --> 00:44:34,277
Three times a lady!
Did you see the inflow jets?

642
00:44:34,527 --> 00:44:37,280
See?! I was in the middle of it!

643
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:41,284
I'm thinking it might not
be too bad of an idea...

644
00:44:41,534 --> 00:44:44,287
...if we left, because there
was too many tornados there.

645
00:44:44,537 --> 00:44:49,292
Are you kidding? This thing's not over.
We've only seen the start.

646
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:50,293
You know...

647
00:44:50,543 --> 00:44:53,296
...we're close to Wakita.

648
00:44:53,546 --> 00:44:56,299
Aunt Meg wouldn't mind a pit stop.

649
00:44:56,549 --> 00:44:58,301
We crave sustenance.

650
00:44:58,551 --> 00:45:02,305
Guys, we are not invading my aunt.

651
00:45:02,555 --> 00:45:03,306
Food.

652
00:45:03,556 --> 00:45:06,267
Food.

653
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:12,023
We're absolutely not going.

654
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:23,284
There's the spot. Just do it.

655
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:27,038
Great.

656
00:45:37,548 --> 00:45:41,302
Come on, honey.

657
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:42,303
Come on.

658
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:46,307
You must meet her, she's great.
Meg, how are you?

659
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:49,310
- How are you?
- It is so good to see you!

660
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,311
You too.

661
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:52,313
The other day I told Jo...

662
00:45:52,563 --> 00:45:54,315
...how much I miss you.

663
00:45:54,565 --> 00:45:57,276
You haven't seen my new work.

664
00:45:57,527 --> 00:45:59,278
Oh, honey.

665
00:45:59,529 --> 00:46:01,280
You've seen some action.

666
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:03,282
You should've seen it.

667
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:04,325
Boys!

668
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:08,079
Give me some loving!

669
00:46:14,544 --> 00:46:18,297
In a lightning storm, grab your
ankles and stick your butt up.

670
00:46:18,548 --> 00:46:21,300
It's the safest orifice to get hit.

671
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:23,302
I'd like to get hit, see what it's like.

672
00:46:23,553 --> 00:46:26,305
Real lemonade. Meg, I'm moving in!

673
00:46:26,556 --> 00:46:31,060
Look out. Make a space.

674
00:46:38,568 --> 00:46:42,071
Look out.

675
00:46:43,573 --> 00:46:45,324
God, you got a lot of beef.

676
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:48,327
- Where'd you get this beef?
- Did you see my cows?

677
00:46:48,578 --> 00:46:52,081
No.

678
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:54,333
Cool.

679
00:46:54,584 --> 00:46:55,334
You slaughter them.

680
00:46:55,543 --> 00:46:58,296
Nice. Potatoes.

681
00:46:58,546 --> 00:47:00,298
Grab it now.

682
00:47:00,548 --> 00:47:07,054
Meg's gravy is famous.
It's practically a food group.

683
00:47:07,555 --> 00:47:09,307
Shower's free.

684
00:47:09,557 --> 00:47:13,060
I'm next.

685
00:47:14,562 --> 00:47:17,315
I want that.

686
00:47:17,565 --> 00:47:20,318
How can you watch this garbage?

687
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:24,322
Pardon me. You must see this.

688
00:47:24,572 --> 00:47:27,325
Like for you to be out
there chasing tornados?

689
00:47:27,575 --> 00:47:29,327
It's a thrill.

690
00:47:29,577 --> 00:47:32,330
Man vs. nature. Battling the elements.

691
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,332
What a weasel.

692
00:47:34,582 --> 00:47:38,336
As a scientist, can you
actually predict tornados now?

693
00:47:38,586 --> 00:47:40,338
No, they're unpredictable...

694
00:47:40,588 --> 00:47:43,341
...as my unfortunate
colleagues found out today.

695
00:47:43,591 --> 00:47:47,345
But we hope to change all that
with a system I have devised.

696
00:47:47,595 --> 00:47:49,347
God, he sucks.

697
00:47:49,597 --> 00:47:50,348
Shut up!

698
00:47:50,598 --> 00:47:52,350
Turn him off.

699
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,351
What a wiener.

700
00:47:53,601 --> 00:47:57,313
He's so in love with himself.
I thought it was a summer thing.

701
00:47:57,563 --> 00:47:59,315
He'll rue the day.

702
00:47:59,565 --> 00:48:02,318
He'll rue the day he came
up against The Extreme.

703
00:48:02,568 --> 00:48:04,320
- Hear, hear.
- Amen, baby.

704
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:07,323
Bill, I'm talking imminent rue-age.

705
00:48:07,573 --> 00:48:10,326
Imminent rue-age.

706
00:48:10,576 --> 00:48:14,330
I was just wondering, why do
you call Billy "The Extreme"?

707
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:17,333
'Cause Billy is The Extreme.

708
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:21,337
Bill's the most out-of-controllest
bastard in the game.

709
00:48:21,587 --> 00:48:25,341
No, I think I came in second.

710
00:48:25,591 --> 00:48:26,342
I've seen him in high gear.

711
00:48:26,592 --> 00:48:29,345
You guys must get new stories.

712
00:48:29,595 --> 00:48:30,346
I'll go clean up.

713
00:48:30,596 --> 00:48:32,306
So...

714
00:48:32,556 --> 00:48:34,308
...we get this one near Daleton.

715
00:48:34,558 --> 00:48:35,309
God!

716
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:38,354
We're close and Jo's got the VID on it.

717
00:48:38,604 --> 00:48:40,356
She's filming it.

718
00:48:40,606 --> 00:48:45,361
Suddenly, this shitty-looking green
Valiant pulls up right in the way.

719
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:47,363
She starts yelling and this...

720
00:48:47,571 --> 00:48:52,326
...loser stumbles out of the car.
He's got a bottle of Jack Daniels.

721
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:53,327
He's naked.

722
00:48:53,577 --> 00:48:55,329
He's butt-naked.

723
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:57,331
Not naked.

724
00:48:57,581 --> 00:49:00,334
I was not naked!

725
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:02,336
He's without apparel.

726
00:49:02,586 --> 00:49:03,337
Half-naked.

727
00:49:03,587 --> 00:49:09,343
Naked. So, Jo's yelling at him
to get out of the way, right?

728
00:49:09,593 --> 00:49:11,345
So...

729
00:49:11,595 --> 00:49:14,348
...he just strolls up to the twister...

730
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:16,350
...and says, "Have a drink!"

731
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,353
And he chucks the bottle
into the twister and...

732
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:21,355
...it never hits the ground.

733
00:49:21,605 --> 00:49:24,358
Twister caught it, sucked it right up.

734
00:49:24,608 --> 00:49:27,361
Honey, this is a tissue of lies.

735
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:29,363
There was another Bill...

736
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:30,364
...an evil Bill...

737
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:32,366
...and I killed him.

738
00:49:32,616 --> 00:49:36,078
I love him!

739
00:49:46,589 --> 00:49:49,341
That was a good-size twister.
What was that? An F-3?

740
00:49:49,592 --> 00:49:50,342
F-2.

741
00:49:50,593 --> 00:49:52,344
I'm lost again.

742
00:49:52,595 --> 00:49:56,348
It's the Fujita scale. It measures a
tornado's intensity by how much it eats.

743
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:57,349
Eats?

744
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,351
Destroys.

745
00:49:59,602 --> 00:50:02,354
That encounter we had was
a strong F-2, F-3, maybe.

746
00:50:02,605 --> 00:50:05,357
We'll see F-4's today.

747
00:50:05,608 --> 00:50:06,358
That'd be sweet.

748
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:11,363
Four is good. Four would
relocate your house efficiently.

749
00:50:11,614 --> 00:50:16,118
Is there an F-5?

750
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:19,371
What would that be like?

751
00:50:19,622 --> 00:50:24,126
The finger of God.

752
00:50:25,628 --> 00:50:30,090
None of you has seen an F-5?

753
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:34,094
Just one of us.

754
00:50:43,604 --> 00:50:45,356
Forget it.

755
00:50:45,606 --> 00:50:47,358
Doesn't matter what you do...

756
00:50:47,608 --> 00:50:49,360
...you'll still be beautiful.

757
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,362
You're biased.

758
00:50:51,612 --> 00:50:54,365
Yes, I am.

759
00:50:54,615 --> 00:50:56,367
Sounds like old times.

760
00:50:56,617 --> 00:51:00,120
Yes, it does.

761
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:03,374
He didn't keep his part of the bargain.

762
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:05,376
Which part?

763
00:51:05,626 --> 00:51:10,381
To spend his life pining for you
and die miserable and alone.

764
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:15,135
That so much to ask?

765
00:51:17,638 --> 00:51:20,391
I don't know.

766
00:51:20,641 --> 00:51:26,355
Bill always went his own way,
usually the same way you were going.

767
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:30,359
Seems like a long time ago.

768
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:34,113
Not so long, Jo.

769
00:51:34,613 --> 00:51:39,118
He's here, isn't he?

770
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:45,124
That is so beautiful.

771
00:51:45,624 --> 00:51:48,377
We got one!

772
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:51,380
F-3, mile outside of Parlaine!

773
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:56,385
This is for Garfield county,
including the city of Enid.

774
00:51:56,635 --> 00:51:59,388
This storm has developed
in the last 15 minutes.

775
00:51:59,638 --> 00:52:04,393
Doppler radar shows that
this is an intense storm.

776
00:52:04,643 --> 00:52:05,394
Ride with Dusty, okay?

777
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:07,396
- What's SELS say?
- Big!

778
00:52:07,646 --> 00:52:08,397
Let's go!

779
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:10,399
Where's Jonas?

780
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:12,401
- He's in Milston.
-30 miles away.

781
00:52:12,651 --> 00:52:14,361
- Can we beat him?
- I'm working on it.

782
00:52:14,611 --> 00:52:15,362
Thanks for stopping by.

783
00:52:15,612 --> 00:52:17,364
Sorry to eat and run.

784
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:20,367
It's what you live for.

785
00:52:20,617 --> 00:52:21,368
Good to see you.

786
00:52:21,618 --> 00:52:23,370
It's okay.

787
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,372
Tasty cow, Aunt Meg.

788
00:52:25,622 --> 00:52:26,373
It's for you.

789
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:27,374
Thank you.

790
00:52:27,624 --> 00:52:29,376
You and me, right?

791
00:52:29,626 --> 00:52:30,377
Sweet.

792
00:52:30,627 --> 00:52:32,379
Sweet.

793
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:33,380
Nice meeting you.

794
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:38,135
Likewise. You better run.

795
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:40,387
Keys.

796
00:52:40,637 --> 00:52:44,391
Please. You're welcome.

797
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:48,145
Hang on.

798
00:52:48,645 --> 00:52:49,396
We'll go through town.

799
00:52:49,646 --> 00:52:54,401
We'll take Meyers Road past the fire
station, then 132 to the 44 east.

800
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:59,156
If there's shortcuts, let us know.

801
00:53:30,646 --> 00:53:34,399
Rabbit, time to impress me.

802
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:41,156
A mile up there's a little detour.
We'll walk in the woods.

803
00:53:56,672 --> 00:54:00,384
It gets bumpy here, folks.

804
00:54:00,634 --> 00:54:04,137
Let's get you wired.

805
00:54:09,643 --> 00:54:14,147
Excuse me.

806
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:21,154
Okay, you're on.

807
00:54:25,659 --> 00:54:28,412
An ordinary person spends his life...

808
00:54:28,662 --> 00:54:30,414
...avoiding tense situations.

809
00:54:30,664 --> 00:54:32,416
Repo Man spends his life...

810
00:54:32,666 --> 00:54:38,171
...getting into tense
situations, Beltzer!

811
00:54:42,676 --> 00:54:44,428
What do you got?

812
00:54:44,678 --> 00:54:47,431
Turn left here toward that farm.

813
00:54:47,681 --> 00:54:50,434
You sure?

814
00:54:50,684 --> 00:54:54,396
Trust me. Rabbit is good.
Rabbit is wise.

815
00:54:54,646 --> 00:54:56,398
- Mother of God.
- Jesus Christ.

816
00:54:56,648 --> 00:54:58,400
This is a field.

817
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:01,403
I know. Keep going beyond it,
through that brush.

818
00:55:01,653 --> 00:55:04,406
See that brush right in front of you?

819
00:55:04,656 --> 00:55:06,408
Yes, we see it. What's beyond that?

820
00:55:06,658 --> 00:55:07,409
Beyond what?

821
00:55:07,659 --> 00:55:08,410
Beyond what?

822
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:13,415
The brush! A brick wall,
a bearded lady, what?

823
00:55:13,665 --> 00:55:18,170
It's the highway!

824
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:19,421
Where's the road?

825
00:55:19,671 --> 00:55:21,423
Where's the road?

826
00:55:21,673 --> 00:55:25,177
It should be any moment.

827
00:55:31,683 --> 00:55:33,435
Hello.

828
00:55:33,685 --> 00:55:34,436
Shit.

829
00:55:34,686 --> 00:55:36,438
She's insane.

830
00:55:36,688 --> 00:55:39,441
You're insane.
You trying to kill someone?

831
00:55:39,691 --> 00:55:40,442
Really?

832
00:55:40,692 --> 00:55:44,404
It was nice of you to see 10
people on the road and not stop!

833
00:55:44,654 --> 00:55:48,408
Very good. Let's keep
this channel clear.

834
00:55:48,658 --> 00:55:53,163
Dirt bag.

835
00:56:00,086 --> 00:56:02,839
We have to get off this road.

836
00:56:03,089 --> 00:56:03,840
Don't guess.

837
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:06,843
I'm not. Make a right turn.

838
00:56:07,093 --> 00:56:07,844
Want to drive?

839
00:56:08,094 --> 00:56:11,598
Just turn!

840
00:56:16,102 --> 00:56:19,606
Do we follow?

841
00:56:21,107 --> 00:56:24,611
We do not.

842
00:56:28,073 --> 00:56:30,825
What's he doing?

843
00:56:31,076 --> 00:56:32,827
I don't know.

844
00:56:33,078 --> 00:56:39,584
Find this road. It's like Bob's road.

845
00:56:41,086 --> 00:56:42,837
Touchdown!

846
00:56:43,088 --> 00:56:44,839
We have touchdown.
Tornado is on the ground.

847
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:46,841
Listen to this.

848
00:56:47,092 --> 00:56:48,843
It's coming down Route 33.

849
00:56:49,094 --> 00:56:50,845
We're on 33.

850
00:56:51,096 --> 00:56:52,847
What's the path?

851
00:56:53,098 --> 00:56:55,850
It's going about 35 miles an hour.

852
00:56:56,101 --> 00:56:57,811
- Do you see this?
- I can't.

853
00:56:58,061 --> 00:56:59,813
Where is it? Hello.

854
00:57:00,063 --> 00:57:01,815
Where're you looking?

855
00:57:02,065 --> 00:57:03,817
- Where?
- Direction, Rabbit.

856
00:57:04,067 --> 00:57:04,818
North-northeast.

857
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:05,819
See it?

858
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:07,821
Got anything?

859
00:57:08,071 --> 00:57:08,822
North-northeast, do you copy?

860
00:57:09,072 --> 00:57:10,824
It's coming right at us.

861
00:57:11,074 --> 00:57:14,828
Axis's gone vertical.
Sucker's really gaining strength.

862
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:16,830
Do you see it?

863
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,833
No.

864
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:24,838
We don't have a visual! Repeat!
We don't have a visual! Help us out!

865
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:25,839
Where is it?

866
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:28,842
I got it. It's the best
motion I've ever seen.

867
00:57:29,092 --> 00:57:33,596
The base of this fatty's over 1/2 mile.

868
00:57:34,097 --> 00:57:38,852
If you're going east on 7, it's coming
over the hill in a few minutes.

869
00:57:39,102 --> 00:57:40,854
This is the one. I feel it.

870
00:57:41,104 --> 00:57:42,856
It must be there.

871
00:57:43,106 --> 00:57:45,859
Maybe it stalled.

872
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:47,861
No, I think Rabbit's right.

873
00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:51,865
It's going to show its ugly
face right over that hill.

874
00:57:52,115 --> 00:57:53,867
What do you think?

875
00:57:54,117 --> 00:57:58,580
You going for it?

876
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:02,834
Time for deployment.

877
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:09,591
Oh, man. This is the
fun part, sweetheart.

878
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:19,851
We got hail.

879
00:58:20,101 --> 00:58:24,606
Hail. We got hail.

880
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:28,860
Pull over.

881
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,820
That's good.

882
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:34,574
We got a big one!

883
00:58:36,075 --> 00:58:37,827
Upflow, Beltzer! We have upflow.
Copy.

884
00:58:38,077 --> 00:58:40,830
I'm checking it.

885
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,834
I'm checking. She's almost up.

886
00:58:45,084 --> 00:58:46,836
Now, this is it.

887
00:58:47,086 --> 00:58:51,591
I'll get her ready.

888
00:58:59,098 --> 00:59:00,850
You see them?

889
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:01,851
You see them?

890
00:59:02,101 --> 00:59:03,853
The red truck went toward the core!

891
00:59:04,103 --> 00:59:08,608
Is he talking about Billy?

892
00:59:09,108 --> 00:59:10,860
Are you okay?!

893
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:14,614
Yes! Keep going!

894
00:59:25,124 --> 00:59:26,834
Beltzer, we got a view!

895
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:28,836
I see it!

896
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:30,838
Okay, I got it!

897
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:36,594
That's no moon! It's a space station!

898
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:42,600
We have debris!

899
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,833
They're in the bear cage!

900
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:08,835
Oh, my God!

901
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:09,836
Oh, my God!

902
01:00:10,086 --> 01:00:11,838
Look at this!

903
01:00:12,088 --> 01:00:13,840
Take a peek!

904
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:16,843
You can really feel it
with a telephoto lens!

905
01:00:17,093 --> 01:00:18,845
What's wrong?

906
01:00:19,095 --> 01:00:19,846
What's wrong?

907
01:00:20,096 --> 01:00:22,849
You people are crazy, do you know that?

908
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:25,852
Are you set up? We're not
leaving till we get this.

909
01:00:26,102 --> 01:00:30,606
And she's the craziest one of them all!

910
01:00:41,117 --> 01:00:43,870
Okay, she's almost ready!

911
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:44,871
Hold on!

912
01:00:45,121 --> 01:00:50,626
We're almost there! We're almost there!

913
01:00:55,131 --> 01:00:56,883
This is fine!

914
01:00:57,133 --> 01:00:57,884
No, a little closer!

915
01:00:58,134 --> 01:01:01,596
A little closer!

916
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:06,601
Close enough.

917
01:01:11,105 --> 01:01:14,859
Hurry! Get the tailgate!

918
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:16,861
You got it?

919
01:01:17,111 --> 01:01:19,864
She's set. Help me get her down.

920
01:01:20,114 --> 01:01:20,865
Hurry!

921
01:01:21,115 --> 01:01:25,620
Let's go!

922
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:28,873
Hurry!

923
01:01:29,123 --> 01:01:30,875
Damn! We got to go!

924
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:32,877
We can do it!

925
01:01:33,127 --> 01:01:36,631
- Come on!
- It's stuck.

926
01:01:54,106 --> 01:01:54,857
Look out!

927
01:01:55,107 --> 01:01:58,611
Come on! Hurry!

928
01:02:09,121 --> 01:02:10,873
Where'd it go?

929
01:02:11,123 --> 01:02:12,875
Where is it?

930
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:14,877
What's going on?

931
01:02:15,127 --> 01:02:17,880
I don't believe this.

932
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:18,881
What the hell!

933
01:02:19,131 --> 01:02:23,636
What's the Doppler say?

934
01:02:24,136 --> 01:02:28,641
The cone of silence.

935
01:02:36,107 --> 01:02:37,858
Bill, Jo, it's over.

936
01:02:38,109 --> 01:02:40,861
The thing was stable and then it...

937
01:02:41,112 --> 01:02:42,863
It's gone.

938
01:02:43,114 --> 01:02:46,867
- It's backbuilding!
- It's not through yet.

939
01:02:47,118 --> 01:02:49,870
You're right. It's backbuilding.

940
01:02:50,121 --> 01:02:51,872
We got a jumper!

941
01:02:52,123 --> 01:02:53,874
It's backbuilding! Track it!

942
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:56,877
Yeah, Jo! Data's incomplete!

943
01:02:57,128 --> 01:03:00,881
You guys should get out!

944
01:03:01,132 --> 01:03:02,883
Bill, help! Help me!

945
01:03:03,134 --> 01:03:04,885
We should leave.

946
01:03:05,136 --> 01:03:06,887
- Forget the sensors!
- Help me!

947
01:03:07,138 --> 01:03:08,889
We must get out of here now!

948
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,891
Beltzer'll see if it drops!

949
01:03:11,142 --> 01:03:16,856
It's not going to drop anywhere
near us! It'll drop on us!

950
01:03:17,106 --> 01:03:19,859
We can still do this! Wait!

951
01:03:20,109 --> 01:03:21,861
Go back!

952
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,863
Forget it! Forget it!

953
01:03:24,113 --> 01:03:29,618
Go back! It's not too late!

954
01:03:32,121 --> 01:03:34,874
- Go back!
- Forget it! It's too late!

955
01:03:35,124 --> 01:03:36,876
Help me!

956
01:03:37,126 --> 01:03:38,878
Help me!

957
01:03:39,128 --> 01:03:40,880
What're you doing?

958
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,882
The pack's wasted! It's over!

959
01:03:43,132 --> 01:03:45,885
What's wrong? We can still do this!

960
01:03:46,135 --> 01:03:47,887
Listen to you! You're obsessed!

961
01:03:48,137 --> 01:03:49,889
You've never seen what it can do!

962
01:03:50,139 --> 01:03:52,892
- I just saw it!
- You've never seen it!

963
01:03:53,142 --> 01:03:58,898
You've never seen it miss this house,
miss that house and come after you.

964
01:03:59,148 --> 01:04:03,903
Christ, Jo, is that
what you think it did?

965
01:04:04,153 --> 01:04:05,905
You don't know.

966
01:04:06,155 --> 01:04:07,907
Why can't you forget it?!

967
01:04:08,157 --> 01:04:10,910
You don't understand.
You'll never know.

968
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,870
When's it going to be enough?

969
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:17,875
How close do you have to get?!
Talk to me! Jo, things go wrong!

970
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:21,879
You can't explain it!
You can't predict it!

971
01:04:22,129 --> 01:04:25,883
Killing yourself won't
bring your dad back.

972
01:04:26,133 --> 01:04:28,886
I'm sorry he died.
But it was a long time ago.

973
01:04:29,136 --> 01:04:31,889
You've got to move on.

974
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:35,893
Stop living in the past and look
at what's right in front of you.

975
01:04:36,143 --> 01:04:37,895
What're you saying?

976
01:04:38,145 --> 01:04:41,649
Me, Jo.

977
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:29,655
You better come here and look at this.

978
01:05:30,155 --> 01:05:33,909
Velocities are maxed out.
Those two cells converge...

979
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:39,665
Inbounds and outbounds have doubled.

980
01:07:03,165 --> 01:07:05,918
There have been tornado sightings.

981
01:07:06,168 --> 01:07:10,923
The latest reported just to the
north-east of Canton a few minutes ago.

982
01:07:11,173 --> 01:07:14,927
Wait a second. I've just been handed
this-. This is official now.

983
01:07:15,177 --> 01:07:21,683
A tornado has been reported moving
through Canton a few minutes ago.

984
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:34,655
Can I have 8 coffees to go, please?

985
01:08:16,154 --> 01:08:18,657
Two coffees.

986
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:23,662
Long day.

987
01:08:27,165 --> 01:08:29,918
I've been thinking about the sensors.

988
01:08:30,168 --> 01:08:34,923
The way they scattered out
there today on the highway.

989
01:08:35,173 --> 01:08:36,925
I'm starting to wonder...

990
01:08:37,175 --> 01:08:40,929
...if the funnel'll carry them.

991
01:08:41,179 --> 01:08:42,931
Too light?

992
01:08:43,181 --> 01:08:45,934
I don't know. Maybe the
whole thing's too light.

993
01:08:46,184 --> 01:08:50,689
What can we do?

994
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:53,942
I'm not sure.

995
01:08:54,192 --> 01:08:56,903
This is a very dangerous situation.

996
01:08:57,154 --> 01:09:00,907
If you have loved ones in the
area do not try to help them.

997
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:05,662
You'll only be a hindrance to them.

998
01:09:06,163 --> 01:09:09,666
Thank you.

999
01:10:20,195 --> 01:10:25,659
Shit. Jesus, it's coming.

1000
01:10:28,161 --> 01:10:32,916
It's coming! It's headed right for us!

1001
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:34,918
It's already here.

1002
01:10:35,168 --> 01:10:38,672
Everybody, underground!

1003
01:10:44,177 --> 01:10:47,681
Honey!

1004
01:10:48,181 --> 01:10:51,685
Come on!

1005
01:11:13,164 --> 01:11:17,669
Jo, come on!

1006
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:19,921
Get underground!

1007
01:11:20,171 --> 01:11:24,676
Take cover, now!

1008
01:11:34,185 --> 01:11:35,937
Close the doors!

1009
01:11:36,187 --> 01:11:40,692
Doors! Doors!

1010
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:49,951
Come on!

1011
01:11:50,201 --> 01:11:51,953
Come back!

1012
01:11:52,203 --> 01:11:52,954
Take my hand!

1013
01:11:53,204 --> 01:11:55,915
Take my hand!

1014
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:59,919
Come on, hurry!

1015
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:04,924
Come on! Get in here! Get in here!

1016
01:12:05,175 --> 01:12:09,679
Go, go, go! Come on!

1017
01:12:12,182 --> 01:12:13,933
Everyone down in the pit!

1018
01:12:14,184 --> 01:12:14,934
Get down!

1019
01:12:15,185 --> 01:12:17,937
Everybody down!

1020
01:12:18,188 --> 01:12:22,692
Move!

1021
01:12:48,176 --> 01:12:51,679
Stay calm!

1022
01:13:08,196 --> 01:13:12,700
I got it.

1023
01:13:24,212 --> 01:13:24,963
It's okay!

1024
01:13:25,213 --> 01:13:26,923
My head.

1025
01:13:27,173 --> 01:13:28,925
You're okay.

1026
01:13:29,175 --> 01:13:31,928
- It's not okay!
- It'll be over soon!

1027
01:13:32,178 --> 01:13:33,930
This is insane!

1028
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,932
Stay calm!

1029
01:13:36,182 --> 01:13:41,688
This is driving me crazy!
I don't want to do this!

1030
01:14:12,177 --> 01:14:17,682
It's okay, honey.
It's going to be okay.

1031
01:14:29,193 --> 01:14:31,946
Chewed my lips off wondering
if he was coming back home.

1032
01:14:32,196 --> 01:14:34,949
I've never been so
frightened in my life.

1033
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:35,950
Was I on key?

1034
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:36,951
You were.

1035
01:14:37,201 --> 01:14:41,706
Wow, that's a wonder.

1036
01:15:24,207 --> 01:15:29,712
Look at the truck. It's trashed.

1037
01:15:39,222 --> 01:15:42,934
Of course, tornado activity continues.

1038
01:15:43,184 --> 01:15:46,938
Reports from Fairview indicate
a drive-in was blown away.

1039
01:15:47,188 --> 01:15:49,982
We know there's injuries
and the damage is massive.

1040
01:15:50,191 --> 01:15:52,944
Is that what it was like up on the hill?

1041
01:15:53,194 --> 01:15:54,946
That? No.

1042
01:15:55,196 --> 01:15:56,948
We were lucky.

1043
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:01,953
Those were just downdrafts
and microbursts.

1044
01:16:02,203 --> 01:16:05,957
The tornado just sideswiped us.

1045
01:16:06,207 --> 01:16:08,960
Which way is it headed?

1046
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:13,714
It's banking north-east.

1047
01:16:16,217 --> 01:16:20,721
It looks to hit Wakita.

1048
01:16:26,227 --> 01:16:28,980
I'm going. I'm going. Let's go.

1049
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:29,981
We're going!

1050
01:16:30,231 --> 01:16:31,983
Get me a route around the storm.

1051
01:16:32,191 --> 01:16:33,985
Light up! Let's go!

1052
01:16:34,235 --> 01:16:34,986
Wait!

1053
01:16:35,236 --> 01:16:35,945
Where's the phone?

1054
01:16:36,195 --> 01:16:38,948
- The lines are down.
- I'm going.

1055
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:40,950
Damn it.

1056
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:41,951
I'll drive.

1057
01:16:42,201 --> 01:16:46,956
We can jump on the 38 exchange
and cross Highway 132.

1058
01:16:47,206 --> 01:16:48,958
Honey, it's Meg. I got to go.

1059
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:50,960
I'm going back.

1060
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:52,962
Good. You'll be safe at the motel.

1061
01:16:53,212 --> 01:16:55,965
See you in the morning.

1062
01:16:56,215 --> 01:16:58,968
I won't be there.

1063
01:16:59,218 --> 01:17:00,970
What?

1064
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:02,972
Why?

1065
01:17:03,222 --> 01:17:04,974
What do you mean?

1066
01:17:05,224 --> 01:17:07,977
I'm saying good-bye.

1067
01:17:08,227 --> 01:17:11,981
You know what?
I can't compete with this.

1068
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:13,941
I don't know where to start.

1069
01:17:14,192 --> 01:17:15,985
Don't do this now.

1070
01:17:16,194 --> 01:17:21,741
Sooner or later it would have ended.
We both know that.

1071
01:17:22,241 --> 01:17:25,953
The funny thing is...

1072
01:17:26,204 --> 01:17:27,955
...I'm not that upset.

1073
01:17:28,206 --> 01:17:30,958
What does that mean?

1074
01:17:31,209 --> 01:17:35,713
We can do it! Come on! Let's move!

1075
01:17:37,215 --> 01:17:38,966
I didn't mean it to happen.

1076
01:17:39,217 --> 01:17:40,968
Billy, I know.

1077
01:17:41,218 --> 01:17:43,971
It's okay.

1078
01:17:44,221 --> 01:17:47,725
Come on.

1079
01:17:48,225 --> 01:17:49,977
You go ahead.

1080
01:17:50,227 --> 01:17:52,980
She needs you.

1081
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:55,983
I hope Aunt Meg's okay.

1082
01:17:56,192 --> 01:17:57,985
What about you?

1083
01:17:58,235 --> 01:17:59,987
Don't worry about me.

1084
01:18:00,237 --> 01:18:04,742
I know my way home.

1085
01:18:06,243 --> 01:18:08,996
We can be to Wakita in an hour.

1086
01:18:09,205 --> 01:18:12,708
Come on.

1087
01:18:25,221 --> 01:18:29,725
Oh, my God.

1088
01:18:37,233 --> 01:18:40,736
They had no warning.

1089
01:19:12,226 --> 01:19:15,730
Jo, wait!

1090
01:19:22,236 --> 01:19:25,739
Wait!

1091
01:19:30,244 --> 01:19:34,707
Careful, this house could go any second.

1092
01:19:40,254 --> 01:19:43,757
Take a flashlight.

1093
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:50,723
This whole place is ready to go.

1094
01:19:53,225 --> 01:19:57,730
Careful.

1095
01:20:02,234 --> 01:20:04,987
Did you hear that?

1096
01:20:05,237 --> 01:20:09,742
- I heard something.
- Easy.

1097
01:20:12,244 --> 01:20:15,748
Careful.

1098
01:20:27,218 --> 01:20:28,969
She's down here!

1099
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:34,725
Meg, we're here! We're coming down!

1100
01:20:37,228 --> 01:20:38,979
Get this off her.

1101
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:39,980
Hang on.

1102
01:20:40,231 --> 01:20:41,982
Don't move.

1103
01:20:42,233 --> 01:20:42,983
- Ready?
- Watch your head.

1104
01:20:43,234 --> 01:20:43,984
Go.

1105
01:20:44,235 --> 01:20:45,986
Go.

1106
01:20:46,237 --> 01:20:47,988
I got it.

1107
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:49,990
Easy. Are you okay?

1108
01:20:50,241 --> 01:20:54,745
No, I'm all right. I'm fine.

1109
01:20:55,246 --> 01:20:59,750
Oh, God.

1110
01:21:03,253 --> 01:21:04,004
Hurry.

1111
01:21:04,254 --> 01:21:08,759
- Let's go.
- Can you walk?

1112
01:21:09,259 --> 01:21:11,762
Watch out!

1113
01:21:22,231 --> 01:21:23,983
Joey, take my watch.

1114
01:21:24,233 --> 01:21:27,736
Go. Careful.

1115
01:21:28,237 --> 01:21:29,989
We're coming out!

1116
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:30,990
Get an ambulance!

1117
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,993
Get an ambulance! Move it! Now!
Go!

1118
01:21:34,243 --> 01:21:37,746
Give me the lamp.

1119
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:44,003
How about steak and eggs?

1120
01:21:44,253 --> 01:21:48,007
- How nice you all came over.
- There you go.

1121
01:21:48,257 --> 01:21:51,760
Nice and slow.

1122
01:22:00,227 --> 01:22:03,981
Easy, easy.

1123
01:22:04,231 --> 01:22:07,985
Grab Mose for me! I think
he's a little shaken up.

1124
01:22:08,235 --> 01:22:12,740
Don't worry, I'll get him!

1125
01:22:14,241 --> 01:22:15,993
Is she okay?

1126
01:22:16,243 --> 01:22:17,995
We'll probably keep her overnight.

1127
01:22:18,245 --> 01:22:18,996
Forget it.

1128
01:22:19,246 --> 01:22:21,999
- I'm all right.
- You're going to the hospital.

1129
01:22:22,249 --> 01:22:25,002
Okay, I'll go. But I'm
going to drive myself.

1130
01:22:25,252 --> 01:22:29,757
Your car's in a tree around the corner.

1131
01:22:31,258 --> 01:22:32,009
It's okay.

1132
01:22:32,259 --> 01:22:35,763
It's okay.

1133
01:22:46,273 --> 01:22:49,026
The F-4 that hit Wakita has
now moved to the Northeast.

1134
01:22:49,276 --> 01:22:54,031
I've just gotten word in that an even
stronger tornado has started to form...

1135
01:22:54,281 --> 01:22:58,994
...25 miles south where the two
storms met and combined forces.

1136
01:22:59,244 --> 01:23:01,997
Weather Service says this is unusual.

1137
01:23:02,247 --> 01:23:05,000
Oh, my God.

1138
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:09,004
Look at this. Here, look at this.

1139
01:23:09,254 --> 01:23:13,008
We're talking about winds in
excess of 300 miles an hour.

1140
01:23:13,258 --> 01:23:14,009
What're you doing?

1141
01:23:14,259 --> 01:23:17,012
I want to see how you are. How is she?

1142
01:23:17,262 --> 01:23:21,767
I was worried about you.

1143
01:23:22,267 --> 01:23:25,979
- Look at this.
- It's nothing.

1144
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:30,984
He says I have a bump on the
head and maybe a broken wrist.

1145
01:23:31,235 --> 01:23:31,985
Let me see that.

1146
01:23:32,236 --> 01:23:36,990
There's nothing to see.
It doesn't hurt.

1147
01:23:37,241 --> 01:23:39,993
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

1148
01:23:40,244 --> 01:23:44,998
Stop blaming yourself.
You got me out of the house.

1149
01:23:45,249 --> 01:23:47,000
It's got to stop.

1150
01:23:47,251 --> 01:23:49,002
I didn't have any warning.

1151
01:23:49,253 --> 01:23:56,760
The sirens went off a few seconds before
it hit. I didn't get downstairs.

1152
01:23:57,261 --> 01:24:00,013
I'm sorry.

1153
01:24:00,264 --> 01:24:03,016
I was listening to the
radio and... I mean...

1154
01:24:03,267 --> 01:24:05,018
You may not want to know,
but it's happening.

1155
01:24:05,269 --> 01:24:10,774
N.S.S.L's predicting an F-5.

1156
01:24:12,276 --> 01:24:15,028
It's going to happen to someone else.

1157
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:18,031
You go stop it.

1158
01:24:18,282 --> 01:24:21,034
I don't know how.

1159
01:24:21,285 --> 01:24:24,037
I think you do.

1160
01:24:24,288 --> 01:24:29,001
You've been chasing these things
since you were a little kid.

1161
01:24:29,251 --> 01:24:30,002
It's what you do.

1162
01:24:30,252 --> 01:24:34,756
Go. Do it.

1163
01:24:54,276 --> 01:24:56,987
You all right?

1164
01:24:57,237 --> 01:25:01,742
I thought you were going with Meg.

1165
01:25:03,243 --> 01:25:07,789
What is it?

1166
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:13,003
What is it?

1167
01:25:13,253 --> 01:25:17,758
I know how to make Dorothy fly.

1168
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:32,022
Of course.

1169
01:25:32,272 --> 01:25:34,024
Of course.

1170
01:25:34,274 --> 01:25:37,027
I need every aluminium can you can find.

1171
01:25:37,277 --> 01:25:39,029
We need cutters and duct tape.

1172
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:46,036
I want to get the last Dorothy on the
back of my truck. Both of them, now.

1173
01:25:46,286 --> 01:25:49,790
We're gone!

1174
01:26:52,269 --> 01:26:54,020
Are you ready?

1175
01:26:54,271 --> 01:26:57,023
We're good.

1176
01:26:57,274 --> 01:26:59,025
We're good? Good.

1177
01:26:59,276 --> 01:27:02,779
We're very good.

1178
01:27:08,285 --> 01:27:10,036
Let's go! Come on!

1179
01:27:10,287 --> 01:27:13,039
- You get them done?
- I think so.

1180
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:16,793
Beautiful.

1181
01:27:28,263 --> 01:27:29,014
Good?

1182
01:27:29,264 --> 01:27:31,016
Great job. Be ready to record.

1183
01:27:31,266 --> 01:27:33,018
Ready?

1184
01:27:33,268 --> 01:27:34,019
Be careful.

1185
01:27:34,269 --> 01:27:36,021
Don't follow too close.

1186
01:27:36,271 --> 01:27:39,774
You got it, boss!

1187
01:27:43,278 --> 01:27:47,782
We're back in business.

1188
01:27:49,284 --> 01:27:53,788
Come on, let's go.

1189
01:27:54,289 --> 01:27:56,041
Half a mile more?

1190
01:27:56,291 --> 01:27:59,044
Sounds right.

1191
01:27:59,294 --> 01:28:01,046
I'll put her in the road.

1192
01:28:01,296 --> 01:28:04,049
Won't someone hit it?

1193
01:28:04,257 --> 01:28:08,762
Nobody'll be there.

1194
01:28:18,271 --> 01:28:20,023
Hurry!

1195
01:28:20,273 --> 01:28:22,776
Let's go.

1196
01:28:29,282 --> 01:28:32,035
Okay, that's good!

1197
01:28:32,285 --> 01:28:36,790
- Got it?
- Let's go!

1198
01:28:39,292 --> 01:28:41,044
You in position?

1199
01:28:41,294 --> 01:28:44,798
Ready for contact!

1200
01:28:51,304 --> 01:28:53,056
This is it.

1201
01:28:53,306 --> 01:28:56,059
It'll work.

1202
01:28:56,309 --> 01:28:57,060
Just another minute.

1203
01:28:57,268 --> 01:29:01,773
We're ready!

1204
01:29:16,287 --> 01:29:18,039
Come on, come on, take her!

1205
01:29:18,289 --> 01:29:19,040
Too light.

1206
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:22,794
No, it's not.

1207
01:29:24,295 --> 01:29:28,800
- We're losing it.
- No, she can still fly.

1208
01:29:39,269 --> 01:29:42,772
Get in!

1209
01:29:52,282 --> 01:29:56,035
Oh, my God!

1210
01:29:56,286 --> 01:29:59,789
Get us off this thing!

1211
01:30:03,293 --> 01:30:06,796
Hurry!

1212
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:14,804
What is that?

1213
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:21,060
What is that?

1214
01:30:21,311 --> 01:30:24,063
Hurry!

1215
01:30:24,314 --> 01:30:27,817
Hurry!

1216
01:30:28,318 --> 01:30:31,821
This is not good!

1217
01:30:38,286 --> 01:30:40,788
Hurry!

1218
01:30:53,301 --> 01:30:56,804
Go!

1219
01:31:17,283 --> 01:31:20,036
Son-of-a-bitch!

1220
01:31:20,286 --> 01:31:22,038
Jo, Bill, you all right?

1221
01:31:22,288 --> 01:31:24,040
Can you guys hear me?

1222
01:31:24,290 --> 01:31:26,042
We're okay.

1223
01:31:26,292 --> 01:31:30,046
Jo, Bill, did you see that explosion?

1224
01:31:30,296 --> 01:31:34,801
We saw it.

1225
01:31:35,301 --> 01:31:38,054
This monster's moving north-east on 80!

1226
01:31:38,304 --> 01:31:39,055
Copy?!

1227
01:31:39,305 --> 01:31:41,057
This is it.

1228
01:31:41,307 --> 01:31:43,059
Last one.

1229
01:31:43,309 --> 01:31:46,062
Last time.

1230
01:31:46,312 --> 01:31:49,065
Mobile lab to Mobile One.
Ground speed is increasing.

1231
01:31:49,315 --> 01:31:52,068
The base is a mile wide.
We can't see it anymore.

1232
01:31:52,318 --> 01:31:53,069
What's your location?

1233
01:31:53,319 --> 01:31:58,074
I am right alongside her!
She's beautiful!

1234
01:31:58,324 --> 01:32:03,830
We're ready to play, so pull
back and prepare to monitor.

1235
01:32:06,332 --> 01:32:08,084
They had to be somewhere.

1236
01:32:08,334 --> 01:32:11,087
Path is stable, copy that.

1237
01:32:11,337 --> 01:32:12,046
Men...

1238
01:32:12,296 --> 01:32:14,048
...this is it.

1239
01:32:14,298 --> 01:32:16,050
Stay sharp back there.

1240
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:20,054
They have position.

1241
01:32:20,304 --> 01:32:23,057
They could make it.

1242
01:32:23,307 --> 01:32:28,813
Not unless they anchor the pack.

1243
01:32:30,314 --> 01:32:32,066
Jonas, can you hear me?

1244
01:32:32,316 --> 01:32:34,068
Not now.

1245
01:32:34,318 --> 01:32:37,071
Jonas, listen to me.
The pack is too light.

1246
01:32:37,321 --> 01:32:40,074
The twister'll toss it. Anchor it.

1247
01:32:40,324 --> 01:32:43,077
Sharing valuable information, Jo.

1248
01:32:43,327 --> 01:32:44,078
I'll consider that. Thanks.

1249
01:32:44,328 --> 01:32:46,080
Listen to me!

1250
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:48,082
What?

1251
01:32:48,332 --> 01:32:50,042
Can you see them?

1252
01:32:50,293 --> 01:32:51,043
Jonas, what's your position?

1253
01:32:51,294 --> 01:32:53,045
Howdy, Bill.

1254
01:32:53,296 --> 01:32:55,047
We're heading north-east, parallel...

1255
01:32:55,298 --> 01:32:58,050
...about to pull off
ahead of it on the left.

1256
01:32:58,301 --> 01:33:01,053
Hang back a minute. We got
a good view from back here.

1257
01:33:01,304 --> 01:33:05,057
She could shift or track and if
she does, she'll come right at you.

1258
01:33:05,308 --> 01:33:08,060
Let's do that. He'd never
put us in harm's way.

1259
01:33:08,311 --> 01:33:11,063
When I want your opinion, I'll give it.

1260
01:33:11,314 --> 01:33:14,066
Shut up, put your foot on
the gas, and stay on course.

1261
01:33:14,317 --> 01:33:15,067
It's unbelievable!

1262
01:33:15,318 --> 01:33:16,068
What's wrong?

1263
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:19,071
The base is so huge!
It must be at least a mile wide!

1264
01:33:19,322 --> 01:33:21,073
Do you copy?

1265
01:33:21,324 --> 01:33:22,074
Listen to me!

1266
01:33:22,325 --> 01:33:24,076
Get off this frequency!

1267
01:33:24,327 --> 01:33:26,078
She's shifting.

1268
01:33:26,329 --> 01:33:30,082
Oh, my God.

1269
01:33:30,333 --> 01:33:32,084
Jonas, I'm telling you!

1270
01:33:32,335 --> 01:33:35,087
Eddie, I know you can hear me!

1271
01:33:35,338 --> 01:33:38,841
Get out!

1272
01:33:44,347 --> 01:33:47,808
Look out!

1273
01:34:14,335 --> 01:34:16,087
Damn!

1274
01:34:16,337 --> 01:34:19,090
Stupid!

1275
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:21,092
We tried.

1276
01:34:21,342 --> 01:34:25,805
We can do nothing.

1277
01:34:27,306 --> 01:34:31,060
- Yes, we can.
- Ground speed is increasing.

1278
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:36,816
Get ahead of it quickly,
or she'll bury you.

1279
01:34:57,336 --> 01:34:59,088
We have debris!

1280
01:34:59,338 --> 01:35:02,842
Right!

1281
01:35:04,343 --> 01:35:07,847
Right!

1282
01:35:08,347 --> 01:35:10,850
Left!

1283
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:16,105
- What now?
- I have no idea.

1284
01:35:16,355 --> 01:35:19,108
You still with us?

1285
01:35:19,358 --> 01:35:21,110
Oh, my God.

1286
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:25,823
I think we're going in.

1287
01:35:42,339 --> 01:35:44,091
Maybe we should get off this road.

1288
01:35:44,341 --> 01:35:46,093
You may be right.

1289
01:35:46,343 --> 01:35:49,096
Are you okay?

1290
01:35:49,346 --> 01:35:50,097
You set up?

1291
01:35:50,347 --> 01:35:53,100
- We're set. You going in?
- We are.

1292
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:55,060
- You ready?
- I'm on it.

1293
01:35:55,311 --> 01:35:58,814
Be careful.

1294
01:36:10,326 --> 01:36:13,829
She's up.

1295
01:36:19,335 --> 01:36:20,085
Where are they?

1296
01:36:20,336 --> 01:36:25,090
Doppler tracking is great!
Wind speed increasing!

1297
01:36:25,341 --> 01:36:29,845
I've never seen anything like this.

1298
01:36:31,347 --> 01:36:34,850
They're going to punch the core.

1299
01:36:45,361 --> 01:36:48,113
Ready?

1300
01:36:48,364 --> 01:36:51,116
Let me set the cruise control.

1301
01:36:51,367 --> 01:36:53,118
We're good.

1302
01:36:53,369 --> 01:36:55,079
On three?

1303
01:36:55,329 --> 01:36:58,832
On three.

1304
01:37:00,334 --> 01:37:03,837
Go!

1305
01:37:11,345 --> 01:37:12,096
Ready?

1306
01:37:12,346 --> 01:37:14,098
Ready.

1307
01:37:14,348 --> 01:37:15,099
One!

1308
01:37:15,349 --> 01:37:16,100
Two!

1309
01:37:16,350 --> 01:37:19,853
Three!

1310
01:37:30,322 --> 01:37:32,074
Go...

1311
01:37:32,324 --> 01:37:33,075
...go...

1312
01:37:33,325 --> 01:37:37,830
...go! Go!

1313
01:37:58,350 --> 01:38:00,102
Dorothy's flying!

1314
01:38:00,352 --> 01:38:02,104
She's flying!

1315
01:38:02,354 --> 01:38:03,105
Look!

1316
01:38:03,355 --> 01:38:04,106
We're in!

1317
01:38:04,356 --> 01:38:07,109
I don't believe it! We're in!

1318
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:09,111
We'll be very popular!

1319
01:38:09,361 --> 01:38:11,113
- She's flying!
- Look at that!

1320
01:38:11,363 --> 01:38:14,116
It's beautiful. It's working.
It's Christmas time.

1321
01:38:14,366 --> 01:38:16,118
We're inside! It's working!

1322
01:38:16,368 --> 01:38:19,121
- Dorothy did it!
- I'm getting readings!

1323
01:38:19,371 --> 01:38:22,124
This is it! We did it, man!

1324
01:38:22,374 --> 01:38:25,836
We just made history.

1325
01:38:26,336 --> 01:38:30,841
You guys, it's about to shift north-east.

1326
01:38:32,342 --> 01:38:35,095
You should get out of there!
Do you copy?

1327
01:38:35,345 --> 01:38:39,850
Do you copy?

1328
01:38:43,353 --> 01:38:46,857
Run!

1329
01:39:19,348 --> 01:39:23,852
The barn! Come on!

1330
01:39:24,353 --> 01:39:27,856
Look out!

1331
01:39:33,362 --> 01:39:34,112
Here!

1332
01:39:34,363 --> 01:39:38,867
Go! Hurry!

1333
01:39:40,369 --> 01:39:44,873
To the barn!

1334
01:39:54,383 --> 01:39:57,844
Stay down!

1335
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:06,103
My God! Who are these people?

1336
01:40:06,353 --> 01:40:09,856
I don't think so.

1337
01:40:11,358 --> 01:40:14,861
Quick!

1338
01:40:25,372 --> 01:40:28,125
Oh, my God!

1339
01:40:28,375 --> 01:40:31,837
Come on!

1340
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:39,845
Run for it!

1341
01:40:59,364 --> 01:41:02,868
Get down!

1342
01:41:03,368 --> 01:41:07,873
Come on!

1343
01:41:34,357 --> 01:41:35,108
Here!

1344
01:41:35,358 --> 01:41:42,866
These pipes go down at least 30 feet.
We anchor to it, we may have a chance!

1345
01:41:44,367 --> 01:41:46,119
No good!

1346
01:41:46,369 --> 01:41:49,873
This!

1347
01:41:50,373 --> 01:41:54,878
Get in!

1348
01:42:05,347 --> 01:42:08,850
Hold on!

1349
01:42:31,373 --> 01:42:34,876
Hang on!

1350
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:16,895
- You all right?
- Are you?

1351
01:44:25,403 --> 01:44:28,156
Look at that.

1352
01:44:28,406 --> 01:44:32,911
It didn't take the house.

1353
01:44:38,374 --> 01:44:40,126
We did it.

1354
01:44:40,376 --> 01:44:41,127
Yeah, we did.

1355
01:44:41,377 --> 01:44:43,129
Dorothy really flew.

1356
01:44:43,379 --> 01:44:47,884
It was a good idea.

1357
01:44:49,385 --> 01:44:53,139
We've got so much to do.

1358
01:44:53,389 --> 01:44:55,141
I'll get grant approval
for a warning system.

1359
01:44:55,391 --> 01:44:58,144
We need a bigger lab.
You must start analysing data.

1360
01:44:58,394 --> 01:45:00,146
I do?

1361
01:45:00,396 --> 01:45:04,150
We must generate models of the
data, and I must run the lab.

1362
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,152
You do the analysis, I'll run the lab.

1363
01:45:06,402 --> 01:45:11,908
You're running the lab?
I don't think so.

1364
01:45:14,410 --> 01:45:19,123
Do you always have to
do things the hard way?

1365
01:45:19,374 --> 01:45:24,128
We got it, guys! The sensors worked!
The computers went crazy! We got data!

1366
01:45:24,379 --> 01:45:27,131
It's the biggest twister on record!

1367
01:45:27,382 --> 01:45:31,135
Check out that sky.

1368
01:45:31,386 --> 01:45:34,138
You know what?
I think we've seen enough.
