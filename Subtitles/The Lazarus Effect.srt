2
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,960
It's still alive!

3
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,042
- Good morning, Dr. McConnell.
- Good morning, James. She's with me.

4
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,283
Um, we're operating under a grant
from Werner-Goss Biotechnical,

5
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,046
so you're gonna need to sign
a confidentiality agreement.

6
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,371
Uh, Niko, this is Eva.

7
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,205
- She's gonna be working with us.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

8
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,761
- This is Clay.
- Hey.

9
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,801
OK.

10
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,326
We are... rolling.

11
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,769
Hi, I am Dr. Frank Walton.

12
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,643
And I am Dr. Zoe McConnell.

13
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:17,771
- What? No, what?
- Sorry.

14
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,764
You're like Kelly Ripa. You're like...

15
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,565
- OK.
- We are still rolling.

16
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,767
Hi, I'm Dr. Frank Walton.

17
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,321
I am the head researcher
at the Lazarus Project.

18
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,165
- And I am Dr. Zoe McConnell.
- And welcome to our laboratory.

19
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,283
- Welcome to our laboratory.
- You were so late!

20
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,487
- I can do that better.
- So late.

21
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,130
- How we doing?
- Was that OK?

22
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,851
This whole process started
with Zoe's big breakthrough.

23
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,721
She bonded fast-growth B-cell tumors,
which sped up the nerve fiber regrowth.

24
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,360
That created the Lazarus serum.

25
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,127
Over here, we have Niko to thank for
this Millennium Falcon-looking thing.

26
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,566
This is called the pulse array.

27
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,167
The pulse array then uses
timed electrical charges

28
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,924
to activate the serum.

29
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,965
Then we jump-start the neural reactions

30
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,124
by stimulating different parts
of the brain with electrical charges.

31
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,729
This is an articulated arm we developed
as an extension of the pulse array.

32
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,486
This goes into the temporal lobe
of the brain,

33
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,688
the serum ﬂows into the brain,

34
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,208
we pull that switch right over there,
and then we hope for the best.

35
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,691
The goal here is simple:

36
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,162
To give health care professionals
more time to do their jobs.

37
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,847
To prolong that period
where you can safely bring someone back,

38
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,647
with no cognitive loss,
no long-term effects.

39
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,804
It's about giving everyone
that second chance they deserve.

40
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,361
You're such a dick.

41
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,000
I am the Lord of Catan,
and I deserve your respect!

42
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,447
That is a dick move
because I have no cards...

43
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,483
Hey, guys,
I don't have any cell service.

44
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,405
Um, we don't get much service
in the sub-basement,

45
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,961
but there's a landline on the wall
if you need it.

46
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,529
Oh, no. I'm good, thanks.

47
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,280
Documentary girl, man, she is so hot.

48
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,886
- Her name's Eva.
- I don't care what her name is.

49
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,203
I'd tap that. You wouldn't tap that?

50
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,691
She's all right.

51
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,810
You're ridiculous.

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,322
OK, so, um... most of this stuff is...

53
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,528
Basically run by me,
and I do everything.

54
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,282
- What do you think?
- I mean, does it matter?

55
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,125
It's not like we can send her home now.

56
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,931
Come on.
This could be a really good thing.

57
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,481
- I say we give her a chance.
- She's cute.

58
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,042
Yeah, she's gorgeous.
Super sexy with her red hair...

59
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,646
Get out. You're fired.

60
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,691
- I love you.
- Aw...

61
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,250
I'm so sorry. Not funny.
I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry.

62
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,765
- No. I didn't...
- I'm sorry.

63
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,046
I didn't mean to scream.

64
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,409
A dental dam sounds like something
a dentist would use, does it not?

65
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,523
No, it doesn't.
You should've known what it was.

66
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,728
I wasn't getting as much action
as you think I was.

67
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,770
We were 22. You should've known by then
that that's what that's for.

68
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,241
It's not like an orthodontic thing.

69
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,407
So, um... how are you doing?

70
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,520
You know, with everything?

71
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,445
Frank?

72
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,406
You know, good.

73
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,323
It's just, when we got the grant,

74
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,962
we decided the wedding and...
everything else would just be put off.

75
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,963
You know? This is more important.

76
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,600
But that was... three years ago?

77
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,891
You look at him, it's like
he doesn't even remember a time before.

78
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,930
It's just all about the work.

79
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,483
Yeah, well... maybe it's the universe
trying to tell you something.

80
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,765
Yeah. Finish the damn project, right?

81
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,048
- Yeah.
- Anyway, thank you for the sushi.

82
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,163
- No problem.
- Better get back to work.

83
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,649
Hey, lady.

84
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,449
Same dream?

85
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,729
I'm sorry.

86
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,883
Take your time. I'll be in the bed
when you're ready, OK?

87
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,281
- Thank you.
- Snuggle you up.

88
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,084
- Wait for it.
- OK, that all looks right.

89
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,007
Yeah, just wait. Right... there.

90
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,721
See, something's degrading the
lipid bi-layer, and it all falls apart.

91
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,325
Could be the diffusion barrier.

92
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,651
Clay, what did I say
about smoking in here?

93
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,211
Uh, that it's awesome?

94
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,362
- You're a jerk.
- Guys, let's not be children.

95
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,648
- What's the membrane voltage?
- Minus 60. Maybe less.

96
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,121
OK, so we just increase
the depolarization.

97
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,302
Then that fries our ion channels.

98
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,771
Not if you introduce
a potassium-selective insulator

99
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,481
into the serum and limit pulse durations
to about 30 milliseconds.

100
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,843
Give the pH and oxygen tension
time to snap back.

101
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,047
Boom!

102
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,725
What? Got shit on my face?

103
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,840
I think that might work.

104
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,211
- Clay, you're all grown up!
- Yeah! All right!

105
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,600
Holy shit. Look at this guy.

106
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,001
- I can smoke in here now.
- He can smoke in here now.

107
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,926
- No, no, no. Give me...
- Let's do this, come on.

108
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,409
Cataracts in both eyes.
Probably why they put him down.

109
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,208
All inputs within range.

110
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,330
Blood oxygen looks good.
Serum level optimal.

111
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,889
OK. Let's do this. Start the tone.

112
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,282
Event one, five kilovolts.
Pulse in three, two, one.

113
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,161
No effect.

114
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,802
Reset the array, 11 kilovolts.

115
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,157
11 kilovolts. Stand by.

116
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,604
OK, event two. Pulse in three, two, one.

117
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:23,731
- Clay?
- Nothing.

118
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,042
- Jesus Christ... What?
- Oh!

119
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,000
- It moved. I-I think it just moved.
- It moved, or you think it moved?

120
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,969
I don't know.
It did like a twitching thing or...

121
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,610
I'm telling you,
I'm flat across the board.

122
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,967
Yeah, it's probably just
reflex muscle stimulation.

123
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,003
No, I saw it. It actually moved.

124
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,931
Yeah, that's what muscle stimulation is.

125
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,767
I don't know, maybe if we
up the dosage next time...

126
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,407
Pulse! Clay! Pulse?

127
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,769
Hey, hey, hey. You're OK.

128
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,761
Oh, my God.

129
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,331
We're six minutes in and he is golden.

130
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,129
- That's weird.
- What's up?

131
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,521
- His cataracts are gone.
- What are you talking about?

132
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,444
He has mature stage five cataracts
in both eyes.

133
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,080
- Yes, I know. Look.
- Hm.

134
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,687
- Could it be the serum?
- Or... we just cured blindness.

135
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,962
Look, guys, it brings up a good point.

136
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,009
I don't want anybody
talking about anything

137
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,242
until we know exactly what we have here.

138
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,401
Understood?

139
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,890
- Clay?
- Bible.

140
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,566
We're gonna take Rocky home with us
and we'll look after him.

141
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,087
- If that's OK.
- Sure.

142
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,523
Hey!

143
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,410
Um, Eva, put the camera down.
Put it down.

144
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:03,128
I really don't want this to be filmed.

145
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,891
All right.

146
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,525
Cheers.

147
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:22,243
Here you go.

148
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,129
He has no interest.

149
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,041
- What's his name again?
- Rocky.

150
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,047
- Rocky.
- The ultimate underdog.

151
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,202
Back from the dead, Rocky.

152
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,287
It's not just me, right?
He's a little weird.

153
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,603
Yeah, I think he's in shock right now,
you know?

154
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,207
It's gonna take him a few days to
sort of re-stitch those neural pathways,

155
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,169
and he'll be good to go.

156
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,890
Yeah.

157
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,762
You don't... You don't seem convinced.
What's going on?

158
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,530
I don't know. I mean...

159
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,842
what if we ripped him
out of doggie heaven or something?

160
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,087
You know what I mean. What if...

161
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,767
We don't know if he wanted to come back.
We just took him.

162
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,651
What is it with you?
I get two glasses of red wine in you

163
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,802
and the Catholic girl comes out and...

164
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,606
I'm just saying,
if we're gonna be asking big questions,

165
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,808
we have to be ready for the answers.

166
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,887
Come here. Come here.

167
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,570
Look...

168
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,880
I know this is... strange, you know?

169
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,284
And what we're doing here could be...
considered questionable.

170
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,561
Yeah.

171
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,240
But we're gonna help
a lot of people with this work.

172
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,402
It's gonna be worth it, OK?

173
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,045
OK.

174
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,490
Rocky! Get the ball.

175
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,130
Hey, guys, do you think he remembers?
Dying?

176
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,329
Mm... Dogs don't have memories, so, no.

177
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,126
- Dogs definitely have memories.
- Dogs form associations.

178
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,647
Leash means walk. Keys mean car ride.
It's not the same thing, bro.

179
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,282
That's what a memory is, man.
It's like... No, we're settling this.

180
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,011
- Settle it. Let's look it up, bitch.
- I don't wanna hear your shit.

181
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,328
OK. I'm cool with that.

182
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,041
Hey, Rocky, what do you think?
Did you see a big white light? Huh?

183
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,441
You know, that part's actually true.

184
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,570
- You know what the pineal gland is?
- No.

185
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,202
It produces DMT, which is
the base compound for our serum.

186
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,931
Basically, nobody knows why,
but the moment you die,

187
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,483
right then, your brain just floods your
system with this massive blast of DMT,

188
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,206
which is the most potent psychedelic
on the planet.

189
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,807
And when you think you're seeing
the light at the end of the tunnel,

190
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,169
or the blessed Virgin Mary, um...

191
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,600
- Did I do that the wrong way?
- Mm-mm.

192
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,242
Anyway, it's just a big trip that
you're having, really, it's all it is.

193
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,361
- I disagree. I do.
- Oh, you disagree, really?

194
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,729
- We've had this discussion before.
- Yeah, I just think you can't discount

195
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,087
every near-death experience
based on one theory.

196
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,810
Of course. But if you're going
to make a bet,

197
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,968
why not bet on a scientific theory

198
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,681
as opposed to, you know,
St. Peter and the pearly white gates?

199
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,723
- Why?
- Because one is empirical and one is,

200
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,763
you know, it's a cute story, but it's...

201
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,730
No, it's not. I mean, whatever you
wanna call it, the soul, consciousness,

202
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,488
it's just neural impulses firing in
your brain, right? That makes it energy.

203
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,205
Energy can't be created or destroyed,

204
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,806
it can just be transformed
from one thing to another.

205
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,486
So that's not superstition,
that's science.

206
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,130
So what's your theory?

207
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,607
I think, maybe when we die, the DMT
is there to help our souls move on,

208
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,683
to get them wherever
they're supposed to be.

209
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,801
- You know, open the door for them.
- So the DMT is like a doorman

210
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,883
who is like,
"Here. Here's life, here's death.

211
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,684
I'm gonna open this up
and usher you through."

212
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,205
- Maybe.
- And you give him a tip.

213
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,727
I just think it's arrogant
to reduce everything that happens

214
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,969
at the moment of death
to one chemical equation.

215
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,610
The fact is, we just don't know.

216
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,848
Yet.

217
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,166
- Whoa. What's the HDR?
- Uh, 2.2 seconds.

218
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,850
That's well within levels.

219
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,489
Whoa. That's weird.

220
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,483
The serum is still present
in the bloodstream.

221
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,961
Yeah, it's supposed to dissipate within,
like, a few hours.

222
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,527
Man, there's some crazy activity
going on in the brain stem.

223
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,047
Are you guys sure you wanna
keep this thing in your house?

224
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,487
- Why?
- One of the symptoms of hypothyroidism

225
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,005
is extreme aggression.

226
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,367
This thing could
go Cujo here in a hurry.

227
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,447
It's alive! It's alive!

228
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,824
Come here.

229
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,024
You are my friend.

230
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,570
Shit!

231
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,211
Niko?

232
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,761
Whoa.

233
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,928
Shit.

234
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,560
Rocky?

235
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,325
Here, boy.

236
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,324
Come here, you little shit.

237
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,341
It's OK, bud.

238
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,049
You're just freaking out, man.

239
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,124
Shit. OK, OK, OK.

240
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,885
If you ask me, I think we should
put that thing down, now.

241
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,805
- At least you're not overreacting.
- Overreacting, my ass!

242
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,088
OK? There's something
seriously wrong with that animal.

243
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,328
It's like it was possessed or something.

244
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,802
- How long were you out of the room?
- I don't know, 20 seconds, tops.

245
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,804
- And no, I wasn't smoking.
- Hey, guys?

246
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,171
This stuff was on the top shelf,
and even if you left the cage open,

247
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,402
there's no way he could've got up here.

248
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,923
OK, so far, we've seen
three distinct phases of development.

249
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,211
Phase one: Subject is resuscitated
through an infusion of LAZ-510 serum

250
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,886
and targeted electrical stimulation.

251
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,329
Phase two: The serum remains in
the bloodstream longer than anticipated.

252
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,084
Phase three: Metabolic functions

253
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,851
produce a potentially disruptive
hormonal imbalance.

254
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,925
Subject shows signs of confusion,
loss of appetite,

255
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,521
and marked signs of aggression.

256
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,241
Now we're in phase four, I guess.

257
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,210
The subject's brain
continues to create new neural pathways

258
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,284
at an unprecedented and alarming rate.

259
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,131
Jesus! Oh, my God,
you scared the shit out of me.

260
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,009
You coming to bed?

261
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,050
Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle
of something. I'll be there in a minute.

262
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,805
OK.

263
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,526
What the hell is going on here?

264
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,086
Dr. Walton,
can you hold on for a second?

265
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,810
- Uh, yeah.
- I'll meet you downstairs.

266
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,246
Sure.

267
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,925
The dean needs to talk to you.

268
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,482
Honestly, did you for one second
consider the implications of this?

269
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,842
Eighty-three percent of our student body
identify as religious.

270
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,891
You throw in the alumni donors,
that number's more like 90 percent.

271
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,805
Don't play the religious card.
This has nothing to do with religion.

272
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,123
You were the one who decided
to do an unsanctioned experiment,

273
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,089
in direct violation of the Review Board

274
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,163
and the grant agreement
which you signed.

275
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,761
Which says, you were
going to "study new methods

276
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,400
of arresting neural decay
in coma patients."

277
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,767
Yes, exactly! That is how it started.

278
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,571
But how do you think that penicillin
was discovered? Or Teflon?

279
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,769
Or even Coca-Cola, for that matter?
Accidents that happen in the lab.

280
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,201
Accidents that lead
to new lines of inquiry.

281
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,763
You are a doctor, you understand
how science works. It's by adapting.

282
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,130
You're not adapting. You are playing God
with a bunch of dead animals.

283
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,044
You had to know this was coming.

284
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,562
How do you know all this?

285
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,242
No way you could've known
about those animal trials.

286
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,601
We have the right to review any material
that's posted to our server,

287
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,967
- including video footage.
- Bullshit.

288
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,925
Somebody fed this to you, specifically
to get this project shut down.

289
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,485
Was it one of your big pharma friends?

290
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,531
Did somebody donate a medical wing
or a new student union?

291
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,727
Who was it?

292
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,851
Pull the hard drives,
any security key cards.

293
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,162
- Hey...
- Any samples.

294
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,886
- Any and all samples you may find.
- What is this?

295
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,441
- Oh, you must be Dr. McConnell.
- Yes.

296
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,762
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've been a fan of your work.

297
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,843
Effective immediately,
all research material

298

300
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,003
- Stop. What?
- Hey, that's personal property, man!

301
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,003
I don't understand.
We're operating under a grant

302
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,561
- from Werner-Goss Biotechnical.
- And as of two hours ago,

303
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,803
Crylonis Industries became the
principal shareholder in Werner-Goss.

304
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,964
- No, you can't do this.
- Pursuant to the grant agreement

305

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,163
and revert intellectual property rights
back to the holding corporation."

308
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,926
Which is, in this case, us.

309
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,809
I'm sure it must be difficult for you,

310
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,485
but there's an important lesson
to be learned here:

311
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,641
There's always a consequence
for breaking the rules.

312
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,849
- What happened?
- They took everything.

313
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,482
You have to admit
it's quite the coincidence.

314
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,644
You show up out of nowhere,
videotape everything, and then poof,

315
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,922
they take it all,
including our backup data.

316
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,050
Hang on. We made her keep all the
footage in the lab. It's not her fault.

317
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,929
We lost everything.

318
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,243
Four years of our lives,
our reputations, everything.

319
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,926
If it's not her, then please tell me,
what the hell happened?

320
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,401
If they wanted the serum,
why didn't they just hire us?

321
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,126
I mean, let's imagine for a second
that you're Crylonis, OK?

322
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,044
And you find out
about the Lazarus serum.

323
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,089
You realize this thing is a gold mine,

324
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,886
and you also realize
that Werner-Goss sponsored it.

325
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,407
So you buy Werner-Goss,
that's the first thing right there.

326
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,723
Then you realize all is takes is
one anonymous call to the Review Board,

327
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,531
and all of a sudden
you own everything in that lab.

328
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,727
You have the legal rights.

329
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,121
Suddenly, you're not
splitting the profits anymore.

330
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,123
All that money is yours.

331
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,601
Come on.
They're not gonna spend $50 million

332
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,411
just to get our serum, right?

333
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,964
We're gonna duplicate the experiment.
It's the only way.

334
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,566
- You're joking, right?
- What, we're gonna walk away now?

335
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,121
We have no proof. No one's ever
gonna believe that it was us.

336
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,408
We're never gonna have
another chance at this, OK?

337
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,847
Look, they're not gonna start
cleaning the lab till tomorrow, right?

338
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,809
That gives us at least,
what, like 12 hours?

339
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,247
We break in there,
we duplicate the experiment.

340
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,482
You film it,
and we take back what's ours.

341
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,325
Duplicate it how?
I mean, they took all the serum.

342
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,530
We figured, just in case.

343
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,800
The lab is on a time lock,
there is only one security guard,

344
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,650
we know exactly what his route is.

345
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,171
This is absolutely doable.

346
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,687
And how are we supposed to get in?
They took our key cards.

347
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,610
Not all of them.

348
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,124
Working late?

349
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,324
Dr. Jackson wants me to take him in
for overnight observation.

350
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,642
Just the way I wanted
to spend my Friday night.

351
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,324
- You know where you're going?
- Sure do.

352
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,045
Look, if you get caught here,
you're gonna get expelled, or worse,

353
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,931
so no one's gonna blame you
if you wanna take off now.

354
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,131
I know.

355
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,163
- How's it looking?
- On a scale of one to shitty,

356
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,044
their security system is shitty.

357
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,322
Great. Can we just loop that?

358
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,727
- Loop it?
- Yeah, like they do on TV.

359
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,691
Or I could just stop it from recording.
It's not like he's gonna notice.

360
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,888
That works.

361
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,008
- "You're amazing, Niko."
- You're amazing, Niko.

362
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,487
Thank you, Zoe.

363
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,521
Dog.

364
00:31:34,007 --> 00:31:35,091
All right, Eva, you rolling?

365
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,521
- Yeah, rolling.
- OK, Clay, how we doing?

366
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,681
Cells appear healthy.

367
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,970
- Full diffusion in 30.
- OK. I need 45cc's Trimexialin.

368
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,208
- Niko, how you doing?
- Uh, neural overlay synced.

369
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,570
- Capacitors charged. Ready when you are.
- Serum blood ratio is 6.8.

370
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,963
- Oxygen levels look good.
- Great. Check on the guard, please.

371
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,281
Yeah, he's still there.

372
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,164
OK, let's make some history.

373
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,047
Again.

374
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,166
You wanna do the honors?

375
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,087
Event one, 11 kilowatts,
in three, two, one.

376
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,801
I didn't do it.

377
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,883
Shit. Somebody flipped the breaker.

378
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,888
Zoe!

379
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,445
Sweetie? No pulse! No pulse!
She's been electrocuted.

380
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,604
- Get me an adrenalin shot right now!
- What can I do? What can I do?

381
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,808
- Come on, Zoe!
- What can I...?

382
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,801
Here you go.

383
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,842
No pulse. No pulse. OK.

384
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,321
- I need the defibrillator right now.
- I got it, I got it.

385
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,249
- All right, move her off the grate.
- OK.

386
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,447
One, two, three!

387
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,762
OK. Shit.

388
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,080
- 200 joules!
- 200?

389
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,067
Yeah.

390
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:04,255
Clear!

391
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,368
Sweetheart? There's no pulse.
There's no pulse.

392
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,602
- Clay, 360 joules.
- Way too high.

393
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,869
360! 360 joules! Do it!

394
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:16,327
Come on.

395
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,314
Clear!

396
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,410
No pulse. Come on, Zoe. Come on!

397
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,847
Come on! Come on!

398
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,041
Come on, come on.

399
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,130
Come on, sweetie.

400
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,681
Come on! Come on.

401
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,605
Frank, what are you doing?

402
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,566
- No! No! Absolutely not. No.
- Whoa... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

403
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,846
Can we just talk about this a second,
man?

404
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,808
There's nothing to talk about.
The serum works, we know it works.

405
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,048
Yeah, but what if she comes back
all messed up like the dog?

406
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,931
Not gonna happen! I'm gonna adjust
the dosage and tailor the levels.

407
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,048
- It'll be fine.
- Frank, I want her back, too,

408
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,771
but if the cops come
and we're cutting up a human body,

409
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,571
- we're going to jail, all of us.
- Do you think I care about jail?

410
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,161
- Frank, this isn't some lab experiment.
- I know!

411
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,130
This is a person. You're talking about
bringing someone back from the dead.

412
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,567
- We've done it before. It's gonna work.
- Not like this.

413
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,169
I am so sorry, but this is
crossing a line. This is a human being!

414
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,562
Fine. Get outta here.
I'm gonna do it myself.

415
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,931
- Frank, come on, man.
- I am not gonna lose her.

416
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,851
Not like this.

417
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,042
Thank you. Thank you.

418
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,331
I need you to pull the switch.

419
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:11,604
Niko, we good?

420
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,370
Half of this stuff is fried.
I can't read...

421
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,806
Niko, are we good?

422
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,048
- Yeah, we're good.
- OK.

423
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,083
Clay, tone. Starting event one,
9.5 kilovolts.

424
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:26,649
Here we go. Three, two, one.

425
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,280
- Clay.
- I got nothing.

426
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,884
We're going again, 13 kilovolts.

427
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,287
- That's gonna fry...
- Do it right now, 13 kilovolts.

428
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,329
Starting event two.

429
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,563
Here we go in three, two, one.

430
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,761
Clay.

431
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,363
- Where's the guard?
- Who cares? We're going again.

432
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,085
- Reset the array.
- Where's the guard?

433
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,242
- Find the guard, Niko!
- I need you. Going 15 kilovolts.

434
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,521
Just hold on! Wait.

435
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,121
He's coming.

436
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,442
- What is...
- Can't help her in jail, all right?

437
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,601
All right? Let's go.

438
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,250
Shit.

439
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,243
- Come on.
- Shit.

440
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,803
- Careful.
- All right. We're good, we're good.

441
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,525
Damn it. He's coming.

442
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,921
Holy shit.

443
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,411
Hey, hey. It's me.

444
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,810
Hey. Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

445
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,325
She's in shock.
I need a blanket, please.

446
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,887
Yeah. Yeah, I'll...

447
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,806
Hey... Baby, it's me. You're OK.

448
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,201
- Frank? I can't find them.
- Get me the blanket. Hurry up!

449
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,725
Right over there. In the top...

450
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,411
Did I just die?

451
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,321
OK...

452
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,446
You're good.

453
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,566
What was it like?

454
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,882
Well, I mean... did you see anything?

455
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,210
- Like heaven or...
- You know,

456
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,771
this might not be the best time.

457
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,321
Start breaking down the lab.
Let's set up the MRI.

458
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,211
I want to do these diagnostics and
get out of here as soon as possible, OK?

459
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,041
Yeah.

460
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,082
And there goes the guard.

461
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,645
We're clear.

462
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,930
All right, let's get this over with.

463
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,644
Awesome.

464
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,282
- That's not right.
- What?

465
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,121
I don't know. Frank,
you want to come take a look at this?

466
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,725
What?

467
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,602
Not only is her body
almost completely healed,

468
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,842
but that's too much neural activity.

469
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,163
Yeah, that's too much.
I want to get her out of there.

470
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,130
We'll retest her in an hour, once
the serum has had a chance to dissipate.

471
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,930
I'm sorry,
but do you not remember the dog?

472
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,730
The serum still has not dissipated.

473
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,282
Yes, that was a goddamn dog.
This is a person. Let her out of there.

474
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,926
Clay!

475
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,925
What's going on?

476
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,771
You know how they say humans
only use ten percent of their brain?

477
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,571
- I thought that was a myth.
- No, the myth is that we don't know

478
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,051
what the other 90 percent does.

479
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,682
Humans use their entire brain,
we just use ten percent at a time.

480
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,041
She's just sitting in there.

481
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,884
A small chunk of her brain
should be lighting up.

482
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,526
But... the whole thing is lit up.

483
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,721
Yeah. That's the weird part.

484
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,724
Just take a seat, OK?

485
00:41:52,694 --> 00:41:54,210
All right.

486
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,646
- How are you?
- Shouldn't we be going to the hospital?

487
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,240
Look, we have
all the same equipment here,

488
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,324
and there's nobody more qualified
to take care of you than me.

489
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,403
They don't understand this.

490
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,483
Just gonna get you stable first, OK?

491
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,127
Hey.

492
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,566
You're gonna be OK.

493
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,923
- I thought I lost you.
- You did.

494
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,049
But I didn't.

495
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,243
I have something for you.

496
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,568
Gimme this.

497
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,529
Ah, shit. Sorry. Sorry.

498
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,165
OK. Um...

499
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,369
Here. Can't believe I'm doing this.

500
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,245
This is the one and only time
I go Catholic.

501
00:42:57,434 --> 00:42:59,244
But this once.

502
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,284
Thank you.

503
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,281
It's good to hear you laugh.

504
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,724
Something's definitely wrong.

505
00:43:10,348 --> 00:43:11,645
What?

506
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,521
- What did you just say?
- I didn't say anything.

507
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,411
Are you OK?

508
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,967
Yeah. Yeah.

509
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,929
I think I'm just tired.

510
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,321
- You've just been through...
- "A traumatic experience.

511
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,768
You need to let your body heal.
Just try to take it easy, OK?

512
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,490
I'll be right outside the door."

513
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,361
What?

514
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,891
Nothing.

515
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,249
Gonna come check on you in a second.
I'll be right back.

516
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,925
OK.

517
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,806
Hey.

518
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,761
I love you.

519
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,885
I love you, too.

520
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,403
Oh, my God, this is a mistake.
I should not be here.

521
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,649
We actually killed someone.
I killed someone.

522
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,290
I know this isn't right.

523
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,426
This is such a bad idea.
Did you not see the dog?

524
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:49,845
The serum stays in the brain.

525
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,402
We can't cover this up.
That's not Zoe in there.

526
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,449
We shouldn't have brought her back.

527
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,567
I need more time.
I'm gonna fix it, though.

528
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,165
I'm gonna fix this.

529
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,527
There is something very wrong with her.

530
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,365
Just keep making her think
everything's fine.

531
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,329
Letting her know
that she's gonna be fine.

532
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,371
Hey.

533
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,642
I think something's wrong.

534
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,770
OK, OK, all right, you're OK.
Come here. Come here. You're OK.

535
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,969
- No. No, I'm not OK. I'm not OK.
- You're OK. You're all right.

536
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,246
Something's happening.

537
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,562
- Something happened. I'm changing.
- OK, OK...

538
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,802
OK, shh. Calm down. What's happening?

539
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,566
I can hear things. I can see things.

540
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,921
Look, look at my hand.

541
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,481
Wait...

542
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,086
- There's nothing wrong with your hand.
- Frank, when I died, I went somewhere.

543
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,290
I was in the building. I was there.

544
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,084
I could hear the people,
they were stuck!

545
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,765
Zoe, that was a dream.

546
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,127
It's a traumatic memory
from your childhood. It's not real.

547
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,688
That's what I thought.
I couldn't wake up.

548
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,525
I was stuck. It was endless. I tried.

549
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,604
It went on and on.
And every day, I was there.

550
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,728
It was the same, over and over.
Every single day.

551
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,723
Zoe, you were gone
for less than an hour.

552
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,003
- You were right here. You didn't...
- Oh, no, no. You don't understand.

553
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,324
It's been years.
I've been in there for years.

554
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,368
Look, listen to me, OK?

555
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,921
Your brain was failing
due to the lack of oxygen.

556
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,764
You're hallucinating from the DMT.

557
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,922
This is a terrible memory
from your childhood,

558
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,924
- but it's playing in a traumatic loop.
- No. It was hell.

559
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,002
That's what hell is.

560
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,487
You relive the worst moment of your life
on a loop, over and over,

561
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,642
and you can never wake up.

562
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,526
Listen, you're here.
You are here now and you are awake.

563
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,369
You're fine.

564
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,604
- Yeah.
- OK.

565
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,723
OK.

566
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,162
All right, that's just gonna
help you sleep a little bit, OK?

567
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,045
Zoe?

568
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,761
Frank?

569
00:50:07,877 --> 00:50:09,693
Zoe?

570
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:16,865
Frank! Zoe, can you hear me?

571
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,048
I should not be here.

572
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,371
Hi. Do you know... where we are?

573
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,001
What have you got there? I...
What do you have in your hand?

574
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,690
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

575
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,651
Eva.

576
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:22,246
Eva!

577
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,605
- Need some help...
- Hey.

578
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,928
Hey, look at me.
Look at me. You're OK, you're OK.

579
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,121
What happened? Tell me what happened.

580
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,360
I was... I was somewhere else.

581
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:39,567
I was in this building, a hallway,
and I saw this girl.

582
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,890
And the building was on fire and...

583
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,327
there were these people in an apartment,
and they couldn't get out, and...

584
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,802
I could see their fingers
underneath the door.

585
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,403
What's that on your arm?

586
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,806
Holy... This is...

587
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,207
That's where it grabbed me! Oh!

588
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,522
What... What grabbed you?

589
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,802
- I don't know.
- Frank?

590
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,009
You wanna tell us what's going on here?

591
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,766
- Frank! What the hell's going on, man?
- I... You...

592
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,604
She told you, right?
Obviously she told you.

593
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,250
- What?
- She told you.

594
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,727
- No.
- What? Told her what?

595
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,121
Look, when Zoe was a little girl,

596
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,971
the apartment building she lived in
caught on fire

597
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,726
and her neighbors
got trapped behind a door.

598
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,041
She still has nightmares about it.

599
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,770
That sound like what you saw?

600
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,570
Yeah.

601
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,291
How's that even possible?
How's that possible, Frank?

602
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:51,447
Zoe said... after you die,
your body creates... like a compound,

603
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,524
- and it helps your soul move on or...
- DMT.

604
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,721
Right.

605
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,689
She said it opens a door
to somewhere else.

606
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,004
What... What if the door didn't open?

607
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,811
What if Zoe's soul couldn't get through?

608
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,731
What if she's trapped
in her own nightmare?

609
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,484
This is bullshit. You're lying.

610
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,566
- Lying?
- Frank...

611
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,848
Frank, I'm not lying! I'm not lying!

612
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,480
Hey. We can't deal with this
by ourselves.

613
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,768
We have no idea
what's going on in there!

614
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,763
- Did you see her arm?
- Yes, I saw it! OK?

615
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,246
What do you want me to do?

616
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,643
Look... if we screw this up,
we're gonna lose Zoe.

617
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,889
Help me. Please.

618
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,328
- Asshole.
- Dude.

619
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,609
All right, rest 24 hours,
take an Advil, and call me.

620
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,605
You good?

621
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,602
It was like I was there.

622
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,401
How is that even possible?

623
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,445
I'm telling you, it's the serum.

624
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,570
It's... It's like...
unlocking the part of the brain

625
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,643
that lets you do crazy psychic shit.

626
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,686
That's your big theory?
"Crazy psychic shit"?

627
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,526
There's a reason why evolution
happens really slowly.

628
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,009
And right now, her brain is doing things
a human brain was never designed to do.

629
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,529
And it's not taking millions of years,
it's taking minutes.

630
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,329
Hail Mary, full of grace...

631
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,925
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray...

632
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,691
Frank, you're gonna want to see this.

633
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,886
- What am I looking at here?
- I logged in as an admin

634
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,646
so I could scrub through
the security footage, and I found this.

635
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,366
It's a dummy account. Every day
it downloads everything in our system

636
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,090
- and makes a copy of it.
- So?

637
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,244
Someone's been watching us for...
like, months now.

638
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,765
All right, maybe it's the school.

639
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,843
The school doesn't need
to hack into our system. It...

640
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,647
It's gotta be Crylonis.

641
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,849
When was that last updated?

642
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,491
- Twenty minutes ago.
- Means they know we're here already.

643
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,881
If they don't, they will very soon.

644
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,122
We need to leave now.
Get the dog, gather everything.

645
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,970
- Can you take care of that?
- Where's the dog?

646
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,685
- I put him in his cage.
- Not in the cage.

647
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,444
All right. Everybody,
drop what you're doing,

648
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,125
find the dog, get your stuff together.

649
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,362
- Niko, handle that. We're leaving!
- OK.

650
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,165
Zoe?

651
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,490
Zoe?

652
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,682
- Niko.
- Jesus, what're you doing in here?

653
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,609
- I need your help.
- We gotta get you back.

654
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,770
I need your help.
You have to make me feel normal.

655
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,924
- OK, wait. OK, what... Are you OK?
- You have to make me feel normal.

656
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,082
- I need it. Please.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just...

657
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,447
You just went through something
very traumatic, OK?

658
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,291
- I think you may be confused...
- You don't understand.

659
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,724
Niko, you are the only one
I can trust. OK?

660
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,651
Help me.

661
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,171
No! No! No, stop.

662
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,244
- I thought you were my friend.
- I am your friend.

663
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,721
But you're not being yourself right now.
We still don't understand...

664
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,723
"...what's happening to you."

665
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,844
I spent my whole life
trying to make up for one mistake.

666
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,091
I did everything right.

667
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,368
And I still ended up in hell.

668
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,247
Zoe, we can help you.
Frank said we can fix this.

669
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,404
- We just need more time.
- Oh, no.

670
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,289
It's too late for that.

671
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,082
You have no idea what you've done.

672
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,641
But you will.

673
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,326
Zoe, please!

674
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,921
Zoe?

675
00:58:39,121 --> 00:58:40,884
Zoe, please!

676
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,104
Zoe...

677
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,006
Hey.

678
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,202
- Everything OK in here?
- Yeah. Why, what's wrong?

679
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,523
- Hey, guys, where's Niko?
- He was gone when I got here.

680
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,281
- I think he went to the bathroom.
- I was just there a second ago.

681
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,761
- It's what he said.
- To hell with this.

682
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,490
- Wait. Wait, what?
- I'm calling security, man.

683
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,849
- Hey, wait. Think about this.
- This is too much weird shit!

684
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,083
OK? I'm done! They can arrest me,
whatever, I don't care. I'm done!

685
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,285
You've wasted three years of my life
because you can't read a contract.

686
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,249
You're not my boss
and you're not my friend.

687
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,925
- Now get out of my way.
- You want me to apologize?

688
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,929
Fine, I'll apologize, OK?

689
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,885
You know what's gonna happen if
they find out what's going on in here?

690
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,084
They're gonna put her in a lab and
they're gonna cut her up into pieces,

691
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,323
- and we're never gonna see her again.
- You don't know that.

692
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,323
It's what I would do.

693
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,008
Sorry. No, no. Get out of my way.

694
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,891
- Jesus.
- What the hell! Are you kiddin' me?

695
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,202
It's fine, it's a blackout. It's fine.

696
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,125
It's fine! It's all fine, Frank!

697
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,250
Hey... does this happen often?

698
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,568
You know how many emergency systems
are in this place?

699
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,770
The phones don't go dead.
It doesn't happen.

700
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,207
- There's no way.
- Come on, let's go.

701
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,282
Everything's fried.
Don't bother with that.

702
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,649
- It's stuck.
- Let me try, let me try. Let me try!

703
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,649
It's stuck.
Here, help me with the elevator.

704
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,848
Damn it!

705
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,208
There's gotta be another way out.

706
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,565
Right?

707
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,565
- Where are you going?
- To find Niko.

708
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,767
You're not wrong, you know.

709
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,284
You're thinking, "I don't belong here.
I never belonged here."

710
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,647
It's OK to think that. You're right.

711
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,647
You're not one of us. You never were.

712
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,928
Some people are destined
for great things,

713
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,401
and other people just hold the camera.

714
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,841
All right, the system's
on lock-down mode.

715
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,002
- Meaning what?
- It's automated.

716
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,162
If it thinks there's any danger
of a contaminant escaping,

717
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,840
- the whole place just shuts down.
- What about the elevator?

718
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,128
We tried it. Gonna have
to figure something else out.

719
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,567
What did you do?

720
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,007
Zoe, what did you do?

721
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,004
What are you talking about? I've been
in here with you the entire time.

722
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,845
No, you were also
the last person who saw Niko!

723
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,243
No! No, all this weird shit started
happening as soon as she came back!

724
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,609
You guys said it yourselves,
the serum did something to her brain!

725
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,730
This is not the time to talk.

726
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,326
No, this is the exact time
to talk about it!

727
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,970
I wanna know what happened to Niko.

728
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,282
Jesus, can we all just relax
and find a way out of here, please?

729
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,131
I wanna know what happened to Niko, now!

730
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,570
Clay.

731
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,164
- Clay.
- Clay. Clay?

732
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,481
- Jesus, is he choking?
- Clay?

733
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:23,087
- Frank! Frank! Frank, he's choking!
- There's an obstruction!

734
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,641
Give me the forceps!
I need the forceps, right under there!

735
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,007
Hurry up! I need a light! Clay! Clay!

736
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:29,969
Stay with me, Clay. Clay!

737
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,169
Give me the forceps! Let me see!
I need a light! Clay!

738
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,482
- Now! Bring it here now!
- OK!

739
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,843
- Clay...
- Help me hold him still.

740
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,843
Clay! Clay! Clay! Clay! Jesus!

741
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,002
Clay, stay with me!
Stay with me! Help me hold him still.

742
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,563
- Clay! Do you need the light?
- Jesus, what the hell is it?

743
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,609
Shine the light in there!
Get the light in there!

744
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,761
- Clay!
- Oh, Jesus.

745
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,481
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- Frank!

746
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,091
Oh, my...

747
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,870
- Come here.
- Oh, my God! Where is she?

748
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,926
- Jesus!
- Frank! She's gone! Frank, she's gone!

749
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,401
Where'd she go? Zoe? Zoe?

750
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,644
Here, stay close.
Stay close. Stay close.

751
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,082
- Zoe?
- Zoe!

752
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,205
Stay close.

753
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,385
Zoe, stop!

754
01:04:07,953 --> 01:04:09,872
Oh, my God.

755
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,369
Oh, my God. Eva.

756
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,525
- Eva, wake up. Eva, you OK? Come here.
- Oh...

757
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,729
Come here. Get up. Gotta get up. Get up.

758
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,689
Frank...

759
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,487
We need a weapon
or something we can use.

760
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,885
Hold this.

761
01:04:38,955 --> 01:04:40,128
Frank?

762
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,689
Frank... she killed him. She killed him!

763
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,995
I know. I know. Listen to me.

764
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,971
Frank? Frank, what is that?

765
01:05:16,585 --> 01:05:18,123
Oh, my God! Frank!

766
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,161
Frank, they're coming! They're coming!
They're alive!

767
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,608
Listen to me! Listen to me!
They're not alive, OK? Come here.

768
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,683
This is called Embutramide.

769
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,491
We use it to put down lab animals.
You need a full dose.

770
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,971
Listen to me. I need you to hide
until I'm done with it.

771
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,168
- I am not leaving you. I am... No!
- Shh.

772
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,842
Hey, this is my fault. I'm gonna fix it.

773
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,641
But if I can't,
I need you to promise me...

774
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,402
you do not let her leave
this laboratory, no matter what.

775
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,131
We cannot let her hurt anybody else,
you understand me?

776
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,762
- Do you understand me?
- I promise, I promise, I promise.

777
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,167
OK. I'm sorry.

778
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,004
Please... Frank, please
don't leave me alone!

779
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,189
Frank, please don't leave me alone!
Frank, please!

780
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,401
Zoe?

781
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:36,407
It's Frank. I'm not gonna hurt you.

782
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,608
I just wanna talk.

783
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:46,365
It's OK.
I just wanna talk to you, that's all.

784
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,044
Then why do you have that syringe?

785
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,841
OK. All right.

786
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:05,444
Look, I know you're probably
really scared... and confused.

787
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:10,049
This is not your fault, OK?
I did this. This is my fault.

788
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,084
I'm so sorry, sweetie, OK?

789
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,767
We're gonna fix this.
We can fix this together, OK?

790
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,440
We can do anything, you hear me?

791
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,206
It's you and me. I'm right here.

792
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,409
I'm not gonna hurt you. OK?

793
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,891
Look at me.

794
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,963
I'm with you.

795
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,991
Do you still love me?

796
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,829
Yes, of course I do.

797
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,682
Then show me.

798
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,330
This is not the Zoe I know.

799
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,926
- Zoe?
- You've gotta stop her.

800
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,651
You get that needle and put her down.

801
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,606
That's what I thought.

802
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:56,647
Zoe!

803
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,969
Eva!

804
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,611
Eva...

805
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,561
Zoe?

806
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,910
Eva!

807
01:10:33,759 --> 01:10:35,807
Eva.

808
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,302
Zoe?

809
01:11:45,846 --> 01:11:47,563
Zoe, I know you're here!

810
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,763
Zoe?

811
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,641
- Zoe, please!
- Hail Mary, full of grace.

812
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,370
Our Lord is with thee.

813
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,801
Pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death.

814
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,601
Zoe?

815
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,205
It's her dream.

816
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,567
Zoe! Zoe!

817
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,446
Zoe, it's OK, it's me.

818
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,170
You did this.

819
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,329
You started the fire.

820
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,086
Hey, listen to me.
This is not your fault.

821
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,691
This wasn't your fault.

822
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,807
You can stop this, OK?

823
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,201
You can open the door.

824
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,768
Zoe, open the door!

825
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,690
I'm sorry.

826
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,165
I'm so sorry.

827
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,408
- Hey, are you OK?
- She killed them!

828
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,321
