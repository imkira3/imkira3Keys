00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,939
I wrote it all down:
4,222 square feet, four floors. Perfect.

3
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,733
Courtyard in back,
south-facing garden. Perfect.

4
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,320
-Shouldn't we wait for the car service?
-No, we'll sit in traffic forever.

5
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,906
-ls that the listing sheet?
-There isn't one.

6
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,701
I heard about it this morning.
lt'll be gone soon.

7
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,870
-How many more?
-None. You know the market is tight.

8
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,958
-Sarah, do you have to ride that here?
-Mom, we're in the street.

9
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,836
Evan!

10
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,175
One day you will learn
to respect people's time, Lydia.

11
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:18,805
You'll realize that the world does not stop
and start at your convenience.

12
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,181
l'm so sorry.

13
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,143
l'm meeting Arthur Digby Laurence
in 26 minutes...

14
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,855
...and if you think he's the kind of man
who tolerates tardiness...

15
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,857
...you are sadly mistaken.

16
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,401
You're a saint to wait for us.

17
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,361
-Thank you.
-Hello.

18
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:39,534
lt's kind of between a townhouse
and a brownstone.

19
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,078
We call it a "townstone."

20
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,916
Built in 1879, this is the middle
of the house, the parlor floor.

21
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,212
Here is the living room.
Formal dining is in the back.

22
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,007
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...

23
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:58,136
...which was renovated in '94
with all the expected amenities.

24
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,637
Sarah.

25
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,600
There are two bedroom floors above.

26
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,562
My God, it's amazing.

27
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,939
Hey, kid. No scooter.

28
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,570
l don't have to tell you this amount
of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.

29
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,992
lt's got a yard. Sort of.

30
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,621
lt is in a bit of disarray, but then again,
21-foot lot, 53 deep.

31
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,665
lt allows for an expansive garden.

32
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,834
Working elevator.

33
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,172
The previous owner was disabled
the last years of his life.

34
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,840
Highly unusual, the elevator.

35
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,343
You will not find this
in 90 percent of brownstones.

36
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,681
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper,
but we anticipate enormous interest.

37
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,017
lt's a very emotional property.

38
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,603
Shall we have a look at the rest?

39
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,651
You should make an offer immediately.

40
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,152
Can l see it first?

41
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,781
There is nothing like this
on the market right now.

42
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,367
You can't move from Greenwich
to the Upper West Side...

43
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:06,371
...and expect to still have a house, a yard
and a dog and cat, but here it is.

44
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,124
lt's got everything
you told me you wanted and more.

45
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,419
You'll have another family.
You could have two.

46
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,795
lt's a fortune.

47
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,132
Mom, it's not Barneys.
You don't have to pay the price on the tag.

48
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,305
He can afford it.

49
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,477
lt would be so lovely
if l could show the property before l leave.

50
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,154
Hardwood floors throughout,
as many as six working fireplaces.

51
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,699
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms.
One at either end.

52
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,743
They share one small bath.

53
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,620
Originally, this would have been
the servants' quarters.

54
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,331
The previous owner
kept a small nursing staff.

55
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,792
l don't know if you have live-in help.

56
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,670
No, it's just the two of us.

57
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,469
Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
or what have you.

58
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,055
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.

59
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,225
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine,
the financier.

60
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,062
May l ask what you do, Mrs....

61
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,938
Altman.

62
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,566
Actually, l'm going back to school.
Columbia.

63
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,736
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.

64
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,573
l didn't realize
you were Stephan Altman's wife.

65
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,451
Yes, until recently.

66
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,912
Master bath.

67
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,459
Pearlstine's been in all the papers
since he died.

68
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,128
His kids are suing each other
over the estate.

69
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,255
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.

70
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,508
Now they can't find half his money.

71
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,511
l hardly see how gossip
is germane to showing the property.

72
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,889
Stop calling it "the property."
lt sounds ridiculous.

73
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,266
Walk-in closet.

74
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,481
Could the little one please stop that?

75
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,192
Kid, no elevator!

76
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:03,071
And we emerge in the master suite.

77
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,789
That's strange.

78
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,040
What?

79
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,632
ls this room smaller than it should be?

80
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,801
You're the first person to notice.

81
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:29,597
On caravan, no one from our office
had the slightest idea.

82
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,445
lt's called a panic room.

83
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,280
-What?
-A safe room.

84
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,491
-A castle keep in medieval times.
-l've read about these.

85
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,827
They're in vogue in high-end construction.

86
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,580
One can't be too careful
about home invasion.

87
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,040
This is perfect.

88
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,375
The alarm goes off
in the middle of the night.

89
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,462
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?

90
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:04,215
Traipse downstairs in your underthings
to check it out? l think not.

91
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:08,386
Concrete walls. Buried phone line,
not connected to the house's main line.

92
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,223
Call the police, nobody can cut you off.
You have your own ventilation system.

93
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,519
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers
nearly every corner of the house.

94
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,813
This whole thing makes me nervous.

95
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,231
Why?

96
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,150
Ever read any Poe?

97
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,486
No, but l loved her last album.

98
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,990
What's to keep somebody
from prying open the door?

99
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,241
Steel.

100
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,952
Thick steel. Very thick steel.

101
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,622
Full battery backup,
so even if the power's out...

102
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,332
...it's still functional.

103
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,337
Oh, my god.
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?

104
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,546
Open it, please.

105
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:47,217
And with kids like he's apparently got,
no wonder he wanted a place to hide.

106
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,510
Please open the door.

107
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,178
That is highly inappropriate.

108
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,222
Open the door, please.

109
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,146
My room. Definitely my room.

110
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,856
This is really dangerous.

111
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,360
-That door is a hazard.
-Not at all.

112
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,865
Motion detector, like an elevator.

113
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,577
The door won't close if it's blocked.
There's another one at your ankles.

114
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,830
lt couldn't be safer.

115
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,472
l know they'll take asking price.

116
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,034
lt's working. l hooked up the phone!

117
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,078
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.

118
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,913
579 what?

119
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,082
3000.

120
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,590
patsy's pizza. pIease hoId.

121
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,014
Hey. Enough.

122
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,774
Mind the pizza?

123
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,275
What do you mean?

124
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,738
Our first night.
l should've thought of something special.

125
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,323
l like pizza.

126
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,590
Fuck him.

127
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,135
Don't.

128
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,430
Fuck her, too.

129
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,391
l agree.

130
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,185
But don't.

131
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,125
Don't you think this place
has way too many stairs?

132
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,043
You didn't carry anything up them.

133
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,629
You never asked
what l thought of this house.

134
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,840
l didn't want you to tell me you hated it.

135
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,260
-l liked our old house.
-Well, so did l.

136
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,721
You know what l was thinking?

137
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,474
l was thinking we could
stencil the whole bookcase.

138
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,436
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.

139
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,438
Go ahead.

140
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,945
Oh, damn.

141
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,240
l forgot to set up that tour
of your new school.

142
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,702
Dad already did it.
l'm going with him on Sunday.

143
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,203
Oh, yeah?

144
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,748
So l'll take a cab and meet him there.

145
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,918
ls that what he said?

146
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,838
lsn't that what's so great
about Manhattan?

147
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,049
You don't have to drive me everywhere?

148
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,551
l'll ride with you.

149
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,888
Why'd you bring me here
if l can't go anywhere on my own?

150
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,556
That's it. l quit.

151
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,477
l'm not fighting with you till tomorrow.

152
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,520
Come here.

153
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,191
lt's disgusting how much l love you.

154
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,942
Tell me about it.

155
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,451
-Mom?
-Yeah.

156
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,953
lt's too dark.

157
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,262
Better?

158
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,223
That's better.

159
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,124
"Bypass non-ready zone."

160
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,923
"Bypass non-ready zone."

161
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,759
"Shunt. Enter."

162
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,814
"Bypass non-ready zone."

163
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,482
"Shunt."

164
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,610
"Enter zone number."

165
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,114
"Shunt again."

166
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,290
ln the morning l got to figure out
how to turn this thing off.

167
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,909
Go, go back.

168
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,206
Do it.

169
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:16,883
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.

170
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,635
Amateur.

171
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,810
We got a problem! We need to talk!

172
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,521
lt's about time. l'm freezing
my tits off out there.

173
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,403
-Who is that?
-This is Raoul.

174
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:37,946
Who the fuck is Raoul?

175
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,907
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.

176
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,368
-Where'd you get him?
-Through some people.

177
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,120
Open the fucking door.

178
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,709
No shit.

179
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:56,798
What is this?

180
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:00,260
There's a girl on the top floor,
a woman on the third. They're asleep.

181
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,761
They're not supposed to be here.

182
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,098
-This is your department, Junior!
-They are not supposed to be here!

183
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,142
Videotape. We're on videotape.

184
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,229
We've been on videotape since we got here
and the tapes are upstairs.

185
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,856
-14-day escrow.
-You fucked me!

186
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:16,985
14-day escrow! That's almost 3 weeks!
They should not be in for another week!

187
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,698
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?

188
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,534
Business days.
Escrow is always business days.

189
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,369
Five-day weeks always!

190
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,083
Right?

191
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,502
l'm out of here.

192
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,505
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!

193
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:40,842
We can handle this.
Can we still handle this?

194
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,178
lt's just a woman and a kid?

195
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,513
-Unless Daddy comes home.
-He's not.

196
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:49,517
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some
B model on the Upper East Side.

197
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,394
lt's just her and the kid!

198
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,438
Now, can we do this?

199
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,649
Yeah, we can do it.

200
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,736
Not with people here. And not with me.

201
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,202
-Wait! Twenty minutes!
-She'll call the police.

202
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,245
They'll be here before l unpack my bags.

203
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,374
So, we keep an eye on her.

204
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,086
Raoul can totally administrate that part.

205
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:20,215
l don't want Raoul to administrate that!
He's not even supposed to be here!

206
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,053
Nobody gets hurt.

207
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:28,890
What about us? What if she has a gun?

208
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,228
Who are you?

209
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,897
l'm Raoul.

210
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,414
You know we can't do this without you!

211
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,290
This is still a good plan.

212
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:58,628
Fuck that! This is a great plan.
lt's just got a slight twist.

213
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,046
Yeah.

214
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,257
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.

215
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:07,178
You make a lot of promises, don't you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.

216
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,264
No family.

217
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:14,102
You're right. lt's all fucked up.
l fucked it up!

218
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,271
lt's not how it's supposed to be.

219
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:24,821
But the fact of the matter is
there's still $3,000,000 in this house...

220
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:29,075
...and no one but you and l
even knows it's here.

221
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,246
Hey, l want that money. l want it!

222
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:34,998
But you...

223
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,418
...you need that money.

224
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:42,464
Or have you forgotten why you're here?

225
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,637
So let's quit dicking around, okay,
and get this over with.

226
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,812
Kill the phones.

227
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:41,184
Top floor, little girl. l've got the mother.
Give me that!

228
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:44,938
You stay here! Nobody gets past!

229
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:57,158
Wake up! Sarah!

230
00:26:58,910 --> 00:26:59,828
Get up!

231
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,711
What did you do that for?

232
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,053
Where are you going?

233
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:29,649
-What's going on?
-People. ln the house.

234
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,571
They're in the elevator, heading down.

235
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:54,924
Fuck! They're coming down to you!

236
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,510
l told you. l don't hurt people.

237
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,890
They're going downstairs.

238
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:05,560
-That room.
-What?

239
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,145
The panic room.

240
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,814
No, press emergency stop.

241
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:15,487
Fuck!

242
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,492
Coming back up!

243
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,088
That's you.

244
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:37,425
Shit.

245
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:46,976
Go!

246
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,270
Fuck!

247
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:52,941
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

248
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:55,944
Damn it! Mother--

249
00:28:58,697 --> 00:28:59,906
Shit!

250
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,211
That's seven years bad luck.

251
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:16,506
Shit.

252
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,148
Tell me they're not in there.

253
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,294
Oh, damn.

254
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,964
-lt doesn't work?
-lt's a different phone line.

255
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,925
l never hooked it up.

256
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,098
Now what?

257
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,543
l can't hear a thing.

258
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:38,254
What do you think they want?

259
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:40,215
l don't know. Rob us....

260
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,511
l don't know.

261
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,179
What do we do?

262
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,348
We wait.

263
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:51,309
-What if they get in here?
-Well, they can't.

264
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:55,188
They can't get in. lt's not possible.

265
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:56,898
Mom. l heard you.

266
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,029
-Do you feel okay?
-Yeah.

267
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:04,572
-You shaky?
-No.

268
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,116
-Chills?
-No.

269
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,913
Please. Don't worry about me.

270
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,850
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?

271
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:34,769
Hang out while the cops waltz in?
Use your head.

272
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,187
Here he comes.

273
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:39,274
l locked the roof access.
She's not getting down from there.

274
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,318
-Good.
-She could be in there calling the cops.

275
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:44,612
Could she have hooked it up today?

276
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:46,823
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.

277
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:50,035
She would've had to do it through
Manhattan Security, my company.

278
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:52,787
l checked the paperwork
and the phone is not connected.

279
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,914
You see? She couldn't have.

280
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:58,960
-l thought she wouldn't be here.
-He said she wouldn't.

281
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:01,963
Fuck you! And fuck you!
She is not supposed--

282
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:08,678
Do it.

283
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,308
Excuse me.

284
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,645
The poIice are on their way.

285
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,366
-She's lying.
-You're full of--

286
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,580
lt's not an intercom. lt's a PA system.

287
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:38,375
l know. l'm just scaring her.

288
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,919
I suggest you Ieave before they get here.

289
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,593
-What?
-He's saying that we don't have a phone.

290
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,136
How could he know that?

291
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,848
Take what you want and get outI

292
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,893
lf only it were that easy.

293
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,232
Some paper. l need some paper.
Give me some paper.

294
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,359
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?

295
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:05,985
You got a piece of paper?

296
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,867
-What is he doing?
-l don't know.

297
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,424
"What we want is in that room"?

298
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:29,676
They're coming in here, aren't they?

299
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,303
No, no. l told you. They can't get in here.

300
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,724
What do you know about this room?

301
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,559
What do we know about that room?

302
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:40,061
-Let's not tell her anything.
-Just a few details.

303
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,496
We're not coming out,
and we're not letting you in!

304
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:00,540
Get out of my houseI

305
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,917
-Say "fuck."
-You fuck.

306
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:07,881
-Mom.
-What?

307
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,924
"Get the fuck out of my house."

308
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:12,177
Get the fuck out of my houseI

309
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,185
Okay, l have an idea.

310
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:23,104
She's a woman. Women need security.

311
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,152
She won't believe you.

312
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:34,199
She needs to know she's dealing
with decent people and she can trust us.

313
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:42,957
Conversation's overI

314
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,546
What? She's not coming down?

315
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:52,133
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?

316
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:54,386
Like that'll help you think.

317
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:56,846
You know what? Fine! You think!

318
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:59,099
-What if she did call the cops?
-She didn't.

319
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,309
She said it again, that she called the cops.

320
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,895
lf cops were coming,
do you think l'd still be here?

321
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,773
Okay, fine. Good, excellent.
We all believe you.

322
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,150
How do we get into that room?

323
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,534
What is funny about this?

324
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,286
ls this shit funny to you?

325
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:23,707
l spent the last 12 years
building these rooms...

326
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:26,042
...to keep out people like us.

327
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:31,006
lt's all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?

328
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:33,842
We can't.

329
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:36,594
You can't get in the panic room.

330
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,348
That's the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.

331
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:42,642
And why would she do that?

332
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:44,811
l don't know.

333
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:49,024
But when she does,
she can't get out of this house.

334
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:53,403
We keep her here,
we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...

335
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:56,656
...and l don't want any help
from Joe Pesci over here.

336
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:00,035
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.

337
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,620
We make it impossible for them to leave.

338
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:08,209
And why would they come out
in the first place?

339
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:12,255
l'm working on that.

340
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,640
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

341
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:27,145
Small space?

342
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,147
l'm okay.

343
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:32,192
-You can't wig out.
-l know.

344
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:34,027
-l mean it.
-l won't.

345
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,991
You know,
people never get buried alive anymore.

346
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:44,079
l guess it used to happen all the time.

347
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,373
Really?

348
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,041
Yeah, l read that.

349
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,586
And when did this happen all the time?

350
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,174
Twenty, thirty years ago.

351
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:01,137
What are they doing now?

352
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:09,187
l don't know.

353
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:11,499
They're locking us in.

354
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:52,624
This is not happening.

355
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:04,678
Sarah, calm down.

356
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:10,183
You know what could happen
if you let yourself get worked up.

357
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:12,644
Sarah!

358
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:45,635
-What the hell are you doing?
-We're coming in from below.

359
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:49,264
No, you're not. Even if you got through
the concrete, there's steel.

360
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:51,099
You won't even make a dent.

361
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,268
We'll see.

362
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:56,771
Hey. This is what l do.

363
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:59,899
lf some idiot with a sledgehammer
could break in...

364
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:03,111
...do you really think
that l would still have a job?

365
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:13,872
Don't get that in your eye.

366
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:49,491
Neighbor.

367
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:50,950
Help!

368
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:53,370
Please help us!

369
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:55,955
-Call the police!
-Do you hear us?

370
00:40:56,414 --> 00:40:57,457
Help us!

371
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:10,345
Help!

372
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:13,515
-Help us, please!
-Call the police!

373
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:58,810
Shit!

374
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:28,089
You guys just going to stand there?

375
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:30,884
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?

376
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:08,338
He can't get in here with a hammer,
can he?

377
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:17,013
Could you be any louder?

378
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:29,359
Give me a hand with those boxes.

379
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:33,029
Listen, goddamn it!

380
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:36,700
l'm in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?

381
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:46,001
-They're going to get in here.
-No, they can't get in here.

382
00:43:49,629 --> 00:43:52,382
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.

383
00:44:58,698 --> 00:45:00,075
Oh, this is good.

384
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:03,244
This could work.

385
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:06,706
l was just thinking
that we should do something like this.

386
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:13,755
-Open it.
-l just did.

387
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,715
Open it some more.

388
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:19,719
We're just sending them a message.

389
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:22,472
They'll get the point.

390
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:02,137
Honey, get down on the ground.

391
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:14,149
Quit dicking around
and open this fucking thing up.

392
00:46:14,232 --> 00:46:16,359
-Don't be stupid.
-Quiet!

393
00:46:16,484 --> 00:46:19,070
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.

394
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:27,579
What is it?

395
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:29,330
lt's bad.

396
00:46:31,499 --> 00:46:32,959
They're coughing.

397
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:35,587
lf they're coughing, they're going to die!

398
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:37,339
Nobody is going to die, man!

399
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:40,759
Will you please have the balls
to follow through with something?

400
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:57,233
Mom.

401
00:47:01,654 --> 00:47:05,200
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out.
They'll have a hangover.

402
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:08,495
How are we going to get in there
if they pass out, Junior?

403
00:47:11,122 --> 00:47:12,374
Cut it back a little.

404
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:15,460
They won't pass out, numb-nuts.
They'll throw up first.

405
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:17,629
We can't get in if they're dead!

406
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:22,175
Stay on the ground and breathe.

407
00:47:29,015 --> 00:47:30,475
Turn it down.

408
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:32,686
Turn it down! lt's too much!

409
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:35,355
-Don't you start up with this shit.
-Keep it down!

410
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:47,742
l'm turning it down.

411
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:50,328
-Keep his ass off of me.
-We're not killing anybody.

412
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:03,925
-Tell him to turn it down!
-Turn the shit off.

413
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:06,261
-No.
-Turn it down.

414
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:19,983
-Mom?
-Just a second.

415
00:48:24,529 --> 00:48:25,739
Get under this.

416
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,575
Oh, my god.

417
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:31,494
-Fucking amateurs, man!
-lt's my fucking idea.

418
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:45,008
Shut the fuck up!
There are people trying to sleep over there.

419
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:10,909
What is that?

420
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:13,912
Turn the gas off.

421
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:24,964
Turn the gas off right now.

422
00:49:48,613 --> 00:49:49,948
Get back!

423
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:51,741
Shit!

424
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:55,995
God!

425
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:57,414
Get it off me!

426
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:05,046
lt's okay.

427
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:12,387
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
l'm coming in there!

428
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:15,557
Calm the fuck down.

429
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:27,694
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

430
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:33,742
Promise me you'll never do
anything like that.

431
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:35,952
l won't.

432
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:42,334
They're moving.
At least they're still moving in there.

433
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:55,764
What?

434
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:57,766
Talk to him.

435
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:03,229
Please, man, give it a rest.

436
00:52:04,457 --> 00:52:06,668
-That Morse code?
-SOS.

437
00:52:06,918 --> 00:52:08,503
Where'd you learn that?

438
00:52:08,753 --> 00:52:10,046
Titanic.

439
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,518
We got to talk. Downstairs.

440
00:52:29,649 --> 00:52:32,027
No, no, no. Not you.

441
00:52:38,533 --> 00:52:41,995
Come on, come on, come on.

442
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:44,581
Get up.

443
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,042
Come on.

444
00:52:56,217 --> 00:52:57,552
Wake up.

445
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:06,895
The first thing l'm going to do this morning
is call my plastic surgeon.

446
00:53:06,978 --> 00:53:11,983
There's been a change here.
$100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.

447
00:53:13,276 --> 00:53:16,196
l want a third
of whatever's in that room up there.

448
00:53:20,408 --> 00:53:21,368
Fine!

449
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:25,789
Okay? Full share, one-third.
Congratulations.

450
00:53:26,414 --> 00:53:30,585
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000.
Your parents will be proud.

451
00:53:52,982 --> 00:53:54,234
Got him.

452
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:58,697
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.

453
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:01,282
l'm not losing
my half of the money because--

454
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:02,867
Slow down. Half?

455
00:54:02,992 --> 00:54:06,413
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third....

456
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:08,623
Come on.

457
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:15,964
l'm letting you know he's a problem.

458
00:54:16,214 --> 00:54:18,967
But this wasn't my idea,
so he's your problem.

459
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:21,386
You're right. lt wasn't your idea!

460
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:23,638
None of this was your idea!
lt was my idea!

461
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:28,893
Come on, look over here.

462
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:42,532
Yes.

463
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:44,701
Yes, yes, yes.

464
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:50,665
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.

465
00:54:56,921 --> 00:54:58,673
-We're here!
-Help us!

466
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:00,550
We're over here!

467
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:12,270
Help!

468
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:14,564
Open your window!

469
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:15,982
Help!

470
00:55:24,532 --> 00:55:26,826
We're never going to get out of here.

471
00:55:35,293 --> 00:55:38,546
l'm the loving grandson who put in
the time with the old man...

472
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:41,049
...every goddamn weekend for two years...

473
00:55:41,257 --> 00:55:44,260
...talking to him, dressing him,
walking him, feeding him.

474
00:55:44,427 --> 00:55:45,845
Are you done?

475
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:49,224
No. l'm the one the old man
finally told about the safe.

476
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:53,186
l'm the one who found the guy who built it,
and l convinced him to break into it!

477
00:55:56,898 --> 00:55:58,149
Wait a minute.

478
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:04,531
-What?
-The bedroom's empty. Where are they?

479
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:08,493
Two of them, on the stairs.

480
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:10,829
Where's the third guy?

481
00:56:14,874 --> 00:56:16,876
l left my cell phone by the bed.

482
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:22,882
l earned that money.

483
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:25,677
l will not let you jeopardize
my fucking plan...

484
00:56:25,844 --> 00:56:29,097
...because you have a problem
relating to others!

485
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:31,933
Got it?

486
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:35,437
lf l don't come back, close this door.

487
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,313
Just do what l say.

488
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:41,568
He touches me again, l'll shoot him.

489
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:42,694
Christ!

490
00:56:45,196 --> 00:56:46,364
Wait!

491
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:53,204
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle,
or can we get back to work?

492
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:55,623
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.

493
00:56:55,832 --> 00:56:58,668
l'll shove it up your ass and snap it off.

494
00:56:58,793 --> 00:57:02,172
You're a bus driver, Raoul.

495
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:03,965
You live in Flatbush.

496
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,926
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard
bullshit you just heard...

497
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:08,970
...because l saw that movie, too.

498
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:10,388
What is this?

499
00:57:12,682 --> 00:57:14,100
l got some news for you.

500
00:57:16,394 --> 00:57:17,771
Go.

501
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:19,439
Go!

502
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,257
Fuck!

503
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:13,928
She got something. What did she get?

504
00:59:15,096 --> 00:59:16,014
No.

505
00:59:18,183 --> 00:59:19,351
Charger!

506
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:22,228
She has a cell phone.

507
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:24,731
No!

508
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:28,026
All right, signal.

509
00:59:28,276 --> 00:59:30,945
Come on. Signal.

510
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:45,919
l don't think they'll be talking
on no cell phone from in there.

511
00:59:47,003 --> 00:59:49,631
-Why not?
-You can't call out from in there.

512
00:59:52,592 --> 00:59:54,094
No signal.

513
01:00:03,728 --> 01:00:06,481
l didn't hook up this line,
but l hooked up the main line.

514
01:00:06,606 --> 01:00:09,109
lf we can find it, we can cut into it.

515
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:15,907
l can't go to prison, man.
l'm not built for that shit.

516
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:28,211
Be careful.

517
01:00:39,764 --> 01:00:41,016
Get the phone.

518
01:00:41,224 --> 01:00:43,309
-lt doesn't come off.
-Rip it off!

519
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:57,032
Screwdriver. Phillips.

520
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:08,752
Junior, when l asked you to cut
the phone lines, did you cut the main line?

521
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:12,339
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone
in the kitchen?

522
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:39,240
Shit!

523
01:01:42,285 --> 01:01:44,412
Strip this and expose the wires.

524
01:01:44,537 --> 01:01:46,748
-What are we doing?
-l have no idea.

525
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:17,445
-Okay, got it?
-Yeah. Here.

526
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:18,780
Okay.

527
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,865
Yellow, yellow.

528
01:02:35,255 --> 01:02:36,172
Okay.

529
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,801
Dial tone.

530
01:02:48,893 --> 01:02:50,145
911 emergency.

531
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:53,064
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street--

532
01:02:53,189 --> 01:02:56,359
-pIease hoId.
-No, no. God.

533
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:02,949
Call Dad.

534
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,875
How do you live in New York
and not have a single Percocet?

535
01:03:14,252 --> 01:03:17,380
-HeIIo?
-Stephan. Put Stephan on the line.

536
01:03:17,505 --> 01:03:19,341
-Who is this?
-lt's Meg.

537
01:03:20,216 --> 01:03:21,843
Do you know what time it is?

538
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:25,513
-Put him on the phone, bitch.
-It's your fucking wife.

539
01:03:29,517 --> 01:03:30,477
Move.

540
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:34,981
-HeIIo?
-You've got to help us.

541
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:36,024
Move!

542
01:03:36,274 --> 01:03:39,527
There are three men upstairs.
They broke in--

543
01:03:42,947 --> 01:03:43,865
What--

544
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:00,965
-He'll do something.
-No, he won't.

545
01:04:01,091 --> 01:04:02,592
He'll call the police.

546
01:04:02,842 --> 01:04:04,886
You don't know her. She won't let him.

547
01:04:05,178 --> 01:04:08,515
No. He knows that there's trouble.
He heard me.

548
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:12,686
He's across the park. That's why
we got houses close to each other.

549
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:15,230
Just in case we needed each other.
He'll help us.

550
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:17,607
-He won't.
-Yes, he will!

551
01:04:23,613 --> 01:04:24,906
l'm sorry.

552
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,325
No, l'm sorry.

553
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:29,494
Why?

554
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:32,872
l was trying not to tell you.

555
01:04:34,124 --> 01:04:35,083
What?

556
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:37,711
l'm dizzy and hungry.

557
01:04:41,006 --> 01:04:44,217
All she's got is NyQuil and fucking Midol.

558
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,139
Looks like that gas idea
didn't work so well.

559
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:51,266
Whose fault was that?

560
01:04:51,474 --> 01:04:52,767
This is impossible.

561
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:54,644
What's the plan now, hot rod?

562
01:04:54,769 --> 01:04:57,439
This is worse than impossible.
This is unpleasant.

563
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:02,318
Here, drink this.
All right, drink lots of water.

564
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:06,406
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood-sugar up.

565
01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:07,991
Can you hear me okay?

566
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:09,868
l'm just dizzy, not deaf.

567
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:13,038
Great. Smart ass. That's excellent.

568
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:17,417
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?

569
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:19,210
Let's check it again.

570
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:20,712
Mom, l did it.

571
01:05:21,087 --> 01:05:22,964
We got to stay calm, okay?

572
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:26,259
lf we stay calm, everything will be fine.
All right? Stay calm.

573
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:27,886
You're making me nervous.

574
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:29,763
l'm sorry.

575
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:32,932
What if l keep dropping?

576
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:37,062
You won't. l'll figure something out.

577
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:41,358
You know, he's right.

578
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:44,569
There's no way
we're getting into that room.

579
01:05:44,694 --> 01:05:46,237
What are you talking about?

580
01:05:47,697 --> 01:05:50,492
l just got to be honest with myself here.

581
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:52,911
l don't need to be involved...

582
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:56,831
...with anything so harrowing
or perilous at this point in my life.

583
01:05:56,915 --> 01:05:59,793
-You're giving up?
-Hell, yes.

584
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:03,672
l don't need the fucking aggravation.
l'll make an anonymous phone call.

585
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:07,926
They'll find the floor safe. l'll inherit.

586
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,845
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.

587
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:14,474
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.

588
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:18,770
Fuck, l'll still put away 8 or 900 grand
and keep my goddamn hair.

589
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:22,691
Take it. Go out and get loaded.

590
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:25,360
Wait a minute.

591
01:06:26,403 --> 01:06:28,530
Say what you just said again.

592
01:06:34,452 --> 01:06:37,205
Say that shit about the money
again, babycakes.

593
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:41,793
When? Before?

594
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:43,420
Yeah, before.

595
01:06:43,545 --> 01:06:47,215
Splitting the money in your head,
you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.

596
01:06:48,675 --> 01:06:50,260
What are you doing?

597
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:54,347
That was after tax, which makes it more
than a million and a half gross.

598
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:58,101
So now you're a tax attorney.

599
01:07:00,895 --> 01:07:04,024
-l'm out of here.
-Wait a minute.

600
01:07:04,357 --> 01:07:08,737
There's sugar in everything.
Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.

601
01:07:08,987 --> 01:07:10,405
Where else?

602
01:07:13,283 --> 01:07:14,993
Travel kit.

603
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:17,871
Plus, you named eight people
you got to split it with...

604
01:07:17,954 --> 01:07:20,498
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks
in the safe.

605
01:07:20,707 --> 01:07:23,835
A fuck-up like you has got to get less
than everybody else...

606
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,920
...so now l don't know what to think.

607
01:07:26,379 --> 01:07:28,882
You're adding up money
you'll never touch, buddy.

608
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:31,926
How much is in there?

609
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:35,555
Mouthwash.

610
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:37,390
Saccharin.

611
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:42,979
Hey, l'm talking to you. Answer me.

612
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,856
Fine. There's more.

613
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:48,693
And when were you going to tell us
this minor economic detail?

614
01:07:48,818 --> 01:07:51,196
lt doesn't matter now.
lt's totally fucking moot!

615
01:07:52,113 --> 01:07:55,158
-Why are we having this conversation?
-What were you thinking?

616
01:07:55,283 --> 01:07:57,702
How did you expect to get away with this?

617
01:07:57,827 --> 01:07:59,913
Did you think that l'd open that safe...

618
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:03,333
...and then me and Raoul would wait
while you picked out your share?

619
01:08:04,292 --> 01:08:06,127
What's the matter with you?

620
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:09,255
You got us into this mess,
and you were going to fuck us?

621
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:12,926
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.

622
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:15,804
Your eyes were huge
when l told you about the gig...

623
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:17,305
...so don't play innocent.

624
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:19,891
Things didn't work out.

625
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:22,936
Play past it.

626
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:30,151
Mints? Sugar-free.

627
01:08:30,193 --> 01:08:30,902
Mints? Sugar-free.

628
01:08:31,027 --> 01:08:34,531
l'm opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.

629
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:36,533
lt's looking doubtful there, big guy.

630
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:40,453
l will split the money with Raoul.
But l don't ever want to see you again.

631
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:44,290
Cops show up on my doorstep,
we will know who sent them...

632
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:46,626
...and we will fucking find you.

633
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:52,507
l'll see you, Burnham.

634
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,010
Later, Raoul.

635
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:02,475
Mom!

636
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:14,529
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street
a couple of times...

637
01:09:14,654 --> 01:09:16,823
...think you know all about it.

638
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:21,870
You don't know nothing about me.

Okay.

642
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:37,218
You should see the look on your face.

What's happening?

644
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,475
-Don't move. Don't you fucking move.

-Stop it, you fucking--

Clown? ldiot? Fucking asshole?

Me.

653
01:10:11,002 --> 01:10:12,253
That's right.

lt's burning me.

655
01:10:14,798 --> 01:10:16,049
Who's got the gun?

656
01:10:16,883 --> 01:10:17,801
You.

657
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:20,053
Remember that.

658
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:23,264
Find out who the fuck that is.

659
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:28,561
Give me your wallet.

660

Stephan Altman.

662
01:10:44,452 --> 01:10:47,247
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan?

663
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,418
What did she say?

664
01:10:54,462 --> 01:10:56,464
Don't know. Cut off.

665
01:10:56,673 --> 01:10:59,300
-Phones are dead.
-Did you call anybody else?

666
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:04,639
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?

667
01:11:08,309 --> 01:11:09,144
No.

668
01:11:09,728 --> 01:11:11,396
He's telling the truth.

669
01:11:12,939 --> 01:11:13,690
Yeah.

670
01:11:14,315 --> 01:11:15,567
Yeah, he probably is.

Because when l do this, people don't lie.

672

You're full of ideas.
You just got to squeeze one out.

676
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:31,291
You want me to just make something up?

677
01:11:31,624 --> 01:11:33,543
You've got till the count of three.

678
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:36,129
Then you end up like Junior over there.

01:11:38,965 --> 01:11:41,384
-One, squeeze.
-This is ridiculous.

680
01:11:41,509 --> 01:11:42,594
Two, squeeze.

681
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,304

682
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:45,555
-Three.
-Wait!

683
01:11:46,306 --> 01:11:47,390

01:11:59,194 --> 01:12:00,028
Maybe.

687
01:12:00,403 --> 01:12:03,615

You kill him, they'll never open that door.

703

Oh, god.

704

You'll be fine. Come on.

Get your hands off him,
you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!

01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:07,989
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

715
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:31,846

What are you doing?

728
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:07,854
We've got your kid.

You got to open the door.
My daughter is very sick.

746
01:19:57,547 --> 01:19:59,466
She needs an injection.

747
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:01,843
Do you hear me?

748
01:20:02,218 --> 01:20:04,512
Open the door so l can give her a shot.

Can you do this yourself?

755
01:20:43,718 --> 01:20:45,762
What happens if you don't get it?

756
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:48,556
Coma.

While we're in here, she'll call the cops.

775
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:43,296
Are you going to open the safe?

776
01:22:48,885 --> 01:22:50,679
Don't you look at me.

777
01:23:03,483 --> 01:23:05,902
All l know about this is what l see on TV.

Your mom's rich.

Dad's rich. Mom's just mad.

lt's not that l didn't try.

788
01:24:21,853 --> 01:24:25,523
Sometimes things, they don't work out
the way you want them to.

789
01:24:28,526 --> 01:24:30,487
Done.

790

Wasn't supposed to be like this.

791
01:24:35,408 --> 01:24:37,118
He had it all worked out.

792
01:24:37,744 --> 01:24:39,996
Nobody was supposed to even be here.

793
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:44,000
Thanks...

794
01:24:45,377 --> 01:24:46,419
...Burnham.

795

Wasn't supposed to be like this.

796
01:24:58,848 --> 01:25:00,392
She's going to be okay.

797
01:25:01,351 --> 01:25:03,728
I gave her the shot. She's aII right.

798
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:06,022

Stephan.

800
01:25:29,879 --> 01:25:31,464
Oh, my god.

Can you move?

802
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:40,682
Not much. l think my arm is broken.

803
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:02,328
Raise your arm.

804
01:26:03,038 --> 01:26:04,706
Come on, raise your arm.

805
01:26:22,891 --> 01:26:24,225
Try again.

806
01:26:24,934 --> 01:26:26,936
Come on. Try again.

807
01:26:29,022 --> 01:26:32,734
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.

808
01:26:35,445 --> 01:26:37,572
They're going to kill us.

809
01:26:37,697 --> 01:26:40,492
Just do everything they ask.
lt'll be okay that way.

810
01:26:40,784 --> 01:26:43,411
Stephan, they'll kill her.

811
01:26:57,133 --> 01:27:00,136
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.

812
01:27:00,387 --> 01:27:01,721
The police.

813
01:27:02,722 --> 01:27:04,099
You called the police?

814
01:27:04,182 --> 01:27:06,017
Of course, l called them.

815
01:27:06,601 --> 01:27:08,144
You scared the shit out of me.

816
01:27:08,269 --> 01:27:09,813
She killed the kid.

817
01:27:10,772 --> 01:27:13,066
She just killed her own kid.

818
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:15,568
All right, take this.

819
01:27:16,695 --> 01:27:18,238
Don't say a word.

820
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:25,412
No, her husband must have called them.

821
01:27:25,495 --> 01:27:28,289
Foreign son of a bitch. l told you!

822
01:27:29,499 --> 01:27:31,251
Where is she?

823
01:27:35,505 --> 01:27:36,464
There.

824
01:27:37,632 --> 01:27:39,300
What the fuck's she doing?

825
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:57,652
She's going to handle it.

826
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:03,783
l'm just trying to unlock....

827
01:28:10,081 --> 01:28:13,043
-ls everything okay?
-You all right, ma'am?

828
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:17,339
What are you.... What time is it?

829
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:20,717
lt's a little after 4:00 a.m.

830
01:28:21,176 --> 01:28:22,635
We got a call, ma'am.

831
01:28:23,887 --> 01:28:25,305
Somebody called you?

832
01:28:27,057 --> 01:28:28,350
Can we come in?

833
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:30,018
What do you want?

834
01:28:30,143 --> 01:28:33,313
-We'd like to come in.
-No, you can't come in.

835
01:28:33,813 --> 01:28:35,690
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?

836
01:28:36,483 --> 01:28:37,650
l'm fine.

837
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:40,904
Ma'am, you don't look so good.

838
01:28:49,287 --> 01:28:52,791
Well, you don't look so hot yourself,
Officer Keeney.

839
01:28:55,085 --> 01:28:57,003
Come on, l'm freezing out here.

840
01:28:59,923 --> 01:29:01,216
"There are three."

841
01:29:02,759 --> 01:29:03,593
What?

842
01:29:04,594 --> 01:29:06,971
Your husband said you called for help.

843
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:10,975
That you said, "There are three"
right before you got cut off.

844
01:29:14,604 --> 01:29:16,231
Oh, that phone call.

845
01:29:16,606 --> 01:29:18,692
And your neighbors...

846
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:23,571
...called in about some loud shouts
or a loudspeaker of some kind?

847
01:29:26,449 --> 01:29:28,368
That was the TV. lt's off now.

848
01:29:29,744 --> 01:29:33,331
Can l just ask you one question?

849
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:36,751
What was the end of that sentence?

850
01:29:39,713 --> 01:29:41,881
When you said, "There are three"...

851
01:29:43,133 --> 01:29:44,551
...what was the rest?

852
01:29:49,264 --> 01:29:50,181
Look....

853
01:29:53,977 --> 01:29:56,062
My husband and l just split up...

854
01:29:56,730 --> 01:30:00,108
...and it's my first night in a new house...

855
01:30:01,526 --> 01:30:03,695
...and l admit l was a little drunk.

856
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:08,450
And the sentence,
if you insist on knowing...

857
01:30:09,701 --> 01:30:11,161
...was going to be:

858
01:30:13,455 --> 01:30:18,126
"There are three things that l'll do for you
if you come jump into bed with me."

859
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:26,968
Thank God l came to my senses
before l said all that, and l hung up...

860
01:30:27,677 --> 01:30:30,764
...so nobody would ever have to know
what l was thinking.

861
01:30:30,847 --> 01:30:32,307
Unless, of course...

862
01:30:32,599 --> 01:30:36,895
...two policemen came in the middle
of the night and interrogated me.

863
01:30:41,274 --> 01:30:42,984
So, Rick, you want to go?

864
01:30:43,568 --> 01:30:46,363
Or do you want her to tell you
which three things?

865
01:30:50,784 --> 01:30:51,785
All right.

866
01:30:52,118 --> 01:30:53,119
Ma'am...

867
01:30:56,706 --> 01:30:59,417
...if there's something you want
to say to us...

868
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:04,172
...but maybe you can't say it right now...

869
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,678
...you might want to make some kind
of a signal...

870
01:31:10,011 --> 01:31:13,181
...by blinking your eyes a few times.

871
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:16,518
Something like that.

872
01:31:20,146 --> 01:31:23,692
That's something you could do safely.

873
01:31:33,535 --> 01:31:34,494
Man...

874
01:31:35,704 --> 01:31:37,747
...you guys are good.

875
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:43,169
You mean, like if there was somebody
in the house or something?

876
01:31:45,255 --> 01:31:47,674
They really train you guys.

877
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:54,097
No, l'm fine. l'm fine. Cross my heart.

878
01:32:03,773 --> 01:32:05,900
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

879
01:32:06,818 --> 01:32:08,069
'Night, ma'am.

880
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:23,793
This kid has seen my face.

881
01:32:24,377 --> 01:32:26,629
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.

882
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:29,799
Yeah, it is. You're here with me.

883
01:32:30,467 --> 01:32:32,052
You're on the hook, too.

884
01:32:32,969 --> 01:32:36,181
Do one. Same price for the rest.

885
01:32:39,309 --> 01:32:41,936
Stay the fuck away from me.

886
01:32:44,981 --> 01:32:46,941
You know how this is going to end.

887
01:34:03,018 --> 01:34:03,977
Goddamn!

888
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:41,973
What's up?

889
01:34:55,612 --> 01:34:57,530
Why the hell didn't we do that?

890
01:35:03,411 --> 01:35:06,831
What's she doing?
What the fuck does she think she's doing?

891
01:35:06,956 --> 01:35:10,877
She's got your gun.
Who told you to bring a gun?

892
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:15,465
Just let me drill, man.

893
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:01,237
Empty?

894
01:37:02,572 --> 01:37:03,782
Come on, man.

895
01:37:31,935 --> 01:37:33,603
Bank bonds.

896
01:37:35,772 --> 01:37:36,898
One second.

897
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,109
Two, three, four, five....

898
01:37:42,112 --> 01:37:43,697
Why are we doing this?

899
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,367
Because it's going to come to that.

900
01:37:50,453 --> 01:37:52,038
There are 22.

901

903

905
01:38:16,312 --> 01:38:19,816
Leave that. Christ, l'll buy you new tools.

906
01:38:23,695 --> 01:38:25,030
You'll be okay.

Watch the glass.

910
01:41:55,073 --> 01:41:56,241
Get down here.

911
01:41:58,368 --> 01:41:59,411
Wait.

912
01:42:00,203 --> 01:42:02,622
Wait. You don't want to do that.

913
01:42:02,789 --> 01:42:04,290
Dad, don't shoot him!

914
01:42:07,085 --> 01:42:08,503
Let my daughter go.

We're finished. Your daughter's fine.

916
01:42:13,049 --> 01:42:16,261
We'll go out the back door.
You'll never see us again.
