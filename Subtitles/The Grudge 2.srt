00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,520
You're gonna burn them.

3
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,230
You gonna go shopping for
three hours again today?

4
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,630
Leave your cellphone off?

5
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,140
You think I don't know what you're doing?
You think I'm stupid?

6
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:56,140
And yet you can't make
me a simple... damn breakfast.

7
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,600
Vanessa! Miyuki! Wait up!

8
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,110
Sorry. I dropped my phone.

9
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,910
God, Allison, you're such a klutz.

10
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,020
I saw you in the cafeteria today.
Do you always eat alone?

11
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,020
Um, well, I had to, uh...

12
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,620
She's only been in Tokyo for like,
three weeks or something.

13
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,730
No, actually, I've been at
your school for six months.

14
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,640
Oh, you have? Huh.

15
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,980
Well, no wonder you wear
your uniform like that.

16
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,070
Like what?

17
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,780
Roll it up. You'd look cooler.

18
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,090
No, no.

19
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,290
Here.

20
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,690
Higher.

21
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,700
That's better.

22
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,810
You should show off your legs more.
They're not bad.

23
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,100
Thanks.

24
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,920
You know, you should eat
with us sometime.

25
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,220
Really? Oh, that'd be great!

26
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,220
Let us check our calendar
and get back to you.

27
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,530
So, where are we going, anyway?

28
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,590
What is this place?

29
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,990
Come on, Allison.

30
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,300
This is it.

31
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,600
Can you feel it?

32
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,500
What do you mean?

33
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,510
They say this is one of
the most haunted houses...

34
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,210
in all of Japan.

35
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,520
Yeah. And that anyone who
goes inside gets the curse.

36
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,460
Come on.

37
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,370
Come on.

38
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,210
This is where the girl from
the International College...

39
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,910
killed her boyfriend two years ago.

40
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,150
Really?

41
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,050
Yeah.

42
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,060
She was the one who started
the fire that killed him.

43
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,360
Maybe they came here to,
you know...

44
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,480
Well, maybe you should bring
Michael down here,

45
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,580
since you two are so adventurous.

46
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,870
Come on, let's go upstairs.

47
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,370
It's in there.

48
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,860
The way up to the attic.

49
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,070
Where she lives.

50
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,270
Who?

51
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,180
What are you talking about?

52
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,180
Kayako.
The woman who was murdered here.

53
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,480
What?

54
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,690
Yeah.

55
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,800
He killed her.

56
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,100
He snapped her neck and
drowned their son in the tub.

57
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,500
He was so sick
he even killed the kid's cat...

58
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,010
before he hung himself.

59
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,410
But before he offed himself,

60
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,520
he wrapped up his wife's body
in plastic...

61
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,620
and stuffed her in the attic.

62
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,920
No way! I'm not going in there.

63
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,840
You don't have to go up, just inside.

64
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,730
If you close your eyes
and count to ten...

65
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,950
when you open them again
you'll see her.

66
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,450
All the other girls have
been too afraid to try.

67
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,460
Only me and Miyuki
have been able to do it so far.

68
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,020
One, two, three...

69
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,920
You have to go further in.

70
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,240
You have to close your eyes
before you start counting.

71
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,640
One, two, three, four...

72
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,250
Hey! C'mon, you guys,
open the door!

73
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,150
- Sorry, Allison.
- Open the door. Please!

74
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,950
Wait, wait, I gotta take a picture.

75
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,860
C'mon, you guys! This isn't funny!
I can't open it!

76
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,490
Okay, scaredy-cat.

77
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,490
Come on out.

78
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,690
Please! Please!

79
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,100
You guys! Please!
Let me out! Please open the door!

80
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,810
I can't open it.

81
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,020
Okay, Allison. Very funny.

82
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,920
We're not holding the door.
You should be able to open it.

83
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,700
Please! Please!

84
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,400
Hi, Mom. How are you feeling?

85
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,310
What took you so long?

86
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,720
What's going on?

87
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,720
Your sister's in the hospital.

88
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,820
What?

89
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,830
There's been an accident.

90
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,280
What, in Tokyo?
What kind of accident? Is she? Is she...

91
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,370
There was a fire.
They think she started it.

92
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,880
What?

93
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,790
And Doug's, Doug is dead.

94
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,090
Oh, no.

95
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,000
I booked a flight.
It leaves early tomorrow morning.

96
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,510
No... No, Mom, you can't fly.
You're too sick.

97
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,610
I'm not going.
You are.

98
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,720
I... I can't.

99
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:38,020
You see, you see, that's the difference
between you and Karen.

100
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,430
She knows how to face life.

101
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,170
I don't care that you girls
aren't speaking. She's your sister.

102
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,070
Believe me, I wish there was
someone else, but there isn't.

103
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,180
Bring her back.

104
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,620
Do you speak English?

105
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,170
Uh, Im, Im looking for my sister,
Karen Davis.

106
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,070
- Bring someone who can speak English.
- OK.

107
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,170
Just wait

108
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,070
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

109
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,270
I think this is
Karen Davis' sister.

110
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,980
Sister?

111
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,890
- Follow me.
- OK, thanks.

112
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,190
- I'll do it.
- OK, thanks.

113
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,890
She's here. They'll take you to her.

114
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,400
- Thank you.
- Come here

115
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,700
This way.

116
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,100
She might be Karen's sister.

117
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,550
Karen?

118
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,550
Karen?

119
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,180
You're here.

120
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,580
You're really here.

121
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,490
Thank god, you're here.

122
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,600
What did you do?

123
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,400
You need to help me.
You need to get me out of here now!

124
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,010
Okay, whoa, slow down.
Just stop for a second.

125
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,700
Tell me what happened.

126
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,300
Did you start that fire?

127
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,010
Aubrey, you have to get me out of here.

128
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,610
Karen, okay, You're scaring me. Stop.

129
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,340
Please, listen to me.
I'm the only person that can stop her.

130
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,650
- Who? Stop who?
- I have to go back there! I have to!

131
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,460
Please. It's my only chance.

132
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,560
Karen, I'm sorry.

133
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,760
- Take her outside.
- OK.

134
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,480
Aubrey...

135
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,080
don't go in that house.

136
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,610
- Alright.
- I can carry something else.

137
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,110
- Yeah? One more?
- Sure. No problem.

138
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,910
You sure? Alright.

139
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,020
- Can you carry this one?
- No.

140
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,310
- I could, actually, if you wanted me to.
- And you could. I know you could.

141
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,320
- Thanks, sweetie.
- There you go.

142
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,420
Alright. The kids are upstairs.

143
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,130
- I'm nervous.
- I know. It's going to be great.

144
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,820
- Yeah?
- Gonna be great. I swear.

145
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,030
C'mon, Jake.

146
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,940
- Welcome to your new home.
- Hey.

147
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,280
Okay, well, That's everything.

148
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,280
Why don't you help me take this
stuff back to the bedroom, okay?

149
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,680
Okay. Sally's coming to help
and I promised her pizza.

150
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,980
Pizza! Pizza Alright.

151
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,190
Hey.

152
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,390
Jake, come here, please.

153
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,490
I want you to get some of
this stuff out of the closet, all right?

154
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,590
Put it under your bed.
Make some room for Trish's coats. All right?

155
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,000
Here you go.

156
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:19,100
Take this, and this,
and how about this?

157
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,610
There you go. Very good.
Go, go... Thank you.

158
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,010
Are you okay?

159
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,920
Yeah. I'm just not sure that he is.

160
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,120
He's gonna be okay.
Just give him time.

161
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,230
- Trish, this is Sally.
- Hi, Trish.

162
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,460
- Thanks for helping.
- No sweat.

163
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,670
I hope you're hungry.
I'm gonna be ordering from Tufano's.

164
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,070
Tell them to send Billy.
He's totally hot.

165
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,280
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, nice meeting you.

166
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,980
I'm really glad you're
finally moving in.

167
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,280
Thanks.

168
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,090
Now it'll be easier for me
to borrow your clothes.

169
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,710
Jake.

170
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,520
Could you knock first?

171
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,820
Oh. Sorry.

172
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,860
Um, I'm sorry about the closet.

173
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,670
I know this must be really hard
for you, Jake.

174
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,070
I mean, it's a really big change.

175
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,280
And I just,
I just want you to know that

176
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,780
if you ever want to talk about anything
I would really like that.

177
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,880
I'm not going to call you 'Mom.' Okay?

178
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,290
Good.
Because I don't really want you to.

179
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,090
'Trish' works just fine for me. Deal?

180
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,090
Okay.

181
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,000
Hi, Mr. Fleming.

182
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Is she okay?

183
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
I don't really know.

184
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Look, I really need to talk to her.

185
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Are you a friend of hers or something?

186
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,500
No. I don't know her.

187
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I'm a journalist. My name's Eason.

188
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
I don't think she can
talk to you right now.

189
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
The doctors told me
they're going to sedate her.

190
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
She can't have any
visitors until tomorrow.

191
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
Open it.

192
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Don't go there!

193
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Excuse me. I just want to
talk to you about...

194
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Wait! I just wanna talk to you about
your sister and the house that she?

195
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:58,450
You can see how the shape of these
characters reflect their meanings.

196
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,650
This is the character 'ki.'

197
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,460
In English, it's 'tree.'

198
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,270
If you add another tree to it,
it becomes 'hayashi.'

199
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,770
In English it means 'woods.'

200
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:21,370
If you add another ki to it,
it becomes 'forest.'

201
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,180
Does anybody know how
to read this two Kanzi?

202
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,190
Sorry.

203
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,210
Now what does this look like?

204
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,220
Okay, I'll give you a clue.

205
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:10,830
Now, even with my awful righting,
I'm not a drawer.

206
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:16,640
But, as you can see, that it's a gate.

207
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,540
And, it's structured by two doors.

208
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,840
And the interesting thing...

209
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,260
Hey, Allison.
Are you feeling okay, sweetie?

210
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,450
Because I've been
really worried about you.

211
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,860
I heard you went to see
the school shrink this morning.

212
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,460
Poor thing.

213
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,310
I'm sorry.

214
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:27,510
- You're late.
- I know. I had to close up.

215
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,420
Let's go.

216
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,540
Pick anyone you like.

217
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,780
Let's go with this one.

218
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,990
Welcome, this is 8,900 Yen.

219
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,610
- I like it.
- Good.

220
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,110
Get comfortable. I'll be back.

221
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,870
Stop, Michael!

222
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,170
It tickles.

223
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,200
Miyuki.

224
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,690
Hello?

225
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,880
Karen?

226
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,890
Karen?

227
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,650
Let's begin with the first
incident three years ago.

228
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,350
Your colleagues were the primary
investigators on that case?

229
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,860
That is correct.

230
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,060
It's my understanding that
these colleagues have since disappeared.

231
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,570
They have.

232
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:38,580
A mother and the child were
killed in that house.

233
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,480
The husband murdered them.
I have questions about?

234
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:44,880
The incident happened as
reported in the local papers.

235
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,780
Understood.

236
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,890
Recently an American
family died in that house...

237
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,690
also under suspicious circumstances.

238
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:01,100
I cannot get into those details.

239
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:07,600
So, two incidents?
Two families died in one house?

240
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,810
So, two incidents?
Two families died in one house.

241
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,330
I cannot get into those details.

242
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:37,930
So, two incidents?
Two families died in one house.

243
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:27,830
Hello.

244
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,430
The cops said you were the one
that pulled my sister out of the fire.

245
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,240
I'm sorry about your sister.

246
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,550
I know why your sister did what she did.

247
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,400
- Here.
- Thanks.

248
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:03,900
Karen found all this stuff online.

249
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,610
Terrible things happened in that house.

250
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,410
I've been covering this story since
I moved to Tokyo three years ago.

251
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:19,010
Karen would've never done this.
It doesn't make any sense.

252
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,220
Ever since your sister
went inside that house...

253
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,220
she felt like
someone was there with her...

254
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,230
something watching her...

255
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,230
threatening her.

256
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,140
How do you know that?

257
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,740
Ever since I've been in the house
I've been experiencing the same things.

258
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,750
Your sister burned down
that house because...

259
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,580
she thought it would stop.

260
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,890
But the fire changed something.

261
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,090
I think it's getting worse.

262
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,700
Where are you going?

263
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,000
I was hoping you could tell me
something I don't already know.

264
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,800
But you can't.

265
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,400
I'm not even sure what I'm looking for anyways.

266
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,910
I've got no choice
but to go back to the house.

267
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,420
Well, I'll go with you.

268
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,720
- I don't want you to go.
- I'm going with you.

269
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,210
I am not leaving here until
I find out why my sister is dead.

270
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:23,390
So what's it gonna be,
PB & J or chicken salad?

271
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:29,500
Last night... did you hear it?

272
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,900
Okay, PB & J it is

273
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:36,200
Lacey, didn't you hear it?

274
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,510
There were sounds.

275
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:43,820
From next door.

276
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,430
What could you hear?

277
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,150
I heard the Flemings coming home.

278
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:59,060
They looked really... weird.

279
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,070
Weird? How?

280
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:03,760
Well, yesterday I...

281
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:07,470
I'm sorry, you guys.
Why didn't you get me up?

282
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:10,570
Good morning.

283
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,780
Tonight's final cut.
I'm pretty sure I'll make it.

284
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,980
You're totally gonna make it.

285
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,290
- Are you nervous?
- Not really.

286
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,590
- You should've tried out.
- Oh, please.

287
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,700
Jake!

288
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,100
Jake!
C'mon, hurry up!

289
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:51,550
Hello? Hey, Nate.

290
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:57,860
Really?
No, he never said that to me.

291
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,760
I don't know, maybe he left a message
on the cell, I'm not sure.

292
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,670
See, he wouldn't say that to me.
He would just say that to you.

293
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,170
Because he likes you, that's why.

294
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,770
You don't have to be coy.

295
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:19,370
I know, It's important to be professional
but you have to have a life.

296
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,580
Who are you talking to?

297
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,490
It's just Nate.

298
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:36,000
Are you okay?

299
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,500
I forgot my keys.

300
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,000
I'll go check the bedroom.

301
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,190
- Wait here.
- No, I... want...

302
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:46,090
Please. Just stay here.

303
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,270
Eason...

304
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,500
Aubrey...

305
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,310
please don't go in that house.

306
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,550
Aubrey! What are you doing in here?

307
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:29,560
Something pulled me in.

308
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,060
- I told you to stay outside.
- I didn't know...

309
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,260
We have to go. Now.

310
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,680
Come in.

311
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,990
Vanessa, please have a seat.

312
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:06,300
Allison has been telling me an
interesting story that I'd like you to verify.

313
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,100
A story about what?

314
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,210
About a visit you made with her
and Miyuki Nazawa to a certain house.

315
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:17,010
I'm sorry, Miss Dale,
but I don't know what she told you.

316
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:21,810
Please, Vanessa,
no one is in trouble here.

317
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:26,420
I just need to find out exactly
what happened in that house.

318
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,530
Miyuki is missing.

319
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,240
We just got the call.

320
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:43,740
Apparently she never came home
last night.

321
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,330
She said she was going to be
with her boyfriend, Michael.

322
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:52,350
Yes, we've spoken with him.
He said she disappeared.

323
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,250
Now you can understand, Vanessa,
how important it is that we hear the truth.

324
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,950
Why did you do this to me?

325
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:05,650
Why did you take me to that place?

326
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,760
You wanted to come.

327
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,200
What did I ever do to you?

328
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,000
Allison, wait!

329
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,500
Wait here.

330
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:19,390
Miyuki?

331
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:56,120
Miyuki... is that you?

332
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:26,970
Kayako kept this journal her whole life.

333
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:30,480
She was only eight
when she wrote this part.

334
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:35,100
Apparently, her mother was an Itako.

335
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:37,490
Itako? What is that?

336
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,940
It's a kind of channeler.

337
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:46,940
People believe they can talk with
deceased loved ones through them.

338
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:52,540
But... I don't understand this part.

339
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:58,950
I have a friend. He's really into folklore.
I think he can help us.

340
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,160
This is not Itako.

341
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,970
Wait.

342
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:14,680
This person who is written in diary
did channeler, but...

343
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:20,190
I can't say
this is channeler exactly.

344
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:25,290
I mean, something...

345
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:32,230
He says what Kayako wrote was about
the rituals her mother performed...

346
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:35,430
and how they were somewhat abnormal.

347
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:50,650
I can't explain it in English.

348
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:52,350
Shaman...

349
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:55,650
Exorcist.

350
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:00,660
It must be named Exorcist.

351
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,270
There's no real word to
describe it in English, but...

352
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,570
the closest thing would be 'exorcist'.

353
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:23,780
She did this to her daughter.

354
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:30,190
Take demon away from
people's mind or body.

355
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,990
- What is it?
- She let daughter eat

356
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:36,490
- Eason?
- Demon everyday.

357
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:37,790
Eason!

358
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:41,000
I've never heard about it.

359
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:46,200
It... it sounds like her mother
was able to cure people

360
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,900
through extracting evil spirits...

361
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,510
out of their bodies...

362
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:57,110
and feeding them to her daughter.

363
01:04:58,050 --> 01:04:59,210
What?

364
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,740
First thing tomorrow
morning we have to go see her.

365
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,440
See who?

366
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:32,080
Kayako's mother.

367
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:43,300
I've tried everything.
I even went back to the house. I...

368
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:47,190
Look...

369
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:53,900
if she can really take evil spirits
out of people, maybe she can help us.

370
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:00,510
I don't know what to believe any more.

371
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:08,520
We don't have a choice.
It's our only hope.

372
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,920
Okay.

373
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,440
This is the research
I was doing for the story.

374
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,280
I've got her childhood address...

375
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,380
right here.

376
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:52,200
It's a small village.

377
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:02,510
The train will only take us halfway.
We'll have to switch to a bus.

378
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:16,320
Last time I saw Karen,
we got into this huge fight.

379
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,920
It was really stupid.

380
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:28,430
She took me out to lunch and she
dropped this college application on me...

381
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:31,770
and I... I was just...

382
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,890
I was so pissed.

383
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:51,690
I thought she was trying to be
just like my mother.

384
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:58,590
I screamed at her to stop trying
to change my life and leave me alone.

385
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:04,600
She did.

386
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,010
We never spoke again until last night.

387
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:20,920
I always, I always blamed Karen for
my mother's indifference towards me.

388
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:27,430
But I know that wasn't true,
and I really...

389
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:30,660
I really regret...

390
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:37,970
Well, you know, it's strange.

391
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:43,670
Back in Hong Kong, my brother lived
a few blocks away from me for four years.

392
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:47,180
We never even tried to see each other.

393
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,690
I'll make some tea.

394
01:08:57,330 --> 01:08:58,590
Yeah, thanks.

395
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:07,470
Eason?

396
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,580
Eason?

397
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,340
Eason? Are you in here?

398
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,740
Eason?

399
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:25,170
Eason?

400
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,080
Eason...

401
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:37,280
Eason... Eason!

402
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:38,590
Eason!

403
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:12,150
Jeez, you sick or something?

404
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,460
So... what do you think?

405
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,080
Sally, are you okay?

406
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:57,900
Jake?

407
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:06,410
No, it's okay.
I'll be right there.

408
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:09,810
I have to go.

409
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:48,020
Jake?

410
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:02,080
God!

411
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:04,890
Jake. What are you doing in here?

412
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:09,400
I... I was scared.

413
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:11,590
What were you scared of?

414
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:13,200
Trish.

415
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,200
And Dad.

416
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,310
They were fighting, Lacey.

417
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:26,310
Where are they?

418
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:31,520
I... I don't know...

419
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,920
But I wish Mom was here.

420
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,020
Jake...

421
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:37,310
Mr. Fleming?

422
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:46,210
Hi...

423
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:26,600
What's wrong, Jake?

424
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:29,600
I went next door and I...

425
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:33,000
- You went where?
- Next door.

426
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:38,500
I saw something in the window... eyes.

427
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,010
It's all right, Jake. It's okay.

428
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:43,510
Something is really wrong, Lacey.

429
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:48,710
Tomorrow I promise
I'll go there with you. Okay?

430
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,520
Just try and get some sleep now.

431
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:36,600
Dammit!

432
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,880
You got home late last night.

433
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:31,280
Where were you?

434
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:39,390
Come in.

435
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,310
Allison...

436
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:56,150
Allison, are you all right?

437
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,750
Maybe we should go see the nurse.

438
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:02,240
I want to go home.

439
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:11,360
Take a breath.

440
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,460
Tell me what's going on.
You can talk to me.

441
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,670
It was that house.

442
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:28,370
There was something there
when I was there.

443
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:29,670
I...

444
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,490
I just want to go home.

445
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:47,000
Allison, Listen...
I've been to that house with the police.

446
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:49,500
There's nothing there.

447
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:52,900
It's just an abandoned house.

448
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:58,230
You... went there?

449
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,050
Yes, I did.

450
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,950
She's going to come for you.

451
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:13,850
She got Miyuki and Vanessa...

452
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:16,360
and now she's after me.

453
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:17,650
Allison...

454
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

455
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,970
- What?
- They are right here.

456
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:03,890
Hello?

457
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,730
I need to speak to you about
your daughter Kayako.

458
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:51,740
I saw the journal.
I know you can get rid of evil spirits.

459
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:56,280
She is dead.

460
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,080
You did this.
You made her what she was.

461
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:02,690
Now, I need you to help me
help me end this.

462
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,190
Wait!

463
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:13,490
People came looking for me.

464
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:17,900
Full of pain and suffering...

465
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:33,210
I took the dark spirits from them.

466
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,810
And so did my daughter.

467
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:42,310
You poisoned her.
Look what she has become.

468
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:48,120
I did not create this evil.

469
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:53,330
Kayako was killed by her
husband because she was foolish.

470
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:56,670
That is where the curse started.

471
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:00,970
I did not make her what she is now.

472
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,680
My sister tried to burn down
the house where Kayako was killed.

473
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,690
She thought if she burned down
the house that it would stop?

474
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:13,690
This is not about a house.

475
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:18,890
You are just making things worse.

476
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:24,200
She wants us to suffer the way
she has suffered.

477
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:31,200
- No. We have to make it stop.
- No, it will not stop.

478
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:37,610
It will grow
and destroy everything it touches.

479
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:41,420
It will spread beyond the house.

480
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:47,020
There can be no end to what has started.

481
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,960
You brought her here.

482
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:55,250
Hey.

483
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:57,850
Are you okay?

484
01:30:57,990 --> 01:30:59,550
Something bad.

485
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:02,450
What?

486
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:04,960
Something bad lives there.

487
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,960
That is what's making
everything else bad here.

488
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:16,970
Come on, Jake.
Let's go.

489
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,480
Dad?

490
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:34,590
Trish?

491
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,000
Dad?

492
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,560
Just wait here.

493
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:17,960
Dad? Trish?

494
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:51,380
Hello?

495
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,890
Hi, Mom, it's me.

496
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,990
I've been waiting for you.

497
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:04,500
Where have you been?
How is Karen?

498
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:12,930
She's gone, mom.

499
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:18,040
- I'm sorry.
- She's gone?

500
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:27,850
I know how much you loved her. I...

501
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:30,750
I know she was everything to you.

502
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:35,560
Why have you done this? You were...
You were supposed to bring her back!

503
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,660
You could never do anything
on your own.

504
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:45,260
I love you so much...

505
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:50,680
but you can't talk to me
like this anymore.

506
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:55,780
This has to end.

507
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,180
Aubrey!

508
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,390
- Aubrey!
- I love you, Mom. Goodbye.

509
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:46,570
My sister is dead.

510
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:52,170
You killed her...

511
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:56,970
just like you killed the others.

512
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:04,080
You won't stop. Why?

513
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,280
What do you want?

514
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:14,790
Doug?

515
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:23,200
Wait... Karen!

516
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,700
Karen?

517
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:31,610
Karen, no!

518
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:46,410
Lacey!

519
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:53,020
Lacey! Lacey!

520
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:02,730
Lacey! Lacey!

521
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:05,630
No. No

522
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:07,540
Lacey!

523
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:09,440
- No!
- Jake.

524
01:37:28,630 --> 01:37:30,390
It's time for your bath.

525
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,080
Karen?

526
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:43,810
They say this is one of the most
haunted houses...

527
01:41:43,950 --> 01:41:46,850
in all of Japan.

528
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:48,450
Yeah.

529
01:41:48,590 --> 01:41:51,750
And that anyone who goes
inside gets the curse.

530
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:10,870
All the other girls
have been too afraid to try.

531
01:42:11,010 --> 01:42:13,980
Only me and Miyuki
have been able to do it so far.

532
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:39,300
Help me!

533
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:42,400
Please, you have to help me!

534
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:54,740
He killed her.

535
01:42:56,090 --> 01:42:58,060
He snapped her neck.

536
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:04,460
If you close your eyes
and count to ten...

537
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:07,760
when you open them again,
you'll see her.

538
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:18,570
It's all your fault!
What did you do?

539
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:21,980
What did you bring here?

540
01:43:22,110 --> 01:43:27,280
It followed me here.
They followed me here.

541
01:43:28,305 --> 01:44:28,722
