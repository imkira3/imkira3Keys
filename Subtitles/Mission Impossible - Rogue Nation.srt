00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,280
<i>Benji?</i>

3
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,364
<i>Benji, do you copy?</i>

4
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,531
<i>Benji?</i>

5
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,882
- Shit.
<i>- Where is Ethan?</i>

6
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,801
Uh, I can't talk right now.

7
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,726
<i>The package is on the plane.</i>

8
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,370
Yeah, I know.

9
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,286
<i>We're currently formulating a plan B.
Although, technically, it's a plan C.</i>

10
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,044
This isn't going very well.

11
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,009
<i>I am aware of that, Brandt.
You're not helping.</i>

12
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,651
- Where's Ethan?
- I don't know. We're on radio silence.

13
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,331
That plane cannot take off
with the package on it.

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
- Do you understand?
<i>- We're working on it.</i>

15
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,727
Luther?
What the hell are you doing there?

16
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,484
<i>You're supposed to be
on assignment in Malaysia!</i>

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,244
I am in Malaysia.
I've been here two days.

18
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,243
- Benji needed my help.
- I didn't need help.

19
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,800
I needed assistance.
It's a different thing.

20
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,240
The package is still on the plane.

21
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,449
<i>We understand the package
is on the plane.</i>

22
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,807
- We're trying to cripple it remotely.
- You can do that?

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,646
We can if the pilot left
the satellite uplink switched on.

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,846
Which he has.

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,402
- And how do you access the uplink?
- It involves hacking a Russian satellite.

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,324
- I can't authorize that.
- Which is why I didn't ask permission.

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,086
We're under investigation
for misconduct.

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,367
The package is on board.
What do you want me to do?

29
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,045
Uh, Luther.

30
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,044
I'm reading a heat bloom,
Benji.

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,282
- The engines are starting.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,246
<i>But I can't do anything
until I'm connected to the satellite.</i>

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,326
Benji, you're connected.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,606
Okay, great.

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,485
The package is still on that plane.

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,880
<i>Shut down the fuel pump.</i>

37
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,489
Uh, the mechanicals
are locked down.

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,001
- What about the electrical system?
- Oh, that might work.

39
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,321
Uh, no.

40
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,283
- Hydraulics!
<i>- Okay, stand by.</i>

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,930
No, they're encrypted.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,001
Benji, the plane!

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,367
Yes! The package is on the plane!
We get it!

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,281
Can you open the door?

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,611
Ethan? Where are you?

46
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,331
<i>I'm by the plane.
Benji, can you open the door?</i>

47
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,807
Uh, can I open the door? Uh, maybe.

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,009
Open the door when I tell you!

49
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,364
<i>I'm on the plane. Open the door.</i>

50
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,561
<i>How did you get in the plane?</i>

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,291
<i>Not in the plane.
I'm on the plane!</i>

52
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,329
Open the door!

53
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,889
Benji! Open the door!

54
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,805
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay!

55
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,440
- Benji, open that door right now!
- Yeah, I'm trying!

56
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,360
- Come on, Benji!
- Benji, open that door!

57
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,687
Come on! Come on!

58
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,046
Come on!

59
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,201
Yes, got it!

60
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,405
That's the wrong door!

61
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,209
Benji, not that door.
The other door.

62
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,520
The other door, right!
Yes, the other door.

63
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,688
Okay, yes! Sorry, my bad, my bad!

64
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,961
Check it out.

65
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,366
All right, look, I'm gonna open
the para door! How's that?

66
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,480
Hey! Hey!

67
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,810
We're about to close.

68
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,411
I won't be long.

69
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,167
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

70
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,368
Something rare.

71
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,570
Let me guess.

72
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,561
Classical.

73
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,685
- Jazz.
- Sax?

74
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,083
- Coltrane.
- Piano?

75
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,161
Monk.

76
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,081
Shadow Wilson on bass.

77
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,322
Shadow Wilson played drums.

78
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,568
Know why they call him Shadow?

79
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,441
Because he had a light touch.

80
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,811
You're in luck.

81
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,528
I have a first pressing.

82
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,730
It really is you.

83
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,206
I've heard stories.

84
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,924
They can't all be true.

85
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,924
<i>Good evening, Mr. Hunt.</i>

86
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,800
<i>The weapons you recovered in Belarus
were confirmed to be VX nerve gas</i>

87
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,723
<i>capable of devastating a major city.</i>

88
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,170
<i>The bodies of the air crew were found</i>

89
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,084
<i>less than 24 hours
after they landed in Damascus.</i>

90
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,323
<i>They were identified as
low-level Chechen separatists</i>

91
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,243
<i>with neither the access nor the ability</i>

92
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,448
<i>to acquire the weapons
they were transporting.</i>

93
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,005
<i>This would support your suspicion</i>

94
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,368
<i>that a shadow organization
is committed to inciting revolution</i>

95
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,081
<i>by enabling acts of terror
in nations friendly to Western interests.</i>

96
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,604
<i>IMF suspects this to be
the same shadow organization</i>

97
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,842
<i>you have been tracking for the last year,</i>

98
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,809
<i>also known as the Syndicate.</i>

99
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,362
<i>IMF would be right.</i>

100
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,808
<i>Normally, you and your team
would be tasked</i>

101
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,884
<i>with infiltrating and disrupting
this terrorist network.</i>

102
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,601
<i>But we have taken steps to ensure
that this will not happen.</i>

103
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,286
<i>Because we are
the Syndicate, Mr. Hunt.</i>

104
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,601
<i>And now we know who you are.</i>

105
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,841
<i>Your mission, should you choose
to accept it, is to face your fate.</i>

106
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,205
<i>Pursue us, you will be caught.
Resist us, you will be killed.</i>

107
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,251
<i>And your precious Secretary will
disavow any knowledge of your actions.</i>

108
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,646
<i>Good luck, Mr. Hunt.</i>

109
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,371
<i>This message will self-destruct
in five seconds.</i>

110
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,445
<i>Mr. Chairman,
the IMF's misadventures date back</i>

111
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,363
to my earliest days at the CIA

112
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,923
when the IMF broke into the CIA
to steal a list of covert operatives.

113
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,123
And now, more recently,
a Russian warhead?

114
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,281
Disarmed Russian warhead.

115
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,840
- A Russian nuclear warhead...
- Rendered safe by the IMF.

116
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,689
...clipped the Transamerica Pyramid

117
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,603
before plunging into
the San Francisco Bay.

118
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,650
- Saving the western hemisphere.
- This made possible by IMF agents

119
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,685
who did willingly provide
the launch codes to a known terrorist.

120
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,160
Do I have that right, Agent Brandt?

121
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,122
I can neither confirm nor deny details

122
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,282
of any such operation
without the Secretary's approval.

123
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,204
This was the same week that the IMF
infiltrated the Kremlin.

124
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,645
Here is the Kremlin before

125
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,324
and the Kremlin after.

126
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,924
I can neither confirm nor deny details
of any operation...

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,764
Without the Secretary's approval,
yes, we know.

128
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,161
In fact, until this panel appoints
a new Secretary,

129
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,686
you really can't say much of anything,
can you, Agent Brandt?

130
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,250
Well, I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley.

131
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,085
Mr. Chairman,
the so-called Impossible Mission Force

132
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,288
is not just a rogue organization.

133
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,285
It is an outdated one, a throwback
to an era without transparency

134
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,920
- and without oversight.
- Mr. Chairman?

135
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,531
- Time has come to dissolve the IMF...
- Mr. Chairman?

136
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,008
...and transfer their salvageable assets
to the CIA.

137
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,084
Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated
without oversight for 40 years.

138
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,845
- Mr. Chairman?
- Are its methods unorthodox? Yes.

139
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,844
Are its results less than perfect?
Absolutely.

140
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,571
- But without the IMF...
- There will be order and stability!

141
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,005
Without the IMF...

142
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,881
This panel recognizes
the IMF's contribution to global security.

143
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,328
But the events laid out
by CIA Director Hunley

144
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,364
also show a pattern
of wanton brinksmanship

145
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,284
and a total disregard for protocol.

146
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,125
From where I sit,
your unorthodox methods

147
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,567
are indistinguishable from chance.

148
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,726
And your results, perfect or not,
look suspiciously like luck.

149
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,165
I'm afraid today is the day
when the IMF's luck runs out.

150
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,090
What are you doing here?

151
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,721
Hmm?

152
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,207
I said, what are you doing here?

153
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,129
What does he see in you, I wonder?

154
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,606
Who is "he"?

155
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,003
I want to see what he's made of.

156
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,287
Well, why don't you
take off the cuffs and I'll show you,

157
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,441
Vinter?

158
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,210
You know who I am.

159
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,124
Janik Vinter.

160
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,970
They call you the Bone Doctor.

161
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,806
The funny thing is,

162
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,208
you were officially declared dead
three years ago.

163
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,927
Nice shoes, by the way.

164
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,641
Not his.

165
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,960
Yours.

166
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,723
Our instructions were to break him down...

167
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,959
...not kill him.

168
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,247
Some guys break different than others.

169
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,170
This one's a fighter.

170
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,728
He'll die before you turn him.

171
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,920
Are you worried
he's going to take your place?

172
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,047
You should go before it gets ugly.

173
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,403
Yeah, he's right. You should go.

174
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,409
So now let's see how tough you are.

175
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,171
Janik.

176
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,367
We've never met before, right?

177
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,761
Follow me.

178
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,281
Give me the gun!

179
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,001
- What are you doing?
- I can't leave.

180
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,169
You can't stay.
We just killed those men.

181
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,806
We didn't kill them, you did.

182
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,281
I tried to stop you. You got away.

183
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,806
Who are you?

184
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,801
You better hurry now. Good luck.

185
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,961
No, wait! Wait!

186
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,241
Where is he?

187
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,920
He's heading towards the north passage.
He's closed the gate.

188
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,651
Run. He's getting away. HURRY.

189
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,401
- Satcom seven.
<i>- Western Europe unsecured.</i>

190
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,802
- Designator?
<i>- Bravo-Echo-1-1.</i>

191
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,881
Connecting.

192
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,842
- This is Brandt.
<i>- Go secure.</i>

193
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,761
Go.

194
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,844
<i>London terminal is compromised.
Repeat, London is compromised.</i>

195
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,924
Agent in place is down.
Request immediate extraction.

196
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,650
What happened?
Who breached London?

197
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,490
<i>Do you have anything to go on?</i>

198
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,686
A face.

199
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,442
<i>He wanted something. Not information.
He could've killed me.</i>

200
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,087
But he didn't.

201
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,723
- Okay. What do you think it means?
- The Syndicate is real.

202
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,846
They know who we are, how we operate.

203
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,925
I think I know why
they've been so hard to find.

204
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,561
Just focus operations on gathering
any available intel regarding

205
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,091
former covert operatives.

206
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,242
It doesn't matter
what country or agency,

207
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,607
just as long as they're dead
or presumed dead.

208
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,047
Start with Janik Vinter.

209
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,168
<i>He's also known as the Bone Doctor.</i>

210
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,401
I can't do that.

211
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,762
What? What are you talking about?

212
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,682
The Committee has shut us down.

213
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,367
Operations have been handed over
to the CIA.

214
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,965
<i>There is no more IMF.
I've been ordered to bring everyone in.</i>

215
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,369
<i>- Ethan...</i>
- I understand.

216
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,284
<i>- Ethan...</i>
- I understand, Brandt.

217
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,090
We didn't have this conversation.

218
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,446
I've disappeared in London.
You don't know where I am.

219
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,484
<i>If I'm dead or alive.</i>

220
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,130
This man you saw, can you find him?

221
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,242
I won't stop until I do.

222
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,006
This may very well be
our last mission, Ethan.

223
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,931
Make it count.

224
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,560
Brandt?

225
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,684
<i>Since we're going
to be working together,</i>

226
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,800
<i>I want you to choose
your next words very carefully.</i>

227
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,166
Where is Hunt?

228
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,203
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me, Brandt.

229
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,806
I have no way of contacting him.
He's deep cover.

230
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,723
Last I heard,
he's tracking the Syndicate.

231
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,284
Let's cut the bull. You know who we are,
you know what we're capable of.

232
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,044
How come the CIA has never discovered

233
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,805
any actionable intel
regarding this, uh, Syndicate?

234
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,851
- What are you implying?
- Not implying. Stating.

235
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,127
Leveling an accusation, actually.

236
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,409
Hunt is both arsonist and fireman
at the same time.

237
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,326
I believe that the Syndicate
is a figment of his imagination,

238
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,244
created to justify the IMF's existence.

239
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,041
I am going to find him, Brandt,
and when I do,

240
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,844
he will be called upon to answer for

241
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,242
every wanton act of mayhem
he is responsible for.

242
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,490
Welcome to the CIA.

243
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,649
You'll never find him.

244
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,322
Set your watch, Brandt. Ethan Hunt
is living his last day as a free man.

245
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,849
All right, everybody, heads up! This is it.

246
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,770
<i>Alpha team prepped, standing by.</i>

247
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,841
Execute.

248
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,924
Langley, Brimstone. Go.
I say again, we are go.

249
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,761
<i>Langley, there's nobody here.</i>

250
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,283
Langley, Brimstone.
Face the north wall.

251
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,961
Dunn.

252
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,046
Is it that time already? Okay.

253
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,280
I will ask you
a series of control questions.

254
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,044
I know,
and I'm gonna answer truthfully,

255
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,487
and then you're gonna ask me
to lie intentionally.

256
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,961
- State your name.
- The King of Norway.

257
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,001
See, that's a lie.

258
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,643
I'm actually third in line to the throne.
My brother was...

259
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,405
Has Ethan Hunt contacted you?

260
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
Why would he contact me?

261
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,601
Hunt has resurfaced.

262
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,205
This time in Cuba.

263
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,370
He, uh, left these behind.

264
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,324
Tell me what you make of them.

265
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,802
I don't know.
He's taken up scrapbooking?

266
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,245
Look at the photographs, Dunn.

267
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,126
All of them are either missing or dead.
Every one.

268
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,204
All of them were government agents.

269
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,408
Russian, French, British, Israeli,
you name it.

270
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,727
These are highly classified files and yet
Hunt had no trouble collecting them.

271
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,121
And he always seems to be
a step ahead of us.

272
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,651
I wonder how.

273
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
- Are you suggesting I'm helping him?
- Oh, the thought had crossed my mind.

274
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,644
Six months I have been here,

275
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,884
sifting through mountains of metadata
and exabytes of encoded excrement.

276
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,124
I have decrypted, processed, parsed
more data than anyone in my section.

277
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,083
And yet, every week you haul me in here

278
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,044
and you ask me the same question,
just in a different way.

279
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,970
And today you haven't answered it.

280
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,563
You seem to think
I have some kind of obligation to him.

281
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,686
Okay. Nothing could be further
from the truth.

282
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,684
Ethan Hunt is still out there in the field,

283
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,605
and I am stuck here answering for it.

284
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,164
We are not friends.

285
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,681
I owe him nothing.

286
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,443
That'll be all, Dunn.

287
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,402
<i>Welcome to Vienna, Benji. Miss me?</i>

288
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,041
Ethan, where are you?
Where the hell have you been?

289
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,009
You know what?
Please, don't tell me that.

290
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,050
Because it's just another thing I'll have
to lie about in my weekly polygraph.

291
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,122
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.
Just keep walking.</i>

292
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,282
<i>But make sure
you're not being followed.</i>

293
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,328
I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?

294
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,811
<i>No, I'm afraid not.</i>

295
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,280
- So, where do we meet'?
<i>- We don't.</i>

296
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,280
<i>For your sake,
we shouldn't be seen together.</i>

297
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,247
<i>You have mail.</i>

298
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
- Who is he?
<i>- That's what</i>

299
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,047
<i>we're here to find out.</i>

300
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,329
<i>What I do know is he's our
only possible link to the Syndicate.</i>

301
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,846
<i>And I have reason to believe
he's going to be here tonight.</i>

302
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,851
<i>But I can't find him alone.
Are you in?</i>

303
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,604
- Uh...
<i>- Are you in?</i>

304
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,364
Yes, of course. Of course. Urn...

305
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,961
So what's the play?

306
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,806
<i>Simple. You find him. We tag him.
I follow him wherever he goes.</i>

307
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,081
And after that?

308
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,605
<i>After that, you're on a plane.</i>

309
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,650
<i>Back at work Monday morning.
No one is the wiser.</i>

310
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,289
- Wait, that's it?
<i>- You're in enough danger as it is.</i>

311
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,931
<i>I didn't want to involve you this much,
but I had no choice.</i>

312
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,604
Well, if you're going to bring me
all this way,

313
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,763
you could at least give me something
a bit more, you know, dramatic.

314
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,646
<i>Benji, we're trying to keep a low profile.</i>

315
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,244
<i>You want drama, go to the opera.</i>

316
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,644
- Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
<i>- Yes, I am.</i>

317
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,962
<i>Am I correct in assuming
that is the Chancellor of Austria?</i>

318
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,485
Yes, you are.

319
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,324
<i>Did you know
he was going to be here?</i>

320
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
No.

321
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,410
<i>Right. Well, we have
a European head of state here</i>

322
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,280
<i>at the same time as we are looking
for a nefarious terrorist.</i>

323
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,091
<i>And I'm sure that the two things
are completely unrelated.</i>

324
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,161
Benji.

325
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,810
<i>Meanwhile, I will try and overlook
the fact that</i>

326
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,571
<i>you're an international fugitive
wanted by the CIA!</i>

327
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,008
<i>And that this little unsanctioned
operation is tantamount to treason.</i>

328
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,766
<i>Because, as you stated earlier, I will be
back at my desk on Monday morning,</i>

329
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,411
playing videogames,
and no one will be any the wiser.

330
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,891
- <i>The show's about to start, Benji.</i>
- Right.

331
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,200
<i>Just take your position.</i>

332
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,691
<i>- Tell me what you see.</i>
- Okay.

333
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,171
<i>Nice tux, by the way.</i>

334
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,082
Lights ready, Act One preset.

335
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,559
Final preparations complete.

336
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,846
Everyone standby please.

337
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,246
Join the IMF! See the world!

338
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,245
On a monitor. In a closet.

339
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,011
Okay, I have eyes.

340
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,290
Searching.

341
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,725
Talk to me, Benji.

342
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,290
Nothing yet. Stand by.

343
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,681
I know you're here. Where are you?

344
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,844
Uh, Ethan, I might have
something for you. Can't confirm.

345
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,689
- Where?
- Backstage. I'll direct you.

346
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,084
<i>Take the door on your left.</i>

347
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,009
He should be right in front of you.

348
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,886
Benji, do you see that?

349
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,200
<i>See what?</i>

350
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,731
- That woman.
- What woman? Where are you?

351
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,246
I can't see you.

352
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,602
What was that?

353
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,125
I don't know.

354
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,890
Oh! Ah!

355
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,962
Ethan, do you copy? Ethan, come in!

356
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,766
Ethan, the lighting booth!

357
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,205
Ethan, do you copy?

358
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,086
It's just a fleshwound.

359
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,731
Seal the building. Close the exits.

360
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,887
I have a way out. Interested?

361
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,810
Lead the way.

362
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,010
- Anything you want to tell me?
- Uh, no, not right now.

363
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,841
- How's the pace?
- Don't wait for me.

364
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,766
What's next?

365
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,361
There.

366
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,086
Shoes.

367
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,250
Shoes, please.

368
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,721
Uh...

369
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,283
If anything were to happen to you -

370
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,169
Nothing's going to happen to me.

371
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
STOP THE CAR.

372
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,241
Get in!

373
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,726
Go, go, go.

374
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,281
What the... She tried to shoot me!

375
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,523
That doesn't make her a bad person.

376
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,891
I'm going to have to search you.

377
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,566
- You have to let me go.
- Oh. Not a chance!

378
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,400
I assumed you were deep cover
back in London,

379
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,200
but isn't this taking
the role a little far?

380
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,730
Hang on a minute.
Do you know her?

381
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,245
We haven't been formally introduced,

382
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,687
but I'm pretty sure
she's British intelligence?

383
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,122
Ilsa Faust. You're Ethan Hunt.

384
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,691
And that shade is very hard to find.

385
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,331
What were you doing
at the opera tonight?

386
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,925
Aside from killing the Chancellor.

387
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,367
Saving your life in London
put me in a tight spot

388
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,408
with some very dangerous people.

389
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,680
I was sent to kill the Chancellor
to regain their trust.

390
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,530
Ah, so you admit that you killed him!

391
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,723
I went through the motions.
That's not the same thing.

392
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,490
You thought you'd put him
in the hospital,

393
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,925
take him out of harm's way.

394
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,081
Same thing you tried to do.

395
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,561
You're not going to
believe that, are you?

396
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,005
What about the rest of her team?

397
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,923
You mean those other two idiots.

398
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,764
I can only assume
they were redundancies.

399
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,889
In case you didn't follow through.
One man to kill the Chancellor,

400
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,445
the other one to kill you.

401
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,730
- A test.
- Second one I've failed, thanks to you.

402
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,201
And the car bomb was insurance.

403
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,886
Uh, we have a tail.

404
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,651
Who is he?

405
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,288
We're after the same thing,
and I can help you.

406
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,125
If you want to bring down the Syndicate,
you have to let me out.

407
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,281
Uh, they're closing!

408
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,731
This has to look like an escape,
so you just throw me out anywhere.

409
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,245
Tell me who he is.

410
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,367
Whoa!

411
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,403
Change of plan! Throw her out!

412
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,729
You have everything you need
to find me.

413
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,320
<i>Less than 24 hours</i>

414
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,283
<i>after we interviewed Benji Dunn
about Ethan Hunt,</i>

415
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,764
He was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera.

416
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,764
And within six hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead.

417
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,207
Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defender,

418
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,250
but to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence.

419
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,322
Consider for the moment
the possibility that

420
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,841
Ethan's investigation
led him to the opera,

421
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,570
and that he's the one
with the actionable intelligence!

422
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,770
In any case, finding Hunt
is no longer a pet project.

423
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,447
The Special Activities Division
will now have full discretion.

424
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,681
You mean shoot to kill.

425
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,210
Whether Hunt lives or dies
is entirely up to him.

426
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,361
New identity.

427
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,921
Passport, cash, move map.

428
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,286
There's a change of clothes
in that bag right there.

429
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,006
Everything you need
to make it to DC. undetected.

430
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,209
Once you're there,
you have to inform on me.

431
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,888
- I'm sorry, what?
- Just tell the truth.

432
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,804
You came to Vienna believing
you won two tickets to the opera.

433
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,451
I attempted to recruit you
into assassinating the Chancellor.

434
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,000
- You refused.
- That's not the truth!

435
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,447
Your life depends on
them believing you, Benji.

436
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,761
It'll go easier
if you tell them what they want to hear.

437
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,367
Ethan, at least tell me
what this is all about.

438
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,885
You recognize anyone?

439
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,281
Him.

440
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,408
He's former KSA. German intelligence.

441
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,050
Missing, presumed dead.

442
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,969
He was at the opera tonight.

443
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,451
This one, too.

444
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,285
Former Mossad.

445
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,010
Let me guess. Presumed dead.

446
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,770
Tonight, I made it official.

447
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,927
I was looking for him in the Bosphorus.

448
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,482
The same day, a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi.

449
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,569
He slipped away again in Jakarta,

450
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,450
hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacific

451
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,761
with 236 passengers.

452
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,889
I just missed him in the Philippines

453
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,167
right before a fire
at a petrochemical plant

454
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,208
gassed a village of 2,000 people.

455
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,121
You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.

456
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,890
That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank.

457
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,611
That fire bankrupted
a global arms corporation.

458
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,282
That wreck triggered a civil war.

459
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,890
These are no accidents.

460
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,126
They're links in a chain.

461
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,443
The work of a single organization,
the Syndicate.

462
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,647
A rogue nation,
trained to do what we do,

463
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,404
imbued with a new sense of purpose.

464
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,451
Destroy the system that created them
regardless of who's in their way.

465
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,890
An anti-IMF.

466
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,166
Since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked.

467
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,766
Killing the Chancellor tonight
was a statement,

468
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,490
the start of a new phase.

469
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,681
Or they could just be
a series of random disasters.

470
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,321
He was there.

471
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,006
Every time.

472
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,321
Just like he was there tonight,
I'm sure of it.

473
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,290
I don't know who he is, where he's from,

474
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,923
how he's funded.

475
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,843
But I know he's the key.

476
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,800
Ethan, this is what I signed up for.
Let me help you find him.

477
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,689
That's why I brought you here
in the first place,

478
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,285
and look what happened!

479
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,805
I can't protect you.

480
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,162
That's why I need you to leave.

481
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,811
That's not your decision to make, Ethan!

482
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,131
I am a field agent. I know the risks.

483
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,850
More than that, I am your friend,

484
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,888
no matter what I tell
the polygraph every week.

485
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,930
Now, you called me
because you needed my help.

486
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,321
And you still do. So I am staying.

487
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,521
And that is all
we are going to say about that.

488
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,721
Okay.

489
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,087
Good.

490
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,041
Where do we start?

491
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,401
Ilsa.

492
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,048
Right. And how do we find her?

493
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,608
She said we have everything we need.

494
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,608
We had an agreement.

495
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,127
You send me to do a job, I do it.
But my way, not yours.

496
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,565
Where did I deviate?

497
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,642
You put two more gunmen
at the opera tonight.

498
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,926
One of them tried to kill me.

499
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,481
You missed.

500
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,211
I missed because Ethan Hunt was there
looking for you.

501
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,648
Ethan Hunt's in Vienna because
you allowed him to escape in London.

502
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,929
Vinter would have killed him in London,
and that's not what you asked for.

503
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,286
Twice now you've let him slip away.

504
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,126
Curious.

505
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,364
Are you questioning my loyalty
or my ability?

506
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,731
- Can't decide.
- I've told you before, trust me or kill me.

507
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,009
But if you're going to kill me, be a man.

508
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,765
Do it yourself.

509
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,049
Did he say anything?

510
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,448
He knows about Morocco.

511
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,689
What does he know about Morocco?

512
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,166
He knows about the power plant.
He doesn't know what's in it.

513
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,006
Find him, please.

514
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,285
He'll find me.

515
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,164
I've seen to that.

516
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,731
That's interesting.

517
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,325
- What is it?
- It's a skiff.

518
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,244
A secure computer facility.
Offline, ultra-contained.

519
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,283
It's impossible to hack into
from the outside.

520
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,931
It's essentially
a digital safety deposit box.

521
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,362
Very strange thing for a young lady
to be carrying in her sundries.

522
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,920
Where's it located?

523
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,126
Uh...

524
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,281
Morocco.

525
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,600
Morocco.

526
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,080
And what brings you gentlemen
to Casablanca?

527
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,081
Good to see you.

528
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,481
What couldn't you tell me
over the phone?

529
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,011
The Chancellor of Austria
was assassinated.

530
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,765
We believe that
Ethan and Benji were there.

531
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,163
Hunley has handed this over
to the Special Activities Division.

532
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,606
We need to find Ethan before they do.

533
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,205
And that's where you come in.

534
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,765
Not interested.

535
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,683
- Okay, look, Luther...
- Look, man, I know Ethan.

536
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,200
I don't know you.

537
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,930
All I know about you
is that you chose to work for Hunley.

538
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,526
Yeah. All I know about you
is you chose to resign.

539
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,443
You don't have to worry
about Ethan. They'll never catch him.

540
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,284
No, they're not gonna catch him. No.

541
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,761
This is the CIA.
This is Hunley we're talking about.

542
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,969
Things are out of control.
No, they're going to kill him.

543
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,611
They're going to kill Ethan.
They're going to kill Benji.

544
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,091
We have to get to them first.
Are you going to help me?

545
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,249
You need to understand something.

546
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,884
Ethan is my friend.

547
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,049
And if I have one second of doubt
whose side you're on...

548
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,326
Mmm?

549
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,165
I believe you.

550
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,769
- All right.
- All right.

551
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,887
What do I have to go on?

552
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,485
Not much. And not a lot of time.

553
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,445
<i>His name Solomon Lane.</i>

554
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,960
He created the Syndicate.

555
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,761
Where does he come from?

556
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,884
He's former British intelligence.

557
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,681
Well, if British intelligence knows
the Syndicate exists,

558
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,842
why don't they just tell the CIA?

559
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,684
Because they don't want
anyone knowing

560
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,730
the Syndicate was created
by one of their own.

561
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,331
I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trust

562
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,683
and eventually identify the members
of his organization.

563
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,924
And for the first time in two years,
I'm close to knowing who they are.

564
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,285
Lane had a ledger.

565
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,445
It contained the identities of
his operatives, his terrorist associates,

566
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,245
the entire inner workings
of the Syndicate.

567
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,369
One of his agents stole it,
hoping to blackmail him,

568
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,570
and kept it in a secure computer facility
for safekeeping.

569
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,371
He died being interrogated
for the access code,

570
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,169
leaving Lane with a serious problem.

571
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,886
So the key to crushing Lane

572
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,964
is sitting in a computer,
just waiting for someone to take it.

573
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,448
So, why hasn't Lane
just sent someone to steal it?

574
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,526
Oh, he has.

575
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,645
He sent me.

576
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,806
And I can tell you

577
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,811
it's impossible.

578
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,522
The facility's hidden beneath
a local power plant under military guard.

579
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,364
And the only way to download the ledger

580
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,324
is through the central
computer terminal, located there.

581
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,120
<i>To reach the terminal,
you'll need to pass the main gate,</i>

582
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,042
<i>access the elevator
with fingerprint recognition,</i>

583
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,320
<i>and open
three separate combination locks.</i>

584
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,169
<i>Well, that's easy.
We just impersonate the agent</i>

585
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,005
who stole the ledger in the first place,
and I get to wear a mask!

586
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,686
Unfortunately, even if you could
make it through

587
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,610
every other security measure,
you won't beat the last one.

588
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,281
<i>That's because it's protected
by gait analysis.</i>

589
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,567
<i>The step beyond facial recognition.</i>

590
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,206
<i>These cameras actually know
how the agent walks,</i>

591
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,884
<i>how he talks, how he moves.</i>

592
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,209
<i>Right down to his facial tics.</i>

593
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,120
<i>So, what you're saying is
no mask can beat it.</i>

594
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,440
We're busted before we even get
into the vault,

595
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,885
and I wind up in a Moroccan jail,

596
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,566
playing mummies and daddies
with Ahmad the Strangler.

597
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,210
Okay, I don't get to wear a mask.

598
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,364
And there's no other way
into the computer lab?

599
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,680
No other way in.

600
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,922
- Air shaft?
- Six-inch-diameter pipe.

601
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,040
Foundation?

602
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,889
Twelve feet of concrete, top and bottom.

603
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:13,847
- Electrical conduit.
- Electrical conduit.

604
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,604
Bottom line is there's no way
into that terminal

605
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,008
unless your profile is preinstalled
in the security system.

606
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,086
Profile.

607
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,160
Where are the profiles stored?

608
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,326
All security data is stored offline
in the liquid-cooled array.

609
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,922
Here, inside the torus.

610
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,441
Liquid-cooled.
You mean that thing is underwater?

611
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,046
- Yes.
- Yes.

612
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,327
Okay. So, to get the ledger,

613
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,165
<i>one of us needs to enter the torus</i>

614
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,842
<i>and change the security profile,</i>

615
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,844
<i>so that the other one can access
the computer without being caught.</i>

616
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,520
- That's the only way.
- That's the only way.

617
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,809
Can I get in through there?
What's that?

618
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:01,123
That's the service hatch.
It can only be opened from the inside.

619
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,040
If you try and open it from the outside,

620
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,209
you'd be hit with 70,000 gallons
of pressurized water.

621
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,406
Where does the water come from?

622
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,888
Desalinized seawater flows through
the intake, in the power plant.

623
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,009
And, before you ask, the system
is designed to shut down automatically

624
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,003
if any metal enters the intake.

625
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,561
No oxygen tanks.

626
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,131
All right.
Well, how long will it take to free swim

627
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,770
from the intake to the service hatch?

628
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,808
Two minutes,
with the current at full power.

629
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,040
Then you just have to hold your breath
for two minutes.

630
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,210
What about installing
the security profile?

631
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,408
Well, that's gonna be, like,
a minute, tops.

632
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,280
So I have to hold my breath
for three minutes.

633
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,641
You can do that.

634
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,842
What I think you're overlooking
is the physical exertion.

635
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,970
The more you exert yourself,
the faster you consume oxygen.

636
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,681
Don't worry about him, all right?
All he has to do is install the fake profile

637
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,242
before I get to the gait analysis.
You said it yourself, it's the only way.

638
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,209
That doesn't sound impossible.

639
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,530
Satellite overwatch
covering all seven continents.

640
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,241
DNA profiling, facial recognition,
drone surveillance, drone strikes.

641
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,966
So, how are we supposed to find
Ethan and Benji before they do?

642
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,091
I'm not even looking for them.
I'm looking for her.

643
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,531
What do you mean?

644
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,126
These sketches. What do you see?

645
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,721
Ethan's not exactly sure
who this guy is.

646
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,206
But this woman...

647
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,602
- He knows her.
- He trusts her.

648
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,960
I'm betting that if he's not already
with her, he's on his way.

649
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,565
Find her, find Ethan.

650
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,080
Tell me it's possible to pull
facial recognition off a sketch.

651
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,764
For mere mortals, no.

652
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,889
- For me, I could've done this at home.
- All right.

653
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,960
- How long is this gonna take?
- Found her.

654
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,562
CCTV picked her up
at the airport in Casablanca.

655
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,445
What the hell?

656
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,491
She's bad news.

657
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,961
Sorry.

658
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,720
Your card isn't working.

659
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,440
<i>Benji, we're in.</i>

660
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,361
One more time.
You'll have three minutes.

661
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,330
Two and a half minutes
to switch the security profile.

662
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,721
Thirty seconds to escape
through the service hatch.

663
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,283
Remember, conserve oxygen.

664
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,283
Don't move a muscle
if you don't have to.

665
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,684
I'm in the elevator.

666
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,926
That current will carry you
to the torus.

667
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,729
Once you're there, I'll shut it down.

668
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,406
Important note.
The profile is in slot 108.

669
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,802
And a slightly more important note.
If you haven't switched that profile

670
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,400
before I reach the gait analysis,
I'm dead.

671
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,331
Thank you, Benji.

672
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,086
What's the problem?

673
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,369
The cooling system's rebooting by itself.

674
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,921
All systems normal.

675
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,164
Cooling system's at full power.

676
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,368
No, no, no.

677
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,205
You're all right.

678
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,645
Oh, you're okay.

679
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,930
You see? What did I tell you?

680
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,771
Difficult? Absolutely. But certainly not...

681
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,525
Jesus. Is he all right? What happened?

682
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,731
Okay.

683
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,921
Here.

684
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,006
Hey.

685
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,685
I misjudged you.

686
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,602
Hey, man. You okay? How you doing?

687
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,280
Hey, buddy.

688
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,444
- Benji.
- Yeah, Benji. You did good.

689
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,082
You take a moment, all right?
Just take a moment.

690
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,731
There's nothing a little sunshine
and fresh air won't fix.

691
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,882
- You'll be right as rain.
- What are you doing here?

692
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,921
Look, look.

693
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,527
We got it.

694
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,525
I knew we'd get it.

695
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,450
Listen, I don't want to
sound ungrateful, okay?

696
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,488
I appreciate everything you do for me,

697
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,370
but one of these days,
you're going to take it too far.

698
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,245
We got it!

699
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,681
We're gonna nail that...

700
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,370
Wait, wait...

701
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,450
I thought you said
you could find him.

702
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,766
I said I could locate him.

703
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,649
- You have to find him.
- Right.

704
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,565
Where's Hunt?

705
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,001
He's dead.

706
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,765
That really hurts!

707
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,046
- Can you walk?
- Yes.

708
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,851
We have to get to
her before Lane does.

709
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,521
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

710
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,729
Are you okay to drive?
A minute ago you were dead.

711
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,446
What are you talking about?

712
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,005
This is not going to end well.

713
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,160
There she is!

714
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,851
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

715
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,849
Ah! God damn it!

716
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,601
Whoa.

717
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,041
We found him.

718
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:30,721
Oh, come on, man!

719
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,481
Shit!

720
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,086
It's a high-speed chase!

721
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,402
You just had to get the four-by-four,
didn't you?

722
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,165
- Don't blame me. You chose the car.
- You just had to have it!

723
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,561
- Do you want me to drive?
- Look at this thing!

724
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,520
Look how slow you're going.
Speed it up!

725
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,921
Who's this guy?

726
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,161
Shit!

727
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,641
Oh!

728
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,086
Ahhh!

729
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,561
Go! Go! Go!

730
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,290
I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay!

731
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:37,761
Whoa!

732
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,686
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

733
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,971
Here they come!
What are we gonna do?

734
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,081
Uh...

735
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:05,921
Gun!

736
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,166
- Do you have your seatbelt on?
- You're asking me that now?

737
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,685
Hang on!

738
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,481
We good?

739
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,567
Things got a little out of hand.

740
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,729
Ah! Look out!

741
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,086
We're good?

742
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,045
Oh, hey, boys, what did I miss?

743
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,360
Ooh, that looks sharp. Careful! Careful!

744
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,441
So what do we do now?

745
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,489
Please tell me
you made a copy of that disk.

746
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,048
Of course I made a copy.

747
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,485
So where are we going?

748
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,448
It's a ledger.
The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.

749
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,010
Who they are,
the politicians they control,

750
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,402
and where the money comes from.
It's everything you want to know.

751
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:15,087
What makes you think
this so-called ledger is authentic?

752
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,251
Why would Lane want it so badly
if it wasn't authentic?

753
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,482
Why would he ever
let you have it if it was?

754
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:24,088
Did you never stop to consider
that he may want me to have it?

755
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,646
Misinformation, manipulation,
it's what he does, Ilsa.

756
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,370
It's what he's trained to do.

757
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,569
Lane lies to you,
you sell these lies to Hunt.

758
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:34,803
Together, you're both compromised.
That's his ultimate objective.

759
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,040
This may be authentic.

760
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:41,844
But there's only one person I trust
to verify that information. You.

761
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,600
No.

762
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,044
My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate.

763
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,770
Your orders were
to infiltrate the Syndicate

764
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,003
that we may learn more
about them firsthand.

765
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,527
This isn't proof.
It's a test, like everything else.

766
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,001
The only way to pass is to go back.

767
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:04,170
I can't do that. I've betrayed Lane's trust
too many times.

768
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,720
And in every instance,
you did so on your own volition.

769
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,451
He was going to torture and kill
an American agent.

770
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,922
And you should have let him.
Then you would still have Lane's trust.

771
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,162
This is the trade. Hunt understands that.

772
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,686
I wasn't going to let him die.
He's our ally.

773
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,845
There are no allies in statecraft, Ilsa,
only common interests.

774
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,289
As it stands, Ethan Hunt is a man
without a country.

775
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:29,931
This makes killing him
decidedly less complicated.

776
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,683
Are you ordering me to kill Hunt?

777
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,081
Good God, no.
Nothing so crude as that. No.

778
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,845
Lane will order you.

779
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,205
And to regain his trust,

780
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,370
you will do it.

781
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,763
You sent me to do a job. I did it.

782
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,529
Now you bring me in!

783
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,285
Might I remind you,
you are without a country of your own?

784
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:00,323
The Director of the CIA called me,
inquiring about you personally.

785
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,727
Of course, to protect your cover,
I had to lie.

786
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,370
So, as far as the Americans
are concerned,

787
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,284
you're a rogue assassin,
a target of opportunity.

788
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:11,443
Precious few people know
about your true identity.

789
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,809
It would be unfortunate if we forgot.

790
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,806
You see, there really is no choice, Ilsa.

791
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,850
You're going back.

792
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,167
Glad to know you're still with us.

793
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,282
- What's happening?
- I can't open it.

794
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:47,247
- What do you mean, you can't open it?
- I mean I can't open it, ever.

795
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,924
That's a red box.

796
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,684
- A what?
- It's a red box.

797
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,320
The British government uses them
to transport state secrets.

798
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,320
- Doesn't sound good.
- Meaning it's triple-encrypted.

799
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,526
You're not getting into that thing

800
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,648
unless you have fingerprints,
retinal scan,

801
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:03,088
and a voice phrase spoken
by a specific individual.

802
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,168
The Prime Minister
of Great Britain himself.

803
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:06,401
Yes, him.

804
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,608
So what you're saying is
there is no ledger,

805
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:11,081
which means we have no proof
that the Syndicate even exists.

806
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,687
So we're back to square one,
only now we are all wanted by the CIA.

807
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,169
I'm so proud of us.

808
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,641
What I don't understand is
why is there a red box

809
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,206
sat in a private data vault in Morocco?

810
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,962
And why would Lane want it
if he can't open it?

811
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,930
If Lane wants it,
you can bet he has a plan to open it.

812
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,080
And we just helped him steal it.

813
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,970
He's going to take the Prime Minister.

814
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:40,364
Yes, he is. The question is how.

815
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,085
Well, we have to warn
the British government.

816
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,321
Yeah, MI6.

817
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:46,244
No, Brandt. Put down the phone.
Let's think about this for a minute.

818
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,322
We have a responsibility
to warn the British government

819
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,609
and not gamble
with the Prime Minister's life, Ethan,

820
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:56,129
just so you can beat the guy
that has beaten you at every turn.

821
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,124
Is that what you think this is?

822
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,001
Brandt?

823
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,410
Is that what you think this is?

824
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,082
I think right now you're incapable
of seeing that there is another way.

825
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:14,801
And sometimes Ethan is the only one
capable of seeing the only way.

826
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,123
And if he is wrong,
then we have Vienna all over again!

827
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,441
You don't know him.

828
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,524
If he wants something to happen,
there is no preventing it!

829
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,523
That's why we have to warn the British.

830
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,841
Maybe that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

831
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,321
Are you listening to yourself?
We are going to warn the British.

832
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,727
No. We're going to find Lane,
we're going to get him,

833
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,121
before he takes the Prime Minister.

834
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,281
Okay.

835
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,808
All right, Ethan.
We're going to find Lane.

836
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,444
But please tell me
how are we going to do that?

837
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,766
All is forgiven.

838
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,089
That isn't a ledger, is it?

839
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,124
You didn't take a look for yourself?

840
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,251
Of course I did,
but the file was encrypted.

841
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,410
And why would I lie to you?

842
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,488
So that I would lie to Hunt.

843
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,605
But he wouldn't have stolen it
if he knew what it was.

844
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,923
And you wouldn't have helped him.

845
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,604
What is actually on that disk?

846
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,969
I'll be honest with you
when you start being honest with me.

847
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,001
Now, you and I both know
why you've come back. Don't we?

848
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,841
Hmm?

849
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:04,925
You're still alive
because I believe in your potential.

850
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,889
But I'm growing impatient.

851
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,522
Why do you continue to resist?

852
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,487
Well, if we're being honest,
you're a terrorist.

853
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,486
If that were true,
my goal would be to spread fear.

854
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:25,724
But my method is far more surgical.

855
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,650
You kill innocent people.

856
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:33,124
I helped my government kill
many innocent people and more.

857
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,884
So much more.

858
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:38,042
Killing to keep things as they were.

859
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:41,650
And now I'm killing
to bring about change.

860
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,161
I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.

861
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,400
Ethan Hunt is a gambler.
And one day his luck will run out,

862
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,970
and thousands of innocent people
will pay the price.

863
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,842
Which one of us will be the villain then?

864
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,127
Nothing here. It's empty.

865
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,610
I'm interested to see who you blame

866
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,410
for what happens next.

867
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,121
So that's her?

868
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,606
That's her.

869
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:23,604
I have to say you sure can ride.

870
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,002
- Ethan...
- You were just doing your job.

871
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:31,920
That's all we're going to say about it.

872
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,730
Atlee said you would understand.

873
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,491
Atlee.
Your handler in British intelligence.

874
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,283
And he didn't bring you in,

875
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,690
even after you gave him the disk.

876
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,201
You knew perfectly well it was blank.

877
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,201
<i>That's a lie.</i>

878
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,760
The disk she took from me
was an exact copy. I'm sure of it.

879
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,207
Was it in your possession
the entire time?

880
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:13,131
They don't care if you live or die.

881
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,881
But you knew
I was going to take it to him.

882
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:26,849
I hoped you would.
I hoped it'd be enough to get you out.

883
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That means
Lane doesn't have the disk. Only we do.

884
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,401
I have a question.

885
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,962
If the disk was blank,
why is she still alive?

886
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,882
<i>Unless, of course,
Lane wanted us to find her.</i>

887
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,571
So who you working for now?

888
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,641
Lane, Atlee, your government,
my government, they're all the same.

889
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,964
We only think
we're fighting for the right side

890
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,929
because that's what
we choose to believe.

891
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,125
So where does that leave us?

892
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:59,086
The way I see it,
you have three choices.

893
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:02,649
One, you hand me
and the disk over to the CIA.

894
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,964
I am proof the Syndicate exists.

895
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:08,323
Lane becomes their problem
and your work is done.

896
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,562
- My thoughts exactly.
- Works for me.

897
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,800
But you know
they're not gonna believe you.

898
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,129
And you'll all be tried for treason.

899
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,041
Lane goes free.

900
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,090
I'm afraid she has a point.

901
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,648
Two, you let me walk away
to an uncertain fate.

902
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,331
You use the disk as bait to trap Lane.

903
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:30,244
But some part of you suspects
you've met your match.

904
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,051
And being a gambler, you'll probably
end up handing Lane that disk,

905
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,724
whether you want to or not.

906
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,970
That is entirely possible.

907
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,001
And option three?

908
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,131
Come away with me.

909
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,165
Right now.

910
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,130
Oh, boy.

911
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,006
And what about Lane?

912
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:56,130
Forget about Lane.

913
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:58,684
There will always be another Lane.

914
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,965
There will always be people like us
to face him.

915
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,163
We've done our part
and we've been cast aside.

916
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,162
We can be anyone.

917
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,682
We can do anything.

918
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,682
It's only a matter of going.

919
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:31,764
Lane sent you to deliver a message,
didn't he?

920
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,000
I've saved your life twice.
I won't be able to do it again.

921
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,170
What's the message?

922
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,361
Benji.

923
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,565
Parking garage.

924
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:07,290
Luther, stay with her!

925
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:33,722
She's gone. I lost her.

926
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,725
She set us up, Ethan.

927
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:41,403
No. She delivered a message.

928
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:44,370
She set us up!
She knew this would happen!

929
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:47,284
Only Lane knows
what's going to happen!

930
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,043
<i>I have a job for you, Ethan.</i>

931
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,805
<i>And for the sake of your friend,
you will do it.</i>

932
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,921
I'm listening.

933
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,049
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,</i>

934
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:05,727
<i>is to bring me the unlocked disk
by midnight tonight.</i>

935
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,450
<i>Now say the words, please.</i>

936
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,210
I accept.

937
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:12,361
Yes.

938
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,520
I knew you would.

939
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:28,648
He wants the disk, unlocked,
by midnight tonight.

940
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:33,169
Ethan, there's only one person on Earth
who can unlock that disk.

941
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:37,002
We have to take the Prime Minister.

942
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:40,482
Let's just think about that
for a minute.

943
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,241
It's the only way to get Benji back.

944
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:47,164
Ethan, that's exactly
what Lane wants you to do.

945
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,651
Which is why it has to happen.

946
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,329
This is how we beat Lane.

947
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:00,004
This is how we make everything right.

948
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,606
Can you see?

949
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,365
Can't you see it?

950
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,363
William Brandt, sir.
He says it's urgent.

951
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,442
I had a feeling
you'd come to your senses, Brandt.

952
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:31,121
I'm only calling you
because I have no other choice.

953
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,884
I'm trying to prevent a catastrophe.

954
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,883
<i>I can understand that. Where are you?</i>

955
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:40,204
- London.
- Reroute us to London now.

956
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,291
- Where in London?
<i>- I'll tell you when you land, not before.</i>

957
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,482
I'm not interested
in playing games, Brandt.

958
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,445
And I'm not interested
in seeing my friends get killed either.

959
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,921
So if I'm going to betray them,
we're going do this on my terms

960
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,809
and my terms only. Do you understand?

961
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,247
<i>Keep your phone on.
Instructions will follow.</i>

962
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,329
You should've been gone
by now.

963
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,401
Yeah.

964
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,131
You okay?

965
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,681
We're supposed to take down

966
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,480
the Prime Minister
of Great Britain tonight.

967
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:17,881
So...

968
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,087
Brandt?

969
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,040
I can't see another way.

970
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,891
Neither can I.

971
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,205
But we do what we have to do
for our friends, right?

972
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:22,486
Get him ready, please.

973
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,168
You were right to call me, Brandt.
Where is Hunt?

974
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,129
He's on his way.
We don't have much time.

975
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,965
- What does he intend to do?
- What matters is that he's alive.

976
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,010
And I need your reassurance
that he's going to stay that way.

977
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,844
Have you informed
the British government

978
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,809
that Hunt has targeted
the Prime Minister?

979
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:21,327
I will help you capture him alive.
That is the deal.

980
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,841
You've picked up some terrible habits
from your friend, Brandt,

981
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:34,447
the worst of them being that you still
believe you can control any outcome.

982
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,930
Stay with him.

983
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,161
Chief Atlee! Chief Atlee.

984
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:45,561
Director Hunley,
how delightful to see you here.

985
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:49,486
Last time we spoke, you were hunting
rogue agents in Morocco.

986
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:53,531
Chief Atlee, I have reason to believe that
the Prime Minister's life is in danger.

987
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:57,920
I'm listening.

988
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:04,762
Any advance
on 22,000? Anyone?

989
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:07,322
Going once. Going twice.

990
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:10,042
Sold to our generous chairwoman.

991
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:13,644
Sir? Chief Atlee from MI6
needs to see you.

992
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:15,250
He says it's urgent.

993
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,325
Excuse me.

994
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:30,250
What's this all about?

995
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,561
It's a matter of national security, sir.

996
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,651
Under no circumstances
is anyone to enter.

997
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:44,081
Yes, sir.

998
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:47,280
<i>Help me to understand.</i>

999
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:50,891
Who is this man?
Why is he after me?

1000
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:53,725
I'm afraid, Prime Minister,
Director Hunley and I

1001
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,041
share responsibility for this.

1002
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:59,124
Ethan Hunt was part of
a disgraced intelligence agency

1003
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:00,480
which has since been dissolved.

1004
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:01,851
And he's gone rogue,

1005
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,527
unfortunately intent on dismantling
an imaginary terror network.

1006
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,167
But new intelligence suggests
he's been manipulated

1007
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:10,083
by one of your own former agents.

1008
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:13,050
Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister.
She disappeared two years ago.

1009
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:16,926
If you don't mind my asking, what do
I have to do with this phantom network?

1010
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:20,084
Uh, sir, this is William Brandt,
a former colleague of Hunt's.

1011
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:23,323
He came forward with firsthand
knowledge of the plot against you.

1012
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:26,085
Sir, Hunt is in possession
of a virtual red box

1013
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,003
that can only be opened by you.

1014
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:31,527
He believes it is the key
to bring down the Syndicate.

1015
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,083
The Syndicate, you say?

1016
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:38,005
Yes, sir.
That's what he calls it.

1017
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,007
Atlee?

1018
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:43,240
He couldn't possibly be talking about

1019
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,686
that Syndicate.

1020
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,320
Because you assured me that
that Syndicate was merely an exercise.

1021
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,763
And it was, Prime Minister,
I can assure you.

1022
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:55,887
And yet here we have

1023
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:58,122
the Central Intelligence Agency
indicating otherwise.

1024
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,565
I don't understand.

1025
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:01,768
Prime Minister, your life is in danger.

1026
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,288
I think our first priority is to move you
to a secure location.

1027
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:08,250
Sir, does the name Solomon Lane
ring a bell?

1028
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,726
Yes.

1029
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:15,723
Unfortunately, it does.

1030
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,880
So there actually is a Syndicate?

1031
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:25,325
It was the hypothetical brainchild
of Chief Atlee.

1032
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:28,450
Recruit former agents
from other nations,

1033
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:29,885
supply them with a new identity,

1034
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:33,726
and use them to surgically remove
our enemies, both at home and abroad.

1035
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,801
Its operating budget
was to be hidden offshore

1036
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:39,924
in a virtual red box
which I alone would control.

1037
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,086
It would have made me
judge, jury, and executioner,

1038
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:44,400
with zero accountability.

1039
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,165
I rejected the proposal, unequivocally.

1040
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,925
Furthermore,
I was given every assurance

1041
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,843
it never passed the planning stage.

1042
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:54,491
Prime Minister, there is no Syndicate.

1043
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:57,081
These men have been duped
by Agent Faust.

1044
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:00,528
Atlee! Save it for the public inquiry.

1045
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,330
Sir, I urge you not to leave this room.

1046
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,606
- Excuse me.
- Please.

1047
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:06,561
Hunt is uniquely trained
and highly motivated.

1048
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:10,008
A specialist without equal,
immune to any countermeasures.

1049
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:12,361
There is no secret he cannot extract.

1050
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:15,762
No security he cannot breach.
No person he cannot become.

1051
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:20,242
He has, most likely,
anticipated this very conversation

1052
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,210
and is waiting to strike
in whatever direction we move.

1053
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:27,365
Sir, Hunt is the living manifestation
of destiny.

1054
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:30,046
And he has made you his mission.

1055
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,051
Prime Minister?

1056
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,161
Hunt.

1057
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,247
Sir, please step away
from the Prime Minister.

1058
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,641
Just relax, sir.
Everything's going to be all right.

1059
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:02,326
- Atlee shot me.
- Yes, he did, sir.

1060
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:08,320
Hunt, I hope you realize you've set back

1061
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,165
US-UK relations
to the American Revolution?

1062
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:14,411
Desperate times,
desperate measures, sir.

1063
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,041
I'm here.

1064
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:19,804
<i>- Stand by to receive.</i>
- Ready.

1065
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:28,840
The Prime Minister's office asked me
to meet him here.

1066
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:30,361
This way, sir.

1067
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:31,760
Scanning.

1068
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,648
Retinal scan confirmed.

1069
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:40,607
Mmm.

1070
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,444
It's okay. Here you go, sir.

1071
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:46,160
You've got a very warm hand.

1072
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,685
<i>Biometric confirmed.</i>

1073
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:01,042
The prompt is "Kipling."

1074
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:05,851
Sir, I'm going to need a pass-phrase.
The prompt is "Kipling."

1075
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,251
Yes, of course.

1076
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,848
"If you can keep your head when
all about you are losing theirs...

1077
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:19,528
<i>"If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you..."</i>

1078
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:26,049
- You got it?
<i>- I got it.</i>

1079
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:27,844
Oh, man, do I got it.

1080
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,570
I'm here to see the Prime Minister.

1081
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:31,370
We were told not to let anybody in.

1082
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,771
- By whom?
- By you, sir.

1083
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:40,768
Hunley? What is this?

1084
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,330
Security!

1085
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:50,286
Chief Atlee.

1086
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:52,523
Kind of you to accept our invitation.

1087
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:53,921
Ah.

1088
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:04,122
Do you know who I am?

1089
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:08,488
We know you created the Syndicate.

1090
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,927
But Lane went rogue
and turned it against you, didn't he?

1091
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,601
And you've been
desperately trying to cover it up.

1092
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,081
That's why you erased the disk
when she brought it to you.

1093
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:18,130
That's true.

1094
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:25,688
Now, Director Hunley has some
questions for you regarding Ilsa Faust.

1095
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,411
Namely, how you framed her.

1096
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,847
That's also true.

1097
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,045
It's the antidote.

1098
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,561
When the Prime Minister found out
about the Syndicate,

1099
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,290
Atlee attacked him.

1100
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,566
Yes, that's true.

1101
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:45,371
And then you saved
the Prime Minister, sir.

1102
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,726
Did he?

1103
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:48,481
I'm very grateful.

1104
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:00,966
Sir.

1105
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:06,280
You're cutting it very close, Ethan.

1106
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,161
I have what you want. Where do I go?

1107
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,729
Ethan, wait.

1108
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,928
If I'm not there in 15 minutes,
he'll kill Benji.

1109
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,889
The mission
is to bring down the Syndicate.

1110
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:38,170
If Lane gets his hands on that money,
we're unleashing a terrorist superpower.

1111
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:40,322
He'll never take me alive.
I'll make sure of it.

1112
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:44,041
And what happens,
Ethan, if you can't make it back?

1113
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:46,523
I'll make it back.

1114
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,091
Just be ready.

1115
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:55,530
<i>Greetings, Prime Minister.</i>

1116
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,806
<i>If you are viewing this message,</i>

1117
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,963
<i>it means that you have chosen
to activate the Syndicate.</i>

1118
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:03,726
<i>This disk gives you access
to £2.4 billion</i>

1119
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,325
<i>in untraceable currency</i>

1120
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:09,803
<i>that will allow the Syndicate
to operate undetected for decades.</i>

1121
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:14,569
<i>Instructions to access these funds
are as follows.</i>

1122
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:23,482
This is the end, Mr. Hunt.

1123
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,006
Careful.

1124
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,730
Two pounds of Semtex.

1125
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:42,687
Five hundred .30 caliber ball bearings.

1126
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:45,082
Your friend is sitting on
a highly sensitive...

1127
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:46,730
...pressure trigger.

1128
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,844
So no sudden moves.

1129
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:58,526
Your final test.

1130
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:02,446
When Lane has what he wants,
I kill you and Benji.

1131
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:06,602
If not, everyone dies.

1132
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,365
No time to think, Ethan.

1133
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,604
Have a seat, please.

1134
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:31,808
Human nature. My weapon of choice.

1135
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:35,967
From the moment I killed the young lady
in the record shop,

1136
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:38,850
- I knew you would...
- ...stop at nothing to catch me.

1137
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:41,562
I also knew Ilsa wouldn't have a choice.

1138
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:45,567
Whether she broke you
that night you met or let you go,

1139
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:47,883
whether you let her run in Morocco,

1140
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:51,081
whether she went to Atlee or not...

1141
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:55,251
You were certain we'd end up
where we are right now.

1142
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,924
Then, again,

1143
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:03,201
so was I.

1144
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,845
<i>I know you, Lane.</i>

1145
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,810
<i>Somewhere along the line,
you had a crisis of faith.</i>

1146
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:12,362
Human life didn't matter anymore.
Or maybe it never really did.

1147
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:15,889
Either way,
you killed too many innocent people

1148
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:20,090
without ever asking
who was giving the orders or why.

1149
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:24,445
<i>You blame the system for what you are,
instead of yourself.</i>

1150
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:28,961
You wanted revenge,
but Rome wasn't destroyed in a day.

1151
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:32,283
You needed help.
You needed money, a lot of it.

1152
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:35,764
And you'll stop at nothing to get it.

1153
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:38,686
That's how I know
I'm going to put you in a box.

1154
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,246
Where's the disk?

1155
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:45,291
Where is the disk?

1156
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:47,000
You like to play games.

1157
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:48,925
I have a game for you.

1158
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:52,843
I'll give you $50 million

1159
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,769
<i>to let Benji go.</i>

1160
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:14,611
Where is the disk?

1161
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:17,006
Where is the disk?

1162
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:19,605
You're looking at it.

1163
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:20,921
I am the disk.

1164
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:24,562
I memorized it.
All £2.4 billion in numbered accounts.

1165
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:26,882
If that vest goes off, you get nothing.

1166
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:31,488
<i>Without this money, you're nothing.
Without me, you're nothing.</i>

1167
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:38,003
<i>Right now, you're thinking it's a bluff.</i>

1168
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:39,930
<i>I'd never let my friends die.</i>

1169
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,288
<i>I couldn't possibly memorize
the entire disk.</i>

1170
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,329
There's only one way to be sure.

1171
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,165
Let Benji go.

1172
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:06,927
Take him.

1173
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,851
They come one step closer, shoot me.

1174
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:16,805
Stop!

1175
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:22,850
You remember I told you one day
you were going to take things too far?

1176
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,720
This is me speaking, by the way,
it's not him.

1177
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:29,681
The only way this ends is you and me,
Lane, face to face.

1178
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,685
<i>Only this time,
I won't be locked in a glass box.</i>

1179
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,211
<i>You want your money?</i>

1180
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:35,640
The Bone Doctor
is going to have to

1181
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:37,080
beat it out of me!

1182
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:40,371
Now let Benji go.

1183
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:47,083
1-3-9...

1184
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,085
- Go.
- Ethan...

1185
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:11,844
Brandt and Luther are waiting. Go.

1186
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:21,527
What do I do?

1187
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:23,001
Kill the woman.

1188
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:26,803
I need Hunt alive.

1189
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,289
- Go!
<i>- It's Benji. Where am I going?</i>

1190
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:17,885
- They're coming.
- We're not ready.

1191
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:19,086
Then get ready.

1192
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:47,085
Which way?

1193
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,923
Now let's see what you're made of.

1194
02:00:07,160 --> 02:00:10,846
Face to face, just as you wished, Ethan.

1195
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:35,810
It hurts, I know.

1196
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,651
Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane.

1197
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:43,331
Mr. Lane,

1198
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,843
meet the IMF.

1199
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:07,611
You're free now.

1200
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:12,205
Where will you go?

1201
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:14,886
I don't know.

1202
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:19,250
I've done my part.

1203
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:21,046
Yeah.

1204
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:27,931
Ethan, we got to go!

1205
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:39,609
You'd better hurry now.

1206
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,080
Good luck.

1207
02:02:58,280 --> 02:02:59,964
You know how to find me.

1208
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:19,171
Director Hunley?

1209
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:23,044
Director Hunley!

1210
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:24,360
Uh, Mr. Chairman.

1211
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:26,249
Six months ago,
you stood before this panel

1212
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:29,130
and demanded that
the IMF be dissolved.

1213
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:30,884
That is correct, sir.

1214
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:32,849
How do you explain
your testimony today?

1215
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:35,241
It's quite simple, really.
We had reason to believe that

1216
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:38,688
the Syndicate had infiltrated
our government at the highest level.

1217
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:41,331
In order for our man
to infiltrate that organization,

1218
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:44,244
his cover had to be absolute.

1219
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:45,481
The whole operation was known

1220
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:48,530
only to myself
and a handful of IMF agents.

1221
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:53,721
So the shuttering of the IMF
was all part of an elaborate scheme

1222
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,802
to expose the so-called Syndicate.

1223
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:57,201
That is correct, sir.

1224
02:03:57,280 --> 02:04:02,320
Which is why you're here today
asking for the IMF to be reinstated.

1225
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:04,404
That is correct, sir.

1226
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:09,930
I'm not sure the Committee approves
of your methods, Director Hunley.

1227
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:13,802
Uh, desperate times,
desperate measures, Mr. Chairman.

1228
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:19,526
And you, Mr. Brandt,
how can you justify this deception?

1229
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,243
I can neither confirm nor deny
details of any operation

1230
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:27,368
without the Secretary's approval.

1231
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:37,727
Welcome to the IMF,

1232
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:39,325
Mr. Secretary.

1233
02:04:40,305 --> 02:05:40,619
