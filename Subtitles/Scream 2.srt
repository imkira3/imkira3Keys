1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,902
---

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,900
SCREAM 2

3
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,900
I hate scary movies. I should
be studying. You know I got a bio due.

4
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,110
Baby, did I mention that
these tickets were free ?

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,070
Sandra Bullock is playing
right down the street.

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,870
Nobody wanna pay $7.50 see some Sandra
Bullock shit... unless she's naked.

7
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, but you will sit through
a movie called Stab ?

8
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:48,170
It's adrenaline, Maureen.
It's good to be scared.

9
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,170
It's primal.
You know what I'm sayin' ?

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,170
No, I'm gonna tell you
what it is, okay ?

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,930
It's a dumb-ass white movie
about some dumb-ass white girls...

12
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,050
gettin' their white asses
cut the fuck up, okay ?

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,810
Yeah. I suppose Sandra Bullock
is Miss Ethnicity, right ?

14
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,980
Well, no, all I'm saying is that
the horror genre is historical...

15
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,020
for excluding
the African-American element.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,570
When the hell you get your Ph.D.
in Black Cinema, Sister Souljah ?

17
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,570
Listen, I read my Entertainment Weekly,
okay ? I know my shit.

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,240
Yeah, Maureen. I read my
Black Beat, too, homey.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,030
Tonight we're going to have an
all-black movie, all-black cast,
all-black wardrobe, black eyes-

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,950
Everything.
Black-eyed peas. Black cats-

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,580
- Crazy.
- Thank you.

22
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,960
- Hi. Here you go.
- What's this ?

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,960
Stab souvenirs.
The studio send them.

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,510
Hah !
And it's white.

25
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,180
- Thanks.

26
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,390
Thank you.

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Kill ! Kill ! Kill !

28
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,860
Very romantic.

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,320
Whoa !

30
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,890
Whoo ! Take it off !

31
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,900
Now, why has she got
to be naked ?

32
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,150
What does that have to do with the plot
of the story, her being butt-ass naked ?

33
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,570
I don't know about the plot,
but I got a stiff one.

34
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,900
You better loosen up
that wrist.

35
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,340
Hello ?

36
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,390
Hello.

37
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,930
- Who is this ?
- Guess.

38
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,940
- No, really. Who is this ?
- Were you expecting somebody ?

39
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,810
- No.

40
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,030
Bitch, hang the phone up
and Star-69 his ass ! Damn !

41
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,240
- Shh !

42
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,950
- Who is this ?
- Who would you like it to be ?

43
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,080
I don't like games.
Who is this ?

44
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,370
Look out back.

45
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,130
You see your boyfriend
anywhere ?

46
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,710
I don't even have
a boyfriend right now.

47
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,210
Would you like one ?

48
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,550
Damn it all. Can l- Give me some money.
I need to get some popcorn.

49
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,850
- You got money.
- I asked for your money.

50
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,220
What do you say ?

51
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,560
Cheap ass.

52
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,150
- Thank you.
- Come on.

53
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,270
Cat got your tongue ?

54
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,650
You know, I don't even know you,
and I dislike you already.

55
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,370
Come on !

56
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,540
- Hey, we're sold out.
- Oh, cool !

57
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,220
Hello.

58
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,050
Hi. Um, can I have a medium popcorn,
no butter, and a small diet Pepsi ?

59
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,060
- You got it.
- Thanks.

60
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,060
That's it. I am not
going back in there.

61
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,310
Come on, you chickenshit.
It's just a movie.

62
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,560
No, it's not just a movie.
It's a true story.

63
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,820
All these kids got killed
a couple years ago in California.

64
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,480
- Here's the popcorn.
- Thanks.

65
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,070
I was so scared,
I almost had a heart attack.

66
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,950
Hah !
Stab you, man !

67
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,420
- Whoa !

68
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,010
- You ass !
- I'm sorry. I had to, baby.

69
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,260
- What are you playing ?
- Would you relax ?

70
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,260
God ! What's wrong with you ?

71
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,020
I don't like being scared.
I don't like that.

72
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,900
Baby, it's just
a movie.

73
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,860
Besides, scary movies
are great foreplay.

74
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,610
Excuse me ?

75
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,650
Let's go see
Sandra Bullock.

76
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,570
Oh, no. Sandra started already.
We can stay.

77
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,740
Just stop playin' so much.

78
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,170
All right. I gotta go
to the bathroom.

79
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,590
See ya inside.

80
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,530
Sorry.

81
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,290
Hello ?

82
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,900
No, no, no, no, no, no !
Don't do that !

83
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,080
Move ! Move !
Go !

84
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,080
All right, go !

85
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,380
Baby, give it up.

86
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,010
You came back just in time.
It looks like she's about to get it.

87
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,010
Want some popcorn ?

88
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,100
Uh-uh. See, if that was me,
I would be out of there.

89
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,240
Oh !
Here it comes !

90
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,410
- Here it comes !

91
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,580
Here it comes !
Oh, my God !

92
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,740
Whoa, oh, oh

93
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,290
This could be
your lucky day

94
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:57,130
In hell

95
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,220
- Never know who it might be

96
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,470
At your doorbell

97
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,100
This could be
your lucky day

98
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,600
In hell

99
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,730
In hell

100
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,110
Hello ?

101
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,570
- Hello ?
- Hello, Sidney.

102
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,490
- Yes ?
- What's your favorite scary movie ?

103
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,410
- Who is this ?
- You tell me.

104
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,840
Cory Gillis,
555-0176.

105
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,960
- Oh, shit !
- Hot flash, Cory-

106
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,970
- Shit !
- Crank calls are a criminal offense...

107
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,340
prosecuted under
penal code 653-M.

108
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,350
Hope you enjoyed
the movie.

109
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,520
Time to change
numbers again ?

110
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,520
No. It'll die off.

111
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,650
It's opening weekend.
We'll see how it goes.

112
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,650
Okay.

113
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,110
You know, Ron, uh,

114
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,110
it's not an easy thing to be accused
of a crime you didn't commit,

115
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,620
particularly one
as heinous as murder.

116
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,620
But how do people treat you
now that they know the truth...

117
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,620
- about your innocence ?
- Most people are cool.

118
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,620
There's some who still keep
a safe distance, which is odd for me,

119
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,880
'cause I've always been
sort of a people person.

120
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,380
But you were
wrongly accused !

121
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,380
You were fully exonerated.

122
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,130
Yeah, well, that and a nickel
will get you a cup of coffee.

123
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,800
- Even that's not true anymore.

124
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,890
Well, certainly, with Gale Weathers'
book- and now the movie-

125
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,720
- it's set the record straight
for Cotton Weary.
- One would think.

126
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,560
But, uh, Gale's-
Gale's been terrific.

127
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,140
Hey ! Move your ass, okay ?
You're late.

128
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,520
Don't forget about the martini mixer
tonight at the Delta Lambda Zetas.

129
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,990
- I don't think I'm going
to be able to make it, Hal.
- What ?

130
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,030
Don't even try to bag, okay ?
'Cause you promised me.

131
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,410
- A vague promise at best.
- Nobody's asking you to join, okay ?

132
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,580
It's a party.
Free beer, meet the girls.

133
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,580
Hallie, you know me
and organized religion.

134
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,000
- It's a sorority.
- Worse.

135
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,380
Look, Sid, just lower the walls
for the next few days.

136
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,710
This self-induced isolation
you got goin' is not healthy.

137
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,260
- I'm fine.
- "I'm fine."

138
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,390
Yes, I know. "I'm fine" is stretched
tightly across your face.

139
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,390
Check out the news.

140
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,610
The two Windsor College
students were murdered...

141
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,360
last night during a sneak preview
of the new movie Stab.

142
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,950
Police haven't released any information
except for the victims' names,

143
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,990
but a press conference is scheduled
for later today.

144
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,990
The victims, Maureen Evans
and Phil Stevens,

145
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,000
were both Windsor seniors.

146
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,540
- Where's Randy ?
- He's got Film Theory this morning.

147
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,630
...ended with the brutal murders
of two promising-

148
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,300
Sidney ! Sidney !

149
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,310
Sidney, did you know
the victims ?

150
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,310
-Do you feel threatened by the murders ?
-No comment.

151
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,310
-Do you think there'll be more murders ?
-Sidney ! Sidney !

152
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,600
-What can you tell us about the victims?
-How about the police?

153
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,520
- We just need one statement.
- Please talk to us !

154
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,990
You could say what happened in that
theater is a result of the movie itself.

155
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,160
That is so Moral Majority. You can't
blame real violence on entertainment.

156
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,620
What ? Wait a second. Yes, you can.
Don't you even watch the news ?

157
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,120
Yeah. Hello ! The murderer was wearing
a ghost mask, okay ?

158
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,500
Just like in the movie.
It's directly responsible.

159
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,290
No, it's not. Movies are not responsible
for our actions.

160
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,420
It's a classic case of life
imitating art imitating life.

161
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,880
This is not a hypothetical.
It's not about art.

162
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,590
I had Biology with that girl.
This is reality.

163
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,430
Thank you. I agree with you.
Let me tell you about reality, Mickey.

164
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,430
I lived through this.
Okay ?

165
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,600
Life is life.
It doesn't imitate anything.

166
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,980
Come on, Randy,
with all due respect,

167
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,690
the killer obviously patterned himself
after two serial killers...

168
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,900
- who have been immortalized on film.
- Thank you.

169
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,400
Are you suggesting that someone's trying
to make a real-life sequel ?

170
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,240
Stab 2 ? Who'd want to do that ?
Sequels suck.

171
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,240
- Oh, please. Please !

172
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,450
- By definition alone,
they're inferior films.
- Bullshit generalization.

173
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,620
Many sequels have
surpassed their original.

174
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,170
- Oh, yeah ?
- Name one.

175
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,750
Aliens. Far better
than the first.

176
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,710
Yeah, well, there's
no accounting for taste.

177
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,970
Thank you. Ridley Scott rules.
Name another.

178
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,390
No. Aliens is a classic, okay ?
"Get away from her, you bitch !"

179
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,140
Believe the line is "Stay away from her,
you bitch." It's film class, right ?

180
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,310
- Whatever. You know what I mean.
- Another.

181
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,900
- T2.
- Mmm.

182
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,690
You've got a hard-on
for Cameron.

183
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,820
- Big one.
- Wait a second.

184
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,740
- The first Terminator is historical.
- Yeah.

185
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,740
"Sarah Connor ?"
"Yes."

186
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,740
- All right. All right, okay.

187
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,120
House II:
The Second Story.

188
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,750
- What ?
- The entire horror genre
was destroyed by sequels.

189
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,130
Hey, I got it, by the way.
I got it.

190
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,290
The Godfather, Part ll.

191
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,880
Very good.
That's the Oscar-winning exception.

192
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,010
- All right, that's enough.

193
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,560
That'll be a wrap. The sequel discussion
to be continued.

194
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,230
So, Mr. Originality, how would
you make it different ?

195
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,730
I'd let the geek
get the girl.

196
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,240
Three hundred people watched.
Nobody did anything.

197
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,580
They thought it was a publicity stunt,
for Christ's sakes.

198
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,620
And it would have been a good one too.

199
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,620
- It's starting again, Randy.
- It's not.

200
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,920
Shit happens at the movies. People
get robbed, shot, maimed, murdered.

201
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,920
Multiplex is just a very dangerous place
to be these days.

202
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,130
Yeah, and you are
in extreme denial.

203
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,800
And you should be too.
This has nothing to do with us.

204
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,800
Randy, a guy in a ghost mask
hacked up two people...

205
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,510
in a movie theater
telling our life story.

206
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,350
- Coincidence ?
- You know what happened at Woodsboro.

207
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,860
- You can't ignore it.
- I know, Sid, but I don't
want to go back there again.

208
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,400
Can't we just go back to our
pseudo-quasi-happy existence ?

209
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,030
- Hello, Derek. How ya doin' ?
- Hey, Sid.

210
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,450
- I heard. You weren't in class.
- Yeah, I know.

211
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,160
I skipped. I couldn't take all
the "that's her" looks.

212
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,160
Is there anything
I can do ?

213
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,160
Well, you got any tricks
for getting me back...

214
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,040
to a pseudo-quasi-
happy existence ?

215
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,130
- I might just have one for that.
- Yeah ?

216
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,130
Oh, yeah ?
What is it ?

217
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,760
That was pretty good.

218
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,470
Get a room.

219
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,360
They're threatening to what ?
Are you kidding me ?

220
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,240
They'd be stupid
to pull this movie.

221
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,450
With all this free press, they're
gonna have huge numbers this weekend.

222
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,660
It'll break
box office records.

223
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,080
- Consider it done.

224
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,080
Uh, Miss Weathers ?
Hi. I'm Joel.

225
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,290
The affiliate sent me.
I'm your new cameraman.

226
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,340
- Yeah. You got experience ?
- Huh ? Uh, yeah.

227
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,710
I mean, I'm local,
but I shot the bingo finals.

228
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,720
- Great. Great.
- I almost got an award for that.

229
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,720
All right, listen, Joel.
This is how it works.

230
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,720
I point, you shoot.

231
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,060
You stay focussed and fast on your feet,
and we'll get along fine.

232
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,060
You're playing with the big boys now,
you got it ?

233
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,060
Got it ! Got you covered.
I'm all over it.

234
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,060
Don't worry about a thing.
How hard can it be ?

235
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,060
You point and I shoot.
I'm there !

236
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,150
Excuse me, Miss Weathers ?
Uh, could I have a minute ?

237
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,320
- No.
- Just one second.

238
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,320
I-l know you probably
get this all the time,

239
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,320
but I just wanted to say
I am such a big fan of your work.

240
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,740
I just finished you book.
I-l couldn't put it down.

241
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,080
Insightful, probing-
I just really, really loved your book.

242
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,040
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Sure.

243
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,040
I'm a writer myself.

244
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,040
I write for the local paper,
for the Post Telegram.

245
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,050
I'm Debbie Salt. I took your seminar
in Chicago last year.

246
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,260
I was the one in the front row asking
all the questions.

247
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,010
- Right. I thought you looked familiar.
- Oh, thank you.

248
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,100
Um, can't wait
to see the movie.

249
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,220
You know, you must be getting
quite a lot of flak on that, right ?

250
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,850
I mean, with all the
violence-in-cinema issues.

251
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,100
What is your position
going to be ?

252
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,110
- No comment.
- Miss Weathers, please- I would-

253
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,940
It would be an honor for me if I could
just get a quote from you for my story.

254
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,940
Okay. Begin quote:

255
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,740
- Great.
- "Your flattering remarks are
both desperate and obvious."

256
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,740
- Ouch !
- End quote.

257
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,740
Gale, what are you doing here ?
Do you think these murders are
connected to Sidney Prescott ?

258
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,750
Miss Weathers, what's your theory
on these murders ?

259
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,750
What's your feeling
about this ?

260
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,790
May I have your attention.

261
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,880
- My name is Chief Louis Hartley-
- Chief Hartley.

262
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,760
Hi. Gale Weathers,
author of The Woodsboro Murders.

263
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,880
Do you think the killer
will strike again ?

264
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,350
We have no evidence
that this is a serial killer.

265
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,350
- I'd like to read from a prepared-
- Can you tell us of any...

266
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,520
precautions
that you're taking ?

267
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,020
Well, first of all, we think it's just
an isolated incident,

268
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,650
- and we will be-
- Ladies.

269
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,650
Oh, my God.
This is huge.

270
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,820
Do you have
any suspects ?

271
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,490
- Sidney, look. It's Gale Weathers.
- What ?

272
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,530
Star of the Gale Weathers
press conference,

273
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,530
based on the book
by Gale Weathers.

274
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,660
Soon to be a major motion picture
starring Gale Weathers.

275
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,290
- Be kind. She saved our lives.
- She had calf implants.

276
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,290
Chief Hartley, do you plan
on giving the town a curfew ?

277
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,300
I'm gonna get closer.

278
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,840
- So that's her ?
- Yeah.

279
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,140
Hello, girls.
Enjoying yourselves ?

280
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,140
- Hello, Sister Lois, Sister Murphy.
- Hello, pledge. Hi, Sidney.

281
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,520
- Hey.
- This must be flat-out hell for you.

282
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,860
- How are you holding up ?
- I manage.

283
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,320
It's really weird, isn't it ? To think
this fuss is all because of you !

284
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,620
I mean, not directly, but in some
six-degrees-of-Kevin Bacon way.

285
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:33,910
Hallie, are you gonna bring your friend
to our little martini mixer tonight ?

286
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,420
- I have a lot of work to do.
- We'll be there.

287
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,420
Oh, good. Because Sid,
we have our eyes on you.

288
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,840
You hang in there, and if there's
anything we can do-

289
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,430
The Delta Lambdas are very sensitive
to your plight.

290
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,720
- Yeah. Bye !
- Bye !

291
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,560
- You gonna start to dress
like that once you get in ?
- That's not gonna happen.

292
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,650
The Delta Lambdas are the biggest
bunch of fuckin'-

293
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,480
Hey ! I'm pledging
Delta Lambda, thank you.

294
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,900
Oh, my God.

295
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,490
Who's that ?

296
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,450
Dewey ?

297
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,000
Hey !

298
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,380
- What are you doing here ?
- Ah !

299
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,260
- Oh, I was worried about you.
- Yeah ?

300
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,420
I heard about what happened
and I was on the next plane.

301
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,430
- Oh.
- Can we talk ?

302
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,430
Yeah. Yeah.

303
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,430
Are you okay ?

304
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,270
I'm fine, Dewey,
or I was.

305
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,110
I mean, things were okay
until now.

306
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,230
But, uh,
theater's going great.

307
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,530
I got my first starring role.
We open in two days.

308
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,820
- That is great.
- Yeah. I'm loving it.

309
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,820
You know, and I've got
some great friends,

310
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,410
and, uh,
I'm seeing someone.

311
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,540
Nice guy. Premed,
no apparent psychotic tendencies.

312
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,380
I was just worried.

313
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:08,300
Look, Sid, if there is some
freaked-out psycho trying to follow...

314
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,890
in Billy Loomis's footsteps,
you probably already know him.

315
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,390
Or her, or them.

316
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,350
They're probably
already in your life.

317
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,980
They get off on that.

318
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,900
I just want you
to be careful, Sid.

319
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:33,450
Oh, you- You think I don't
know that, Dewey ?

320
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,660
But what am I
supposed to do ?

321
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,040
Just cut everybody off ?
Crawl under a rock ? What ?

322
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,760
Just watch out.
Keep an eye out.

323
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,090
I'm gonna talk to Chief Hartley
and the local police.

324
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,260
I'm gonna
just hang around.

325
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,180
I wanna make sure you're safe,
if that's all right with you.

326
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,190
Yeah.
I'd be honored.

327
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,530
All right, Sid.

328
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,370
Hey.

329
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,370
Hey.

330
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,370
- You okay ?
- Uh-huh.

331
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,380
- Who was that guy ?
- An old friend.

332
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,750
Deputy Dewey, Woodsboro's finest.
What's he doing here ?

333
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,760
He's worried.
Our surrogate big brother.

334
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,590
Nothing like a funeral to bring
the family together.

335
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,180
I'm gonna go say hi.

336
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,220
- Chief Hartley said the girl
was stabbed seven-
- Drop it.

337
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,230
Hello, Sidney.

338
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,980
- How are you ?
- Hi. What do you want, Gale ?

339
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,570
Well, I was hoping I might get
just a few words with you.

340
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,320
- Cotton.
- Hi, Sidney.

341
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,660
Here we are at Windsor College,
where Sidney Prescott...

342
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,410
has just been reunited with Cotton Weary
for the first time...

343
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,000
since she wrongly accused
him of murdering her mother.

344
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,920
- What the hell are you doing ?
- We want to know how you feel.

345
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,630
Tell us everything that's happened,
looking back on the last two years.

346
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,090
Sidney, I'd just like to say
that I forgive and forget,

347
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,260
and just like you, I'd like to get
back on with my own life.

348
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,890
- Do you have any comments ?
- You bitch !

349
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,100
- Ah-ah.
- Deep breaths. Lot of deep breaths.

350
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,850
Oh, Sidney,
share with us, please !

351
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,190
- I'll share with you !
- Okay, okay, okay.

352
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,230
Did you get that
on film ?

353
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,060
Yes, I got that
on film.

354
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,400
Sid ? Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

355
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,030
Where's she going, Gale ?
Sidney ?

356
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,200
Where's she going ?

357
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,200
Gale, l-l thought we had
an official interview.

358
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,450
What's going on ?
She didn't know ?

359
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,580
- Man, that was cold.
- Hey, you need to check your
conscience at the door, sweetie.

360
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,580
I'm not here
to be loved.

361
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,580
Gale, you promised me ten minutes
of national coverage.

362
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,590
You'll get
your ten minutes...

363
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,710
when I get
my goddamn interview.

364
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,130
Don't walk away from me, Gale.
I'm still-

365
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,680
Gale, I did my part !

366
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,680
Joel !

367
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,270
Dewey.

368
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,270
What are you
doing here ?

369
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,480
Why don't you just
leave her alone ?

370
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,690
Hasn't she been
through enough ?

371
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,240
And my name is Dwight.

372
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,660
I was just doing my job,
Dwight.

373
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,410
-No matter who gets hurt in the process?
-Hey!

374
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,660
Who got punched here-
again ?

375
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,420
Well, I don't condone violence,
but maybe you deserved it.

376
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,380
Page 32: "Deputy Dewey
filled the room...

377
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,630
with his Barney Fife-ish
presence."

378
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,050
You read my book.

379
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,220
Oh, yes, I do read,
Miss Weathers.

380
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,270
Oh, Dewey, don't take it so seriously.
It's a character in a book.

381
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,020
Page 41:

382
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,150
"Deputy Dewey oozed
with inexperience."

383
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,490
Don't you think you're overreacting
just a little bit ?

384
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:01,160
No. What I think is that you're
a money-hungry, fame-seeking-
and forgive me for saying-

385
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,410
mediocre writer who's got a cold storage
shed where her heart should be.

386
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,620
No offense intended.

387
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,630
Dewey, I never meant
to imply-

388
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,750
How do you know that my
dimwitted inexperience isn't...

389
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,550
merely a subtle form of manipulation
used to lower people's expectations,

390
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:20,840
enhancing my ability to effectively
maneuver within any given situation ?

391
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,980
I'm sorry.

392
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,400
I don't know
what else to say...

393
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,660
except I'm sorry.

394
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,330
No. I'm the one
that's sorry.

395
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,490
I misjudged you.

396
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,250
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

397
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,920
I have some oozing to do.

398
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,090
One more thing.

399
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,090
Nice streaks.

400
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,260
Well.

401
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,020
Hey, I am not
a sorority pusher.

402
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,030
I just think,
despite its trivialities,

403
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,450
it is a life-affirming, mentally stable,
healthy environment for you.

404
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,450
I mean,
look at this place.

405
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,410
I think you're taking your psych major
a little too seriously, Hallie.

406
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,710
I'm fine.

407
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,330
Yeah ? That's beginning
to become your theme song.

408
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,790
"I'm fine." Yeah- Fucked up,
insecure, neurotic and emotional.

409
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,920
Sidney, you made it !

410
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,970
Hi !
No, I really mean that.

411
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

412
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,050
Do you girls
want a drink ?

413
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,930
Uh, well, actually, yeah, but
you know what ? We'll get it ourselves.

414
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,610
I love those guys.
Are they still together ?

415
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,610
I haven't seen it
in, like, three weeks.

416
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,620
- No, they broke up again.
- Really ?

417
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,620
Mm-hmm. Sarah found out
that Bailey slept with Gwen.

418
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,660
She dumped him, like,
two episodes ago.

419
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,660
I wish she'd get
her shit together.

420
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,710
- Hold on. Someone's calling.

421
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,710
Omega Beta Zeta.

422
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,710
Hello ?

423
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,420
- Yes ?
- Who is this ?

424
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,470
- Cici. Who's this ?
- Who do you think ?

425
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,970
Ted ?
Where are you ?

426
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,770
Are you drinking ?
Hold on.

427
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,520
Ted's on the other line.
He sounds drunk. I'll call you back.

428
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,690
That shit only calls you
when he's drunk.

429
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,690
- Don't go over there, Cici.
- All right. I'll call you back.

430
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,610
Okay, Ted. You sound loaded.
What's up ?

431
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,660
Who's Ted ?

432
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,200
Oh, I'm sorry.
My bad.

433
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,200
I thought you were
someone else.

434
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,210
That's okay.
I am.

435
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,750
Who are you calling for ?
Nobody's here.

436
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,750
Where is everybody ?

437
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,090
We're cosponsoring the acid rain mixer
at Phi Gamma Alpha tonight.

438
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,010
- Why aren't you there ?
- I'm "sober sister."

439
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,760
I need to be here in case
a drunk sister calls and needs a ride.

440
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,180
- That's too bad.
- "Drink with your brain."
That's our motto.

441
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,180
- Who are you calling for ?
- What if I said you ?

442
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,480
What if I said good-bye ?

443
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,650
Why would you
want to do that ?

444
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,320
- Why do you always answer
a question with a question ?
- I'm inquisitive.

445
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,240
Yeah, and I'm impatient. Do you want
to leave a message for someone ?

446
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,410
Do you want to die
tonight, Cici ?

447
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,920
Omega Beta Zeta.

448
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,920
So, was it Teddy ?

449
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,720
No. It was some creep asshole
trying to scare me.

450
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,090
That movie Stab is
bringing out the crazies.

451
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,430
- Shit.
- What is it ?

452
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,480
- I heard a noise.
- Where ?

453
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,520
Upstairs.

454
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,770
- Shit !

455
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,360
- Hello ? Hello ?
- Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

456
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,490
- Die, die, die, die, die. - Stop it !

457
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:12,030
I can't believe you're alone
in that house.

458
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,040
- I don't think I'm alone.

459
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,410
I'm out of here.

460
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,260
You're breaking up.
Where are you ?

461
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,050
- Outside.
- Don't panic, Cici.

462
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,050
- Call campus security.
- Okay.

463
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,020
Campus Security.

464
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,940
- Hi. I'm calling from the Omega Beta-
- I can't hear you. Hello ?

465
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,230
Hello ?

466
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,900
- Can you hear me now ?
- Hello ?

467
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,160
- Hello ? Shit !

468
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,950
- Campus Security.
- Yes. I'm calling from-

469
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,080
I can't hear you.
Hello ?

470
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,330
-I'm calling from Omega Beta Zeta house.

471
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,340
Look, someone
is harassing me.

472
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,340
- Hello ? Shit !

473
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,340
- Hey !

474
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,590
- Jesus, Dawnie, you scared me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

475
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,640
Did anyone call for me ?

476
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,270
- What are you doing here ?
- I live here, remember ?

477
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,600
I just thought you were
going to the mixer.

478
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,560
Yeah, I am. I had to change,
so I'll be out of here now.

479
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,030
Omega Beta Zeta.

480
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,610
- Is Cici there ?
- Mm-hmm. Who's calling ?

481
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,570
- It's Ted.
- It's your ill-conceived boyfriend.

482
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,740
Okay, so, I'll
see you later.

483
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,200
And don't forget
to set the alarm.

484
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,210
Bye.

485
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,840
Hello, Ted.

486
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,590
Wish it was Ted. Don't forget
to set the alarm.

487
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,810
Hello ?

488
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,020
No ! Please, no !

489
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,980
- No !

490
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,690
Never said I was innocent

491
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:16,070
I will burn in hell
for the things I've done to you

492
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,110
Never said
I was anything good

493
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,000
Everyone thinks that sororities
are just about blow jobs,

494
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,170
- but it's not true.
- We only promote safe, condomed sex.

495
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,960
See, we're about love,
respect and responsibility.

496
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,260
Harmonica style
is okay, right ?

497
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,260
- Oh, yeah.
- Cocktail ?

498
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,430
What took you so long ?

499
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,850
And you know, Derek is
a Delta Lambda big brother.

500
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,720
And we like to keep it
all in the family.

501
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,230
Wow. You know, you girls have
really given me a lot to think about.

502
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,230
Thanks.

503
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,480
It's working.
It's working.

504
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,280
- Hey, babe. You wanna dance ?
- Oh, I'd love to...

505
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,990
with that tall, wide-shouldered
fraternity boy.

506
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,030
- Think you can arrange that ?
- That hurts.

507
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,330
The Empire Strikes Back. It
was a better story, improved effects.

508
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,830
Not a sequel. It was part of a trilogy.
Completely planned.

509
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,830
I like those
little furry things.

510
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,840
They're Ewoks.
They blow.

511
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,840
Hey.

512
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,840
- How ya doin' ?
- Good.

513
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,840
- Twits being nice to you ?
- Painfully nice.

514
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,850
I take it you will not be pledging
Delta Lambda Zeta.

515
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,390
I think not.

516
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,020
- I'm crushed.
- Hey, guys.

517
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,060
Something is up
at Omega Beta Zeta.

518
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,860
- Police are everywhere.
- Hurry !

519
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,190
Come on, let's go !

520
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,920
- Way to break up the party !
- Shit !

521
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,920
I should have brought
my drink.

522
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,100
Death by blunt trauma,
and there's a double stabbing.

523
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,850
So it's definitely
not suicide.

524
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,890
Okay.
Thank you.

525
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,070
Gale, hi. You're just getting here.
It's not good.

526
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,240
It's a single victim:
sorority girl.

527
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,410
So- I gotta go.
I've got a deadline.

528
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,460
- Joel, let's go.
- In-In a minute.

529
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,000
It's happening again,
isn't it ?

530
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,000
You'd love that,
wouldn't you ?

531
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,050
- Please, stay back.

532
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,510
Better hurry, Gale.
Might get scooped.

533
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,510
Come on, I'm just trying
to get close enough...

534
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,890
- to get a shot.
- Move it, Joel.

535
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:52,600
Gale, I have to be honest with you.
I'm not cut out for this.

536
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,690
I mean, I was brought here to do
an interview, not Faces of Death 14.

537
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,860
Do not fuck with me.

538
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,290
Come on.
Get your jacket.

539
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,290
Let's get you home.

540
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,290
Yeah.

541
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,120
- You about ready ?

542
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,130
Almost.

543
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,340
- Hello ?
- Hello, Sidney.

544
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,590
Remember me ?

545
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,680
- What do you want ?
- I want you. It's show time.

546
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,600
Then why don't you show your face,
you fucking coward.

547
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,600
- My pleasure.

548
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,440
Derek !

549
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,900
- Sid ? Sid ?

550
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,740
Derek !

551
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,240
- Sid ?

552
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,490
Sid !

553
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,720
- It's me. It's me.

554
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,760
- You okay ? You okay ?
- Yeah. Yeah.

555
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,890
No, Derek !
Don't !

556
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,930
Sid !

557
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,940
Dewey !

558
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,940
- The killer's in there. And Derek.

559
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,040
- You all right ?
- He went that way.

560
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,250
Sidney, he's in here !

561
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,880
Is everything okay ?

562
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:33,470
He got me. He got me.

563
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,930
- Now, apply pressure to it.
- Don't do that-

564
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,570
The police are on their way.

565
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,200
Thanks for your cooperation.

566
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,450
Hallie, I'll be with you
in a few minutes, okay ?

567
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,870
Uh, no problem.

568
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,090
That's the easiest interrogation
of my crime-filled life.

569
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,130
I'm gonna go get a quick cup of coffee.
You want ?

570
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,590
No.

571
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,590
You want some, Sid ?

572
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,350
How you doin' ?
You all right ?

573
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,350
Not at all.

574
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,360
You know, I knew
this was coming.

575
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,780
- I knew this wasn't over.
- You are not alone, Sid.

576
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,530
Okay ?
We are all here for you.

577
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,700
All right ?
Whatever you need.

578
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,370
- That poor girl.
- I know.

579
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,540
It's crazy, but-

580
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,460
- Derek could've been killed, you know.
- But he wasn't.

581
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,420
He's fine.
He just needs to realize...

582
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,880
the '90s is no time
to play hero.

583
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,890
Why would anyone go back
in that house anyway ?

584
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:02,430
I went around to the back of the house
and ran into Sid there.

585
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,560
That's when she told me the killer
was inside, so I went in to see.

586
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:08,730
- You're lucky there's no nerve damage.

587
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,360
You're gonna have
to take it easy though.

588
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,490
- So then
you went back inside the house ?
- Yeah.

589
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,410
No struggle ? He just cut you
and ran away ?

590
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:22,830
- You're lucky he didn't kill you.
- Yeah, it's awfully convenient.

591
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,880
- Say what ?
- Nothing.

592
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,960
It's just a shame
he got away so easily.

593
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,710
It's just a shame
you got there too late,

594
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,010
right after he disappeared.

595
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,930
Yeah, it is.

596
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,370
We got three victims.

597
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:06,000
Maureen Evans,
Phil Stevens...

598
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,880
and Cici Cooper.

599
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,460
- Is Cici the girl's real name ?
- Oh, uh, no.

600
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,380
It's, uh, Casey.
Casey Cooper.

601
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,600
As in Casey Becker ?

602
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,770
- Excuse me ?
- She was a young victim in Woodsboro.

603
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:28,810
As well as her boyfriend,
Steven Orth.

604
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,940
As in Phil Stevens.

605
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,820
Maureen Evans- Maureen Prescott.
That's Sidney's mother.

606
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,860
Do you think someone's
trying to duplicate Woodsboro ?

607
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,320
It looks like it.

608
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,160
I think you have a copycat
on your hands, Chief.

609
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,710
Jesus Christ !

610
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,750
What are you doing
to keep Sidney safe ?

611
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:53,050
I got my two best
detectives guarding her.

612
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,510
Do these guys have to follow
you around everywhere ?

613
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,090
Oh. We're attached
at the hip.

614
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,850
- How am I ever gonna get you alone ?

615
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,850
- You know, to be honest, Derek,

616
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:09,310
I think it would probably be
in your best interest to...

617
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:12,190
stay as far away
from me as possible.

618
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,030
I hope that was an
off-the-cuff remark...

619
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:19,360
that holds no
subtext whatsoever.

620
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:23,370
No, actually.
I mean it.

621
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,420
I mean, look at you.
You already got hurt.

622
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,290
I don't want to see
that happen again.

623
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,300
I'll take my chances.

624
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,340
Derek, I'm serious.

625
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,720
This is serious.

626
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,060
You are concerned with my
personal well-being and...

627
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:53,270
not with trusting me
or anything, right ?

628
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,240
Like I said, I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

629
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,910
And I don't want
to see you get hurt.

630
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,910
Okay, Sid ?

631
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
- Take care, Miss Weathers.
- All right.

632
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,300
- Dewey.
- Chief.

633
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,470
Hi.

634
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,020
So, I'm heading over to admissions
to do some leg work. You game ?

635
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,690
I'm not here to write
a book, Miss Weathers.

636
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:35,690
I'm here to help Sid.

637
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,440
I want to help her, too.

638
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,490
And help myself,
of course.

639
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:49,750
Come on, Dewey. Smile just once.
Please ?

640
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,500
I'll smile when
I catch the killer.

641
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,000
Gale, hi. So who
do you think did it ?

642
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,510
What about Sidney's father ?
Has he been ruled out as a suspect ?

643
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,510
Well, he's supposedly out of the country
on business,

644
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,510
but that sounds a little fishy,
don't you think ?

645
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:08,720
-I'm not here to do your job, Miss Salt.
-What about this ex-cop, Dewey ?

646
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,140
-It's kind of strange that he showed up.
-Yeah, what's he doing here ?

647
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,440
Dewey's a good guy,
unlike some of us.

648
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,980
Really ?

649
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,610
Well, it just seems to me that
if the killer is repeating...

650
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,700
what happened in Woodsboro,
it's quite possible that the killer...

651
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,700
could be from Woodsboro.

652
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,700
That's all.

653
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,620
Derek, you think Sid will let me
interview her for my documentary ?

654
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,130
Oh, yeah. You know, she turned down
Primetime Live, 20/20 and Dateline.

655
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:40,750
- But for you, yeah.
- Drop it.

656
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,260
I've been thinking about
this whole murder thing.

657
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,510
- Have they checked out Randy ?
- What ?

658
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:48,800
I know he's an innocent victim the first
time around, but he's a little off.

659
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:52,640
- You know what I'm saying ?
- Come on. Randy ? The guy's harmless.

660
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,190
- That's what they said about Dahmer.
- Guys, keep it down.

661
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,310
Come on.
What's up, Sid ?

662
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,270
- Hey, Sid.
- How's it goin' ?

663
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,360
Where are
the Secret Service guys ?

664
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,360
Uh, over there.

665
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,950
And which one
is Kevin Costner ?

666
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,910
The one on the right
is Officer Richards.

667
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:14,120
He is a Capricorn.
Divorced. Father of two.

668
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,750
And the one on the left
is Officer Andrews. He is a Gemini.

669
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,040
He's single,
but I think he's gay.

670
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,590
- Really ?
- Mm-hmm.

671
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,720
Derek ?
Penny for your thoughts.

672
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,850
"This morning, I woke up
with this feeling...

673
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,890
I didn't know
how to deal with."

674
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,610
And so I just
decided to myself

675
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,190
I'd hide it to myself

676
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:44,230
- What is he doing ?

677
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,360
Uh, Tom Cruise,
Top Gun, 1986.

678
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,410
- Derek, don't.
- When you walked into the room

679
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,740
- I think I love you
- Don't do this.

680
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:57,000
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of

681
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,580
And though
it worries me to say

682
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,590
- I've never felt this way, hey

683
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:08,010
I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of

684
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:11,930
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for

685
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,140
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of

686
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,440
- And though it worries me to say

687
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,610
- I've never felt this way

688
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:26,110
Believe me
You really don't have to worry

689
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,400
I only wanna
make you happy

690
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,660
And if you say
"Hey, go away"

691
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,620
I will
But I think better still

692
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,120
I better stick around
and love you

693
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,540
Do you think I have a case
Let me ask you to your face

694
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,790
Do you really love me
'Cause I think

695
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,800
I love you

696
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,060
Let's show
a little love, huh ?

697
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,860
Come on.
Come here, come here.

698
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,120
Don't worry, Sid.
I know things are a little crazy.

699
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,870
Isn't that a big
frat faux pas ?

700
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,920
Oh, yeah.
That is a big no-no.

701
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,460
See, you're not supposed to give
your Greek letters to your girl...

702
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,510
no shape, way or form.

703
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,510
The brothers are gonna kick his ass,
but it's tradition.

704
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,050
- It's tradition.
- It's good luck.

705
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,180
It'll protect you.

706
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,910
So, tell us about this part
you're getting rave reviews for.

707
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,450
Well, I play this young girl,
Sidney Prescott,

708
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:00,000
who discovers that her boyfriend
is this crazy serial killer...

709
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,120
who also killed her mother
the year before that.

710
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,290
So what kind of research
did you do for the part ?

711
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:07,500
I don't get it. They get
Tori Spelling to play Sid,

712
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:10,050
and they cast Joe Blow Nobody
to play me.

713
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,840
- At least you get David Schwimmer.

714
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,010
I get the guy who drove
Jane Seymore's stagecoach...

715
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,800
for one episode
of Doctor Quinn.

716
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,100
This is Tori Spelling
starring in the new film Stab.

717
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,650
Billy, you scared me.

718
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,820
- What are you doing here ?
- They let me go, Sid. I didn't do it.

719
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,160
- I'm innocent.
- I know.

720
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,910
- Please.
- Why won't you let me touch you ?

721
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:44,500
Look, I've been going through a lot
lately, Billy. And with my mom-

722
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,540
Sid, I think you need
to just deal with that and move on.

723
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:51,170
I mean, when my mom
left my dad, I accepted it.

724
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,840
That's the way
the cookie crumbles. Moms leave.

725
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:59,560
Yeah, your mom left town. She's not
buried in the cemetery somewhere.

726
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,720
My mom's dead, and she's
never coming back. Ever.

727
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,310
- Stupid.
- Ooh, I love scary movies.

728
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,190
I'll wait for video. Okay,
let's get down to business.

729
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,320
The way I see it,
someone's out to make a sequel.

730
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,490
You know, cash in on all
the movie murder hoopla.

731
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:19,370
So it's our job to observe
the rules of the sequel.

732
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:22,040
Number one: the body count
is always bigger.

733
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,580
Two: the death scenes are always much
more elaborate; more blood, more gore.

734
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,540
Carnage candy. Your core audience
just expects it.

735
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:33,630
And three: if you want your sequel
to become a franchise, never ever-

736
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:35,970
How do we find the killer, Randy ?
That's what I wanna know.

737
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,590
Oh. Let's look
at the suspects.

738
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,930
There's Derek, the obvious boyfriend.
Hello, Billy Loomis.

739
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,350
The guy's premed, and his
pity-me surface wound...

740
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:47,140
conveniently missed every major vein
and artery.

741
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,560
- So you think it's Derek ?
- Not so fast.

742
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,980
Let's assume the killer,
or 'ers, has a half a brain.

743
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:55,320
He's not a Nick At Night
rerun type of guy.

744
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,320
He wants to break
some new ground.

745
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,570
- Right ? So forget the boyfriend.
- Right.

746
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,080
- It's tired. Who else do we got ?
- There's-

747
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,000
Mickey, the freaky
Tarantino film student.

748
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:10,380
But if he's a suspect, so am l.
So, let's move on.

749
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,380
Whoa, wait a-
Let's not move on.

750
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,010
Maybe you are a suspect.

751
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,800
Well, if I'm a suspect,
you're a suspect.

752
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,890
You have a point.

753
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,520
Okay, let's move on to-

754
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,730
- Hallie.
- Sid's roommate ?

755
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:30,850
- Uh-huh.
- Serial killers
are typically white males.

756
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,570
That's why it's perfect. It's sort of
against the rules, but not really.

757
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,570
Mrs. Voorhees was
a terrific serial killer.

758
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,910
And there's always room
for Candyman's daughter.

759
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,740
She's sweet. She's deadly.
She's bad for your teeth.

760
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:48,540
Come on, Randy.
These kids are your friends.

761
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,960
Who do you think's
the killer ?

762
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,340
- How about Gale Weathers ?
- Gale ? A killer ?

763
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,470
- Why not ?
- Well, she is vicious enough.

764
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,930
- She's an opportunist.
- Yeah.

765
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:03,350
Isn't it conceivable
she's planning her next book ?

766
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:06,930
That's what reporters do, Dewey.
They stage the news.

767
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,940
No. Gale's a lot of things,
but Gale's not a killer.

768
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,770
- Just because you're sweet on her-
- No, I'm not.

769
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,860
Please, this is me talking.
Randy,

770
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,320
the unrequited love-slave
of Sidney Prescott.

771
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,990
I know all
about obsession...

772
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,990
and pain.

773
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:25,450
- You've got your love scar to prove it.
- And so do you.

774
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,500
And what's with that limp anyway,
'cause you were stabbed in the back.

775
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,120
Severed nerve.
Look, Gale's no killer.

776
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,880
Okay, okay.
Whatever you say.

777
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,130
But if she's not a killer,
she's a target.

778
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,300
Joel, let's get
some establishing shots.

779
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,390
Um, Gale,
can we talk for a sec ?

780
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,810
- What is it ?
- Look, I'm a little confused here.

781
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:49,930
I mean, with your
given track record,

782
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,140
why would you wanna be here
when the killer strikes again ?

783
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,610
I mean, granted, I should've read
your book before I took this job.

784
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,820
But I'm reading it now,
and- Whoo !

785
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,860
I read what happened
to your last cameraman.

786
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,610
The guy got gutted.
Now, me,

787
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,740
I'm gonna do what any
rational human being would do,

788
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,780
which is get the fuck
out of here.

789
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,080
First of all, he wasn't gutted.
I made that up.

790
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,120
His throat was slashed.

791
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,250
What are you-
Gale, gutted, slashed,

792
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:15,290
the guy ain't in
the union no more.

793
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,290
It's a job, Joel.

794
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,590
And like every job,
there's a few drawbacks.

795
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:23,220
But you're a professional cameraman.
You've got to act like one.

796
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,720
Yeah, but I wanna report the news.
I don't wanna be the news.

797
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,560
Besides, brothers don't last long
in situations like this.

798
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,480
This is national television.
Think about it.

799
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,480
This is a big chance
for you.

800
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,360
The story is monumental.
Don't you wanna be a part of that ?

801
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,190
Come on.

802
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,740
I need you.
I cannot do this without you.

803
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,660
Good.
Come on.

804
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,040
- Let's get some work done.
- Yeah, let's go get killed.

805
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:59,000
We've been through this before.
You know what I think about
your potential as an actress.

806
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,960
I know.
I know.

807
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:04,130
It-It's just that with,
um, the murders...

808
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:07,590
and the movie
and my life-

809
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,390
I do know how difficult
it is for you.

810
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,810
Gus, l-l just-
I don't think I can do it.

811
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,770
The battle for the soul is
fought in the forum of art.

812
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,190
You're a fighter, Sid. That's why you're
here. That's why this is your major.

813
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,610
- Yeah, I'm a fighter.
- I didn't hear that.

814
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,200
- I'm a fighter.
- I don't believe you.

815
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,700
I don't.

816
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,210
I'm a fighter.

817
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:40,210
Okay.

818
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,510
So, at the risk of sounding
like a college drama teacher,

819
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,550
if you've got pain around
this kind of material, use it.

820
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,220
This is your role, Sid.

821
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:54,730
Cassandra is one of the great tragic
visionaries of literature.

822
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,400
She saw it all coming.
The wars,

823
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,570
the murder,
the madness.

824
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,030
She knew
she was cursed.

825
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:09,160
It was her fate,
and she embraced it.

826
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,990
None of us can avoid our fate,
but as an artist...

827
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,710
you can honestly face it...

828
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,710
and fight it.

829
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,550
- You're good.
- There's no understudy. I'm desperate.

830
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,850
You can do this.

831
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,270
Okay, everybody. Gather around.
Third Act, one last time.

832
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:43,190
Cue the music.

833
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:59,870
All behold the dreaded
fate of Troy...

834
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,960
that once stood proud and light
upon the hills of Sparta !

835
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:09,720
Now shrouded in
the deathly smoke of ruin,

836
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,800
her royal children
pitched from her walls,

837
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:18,640
her people driven
through her ruins.

838
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:24,150
And now alone in
fate's cruel isolation...

839
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,650
stands Cassandra,

840
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:30,950
her kingdom,
family and friends...

841
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:33,870
driven to the wind.

842
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:40,120
- No crime against gods or man...

843
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,080
have I committed,

844
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:45,340
saith to speak
the truth.

845
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,800
And each hideous vision
born from my mind...

846
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,800
has come to pass.

847
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,850
Troy has fallen,

848
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:59,640
not by my hand
or wish,

849
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,730
but as I foresaw.

850
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:10,570
So now,
fate's vengeful eye...

851
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,610
is fixed...

852
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:17,950
on me.

853
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,500
Tell us, O Cassandra,
where has the sweetness...

854
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,670
of life gone ?

855
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:27,460
What stays fate's hand
from striking now at thee ?

856
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,880
What stays fate's hand
from thee ?

857
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,550
What stays fate's hand
from thee ?

858
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:34,550
What stays fate's hand
from thee ?

859
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,180
What stays fate's hand
from thee ?

860
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:02,330
All right, hold it.
Hold it !

861
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,330
Everyone, take five.

862
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,600
Sidney ?

863
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,950
Sid.
Your escort has arrived.

864
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:42,700
- Derek, how long have you been here ?
- I just got here.

865
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:45,620
- Is everything okay ? What's goin' on ?
- What happened to Mickey ?

866
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:48,630
We swapped. He had to edit.
You get me instead. What happened ?

867
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,590
Derek, don't.

868
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:57,380
Don't. I-l just need to be alone
right now, okay ?

869
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,310
Being alone is not
the answer, Sid.

870
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:06,520
Yeah, well,
I think it is.

871
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,400
I need some distance.

872
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,900
Well, do I
get a say in this ?

873
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,320
No.

874
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,290
I guess I'm supposed
to be... understanding.

875
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:32,920
Yeah.

876
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,760
You got it.

877
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,810
All right. Let's just assume the killer
is repeating Woodsboro-

878
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,980
- Yes ?

879
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,280
- I have Bob calling.
- I'll have to call you back.

880
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,070
That doesn't
explain Sidney's attack.

881
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:00,660
Sidney wasn't killed
in Woodsboro.

882
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,820
Wasn't for
a lack of trying.

883
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:05,240
The killer's trying
to finish what was started.

884
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:07,450
- Sid's under protection, right ?
- Yeah.

885
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,790
- What ?

886
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:12,380
- Bob really needs to talk to you-
- Tell Bob I'll call him back.

887
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,880
- When'd she start smoking ?
- Ever since
those nude pictures on the internet.

888
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,130
It was just my head.
It was Jennifer Aniston's body.

889
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,220
Anyway, you're
forgetting something.

890
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,010
In Woodsboro, there were more victims
before the homestretch-

891
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,390
Tatum, my cameraman,
Himbry-

892
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:29,890
Time out ! I don't need to be hearing
about no dead cameramen, all right ?

893
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,650
Now, I'm warning you guys. I am a verb
away from vacatin' these premises.

894
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:36,360
I'm gonna get me some coffee,
donuts, Prozac,

895
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,940
see if I can find some crack,
Special K- "X," not Malcolm-

896
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:42,160
and I'll be back when you guys
start talking about something...

897
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,700
a little more Saved By The Bell-ish,
all right ?

898
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:48,500
- He seems a little shaky.
- Don't worry about him.

899
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,500
If the killer is following a pattern,
maybe we can figure out who's next.

900
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,580
I wouldn't follow
a killer's pattern.

901
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:56,920
We were all involved in Woodsboro.
Could be any one of us.

902
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,380
So what do you wanna do, bonehead ? Sit
here and wait and see who drops next ?

903
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,970
- Well, I don't know. "Phonehead."

904
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:09,270
- Gale's not here !

905
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,600
I'm not interrupting anything, am I ?

906
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,730
You three
look deep in thought.

907
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:17,770
Have you ever felt a knife
cut through human flesh...

908
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:22,570
- and scrape the bone beneath ?
- It's him.

909
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,120
- Who ?
- The killer.

910
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,660
He can see us.

911
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:36,500
- Just keep him on the phone.
- What do you want me to say ?

912
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:40,260
I-l don't know. Just keep him talking.
Come on, Gale.

913
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,380
- Uh- Hi.
- What are we doing ?

914
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:44,380
Look for somebody
with a cell phone.

915
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:47,760
- So what's your favorite scary movie ?
- You'll never find me.

916
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,600
What do you care ?
Let 'em have their fun.

917
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,980
So, uh-
What's up ?

918
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,650
What's your
favorite scary movie ?

919
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:01,610
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening.
What's yours ?

920
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,950
- What's your problem ?
- Sorry.

921
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,660
Wait. Let me guess.
The House On Sorority Row ?

922
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,910
Dorm That Dripped Blood ?
Splatter University ?

923
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:13,410
Graduation Day ?
Final Exam ?

924
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,500
- Am I close ?
- Closer than you think.

925
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:21,510
Too slow, geek.
Do you want to die ?

926
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:25,300
Is that the best you can do ? Because
Billy and Stu were much more original.

927
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,680
Hey !

928
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,680
- Who's this ?
- Who's this ?

929
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,810
- Gale Weathers, author of
The Woodsboro Murders.
- Who ?

930
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,810
Come on.

931
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:36,020
Okay.

932
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,520
He's gotta be
around here someplace.

933
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:40,860
He's just playing with us.

934
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:45,150
White male suspect-
nine o'clock.

935
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:49,160
- My clock or your clock ?
- Your clock.

936
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,450
I'll go
around the back.

937
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:55,370
Why are you even here,
Randy ?

938
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,250
You'll never be
the leading man.

939
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:00,250
Fuck you !

940
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:03,800
No matter how hard you try,
you'll never be the hero,

941
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,630
and you'll never, ever
get the girl.

942
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,260
- Shit !
- Shit ! Sorry.

943
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:13,140
- Hey, man-
- Wrong guy, dead boy.

944
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:17,440
Oh, yeah ? Well, let's redirect
a moment, Mr. I'm-So-Original.

945
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,900
- What's she doing ?
- I don't know.

946
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:23,900
Hey ! Ah !

947
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,900
- What just happened ?
-What the hell are you doing ?

948
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:29,320
- A citizen's arrest-
- Can I help you ?

949
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:32,700
- Hello ? Hello ?
- Sorry. Beg your pardon.

950
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:37,370
Where's your innovation ? Why copycat
two high school loser-ass dickheads ?

951
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,040
Stu was a pussy-ass
wet rag.

952
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:43,340
And Billy Loomis- Billy Loomis !
What the fuck !

953
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:48,050
Jesus ! What a rat-lookin',
homo-repressed mama's boy !

954
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:50,050
Why not set
your goals higher, huh ?

955
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:53,060
You wanna be one
of the big boys ? Huh ?

956
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:57,140
Manson, Bundy, O.J.,
Son-

957
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,520
-Where's Randy ?
-I don't know. This guy just grabbed me.

958
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,020
- I'm okay, Mom.
- I don't see him.

959
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,860
Randy !

960
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:46,860
Ah !

961
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,860
What's goin' on ?

962
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:52,490
Yo, man.
Who broke my window ?

963
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:29,610
Did your computer
just freeze ?

964
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:33,070
You have an instant message,
that's all. Just hit "alt-M."

965
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,070
Yeah, but I'm
not signed on.

966
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,490
Someone here in the library.
All the terminals are connected.

967
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:59,520
- He's here.
- Shit.

968
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,310
Get here away from the computer.
Sid, it's probably just a sick joke.

969
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:08,360
- May I see your screen, please.
- Wait right here.

970
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,400
Yeah.

971
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,330
- Psst ! Sid, you okay ?

972
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:23,330
- Cotton.
- Can we talk for a sec ?

973
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,790
Um, this, this isn't
a good time.

974
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:28,090
Come on, Sid.
You sent me to prison.

975
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:31,090
I did over a year for you.
You can give me two minutes.

976
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:34,380
Cotton, I'm sorry. Every day I'm sorry.
I don't know how to apologize anymore.

977
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:38,220
Sorry-schmarry, Sid. I have the solution
to all of our problems.

978
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,010
What are you
talking about ?

979
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,720
First of all,
forget Gale Weathers.

980
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:45,390
She doesn't get it. She doesn't
see the story. Between you and me,

981
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,020
she wouldn't see the story if
it smacked her in the side of the head.

982
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:51,150
I mean, have you read that book ?
Which brings me to my point.

983
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:54,110
Who calls me out of the blue,
but Diane Sawyer.

984
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:56,110
Believe me, I was
as shocked as you are.

985
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,700
She tells me that if you and I
go on the air together,

986
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:01,290
- she will give us the entire hour.
- What ?

987
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:05,620
We're talking prime time, Sid.
You, me and Diane Sawyer.

988
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:08,040
- Cotton, I can't.
- No, no. Look, Sidney.

989
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:10,170
If this is about money,
it's not like we're not getting paid.

990
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:13,960
There's $10,000 each,
not to mention what I've got going
on the side with the 900 number.

991
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:17,260
- Cotton-
- I know. You don't like the press.

992
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,600
I know that,
and I respect it.

993
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,390
But-But, Sidney-

994
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:26,140
It's Diane Sawyer. Hello ?

995
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:31,610
She's a class act. Sidney, this could
be some very, very heavy exposure.

996
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:34,320
I'm sorry.

997
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,820
Look, between the movie
and the book...

998
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:40,450
people know the truth.

999
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:44,750
Let's get on with our lives.
There's been enough exposure.
Why would you want any more ?

1000
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,580
Why ? I don't know,
Sidney. I don't know.

1001
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,500
Uh, maybe because I fucking
deserve a little exposure ?

1002
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,500
I mean, come on, Sidney.
You dragged my name through the mud,

1003
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:54,840
everybody thinks I'm
some kind of psycho killer,

1004
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:58,260
and all I'm asking for is one fucking
Diane Sawyer interview...

1005
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,430
to maybe get my side
of the story straight.

1006
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:03,810
Now, I don't think I'm being
unreasonable in that request.

1007
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,230
Do you ?
Honestly ?

1008
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,480
I'm... sorry, Cotton,
but no.

1009
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:15,980
You're sorry.

1010
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:18,950
Yeah, I bet you're
real sorry, Sidney.

1011
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:23,370
Such a good angle, Sidney.
Loveable and fucked up Sidney Prescott !

1012
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:26,660
Everybody's favorite
little victim !

1013
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,710
- Ow ! What are you doing ?
- Relax !

1014
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,750
- Put your hands on top of your head !
- Shut the fuck up !

1015
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:35,500
Jesus ! I'm not Billy Loomis !
You killed him ! He's dead ! Remember ?

1016
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:38,340
Run it by me one more time,
will ya ?

1017
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:42,470
- Why did you attack Sidney Prescott ?
- I didn't- There was no attack.

1018
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:44,680
We were talking
very heatedly.

1019
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,720
Miss Prescott and l...

1020
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:50,230
have a very
complicated past.

1021
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,350
I didn't think
that was a crime.

1022
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,530
- No, but homicide is.
- Okay then, book me. Book me.

1023
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:58,820
Okay ? Look.

1024
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,070
I don't know about homicide,
but you've definitely...

1025
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:04,530
got me for raising my voice
in a public library.

1026
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:09,000
We're dealing with four murders
here. You watch your mouth.

1027
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,630
That shouldn't have been Randy.

1028
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,920
- It should have been me.
- No.

1029
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,380
I should call his mother.

1030
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:23,260
Sid, I already made
that phone call.

1031
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:29,980
Are you okay ?

1032
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:33,060
Stop treating me like glass,
Dewey, I'm not gonna break.

1033
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:36,190
It's okay to break.

1034
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:38,190
It's not gonna happen.

1035
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,900
You better hope
your alibi's airtight.

1036
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:44,740
Could I please remind everyone here
that I'm an innocent man.

1037
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:48,910
Don't you watch TV ? Current Edition ?
That was a very insightful program...

1038
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:52,660
on which it was made abundantly clear
that I'm an innocent man.

1039
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:56,420
So until you find me standing over
a dead body with a knife in my hand,

1040
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,670
I think you better treat me
with the rights and privileges...

1041
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:01,970
accorded to every innocent citizen
in this country.

1042
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,850
I don't- Is there- Is there
some problem with the word "innocent" ?

1043
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:11,980
I know. It's a big one.
Chief ?

1044
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:25,780
- What's going on ?
- I have to let him go.

1045
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:28,030
- Why ?
- We don't have anything on him.

1046
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,920
Sign here.

1047
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,670
Gale.
Enjoying the show ?

1048
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,840
- Cops are funny.
- What do you think you're doing ?

1049
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:47,550
Waiting for
my 15 minutes of fame.

1050
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,350
You can understand that,
can't you, Gale ?

1051
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,690
Don't do anything stupid,
Cotton.

1052
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:59,270
Gale, you were so
instrumental in my freedom.

1053
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,400
You're not having
character doubts now, are you ?

1054
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,330
- Sidney, if you change your mind-
- Come on. Take a hike.

1055
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:15,830
Sorry about that.

1056
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:18,170
What a creep.

1057
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,210
They're gonna take you
somewhere safe, Sid.

1058
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,960
Yeah ?
Where's that.

1059
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:26,010
I don't know, but I'll
be there with you.

1060
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:31,810
We should get going.

1061
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:34,680
We'll take you by the dorm,
and you can pack some things.

1062
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:37,480
We've issued
a campus lock-in this evening.

1063
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:41,360
-No one's allowed out after dark, okay ?
-Yeah.

1064
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,030
Who's doing this, Dewey ?
I mean,

1065
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:46,610
if not Cotton,
then who ?

1066
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:49,030
I don't know, Sid,
but I'll find him.

1067
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:58,250
Any leads, Gale ? Do you think
the killer will come after you ?

1068
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:00,380
How does it feel to be
on the other side of the news ?

1069
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,500
There's Cotton.
Cotton ! Hey !

1070
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:05,170
- Are you still a suspect ?
- It's all been a huge misunderstanding.

1071
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,170
- Have you been officially released ?
- Gale ! Hang on one second.

1072
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,590
How about a photo ?
No ? You look great.

1073
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,600
How're you
holding up, Gale ?

1074
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:16,230
Must be scary knowing somebody's
out there waiting, watching,
enjoying all this.

1075
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:18,270
- How does that make you feel ?
- Look, local woman !

1076
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:20,940
I know that you hold me up
as your career template...

1077
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:25,030
and it gives you some sort of...
charge to challenge me.

1078
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:27,570
But give it a rest !

1079
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:30,990
You're right. I'm sorry.
It's my-

1080
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:32,990
It was the wrong time.
I'm sorry.

1081
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:42,170
- What's going on ?
- Whoo, let's see. For starters,
they impounded my van.

1082
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:45,000
It's now an official
crime scene, thanks to you.

1083
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:47,550
Here's your footage.
Enjoy.

1084
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:49,590
See ya.
Wouldn't wanna be ya.

1085
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:51,590
Joel, I need you !

1086
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:55,260
No. No, you need to
have your head examined.

1087
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,070
- I feel bad, Dewey.

1088
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,070
I feel really bad.

1089
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,660
I never say that
because...

1090
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,460
I never feel bad
about anything.

1091
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:23,330
But I feel bad now.

1092
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:30,300
Is this
just another...

1093
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:33,260
brilliant Gale Weathers
performance ?

1094
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,640
There are no cameras here.
I just wanna find this fucker !

1095
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:43,310
I- I really do.

1096
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:48,070
Me too.

1097
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,910
Could I
give you a hand ?

1098
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,840
What's in here ?

1099
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,630
Just some crowd footage
that Joel shot.

1100
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:15,390
Hey, wait a minute.

1101
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:22,980
If the killer really is
watching and relishing every minute,

1102
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,350
then he'd be here
on these tapes, right ?

1103
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,400
- At each crime scene.
- It's worth a look.

1104
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:34,610
It's definitely
worth a look.

1105
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,300
This way.

1106
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:58,850
Dubbing room.
Editorial.

1107
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:00,890
Video archive.

1108
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,730
- It's locked.
- Can you pick it ?

1109
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:11,230
- That would be breaking and entering.
- No shit.

1110
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,820
There's gotta be a VCR
around here somewhere.

1111
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,820
What's in there ?

1112
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,450
- Now we're gettin' somewhere.
- Perfect !

1113
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,590
- Let's start with this one.

1114
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,890
- Sorry. Oh !
- Oh !

1115
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:43,430
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.

1116
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:46,230
- Did I hurt you ?
- No.

1117
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:13,250
You're a money-hungry,
fame-seeking-

1118
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:17,260
forgive me for saying-
mediocre writer...

1119
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,760
who's got a cold storage shed
where her heart should be.

1120
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,350
- I didn't mean to imply-
- Listen.

1121
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:28,100
- You're cute when you're angry.
- I was rude.

1122
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:30,520
I was being rude.

1123
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:36,990
Dewey, I'm sorry.

1124
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:41,280
I never meant
to hurt you. Hey.

1125
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:46,620
Really.

1126
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:10,060
I should be studying.
You know I got a Bio-

1127
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:12,650
Dewey.

1128
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,150
Dewey !

1129
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:20,360
- Sorry.
- That's not my footage.

1130
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,990
Outside.

1131
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:30,210
- Fuck you !
- No matter how hard you try,
you'll never be the hero,

1132
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:33,130
and you'll never, ever
get the girl.

1133
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,130
- Sorry.
- Wrong guy, dead boy.

1134
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:44,430
- Stay here.
- Dewey, don't !

1135
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,280
Dewey !

1136
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,410
There's no one there.

1137
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,320
Fuck !

1138
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,720
Gale !

1139
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,930
Gale ?

1140
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,290
Gale !

1141
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,460
No !

1142
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,710
So.

1143
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,720
So.

1144
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:35,050
Listen, Sid.

1145
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,890
Hey, wait up !

1146
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:41,640
- She's- She's fine.
- I'm her therapist.

1147
01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:45,730
Bye, Derek.

1148
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:48,020
Bye.

1149
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:50,070
We better get going.

1150
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:57,490
When this is all over,

1151
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:00,950
I'll still be here.

1152
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:39,410
You ! Prepare to die.

1153
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:43,700
- You gave up your letters.
- Oh, man.

1154
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:48,130
I'm not-
Uh, guys-

1155
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:50,960
- To Troy ! We march !
- Whoo !

1156
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:55,550
This is so romantic.

1157
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:57,760
- And so Greek !

1158
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:08,230
I was in the wrong place
But it must have been the right time

1159
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:12,440
I was in the right place
But it must have been the wrong song

1160
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:17,280
I was in the right vein
But it seemed like the wrong arm

1161
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:21,160
I was in the right world
But it seemed like wrong, wrong, wrong

1162
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:24,910
- Wrong song
- Who do you love, baby ?

1163
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,920
- Sidney.
- Did you say
"my Omega Kappa Beta brothers" ?

1164
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,170
No, I said Sidney !

1165
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:55,150
So, where are you
taking us, anyway ?

1166
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:58,030
If we tell you,
we'll have to kill you.

1167
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,280
Don't ask; don't tell.

1168
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:33,560
Help me !

1169
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:37,530
Oh, my God !

1170
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:39,990
Outta the car,
you fucker !

1171
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:50,750
Get down back there !
Come on, you son-of-a-bitch !

1172
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:52,750
I'll blow your
fuckin' head-

1173
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:36,290
- Is he dead ?
- I don't think so.

1174
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:41,380
- He's still breathing.
- Oh !

1175
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,010
Oh, is he dead ?

1176
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,810
Oh, God.
I think so.

1177
01:27:56,810 --> 01:28:00,940
- How are you
supposed to get outta here ?
- We're not. It's a cop car.

1178
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:13,500
Hallie, it's the only way out.
Help me out.

1179
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,040
Come on.

1180
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:48,660
We're jammed up against
a pole.

1181
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,580
Oh, my God.

1182
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:10,550
Oh. Oh, my God.

1183
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,350
Come on, Sid.
Don't ! Sid !

1184
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:23,360
God, I hate this shit.

1185
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:29,620
Oh, my God.
Don't do that again.

1186
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,170
Try the window.

1187
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:59,900
- Shit !
- Get me the fuck outta here, Sid.

1188
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:03,440
I can't. The door's jammed.
You have to go through the front.

1189
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,570
- Oh, no fuckin' way.
- Hallie, do it.

1190
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:09,360
Go on.
Hallie, go.

1191
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,410
Okay.

1192
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:23,210
Okay, that's right.
Shh.

1193
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:27,670
Okay.
Okay, that's good.

1194
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:33,050
Oh, right
through his eye.

1195
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:35,180
Come on.

1196
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,220
That's good. Easy. Easy.

1197
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:39,980
He's not gonna hurt you.

1198
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,610
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

1199
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:59,200
- Hallie.
- What ?

1200
01:30:59,290 --> 01:31:01,330
I wanna know
who it is.

1201
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,580
- Oh, no. Come on, Sid.
Please ? Let's just go.
- I'm going back.

1202
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:06,090
Look, look.
Stupid people go back.

1203
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:09,380
Smart people run. We're smart people, so
we should just get the fuck outta here.

1204
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:11,800
Hallie, I'm sick
of running.

1205
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,800
- If we know who it is, then it's over.
- No, we can just get the police.

1206
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:17,930
And when we come back, he'll be gone.
It'll only take a minute.

1207
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:22,390
- I have to do this.
- Sid. No, Sid. Come back !

1208
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:26,440
Sid, come back.
Shit.

1209
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:40,330
- Oh, shit.
- What ?

1210
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:45,000
- He's gone !
- What ?

1211
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,420
- No !

1212
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:15,320
- Gale.

1213
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:20,080
- No, no, no, no.
This isn't what it looks like.
- Get away from me.

1214
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:23,750
I found Dewey. I tried to help him.
I- No, no. Gale, wait.

1215
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:26,040
Gale ! Gale, wait !
Gale !

1216
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:30,340
Shit.

1217
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,100
- You can't miss the street-
- Help me !

1218
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:41,060
- ...curfew in full effect.
- Give me the goddamn phone !

1219
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:45,390
- Gale. I was right
in the middle of a story.
- I've got your goddamn story !

1220
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,110
- What's the matter ?
- Operator, this is an emergency !
Get me the police !

1221
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:50,940
- What's happening ?
- The killer !
It's Cotton-fucking-Weary !

1222
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:53,070
Cotton Weary ?

1223
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:43,910
Hello ?

1224
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,920
Gus ?

1225
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:56,220
Hello ?

1226
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:02,850
Hello ?

1227
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:15,780
Hello ?

1228
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:14,380
Derek ?

1229
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:17,750
Derek !
Oh, God.

1230
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:21,720
Thank you. Thank God, Sid. Thought I was
gonna be up there till opening night.

1231
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,640
- Shit ! Who tied these ?
We gotta get outta here.
- The brothers got me, Sid.

1232
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:28,560
- He's out there. He killed Hallie.
- What are you talking about ?

1233
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,230
- The killer ! He's here.
- Where ?

1234
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:34,520
Right here.

1235
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:37,480
- You're fast, Sid.
- Get me down. Hurry !

1236
01:35:37,570 --> 01:35:42,070
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You really wanna trust your boyfriend ?

1237
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:45,910
Don't you know history repeats itself ?

1238
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:47,910
Hmm, Sid ?

1239
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:57,670
Mickey.

1240
01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:00,960
Surprise, Sidney.

1241
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:05,800
- What the fuck ?
- Since Derek, here,
disappeared on my ass,

1242
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:09,430
I been on my own
all fuckin' night.

1243
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:12,140
- Thanks a lot, partner.
- You motherfucker !

1244
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:14,770
Sid, he's crazy.
You know me better than that.

1245
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:19,440
Come on, Sid.
I gotta have a partner.

1246
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:22,280
I couldn't have possibly
done this alone.

1247
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,660
- God, Derek.
- Sid.

1248
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:28,240
Oh, no, Sid. Sid.
No, no, no, no.

1249
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:30,830
It's okay, Derek.
We got her.

1250
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,330
You-
Sid, he's lying !

1251
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:36,790
Sid ! Sid !
Untie me.

1252
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,590
- Sid, untie me.
- Hmm ?

1253
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:41,630
Boyfriend. Killer.
Boyfriend. Killer.

1254
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:44,840
Sid, the man is lying !
Untie me. Sid.

1255
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:47,850
Untie me.
Untie me.

1256
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:51,930
What do you think, Derek ?
Sidney experiencing some deja vu ?

1257
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:55,140
No. No. I am gonna
fuckin' kill you !

1258
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:58,610
Fuckin' kill you !
You are dead ! Dead !

1259
01:36:58,690 --> 01:37:01,690
- Derek.

1260
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:03,990
- Sid. - Derek.

1261
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:10,490
I'm sorry.

1262
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:14,660
I never...

1263
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:18,170
would've...
hurt you.

1264
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:20,540
Never.

1265
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:35,390
You should really deal with
your trust issues, Sid.

1266
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:39,190
I mean, poor Derek. He's completely
innocent. And such a nice boy too.

1267
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:43,530
He's bright and funny and
handsome. Decent singing voice.
And he was gonna be a doctor.

1268
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:46,860
This was just the kind of boy
you'd like to take home to Mom.

1269
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:49,360
- If you had a mom.
- Fuck you !

1270
01:37:49,450 --> 01:37:52,410
Oh ! So vulgar. Did Billy
let you talk to him this way ?

1271
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:55,160
Billy was a sick fuck,
just like you.

1272
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:58,080
No. Billy was a sick fuck
who tried to get away with it.

1273
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:00,920
Mickey is a sick fuck
who wants to get caught. Yeah !

1274
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,380
See, I've got my whole defense
planned out.

1275
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:07,050
I'm gonna blame
the movies.

1276
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:09,760
Pretty cool, huh ?
It hasn't been done before.

1277
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,390
You see, this is just the beginning,
a prelude to the trial.

1278
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:16,890
That's where the real fun is 'cause
these days it's all about the trial.

1279
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:20,400
Can't you see it ? The effects
of cinema violence on society.

1280
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,230
I'll get Dershovitz
or Cochran to represent me.

1281
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:25,610
Bob Dole on the witness stand
in my defense.

1282
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:28,030
Hell, the Christian Coalition'll
pay my legal fees.

1283
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:31,370
It's airtight, Sid.

1284
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:34,200
I'm an innocent victim.

1285
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:37,410
- You're a psychotic.
- Yeah, well. Shh.

1286
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,410
That'll be our little secret.

1287
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:43,540
'Cause people love a good trial.
It's like theater. They're dyin' for it.

1288
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:47,090
And I've worked hard
to give the audience what they want.

1289
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:50,630
That's what Billy was good at.
He knew... it's all about...

1290
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:52,510
- execution.
- Yeah ?

1291
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:56,560
Well, you're forgetting
one thing about Billy Loomis.

1292
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,350
What's that ?

1293
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:01,350
I fucking killed him.

1294
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,810
You piece of shit !

1295
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,630
Sid.

1296
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:36,100
You got a Linda Hamilton
thing going.

1297
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:39,140
No, no. It's nice.
I like it.

1298
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:42,690
Now, who's doin' that ?

1299
01:39:42,770 --> 01:39:47,230
Could that be... the mystery guest
waiting in the wings ?

1300
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:49,860
Told ya I had a partner.

1301
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,950
Surprise cameo
just for you.

1302
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:58,790
Gale.

1303
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:11,550
Mrs. Loomis ?

1304
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:16,010
- What ?
- Billy's mother !

1305
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:19,470
Nice twist, huh ?
Didn't see it comin', did ya ?

1306
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,480
Jesus.

1307
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:25,520
It can't be. I've-
I've seen pictures of you.

1308
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,810
This is 60 pounds
and a lot of work later.

1309
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:30,650
It's called a make-over.
You should try it.

1310
01:40:30,730 --> 01:40:34,200
Look a little tired
yourself there, Gale.

1311
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:37,200
- So you two are in this together ?
- Yeah, well.

1312
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:42,040
Had to have financing.
Tuition's expensive.

1313
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:46,880
Deb, there- my backer. We met on the
Internet. Psycho Web site. Classifieds.

1314
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:51,260
There's only an estimated
97 active serial killers in the country.

1315
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:55,050
So Mickey, here, was quite a find.
Definitely one on the way up.

1316
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:59,050
- All he needed was a little
guidance and nurturing.
- As only a mother can do.

1317
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:01,850
Told you it was gonna work.
Wait till the trial !

1318
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,890
It is gonna rock !

1319
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:07,400
Oh, Mickey.
There's not gonna be a trial.

1320
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,530
- Gale !

1321
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:31,420
Two birds, one stone.

1322
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:37,590
Oh, Mickey was a good boy, but, my God,
that whole blame the movies motive.

1323
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:39,760
Did you buy that
for one second ?

1324
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:42,890
Poor boy was completely
out of his mind.

1325
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:46,310
- And you're not ?
- No. I'm very sane.

1326
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:49,940
My motive isn't
as '90s as Mickey's.

1327
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:53,360
Mine is just
good old fashioned revenge.

1328
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:56,280
You killed my son !

1329
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:00,120
And now I kill you. And I can't think
of anything more rational.

1330
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,950
You're never gonna
get away with this.

1331
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:05,370
Of course I will.

1332
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:07,660
Everything's traceable
back to Mickey.

1333
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:10,750
Including the cop gun he used
to kill everybody.

1334
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:12,920
But let's just suppose
that you...

1335
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,630
had gotten hold
of the other cop's gun.

1336
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:19,090
And you chased Mickey. And there was
a big shoot-out and a big scuffle.

1337
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:23,140
And you shot Mickey,
killed Mickey dead.

1338
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:29,440
But not before he got off
one shot at you.

1339
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:33,150
Okay. So, have I
covered everything ?

1340
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:35,820
Are there any questions, any comments ?
You know what, though ?

1341
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:38,820
Who give a flyin' fuck
anyway ?

1342
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:43,620
Let 'em try and track down
the second possible killer.
Debbie Salt doesn't exist.

1343
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:46,950
You're as crazy
as your son was.

1344
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:50,290
What did you just say ?

1345
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:55,170
Was that a negative, disparaging
remark about my son ? About my Billy ?

1346
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:57,340
No, Billy was a good boy.

1347
01:42:57,420 --> 01:42:59,840
Billy was perfect.
You did a bang up job, Mrs. Loomis.

1348
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:03,050
It's not wise to patronize
a woman with a gun, Sidney.

1349
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:06,850
Randy spoke poorly of Billy,
and I got a little knife happy.

1350
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:09,310
I was a good mother.

1351
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:13,060
You know what
makes me sick ?

1352
01:43:13,150 --> 01:43:15,900
I'm sick to death of people saying
that it's all the parent's fault.

1353
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:18,570
That it all starts with the family.
You wanna blame someone ?

1354
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:20,740
Why don't you blame
your mother ?

1355
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:24,320
She's the one who stole my husband
and broke up my family.

1356
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:28,000
And then you took my son !

1357
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:32,540
You don't know what it is
to be a mother.

1358
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:37,000
To raise a child and teach him...
and guide him-

1359
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:39,670
And abandon him.

1360
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,930
Isn't Mickey
supposed to be dead ?

1361
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,590
Don't you fuckin' move !

1362
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:25,460
- Goddammit !
- Cotton.

1363
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:28,880
Okay, okay, okay.
Everybody slow down.

1364
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:32,390
I have had
a very, very bad day,

1365
01:46:32,430 --> 01:46:37,020
and I would like to know exactly
what the fuck is going on here ?

1366
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:39,690
- Sidney ?
- Cotton, meet Billy Loomis' mother.

1367
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:41,690
She's the killer.

1368
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:43,690
What ?

1369
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:49,280
- Then who's that ?
- The other killer.

1370
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:53,700
- Mickey.
- Okay.

1371
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:56,290
- Look, Cotton-
- Shut up.

1372
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:59,410
So. Hi.

1373
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,710
You're, uh,
not Debbie Salt, are you ?

1374
01:47:03,790 --> 01:47:06,590
You're not with
the Post Telegraph.

1375
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:09,420
No, but I can still
help you, Cotton.

1376
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:11,800
Ah-ah-ah !

1377
01:47:11,890 --> 01:47:14,050
You don't need her.
Let me kill her !

1378
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:18,230
As long as she's alive,
you're never gonna be the lead story.

1379
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:20,560
That's what you really want,
isn't it, Cotton ?

1380
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:23,020
If you really wanna be
in the spotlight,

1381
01:47:23,110 --> 01:47:26,440
just let me kill her...
right now.

1382
01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:29,820
Then you're the only survivor.
You're the star !

1383
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:36,080
She sent you to prison
for a year !

1384
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:39,410
Personally, I think
it's rather poetic.

1385
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:50,300
No. No, Cotton,
don't you listen to her.

1386
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:53,220
Well- Well-

1387
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,760
It's, uh, quite a predicament
you're in, Sid.

1388
01:47:55,850 --> 01:47:59,470
- Cotton-
- I mean, she makes a good point.

1389
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:01,640
Let me think about this.

1390
01:48:01,730 --> 01:48:03,770
Maybe you should too.

1391
01:48:03,850 --> 01:48:07,070
Betcha that Diane Sawyer interview's
lookin' real good right about now.

1392
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,320
Huh ?

1393
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,830
Consider it done.

1394
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:48,020
Wow.

1395
01:48:48,110 --> 01:48:51,030
That... was intense.

1396
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,040
Hey, Sidney, uh-

1397
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:09,000
Look, I want you to know that I would
never, ever do anything to hurt you.

1398
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,920
Cotton, give me the gun.

1399
01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:19,100
Yeah. Okay. Sure.
Take it.

1400
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:22,520
Hey, Sid, we should talk about
exactly what happened here.

1401
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,060
You know- I mean, get our stories
straight for the press statement.

1402
01:49:26,140 --> 01:49:28,230
- Oh, shit !

1403
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:31,400
- Cotton.
- Could somebody get me outta here ?

1404
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:33,900
Gale !
Are you all right ?

1405
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:35,900
I been shot.
Of course not.

1406
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:38,530
- Help !
- Give me your hand, Gale.

1407
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:41,240
Jesus, Gale,
you scared the crap outta me.

1408
01:49:41,330 --> 01:49:43,750
- Isn't anybody else
down there, is there ?
- No.

1409
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:46,870
So much for reporting
from the trenches, huh ?

1410
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:50,710
- Shut up, Cotton.
- How bad is it ?

1411
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:53,130
Just bounced off my ribs.

1412
01:49:53,210 --> 01:49:55,590
Geez, Gale, you got
more lives than a cat.

1413
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:06,310
Give me one of those.

1414
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:08,480
Is she dead ?

1415
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,650
I don't know.
They always come back.

1416
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:25,660
Whoa !

1417
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:43,390
Just in case.

1418
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:55,110
- That about wraps it up, Chief.
- Okay, Frank.

1419
01:50:55,150 --> 01:50:57,490
Take it easy.
You got a couple broken ribs.

1420
01:50:57,530 --> 01:50:59,610
- Greg, I'm okay.
- Sure.

1421
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:04,330
Hey, Gale.
Are you all right ?

1422
01:51:04,410 --> 01:51:07,160
- Joel.
- I'm- I'm back.

1423
01:51:07,250 --> 01:51:11,540
You know, I was thinking maybe we could
get the scoop like in the old days.

1424
01:51:11,630 --> 01:51:15,130
You're Gale Weathers...
at Windsor College.

1425
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:17,260
We got a live one here !

1426
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,260
- Move it !

1427
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:22,850
- Where's Gale ?
- There room in that one over there ?

1428
01:51:22,930 --> 01:51:25,220
- Yeah ! Watch your back !
- Dewey !

1429
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:28,810
- Let's go !
- Oh, God.

1430
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:31,310
I can't believe
you're alive.

1431
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:34,110
- Are you okay ?
- Gale.

1432
01:51:34,190 --> 01:51:36,650
You hang in there.

1433
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:40,360
- Knife went into some old scar tissue.

1434
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,360
Saved his life.

1435
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:46,370
Bye-bye.

1436
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:50,370
- I'm coming with you.

1437
01:51:55,670 --> 01:51:58,090
- Can you tell us what you saw ?
- What happened in there ?

1438
01:51:58,170 --> 01:52:00,760
Can you tell us how it feels
to be a hero ?

1439
01:52:04,890 --> 01:52:09,220
Talk to Cotton. He's the man
you want to interview.

1440
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:12,520
He's the hero.

1441
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:17,400
- Cotton !

1442
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:19,990
- What went on in there ?
- Is it true you're a hero ?

1443
01:52:24,570 --> 01:52:26,530
- Details, please !
- Look, guys,

1444
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:28,540
no one wants to give you
the story more than I do.

1445
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:30,910
Unfortunately, there is
a time and a place,

1446
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,920
and indeed, a price for everything,
so feel free to call me.

1447
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:36,130
Come on, Cotton.
Tell us something.

1448
01:52:36,210 --> 01:52:38,920
Well, uh,
I'll tell you one thing.

1449
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,220
It'll make a hell of a movie.
Thank you.

1450
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:08,490
Life's river shall rise

1451
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:10,490
She said

1452
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:15,870
And only the strong
shall survive, she said

1453
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:21,380
But I'm feeling quite weak
she said

1454
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:26,090
Will you comfort
and forgive me, she said

1455
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:38,520
She said
she's still searching

1456
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:41,360
For salvation's light

1457
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:44,150
Yet she wishes all day

1458
01:53:44,190 --> 01:53:47,030
And then she prays all night

1459
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:51,790
She said she won't
speak of love

1460
01:53:51,830 --> 01:53:54,290
'Cause love
she's never known

1461
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:02,750
Well, it's
moments like these

1462
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:06,380
When she hates to be alone

1463
01:54:06,470 --> 01:54:09,050
Forgive me

1464
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:12,100
She said

1465
01:54:27,450 --> 01:54:29,990
I'm sleepin' and right in
the middle of a good dream

1466
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:34,290
When all at once I wake up
from something that keeps
knocking at my brain

1467
01:54:34,370 --> 01:54:37,660
Before I go insane I hold
my pillow to my head

1468
01:54:37,710 --> 01:54:40,460
And spring up in my bed screaming out
the words I dread

1469
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:43,880
I think I love you

1470
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,630
I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of

1471
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:51,970
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
a love there is no cure for

1472
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:55,430
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of

1473
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:59,270
Though it worries me to say
that I never felt this way, yeah

1474
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:01,560
Believe me, you really
don't have to worry

1475
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:05,730
I only wanna make you happy
And if you say hey, go away, I will

1476
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:09,150
But I think better still
I'd better stay around and love you

1477
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:12,070
Do you think I have a case
Let me ask you to your face

1478
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:15,370
I think I love you

1479
01:55:15,410 --> 01:55:18,160
Yeah, I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of

1480
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:23,420
Afraid that I'm not sure of
a love there is no cure for

1481
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:26,920
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of

1482
01:55:27,010 --> 01:55:30,720
Though it worries me to say
that I never felt this way, yeah

1483
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:40,560
I don't know what I'm up against,
I don't know what it's all about

1484
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:43,230
I got so much to think about
Yeah

1485
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:46,190
Yeah, I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of

1486
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:51,570
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for

1487
01:55:51,610 --> 01:55:54,870
Do you think you love me

1488
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:58,120
I think I love you

1489
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:02,250
I think I love you

1490
01:56:03,330 --> 01:56:08,050
Pain goes away
I dig a hole

1491
01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:12,720
Pain goes away
I dig a hole

1492
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:17,560
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

1493
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:22,600
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

1494
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:27,070
Runnin', goin' out at night

1495
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:31,610
Friends they
push and pull you

1496
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:34,820
Burned out ground
Poor flowers

1497
01:56:34,910 --> 01:56:40,290
Spinning, falling outta time

1498
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:44,880
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

1499
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:49,590
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

1500
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:54,180
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

1501
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:59,260
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

1502
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:01,480
La-la-la-la, ooh

1503
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:03,560
I'll dig a hole

1504
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:05,730
La-la-la-la, ooh

1505
01:57:05,810 --> 01:57:10,530
When it goes away

1506
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:33,970
I'm reminded

1507
01:57:34,050 --> 01:57:36,890
Someone thought they knew me

1508
01:57:36,930 --> 01:57:41,850
That I hadn't changed at all

1509
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:52,690
Wrapped up in a
picture perfect package

1510
01:57:52,730 --> 01:57:57,030
That just stands up
way too tall

1511
01:58:02,330 --> 01:58:06,670
Because they see my world

1512
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:13,010
Ooh, through
the eyes of sand

1513
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:24,890
You walk in desert,
Baby, you're a polished stone

1514
01:58:24,930 --> 01:58:28,650
You walk in desert,
Baby, you're a polished stone

1515
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:31,980
Ooh, oh

1516
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:36,150
You don't know my world

1517
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:40,120
You don't know my world

1518
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:44,120
You don't know my world

1519
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:47,540
Ah-ah

1520
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:50,960
You walk in the desert

1521
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,090
And I walk in the desert

1522
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:57,420
Yeah, I walk in the desert

1523
01:58:57,470 --> 01:59:02,350
Scream !

1524
01:59:02,430 --> 01:59:06,310
Could be your best friend.
Could be your enemy.

1525
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:12,480
Scream
I hear him coming

1526
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:15,570
Scream
I hear him coming

1527
01:59:15,650 --> 01:59:17,950
I see him coming
I hear him coming, Peace

1528
01:59:17,990 --> 01:59:20,740
Y'all be trippin'
Man, the ghetto got me I know it

1529
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:23,660
I be like eyes open, turnin'
With both of my toys on him

1530
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:25,950
These daydreams sometimes
turn to nightmares

1531
01:59:25,990 --> 01:59:28,660
I be trying to shake it
but it seem to be like right there

1532
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:31,830
I know some homies who made
deals for a short time to live good

1533
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:34,670
But when its all over you should see
the data that'll put 'em out the hood

1534
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:37,510
One, two
I'm comin' for you

1535
01:59:37,590 --> 01:59:40,340
Three, four
I'm kickin' up in your door

1536
01:59:40,430 --> 01:59:43,050
This whole life
it seem to be a bad dream

1537
01:59:43,140 --> 01:59:46,100
Scream as loud as you want but
ain't nobody gonna hear your scream

1538
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:48,810
Scream
I hear him coming

1539
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:51,480
Scream
I hear him coming

1540
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:54,360
Scream
I hear him coming

1541
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:57,030
Scream
I hear him coming

1542
01:59:57,110 --> 02:00:00,070
Scream
I hear him coming

1543
02:00:00,150 --> 02:00:02,660
I see him coming
I hear him coming
