943-66-2291. Pension Services, please.

3
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,950
Thank you, Mr. Moses,
please hold for your representative.

4
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,677
Hi, this is Sarah.

5
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,137
It's Frank Moses.

6
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,599
Hey. Frank. What's going on?

7
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,267
Not much.

8
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:29,106
I just called because
they didn't send that check out again.

9
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,902
Oh. I can't believe
they haven't worked this out by now.

10
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,530
I'll make sure they send
another one out today.

11
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,156
I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,283
Well, what are you gonna do?

13
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,788
So how's your avocado?

14
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,332
It's got two green leaves on it.

15
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,752
I told you, you could grow something.

16
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,214
Well, it was pretty close.
It was life or death.

17
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,593
I'm not kidding.
It could have gone either way.

18
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,178
How's your day going?

19
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,765
My day? My day sucks.

20
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,183
Your day sucks?

21
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,143
Yeah.

22
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,814
Right now I just want to travel.

23
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,610
I'm thinking Chile.
Sounds like an adventure. I don't know.

24
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,571
You ever been to Chile?

25
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,239
Yeah.

26
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,991
You have? What's it like?

27
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,784
Mountains.

28
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,786
That's it?

29
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,705
Well, it was night, I...

30
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:27,915
It was...

31
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,126
Look, I gotta go.

32
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,086
Okay. Sure.

33
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,796
No, sorry, it's just Gladys.

34
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,718
What?

35
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:40,928
"It was night."

36
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,400
Hi, Mr. Moses!

37
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:56,944
Hi.

38
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,020
-Did you start that new book?
-I did.

39
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,647
And, what's it called?

40
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,441
It's called Love's Savage Secret.

41
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,235
Nice.

42
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,487
Is it any good?

43
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,615
It's terrible. I love it. It's awful.

44
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,911
It's about this fashion designer

45
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:32,832
and his supermodel girlfriend,
and they get recruited

46
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:37,670
by the CIA to stop an assassination
at the Milan spring shows.

47
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,090
Well, who doesn't like Milan in the spring?

48
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,258
I guess.

49
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,594
Anyway,
I gotta do something for excitement.

50
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,598
My landlady keeps trying to set me up
with her bridge partners' kids.

51
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,559
She just told me she thinks I'm gay.

52
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,102
I try not to judge.

53
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:57,398
What? Shut up! I'm not gay.

54
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,526
So here's something weird.

55
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,072
I'm actually gonna be
in Kansas City next week.

56
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:07,992
In person?

57
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:13,039
That could be a bad idea.

58
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:14,999
It could be.

59
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,213
You still there?

60
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,799
Yeah. Yeah.

61
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,472
Why don't you call me
when you get to town?

62
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,891
Or... Yeah.

63
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,519
Okay. Bye.

64
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,146
Okay, bye.

65
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,151
Okay.

66
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,612
All right.

67
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,882
<i>Come in, Unit One.</i>

68
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,302
<i>Come in, Unit One.</i>

69
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,265
<i>Unit One, respond.</i>

70
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,988
Don't you know I got to find me a home

71
00:10:56,072 --> 00:11:00,951
Right now in your heart

72
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:05,247
I'll travel over miles...

73
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,790
Hey, aren't you going to invite me in?

74
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,834
No, I don't think so.

75
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,419
But I bought you dinner!

76
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,268
And you live with your mother.

77
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,020
Awesome.

78
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,234
Yeah, of course. You have no job.

79
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:39,740
You, mister, are not getting any of this.

80
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,911
Hey.

81
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,048
It's me. Frank.

82
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,426
The avocado?

83
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,098
Why are you here? Get out of my house!

84
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,808
-Hey!
-I told you to call first.

85
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,267
I'm not gonna hurt you.

86
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,771
Would you just listen to me? Please?
Stop that!

87
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,773
Get back. Go away. Stay away from me!

88
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,817
Is that my bag?

89
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,195
Yeah.

90
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,321
You packed it?

91
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,531
Yes.

92
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,366
Did you vacuum?

93
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,576
A little, yeah, it was messy.

94
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:25,994
Get back. Get out!

95
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,789
Please. We have to leave.
Right now. Stop it.

96
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,374
-Help! Help!
-Hey! Just listen to me, please!

97
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,167
-Someone is trying to kill me.
-Help!

98
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,961
-What are you doing? Listen to me!
-Intruder!

99
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,130
-Help!
-They've been trying to kill you, too.

100
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,550
Why would anyone want to kill me?

101
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,759
Because we've been under surveillance.

102
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,261
They've been listening
to our conversations.

103
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,512
Why?

104
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,349
Because of the way I talk to you.

105
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,226
What?

106
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,188
They know I like you.

107
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,948
Listen to me. Right now. Out the back door.

108
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,533
No way! No!

109
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,495
Don't get me wrong,
I know it's crazy.

110
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:09,830
Don't think that

111
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,001
I don't think this is crazy.

112
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,836
And it

113
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:22,301
couldn't be more different than how
I'd hoped to meet you for the first time.

114
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,304
But sometimes things happen.

115
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,183
And I just hope that someday
you and I could be

116
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,730
sitting somewhere, comfortably

117
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:39,943
and look back on this
as the great, big adventure that it is.

118
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,464
I'm a little hungry, too.
What should we get?

119
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,133
Pizza.

120
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,302
Listen, hon.

121
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,682
Yeah, lots of boys get bullied at school.

122
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:18,232
I know, but you can't solve it
by intervening like that.

123
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,610
No, I don't agree with you.

124
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,119
I know, it's hard.

125
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,915
I'll talk to him about it when I get home.

126
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,296
No, I should be on time tonight.

127
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,304
Milk, two percent? Okay, love you, bye.

128
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,890
Listen. I can make you rich.

129
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,850
Don't you know who I am?

130
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,185
Of course, I do.

131
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,760
This is off the books. Total blackout.

132
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,596
Yes, ma'am.

133
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,390
There's your target.

134
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,270
Retired analyst.

135
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:39,771
He was CIA.

136
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,399
Is that a problem?

137
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,155
No.

138
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,868
The spark in your eye sets my soul on fire

139
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,829
Your voice is like a angel above

140
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,376
The touch of your hand, woman
Drives me insane

141
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,880
But, baby, I want to be loved

142
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,799
Sorry.

143
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:16,183
Wow. If you let me go now,
I won't press charges.

144
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,185
-There's no hard feelings.
-We're way past charges.

145
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,313
How do I always attract losers like you?

146
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,649
I was in the CIA.

147
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,234
Yeah, I bet you were. I'll bet you're a spy.

148
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,155
I have to go see someone now...

149
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,158
You're just gonna make me sit here?
Like this?

150
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,869
You couldn't be safer.
No one knows where you are.

151
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,537
Oh, no. Don't do it.

152
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,373
-Just hold still.
-Don't please. I don't want it.

153
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,292
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

154
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,253
Your eyes are so beautiful.

155
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,052
Want to watch TV?

156
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,351
Be back soon.

157
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,565
Is that thing acting up again?

158
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,860
Oh, hi, Marna, yeah.

159
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,032
Give it a rap, will ya?
See if you could get it going for me.

160
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,784
Of course.

161
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,954
I don't know
why you don't fix this old thing.

162
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,455
Better picture.

163
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,625
-Try a little bit more to the left.
-Okay.

164
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,127
Yeah.

165
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,964
That's just perfect.

166
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,221
Thank you very much, Marna.

167
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,188
Unbelievable.

168
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,027
Should be ashamed of yourself.

169
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,828
It's nice to see you, kid.

170
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,455
It's good to see you, too.

171
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,210
So what's up?

172
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,297
Met a girl.

173
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,840
No.

174
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,008
Complicated.

175
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,722
Got a visit from a wet team.

176
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,807
At my house, 24 hours ago.

177
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,894
Did you ID any of them?

178
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,396
Kinda.

179
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,403
This used to be a gentleman's game.

180
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,555
And you know I love you. Bye.

181
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,313
Independent South African hit team

182
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,274
suspected of killing
a New York Times reporter.

183
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,236
Stephanie Chan. You know her?

184
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,696
No.

185
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,867
Somebody has a serious
hard-on for you, kid.

186
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,161
Yeah.

187
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,289
But why now? I'm retired.

188
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,751
Just have to dig some more.

189
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,629
Watch your back, too.

190
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,634
I'm 80 years old, I got stage 4 liver cancer.

191
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,929
-What the hell can they do to me?
-They can still shoot you.

192
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,099
Well...

193
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,228
I never thought this would happen to me.

194
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,564
What?

195
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,692
Getting old.

196
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,781
I mean, Vietnam, Afghanistan.

197
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,953
Green Springs Rest Home?

198
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,292
Go figure.

199
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,515
So Moses made 22 calls
to Pension Services

200
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,142
and that didn't stand out to you?

201
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,062
Unbelievable.

202
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,160
Hoorah.

203
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:51,333
Have Endercott intercept the girl
at the Hotel Capri.

204
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,251
Hey, Mike, change of plans.

205
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,469
She's just fine.

206
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,929
I can take you home.

207
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,180
Oh.

208
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,558
I gotta take you down to the station first
to get your statement.

209
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,561
Then there's a couple of federal guys
that are gonna want to talk to you.

210
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,606
I gotta say, I think you're pretty amazing
for breaking free

211
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,399
and keeping it together like you did.

212
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,485
That's impressive.

213
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,321
I'm gonna go back and get my purse...

214
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,906
I can have somebody
bring it downtown for you.

215
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,282
Get in the car!

216
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,534
Let me go! You're hurting me.

217
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,960
Am I gonna die?

218
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,837
No. You just need some sleep.

219
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,589
I may vomit.

220
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:45,470
This is just like Love's Savage Secret.

221
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,981
I am high.

222
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,066
You have such beautiful green eyes.

223
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:27,053
You really are CIA.

224
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,853
Officer down.
Corner of North Peters and Conti.

225
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,689
Suspect is a white male, 30s,
black suit and a tie,

226
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,315
driving a black Tahoe.

227
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,651
Freeze!
Put your weapon on the ground!

228
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,445
Put your weapon on the ground now!

229
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,532
Right now!

230
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,831
So you're saying
this was CIA sanctioned?

231
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,959
All right, Thelma, thanks.
I owe you one. Bye.

232
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,976
So it's like that, huh?

233
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,146
Yeah. It's like that.

234
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,284
Where are we?

235
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:19,290
How did we get to New York City?

236
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,963
I really hate you right now.

237
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,216
I was just hoping you'd be a little
more understanding of the situation.

238
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,262
I was hoping not to get kidnapped.
Or drugged.

239
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,681
I was hoping you'd have hair.

240
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,518
So it looks like none of our dreams
are coming true, at the moment.

241
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,978
Sorry about that.

242
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:45,066
Thanks for saving me. I guess.

243
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,486
No problem.

244
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:51,656
Not my best first date.

245
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,327
Not my worst, either.

246
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,999
Until we find out who's trying to kill us,
you're gonna have to stay with me.

247
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,793
For how long?

248
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:04,878
I don't know.

249
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:08,047
Whoever's trying to kill us
also killed a New York Times reporter.

250
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,300
She used to live in Chinatown.

251
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,484
Okay. Here we go. Let's come in here.
Right here. Wait a second.

252
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,945
-You just hang onto this tape.
-Oh, no.

253
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,780
No, you said we were just gonna talk to her.

254
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,574
We are. This'll help.

255
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,202
-The woman just lost her daughter.
-I know.

256
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,454
You can't just go around
duct taping everyone.

257
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,041
People are basically kind of decent.

258
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,628
That hasn't always been my experience.

259
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,633
Let me try and talk to her.

260
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,594
-What?
-Just let me do it.

261
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,141
They told me to be patient.

262
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,144
The police have done nothing.

263
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:08,149
They said it was just a burglary,
but nothing was missing.

264
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,984
She was scared.

265
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,154
We're hoping we can do more.

266
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,950
You worked with my Stephanie?

267
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,877
She sent me this.

268
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,506
I got it in the mail on the day she died.

269
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,181
What does this mean?

270
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,641
I don't know.

271
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,518
I tried dialing the numbers.

272
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,937
Police had no idea.

273
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,691
Where did Stephanie go to college?

274
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,528
Why are we here again?

275
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,780
Those numbers
on Stephanie Chan's postcard

276
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,699
are actually a call number for a book.

277
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,367
Call numbers start with letters.

278
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,703
In the Library of Congress, yeah.

279
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,456
In Harvard-Yenching,
it's a classification for Asian literature.

280
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,001
How could you possibly know that?

281
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,382
You speak Chinese?

282
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,157
Unbelievable.

283
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,246
Hank Maestriano died 2 weeks ago.
Car crash.

284
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,584
Daniel McGinty. Heart attack. Last week.

285
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,128
But if this is a hit list,

286
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:56,549
why is this guy still alive? Gabriel Singer.

287
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,761
Flies cargo planes.

288
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,140
That's a good question.

289
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,611
Hell of a mess.

290
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,404
Come on.

291
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,041
Joe Matheson, please.

292
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,794
Hold on.

293
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,465
Marna.

294
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,051
Hello?

295
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:01,656
What?

296
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,123
Joe.

297
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:20,341
Frank Moses is not a retired analyst
who's never worked in the field.

298
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,802
This guy has a history.

299
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:44,866
That's a file number.

300
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,785
You need to visit the back room.

301
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,329
You're going to meet the Records Keeper.

302
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,965
I didn't even know this place existed.

303
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,884
It doesn't.

304
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,233
Frank Moses' file.

305
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,247
You gotta be kidding me.

306
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:37,919
Frank Moses was one of the most effective
black op agents we've ever had.

307
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,088
He retired drug-lords, terrorists.

308
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,341
Hell, he toppled governments.

309
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,721
Yeah. He was truly gifted.

310
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,057
Why was he retired?

311
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,433
He got old.

312
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,646
Then some thumb-sucker came along
and tagged him "RED."

313
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,688
Red?

314
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:01,776
Yeah. RED. R-E-D.
"Retired: Extremely Dangerous."

315
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,444
Yeah.

316
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,448
Yeah.
They don't make them like that anymore.

317
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,452
Thanks.

318
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,080
I'm gonna need a data haunt.

319
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,666
Every flak he was ever involved in.
Every agent he's ever run.

320
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,627
I want NSA telephone surveillance,
voice recognition...

321
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,801
We have to find Marvin Boggs.

322
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,220
Marvin died two years ago in a fire.

323
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,223
Yeah. Marvin has died many times.

324
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,978
Oh, can we have that one?

325
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,255
All we need is a banjo.

326
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,674
Keep your voice down.

327
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,968
Don't make any sudden moves.

328
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,012
Just stay close to me.

329
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,347
-Don't use your cell phone.
-You took my cell phone.

330
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,434
Don't talk about cell phones.
Don't talk about satellites.

331
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,560
Seriously?

332
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:21,856
Why are you trying to kill me?

333
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:23,774
I'm not trying to kill you!

334
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:24,942
Oh, yeah. You are.

335
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,444
Why would I be trying to kill you?

336
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,071
Because the last time we met,
I tried to kill you.

337
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,364
That was a long time ago.

338
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,867
Some people hold on to things like that.

339
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,661
I'm not trying to kill you.

340
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,164
Okay?

341
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,375
So that makes us friends.

342
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,710
Right?

343
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:45,546
Right.

344
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,881
Good.

345
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,468
You wanna take that knife
out of my balls now?

346
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:56,807
Who is she?

347
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,477
Sarah. She's not trying to kill you either.

348
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,895
Yeah. Hi.

349
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,481
I don't stay in the open.

350
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,527
Come on, I'll show you the house.

351
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,905
What's that?

352
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,074
Decoy.

353
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,246
He lives in a car?

354
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,086
Come on in.

355
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,598
Why do you live here
when you have the other place?

356
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,560
Let's put it this way.

357
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,939
When the helicopter passed over
the house last year

358
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,275
and I could feel their eyes on me.

359
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,071
Wet like peaches.

360
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:55,950
I have a list here.

361
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,078
It was written by a reporter who's now dead.

362
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,789
Along with everyone whose names
are on that list.

363
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,499
Well, almost everyone.

364
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,378
Frank, how many times have I told you?

365
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,630
You cannot trust the system!

366
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:14,969
I told you when you're in the system,
they switch the flip and you're done.

367
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,764
Man, satellites, cell phones,

368
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:23,227
chips, net, the web, the dentist...

369
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,478
Marvin!

370
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,775
That list is the one we need help with.

371
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,319
Yeah, I gotta check the files.

372
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,822
Of course you do. Thanks, man.

373
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,498
This guy's insane.

374
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:49,754
Well, he thought he was the subject of
a secret government mind control project.

375
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,005
This'll take a minute.

376
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,465
Sure.

377
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,592
As it turns out,

378
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,014
he really was being given daily doses
of LSD for 11 years.

379
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:03,350
-In that case, he looks great. Yeah.
-Fantastic.

380
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:07,396
Got it. Guatemala. Fall 1981.

381
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:12,902
Five of the guys on this list were there,
not including us.

382
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,654
San Benito. Just outside.

383
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,156
Injun territory.

384
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:21,285
Yeah. Was a little village.
Everybody was killed. Civilians.

385
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,120
They told us, "Go in there. Clean it up.

386
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,997
"Make it look like it never happened."

387
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,750
You think everyone on this list was there?

388
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,503
Damn it.

389
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,046
Damn it!

390
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,799
Do you know what's wrong
with this country?

391
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,010
They're all trying to kill us?

392
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,553
Exactly!

393
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,556
Is there anybody still alive on that list?

394
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,643
Gabriel Singer.

395
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,019
Frank!

396
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,855
I never thought I'd say this again.

397
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,857
I am getting the pig!

398
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,367
Who's she talking to?

399
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,078
Just take it easy.

400
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,248
Frank, we gotta get rid of this broad.

401
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,042
I know a great place, just up the road.
Lots of alligators.

402
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:12,086
We're not getting rid of the broad.

403
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,046
I like her. Okay?

404
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:16,674
What's the angle?

405
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,968
No angle. I like her.

406
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:24,431
Okay. So, they pull her voice
from the pay phone,

407
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,100
probably right now,

408
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:29,353
install the recognition software
and back-trace it to Singer.

409
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,481
So then we show up,
they bring out the satellite,

410
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:34,567
and we're fried with Y-rays.

411
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,279
How you doing?

412
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,281
Good, fine.

413
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:51,375
November niner 745.

414
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:55,004
Singer is going to be in Mobile tomorrow.

415
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,797
We can catch him at the airfreight terminal.

416
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,173
How about that?

417
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,102
<i>The Sunset Limited
with service to New Orleans,</i>

418
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:14,648
<i>Houston, Tucson and Los Angeles
now boarding platform five.</i>

419
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,069
<i>It's the final boarding call
for the eastbound express...</i>

420
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,161
No, please! No!

421
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,871
You smell like Washington.

422
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,289
Who do you work for?

423
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,833
Coldwell Banker, I'm a real estate agent!
Please, don't hurt me.

424
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,919
No, no. Who do you work for?

425
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,712
-What?
-Who do you work for?

426
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,755
Marvin!

427
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,883
Frank, she's one of them.
She's been following us.

428
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:44,136
There's a camera in her bag.
I'm gonna kill her now.

429
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,680
No, please don't kill...
Don't let him kill me! Please!

430
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,184
Marvin, just wait, would you, please?

431
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,894
Marvin. Look. Marvin.

432
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,648
No camera in the bag.

433
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,525
Go, ma'am, now. Now.

434
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:04,949
Get a car.

435
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,700
Try not to kill anyone.

436
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,455
She was following us, Frank.

437
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,803
Sorry.

438
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,725
"She has a camera in her purse,
we have to kill her?"

439
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:33,811
Seriously?

440
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,609
See you in a minute.

441
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:46,740
Gabriel?

442
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,493
Right? Gabriel Singer?

443
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,204
What's this about?

444
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:56,041
Guatemala. 1981. San Benito.

445
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:57,209
I can't talk to you.

446
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,508
Pair beats ace.

447
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,262
I got one for you.

448
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,849
What did this twice-decorated,
west Texas Jew-boy Marine pilot

449
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,143
say to the Chinese
New York Times reporter?

450
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,269
I give up.

451
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,313
Nothing. I didn't tell her a damn thing.

452
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,857
The reporter's dead now.

453
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,485
And everyone she spoke to is either dead
or a target.

454
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,862
That includes you.

455
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:26,780
Oh, Christ.

456
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,412
They had me fly this guy out there
in the dead of night.

457
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,373
Hairy little airstrip in the middle of nowhere.

458
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:40,002
He was CIA,
some dorky little spook in a suit and tie.

459
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,253
Remember that guy?

460
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,048
-Black glasses.
-Yeah. He was giving the orders.

461
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,133
He picked up a package
and I flew him back out.

462
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,217
What was the package?

463
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,635
It wasn't a what.

464
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,887
It was a who.

465
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:53,098
Frank! Frank!

466
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,808
It's that helicopter.

467
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,102
We're in an airport. So...

468
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,812
It's the same helicopter.

469
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:04,318
November niner 748 Charlie.

470
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:08,238
November niner 748 Charlie.

471
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:12,785
See? Frank, November niner 748...

472
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:13,911
Is that a 4?

473
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,329
This is a 4. Charlie.

474
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,456
Is that a 7? What is that?

475
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,083
I'll tell you what it is.

476
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,220
I told you she shouldn't
have made that phone call!

477
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,348
We lost visual on target.

478
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,933
All right. Shake the tree.

479
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,268
-You'll pay for the breakage?
-Yeah, Roger that.

480
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,126
That's right, old man!

481
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:06,171
-Old man?
-No respect.

482
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,422
Can I kill her now?

483
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,060
She called me an old man.

484
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,022
Pig! Open the pig!

485
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,238
Okay.

486
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,084
Grenade!

487
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,922
Damn satellites!

488
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,300
Boop to that!

489
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,055
Yeah, you just stay right there.

490
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,223
This is gonna be good.

491
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,866
-You okay?
-Yeah.

492
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,120
Come on, come on. Hey. All right?

493
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,581
What are you doing?

494
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,203
Old man, my ass.

495
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:02,371
God damn it!

496
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,166
-Smoke and thermals. Obstructed view.
-Signal's fading.

497
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,170
Nice shot.

498
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,048
-Thanks.
-We should get out of here.

499
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,320
You really know how to show a girl
a good time, Frank.

500
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,030
I will kill you, Marvin.

501
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,868
Take it easy, man. She likes you.

502
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,501
How can you tell?

503
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,172
Notice how she sticks around?

504
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,592
'Cause if women don't like you,
they don't stick around.

505
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,053
She doesn't have much of a choice.
Does she?

506
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,596
Sure she does.

507
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,891
Really?

508
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:06,727
You think so?

509
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:14,151
You know, if it is the CIA,

510
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,529
then there's only one place that we can go

511
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,740
to find out why they're coming after us.

512
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:20,866
Yeah.

513
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,285
We're gonna get killed there, for sure.

514
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:25,329
In or out?

515
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,290
No. Of course I'm in. I'm just saying.

516
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,420
We're gonna need some serious help.

517
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:39,593
This is not the kind of help I meant, Frank.

518
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,388
You're not actually gonna go in there,
are you?

519
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,642
I don't think I can go, Frank.

520
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:51,938
The last time they put some electrical wires

521
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,232
in some not very nice places.

522
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,323
Listen, hang onto that for me.

523
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,244
I'll be right back.

524
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:15,337
Hey.

525
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,173
Be careful.

526
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:47,661
Tell Ivan Simanov that Frank Moses is...

527
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,871
Frank Moses is here to see him.

528
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,304
I have to say...

529
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:11,059
this is the last thing I expected

530
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,146
when I got up this morning.

531
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:23,613
I have many times dreamed of killing you.

532
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,450
But now...

533
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,330
you are...

534
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,625
a pensioner.

535
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,587
Couple of years now.

536
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,714
Time passes.

537
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:44,593
As we get older,
things seem less important.

538
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,262
Still

539
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,558
I owe you

540
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,060
for killing Igor.

541
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:56,521
-Igor the Butcher.
-He was a great asset.

542
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:59,608
-He was a pig.
-He was my cousin.

543
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,902
I'm sorry.

544
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,080
To Igor.

545
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,416
The Butcher.

546
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:18,919
He's not dead.

547
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:22,839
I flipped him.

548
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:24,966
No.

549
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,385
He owns a string of 7-Elevens
in Orange County.

550
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:29,846
He weighs 500 pounds.

551
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,444
Drink.

552
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,030
Who are we drinking to now?

553
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,616
Veronique.

554
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,162
She was mine.

555
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,957
-Impossible.
-Yes!

556
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,633
Whatever she got, it was worth it.

557
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,681
I miss the old days.

558
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:20,647
I haven't killed anyone in years.

559
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,775
That's sad.

560
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,156
But

561
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:34,661
I think you are not here for the vodka.

562
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,209
I'm going to break into the CIA.

563
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,921
I need your complete
security layout of Langley.

564
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:48,675
Cracks. Codes. ID swipes.

565
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:50,760
All of it.

566
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,932
Amusing as this would be,

567
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,936
it is beyond my reach.

568
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:10,322
A favor from Frank Moses?

569
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:23,293
I can't believe you're actually
letting me come along.

570
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,963
The badges Ivan gave us
are for a General Harlow

571
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:30,175
and a female nuclear physicist
from Los Alamos.

572
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,429
Sheniqua Johnson?

573
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:36,431
You're adopted.

574
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:37,766
Okay.

575
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,230
This is so cool.

576
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:03,708
What?

577
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,252
I dropped it.

578
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,173
Freeze!

579
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,262
The General has dropped his contact lens.

580
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,350
Perhaps you'd like to help us?

581
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:23,853
Sorry.

582
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,654
Found it! I found it!

583
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,240
I found it.

584
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,338
Have a good day, sir.

585
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,090
Gentlemen.

586
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,300
My God!

587
00:50:56,554 --> 00:51:00,223
What do you suppose the punishment
is for what we're doing here?

588
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,142
Death.

589
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,644
Maybe life in prison.

590
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:06,229
Awesome.

591
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,821
Why are you holding that button?

592
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,583
The Russians give you the code?

593
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,209
No.

594
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,421
Changes every six hours.

595
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,131
Will you hold that for me for a second?

596
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,215
Yeah.

597
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,179
It's unbreakable.

598
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:43,725
Wow.

599
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:48,855
Come on.

600
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:03,953
Mr. Moses!

601
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,998
Been a long time.

602
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,501
I'm gonna need to see that Guatemala file.

603
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,002
Guatemala?

604
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:12,962
Yes.

605
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,548
I think I can help you.

606
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:17,842
Great.

607
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,058
It's been a whole new world
around here since you left.

608
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,228
Guatemala.

609
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,108
You know, you're gonna catch hell for this.

610
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,819
After what I've seen?

611
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,739
Oh, I should tell you,

612
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:43,201
there's a new guy came down here
yesterday looking for your file.

613
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,120
Name of William Cooper?

614
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,249
6'1"? Cute hair?

615
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,543
Hair was cute.

616
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,004
But I thought he looked a little tough,
though.

617
00:52:58,384 --> 00:52:59,926
You take good care of yourself, Henry.

618
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,136
You, too, Mr. Moses.

619
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,307
Change of plan.

620
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,617
Bad move, Grandpa.

621
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:32,959
I'm back

622
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,381
I'm back in the saddle again

623
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,593
I'm back

624
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:46,055
I'm back in the saddle again

625
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,808
Just looks completely different
than his profile picture.

626
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:57,650
Peeling off my boots and chaps
I'm saddle sore

627
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:01,696
Four bits gets you time in the racks
I scream for more

628
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,742
Fools' gold out of their mines
The girls are soaking wet

629
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:10,455
Not tongue's drier than mine
I'll come when I get back

630
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,248
Kordesky trained you?

631
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,416
Yeah.

632
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,001
I trained Kordesky.

633
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,172
I'm back

634
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,886
I'm back in the saddle again

635
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:39,859
Son of a bitch!

636
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,034
Seal the building. Bald, white male, 50s,

637
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,578
wearing white shirt, blue pants,
shot in the shoulder.

638
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,464
We should go.

639
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,299
We should go now.

640
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:33,621
I've got checkpoints at every exit.
What about the fire?

641
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,332
Shut off the alarm.
I told you, there is no fire!

642
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,004
-We need to evacuate.
-No, this is just a diversion.

643
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,797
You make sure everyone gets checked.

644
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:48,261
Help, help! Please come!

645
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,722
I can't stop the bleeding.

646
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:56,602
You okay, sir?

647
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,104
Make a hole!

648
00:55:58,564 --> 00:55:59,897
Make a hole!

649
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,650
Hold it. Let me see him.

650
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:04,944
It's not him.

651
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,073
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

652
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,034
Fellas, help me out, here.

653
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,928
Marvin?

654
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,395
There's still something wrong
with this guy's head, Frank.

655
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,445
You're really something, Joe.

656
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,489
Marvin, you okay?

657
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,157
I don't want to talk about it.

658
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,120
Joe? Joe who was dead Joe?

659
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:58,539
-She with us?
-Yeah.

660
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,042
Not dead.

661
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:04,337
Just retired.

662
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,761
I guess calling wasn't an option?

663
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,679
-Can we go?
-Yeah!

664
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,056
You let yourself get shot?

665
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,100
God damn it.

666
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:19,769
Out.

667
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,146
-You okay?
-Thanks, Doc.

668
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:23,648
What did he get?

669
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,611
I have no idea.

670
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:33,699
You just had your ass handed
to you by a goddamn retiree.

671
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,161
What did he do?

672
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,874
What did Moses do to earn a lethal finding?

673
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,168
I have not been read into it.

674
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:47,380
I like you, Cooper.
You're ambitious and you get results,

675
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,508
but someone just kicked in
the front door of our house,

676
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,718
so you better get your shit straight.

677
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,388
Nothing in your mission is changed.

678
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,809
You're still bleeding.

679
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,395
Must have nicked something in there.

680
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,313
This is so bad.

681
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:07,400
It's not that bad.
People get shot all the time.

682
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,777
No, they don't, they get paper cuts.

683
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,112
I mostly get shot.

684
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:14,157
We're gonna have to find somebody
to plug this leak.

685
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,913
Could go to Eagle's Nest.

686
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:23,958
Then we all get shot.

687
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:27,086
I'll just go in by myself.

688
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,088
Want a vest?

689
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:33,718
Wouldn't do any good.

690
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,631
Frank Moses.

691
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:14,258
Hi, Victoria.

692
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:20,932
Are you here to kill me?

693
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,226
No.

694
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,648
You've been shot.

695
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,575
Tell Marvin to stand down
before he gets hurt.

696
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,003
Who's the girl?

697
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:52,505
She's with me.

698
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,507
-Vicky.
-Joe!

699
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,551
Oh, Vicky. Sexy as ever.

700
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:02,515
You old snake charmer.

701
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:06,519
Sarah, this is Victoria.
Best wet work asset in the business.

702
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,105
And a true artist with an RPN.

703
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,731
What's that?

704
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,859
I kill people, dear.

705
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,322
You were lucky.

706
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:26,831
How'd you do it?

707
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,167
-What?
-How'd you make the transition?

708
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:33,838
Here you seem so calm. At ease.

709
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,340
I love it.

710
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:40,928
I love it here. I love the baking.
I love the flower arranging.

711
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:43,055
I like the routine.

712
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,561
Well...

713
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:52,606
I do get a bit restless sometimes.

714
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:59,613
I take the odd contract on the side.

715
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,659
I just can't stop.

716
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:08,622
Yeah. Tell me about it.

717
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:11,167
You can't just flip a switch
and become someone else.

718
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:12,793
Put some pressure on it.

719
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,423
So...

720
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,384
Tell me about your lady friend.

721
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,805
Makes me think that I could actually

722
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:30,478
have a life.

723
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:32,813
A real life.

724
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:36,192
Oh, Francis, you're such a romantic.

725
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:37,526
What?

726
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,862
A romantic.
It's why I've always been so fond of you.

727
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:40,946
Victoria...

728
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,699
You're all hard on the outside,
but you are...

729
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,660
You are gooey on the inside.

730
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,123
Gooey.

731
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:57,213
The entire back half of the Guatemala file
has been blacked out.

732
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:02,051
But there's a list. 11 names.
Plus one that's been redacted.

733
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,845
All dead. Except for Frank and Marvin.

734
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,848
All the names on the reporter's list
are in the file, too,

735
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,850
but she has an additional name.

736
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,477
Alexander Dunning.

737
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,729
Somebody's protecting him.

738
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:18,275
Dunning is the CEO of Browning-Orvis.

739
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,485
Gangsters.

740
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,070
Defense contractor.

741
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,530
Very connected.

742
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:27,159
If the CIA is protecting him,

743
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,370
he's under surveillance.

744
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,788
We could go see him.

745
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,331
You're not going without me.

746
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:33,833
Well...

747
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:37,670
We're getting the band back together.
That's nice.

748
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:03,404
Yeah?

749
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,031
We just got a tip. RED has a new target.

750
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,700
A tip?

751
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:09,994
FBI's on the scene.

752
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:11,495
I'm on my way.

753
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:26,218
The FBI has a lookout position
on the east perimeter.

754
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,012
<i>Copy that.</i>

755
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,245
Alexander Dunning.

756
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:56,081
Pleasure to see you, Secretary Baptiste.

757
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,958
The pleasure is with me.

758
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,089
They're in.

759
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:07,760
Frank said you wanted me with you.

760
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:10,888
Yes, I thought it might be nice
to have a bit of girl time together.

761
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,933
Get to know each other.

762
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:20,231
And I just wanted to tell you that
in all the years I've known Francis,

763
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,775
I've never seen him like this.

764
01:04:25,654 --> 01:04:27,571
So if you break his heart,

765
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,240
I will kill you.

766
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:31,575
And bury your body in the woods.

767
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:36,830
Okay.

768
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:41,627
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

769
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,841
<i>Here at Browning-Orvis,</i>

770
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:52,179
<i>we have a longstanding commitment
to humanitarian causes</i>

771
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:56,809
<i>because exemplary corporate citizenship
is our highest calling.</i>

772
01:04:57,102 --> 01:05:00,688
As a company with global reach
and global interests,

773
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:03,816
we have global responsibilities.

774
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,569
Now sometimes I'm asked,

775
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:10,990
if this commitment to ethical behavior
affects the bottom line.

776
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,993
And my answer is always the same.

777
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:15,244
Yes.

778
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,913
It makes it stronger.

779
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:22,126
This is my safe room.
Sound-proofed. Reinforced.

780
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,211
Swept for bugs daily.

781
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,046
You could fire a gun in here.

782
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,007
No one would ever know.

783
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:30,092
Mr. Dunning.

784
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:35,347
I cannot imagine a more perfect place
to conduct our business.

785
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:41,312
You do know that there's

786
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,230
a surcharge

787
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,816
for any arms deliveries

788
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:49,361
to countries that are embargoed
by the United Nations.

789
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:52,698
For every problem, monsieur,

790
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,117
there is a solution.

791
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,081
Excuse me.

792
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:07,880
What are...

793
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:11,300
<i>How many CEOs can say that?</i>

794
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,886
So how did you guys meet?

795
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,348
We started talking on the phone.

796
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:21,602
I guess I liked that it wasn't real.

797
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,480
Of course now I'm a fugitive,

798
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:27,274
the CIA wants to kill me
and I'm hiding in a hole.

799
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:32,404
I was in love with an agent once.

800
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:34,907
What happened?

801
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,327
Well, I was with MI6.

802
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,371
And the relationship wasn't...

803
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:42,539
sanctioned.

804
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:47,795
So when it came to light,
my loyalty was questioned.

805
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,421
And I was ordered to kill him.

806
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,215
It was a test.

807
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,759
What did you do?

808
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:57,638
I put three bullets in his chest.

809
01:06:58,473 --> 01:06:59,682
Okay.

810
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:03,352
Who the hell are you guys?

811
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,895
You don't remember us?

812
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:07,272
We remember you.

813
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:12,111
You're the guy whose shit we cleaned up
down in Guatemala in 1981.

814
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:18,992
And the question is,
who did you fly out of there?

815
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:22,871
You don't have any idea
what you're getting into.

816
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,916
First of all,

817
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:27,584
you can't touch me.

818
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:29,002
Sure, we can.

819
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,349
Oh, yeah.

820
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:43,767
Where'd you get this?

821
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:45,310
Home Depot.

822
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:48,105
-How much?
-Ten bucks.

823
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,899
You want nuts?

824
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:52,401
Nipples?

825
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,652
Potty trainer?

826
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:55,821
All right, stop it.

827
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,072
Nuts.

828
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:01,034
Stop it. For the love of Christ, stop it!

829
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,494
Stop already!

830
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,664
Now you got something to say?

831
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:12,296
We extracted a young lieutenant

832
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,424
who is the son of the late Senator,

833
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:18,010
James Stanton.

834
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:23,348
Robert Stanton?

835
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:25,809
Vice President of the United States.

836
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:29,813
You're saying the Vice President
killed all the people in that village?

837
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,691
Yeah. Went completely off the reservation.

838
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,818
And that New York Times reporter?

839
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:36,653
Did she pressure you?

840
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,239
Yeah. She called me. Twice.

841
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,408
So I called the V.P.

842
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:44,411
And what did you think
would happen then?

843
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,038
Oh, whatever.

844
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,207
I made him Vice President.

845
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,503
You kept your mouth shut
and the Stantons made you rich.

846
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:53,670
<i>Been working with</i>

847
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:54,797
<i>our partners in the developing world</i>

848
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,340
<i>to root out corruption and...</i>

849
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:00,302
Okay.

850
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:05,224
I will pay whatever it costs

851
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:07,184
to get rid of this thing.

852
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,437
We're not here for your money, home.

853
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:14,274
We're here because that New York Times
reporter had the list of names

854
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,693
of everybody who was in Guatemala.

855
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:19,988
And everybody on that list
has been ordered killed.

856
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,323
Except you.

857
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:24,618
I had nothing to do with that.

858
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:28,205
Don't you see?

859
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:33,794
He's trying to clean up his past
and get rid of me in one shot.

860
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:37,673
He's trying to cut me loose
before he runs for President.

861
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,967
<i>We have some
major activity out here.</i>

862
01:09:40,552 --> 01:09:41,677
<i>Looks like we're blown.</i>

863
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:00,946
We're in position.
Perimeter's set. No one's getting out.

864
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,785
They're moving a team up the east side.

865
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:08,412
Are you gonna let me talk to them?

866
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:10,539
I can negotiate something.

867
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,500
Thanks, when we want your help,
we'll get out the drain cleaner.

868
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,794
Listen, Plastic Man,

869
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:19,381
those bastards out there
probably have orders to kill me, too.

870
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:20,632
I hope so.

871
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:24,261
Why? 'Cause I'm a bad guy?

872
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:26,430
I'm scum?

873
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,098
Can I just shoot him now?

874
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:29,474
No.

875
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:32,144
You don't have people killed.

876
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:36,815
I have people killed,
I'm the bad guy. Remember?

877
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:43,822
Not worth a bullet.

878
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,123
Hello?

879
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:54,583
How's retirement, Frank?

880
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,668
It's been a real blast.

881
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,212
If we have to come in there and get you,
it's gonna be messy.

882
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:02,090
You bet. Real messy.

883
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,092
I've got my orders, Frank.

884
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,011
They come from the Vice President.

885
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:09,973
He's ordered these hits to cover up
the war crimes he committed in Guatemala.

886
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,642
I find that hard to believe.

887
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,852
How did you know you'd find me here?

888
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:16,271
Some anonymous untraceable tip?

889
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,025
Here's the deal, Frank.

890
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:23,362
You're gonna walk out that front door
and give yourself up.

891
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,739
You have my word no one will shoot you.

892
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:29,576
I'll personally take you in and
you will get to tell your side of the story.

893
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,412
You got 60 seconds to decide.

894
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:37,584
What's it look like?

895
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:39,211
There's no clean exit.

896
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,797
They seem to be coming from everywhere.

897
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,389
If we had a distraction,
I could cover you to the woods.

898
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,862
Looks like there's not a lot of options, kid.

899
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,033
I mean

900
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,162
somebody's gonna have to make
the hard choice

901
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:15,580
if weâ€™re gonna get out of here alive.

902
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,763
Been wild.

903
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,059
Wild and crazy.

904
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:39,604
But I wouldn't want it any other way.

905
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,280
An honor.

906
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,788
Good luck.

907
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:07,466
Tell your men to hold their fire.

908
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,009
I'm coming out.

909
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:13,472
He's coming out. All units, hold fire.

910
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,557
Repeat, all units, hold fire.

911
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:16,975
Roger that.

912
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:23,815
Get behind.

913
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:27,486
Come out now. I've got you covered.

914
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:45,545
Who fired the shot?

915
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:13,573
Tell me when the boys make cover,
we'll move.

916
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:16,618
Now.

917
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,698
They've got Sarah.

918
01:14:58,202 --> 01:14:59,870
Frank, you're no good to her dead.

919
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:01,288
We gotta move.

920
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,458
Come!

921
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:08,670
Now is not time to waste.

922
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:10,463
Ivan?

923
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:16,469
It's nice to see you again, Ivan.

924
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:17,929
Did he just call you "bunny"?

925
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,559
Life sometimes is complicated.

926
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,068
To Joe.

927
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:35,739
Joe.

928
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:49,419
Not to push the bounds of propriety,

929
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:51,379
but don't you think
we ought to discuss the fact that

930
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:55,258
the CIA's being used by the Vice President
as his personal hit squad

931
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:58,678
and that they'll do whatever they can
to find us and kill us?

932
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:02,098
Options?

933
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:05,769
We could go public.

934
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:10,273
Yeah, right.
That didn't work very well for the reporter.

935
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:12,400
And what about Frank's girlfriend?

936
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:14,194
They'll kill her so fast.

937
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:18,531
First they'll interrogate her.
They probably already got the wires.

938
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:21,868
Then give her a little snorkel.
Give her a jump.

939
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,662
-Bring in the dent.
-Marvin!

940
01:16:25,373 --> 01:16:28,291
God! You are such an idiot.

941
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,181
I want to show you something.

942
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,899
This was done to me by the love of my life.

943
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:57,028
It seems that what we had
was not meant to be.

944
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,448
But now she sits

945
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:03,368
outside my house

946
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,913
drinking vodka.

947
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,545
Three bullets in the chest.

948
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:17,132
When I woke alive,

949
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:21,094
I knew she still loved me.

950
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,222
Or else it would have been the head.

951
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:28,143
It was big risk for her, of course,

952
01:17:28,936 --> 01:17:33,398
but one does crazy things for love.

953
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:39,404
Do not fear for your love, my friend.

954
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,407
With a small dedicated group,

955
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:45,410
there is nothing
that cannot be accomplished.

956
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:48,038
Let me be blunt.

957
01:17:48,456 --> 01:17:51,416
Nobody knows you're here. You don't exist.

958
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:53,960
And unless you cooperate fully,

959
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:56,421
there's nothing I can't do to you.

960
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,923
-Sir.
-Not now.

961
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,759
Moses is on the phone.

962
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:04,637
Okay. Trace is running.

963
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:11,644
Moses.

964
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,563
Here's the thing, Cooper.

965
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:18,276
With age comes a certain perspective.

966
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:22,864
I'd be a liar if I said there wasn't a time
when I was exactly like you.

967
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:24,741
Blind ambition.

968
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:26,409
Misplaced trust.

969
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,370
Why are you telling me this?

970
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,289
It might help me to decide what to do next.

971
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:32,457
Just keep it going.

972
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:34,250
Why? What are you thinking about?

973
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:36,961
Our business is a very hard one.

974
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:38,797
But it was never

975
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:42,008
the killing or the stress,

976
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:43,927
or the bad pay that bothered me.

977
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,137
What was it, Frank?

978
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:49,432
It's how anything that you love

979
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:51,518
can be taken away from you.

980
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:54,604
It taught me never to care.

981
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,147
Never to invest.

982
01:18:57,858 --> 01:18:59,651
Then I met this woman.

983
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:01,820
Sarah.

984
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:05,698
And now you have her.

985
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:09,285
Now I can't think of anything
more horrible

986
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:13,164
than to know that your enemies
can hurt someone that you love.

987
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:16,501
The feeling is almost indescribable.

988
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,134
You still there, Cooper?

989
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:27,345
You're at my house.

990
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:37,772
Almost indescribable, isn't it?

991
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:41,776
Please.

992
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,280
Please don't hurt my family.

993
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,199
If anything happens to Sarah,

994
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:51,536
I will rip everything you love
out of your life.

995
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,497
And then I'll kill you.

996
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:59,043
I swear to you, I will keep Sarah safe.

997
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:01,212
We don't have much time.

998
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:02,755
Do you understand that?

999
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,427
What are you gonna do, Frank?

1000
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,096
I'm gonna kill the Vice President.

1001
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:11,931
What are you gonna do?

1002
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:20,231
Move! Move!

1003
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:27,614
Mom!

1004
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:36,766
Frank left this for me.

1005
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,478
Where did he get it from?

1006
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:45,149
The secure records depository of the CIA.

1007
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:57,662
Look, Sarah.

1008
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,000
I know Frank's been right
about a few things.

1009
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:06,212
But he's about to cross a line
from which there's no turning back.

1010
01:22:07,214 --> 01:22:10,842
Right now,
you have an opportunity to help him.

1011
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:14,220
You need to tell me everything you know.

1012
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,681
Because if I can't stop him,

1013
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,601
I'm gonna have to kill him.

1014
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:30,486
Do you know who Frank Moses is?
I mean, really is?

1015
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,239
Do you know what he's done?

1016
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:41,956
You're asking me for help? That is so lame.

1017
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:45,835
He's gonna eat you for lunch.

1018
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,218
She's never gonna trust us.

1019
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:57,221
I can't blame her. The tip off was a trap.

1020
01:22:57,431 --> 01:22:59,724
Someone's got us dancing like marionettes.

1021
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:07,523
Just like Moses called it.

1022
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,525
Yeah.

1023
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,112
He will take a shot at the V.P.

1024
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:15,907
That's a problem for the Secret Service.

1025
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:20,828
Moses'll take them apart.

1026
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,581
Plug me into their detail.

1027
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:26,709
You got it.

1028
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:28,628
What about her?

1029
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:32,882
I'll keep her close. Protected. Off the grid.

1030
01:23:40,099 --> 01:23:41,307
I put a few things away.

1031
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:43,601
Just in case.

1032
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:44,727
Frank.

1033
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:52,235
Swedish K.

1034
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:56,739
Now that is exciting.

1035
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,243
Explosives?

1036
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:01,953
Just past the RPGs.

1037
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:03,788
I love you, man.

1038
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,417
-Make yourself at home.
-The Vice President's gonna love this.

1039
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:21,597
Nice to see you, too.

1040
01:24:57,384 --> 01:24:58,426
Thank you.

1041
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:08,686
Oh. I'm sorry.

1042
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,856
Sorry. Silly.

1043
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:15,735
Thank you, ma'am.

1044
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:31,584
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

1045
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:41,719
Welcome, Ms. Brown.

1046
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:46,349
It's a pleasure to have you
at our Victory Fund Gala.

1047
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,559
Oh, I'm so looking forward to it.

1048
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:54,899
Raptor is cleared for entry.

1049
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:57,401
After you, Mr. Vice President.

1050
01:25:57,611 --> 01:26:02,406
<i>A true war hero,
a fabulous friend and a wonderful leader.</i>

1051
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:06,452
<i>And so it's with great pleasure
I introduce to you,</i>

1052
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:09,205
vice President Robert Stanton.

1053
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:14,085
I love you, sir!

1054
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:20,758
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you so much for being here.

1055
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,426
I'm gonna keep this short and sweet

1056
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:24,679
so you'll actually write those checks
you've been promising.

1057
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:31,018
Seriously, though, great to see you all.

1058
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:34,230
It's the wonderful people here tonight

1059
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:36,065
that got us into the White House
in the first place.

1060
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:38,359
And I believe
it's this wonderful group of people

1061
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:41,571
who will keep us there
for a long, long time!

1062
01:26:43,991 --> 01:26:45,783
My good friends,

1063
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:48,703
I am proud to announce that I will
be forming an exploratory committee

1064
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:52,373
with the primary goal of seeking
a nomination for the Presidency.

1065
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:05,136
We've had a great journey together.

1066
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:09,348
But I firmly believe
that the best is still to come.

1067
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:11,684
God bless you all.

1068
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:13,769
God bless America!

1069
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:39,503
Hello, bunny.

1070
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:42,089
Moves like that could get you killed.

1071
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:46,385
Your radiance tonight
renders me almost speechless.

1072
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,511
Almost.

1073
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:53,059
What are you grinning at?

1074
01:27:53,936 --> 01:27:57,229
I've always dreamed
of killing an American President.

1075
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:58,522
Vice President.

1076
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:00,024
Whatever.

1077
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:05,237
Having you in my arms once again,
I get carried away.

1078
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:06,530
Really?

1079
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,326
Tell me you love me.

1080
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:13,955
It's been a long time, Ivan.

1081
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:15,790
Blink of an eye.

1082
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:20,461
Ivan.

1083
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:22,380
The music has stopped.

1084
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:24,548
Is it?

1085
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:29,220
To work then.

1086
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,686
Ivan!

1087
01:28:51,785 --> 01:28:53,119
Do you smell that?

1088
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:18,060
-This area is off limits.
-No, it's fine. It's fine.

1089
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:19,395
You'll have to turn around.

1090
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:21,105
No, it's fine.

1091
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:23,315
It's all right. I'm sure I'm allowed.

1092
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,485
You'll have to go back up, ma'am,
or I'll have to treat you as a threat.

1093
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,945
Where exactly is the threat?

1094
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:49,008
Good to see you.

1095
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:50,384
Oh, my God!

1096
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:53,471
Gas! I smell gas!

1097
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:55,931
Gas! Gas!

1098
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:57,349
Gas!

1099
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:08,527
Stand aside.

1100
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:13,282
Primary exit blocked. Secondary, move.

1101
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:14,992
Move! Move! Move!

1102
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:22,041
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

1103
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:05,167
Go.

1104
01:31:08,046 --> 01:31:09,380
What the hell are they using?

1105
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:33,070
Get back up in here
to the north stairwell, now!

1106
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:54,008
Ah, yes.

1107
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:05,436
Move to the other limo. I'll cover you.

1108
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:29,043
We have to go. Now! Now!

1109
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:37,635
Approaching target from the rear.

1110
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:04,578
Outside!

1111
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:07,081
Secret Service,
everybody down!

1112
01:33:31,982 --> 01:33:33,107
Cover us! We're moving now!

1113
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:36,860
Come on! Move!

1114
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:37,987
Go!

1115
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:46,203
I remember
the Secret Service being tougher.

1116
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:47,454
Me, too.

1117
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:52,126
-Okay?
-Yeah.

1118
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:01,385
Marvin.

1119
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:05,723
Bugger!

1120
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:37,629
-Almost there.
-Marvin.

1121
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:38,964
We gotta move.

1122
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:43,093
You're on your own. I'm no use anymore.

1123
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:46,597
Good luck. Go on.

1124
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:52,519
Let's move!

1125
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:55,522
Are you hit, sir?

1126
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:58,108
-Are you hit?
-I'm fine! Just get me the hell out of here.

1127
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:20,547
Perhaps I could be of assistance?

1128
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:35,771
I love you.

1129
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:37,398
I know.

1130
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:45,906
Freeze!

1131
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:53,580
What the...

1132
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:58,544
Go. Go!

1133
01:36:00,839 --> 01:36:01,880
Go!

1134
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:15,144
Get in! Get in!

1135
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:16,937
Go, go, go!

1136
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:23,694
Stop the car! Stop...

1137
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,404
Don't you dare stop! You keep going!

1138
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:27,489
Stop the car! Pull over!

1139
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:37,875
I wanna know
what the hell that was all about!

1140
01:36:58,271 --> 01:37:00,272
-Burbacher!
-Get him off!

1141
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:02,065
Pull over!

1142
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:05,611
Raptor is secure.

1143
01:37:22,504 --> 01:37:23,712
Who are you?

1144
01:37:23,922 --> 01:37:25,756
One of the men you ordered killed.

1145
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:29,551
I don't know what you're talking about.

1146
01:37:29,928 --> 01:37:31,470
Guatemala.

1147
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:34,181
I was there.

1148
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:41,855
Well...

1149
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:50,155
I'm sure we can negotiate something.

1150
01:37:50,573 --> 01:37:52,366
Starting to come back to you now, is it?

1151
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:56,370
If you're looking for revenge...

1152
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:58,622
This is not about revenge.

1153
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:05,754
Are you gonna kill me?

1154
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:09,633
Not just you.

1155
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:22,020
Yeah?

1156
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:24,147
I'm at the Evanston power plant.

1157
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,775
You have 15 minutes to bring me Sarah.

1158
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:29,111
Or I kill the vice President.

1159
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:35,325
He just made contact. He wants the girl.

1160
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:38,161
Evanston Power Station. 15 minutes.

1161
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:40,330
You better alert Secret Service.

1162
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,665
Copy that.

1163
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:44,793
Secret Service is en route.

1164
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:03,687
All right, come on.

1165
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:09,318
Where's Sarah?

1166
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:11,028
She's on her way.

1167
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:14,906
It's over, Frank.

1168
01:39:15,533 --> 01:39:17,868
Any minute
the whole world is gonna drop on you.

1169
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:20,287
We'll see.

1170
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:46,563
Hey, tough guy.

1171
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:49,650
Surprised to see me?

1172
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:52,361
What the hell's this?

1173
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:53,528
Alex...

1174
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:57,741
Just give him what he wants.
I can't do this anymore.

1175
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:02,913
You ordered these killings, not me.

1176
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:06,541
I don't want to have
anything to do with this anymore.

1177
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:13,757
You shot me.

1178
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:16,176
Shut up.

1179
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:23,100
I loved watching you being a good guy.

1180
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:27,104
Kicking ass for your country.

1181
01:40:28,398 --> 01:40:31,358
It showed a spectacular lack of vision.

1182
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:33,777
The girl goes free.

1183
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:36,154
That'll cost you a gun.

1184
01:40:41,411 --> 01:40:43,120
A life for a life.

1185
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:49,459
I tore up all those checks.

1186
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,087
I know.

1187
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:56,967
I just wanted to talk to you.

1188
01:41:04,142 --> 01:41:05,142
Cooper,

1189
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:07,477
cuff him.

1190
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:22,909
Wilkes told me you had promise.

1191
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:25,287
Okay, here's how it goes.

1192
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:27,998
Moses just shot the V.P.

1193
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:30,417
You kill him and the girl,

1194
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:33,170
and you're head of the CIA.

1195
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:36,089
Cooper.

1196
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:40,385
This is gonna happen either way.

1197
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,347
Fuck you, Cynthia.

1198
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,573
Thanks.

1199
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:49,913
This gonna be a problem?

1200
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:55,001
No.

1201
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:57,170
I got it...

1202
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:00,006
Grandpa.

1203
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:12,435
Feel better now?

1204
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:13,770
Yeah.

1205
01:43:14,438 --> 01:43:16,231
Wanna get pancakes?

1206
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,987
Can you believe it? It all worked out.

1207
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:25,657
Something bad is gonna happen very soon.

1208
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:28,493
Maybe not. Wait a second.

1209
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:30,912
Nobody's chasing us.

1210
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:34,332
No one's trying to kill us.

1211
01:43:35,293 --> 01:43:37,836
I think we just got our lives back.

1212
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:40,088
Almost.

1213
01:43:41,507 --> 01:43:43,758
You still owe me a small favor.

1214
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:44,968
Oh, Ivan!

1215
01:43:46,137 --> 01:43:47,637
His timing is terrible.

1216
01:43:48,097 --> 01:43:50,223
You gave a favor to him?

1217
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:54,269
Just a tiny little nuclear problem
in Moldova.

1218
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,314
Can we go?

1219
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:02,611
Yes. We can go.

1220
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:35,685
I told you
something bad was gonna happen.

1221
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:37,228
Keep your dress on.

1222
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:40,899
Moldova sucks.

1223
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:42,609
Moldova sucks!

1224
01:44:44,195 --> 01:44:46,529
Next time,
your girlfriend can wear the dress.

1225
01:44:47,305 --> 01:45:47,377
