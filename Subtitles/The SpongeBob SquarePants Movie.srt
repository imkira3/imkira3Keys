00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,561
Dinghy ahoy.

00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:10,372
Dinghy off the port bow.

5
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:14,168
- Dinghy off the port bow!
- Dinghy off the port bow!

6
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:15,469
Dinghy off the port bow.

00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:18,044
- Captain, dinghy off the...
- Dinghy.

00:01:19,148 --> 00:01:21,117
I got it!

9
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:28,047
I got it.

10
00:01:29,726 --> 00:01:31,661
Where is it?

11
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:33,623
It's right here, captain.

12
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:41,436
I never thought I'd see it
with me own eye.

I'd rather not discuss

Look, there he is.

36
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:20,544
Talk to me, Krabs.

37
00:03:20,748 --> 00:03:24,583
It started out as a simple order:
A Krabby Patty with cheese.

38
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,652
When the customer took a bite,

39
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:29,619
no cheese!

40
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:34,220
Get ahold of yourself, Eugene.
I'm going in.

41
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,791
Take it easy, friend. I'm the manager
of this establishment.

42
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:41,995
Everything's gonna be just fine.

43
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:45,733
- I'm really scared here, man.
- You got a name?

44
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:47,535
- Phil.
- You got a family, Phil?

45
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:53,609
Come on, Phil, stay with me.
Let's hear about that family.

46
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:56,549
I got a wife
and two beautiful children.

47
00:03:56,755 --> 00:04:00,054
That's what it's all about.
I want you to do me a favor, Phil.

What?

49
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,723
Say cheese.

50
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:18,806
Order up.

51
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:24,379

the new manager.

SpongeBob!
What are you doing in here?

70
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,205
I have to tell you something,
Squidward.

71
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,506
Whatever it is,
can't it wait until we get to work?

72
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,707
- There's no shower at work.
- What do you want?

73
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,681
I just wanted to say
I'll be thanking you

74
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,981
in my managerial acceptance
speech today.

75
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,750
Get out!

76
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,826
Okay. I'll see you at the ceremony.

77
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,522
That sounds like the manager
of the new Krusty Krab 2.

78
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,702
Oops. Hold on.

79
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:45,168
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Oh, thanks, Patrick.

80
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:49,241
And tonight, after my big promotion,
we're gonna party till we're purple.

00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:50,969
I love being purple!

82
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,172
We're going to the place
where all the action is.

83
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:56,749
- You don't mean...?

00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:16,467
I'd better get going.

I'm ready. Promotion.

89

Good luck, SpongeBob.
Hey, look for me at the ceremony.

90
00:07:23,114 --> 00:07:25,412

Hello, Bikini Bottom!

93
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,690
Perch Perkins here, coming
to you live from in front of

94
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:35,087
The Krusty Krab restaurant,

95
00:07:35,294 --> 00:07:37,728
for years the only place
to get a delicious

96
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,867
and mouthwatering Krabby Patty.
Until today, that is.

97
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:46,733
That's right, folks. Longtime owner
Mr. Krabs is opening a new restaurant

98
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,034
called The Krusty Krab 2.

99
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:54,006
First of all,
congratulations, Mr. Krabs.

100
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:56,240
Hello. I like money.

101
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:59,181
What inspired you to build
a second Krusty Krab

102
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,378
right next door to the original?

103
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,080
Money.

104
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:05,353
Curses!

105
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,788
It's not fair.

106
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:11,592
Krabs is being interviewed
by Perch Perkins,

107
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,531
and I've never even had
one customer!

108
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:25,442
<i>Don't get worked up again, Plankton,
I just mopped the floors.</i>

109
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,053
Oh, Karen, my computer wife,
if only I could have managed to steal

110
00:08:30,254 --> 00:08:32,017
the secret to Krabs' success,

111
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:35,557
the formula for the Krabby Patty.

112
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:40,760
Then people would line up
to eat at my restaurant.

113
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:43,629
Lord knows I've tried.

114
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:49,134
I've exhausted every evil plan
in my filing cabinet...

115
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:52,277
<i>...from A to Y.
- A to Y?</i>

116
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:54,413
Yeah, A to Y.
You know, the alphabet.

117
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:56,082
<i>What about Z?</i>

118
00:08:56,283 --> 00:09:00,219
<i>- Z?
- Z. The letter after Y.</i>

119
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:02,617
W, X, Y,

120
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:04,086
Z. Plan Z!

121
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:07,728
<i>- Here it is, just like you said.
- Oh, boy.</i>

122
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:13,458
It's evil.

123
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:16,467
It's diabolical.

124
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:18,503
It's lemon-scented.

125
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,303
This Plan Z can't possibly fail!

126
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:26,076
So enjoy today, Mr. Krabs,

127
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:29,150
because by tomorrow,
I'll have the formula.

128
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,150
Then everyone will eat
at the Chum Bucket,

129
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:34,017
and I will rule the world!

130
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:37,752
All hail Plankton. All hail Plank...!

131
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:41,830
I'm ready. Promotion.
I'm ready. Promotion.

132
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:44,058
I think I stepped in something.

133
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:51,603
Not in something,
on someone, you twit.

134
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,004
Sorry, Plankton.

135
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:56,042
Are you on your way
to the grand-opening ceremony?

136
00:09:56,249 --> 00:09:59,707
No, I am not on my way over
to the grand-opening ceremony.

137
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,947
I'm busy planning to rule the world!

138
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:07,588
Well, good luck with that.

139
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:11,822
I'm ready. Promotion.
I'm ready. Promotion.

140
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:13,660
Stupid kid.

141
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:18,304
Welcome. Welcome, everyone,
to the grand opening

142
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:21,601
of The Krusty Krab 2.

143
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:26,140
- We paid $9 for this?
- I paid 10.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,317
Now, before we begin
with the ribbon-cutting,

145
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:32,147
I'd like to announce the name
of our new manager.

146
00:10:32,355 --> 00:10:34,880
Yay! Yeah!

147
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:40,794
Yeah! Now we're talking! Yeah!

148
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,466
Yes. Well, anyway...

149
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:48,935
The new manager is a loyal,
hard-working employee.

150
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:50,671
<i>Yes.</i>

151
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,036
The obvious choice for the job.

152
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:54,438
<i>He's right.</i>

153
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:58,014
A name you all know.
It starts with an S.

154
00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:02,153
<i>- That's me.
- Please welcome our new manager...</i>

155
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,447
...Squidward Tentacles.

156
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:08,219
Yes! Yeah!

157
00:11:09,262 --> 00:11:11,594
Oh, better luck next time, buddy.

158
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:17,035
Yeah! All right!

159
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,074
People of Bikini Bottom,
as the manager of...

00:11:23,277 --> 00:11:24,471
SpongeBob.

161
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:27,945
Hold the phone, folks, I'm getting an
important news flash from Mr. Krabs.

162
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,845
Go ahead, Mr. K.

163
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:33,246
I'm making a complete what
of myself?

164
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:38,523
The most embarrassing thing
you've ever seen?

165
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:41,124
And now it's worse
because I'm repeating

166
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:43,060
everything you say
into the microphone?

167
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:47,430
Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob,
you didn't get the job.

168
00:11:47,737 --> 00:11:52,835
- What?
- You did not get the job.

169
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:55,937
But... But why?

170
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,282
SpongeBob, you're a great fry cook,

171
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:02,783
but I gave the job to Squidward
because being manager

172
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,115
is a big responsibility.

173
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:08,383
Well, let's face it, he's more...

174
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,789
...mature than you.
- I'm not...

175
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,294
...mature?

176
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,956
Lad, I mean this
in the nicest of ways,

177
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,864
but there's a word for what you are,

178
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,629
and that word is...

179
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,603
Now, let's see...

180
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,506
- Dork?
- No, wait, that's not right. Not a dork.

181
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,545
- A goofball?
- Closer, but no, no, no.

182
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,217
- A ding-a-ling.
- Wing nut.

183
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:32,181
A Knucklehead McSpazatron.

184
00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:34,014
Okay, that's enough.

185
00:12:34,222 --> 00:12:38,283
Look, what I'm trying to say is,
you're just a kid.

186
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:41,224
And to be a manager,
you have to be a man.

187
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,830
Otherwise they'd call it "kid-ager. "

188
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:47,366
You understand-ager?
I mean, you understand?

189
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:50,629
I guess so, Mr. Krabs.

190
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:54,137
SpongeBob?

191
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:57,370
I'm ready. Depression.

192
00:12:57,581 --> 00:13:00,483
I'm ready. Depression.

193
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:02,510
Poor kid.

194
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,850
Hooray for SpongeBob!

195
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:13,663
Hooray for SpongeBob!

196
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:20,096
Let's hear it for SpongeBob!

197
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:21,534
Hello?

198
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:23,902
Where'd everybody go?

199
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,738
Did I miss something?

200
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:29,414
Did you see my butt?

201
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,813
<i>Later that evening...</i>

202
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:36,423
Time to put Plan Z into effect.

203
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:41,925
Starting at the undersea castle
of King Neptune.

204
00:13:55,478 --> 00:13:56,843
Oh, right.

205
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:59,776
The royal court is now in session.

206
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:02,041
Bring the prisoner forward.

207
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:11,757
So you have confessed to the crime
of touching the king's crown.

208
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:13,726
- Yes, but...
- But what?

209
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:17,800
But it's my job, Your Highness.
I'm the royal crown polisher.

210
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:22,336
Well, then I guess
I can't execute you.

211
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,908
- Twenty years in the dungeon it is.
- Daddy.

212
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:28,846
You're free to go.

213
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:31,107
Bless you, Princess Mindy.

214
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:36,349
Mindy, how dare you defy me.

215
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:37,989
Why do you have to be so mean?

216
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:41,922
I am the king.
I must enforce the laws of the sea.

217
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:44,689
Father, I wish you'd try
a little love and compassion

218
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:46,423
instead of these harsh punishments.

219
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:48,465
That would be nice.

220
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:50,637
Squire, clear the room.

221
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:53,774
I wish to speak
to my daughter alone.

222
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,644
What is this, Mindy?

223
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,939
- Your crown?
- And what does this crown do?

224
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:03,675
- Covers your bald spot.
- It's not bald, it's

225
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:05,183
thinning.

226
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:10,792
This crown does much more
than cover a slightly receding hairline.

227
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:16,399
No, this crown entitles the one who
wears it to be in charge of the sea.

228
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,830
One day, you will wear this crown.

229
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:20,128
I'm gonna be bald?

230
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,799
Thinning!

231
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:24,601
Anyway, the point is,
you won't wear it

232
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:28,074
until you learn how to rule
with an iron fist.

233
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,179
Like your father.

234
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:33,980
Dad, your "crown"...

235
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:37,419
What the...?

236
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:39,716
My crown!

237
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:42,958
Someone has stolen
the royal crown!

238
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:45,723
I got it. I got it.

239
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:00,343
Hey, all you Goobers,
it's time to say howdy

240
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:06,317
to your favorite undersea peanut,
Goofy Goober.

241
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,688
Howdy, Goofy Goober!

242
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:14,192
Hey, fellow Goofy Goobers.
Time to sing.

243
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:19,596
<i>Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah
You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

244
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:24,137
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

245
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:40,650
All right. Get it together, old boy.

246
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:44,818
I know. I'll just stop thinking about it.

247
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,898
Hey, you know,
I actually feel a little better.

248
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:49,932
I don't even remember
why I was sad.

249
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:54,197
Hey, it's the new
Krusty Krab 2 manager.

250
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:59,672
Wow, the pressure's
already setting in.

251
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,110
No, Pat, you don't understand.

252
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:03,908
I didn't get the promotion.

253
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:05,910
What? Why?

254
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,521
Mr. Krabs thinks I'm a kid.

255
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:11,858
- What? That's insane.
- I know.

256
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,325
Well, saying you're a kid,
it's like saying I'm a kid.

257
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,490
- Here's your Goober Meal, sir.
- I'm supposed to get a toy with this.

258
00:17:19,702 --> 00:17:21,260
Thanks.

259
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,803
I'm gonna head home, Pat.
The celebration's off.

260
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,808
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm not in a Goober mood.

261
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:31,503
Okay, see you.

262
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:35,151
And here's your Triple
Gooberberry Sunrise, sir.

263
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:39,247
Triple Gooberberry Sunrise, huh?

264
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:41,254
I guess I could use one of those.

265
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:43,154
Now you're talking.

266
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:46,728
Hey, waiter, we need
another one over here.

267
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:49,162
There you go.

268
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,703
Boy, Pat, that hit the spot.

269
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,474
- I'm feeling better already.
- Yeah.

270
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,811
Waiter, let's get
another round over here.

271
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:13,991
Oh, Mr. Waiter. Two more, please.

272
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:19,396
Waiter.

273
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:23,362
Oh, waiter.

274
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:25,437
Waiter.

275
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,904
Waiter.

276
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:31,375
- Waiter!
- Why do I always get the nuts?

277
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:35,711
All right, folks, this one goes out
to my two bestest friends

278
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:37,510
in the whole world:

279
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,554
Patrick and this big peanut guy.

280
00:18:40,757 --> 00:18:42,850
It's a little ditty called...

281
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,292
..."Waiter!"

282
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:51,865
Hey. Hey, get up.

283
00:18:52,503 --> 00:18:54,095
Hey, come on, buddy.
I wanna go home.

284
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:56,567
Come on, pal.

285
00:18:58,376 --> 00:19:00,139
Oh, my head.

286
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:02,678
Listen to me. It's 8 in the morning.

287
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:04,576
Go scrape up your friend
and get going.

288
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:06,876
My friend?

289
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:10,487
Patrick. Hey, what's up, buddy?

290
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,887
Wait, you said 8:00.

291
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:18,155
I'm late for work.
Mr. Krabs is gonna be...

292
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,530
Mr. Krabs.

293
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:25,495
Now, pay attention, Squidward.

294
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:29,665
As new manager, you've gotta keep
a sharp eye out for paying customers.

295
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:30,844
Yawn.

296
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:36,410
What's this? King Neptune is riding
toward The Krusty Krab at lunchtime.

297
00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:38,415
He's got money.

298
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:44,415
Stay in the coach, daughter.
This won't take long.

299
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:46,822
Daddy, please.
I think you're overreacting.

300
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,625
Silence, Mindy.
I know what I'm doing.

301
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,699
- Squire.
- Yes, Your Highness.

302
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:55,371
Have this pole executed at once.

303
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:59,564
A hundred and one dollars
for a Krabby Patty?

304
00:19:59,777 --> 00:20:03,145
With cheese, Mr. Squidward,
with cheese.

305
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:08,619
Greeting, subjects.

306
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,516
I seek the one known
as Eugene Krabs.

307
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:14,818
May he present himself
to me at once.

308
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:19,123
I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness.
Would you like to order something?

309
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:22,495
Nay! I'm on to you, Krabs!

310
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:25,763
You have stolen the royal crown,
you cannot deny.

311
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:27,496
For, clever as you are,

312
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:31,906
you left one damning piece of evidence
at the scene of the crime.

313
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:34,843
"I stole your crown.
Signed, Eugene Krabs. "

314
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:37,574
Relinquish the royal crown
to me at once.

315
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:40,777
But... But this is crazy. I didn't do it.

316
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:44,755
<i>Ahoy, this is Eugene Krabs.
Leave a message.</i>

317
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,158
<i>Hi, Mr. Krabs. This is Clay,
the guy you sold Neptune's crown to.</i>

318
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:52,459
<i>Yeah, I just wanted to say
thanks again for selling me the crown.</i>

319
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,070
<i>Neptune's crown.
I sold it to a guy in Shell City,</i>

320
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:59,105
<i>and I just wanted to say thanks again
for selling me the crown.</i>

321
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:01,243
<i>Neptune's crown.</i>

322
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:05,109
<i>Which is now in Shell City.
Goodbye.</i>

323
00:21:08,552 --> 00:21:10,281
Don't you just hate wrong numbers?

324
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:13,252
My crown is in
the forbidden Shell City?!

325
00:21:16,428 --> 00:21:19,625
Plan Z. I love Plan Z.

326
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:25,596
Prepare to burn, Krabs.

327
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:29,332
Wait, Neptune.
Please, I'm begging you.

328
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:33,273
I ain't a crook.
Ask anyone, they'll vouch for me.

329
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,810
Very well, then.

330
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:39,646
Before I turn this conniving
crustacean into fishmeal,

331
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:44,916
who here has anything to say
about Eugene Krabs?

332
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:51,657
I've got something to say
about Mr. Krabs.

333
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:54,562
SpongeBob, me boy,
you've come just in time.

334
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:57,238
- Pardon me, miss.
- Please, tell King Neptune

335
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,135
all about me.

336
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:03,710
I have worked for Mr. Krabs
for many years

337
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:07,907
and always thought
he was a great boss.

338
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,517
You see? A great boss.

339
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:14,349
I now realize
that he's a great big jerk!

340
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:17,652
I deserve that manager's job!

341
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:22,925
But you didn't give it to me,
because you say I'm a kid.

342
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:27,196
Well, I am 100-percent man!

343
00:22:27,406 --> 00:22:33,311
And this man has got
something to say to you.

344
00:22:41,054 --> 00:22:44,751
There. I think I made my point.

345
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:47,119
Anyone else?

346
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:49,558
No? Well, then.

347
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:56,728
Me pants are on fire!

348
00:22:56,937 --> 00:22:59,304
Me underwear's on fire!

349
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,806
I'm on fire!

350
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:05,504
Oh, yeah.

351
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:09,651
And now, Eugene Krabs, you will...

352
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:11,114
Wait.

353
00:23:12,021 --> 00:23:14,114
I'm flattered you would do this
on my account,

354
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:17,053
but being manager
isn't worth killing Mr. Krabs over.

355
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,857
Quiet, fool! Mr. Krabs stole my crown,
and now it's in Shell City.

356
00:23:22,065 --> 00:23:24,966
- That's why he must die.
- Doesn't it seem a little harsh

357
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:26,601
to kill someone over a crown?

358
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:30,740
You don't understand. My crown
is a symbol of my king-like authority.

359
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,536
And between you and me...

360
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,144
...my hair is thinning a bit.

361
00:23:35,346 --> 00:23:39,681
Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not
that notice... Bald. Bald.

362
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,752
- Bald! Bald!
- Bald! Bald!

363
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:44,717
My eyes!

364
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,516
All right, all right.

365
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,522
King Neptune, sir?

366
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:52,095
Would you spare Mr. Krabs' life
if I went to get your crown back?

367
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:55,632
You, go to Shell City?

368
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:04,508
No one who's gone to Shell City
has ever returned.

369
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:09,115
What makes you think you could?
You're just a kid.

370
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:12,216
But I'm not a kid. I can do it.

371
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:15,083
Run along, I have a crab to cook.

372
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:18,550
No! I won't let you.

373
00:24:19,328 --> 00:24:20,591
Very well, then.

374
00:24:20,797 --> 00:24:23,823
I'll have to fry you both.

375
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:25,330
Daddy, stop it.

376
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:28,661
Can't you get through one day
without executing someone?

377
00:24:28,871 --> 00:24:31,670
Mindy. I told you
to stay in the carriage.

378
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,467
Where's your love and compassion?

379
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:35,435
Look at this little guy.

380
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:39,082
He's willing to risk his life
to find your crown and save his boss.

381
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:41,514
- But, daughter, I...
- Please, Father?

382
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,655
At least let him try.
What have you got to lose?

383
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:47,984
Might I remind you
of your special problem?

384
00:24:48,193 --> 00:24:52,426
- Bald! Bald! Bald!
- Bald!

385
00:24:52,632 --> 00:24:54,224
- Bald! Bald!
- My eyes!

386
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:55,900
All right.

387
00:24:56,102 --> 00:24:57,535
Very well, Mindy.

388
00:24:57,737 --> 00:24:59,227
I'll give him a chance.

389
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:02,704
But when your little champion
fails to return,

390
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:06,276
I get to splatter this crab
all over the walls.

391
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,974
And as for you, be back here
with my crown in exactly ten days.

392
00:25:11,184 --> 00:25:12,709
- He can do it in nine.
- Eight.

393
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,114
- Seven.
- Six.

394
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:16,347
- Patrick!
- Patrick!

395
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:17,854
Six it is, then.

396
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,186
- Five.
- Patrick, shush.

397
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:24,730
Until then, the crab shall remain
frozen where he now stands.

398
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:26,901
No, wait. I'm begging you.

399
00:25:29,405 --> 00:25:32,466
Who turned on the AC? Mr. Krabs!

400
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,535
Oh, no, this is terrible.

401
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:37,406
Who's gonna sign my paycheck?

402
00:25:37,614 --> 00:25:39,104
Come along, Mindy.

403
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:43,015
Listen, you guys, the road
to Shell City is really dangerous.

404
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,882
There's crooks, killers
and monsters everywhere.

405
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,887
And what's worse,
there's a giant Cyclops

406
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:51,391
who guards the outskirts of the city
and preys on innocent sea creatures.

407
00:25:51,595 --> 00:25:53,791
Don't let him catch you,
because if he does,

408
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,797
he'll take you back to his lair,
and you'll never be seen again.

409
00:25:57,002 --> 00:25:59,436
She's purty, SpongeBob.

410
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:00,900
Here, take this.

411
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:02,596
What's in here?

412
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:05,101
It's a magical bag of winds.

413
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:07,939
- I stole them from my father.
- You're hot.

414
00:26:08,147 --> 00:26:10,115
Once you find the crown,
open the bag of winds

415
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:11,647
and you'll be blown back home.

416
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:13,683
- Mindy!
- I'm coming.

417
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:17,084
- Good luck, SpongeBob.
- Wait. How did you know my name?

418
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,088
Oh, I'm gonna be
queen of the sea one day.

419
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:21,386
I've learned the names
of all the sea creatures.

420
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:23,119
What's my name?

421
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,424
That's easy. You're Patrick Star.

422
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,406
- Mindy!
- I gotta go. I believe in you guys.

423
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:34,803
Thanks, Mindy.

424
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:38,305
Don't worry, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick, Squidward and I...

425
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,947
Pass.

426
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:43,879
- Patrick and I...
- Hi.

427
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:47,750
...are gonna get that crown back
and save you from Neptune's wrath.

428
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:52,292
You've got nothing to worry about.
Your life is in our hands.

429
00:26:57,335 --> 00:27:00,361
Patrick, let's go get that crown.

430
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:18,916
- Feast your eyes, Patrick.
- What is it?

431
00:27:20,193 --> 00:27:22,093
The Patty Wagon.

432
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:24,827
Mr. Krabs uses it
for promotional reasons.

433
00:27:25,031 --> 00:27:26,761
Let me show you
some of its features.

434
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:29,663
Sesame-seed finish,
steel-belted pickles,

435
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,338
grilled-leather interior.
And under the hood,

436
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:36,841
a fuel-injected french-fryer
with dual overhead grease traps.

437
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:40,276
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

438
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,551
Hey, I thought you didn't have
a driver's license.

439
00:27:44,753 --> 00:27:47,621
You don't need a license
to drive a sandwich.

440
00:27:58,035 --> 00:28:02,563
- Shell City, here we come!
- Shell City, here we come!

441
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:07,477
Ding-a-ling.

442
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,512
Hey there, old buddy. Freeze.

443
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:15,548
One secret formula to go, please.

444
00:28:15,753 --> 00:28:19,155
No, no, don't trouble yourself.
I'll get it.

445
00:28:21,427 --> 00:28:25,659
Well, I'd like to hang around,
but I've got Krabby Patties to make...

446
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:28,396
...over at the Chum Bucket.

447
00:28:28,602 --> 00:28:32,902
Plan Z, I love you.

448
00:28:38,613 --> 00:28:43,573
<i>Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah
You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

449
00:28:43,784 --> 00:28:46,685
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

450
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,852
Fill her up, please.

451
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:57,832
What'll it be, fellas,
mustard or ketchup?

452
00:29:00,837 --> 00:29:02,304
Are they laughing at us?

453
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:05,133
No, Patrick,
they're laughing next to us.

454
00:29:06,843 --> 00:29:08,778
Where you two dumb kids
headed, anyway?

455
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:10,844
- Kids?
- Now, Patrick.

456
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:14,449
For your information,
we are not kids, we are men.

457
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:18,384
And we're off to get
King Neptune's crown in Shell City.

458
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,080
- Shell City?
- Shell City?

459
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:24,991
Ain't that the place that's guarded
by a killer Cyclops?

460
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,390
That's right.

461
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,534
Lloyd, take off your hat in respect.

462
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:31,430
Respect for the dead!

463
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:42,647
You two dipsticks ain't gonna last
ten seconds over the county line.

464
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:46,046
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.

465
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:50,886
Out of the car, fellas.

466
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:59,058
How many seconds was that?

467
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:01,327
Twelve.

468
00:30:01,537 --> 00:30:03,596
- In your face.
- In your face.

469
00:30:08,377 --> 00:30:11,438
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

470
00:30:11,648 --> 00:30:14,116
Who's the kid now?

471
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:16,945
They're dead.

472
00:30:21,892 --> 00:30:24,190
Perch Perkins here
with an incredible news flash.

473
00:30:24,395 --> 00:30:26,920
Plankton is selling Krabby Patties
at the Chum Bucket.

474
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:29,361
How is this possible? Let's find out.

475
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:32,560
Step right up. Plenty for everybody.

476
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:35,262
<i>Excuse me, Plankton.
Perch Perkins, Bikini Bottom News.</i>

477
00:30:35,474 --> 00:30:38,841
- Can I get a minute?
- Anything for you, Perch.

478
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:42,708
All of Bikini Bottom wants to know,
how did you get the Krabby Patty?

479
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:46,817
Well, Perch, before my dear friend
Eugene Krabs

480
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,183
was frozen by King Neptune...

481
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,052
I'm sorry.

482
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:55,325
He confided in me a secret wish.

483
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:59,989
"Sell the Krabby Patty in my absence
at the Chum Bucket," he said.

484
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,795
"Don't let the flame die out. "

485
00:31:06,608 --> 00:31:09,406
By the way, act now and you get
a free Chum Bucket bucket helmet

486
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:11,511
with every purchase.
Here you go, Perch.

487
00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:15,275
- Thanks.
- Bucket helmets for everyone!

488
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:19,511
My helmet!

489
00:31:22,826 --> 00:31:25,192
Karen, baby, I haven't felt this giddy

490
00:31:25,395 --> 00:31:27,955
since the day you agreed
to be my wife.

491
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:29,427
<i>I never agreed.</i>

492
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:32,432
Evil Plan Z is working perfectly.

493
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:34,605
Nothing can stop me now.

494
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:37,366
<i>Nothing except SpongeBob
and his pink friend.</i>

495
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:41,969
<i>My sensors indicate
that they're going after the crown.</i>

496
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,776
<i>If they make it back, Neptune might
discover some fingerprints.</i>

497
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:47,952
<i>Tiny fingerprints.</i>

498
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:51,683
<i>Stubby, tiny fingerprints.</i>

499
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,826
Evil Plan Z
is way ahead of you, baby.

500
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:58,225
I've already hired someone
to take care of those two.

501
00:31:58,431 --> 00:32:01,764
He's a vicious,
cold-blooded predator.

502
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:19,984
Sesame seed.

503
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,815
Hey, mister.

504
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,891
Does that hat take ten gallons?

505
00:32:45,183 --> 00:32:47,481
- Going on.
- Yeah. Yeah.

506
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:49,880
- Moving on.
- Just keep going.

507
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:51,282
Yup.

508
00:32:51,489 --> 00:32:53,286
Gonna get that crown.

509
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:57,794
Oh, yeah.

510
00:32:57,997 --> 00:32:59,396
- All right.
- All right.

511
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:02,328
Yeah. Victory.

512
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:06,495
- Are we there yet?
- We must be close by now.

513
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:08,907
Patrick, look. We're doing great!

514
00:33:10,744 --> 00:33:13,178
Shell City's only five days away.

515
00:33:14,648 --> 00:33:15,911
By car.

516
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:19,685
I wish we still had our car.

517
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:21,354
SpongeBob, look.

518
00:33:21,556 --> 00:33:23,046
Our car!

519
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:29,353
- The key.
- Where do you think it is?

520
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,547
There it is, Pat. The key!

521
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,487
Now, how are we gonna get it?

522
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:55,989
I know. Walk in and ask him for it.

523
00:33:56,193 --> 00:33:58,628
What are you looking at?

524
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:03,122
- Patrick, that's a terrible idea.
- Sorry.

525
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:06,965
I know. I'll go in and create
a distraction, and you get the key.

526
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,709
Wait. I wanna do the distraction.

527
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:15,279
Okay. I guess it really doesn't matter
who does the distraction.

528
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:18,180
You see me walking back...?

529
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:26,916
Can I have everybody's attention?

530
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:35,329
I have to use the bathroom.

531
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:39,573
It's right over there.

532
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:45,345
Stupid contacts. Oh, there it is.
I better go wash it off.

533
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:49,312
Patrick. You call that a distraction?

534
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,077
Well, I had to go to the bathroom.

535
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:53,788
Well, I got my hands dirty
for nothing.

536
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:57,319
Patrick, check it out.

537
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,625
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

538
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:02,696
- Bubble party!
- Bubble party!

539
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:20,779
Hey!

540
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:23,455
Who blew this bubble?

541
00:35:26,025 --> 00:35:27,856
You all know the rules!

542
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:31,327
All bubble-blowing babies
will be beaten senseless

543
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:35,298
by every able-bodied patron
in the bar.

544
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:38,630
That's right! So who blew it?

545
00:35:40,075 --> 00:35:43,272
So nobody knows.

546
00:35:43,478 --> 00:35:45,343
- Maybe it was...
- Shut up!

547
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:48,810
Somebody in here ain't a real man.

548
00:35:49,017 --> 00:35:51,384
You! We're on a baby hunt.

549
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:55,418
And don't think we don't know
how to weed them out.

550
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:58,353
Now, everybody line up.

551
00:35:58,961 --> 00:36:02,921
DJ, time for the test.

552
00:36:06,737 --> 00:36:10,367
No baby can resist
singing along to this.

553
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:14,140
SpongeBob, it's the
Goofy Goober theme song.

554
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:15,937
I know.

555
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:18,445
<i>Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

556
00:36:18,883 --> 00:36:21,182
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

557
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:25,824
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

558
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:30,996
- It was you! You're the baby!
- No, no! I only coughed, I swear.

559
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:35,557
DJ! Turn it up louder!

560
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,932
Don't sing along, Patrick.

561
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,904
I'm trying.

562
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:44,940
Trying so hard.

563
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:50,308
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

564
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:54,815
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

565
00:36:55,023 --> 00:36:59,119
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah</i>

566
00:37:00,128 --> 00:37:03,462
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah</i>

567
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:07,929
Well, well, well.

568
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:10,896
Which one of you babies was it?

569
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:12,598
- It was him.
- It was him.

570
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,902
- He did it.
- He did it.

571
00:37:14,111 --> 00:37:15,476
I've never even eaten at...

572
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:18,614
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah</i>

573
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:23,652
Well, looks like we got ourselves
a double baby.

574
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:29,856
Man, that was a close call.

575
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:31,756
Guess what I got.

576
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:33,932
The key!

577
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:48,771
Too bad SpongeBob's not here
to enjoy SpongeBob not being here.

578
00:37:58,259 --> 00:37:59,283
Morning.

579
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,490
Some people have no taste
in headgear.

580
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,135
Babies too?

581
00:38:09,404 --> 00:38:10,496
Excuse me, miss,

582
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:15,007
but where is everybody
getting that horrid headwear?

583
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,337
Who said that?

584
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:17,535
Down here.

585
00:38:17,747 --> 00:38:20,011
Well, I got it at the Chum Bucket.

586
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:22,707
Plankton's giving them away free
with every Krabby Patty.

587
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:26,287
Chum Bucket? Free? Krabby Patty?

588
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:30,221
Plankton? Giving? With?

589
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:37,157
So you're selling
Krabby Patties, Plankton?

590
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:39,997
That's right, Squidward.

591
00:38:40,438 --> 00:38:43,601
And there's a free bucket helmet
with every purchase.

592
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:44,935
Care for one?

593
00:38:45,144 --> 00:38:48,978
No. You may have hoodwinked
everyone else in this backwater town,

594
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:50,671
but you can't fool me.

595
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:53,351
I listen to public radio.

596
00:38:54,253 --> 00:38:57,815
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- It means you set up Mr. Krabs.

597
00:38:58,025 --> 00:39:00,323
You stole the crown
so Neptune would freeze him

598
00:39:00,527 --> 00:39:04,725
and you could finally get your stubby
little paws on the Krabby Patty formula.

599
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:07,128
It was you all along.

600
00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:10,202
But you made one fatal mistake.

601
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:12,566
You messed with my paycheck.

602
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:16,336
And I'm gonna report you
to the highest authority in the land,

603
00:39:16,545 --> 00:39:18,240
King Neptune!

604
00:39:18,447 --> 00:39:22,213
We'll see about that,
Inspector Looselips.

605
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:26,517
<i>Now activating helmet
brain- control devices.</i>

606
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,756
What?

607
00:39:44,642 --> 00:39:47,476
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

608
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,704
<i>- What's going on here?
- All hail Plankton.</i>

609
00:39:49,915 --> 00:39:52,076
Seize him, slaves!

610
00:39:52,284 --> 00:39:54,582
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

611
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:56,850
I'm getting out of here!

612
00:39:58,825 --> 00:40:01,692
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

613
00:40:02,195 --> 00:40:03,924
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

614
00:40:07,134 --> 00:40:09,261
Who can stop me now?

615
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:13,298
Who?

616
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,314
- Come on, Pat, one more time.
- Okay.

617
00:40:21,516 --> 00:40:27,786
We're on a baby hunt. And don't think
we don't know how to weed them out.

618
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:36,790
"Weed them out. "

619
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:39,001
What a jerk.

620
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,335
The road's getting kind of bumpy here.

621
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,406
You know, SpongeBob,

622
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,344
there's a lesson to be learned
from all of this.

623
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,847
What's that, Patrick?

624
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:57,886
A bubble-blowing double baby
doesn't belong out here

625
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,853
in man's country.

626
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:01,788
Yeah. Wait.

627
00:41:01,994 --> 00:41:03,518
We blew that bubble.

628
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:07,324
Doesn't that make us
a bubble-blowing double baby?

629
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:09,561
Hey, look, free ice cream!

630
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:13,734
Oh, boy!

631
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:21,907
How you doing?

632
00:41:23,117 --> 00:41:24,516
Wait a minute.

633
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,050
Wait a minute.

634
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:27,948
SpongeBob!

635
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:29,290
Yeah?

636
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,717
Make mine a chocolate!

637
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:33,958
Got you covered. Two, please.

638
00:41:34,229 --> 00:41:35,628
Certainly.

639
00:41:36,198 --> 00:41:37,825
You kids enjoy.

640
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:40,468
Actually, we're men,
lady, but thanks.

641
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,365
Okay, Patrick, let's...

642
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:45,735
You can let go now.
I said, let go, please.

643
00:41:48,277 --> 00:41:50,303
What is this?

644
00:41:55,486 --> 00:41:57,818
What kind of old lady are you?

645
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,014
Did you get the ice cream?

646
00:42:27,387 --> 00:42:29,150
Step on it, Patrick!

647
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:52,014
Hey!

648
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:55,280
You may not know it, cowboy,

649
00:42:55,485 --> 00:43:00,354
but we got a rule around here
about blowing bubbles.

650
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:05,788
All bubble-blowing babies
will be beaten senseless by every

651
00:43:05,996 --> 00:43:08,123
able-bodied...

652
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:11,160
- In bar...
- Bar...

653
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:28,845
Come on, kiddies,
have some ice cream.

654
00:43:30,957 --> 00:43:34,894
I'll let you pet Mr. Whiskers.

655
00:43:38,098 --> 00:43:40,089
Jump for it, Patrick!

656
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:06,457
Well, we lost our car again.

657
00:44:06,663 --> 00:44:09,598
Never mind the car,
where's the road?

658
00:44:09,799 --> 00:44:12,427
Road. Road. Road.

659
00:44:12,636 --> 00:44:14,935
Road. Road. Road.

660
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:17,266
Road. R... Sorry.

661
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,069
There's the road.

662
00:44:19,343 --> 00:44:20,901
On the other side of this...

663
00:44:21,979 --> 00:44:24,540
...deep, dark...

664
00:44:25,517 --> 00:44:27,246
...dangerous...

665
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,821
- Hazardous.
... hazardous...

666
00:44:32,024 --> 00:44:33,423
Monster-infested.

667
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,457
Yeah, monster-infested...

668
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:37,954
...trench.

669
00:44:38,164 --> 00:44:39,529
Hey, SpongeBob, look!

670
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:41,925
Here's the way down.

671
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,736
Well, we're not gonna get
the crown standing here.

672
00:44:48,943 --> 00:44:51,138
On to Shell City.

673
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:01,180
Hey, look, it's making noise.

674
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:02,356
SpongeBob?

675
00:45:04,826 --> 00:45:07,796
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm going home, Patrick.

676
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:09,726
But what about Mr. Krabs?

677
00:45:09,932 --> 00:45:11,160
What about us?

678
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:13,358
We'll never survive in that trench!

679
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:16,198
You said it yourself,
this is man's country.

680
00:45:16,406 --> 00:45:19,773
And let's face it, Pat. We're just...

681
00:45:19,977 --> 00:45:22,309
...kids.
- We're not kids.

682
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,412
Open your eyes, Patrick!

683
00:45:24,614 --> 00:45:27,049
We blow bubbles, we eat ice cream.

684
00:45:27,251 --> 00:45:30,482
We worship a dancing peanut,
for corn's sake!

685
00:45:30,688 --> 00:45:32,679
We don't belong out here!

686
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,757
We do not worship him.

687
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,055
You've been wearing the same Goofy
Goober Peanut Party underpants

688
00:45:39,264 --> 00:45:40,322
for three years straight.

689
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,361
What do you call that?

690
00:45:42,568 --> 00:45:43,933
Worship?

691
00:45:44,136 --> 00:45:47,629
You're right, SpongeBob.
We are kids.

692
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:56,573
Pull your pants up, Patrick.

693
00:45:56,783 --> 00:45:59,514
- We're going home.
- But you can't go home.

694
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:01,488
Mindy!

695
00:46:01,689 --> 00:46:03,213
Mindy?

696
00:46:05,326 --> 00:46:07,727
- How much did you hear?
- I heard enough.

697
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:10,489
- Did you see my underwear?
- No, Patrick.

698
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:11,791
Did you want to?

699
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,262
Look, guys, you may be kids,

700
00:46:13,468 --> 00:46:15,902
but you're the only ones left
who can get that crown.

701
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:17,868
What do you mean,
the only ones left?

702
00:46:18,074 --> 00:46:21,441
Things have gotten a lot worse
since you left Bikini Bottom.

703
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:25,546
Or should I say Planktopolis.

704
00:46:25,748 --> 00:46:27,944
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

705
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,514
No resting!

706
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,884
This monument celebrating my glory
isn't gonna build itself.

707
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,752
Move faster!

708
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,224
Oh, my gosh! Patrick, look!

709
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:41,365
Plankton's turned everyone
we know into slaves.

710
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,032
Squidward.

711
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:45,034
Sandy.

712
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,533
Mrs. Puff.

713
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:48,932
Even Gary.

714
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:51,203
Plankton.

715
00:46:51,544 --> 00:46:53,535
Can't your father do something?

716
00:46:53,913 --> 00:46:56,473
My father's too distracted
by his bald spot to do anything.

717
00:46:58,985 --> 00:47:01,579
Squire, will you hurry.

718
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,922
So you see, you can't quit.

719
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:08,594
The fate of Bikini Bottom
rests in your hands.

720
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:12,397
- But... But we're just...
- Hey. It doesn't matter if you're kids.

721
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,592
And what's so wrong with
being a kid, anyway? Kids rule!

722
00:47:15,803 --> 00:47:17,998
You don't need to be a man
to do this.

723
00:47:18,206 --> 00:47:20,505
You just gotta believe in yourself.

724
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:23,371
You just gotta believe!

725
00:47:24,646 --> 00:47:27,114
- I believe.
- That's the spirit.

726
00:47:27,316 --> 00:47:28,908
I believe that

727
00:47:29,118 --> 00:47:33,351
everybody I know is a goner!

728
00:47:34,624 --> 00:47:35,750
Come on, guys.

729
00:47:38,294 --> 00:47:40,320
Guys.

730
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,567
Guys?

731
00:48:02,253 --> 00:48:03,242
Guys?

732
00:48:07,091 --> 00:48:08,991
Oh, boy.

733
00:48:09,593 --> 00:48:11,528
Think, Mindy, think.

734
00:48:13,465 --> 00:48:15,365
Yup, I guess you're right.

735
00:48:17,235 --> 00:48:20,033
A couple of kids could never
survive this journey.

736
00:48:23,576 --> 00:48:27,171
That's why I guess I'll just
have to turn you into men.

737
00:48:28,814 --> 00:48:31,682
You can do that? How?

738
00:48:31,885 --> 00:48:34,547
With my mermaid magic.

739
00:48:36,924 --> 00:48:38,391
Did you hear that, Patrick?

740
00:48:38,592 --> 00:48:41,960
She'll use her mermaid magic
to turn us into men!

741
00:48:42,163 --> 00:48:43,562
Hooray!

742
00:48:43,765 --> 00:48:47,394
We're gonna be men! We're gonna
be men! We're gonna be men!

743
00:48:47,735 --> 00:48:49,362
Good. Now, let's get started.

744
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:50,765
Close your eyes.

745
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:53,498
- Are we men yet?
- Not yet.

746
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:54,971
Spin around three times.

747
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:56,808
I think it's working.

748
00:48:57,613 --> 00:49:00,605
Good. Now, keep your eyes shut.

749
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:02,975
With my mermaid's magic

750
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,718
and my one tailfin,

751
00:49:06,923 --> 00:49:10,381
I command the two of you
to turn into men!

752
00:49:10,927 --> 00:49:11,894
Open your eyes.

753
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:20,226
I don't feel any... Oh, my gosh,
Patrick, you have a mustache!

754
00:49:20,438 --> 00:49:21,405
So do you!

755
00:49:25,577 --> 00:49:29,138
So now that you're men,
can you make it to Shell City?

756
00:49:33,018 --> 00:49:34,486
- Guys.
- Yeah?

757
00:49:34,687 --> 00:49:38,248
I said, now that you're men,
can you make it to Shell City?

758
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:39,447
Heck, yeah!

759
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:42,457
- Are men afraid of anything?
- Heck, no!

760
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:43,652
And why?

761
00:49:43,864 --> 00:49:46,128
Because we're invincible!

762
00:49:46,367 --> 00:49:48,164
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

763
00:49:48,602 --> 00:49:50,763
I never said that.

764
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,038
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

765
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,206
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

766
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,275
Yeah! Yeah!

767
00:49:57,278 --> 00:49:59,542
Yeah! Yeah!

768
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:01,613
Yeah.

769
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,220
- Patrick?
- Yeah, buddy?

770
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:09,289
Why did we jump over the edge
instead of taking the stairs?

771
00:50:09,492 --> 00:50:11,187
Bec...

772
00:50:11,394 --> 00:50:13,123
Well...

773
00:50:25,643 --> 00:50:28,077
- Patrick.
- Are we dead?

774
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:30,577
No. Far from it, my friend.

775
00:50:30,782 --> 00:50:33,512
We're safe and sound
at the bottom of this trench.

776
00:50:40,926 --> 00:50:42,655
The mustaches worked!

777
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:44,692
Do you know what that means?

778
00:50:44,897 --> 00:50:47,765
We are invincible!

779
00:50:51,204 --> 00:50:54,298
<i>Now that we're men
We can do anything</i>

780
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:58,342
<i>Now that we're men
We are invincible</i>

781
00:50:58,546 --> 00:51:02,107
<i>Now that we're men
We'll go to Shell City</i>

782
00:51:02,316 --> 00:51:05,683
<i>Get the crown, save the town
And Mr. Krabs</i>

783
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,420
<i>Now that we're men</i>

784
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,680
<i>We have facial hair</i>

785
00:51:09,891 --> 00:51:11,381
<i>Now that we're men</i>

786
00:51:11,593 --> 00:51:13,424
<i>I change my underwear</i>

787
00:51:13,628 --> 00:51:17,065
<i>Now that we're men
We've got a manly flair</i>

788
00:51:17,266 --> 00:51:20,724
<i>We've got the stuff
We're tough enough to save the day</i>

789
00:51:21,237 --> 00:51:23,467
<i>We never had a chance
when we were kids</i>

790
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:25,363
<i>No! No! No!</i>

791
00:51:25,575 --> 00:51:27,476
<i>But take a look at what
the mermaid did</i>

792
00:51:40,158 --> 00:51:41,716
Yeah, go, Pat.

793
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,002
Oh, yeah.

794
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:01,604
Yeah, go, SpongeBob.

795
00:52:03,784 --> 00:52:05,445
Hooray!

796
00:52:05,652 --> 00:52:09,521
<i>Now that they're men
We can't bother them</i>

797
00:52:09,724 --> 00:52:13,251
<i>Now that they're men
They have become our friends</i>

798
00:52:13,461 --> 00:52:16,624
<i>Now that they're men
There'll be a happy end</i>

799
00:52:16,831 --> 00:52:20,165
<i>They'll pass the test
And finish the quest for the crown</i>

800
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:22,166
<i>They'll pass the test</i>

801
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:24,066
<i>And finish the quest</i>

802
00:52:24,273 --> 00:52:29,177
<i>They'll pass the test
And finish the quest for the crown</i>

803
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,313
"Shell City, dead ahead. "

804
00:52:31,514 --> 00:52:32,674
We did it, Pat!

805
00:52:32,882 --> 00:52:34,247
We made it past everything!

806
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:37,544
Even the hideous,
disgusting monsters.

807
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:42,722
Not you guys.

808
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:44,326
You guys are awesome!

809
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:47,929
Well, Patrick, we should be there
in one more verse.

810
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:50,101
<i>- Now that we're men...
- Finally.</i>

811
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,397
I got you right where I want you.

812
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:57,732
Can I help you with something, sir?

813
00:52:58,076 --> 00:52:59,635
Name's Dennis.

814
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:02,337
I've been hired to exterminate you.

815
00:53:02,782 --> 00:53:06,513
You're gonna exterminate us?

816
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:25,706
Listen, junior,

817
00:53:25,907 --> 00:53:28,740
you caught me and my friend here
in a good mood today,

818
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:31,003
so I'm gonna let you off
with a warning.

819
00:53:31,213 --> 00:53:32,942
Step aside,
and you won't have to feel

820
00:53:33,148 --> 00:53:35,673
the awesome wrath
of our mustaches.

821
00:53:36,185 --> 00:53:38,449
You mean these?

822
00:53:41,224 --> 00:53:45,991
I thought you still had a piece of salad
stuck to your lip from lunchtime.

823
00:53:51,636 --> 00:53:53,228
They were fake?

824
00:53:53,437 --> 00:53:55,064
Of course they were fake!

825
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,731
This is what a real mustache
looks like.

826
00:54:02,381 --> 00:54:05,976
- Is he a mermaid?
- All right. Enough gab.

827
00:54:08,854 --> 00:54:10,913
What are you gonna do to us?

828
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:13,319
Plankton was very specific.

829
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:14,627
Plankton?

830
00:54:14,827 --> 00:54:17,489
For some reason,
he wanted me to step on you.

831
00:54:17,697 --> 00:54:19,289
Step on us?

832
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:23,960
Yeah! That way you'll never find out
that he stole the crown!

833
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,764
Perhaps I've said too much.

834
00:54:35,684 --> 00:54:37,311
That's a big boot.

835
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:38,486
Don't worry.

836
00:54:38,687 --> 00:54:41,121
This will only hurt a lot.

837
00:54:45,027 --> 00:54:47,052
I love this job!

838
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:51,229
- Bigger boot!
- Wait, Pat.

839
00:54:51,434 --> 00:54:53,562
This bigger boot saved our lives.

840
00:54:55,472 --> 00:54:57,337
Thank you, stranger.

841
00:55:03,414 --> 00:55:05,109
Stranger?

842
00:55:06,384 --> 00:55:08,147
It's the Cyclops!

843
00:55:32,345 --> 00:55:34,507
Help us! Help us!

844
00:55:36,884 --> 00:55:38,909
Save us, someone!

845
00:56:04,748 --> 00:56:06,181
Are we dead?

846
00:56:06,383 --> 00:56:07,850
I don't think so.

847
00:56:08,986 --> 00:56:11,887
Artificially colored rocks?

848
00:56:14,425 --> 00:56:16,690
I don't know where we are.

849
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,522
What is this?

850
00:56:19,197 --> 00:56:22,189
It's some kind of wall
of psychic energy.

851
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,337
No, Pat, it's a giant glass bowl.

852
00:56:26,539 --> 00:56:28,370
Hey, there's some fish folk.

853
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,199
- Hey, over here!
- Hey! Hey! Hey, you guys!

854
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:35,005
- You guys, hey! Help!
- Hey! Help!

855
00:56:35,215 --> 00:56:38,616
- A little help here! We're stuck in this...
- Help us out of the tank!

856
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:40,618
Wait a second.

857
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:48,327
Those fish are dead.

858
00:57:08,852 --> 00:57:10,410
What's he gonna do with us?

859
00:57:16,393 --> 00:57:20,523
Oh, no, he's going for his
evil instruments of torture.

860
00:57:26,972 --> 00:57:29,167
Glue? Google eyes?

861
00:57:39,986 --> 00:57:43,888
He's making
a humorous diorama of...

862
00:57:45,091 --> 00:57:48,118
...Alexander Clam Bell?

863
00:57:48,328 --> 00:57:52,526
Patrick, he's killing sea animals and
making them into smelly knickknacks.

864
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:54,564
And I think we're next.

865
00:57:54,868 --> 00:57:59,135
- You think so?
- Patrick! No!

866
00:58:10,853 --> 00:58:18,055
The heat is so intense
from this lamp that I can't move.

867
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:19,751
Tell me about it.

868
00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:33,941
This doesn't look too good, Patrick.

869
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:35,578
You mean we're not gonna

870
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:40,218
<i>Get the crown, save the town
And Mr. Krabs?</i>

871
00:58:40,452 --> 00:58:45,014
I don't even think we're gonna
be able to save ourselves, buddy.

872
00:58:49,162 --> 00:58:51,756
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

873
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:56,993
Well, it looks like what everybody
said about us is true, Patrick.

874
00:58:57,237 --> 00:58:59,102
You mean that we're attractive?

875
00:58:59,306 --> 00:59:02,275
No, that we're just kids.

876
00:59:02,476 --> 00:59:06,173
A couple of kids
in way over their heads.

877
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,871
We were doomed from the start.

878
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,711
I mean, look at us.

879
00:59:10,919 --> 00:59:13,581
We didn't even come
close to the crown.

880
00:59:13,788 --> 00:59:15,949
We let everybody down.

881
00:59:16,157 --> 00:59:17,920
We failed.

882
00:59:18,126 --> 00:59:19,684
Shell City.

883
00:59:19,895 --> 00:59:22,921
Yeah, we never made it to Shell City.

884
00:59:23,132 --> 00:59:24,793
Shell City.

885
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:26,195
Exactly, buddy.

886
00:59:26,402 --> 00:59:29,530
Yeah, the place we never got to.

887
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:30,866
Shell City.

888
00:59:31,074 --> 00:59:33,304
Okay, now you're starting
to bum me out, Patrick.

889
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:35,944
No, look at the sign.

890
00:59:36,346 --> 00:59:41,148
"Shell City.
Marine gifts and sundries. "

891
00:59:41,352 --> 00:59:44,480
Shell City is a gift shop?

892
00:59:44,689 --> 00:59:49,388
But if this is Shell City,
then where's the...?

893
00:59:51,096 --> 00:59:52,529
- Crown.
- Crown.

894
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:56,062
Neptune's crown.

895
00:59:56,268 --> 00:59:59,362
This is Shell City.

896
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:02,666
Pat, we did make it.

897
01:00:03,209 --> 01:00:06,474
Yeah, I guess we did.

898
01:00:08,615 --> 01:00:12,609
We did all right
for a couple of goofballs.

899
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:28,062
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

900
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:34,301
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

901
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:41,715
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah</i>

902
01:00:41,918 --> 01:00:49,257
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

903
01:01:05,378 --> 01:01:09,439
That's the end of SpongeBob.

904
01:01:09,648 --> 01:01:11,275
Come here, you.

905
01:01:14,054 --> 01:01:15,817
Shut up and look at the screen.

906
01:01:17,391 --> 01:01:19,450
The bird's right. Look.

907
01:01:19,659 --> 01:01:23,060
It be the tear of the Goofy Goobers.

908
01:01:55,499 --> 01:01:57,558
Hey, we're alive.

909
01:02:03,741 --> 01:02:06,472
- Let's get that crown.
- Right.

910
01:02:07,946 --> 01:02:11,473
On three, Patrick. Ready?
One, two, three.

911
01:02:11,683 --> 01:02:13,947
Hey, it's lighter than I thought.

912
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:32,900
What's happening?

913
01:02:33,106 --> 01:02:35,974
I don't know. Look!

914
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,421
Come on, Patrick.

915
01:03:23,629 --> 01:03:27,293
Let's get this crown
back to Bikini Bottom.

916
01:03:28,701 --> 01:03:31,829
- Do you still have that bag of winds?
- I sure do.

917
01:03:35,241 --> 01:03:36,936
Here you go.

918
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:39,603
What?

919
01:03:39,813 --> 01:03:41,144
Nothing. Nothing.

920
01:03:41,348 --> 01:03:42,975
Okay, let's go over the instructions.

921
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:47,413
Let's see, it says here, "Step one:
Point bag away from home. "

922
01:03:47,622 --> 01:03:51,023
- Okay.
- "Step two: Plant feet firmly on ground. "

923
01:03:51,226 --> 01:03:52,955
- Right.
- "Step three:

924
01:03:53,161 --> 01:03:55,629
Remove string from bag,
releasing the winds. "

925
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:57,822
Check.

926
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,934
Well, that seems simple enough.

927
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,263
Point bag away from home,
feet firmly on ground,

928
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:04,063
pull string, releasing the winds.

929
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:06,434
All right, let's do it for real.

930
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:09,203
SpongeBob?

931
01:04:11,782 --> 01:04:13,807
- No, no, stop!
- I was bad, I'm sorry!

932
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,917
- Please, bag.
- I'm sorry, I just thought...

933
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:18,280
It was a mistake!

934
01:04:24,095 --> 01:04:28,623
Oh, no. How will we ever get
back to Bikini Bottom now?

935
01:04:28,834 --> 01:04:30,165
I can take you there.

936
01:04:39,346 --> 01:04:42,315
- Who are you?
- I'm David Hasselhoff.

937
01:04:42,515 --> 01:04:44,107
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

938
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:47,247
So where's your boat?

939
01:04:47,621 --> 01:04:49,283
Boat?

940
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:57,653
- Go, Hasselhoff.
- Next stop, Bikini Bottom.

941
01:04:59,033 --> 01:05:03,368
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

942
01:05:03,572 --> 01:05:07,372
Well, Krabs,
you know what today is?

943
01:05:07,576 --> 01:05:09,271
Sorry about this, calendar.

944
01:05:09,478 --> 01:05:11,140
March 14.

945
01:05:11,347 --> 01:05:13,008
Wait, that's not right.

946
01:05:13,216 --> 01:05:17,550
It should say
"The day that Krabs fries. "

947
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,728
Guess who's here.

948
01:05:37,776 --> 01:05:42,237
Hooray for Hasselhoff!
Nothing can stop us now.

949
01:05:42,448 --> 01:05:46,384
Unidentified object
off the hindquarters.

950
01:05:47,887 --> 01:05:49,878
It looks like...

951
01:05:50,589 --> 01:05:52,057
...bigger boot.

952
01:05:52,259 --> 01:05:54,250
But how?

953
01:06:03,504 --> 01:06:04,562
Dennis!

954
01:06:04,772 --> 01:06:06,262
Did you miss me?

955
01:06:11,279 --> 01:06:13,805
This is the best seat in the house.

956
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:18,214
All right, Neptune, let's get it on.

957
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:22,152
Eugene Krabs,
your six-day reprieve is up,

958
01:06:22,358 --> 01:06:25,850
and it is time for you to die.

959
01:06:26,062 --> 01:06:29,293
Please, I didn't do it.

960
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:32,195
There is nothing else I can do.

961
01:06:32,403 --> 01:06:34,769
You can give SpongeBob and Patrick
a little more time.

962
01:06:34,972 --> 01:06:39,671
Except give SpongeBob and Patrick
a little more time...

963
01:06:39,877 --> 01:06:42,345
What? Mindy, will you butt out.

964
01:06:42,547 --> 01:06:45,243
I won't have you stalling
this execution.

965
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:48,146
Stalling? I'm not stalling anything.

966
01:06:48,353 --> 01:06:50,184
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

967
01:06:50,388 --> 01:06:53,654
Yes, you are.
You're doing it right now.

968
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:56,852
- I'm stalling.
- Yes.

969
01:06:57,063 --> 01:06:58,758
- Stalling?
- Stalling!

970
01:06:59,132 --> 01:07:01,760
- Stalling.
- Stalling!

971
01:07:01,968 --> 01:07:03,060
Oh, boy.

972
01:07:06,874 --> 01:07:09,001
Now, where were we?

973
01:07:09,209 --> 01:07:11,439
- Patrick, run.
- No.

974
01:07:11,645 --> 01:07:13,112
I'm tired of running.

975
01:07:13,313 --> 01:07:17,182
If we run now, we'll never stop...

976
01:07:17,886 --> 01:07:20,013
Run, SpongeBob!

977
01:07:26,562 --> 01:07:29,030
Take it easy back there, fellas.

978
01:07:37,073 --> 01:07:38,836
SpongeBob, be careful.

979
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:41,169
Come on, kid, give it up.

980
01:07:42,078 --> 01:07:43,841
Dennis always gets his man.

981
01:07:44,282 --> 01:07:45,772
Never!

982
01:07:53,958 --> 01:07:55,722
Yeah! I did it!

983
01:07:55,928 --> 01:07:57,691
You got guts, kid.

984
01:07:57,896 --> 01:07:59,625
Too bad I gotta rip them out of you.

985
01:07:59,832 --> 01:08:01,800
I don't know what Plankton's
paying you,

986
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,662
but if you let us go,
I can make it worth your while.

987
01:08:04,871 --> 01:08:07,237
It's gonna take a lot more than 5...

988
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,001
- What is this?
- That, sir, is five Goober dollars.

989
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:14,374
Legal tender at any participating
Goofy Goober...

990
01:08:14,581 --> 01:08:17,142
I got bubbles. Fun at parties.

991
01:08:17,785 --> 01:08:19,650
My eyes.

992
01:08:19,854 --> 01:08:21,754
I got you, SpongeBob.

993
01:08:21,956 --> 01:08:23,924
Thanks, buddy.

994
01:08:24,124 --> 01:08:25,250
Thanks a lot.

995
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,018
That's it.

996
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:28,890
I'm through messing around.

997
01:08:29,097 --> 01:08:31,725
See you later, fools.

998
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:40,403
See you.

999
01:08:41,244 --> 01:08:43,678
So you think...

1000
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,042
...I'm...

1001
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,548
...stalling.

1002
01:08:48,752 --> 01:08:50,720
Where am I, in Crazytown?

1003
01:08:50,921 --> 01:08:55,187
I have had enough of this nonsense!

1004
01:08:55,392 --> 01:09:00,831
You are to wait in the carriage
until the execution is done.

1005
01:09:02,133 --> 01:09:04,693
- But, Daddy...
- Now!

1006
01:09:07,973 --> 01:09:09,406
No, no, no!

1007
01:09:09,608 --> 01:09:12,441
Oh, SpongeBob, wherever you are,
you better hurry.

1008
01:09:15,014 --> 01:09:19,213
Okay, fellas, this is where you get off.
Bikini Bottom's directly below.

1009
01:09:19,419 --> 01:09:21,819
But we'll never be able
to float down in time.

1010
01:09:22,022 --> 01:09:24,718
Who said anything about floating?

1011
01:09:25,392 --> 01:09:28,794
<i>- Initiating launch sequence.
- What the...?</i>

1012
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:34,066
- Did you see that?
- The control.

1013
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:37,902
All hands on deck.

1014
01:09:38,907 --> 01:09:42,638
<i>Ten seconds to liftoff. Nine, eight...</i>

1015
01:09:42,844 --> 01:09:46,974
Eugene Krabs, the time has come...

1016
01:09:47,182 --> 01:09:48,844
- No.
- Yes.

1017
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:50,781
<i>...six, five...</i>

1018
01:09:50,987 --> 01:09:51,954
...for you...

1019
01:09:52,155 --> 01:09:53,782
- No.
- Yes.

1020
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:55,582
<i>...three, two...</i>

1021
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:57,419
...to fry.
- No.

1022
01:09:57,627 --> 01:09:59,960
<i>- Yes.
- ... one.</i>

1023
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:06,026
No!

1024
01:10:08,907 --> 01:10:11,637
You done good, Hasselhoff.
You done...

1025
01:10:17,048 --> 01:10:19,210
Hooray! We made it.

1026
01:10:19,418 --> 01:10:21,886
We made it.

1027
01:10:26,659 --> 01:10:29,026
My crown.

1028
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:33,097
My beautiful crown!

1029
01:10:34,768 --> 01:10:38,966
SpongeBob? Patrick?
I knew you could do it.

1030
01:10:47,648 --> 01:10:52,018
Oh, yes. Well done, SpongeBoob.

1031
01:10:52,554 --> 01:10:55,387
Sorry to rain
on your parade, Plankton.

1032
01:10:55,591 --> 01:10:57,923
Oh, don't worry about me.

1033
01:10:58,127 --> 01:11:03,828
My parade shall be quite dry
under my umbrella!

1034
01:11:04,034 --> 01:11:06,468
Umbrella?

1035
01:11:11,876 --> 01:11:13,002
Daddy, no.

1036
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:15,576
Daddy, yes.

1037
01:11:19,683 --> 01:11:22,619
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

1038
01:11:24,356 --> 01:11:29,453
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

1039
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:36,226
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

1040
01:11:37,403 --> 01:11:39,064
SpongeBob, what happened?

1041
01:11:39,272 --> 01:11:41,332
- Plankton cheated.
- Cheated?

1042
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:43,806
Hold on there, baldy.

1043
01:11:44,011 --> 01:11:45,137
Oh, grow up.

1044
01:11:45,345 --> 01:11:48,542
What, you think this is a game
of kickball on the playground?

1045
01:11:48,749 --> 01:11:51,913
You never had a chance
to defeat me, fool.

1046
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,587
And you know why?

1047
01:11:53,788 --> 01:11:55,278
Because you cheated?

1048
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:59,324
No, not because I cheated.
Because I'm an evil genius.

1049
01:11:59,527 --> 01:12:01,620
And you're just a kid.

1050
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:04,764
A stupid kid.

1051
01:12:09,572 --> 01:12:13,065
I guess you're right, Plankton.
I am just a kid.

1052
01:12:13,276 --> 01:12:15,836
Of course I'm right.
Okay, Neptune, time to kill.

1053
01:12:16,046 --> 01:12:19,106
And you know, I've been through
a lot in the past six days,

1054
01:12:19,316 --> 01:12:21,910
five minutes,
27-and-a-half seconds.

1055
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:24,850
And if I've learned anything
during that time,

1056
01:12:25,056 --> 01:12:27,320
it's that you are who you are.

1057
01:12:27,525 --> 01:12:32,862
- That's right. Okay, Neptune...
- And no amount of mermaid magic...

1058
01:12:33,065 --> 01:12:36,660
...or managerial promotion...

1059
01:12:36,869 --> 01:12:38,666
...or some other third thing...

1060
01:12:38,871 --> 01:12:42,363
...can make me anything more
than what I really am inside:

1061
01:12:42,741 --> 01:12:44,505
- A kid.
- That's great.

1062
01:12:44,711 --> 01:12:47,009
- Now, get back against the wall.
- But that's okay.

1063
01:12:47,213 --> 01:12:48,976
- What? What's going on?
- Because I did

1064
01:12:49,182 --> 01:12:51,241
what everyone said
a kid couldn't do.

1065
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:54,853
I made it to Shell City,
and I beat the Cyclops,

1066
01:12:55,055 --> 01:12:59,253
and I rode the Hasselhoff,
and I brought the crown back.

1067
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:02,327
- All right, we get the point.
- So, yeah, I'm a kid.

1068
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:04,965
And I'm also a goofball.
And a wing nut.

1069
01:13:05,167 --> 01:13:07,294
And a Knucklehead McSpazatron!

1070
01:13:08,236 --> 01:13:10,727
- What's going on here?
- But most of all, I'm...

1071
01:13:10,939 --> 01:13:13,669
- Okay, settle down. Take it easy.
- I'm... I'm...

1072
01:13:13,876 --> 01:13:15,036
What the scallop?!

1073
01:13:15,244 --> 01:13:16,541
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober</i>

1074
01:13:19,749 --> 01:13:21,307
<i>You're a Goofy Goober</i>

1075
01:13:23,586 --> 01:13:26,488
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers</i>

1076
01:13:28,559 --> 01:13:31,926
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goober</i>

1077
01:13:34,365 --> 01:13:37,061
<i>Put your toys away
Well, all I gotta say</i>

1078
01:13:37,268 --> 01:13:39,065
<i>When you tell me not to play
I say no way</i>

1079
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:42,103
<i>- No way!
- No, no freaking way</i>

1080
01:13:43,441 --> 01:13:46,036
<i>I'm a kid, you say
When you say I'm a kid</i>

1081
01:13:46,245 --> 01:13:48,110
<i>I say, "Say it again"
And then I say thanks</i>

1082
01:13:48,314 --> 01:13:50,874
<i>- Thanks!
- Thank you very much</i>

1083
01:13:52,785 --> 01:13:56,449
<i>So if you're thinking
That you'd like to be like me</i>

1084
01:13:56,656 --> 01:14:00,285
<i>Go ahead and try
The kid inside will set you free</i>

1085
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:06,298
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober</i>

1086
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,030
What's happening?

1087
01:14:13,641 --> 01:14:17,806
His dance moves are impressive,
but I'm in control.

1088
01:14:18,013 --> 01:14:21,710
<i>- Seize him!
- All hail Plankton.</i>

1089
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:51,579
I'm free. I've been freed!

1090
01:14:51,783 --> 01:14:53,375
What?

1091
01:14:54,352 --> 01:14:55,683
No!

1092
01:15:08,035 --> 01:15:09,662
My precious helmets!

1093
01:15:20,815 --> 01:15:22,942
His chops are too righteous.

1094
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:27,019
The helmets can't handle
this level of rock 'n' roll.

1095
01:15:27,221 --> 01:15:29,690
Karen, do something.

1096
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:31,617
Karen?

1097
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:37,230
All right, that's the last straw.

1098
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:40,835
Neptune, I command you to...

1099
01:15:41,905 --> 01:15:45,204
- Here you go, Daddy.
- I better get out of here.

1100
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:48,576
Look, it's the wizard who saved us.

1101
01:15:48,779 --> 01:15:50,838
Out of my way, fools.

1102
01:16:03,028 --> 01:16:05,997
Come on, I was just kidding.

1103
01:16:06,798 --> 01:16:10,360
Come on, you guys knew that,
didn't you?

1104
01:16:12,038 --> 01:16:13,767
With the helmets
and the big monuments...

1105
01:16:14,107 --> 01:16:16,541
Wasn't that hilarious, everybody?

1106
01:16:16,743 --> 01:16:19,372
I will destroy all of you!

1107
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:23,207
Well, Mindy, I have to admit,
you were right.

1108
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:25,408
Your compassion
for these sea creatures

1109
01:16:25,619 --> 01:16:27,416
proved a most admirable trait.

1110
01:16:27,621 --> 01:16:32,286
Without it, I would have never
again seen my beloved crown.

1111
01:16:32,494 --> 01:16:36,191
I think you're going to make a fine
ruler of the sea one day.

1112
01:16:36,398 --> 01:16:38,366
- Now, let's go home.
- Daddy,

1113
01:16:38,566 --> 01:16:40,194
haven't you forgotten something?

1114
01:16:40,403 --> 01:16:42,769
What? Oh, yeah.

1115
01:16:43,372 --> 01:16:47,741
Eugene Krabs,
I forgot to unfreeze you.

1116
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,970
What the...?

1117
01:16:53,116 --> 01:16:55,141
I guess I had it set to
"real boy" ending.

1118
01:16:59,623 --> 01:17:03,390
Oh, I'm sorry
for falsely freezing you, Krabs.

1119
01:17:03,594 --> 01:17:07,121
And may I say, sir,
you are a very lucky fellow

1120
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:10,357
to have in your employ
such a brave, faithful

1121
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:13,402
and heroic young lad.

1122
01:17:14,106 --> 01:17:17,075
- Where is he, anyway?
- I'm up here.

1123
01:17:21,748 --> 01:17:23,306
I'm on it.

1124
01:17:27,086 --> 01:17:29,646
Go to him now, Krabs.
Embrace him.

1125
01:17:30,323 --> 01:17:34,260
SpongeBob, me boy,
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

1126
01:17:34,462 --> 01:17:36,396
That's a mistake I won't make again.

1127
01:17:36,597 --> 01:17:39,760
Oh, Mr. Krabs, you old soft-serve.

1128
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,960
And now, SpongeBob,
I'm gonna do something

1129
01:17:43,171 --> 01:17:45,696
that I should've done six days ago.

1130
01:17:45,907 --> 01:17:49,104
Mr. Squidward,
front and center, please.

1131
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:54,181
I think we all know who rightfully
deserves to wear that manager pin.

1132
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:56,647
I couldn't agree more, sir.

1133
01:17:56,853 --> 01:17:59,378
Hooray for SpongeBob!

1134
01:18:02,893 --> 01:18:04,520
Wait a second, everybody.

1135
01:18:04,728 --> 01:18:06,821
There's something I need to say first.

1136
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:08,827
I just don't know how to put it.

1137
01:18:09,032 --> 01:18:11,296
I think I know what it is.

1138
01:18:11,502 --> 01:18:14,438
After going on
your life-changing journey,

1139
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:19,076
you now realize you don't want
what you thought you wanted.

1140
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:24,580
What you really wanted
was inside you all along.

1141
01:18:25,017 --> 01:18:28,475
Are you crazy? I was just gonna
tell you that your fly is down.

1142
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:32,849
Manager! This is
the greatest day of my life!

1143
01:26:30,916 --> 01:26:33,077
You know, David Hasselhoff
is a great artist.

1144
01:26:33,285 --> 01:26:34,582
Excuse me, sir.

1145
01:26:36,055 --> 01:26:37,318
You folks have to leave.

1146
01:26:38,758 --> 01:26:42,785
What? Say that again, if you dare.

1147
01:26:42,996 --> 01:26:45,191
You folks have to leave.

1148
01:26:46,934 --> 01:26:48,902
Okay.

1149
01:26:49,305 --> 01:27:49,310
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
