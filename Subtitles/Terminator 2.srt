Aagh! Get him off me!

Agh!

Agh! Pull it out!

"Bad To The Bone")

R-31 David, Sherman Code Six

John!

42
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,085
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

43
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,680
John!

44
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,232
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

45
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,728
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

46
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,439
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

47
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,446
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

48
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,369
- Todd!
- What?

49
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,824
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

50
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,956
Well, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

51
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,503
- Come on!
- John!

52
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,840
C'mon! Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

53
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,684
She's not my mother, Todd.

54
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,921
This next patient is interesting.

55
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,590
I've been following
the case for years.

56
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,793
A 29-year-old female,

57
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,761
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

58
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,012
The usual indicators:
depression, anxiety,

59
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,766
violent acting out,
delusions of persecution.

60
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,563
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

61
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,615
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator,

62
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,033
which looked human, of course,

63
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,828
was sent back through time
to kill her.

64
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,154
That's original.

65
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,082
And also,
that the father of her child

66
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,126
was a soldier
sent back to protect her.

67
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,625
- No?
- He was from the future too.

68
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,631
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

69
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,712
And here we are.

70
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,593
Morning, Sarah.

71
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,897
Good morning, Dr Silberman.
How's the knee?

72
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,684
Fine, Sarah.

73
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:41,070
She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.

74
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,242
Repeated escape attempts...

75
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,672
Let's move on, shall we?

76
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:56,714
Lewis.

77
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,508
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

78
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,804
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

79
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,435
Time to take you meds, Connor.

80
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,987
You take it.

81
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,359
You gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

82
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,360
I'm not taking it.

83
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,822
- I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble...

84
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,170
Yeah, zap her.

85
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,553
Last call, sugar.

86
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,190
Sweet dreams.

87
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,506
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

88
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,676
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

89
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,229
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

90
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,148
He took off on his bike this morning
so he could be anywhere.

91
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,853
- Do you have a photograph of John?
- Yeah. Hold on.

92
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,158
You gonna tell me what this is about?

93
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,235
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

94
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,700
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

95
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,161
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him, too.

96
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,087
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

97
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,211
Has that got something
to do with this?

98
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,471
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

99
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,391
Thanks for your cooperation.

100
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,137
Please insert
your stolen card now.

101
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,404
PIN number.

102
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,240
Hurry up.
This is taking too long.

103
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,818
Go, baby. Go, baby.

104
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,870
All right!

105
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,574
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

106
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,205
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

107
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,498
Withdraw three-zero-zero bucks.

108
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,425
Come on, baby. Come on! Come on!

109
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,720
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

110
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,469
All right. Easy money. Come on!

111
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,094
Yes! Piece of cake.

112
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,482
- Is that her?
- Yes.

113
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,736
- She's pretty cool, huh?
- No, she's a complete psycho.

114
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,570
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute, OK?

115
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,322
She tried to blow up
a computer factory,

116
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,827
but she got shot and arrested.

117
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,500
No shit.

118
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,624
She's a total loser.

119
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,422
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

120
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,817
Sarah.

121
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,870
Sarah, wake up.

122
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,083
Kyle?

123
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,291
You're dead.

124
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,381
Where's our son, Sarah?

125
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,555
They took him away from me.

126
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,009
- He's the target now.
- I know!

127
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,094
He's alone.
You have to protect him.

128
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,599
I know.

129
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,561
You tell me how I am supposed
to do that.

130
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,976
He doesn't even
believe me anymore.

131
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,319
I've lost him.

132
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,272
You're strong, Sarah.

133
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,824
- Stronger than you ever thought.
- No.

134
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,619
On your feet, soldier!

135
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,248
I love you. I always will.

136
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,712
- I need you.
- I'll always be with you.

137
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,840
Remember the message?

138
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,013
"The future is not set.

139
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,851
"There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves."

140
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,449
Stay with me.

141
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,080
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

142
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,552
KWQ, don't go!

143
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,017
Kyle!

144
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,926
It's like a giant strobe light,

145
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,511
burning right to my eyes.

146
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,151
Somehow I can still see.

147
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,874
We know
the dream's the same every night.

148
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,415
- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.

149
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,835
Children look like burnt paper.

150
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,054
Black.

151
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,632
Not moving.

152
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,394
And then the blast wave hits them.

153
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,777
And they fly apart like leaves.

154
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:07,910
Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world are very common.

155
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:14,003
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

156
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,958
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels very real to you.

157
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:23,262
On August 291997, it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you, too!

158
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,924
Anybody not wearing
two-million sunblock

159
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,635
is gonna have
a real bad day. Get it?

160
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,854
God! You think you're safe and alive.

161
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,228
You're already dead. Everybody!

162
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,855
Him. You. You're dead already.

163
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,813
This whole place,
everything you see is gone!

164
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,991
You're the one
living in a fucking dream, Silberman!

165
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:44,987
Cos I know it happened!

166
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,785
It happened!

167
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,003
I feel much better now.

168
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,960
Clearer.

169
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:08,516
Yes, your attitude has been
much improved lately.

170
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,069
It's helped me to have a goal,

171
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,322
something to look forward to.

172
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,569
What is that?

173
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:30,914
Well, you said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

174
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,662
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

175
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,961
and I could have visitors.

176
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,545
Well, it's been six months and...

177
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,587
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

178
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,297
I see.

179
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:56,564
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

180
00:25:56,764 --> 00:26:00,018
Now you think they don't exist?

181
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,444
They don't exist.

182
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,237
I know that now.

183
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,236
But you've told me
on many occasions

184
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,785
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

185
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,157
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

186
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,662
They would have found something
at the factory.

187
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,869
I see.

188
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:22,924
So, you don't believe any more
that the company covered it up?

189
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,553
No. Why would they?

190
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,715
Let's try a new position right there.

191
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:35,099
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

192
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,805
- Right.
- Those neurons are all centred.

193
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,682
Maybe
the inhibitor circuits failed...

194
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:41,983
Mr Dyson?

195
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,859
Mr Dyson, the materials team
is running another...

196
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,569
- Mr Dyson.
- Yes?

197
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,618
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

198
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,663
You have to sign for the...
Er... it.

199
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,787
- You have to sign it out.
- OK. Come on. I'll get it.

200
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,623
Mr Dyson,

201
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,671
I know I haven't been here long, but
I was wondering if you could tell me,

202
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,044
- I mean, if you know...
- Know what?

203
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,798
Well, if you know
where "it" came from.

204
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,301
I asked them that very same question
once. You know what they told me?

205
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,677
"Don't ask."

206
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,482
- Good morning, Mr Dyson.
- How's it going?

207
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,771
Insert key.

208
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,946
Left on three, two, one, turn.

209
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,610
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

210
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,990
There you go.

211
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,274
So,
what do you think, Doctor?

212
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,102
I have shown improvement, haven't I?

213
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,527
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

214
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,068
I know how smart you are.

215
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,786
I think you're just telling me
what I want to hear.

216
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,624
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

217
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,626
I think if I put you
in minimum security,

218
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,828
you'll just try to escape again.

219
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,511
You have to let me see my son.

220
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,964
Please.

221
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,762
Please.

222
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,931
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

223
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,890
If I could just make a phone call...

224
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,022
Afraid not. Not for a while.

225
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,239
I don't see any choice
but to recommend to the review board

226
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,737
that you stay here
for another six months.

227
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,822
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

228
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,661
- Get her off of me!
- You son of a bitch!

229
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,122
10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!

230
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,418
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

231
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,798
You don't know what you're doing!

232
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,267
Model citizen.

233
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,229
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

234
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,023
He said he was going to the galleria?

235
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,270
Yeah.

236
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,101
The galleria?

237
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,525
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

238
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,209
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

239
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,919
No.

240
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,968
- Hey, do you know this guy?
- Nah, I don't know him.

241
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,149
- John.
- Not now.

242
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,194
Hey, there's this cop
scoping for you. Check it out.

243
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,571
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

244
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,698
- Just go.
- Yeah.

245
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:49,950
I saw that kid...

246
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,284
Hey!

247
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,350
Hey! You're not supposed
to be in here!

248
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,074
Hey!

249
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,248
Get down.

250
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,196
Mister, are you all right?

251
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,090
Come on!

252
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,677
Goddamn!

253
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,627
Agh!

254
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:29,201
OK. Time out. Stop the bike.

255
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,332
Time out. Come on, stop the bike.

256
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,768
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

257
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,017
- But you are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

258
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:54,067
- Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
- No?

259
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,873
Holy shit! You're really real.

260
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,752
I mean...

261
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,793
You're like a machine underneath,
right? But sort of alive outside?

262
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,799
I'm a cybernetic organism:

263
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,552
living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

264
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,485
This is intense.

265
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,408
Get a grip, John. OK.

266
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,072
You're not here to kill me.

267
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,205
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

268
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,003
My mission is to protect you.

269
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,707
Yeah? Who sent you?

270
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,000
You did.

271
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,552
35 years from now,

272
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:06,131
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here, in this time.

273
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,092
Oh, this is deep.

274
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,542
This other guy,
he's a terminator like you, right?

275
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:38,212
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

276
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:44,340
- More advanced than you are?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

277
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,676
- What the hell does that mean?
- Liquid metal.

278
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,550
Where are we going?

279
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,510
We have to get out of the city
immediately

280
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,971
and avoid the authorities.

281
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,436
Listen, I got to stop by my house.
I want to pick up some stuff.

282
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,611
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

283
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,485
- You sure?
- I would.

284
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,835
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

285
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,506
...but I gotta warn them.

286
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,050
Shit! You got a quarter?

287
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,763
- Hello.
- 'Janelle, it's me.'

288
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,189
- John?
- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'

289
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,687
- Are you guys OK?
- 'Sure, honey, everything's OK.'

290
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,896
- Are you all right?
- 'Yeah, I'm fine.'

291
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,573
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

292
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:50,323
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

293
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,948
I'm making beef stew.

294
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,247
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

295
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,825
John, where are you?

296
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,786
What the hell is the goddamn dog
barking at?

297
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,123
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

298
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,674
The dog's really barking.

299
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,968
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that fucking mutt.

300
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,633
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

301
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,846
- Could he already be there?
- Honey, are you OK?

302
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,227
I'm right here. I'm fine.

303
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,933
'Are you sure you're all right?'

304
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,940
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

305
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,780
Janelle, what's wrong
with Wolfie?

306
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,449
I can hear him barking. Is he OK?

307
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,324
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

308
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:36,156
Where are you?

309
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,826
Your foster parents are dead.

310
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,823
No, no. I need a minute here.

311
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:23,207
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

312
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,755
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

313
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,753
Get real.

314
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:31,587
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

315
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,467
No, only an object of equal size.

316
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,094
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

317
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:40,020
It can't form complex machines.
Guns, explosives have chemicals,

318
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,392
moving parts.
It doesn't work that way.

319
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,190
But it can form solid metal shapes.

320
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,234
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

321
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,138
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

322
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,691
at the West Highland police station
in 1984.

323
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,108
He killed
17 police officers that night.

324
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,859
Men with families...

325
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,827
...children.

326
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:07,667
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda today.

327
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:12,960
Miss Connor,
we know you know who this guy is.

328
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:19,425
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing.

329
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,505
That the foster parents
have been murdered.

330
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,967
We know this guy's involved.

331
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:29,022
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

332
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:39,525
- We're wasting our time. Let's go.
- Sorry, guys.

333
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:42,235
She's grown more and more
disconnected from reality

334
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,945
as time goes on.

335
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,826
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

336
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,705
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

337
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,252
Sure.

338
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,205
Douglas,
take her back to her room, please.

339
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,505
Yes, sir.

340
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,214
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

341
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:04,390
You see, we spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

342
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:10,139
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy

343
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,555
running guns.

344
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,608
Then there were some other guys.

345
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,561
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from

346
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:19,989
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

347
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,780
Then she gets busted.

348
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:27,488
It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

349
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,747
It's like everything
I'd been brought up to believe

350
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,703
was all made-up bullshit.

351
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,334
I hated her for that.

352
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,295
But everything she said was true.

353
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,548
She knew.

354
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,802
And nobody believed her.

355
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,480
Not even me.

356
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,268
Listen,
we gotta get her out of there.

357
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,821
Negative. The T-1000's
highest probability for success now

358
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,238
will be to copy Sarah Connor

359
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,942
and wait for you
to make contact with her.

360
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,118
Great. What happens to her?

361
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,071
Typically, the subject
being copied is terminated.

362
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,250
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

363
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,578
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

364
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,787
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

365
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,508
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Damn it!

366
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,553
- Help! Help!
- This does not help our mission.

367
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,097
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

368
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,222
Help! I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

369
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:31,348
Let me go!

370
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,645
- Why the hell did you do that?
- Because you told me to.

371
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,153
What?

372
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,954
You have to do what I say, huh?

373
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,249
That's one of my mission parameters.

374
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:58,037
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

375
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,590
Yes!

376
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:07,387
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

377
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,600
- You OK, kid?
- Take a hike, bozo.

378
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,226
- Let's get outta here, man.
- Fuck you, you little dipshit!

379
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,649
Dipshit?

380
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,686
Put your leg down.

381
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:27,571
- Did you call moi dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

382
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,028
Grab this guy.
I can't believe he called me...

383
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,864
Agh! God! Get him off of me!

384
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:36,121
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douche bag?

385
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,542
Get off me!

386
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:44,875
No!

387
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,424
Put the gun down, now!

388
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:51,803
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

389
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,649
Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!

390
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,851
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

391
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,736
Listen to me very carefully, OK?

392
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,160
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

393
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,454
You got that?

394
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,998
You just can't go around
killing people.

395
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,074
Why?

396
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,206
What do you mean, why?
Cos you can't.

397
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,253
Why?

398
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,127
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

399
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,640
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

400
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:37,266
And I order you to help me.

401
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,204
Hm!

402
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,037
Hi!

403
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:08,291
- You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running late, aren't you?

404
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,748
They've been in there for an hour.

405
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,300
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

406
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,797
Oh, here come your friends now.

407
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,406
Well, that was productive.

408
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,863
- Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

409
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:25,614
How 'bout a beer?

410
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,245
Yeah, right!

411
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:54,776
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Lewis.

412
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,900
Must be my lucky day.

413
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,957
I think you're right
about number 24.

414
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,884
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

415
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:27,304
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

416
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,482
You!

417
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,614
You broke my arm.

418
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,412
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

419
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,161
That's one. Now, don't move.

420
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,836
What are you gonna do?

421
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,508
Why do we stop now?

422
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,559
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

423
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:16,228
- Right.
- Swear?

424
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:17,805
What?

425
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:21,017
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

426
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:26,064
- I swear I will not kill anyone.
- All right. Let's go.

427
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,991
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,
Monday through Friday.

428
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:45,041
- What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!

429
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,176
You crazy bastard!

430
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,717
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

431
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,014
He'll live.

432
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,863
Son of a bitch!

433
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,662
Let's try to remain calm.

434
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,664
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

435
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,791
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

436
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:26,123
Open the door.
It ain't gonna happen.

437
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,174
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

438
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,002
It won't work, Sarah.
You're no killer.

439
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,553
I don't believe you can do it.

440
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,005
You're already dead, Silberman.

441
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,635
Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

442
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,470
- So don't fuck with me!
- Open the door. Open the door.

443
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,985
Back off!

444
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,482
Get back!

445
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,485
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

446
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,904
Don't move!

447
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:58,205
- Drop the shit!
- Do it! Do it!

448
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,078
Get in the office.
On the floor, face down.

449
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:02,375
Not you!

450
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,078
Open the door.

451
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,333
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

452
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,060
Get her! Get her!

453
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:55,841
Sarah!

454
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,890
- Hurry up! Open the door!
- The door's locked!

455
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,851
Let's go! Open it!

456
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:02,848
Get the other door!

457
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,314
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

458
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,026
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

459
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,719
No!

460
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,267
No!

461
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,314
- No!
- Mom, wait!

462
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:48,811
Mom!

463
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,987
- Come back here!
- No! No!

464
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,700
No!

465
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,403
- Help her!
- Wait here.

466
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,113
Hurry UP!

467
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,289
He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!

468
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,582
Hold her.

469
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,832
He'll kill us all!

470
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,727
Mom, are you OK? Mom!

471
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,738
Come with me, if you want to live.

472
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,161
It's OK, Mom. He's here to help.
It's OK.

473
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,095
Go.

474
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,964
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

475
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,238
Get down.

476
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,548
No! Mom!

477
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:38,060
Out of the car!

478
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,649
Right now!

479
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,135
Go!

480
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:18,604
I'm out.

481
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,317
- Come on.
- Here.

482
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,951
Reload.

483
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,882
Last one!

484
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,633
Hang on.

485
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,244
Ready!

486
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,175
John!

487
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:34,885
Here, drive.

488
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:30,565
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

489
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,946
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

490
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:38,494
- Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.

491
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,127
Cool.

492
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:48,420
Come here.

493
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,174
I said I was OK.

494
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,103
John,
it was stupid of you to go there.

495
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,348
God damnit! You have to be
smarter than that.

496
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,024
You almost got yourself killed.

497
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,985
What were you thinking?

498
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,523
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

499
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,074
Do you understand?

500
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:17,450
You're too important.
Do you understand?

501
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,449
But...

502
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:26,879
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

503
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:30,466
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

504
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,301
What's wrong with your eyes?

505
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:42,812
Nothing.

506
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:55,112
So, what's your story?

507
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:06,749
You OK?

508
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,375
Fine.

509
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:13,384
Say, that's a nice bike.

510
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,526
Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

511
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:48,336
Listen,
do you know what you're doing?

512
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:51,380
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

513
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:57,303
I bet! Makes you
a more efficient killer, right?

514
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:58,550
Correct.

515
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,558
Does it hurt when you get shot?

516
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:11,442
I sense injuries. The data
could be called pain.

517
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,730
John, help me with the light.

518
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,948
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

519
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:21,616
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

520
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,323
How long do you live,
I mean "last", whatever?

521
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,243
120 years with
my existing power cell.

522
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,212
Can you learn stuff you
haven't been programmed with?

523
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:36,380
So you can be...
you know, more human?

524
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:38,803
Not such a dork all the time?

525
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:46,136
My CPU is a neural-net processor,
a learning computer,

526
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,389
hat Skynet presets to READ
only when we are sent out alone.

527
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,185
Doesn't want you
to do too much thinking.

528
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:55,774
No.

529
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,281
Can we reset the switch?

530
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:21,345
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

531
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:28,686
Do it.

532
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,147
Now open the port cover.

533
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:44,615
Pull to break the seal.

534
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:52,118
Good, now remove
the shock damping assembly.

535
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,958
You can now access the CPU.

536
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,843
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

537
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,588
Pull the CPU by its base tap.

538
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:06,344
Pull.

539
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:45,595
Can you see the pin switch?

540
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:47,424
No!

541
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,098
- Out of my way, John!
- Don't kill him!

542
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,893
"It", John, not "him".

543
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:58,063
Okay, "it". But we need "it".

544
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:00,486
Listen to me. Listen.

545
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,022
We're better off on our own.

546
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,780
He's the only proof of
the future, the war and that.

547
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,327
Maybe.

548
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,533
I don't trust it.

549
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,702
But he's my friend, alright?

550
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:19,171
You don't know what it's like
to kill these things.

551
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,504
If something goes wrong,
this could be our last chance.

552
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,302
If I'm supposed to
be this military leader,

553
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:28,552
maybe you start listening
to my ideas once in a while.

554
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,889
'Cause if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

555
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:54,039
Alright, play it your way.

556
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:03,541
Was there a problem?

557
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,126
No problem.

558
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,053
None whatsoever.

559
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,206
Are we learning yet?

560
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,188
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

561
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,943
Just head south.

562
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:14,954
Keep it under 65.

563
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:17,782
- We don't wanna be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

564
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:23,497
No, no, no. You gotta listen
to the way people talk.

565
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:27,129
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

566
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,506
<i>You say, "No problemo."</i>

567
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:33,510
And if someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"

568
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:37,844
And if you want to shine them on,
it's <i>"Hasta</i> la vista, baby."

569
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,471
<i>Hasta</i> la vista, baby.

570
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:43,232
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

571
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:46,231
And if someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

572
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:50,861
- Or you can do combinations.
- Chill out, dick-wad.

573
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,697
That's great. See? You're getting it.

574
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:55,824
<i>No problemo.</i>

575
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:09,383
- You got any cash?
- I got a couple of hundred bucks.

576
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:10,925
I'll give you half.

577
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:13,045
Mom!

578
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:15,802
Get some food.

579
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,265
No sense of humor.

580
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:27,940
And that's another thing:

581
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,771
lighten up a bit.

582
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:34,867
This severe routine is getting old.
You're acting like such a geek.

583
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:36,577
Smile once in a while.

584
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,162
Smile?

585
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,865
Yeah. You know, smile.

586
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,245
Watch.

587
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:47,042
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

588
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:49,423
Gimme a break.

589
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:53,427
Okay. Bad example.

590
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:57,265
See that guy over there?
That's a smile.

591
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:18,573
That's good.

592
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:21,948
You could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

593
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:30,665
Want some of my fries?

594
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:42,551
Do you need any help?

595
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,227
No.

596
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:46,146
- Got you!
- No, you didn't!

597
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:47,815
- Got you!
- No, you didn't!

598
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:56,862
We're not gonna make it, are we?

599
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:00,778
People, I mean.

600
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:05,783
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

601
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:09,579
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

602
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,666
Break it up
before I wring both of your necks.

603
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:19,138
I need to know how Skynet gets built,
who's responsible.

604
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:22,808
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

605
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:24,843
Who is that?

606
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:28,181
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

607
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,102
Why him?

608
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,563
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type

609
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,023
of microprocessor.

610
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:41,027
- Go on. Then what?
- In three years,

611
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:43,203
Cyberdyne will become the largest
supplier

612
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:44,656
of military computer systems.

613
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:48,455
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,

614
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:50,002
becoming fully unmanned.

615
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,331
Afterwards, they fly
with a perfect operational record.

616
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,917
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

617
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:59,425
The system goes on-line
on August 41997.

618
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,552
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defence.

619
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:05,475
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

620
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:09,852
It becomes self-aware at 02:14am
Eastern time, August 29.

621
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,359
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

622
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,904
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

623
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,607
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

624
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,864
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

625
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:25,321
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

626
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,327
will eliminate its enemies over here.

627
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,033
Jesus!

628
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:33,625
How much do you know about Dyson?

629
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:38,088
I have detailed files.

630
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,136
Want to know everything.

631
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:46,134
What he looks like.
Where he lives. Everything.

632
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,272
Miles!

633
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,714
- You going to work all day?
- I'm sorry, baby.

634
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,924
This thing
is kicking my ass.

635
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:31,138
It's Sunday. You promised to take
the kids to Raging Waters today.

636
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:36,275
I can't. I'm on a roll.

637
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:53,368
This is gonna blow 'em away.
It's a neural-net processor.

638
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:55,085
I know. You told me.

639
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:58,080
It thinks and learns like we do.

640
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:00,962
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

641
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:05,179
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

642
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,137
Why is that so important?

643
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:11,852
I need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like

644
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:14,430
I'm going crazy here.

645
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:17,896
Baby, I am this close.

646
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:19,981
Come here.

647
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:26,158
Imagine a jet airliner
with a pilot that never gets tired,

648
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,574
never makes mistakes,
never shows up with a hangover.

649
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:33,915
Meet the pilot.

650
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:38,667
Why did we get married?
Have children? You don't need us.

651
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:42,587
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

652
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:45,089
But it doesn't love you like we do.

653
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,933
I'm sorry. Really.

654
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:00,275
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

655
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:05,030
- Raging Waters?
- Yeah!

656
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,887
Wait in the car.

657
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,324
Enrique!

658
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:59,877
Are you here?

659
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,643
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

660
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:24,857
And you... are always like a snake.

661
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,981
It's great
to see you, Connor!

662
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:30,236
I told you I would be back.

663
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,159
I knew you would.
It's good to see you.

664
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,202
Jolanda!

665
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:37,623
Get out here, we got company.
And bring some tequila.

666
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:40,952
- Hey, big John. Como te va?
- What's up?

667
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,877
Who's this big guy?

668
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:48,050
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.

669
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,093
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

670
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,717
Uncle Bob, huh?

671
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:55,800
OK. OK!

672
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,267
How are you?

673
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:01,768
How are you?
You've grown so much.

674
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:03,474
Drink?

675
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,021
Uncle Bob?

676
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:14,110
Hey, Sarita! You're pretty
famous, all over the goddamn TV.

677
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,867
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

678
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,789
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

679
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:23,827
I just came for my stuff.

680
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:26,505
I need clothes,
food and one of your trucks.

681
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,673
How about the fillings
out of my fucking teeth?

682
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,377
Now, Enrique!

683
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:36,219
- You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on. Let's go.

684
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:59,533
One thing about my mom...

685
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:03,493
...she always plans ahead.

686
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,011
Excellent.

687
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:29,773
This is the best truck I got,
but the starter is gone.

688
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:32,820
- You got the time to change it out?
- Yeah.

689
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,944
I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

690
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:38,069
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.

691
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,988
- You get out tonight too, okay?
- Sure.

692
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:45,868
Just drop by any time
and totally fuck up my life.

693
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:54,209
See, I grew up in places like this,

694
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:57,217
so I thought
that's how people lived:

695
01:26:57,879 --> 01:27:01,133
riding around in helicopters,

696
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:03,769
learning how to blow shit up.

697
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:10,351
But then, when my mom got busted,
I got put in a regular school.

698
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:14,196
The other kids were into Nintendo.

699
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:30,500
Are you ever afraid?

700
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,043
No.

701
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:37,510
Not even of dying?

702
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:39,679
No.

703
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:48,601
You don't feel any emotion about it
one way or another?

704
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:51,475
No.
I have to stay functional

705
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:53,773
until the mission is complete.

706
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,324
Then it doesn't matter.

707
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:04,367
Yeah. I have to stay functional too.
I'm "too important".

708
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,597
That's definitely you.

709
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:36,979
Most of the guys my mom
hung round with were geeks.

710
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:40,862
But there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

711
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:44,240
- He taught me engines.
- Hold here.

712
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:47,618
Mom screwed it up, of course.

713
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:49,871
She'd always tell 'em about
Judgment Day

714
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:52,453
and me being this world leader.

715
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:57,250
- That'd be all she wrote.
- Torque wrench, please.

716
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:00,760
Here.

717
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:06,221
- I wish I could've met my real dad.
- You will.

718
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:11,021
Yeah, I guess.
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

719
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:15,479
I sent him back through time
to 1984.

720
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:17,561
Man!

721
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:21,569
He hasn't even been born yet.

722
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:25,284
It messes with your head.

723
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:30,532
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

724
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:40,922
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

725
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:46,303
She still loves him, I guess.
I see her crying sometimes.

726
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:47,928
She denies it totally, of course,

727
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:50,932
like she got something
stuck in her eye.

728
01:29:55,181 --> 01:29:56,683
Why do you cry?

729
01:29:57,809 --> 01:29:59,607
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

730
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,280
I don't know. We just cry.

731
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:05,575
You know, when it hurts.

732
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:16,871
- Pain causes it?
- Er... no. It's different.

733
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:20,048
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyways.

734
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,670
- Get it?
- No.

735
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:24,636
All right, my man!

736
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:28,056
- No prob/em o-
- Give me five.

737
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:32,515
Just put out your hand, like this.

738
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:37,608
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

739
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:39,855
All right!

740
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:45,115
OK, that's good. Up high! High five!

741
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:47,358
Five low.

742
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,069
Too slow.

743
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:54,366
I'm just kidding. One more time.

744
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,668
Good. Now try it. Good!

745
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,620
Now do me. Give me five.

746
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,332
'Watching John
with the machine,

747
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,713
it was suddenly so clear.

748
01:31:04,918 --> 01:31:07,888
'The Terminator would never stop.

749
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:11,763
'It would never leave him
and it would never hurt him,

750
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:15,392
'never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him

751
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:17,893
'or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.

752
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:23,654
'It would always be there
and it would die to protect him.

753
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:28,401

who came and went over the years,

01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:32,954

'In an insane world,
it was the sanest choice.'

756
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:16,248
Come here, darling.

757
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,226
Hey, let's try this one.

758
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:25,145
There we go.

759
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:13,795
She said you go south
with him like you planned.

760
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,004
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

761
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:18,964
Mom, wait!

762
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:36,155
"No fate".

763
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:39,701
"No fate, but what we make."

764
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:43,488
My father told her this.

765
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:51,088
I mean, I made him memorise it
in the future as a message to her.

766
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:57,507
Never mind.
Now, OK, the whole thing goes...

767
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:00,338
The future's not set.

768
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:03,971
There's no fate,
but what we make for ourselves.

769
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:08,681
- She intends to change the future.
- Yeah, I guess.

770
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:11,857
Oh, shit!

771
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:13,856
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

772
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:17,439
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

773
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:19,524
She's gonna blow him away.

774
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:21,609
Come on! Let's go!

775
01:36:21,818 --> 01:36:23,491
Let's go! Come on!

776
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:37,251
- This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

777
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:41,213
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do. It knows what I know.

778
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:45,927
- It might anticipate this move.
- I don't care. We gotta stop her.

779
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:48,512
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

780
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,438
I don't care!

781
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:52,436
Haven't you learned anything yet?

782
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,813
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

783
01:36:57,687 --> 01:37:00,531
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die.

784
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:03,822
But everybody's not like that!
We have feelings.

785
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:05,950
We hurt. We're afraid.

786
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:12,786
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

787
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:53,080
Danny, I told you
to go to bed. I'm not kidding.

788
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,286
Just a couple of minutes,
Mom!

789
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,810
Danny, your time is up.

790
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:17,691
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

791
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:47,554
Danny!

792
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:50,633
Ugh!

793
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:03,063
- Daddy!
- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!

794
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:05,819
Miles?

795
01:39:09,569 --> 01:39:10,991
Miles!

796
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:13,493
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

797
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:22,628
Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!

798
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:23,958
Run!

799
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:25,794
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

800
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:47,240
Daddy!
' Danny! Danny!

801
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,944
- Nobody fucking move!
- Don't hurt my daddy!

802
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:54,827
Get down on the floor, bitch.
Get down now!

803
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:56,783
Get out of the way.

804
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:58,584
Don't hurt him!

805
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:01,833
Get on the floor now!

806
01:40:04,123 --> 01:40:06,592
Just let the boy go.

807
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:09,636
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

808
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:12,306
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

809
01:40:12,507 --> 01:40:14,635
- It's all your fault!
- What?

810
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:16,844
I'm not gonna let you do it.

811
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:36,614
Shhh!

812
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:42,085
Shhh.

813
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:11,316
Shit! We're too late!

814
01:41:15,528 --> 01:41:16,529
Check them.

815
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:23,745
Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?

816
01:41:24,704 --> 01:41:26,251
Look at me.

817
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:30,217
I almost...

818
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:32,341
I almost...

819
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:46,188
It'll be OK. It's gonna be OK.
We'll figure something out. OK?

820
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:49,487
I promise.

821
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:58,534
- You came here to stop me.
- Yeah, I did.

822
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:03,414
I love you, John.

823
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:07,422
I always have.

824
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:10,716
I know.

825
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:19,221
Deep penetration.

826
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:22,766
No shattered bone.

827
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:25,769
You hold here. The pressure
should stop the bleeding.

828
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:39,866
- Who are you people?
- Show him.

829
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:47,207
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

830
01:43:00,257 --> 01:43:03,386
Oh, God! No!

831
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:18,154
Oh, my God!

832
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:28,912
Oh, my God.

833
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,589
Now, listen to me very carefully.

834
01:43:33,999 --> 01:43:37,378
Nuclear winter effects
caused massive cooling...

835
01:43:37,586 --> 01:43:41,636
'Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.

836
01:43:41,841 --> 01:43:45,436
'Skynet. Judgment Day.

837
01:43:45,636 --> 01:43:48,685
'The history of things to come.

838
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,358
'It's not every day that you find out

839
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:54,938
you're responsible
for three billion deaths.

840
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:57,740
'He took it pretty well.'

841
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:01,744
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

842
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:12,839
You're judging me
on things I haven't even done yet.

843
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:19,212
How were we supposed to know?

844
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:22,924
Yeah!

845
01:44:23,132 --> 01:44:24,634
Right.

846
01:44:25,551 --> 01:44:28,646
How were you supposed to know?

847
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:32,441
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

848
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:36,862
Men like you thought it up.

849
01:44:40,649 --> 01:44:43,698
You think you're so creative.

850
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:46,952
You don't know what it's like
to really create something,

851
01:44:47,156 --> 01:44:50,751
to create a life,
to feel it growing inside you.

852
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:53,204
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

853
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:54,789
Mom!

854
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:59,378
We need to be a little more
constructive here. OK?

855
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:01,553
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

856
01:45:01,754 --> 01:45:03,472
But I thought...

857
01:45:04,673 --> 01:45:08,519
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

858
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:12,269
That's right. There's no way
I'm gonna finish the new processor.

859
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:15,147
Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.

860
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:18,946
- I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- That's not good enough.

861
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:22,150
- No one must follow your work.
- Right.

862
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:27,080
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab:

863
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:31,705
the files, the disk drives,
everything, everything here.

864
01:45:32,535 --> 01:45:35,379
Everything. I don't care.

865
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:38,169
The chip.

866
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:40,338
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

867
01:45:40,543 --> 01:45:42,045
They keep it in a vault
at Cyberdyne.

868
01:45:42,253 --> 01:45:43,505
It must be from
the other one like you.

869
01:45:43,712 --> 01:45:48,092
- The CPU from the first Terminator.
- Son of a bitch! I knew it!

870
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:50,894
They told us
not to ask where they got it.

871
01:45:51,095 --> 01:45:53,314
Those lying motherfuckers.

872
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:55,187
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

873
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:57,519
I mean,
it was smashed, it didn't work,

874
01:45:57,726 --> 01:45:59,103
but it gave us ideas,

875
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:02,190
took us in new directions,
things we would've never th...

876
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:06,443
All my work was based on it.

877
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:08,325
It must be destroyed.

878
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:13,626
Can you get us in? Past security?

879
01:46:13,826 --> 01:46:16,750
I think so, yeah. When?

880
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:21,758
Now?

881
01:46:26,005 --> 01:46:28,679
'The future,
always so clear to me,

882
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:31,807
'had become
like a black highway at night.

883
01:46:32,011 --> 01:46:37,563
'We were in uncharted territory now,
making up history as we went along.'

884
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:17,516
Hi. Er... Carl, right?

885
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:21,109
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

886
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:22,360
Hi!

887
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,647
...take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

888
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:28,029
Mr Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

889
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:30,235
I need written authorisation...

890
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:35,166
- I insist.
- Don't even think about it.

891
01:47:46,126 --> 01:47:47,673
Come on. It's OK.

892
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:50,465
It takes two keys to open the vault.

893
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:52,266
They have
to be turned simultaneously.

894
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:55,140
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

895
01:47:56,762 --> 01:47:58,014
Gibbons?

896
01:48:01,266 --> 01:48:05,942
Gibbons! Come on, man!
You can't leave the desk like that!

897
01:48:08,232 --> 01:48:09,484
Gibbons!

898
01:48:10,985 --> 01:48:12,282
Oh, shit.

899
01:48:30,254 --> 01:48:32,302
My card should access this.

900
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:38,138
- What? What is it?
- Damn it.

901
01:48:39,388 --> 01:48:41,186
The silent alarm's been tripped.

902
01:48:47,312 --> 01:48:50,111
It's neutralised all the codes
in the entire building.

903
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:53,910
Nothing will open anywhere now.
We have to abort.

904
01:48:55,154 --> 01:48:56,576
No.

905
01:48:58,282 --> 01:49:01,456
We go all the way. OK?

906
01:49:03,746 --> 01:49:07,421
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

907
01:49:07,624 --> 01:49:09,046
I think it's that guy from the mall.

908
01:49:09,251 --> 01:49:10,173
It is!

909
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:12,550
It's him and the woman.

910
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:16,725
Look, just send everything
you got in the area right now.

911
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:22,557
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

912
01:49:27,227 --> 01:49:29,400
- It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

913
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:36,619
John, fire in the hold!

914
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:53,467
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the halon system.

915
01:50:00,761 --> 01:50:03,105
You have
to wait until the gas clears.

916
01:50:05,724 --> 01:50:06,850
Put this on.

917
01:50:21,115 --> 01:50:23,368
All right, let's get to work.

918
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:48,229
All units in the vicinity,
all units able to respond:

919
01:50:48,433 --> 01:50:52,939
A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer
Street, the Cyberdyne building.

920
01:50:53,272 --> 01:50:55,195
Suspect 1 is white, female,

921
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:58,403
identified as: last name Connor,
first name Sarah,

922
01:50:58,610 --> 01:51:01,238
escaped from
Pescadero State Hospital.

923
01:51:01,738 --> 01:51:03,035
Suspect 2: white, male...

924
01:51:07,327 --> 01:51:11,377
All the disks in my office. All the
disks in that office over there.

925
01:51:11,623 --> 01:51:13,591
Everything behind my desk.

926
01:51:13,834 --> 01:51:15,836
All the processors on my left.

927
01:51:16,086 --> 01:51:18,339
We'll blow it up with the CP4.

928
01:51:32,144 --> 01:51:33,521
Could I...

929
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:35,568
Excuse me...

930
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:39,902
Could I borrow that thing?

931
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:51,667
I worked a lot
of years on this thing.

932
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:59,964
- Give me that location again.
- 2111, Kramer.

933
01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:03,844
The suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.

934
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:56,733
All right!

935
01:52:56,937 --> 01:52:58,564
7-2-5-6.

936
01:53:00,148 --> 01:53:01,070
Yes!

937
01:53:05,862 --> 01:53:07,159
Easy money.

938
01:53:11,952 --> 01:53:13,295
Uh-oh.

939
01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:18,296
Oh, shit! Not good.

940
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:19,672
Not good!

941
01:53:23,505 --> 01:53:26,759
- How we doing?
- Primer cord is set.

942
01:53:26,967 --> 01:53:29,220
One more barrel, two more minutes.

943
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:36,110
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

944
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:38,563
Piece of cake.

945
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:40,192
- We got company.
- Police?

946
01:53:40,397 --> 01:53:43,617
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

947
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:45,740
Go. I'll finish here.

948
01:53:47,195 --> 01:53:48,492
Come on.

949
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:52,872
- I'll take care of the police.
- Wait! You swore!

950
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:57,248
Trust me.

951
01:54:10,677 --> 01:54:12,554
'You at the window!

952
01:54:12,763 --> 01:54:15,733
'Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!'

953
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:20,484
- Holy shit!
- That's a damn mini-gun!

954
01:54:42,959 --> 01:54:45,132
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

955
01:54:45,337 --> 01:54:46,714
Go! Go! Go!

956
01:55:34,428 --> 01:55:35,805
Fire!

957
01:55:53,113 --> 01:55:54,865
We go same time, to the left.

958
01:55:55,073 --> 01:55:57,667
One, two, three, go.

959
01:56:09,588 --> 01:56:12,137
All right, in order to get that out,
you have to...

960
01:56:19,848 --> 01:56:23,478
We got Skynet by the balls now,
don't we? Come on, let's book.

961
01:56:24,853 --> 01:56:26,196
Hold your fire!

962
01:56:51,838 --> 01:56:54,091
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

963
01:56:57,594 --> 01:57:00,222
Time to go. Now.

964
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:03,229
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

965
01:57:03,433 --> 01:57:06,403
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

966
01:57:31,002 --> 01:57:33,425
Mom! Mom!

967
01:58:11,376 --> 01:58:13,003
Aagh!

968
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:18,887
Shit!

969
01:58:20,468 --> 01:58:23,347
Shit! She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

970
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:34,399
Get down!

971
01:58:41,656 --> 01:58:42,908
Here.

972
01:59:08,642 --> 01:59:11,441
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

973
01:59:16,274 --> 01:59:18,993
Fall back! Everybody out!

974
01:59:19,194 --> 01:59:20,946
Fall back now! Go! Go! Go!

975
01:59:57,107 --> 01:59:58,324
'We got a war zone
down here!

976
02:00:30,765 --> 02:00:32,267
Shut your eyes.

977
02:00:38,732 --> 02:00:41,736
Stay here. I'll be back.

978
02:00:49,951 --> 02:00:51,874
Get down on the floor, face down!

979
02:00:55,123 --> 02:00:56,170
Down on the floor now!

980
02:00:58,668 --> 02:01:00,011
OK, drop him!

981
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:39,717
Agh!

982
02:02:20,041 --> 02:02:21,793
Here, hold this.

983
02:02:34,097 --> 02:02:35,895
I think it's him!

984
02:02:38,268 --> 02:02:39,736
Holy shit!

985
02:02:55,368 --> 02:02:56,244
Go!

986
02:03:35,325 --> 02:03:36,417
Shit!

987
02:03:49,505 --> 02:03:50,882
Get out.

988
02:03:53,343 --> 02:03:54,845
Aagh!

989
02:04:10,234 --> 02:04:14,034
Listen. No matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

990
02:04:14,238 --> 02:04:15,660
- You got it?
- Yeah.

991
02:04:15,865 --> 02:04:17,367
All right.

992
02:04:31,589 --> 02:04:33,887
- Chopper's coming in!
- It's him.

993
02:05:31,816 --> 02:05:33,033
Yeah!

994
02:05:35,403 --> 02:05:37,076
John! Stay down!

995
02:06:02,722 --> 02:06:04,190
Aagh!
" Mom!

996
02:06:45,348 --> 02:06:46,224
Hello?

997
02:06:52,313 --> 02:06:54,407
Goddamn! You all right...?

998
02:07:01,948 --> 02:07:03,916
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

999
02:07:06,410 --> 02:07:08,162
- Take the shotgun.
- OK.

1000
02:07:10,289 --> 02:07:11,085
- Agh!

1001
02:07:12,208 --> 02:07:13,425
Are you hurt?

1002
02:07:26,264 --> 02:07:30,064
- Holy shit! Come on, Mom. Come on!
- We need your truck.

1003
02:07:30,768 --> 02:07:31,610
Hurry!

1004
02:07:36,774 --> 02:07:39,618
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

1005
02:07:40,361 --> 02:07:43,365
Come on! Go!

1006
02:07:49,495 --> 02:07:51,372
What the hell...?

1007
02:07:57,837 --> 02:08:00,010
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

1008
02:08:02,008 --> 02:08:03,305
Here. This'll work.

1009
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:11,351
He's gaining.

1010
02:08:13,311 --> 02:08:16,110
- Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

1011
02:08:16,314 --> 02:08:18,362
I can run faster than this!

1012
02:08:28,701 --> 02:08:29,998
Coming up, to the right.

1013
02:08:32,663 --> 02:08:34,006
Watch it! Watch it!

1014
02:08:56,938 --> 02:08:58,690
- Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

1015
02:09:06,572 --> 02:09:08,119
Take the off-ramp.

1016
02:09:18,167 --> 02:09:18,963
Shit!

1017
02:09:23,005 --> 02:09:23,881
Hold on!

1018
02:10:09,885 --> 02:10:10,681
Don't stop!

1019
02:10:19,437 --> 02:10:20,609
Go straight!

1020
02:10:22,690 --> 02:10:24,158
- Look out!
- Duck!

1021
02:10:39,415 --> 02:10:40,917
Get the hell outta here!

1022
02:10:46,881 --> 02:10:49,555
Get outta here! Let's go!

1023
02:12:06,752 --> 02:12:08,925
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

1024
02:12:59,013 --> 02:12:59,980
We don't have much time.

1025
02:13:23,078 --> 02:13:23,874
Let's go.

1026
02:13:25,164 --> 02:13:26,711
Come on, Mom.
We gotta get outta here.

1027
02:13:26,916 --> 02:13:28,884
Come on! Get up!

1028
02:13:42,765 --> 02:13:44,187
Hand me the shotgun.

1029
02:13:49,146 --> 02:13:51,274
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1030
02:13:52,358 --> 02:13:53,985
Hurry!

1031
02:13:57,696 --> 02:13:59,198
Come on, Mom.

1032
02:14:05,788 --> 02:14:08,007
- Agh!
- Come on, Mom. Get up! Come on!

1033
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:39,947
This way. Come on!

1034
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:12,109
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

1035
02:15:12,313 --> 02:15:13,439
Go back.

1036
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:23,908
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1037
02:15:24,533 --> 02:15:26,001
John, you've got to go now.

1038
02:15:26,201 --> 02:15:28,203
- John!
- Go! Now!

1039
02:15:28,412 --> 02:15:29,755
No!

1040
02:16:43,028 --> 02:16:44,655
Get up the steps.

1041
02:16:46,657 --> 02:16:47,829
Go on.

1042
02:16:54,289 --> 02:16:56,291
Come on, Mom.
I got you. Come on.

1043
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:22,696
No!

1044
02:17:30,951 --> 02:17:33,170
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1045
02:17:34,538 --> 02:17:37,166
Grab it. Go. Go!

1046
02:17:47,801 --> 02:17:50,805
Mom, come on! Mom! Mom!

1047
02:17:51,013 --> 02:17:52,481
Come on!

1048
02:17:53,390 --> 02:17:54,983
Mom!

1049
02:17:55,184 --> 02:17:57,357
Mom! Mom! Mom!

1050
02:18:33,430 --> 02:18:34,852
Agh!

1051
02:18:40,479 --> 02:18:41,401
Call to John.

1052
02:18:43,398 --> 02:18:44,524
No!

1053
02:18:45,067 --> 02:18:46,284
I know this hurts.

1054
02:18:47,277 --> 02:18:49,746
- Ugh!
- Call John.

1055
02:19:07,172 --> 02:19:09,095
Call to John now.

1056
02:19:11,218 --> 02:19:12,515
Fuck you!

1057
02:22:24,327 --> 02:22:27,877
John? John!

1058
02:22:29,249 --> 02:22:31,468
John? Help!

1059
02:22:34,212 --> 02:22:35,589
John!

1060
02:22:39,384 --> 02:22:41,057
John?

1061
02:22:43,388 --> 02:22:44,731
John!

1062
02:22:46,850 --> 02:22:48,067
John.

1063
02:22:49,019 --> 02:22:50,521
John.

1064
02:22:53,106 --> 02:22:54,733
- Mom.
- Help me.

1065
02:22:56,026 --> 02:22:57,778
Help me.

1066
02:22:59,321 --> 02:23:00,322
Help me.

1067
02:23:00,530 --> 02:23:01,656
Out of the way, John!

1068
02:23:05,243 --> 02:23:06,119
<i>Shoo“</i>

1069
02:23:49,871 --> 02:23:51,293
Mom!

1070
02:24:01,049 --> 02:24:02,517
Get down!

1071
02:24:34,249 --> 02:24:35,717
No!

1072
02:25:36,895 --> 02:25:39,114
Get up. Come on.

1073
02:25:41,316 --> 02:25:42,863
Holy shit!

1074
02:25:43,068 --> 02:25:44,741
I need a vacation.

1075
02:25:59,251 --> 02:26:02,926
- Is it dead?
- Terminated.

1076
02:26:06,466 --> 02:26:08,059
Will this melt in there?

1077
02:26:11,304 --> 02:26:12,897
Yes. Throw it in.

1078
02:26:17,769 --> 02:26:18,611
<i>A 070's!</i>

1079
02:26:20,647 --> 02:26:22,820
And the chip.

1080
02:26:37,289 --> 02:26:38,711
It's over.

1081
02:26:41,251 --> 02:26:42,298
No.

1082
02:26:45,839 --> 02:26:47,216
There's one more chip.

1083
02:26:52,220 --> 02:26:54,188
And it must be destroyed also.

1084
02:26:59,853 --> 02:27:01,230
Here.

1085
02:27:01,438 --> 02:27:05,443
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1086
02:27:11,072 --> 02:27:12,619
No.

1087
02:27:13,908 --> 02:27:14,704
No.

1088
02:27:18,079 --> 02:27:20,457
- I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
- No!

1089
02:27:20,665 --> 02:27:22,667
No, it'll be OK. Stay with us.

1090
02:27:22,876 --> 02:27:24,753
- It'll be OK.
- I have to go away.

1091
02:27:24,961 --> 02:27:27,430
No, don't do it. Please, don't go.

1092
02:27:27,630 --> 02:27:30,383
- I must go away, John.
- No!

1093
02:27:31,051 --> 02:27:32,143
No, wait.

1094
02:27:32,344 --> 02:27:35,097
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

1095
02:27:36,264 --> 02:27:38,312
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1096
02:27:38,767 --> 02:27:40,314
It has to end here.

1097
02:27:41,644 --> 02:27:44,818
I order you not to go!
I order you not to go!

1098
02:27:45,023 --> 02:27:46,525
I order you not to go!

1099
02:27:53,073 --> 02:27:54,825
I know now why you cry.

1100
02:27:57,327 --> 02:27:59,500
But it's something I can never do.

1101
02:28:34,614 --> 02:28:36,207
Good bye.

1102

<i>August 29, 1997, came and went.</i>

1103
02:30:20,220 --> 02:30:21,847
<i>Nothing much happened.</i>

1104
02:30:22,055 --> 02:30:24,308
<i>Michael Jackson turned 40.</i>

John fights the war differently
than it was foretold.

Here, on the battlefield
of the Senate

1119

Tie me, Grandma. Tie me!

1122
