1
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,562
The heat wave continues.
lt's 109 degrees in Los Angeles.

2
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,777
As drought-ridden Los Angeles
swelters in agonizing heat,

3
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,696
drug lords wage warfare in the streets.

4
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:57,700
Yet another open conflict...
Oh, fuck this! Get me out of here!

5
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:12,215
We're in a war zone, Dave: two motorcycle
officers horribly wounded in a crossfire,

6
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,550
the police seemingly
unable to rescue them

7
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,345
in spite of several
desperate, heroic attempts.

8
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,681
lt's completely out of control down here.

9
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,483
My beautiful cantina,
everything l own, they shot it to pieces.

10
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:36,572
My microwave, my automatic steamer,
my grill... You fucking pendejos!

11
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,524
Fuck you!

12
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,364
Tony Pope, live with Hard Core,
on the scene and in your face.

13
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,535
lt's like Dante's hell:
smoke, fire, oppressive heat,

14
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:28,666
as Colombian and Jamaican drug fiends
again transform LA into a slaughterhouse.

15
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,169
Who the hell's in charge down here?
The cops? Uh-uh.

16
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,464
They're outmanned,
outgunned and incompetent.

17
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,551
Mr. Mayor,
on vacation in your home in Lake Tahoe,

18
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,471
get off your butt,
get down here and declare martial law!

19
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,750
OK, don't keep me in suspense,
Danny boy!

20
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,085
lt has not been a nice day!

21
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,090
Two motors pulled over a truck, stumbled
right in the middle of a narc stakeout.

22
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:22,386
You know, ten Colombians
and Scorpios armed to fuck all.

23
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,305
They're trying to get in their headquarters.

24
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,935
We're keeping them pinned down,
but those officers are bleeding to death.

25
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:34,690
- Fuck! They're dying, man.
- Where the hell is Special Weapons?

26
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,903
They're still tied up in that shootout
in San Pedro with the Jamaicans.

27
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,529
They shot down a chopper.

28
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:45,117
Mills and Johnson won't last much longer.
We need an assault vehicle to go get 'em.

29
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,412
l'm gonna chat with these assholes.
When l give the signal,

30
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,831
- give me some cover!
- Got it!

31
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,891
Too small.

32
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,560
Right.

33
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:51,559
Come on! Come on!
Get 'em out of here! Now!

34
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,940
Vamonos!

35
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,779
Get 'em out! Get 'em out!

36
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,632
- Vamonos!
- Vamonos!

37
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,407
Hey, assholes!

38
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,306
- Mike, are you OK?
- Yeah. Let's get the rest.

39
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,103
We can't. Orders from Chief Heinemann.
He says surround building and wait.

40
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,105
- Wait for what?
- l don't know!

41
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,483
Some bullshit special unit.
The feds, the DEA.

42
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,986
lf we let those bastards get dug in now,
we'll have to level the building!

43
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,950
- Hijo de puta.
- No, es para mi.

44
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,620
- Vamonos! Vamonos!
- Venga! Aprisa!

45
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:39,458
Venga! Chingale! Chingale!

46
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:50,636
Come and get it. El Scorpio is ready.

47
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,568
- Sarge, any of your people in the building?
- No.

48
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,361
Let's go.

49
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,531
Lieutenant, can't let you in.
Heinemann's on his way.

50
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,951
Heinemann can kiss my sweet ass!
Come on!

51
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,245
Goddamn it. Go with him.

52
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,273
Three, two, one...

53
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,941
Go!

54
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,784
Get back.

55
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,539
Next door over.

56
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,850
Take this room!

57
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,024
First floor, officer down. We need backup.

58
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,421
Freeze! l said hold it!

59
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:54,468
Now, lay your guns down.
You can walk down or fly, it's your choice.

60
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,929
l said put it down, asshole!

61
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,849
No!

62
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,002
- Let's do it now!
- Take it easy.

63
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,843
Damn, it's hot.

64
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,162
Must be losing it.

65
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,999
Mike!

66
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,668
Spread out. Secure the roof.

67
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,296
Just take it easy. l'm right here.

68
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,342
All clear. All clear on the site.

69
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:21,555
Oh, Danny boy.
l gotta get down from here.

70
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,267
Shit.

71
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,813
OK, search the roof.
Check every floor. Maybe someone else...

72
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:34,943
Seal it off. No one leaves.
Danny, get me off this damn roof.

73
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,115
- You get the rest of them?
- Somebody beat us to it.

74
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,462
Leona.

75
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,311
Oh, shit.

76
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,962
- What happened to El Scorpio?
- He's out front having lunch.

77
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,589
What the hell is this?

78
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:42,136
l don't know. They've been cut to pieces.
Must be the Jamaicans.

79
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,347
Their style, but where the hell did they go?

80
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,852
OK, nobody gets in here
until Forensic arrives. Nobody.

81
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,854
OK, you know the drill.

82
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,677
Mike. Up there.

83
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:35,272
He must have been killed out here,
and then someone...

84
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:41,737
That's about 35, 40 feet.
No rope, no ladder.

85
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:47,784
The guy weighs about 1 90, 1 95 pounds.
You couldn't carry him up there.

86
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,621
Lieutenant?

87
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:55,250
Deputy Chief Heinemann's downstairs.
He wants you out of the building now.

88
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,961
Son of a bitch.

89
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:02,508
- What the fuck is going on?
- This is not good, Mike. Not good at all.

90
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,766
- l want a real name on this joker, OK?
- You got it.

91
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,017
Mike.

92
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:18,190
Phil, this is quite a surprise.
What brings you down from the palace?

93
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:22,778
You let me down, Mike.
You're making me look bad.

94
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,113
l thought we had an understanding.

95
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,452
l put my ass on the line to get you here,
and all l expect is a little cooperation!

96
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,665
You were told this was a federal matter.

97
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,459
Yet you disobeyed an order
to stay out of the building.

98
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,338
Don't let this get out, Phil,
but it's a fucking war down here.

99
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,132
Soldiers take orders. Don't push it!

100
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:48,053
l'll push it as far as l can, Phil,
cos we're fighting for our lives here,

101
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,932
while you're downtown
pushing pencils and kissing ass!

102
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,437
l don't roll over for anybody,
especially the feds,

103
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,648
without a goddamn good explanation!

104
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:27,551
Take this equipment up to the third floor.
Come on, let's move!

105
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,315
- Let's go.
- Excuse me, sir!

106
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,775
What the hell is going on here,
Heinemann?

107
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,737
lnsubordination.
Disregard for direct orders

108
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,447
from a supervising officer.

109
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,033
Now get back to your cage at Alvarado.

110
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,744
l'll show you insubordination, you son of...

111
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,705
- No!
- Where you running to? Come here!

112
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,458
You don't need this, Mike.
lt's not worth it.

113
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,711
- Relax.
- Oh, fuck!

114
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,025
l have an update for you.

115
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,570
ln a shootout, five members
of one Colombian drug gang

116
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:33,116
were ambushed by their bloody rivals,
the Jamaican Voodoo Posse,

117
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:37,204
who escaped without a trace -
again making total fools of...

118
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,248
- A detective is here to see you.
- Back there.

119
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:45,128
Listen, lady, you got a backed-up toilet.
Call a plumber, not the cops.

120
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:50,133
- This license has expired.
- Bullshit! l paid that fee six months ago.

121
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,886
- l'll kick your ass!
- Sit down! Right now!

122
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,556
- Move! Get your ass movin'!
- Just calm the fuck down!

123
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,103
What you lookin' at?

124
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:08,568
And all you got to do
is tee it high and let it fly.

125
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,446
Dead solid perfect.

126
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:16,702
Now, remember, for distance
you gotta gently but firmly grip the club.

127
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:20,205
Lieutenant Harrigan!
Detective Lambert, Rampart Division.

128
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,333
Hey, kid, just have a seat.
l'll be right with you.

129
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,752
- Hey, Cap.
- Don't start, Mike.

130
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,546
Heinemann's already
been up my ass so far

131
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,216
l won't be able to sit down for a week.
We're not winning this war.

132
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,678
As much as it'll piss you off,
you'll have to play the game.

133
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,431
"Effective immediately,
a federal task force

134
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:41,435
under Special Agent Peter Keyes
will investigate criminal activities

135
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,398
involving the trafficking
of controlled substances."

136
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,568
And you will extend him
your full cooperation.

137
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,446
So you're cutting off my dick
and shoving it up my ass.

138
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,616
The feds are calling the shots on this.
My hands are tied!

139
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:01,037
- Yeah?
- Captain Pilgrim, Peter Keyes.

140
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,957
- lt's good to meet you.
- And you, sir.

141
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,461
Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.
Special Agent Peter Keyes, DEA.

142
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,088
Heard a lot about you.

143
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:16,386
l'm sorry for this jurisdictional intrusion.
Don't mean to be stepping on your toes.

144
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,764
But we want to prevent
King Willie's voodoo gangs

145
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:23,518
from taking over the entire West Coast.

146
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,687
l wish l could tell you more.

147
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:29,775
But we have a large number
of deep-cover operatives involved.

148
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:34,070
You know how it is.
We all have a job to do.

149
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,448
Now, l'm sure we can respect
each other's situation

150
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,701
and act responsibly.

151
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,120
Well,

152
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:45,373
cooperation

153
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,167
is my middle name.

154
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,634
l'll see you around.

155
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,519
- l'm the new transfer, Jerry Lambert.
- Like l said, have a seat.

156
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,937
l'll be right with you.

157
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,940
- Who is this dude?
- Yeah, what an asshole.

158
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,277
All right, Danny boy, what we got?

159
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:18,490
What have we got? Five lowlife Scorpions
make it into the building.

160
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:23,328
The next minute they're all shish kabob.
Not one bullet wound.

161
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,081
lt wasn't drugs or money.
There's a shitload of that.

162
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,377
Maybe King Willie brought in some
outside talent. He's making his big move.

163
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,754
A pro would have split
the moment he heard us.

164
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,006
More than one, we would have seen them.

165
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,134
Whoever did this
waited until the last minute,

166
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:42,681
and then took out four men
armed with machine guns by hand!

167
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,016
And then got by us.

168
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,311
Maybe we should give him a job.
Let's put him on the payroll.

169
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:52,357
So me and my partner bolt up the stairs,
somebody is screaming bloody murder...

170
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,193
- You gotta hear this.
- What?!

171
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:59,281
Hey, l forgot to tell you.
See that guy there?

172
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,868
That's Ferris's replacement.

173
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:06,872
This guy's Jerry Lambert.
The Lone Ranger from Rampart station.

174
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,665
That's the Lone Ranger?

175
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,626
l thought he was here
to fix the air conditioning.

176
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,255
l said "Lady, you are under arrest."
And she said "Why?"

177
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,967
l said "Because your husband is dead.
You killed him."

178
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,678
- Know what she said, didn't miss a beat?
- No.

179
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,347
She said "l stabbed that
son of a bitch plenty of times.

180
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,850
He never died on me before."

181
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:34,316
Looks like he's putting the moves
to Leona.

182
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,443
His first big mistake.

183
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,575
- l have heard about you.
- Yeah?

184
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,786
- Like your last partner got shot.
- What?

185
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,080
Well...

186
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:54,461
You try that cowboy shit with me, fucker,
you can kiss these goodbye.

187
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,047
- Got it?
- Yeah, l got it.

188
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:01,927
Well, well, l see that
the three of you have met.

189
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:06,890
Lambert, if you're feeling up to it,
why don't you limp your way in

190
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,644
to the lieutenant. He wants to talk to you.

191
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,649
- You're a bad girl.
- l like that.

192
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,070
Goddamn, is that bitch on the rag
or what?

193
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,121
This is what l call "the speech," kid.
l only give it once, so pay attention.

194
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:35,043
Until now, it's all been fun and games,
cops and robbers, dunking doughnuts.

195
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:40,340
But you're in the shit now.
Metro Command is a war zone.

196
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,636
Lieutenant, l've paid my dues.
l had to bust my ass to get my transfer.

197
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,638
And that scares the shit out of me, kid.

198
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,641
No one requests to come here
unless they want a reputation.

199
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:54,479
There's no room for anyone looking
to prove themselves. l won't stand for it.

200
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:59,651
Don't get me wrong. We need good cops,
and they say you're good at what you do.

201
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,070
But the team comes first.

202
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:06,157
You live by that, and you'll be OK.
And we'll all be there for you.

203
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,912
Remember, the door swings both ways.
That's it.

204
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,253
Hey, kid.

205
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,256
Welcome to the war.

206
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,244
OK, guys. This has gone too far now, huh?

207
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,082
Hey, guys.

208
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:00,503
l know you're trying to scare me, huh?

209
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:05,467
Well, you did a pretty good job, man.
l'm scared now.

210
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:14,225
Stop it now. l can pay you.
$2 million, man. ln cash.

211
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,353
- Right now!
- This is not about money.

212
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,732
This is about power!

213
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:26,529
There's a new king in the streets.
This is a message he has for your people.

214
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:31,826
You are history.
Fucking history, goddamn puto.

215
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:46,174
What the fuck are you doing now, man?
You're crazy!

216
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,135
King Willie says

217
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,639
not only do l have to kill you,

218
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,269
but l have to take your soul.

219
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,862
Voodoo magic.
Fucking voodoo magic, man.

220
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,204
But you know what?
l tell you what l believe.

221
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,917
Shit happens.

222
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,976
Shoot it!

223
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,718
Fucker!

224
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,287
Shit happens.

225
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,719
l'm standing just outside
a penthouse complex in San Pedro...

226
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:58,431
..involving as many as 20 people.
lt's uncertain who they were.

227
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:02,477
One report indicates it might be
the feared Jamaican Voodoo Posse.

228
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:07,649
l go in for my physical and the doctor says
"l need a semen, stool and urine sample."

229
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:12,278
l say "Gee, doc, l'm in a big hurry.
Can l just leave my underwear?"

230
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:13,655
Oh, God.

231
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,911
Word is there may be as many as
50 more dead bodies up there.

232
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,873
Oh, man, it's Pope.
That parasite must live in his car.

233
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,584
l'll handle it. PR's my specialty.

234
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:28,920
Word is they want your ass off the job.

235
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,214
- Tony!
- Who the hell are you?

236
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,925
Your biggest fan!
Catch your show all the time.

237
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,093
l got a job to do!

238
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,095
Yourjob is to root for garbage elsewhere.

239
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,930
- Been inside?
- Yeah.

240
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,350
We were gonna go in with our guys,
but we were told on a radio transmission

241
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,811
nobody goes in under any circumstances.

242
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:50,608
All units, be advised.
Federal officers will handle investigation.

243
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:53,528
- We didn't hear that. Let's go.
- You're the boss.

244
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,948
This is Cheryl Tyer reporting live...

245
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,867
Hey, nice flashlight. Mind if l borrow it?

246
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,043
OK.

247
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,430
Damn!

248
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,435
Look familiar?

249
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,313
Fuck.

250
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,232
Oh, God.

251
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:37,655
Ramon Vega, the crack king. Biggest
operator in East LA. 1 00 keys a week.

252
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,577
- Why isn't he skinned? And who are they?
- Jamaicans. King Willie's boys.

253
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,621
That makes no sense.
This was a voodoo ritual.

254
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,499
l've seen it before. They took his heart out.

255
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,835
- What for?
- Terror tactics, man.

256
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,672
You know,
to scare the shit out of their enemies.

257
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:57,592
- King Willie.
- Who the hell is King Willie?

258
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:01,846
King Willie, voodoo priest
of the LA posses.

259
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,183
Ran the terror gangs
for Edward Seaga in Jamaica

260
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,310
till he got too powerful.

261
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,188
The Jamaican chiefs
won't make a move without his approval.

262
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,483
So what the fuck happened? Shit!

263
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,071
Hey, we got a survivor!

264
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,707
What's she saying?

265
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,502
l don't know. She's not making any sense.

266
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,962
She keeps saying
"El diablo vino por ellos."

267
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,756
The devil came for them.

268
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,341
lf it's the Colombians,

269
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,595
why'd they leave their boss hanging
and his girl naked on the floor?

270
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,890
- lt wasn't the Colombians.
- Our friend from the armory.

271
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:51,229
Right. We got a new player in town.

272
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,898
Come over here, Mike. Check this out.

273
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,321
What is that?

274
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,658
Looks like a spear tip or something.

275
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:09,163
This is a restricted area.
l want it cleared immediately.

276
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,749
You're walking on physical evidence.

277
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,085
- We'll take care of her.
- She's with me.

278
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:18,214
Lieutenant, l'd like
a word with you in private, please.

279
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:26,139
They say that persistence
is your most outstanding quality.

280
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:29,267
- l know this is your show...
- You're not listening to me!

281
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,770
You got a big nose and
you're sticking it too far in my business.

282
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,272
Maybe you can hear this.

283
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:38,276
The next time you cross me,
you're gonna turn up missing.

284
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,736
Garber, the man with the camera.

285
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,530
- Get him.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,617
- All right. Let's go.
- Stay away.

287
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:50,163
- Hey, fuck you, man! Give me my camera!
- Shut the fuck up.

288
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,166
Hey, wait a minute!
l got my rights! l'm a journalist.

289
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,586
- Harrigan!
- Shut up. Let's go.

290
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,964
Smells like a cover-up.
The press has a right to know!

291
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:04,051
Take him out of the building. Search him.

292
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,554
Now you get the hell out of here.

293
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,183
Who the hell are you, Keyes?

294
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:13,478
The last person in the world
you wanna fuck with.

295
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,785
Wanna make me proud, kid?

296
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,498
Take your bag of tricks, stay with them,
find out where they take her.

297
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:37,502
Meet me later at La Cita's.
And be careful. These guys are good.

298
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:40,463
Hey, don't worry!
Surveillance is my specialty.

299
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,548
OK, then. Just get going.

300
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,929
Go get 'em, Lone Ranger.

301
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,641
Danny, look here.
We gotta take this real cool.

302
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:55,686
These guys sure aren't the DEA,
but it's still Keyes's party.

303
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,357
You stick around, stay out of sight.
l'll meet you at one o'clock.

304
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:03,778
We'll take a good look at that room, OK?
Hey, wait for me.

305
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,448
Danny boy, no hero stuff, understand?

306
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,789
Watch your ass, Danny boy.

307
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,674
She never made it.

308
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:28,970
The feds were waiting.
Hustled her off in a chopper.

309
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,224
- Let me guess. A silver Alouette?
- That very one.

310
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,854
And guess what. Your pal Keyes
was running the whole show.

311
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:42,441
- And his butt boys.
- Son of a bitch.

312
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,194
You done real good, kid.

313
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,408
Now tomorrow, start a tail on Keyes.
Everything he does, everywhere he goes.

314
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,077
Who knows? You might just get lucky.

315
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:57,790
Lieutenant! Luck is my specialty.

316
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,960
Yeah. l bet it is.

317
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,093
Now, if you'll excuse me, Lieutenant,

318
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:14,307
l got some serious police work
to attend to. Come to Papa.

319
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,687
- Hey, are your balls OK?
- Fine.

320
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,939
How are yours?

321
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,525
- Hey, do you mind? lt's my sister.
- Say what?

322
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,819
Oh, you're not my sister.

323
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:32,908
Son of a bitch.
Who are you really chasing, Keyes?

324
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,745
Time to go to work.

325
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,082
- Shit.
- Danny boy.

326
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,667
Mike?

327
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,633
Oh, God!

328
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,185
Oh, Mother of God!

329
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,325
Lieutenant Michael R Harrigan:

330
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,246
violence prone,
obsessive/compulsive personality,

331
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,207
a history of excessive physical force

332
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:55,045
throughout his 1 8 years
as a Los Angeles police officer.

333
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:00,426
Also responsible for the destruction of
1 1 patrol cars, a city bus...

334
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,887
What about ten commendations for valor

335
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:07,558
and the best felony arrest record
in the history of this department?

336
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:12,980
That and my intervention on your behalf
are the only reasons you still have a job.

337
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,024
lf it were up to the chief,

338
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:19,236
he'd charge you with Detective Archuleta's
death and suspend you.

339
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,742
As it is, he left it in my hands.

340
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,994
Now, this John Wayne attitude

341
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,539
and flagrant disregard for policy
is gonna end now.

342
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,918
No one under my command will impede
the progress of this federal task force

343
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:38,255
headed by Agent Keyes. No one.

344
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,682
That's it. Dismissed.

345
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:59,693
Mike, you're too close to this.
Stay out of it.

346
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,655
lt's a police matter.
They can't keep the department out of it.

347
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:05,366
We'll find Danny's killer.

348
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:10,788
Captain, Danny and l came up together.
1 5 years on the fucking street!

349
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,540
Whoever killed him's gonna pay.
l'm gonna finish it.

350
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,056
Hey, come on. What is this?

351
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,106
Listen, shithead.

352
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:41,819
l don't give a fuck what you want with
this asshole because now it's personal.

353
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,404
And he's a dead man.

354
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:46,615
What you're dealing with
is over your head. l'm warning you...

355
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,827
You! You don't know
what you're dealing with.

356
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:53,080
And l'm warning you.
Stay the fuck out of my way!

357
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:08,846
- l'll take care of him.
- No.

358
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,725
Let him go. We're too close.

359
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:22,109
..claiming as his, turf controlled by the
Jamaican and Colombian drug lords.

360
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:26,030
Watch as we continue our report.

361
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:30,534
Yes, the word is out: LA is up for grabs,
the spoils of our once fine city

362
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,119
going to the ruthless scum

363
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,748
who can spread the most
carnage and blood in our streets.

364
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,875
The latest update on the scoreboard:

365
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:42,546
five assorted trash and one good cop,
one of the best on our force.

366
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,883
Who's next? Where's the mayor?
He's not even in the city...

367
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,552
Forget it. lt's over.

368
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:52,765
Mike, goddamn it. This ain't
your personal little war, you know.

369
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,892
l loved Danny, too.

370
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:58,395
Hey, you told me the only way
you survive is because you're a team.

371
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,482
The door swings both ways. Remember?

372
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:10,699
All right. We'll do it together.

373
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,993
Come on. Talk to me about Keyes.

374
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,120
We've been on him for the last three days.

375
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,498
And they're not looking for drug dealers.

376
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:21,418
Yeah. They've been setting up
weird radar sensors all over downtown.

377
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:24,254
l used my whole repertory
to keep up with them!

378
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,591
l had scanners on them,
but they scrambled my shit up.

379
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:32,638
They had equipment l can't begin to touch.
And then this morning

380
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,432
- l lost 'em.
- We lost them.

381
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:37,601
- Where?
- Vernon and lndustry.

382
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,104
- They disappeared!
- The slaughterhouse district?

383
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,941
Yeah, and in this heat...
l mean, BO and barbecue!

384
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:47,361
Whatever Keyes is looking for,
he's found it, or close to it.

385
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,404
Leona, l want to meet with King Willie.

386
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,741
Willie and l seem to have
the same problem.

387
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:55,911
- ln the meantime, you come with me.
- Mike, it's impossible!

388
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,579
Just do it.

389
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,041
Fuck!

390
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:07,381
- Omega 1 . This is Control.
- This is Omega 1 .

391
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,717
We only have 22 minutes
on safe window of operation.

392
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:15,139
- Yes, sir.
- Verify that final telemetry check.

393
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:20,644
Start your test now.
Scan track three, two, one, mark.

394
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,731
Number six, power up on the UV banks.

395
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:28,819
We're complete on the lower UV banks.
Ready for testing.

396
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,655
Second level,
check for ambient temperature variations.

397
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,241
You got two minutes. Now get going.

398
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,911
To all units. All units, you have

399
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,998
approximately 20 minutes
to finish your task.

400
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,167
- Roger.
- lncrease this UV.

401
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,793
Up 42 percent.

402
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:52,467
Your friend died as the result of
an intrusion in the chest cavity

403
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:55,929
by an edged weapon
that nearly cleaved the heart in two.

404
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,182
Death was instantaneous.

405
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:02,102
He was boned like a fish.
l've never seen anything like this.

406
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,440
Please, do not touch anything.

407
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:13,947
Doctor, what about the other victims?
Anything there?

408
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,451
The federal team
brought in their own forensic examiners.

409
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,163
l am the medical examiner
and the chief pathologist in the city,

410
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,748
and they've cut me out.

411
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:26,418
Any way you can get a look at evidence
the feds have collected?

412
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:30,339
- l mean, they must have run tests.
- lt won't be easy.

413
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,633
Doctor,

414
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:36,303
l pried this from Danny's hands.
This is what took him into the rafters.

415
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,932
- lt has almost no weight.
- But it cuts like steel.

416
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,391
Let me see.

417
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:49,149
We are now at 1 50,000 times
normal magnification.

418
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:57,074
Astonishing.
This material doesn't correspond

419
00:42:57,158 --> 00:43:00,077
to anything on the periodic table.

420
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,329
Lieutenant, what the hell is that thing?

421
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,915
Don't know.
lt's not from a hardware store.

422
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,167
- Military?
- Good guess.

423
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:10,087
Either something that got away,
or something they want.

424
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:14,216
Keyes. Ah, we're getting closer now
to what happened...

425
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,637
Hey, no! Easy, kid. Put your gun away.

426
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,014
King Willie will see you now.

427
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,062
lt's OK.

428
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,815
- Don't you want me with you?
- l'll call you later.

429
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:33,235
- You want me to follow you?
- l'll call you later!

430
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,074
You want some ganja, man?

431
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:42,703
License plate number.

432
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:45,622
1 -8-8...
No, no. 1 -8-8-3...

433
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,040
Oh, fuck!

434
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:02,347
The door swings both ways, my ass.
This door swings both ways.

435
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,949
Thanks for the ride.

436
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:26,580
You know,
you guys really ought to cut down.

437
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:13,668
They say you want to talk to me.

438
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:17,714
They say you offering me favors.

439
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:26,932
Tell me why, Babylon. Mr. Policeman.

440
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:30,310
- l want some information.
- lnformation.

441
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:37,109
About the one that's doing all the killing?

442
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:42,364
He killed your people. Now mine.

443
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:48,620
l think you know who he is. l want him.

444
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:52,582
l don't know who he is.

445
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:57,087
But l know where he is.

446
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,424
- The other side.
- What are you talking about?

447
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,760
The spirit world, man.

448
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:09,266
You see, it's always the same.

449
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,519
There's no stopping
what can't be stopped.

450
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,231
No killing what can't be killed.

451
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,984
- Make sense, man.
- This thing

452
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:23,530
that's killing your people and mine
is from the other side.

453
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,700
l can feel him all around.

454
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:31,288
You can't see the eyes of the demon

455
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:33,290
until him come calling.

456
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:40,005
This is dread, man. Truly dread.

457
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:51,975
Nothing else for you here, policeman.
Time to go.

458
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,282
Prepare yourself.

459
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:18,812
"His foundation lie in the holy mountain.
Selah."

460
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:13,867
This is Tony Pope live from LA,
the city of fear.

461
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,704
The psycho-vigilante killer
continues his daily diet for murder.

462
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,331
Bodies strung out,

463
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:23,376
bodies with the skins ripped off,
the hearts torn from the cadavers.

464
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,212
And just recently,
King Willie, the drug lord,

465
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:29,799
the vicious drug lord found
in an alley just around the corner

466
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:34,095
with his head cut off and his
spinal column torn from the body.

467
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,640
A fitting demise to the Prince of Powder.

468
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:44,397
First Danny, then King Willie.
And you were right there!

469
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:47,734
He's playing with you, Mike.
You've gotta be careful.

470
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,780
Yeah. We all gotta be careful.
What about Keyes? Anything there?

471
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:54,908
Definitely something slippery about Keyes.

472
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:59,746
Seems there's a Peter J Keyes.
PhD physical sciences, Cornell.

473
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:04,501
Hot out of college
and into the Strategic Defense lnstitute.

474
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:08,672
Then two years later commissioned
as a captain in Air Force lntelligence.

475
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,508
Mike, this is a dead end.
We're way out of our league!

476
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,052
Look, l don't care who's involved.

477
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,514
This guy killed Danny
and he's going to fall!

478
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:20,684
- What about the good doctor?
- l'm here, Lieutenant.

479
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:25,355
The federal authorities erased everything
from the computer file except for this:

480
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:30,276
part of a chemical test on a
fragment of wood from the penthouse.

481
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:36,241
And it contained traces of
cattle blood and heavy traces of steroids.

482
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:39,202
l believe
whoever killed Detective Archuleta

483
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,996
had recently been in a slaughterhouse.

484
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:46,918
- That's where l lost Keyes the first time!
- That's where we'll find him.

485
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,714
Take the metro. l'll pick you up
at Vernon station in an hour.

486
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,800
Just because you don't see Keyes's boys
doesn't mean they're not around.

487
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,783
l just want you to stay in the car. OK?
Your mom and l won't be very long.

488
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:21,911
You sit still.
We'll be back in a few minutes.

489
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,414
All right?

490
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,833
- Come on, honey.
- Yes, darling.

491
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,627
- Which way was it?
- Down here.

492
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,843
Take that, you scum-sucking dog.

493
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,118
Want some candy?

494
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:05,914
Brian?

495
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:11,628
- You come here right this minute!
- Mommy, l saw a ghost.

496
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,379
Want some candy?

497
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,649
Rest.

498
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,657
Want some candy?

499
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,801
Danny's necklace.

500
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,432
l hate the subway at rush hour.

501
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,559
lt's hard enough to find a seat,
and if you do,

502
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,896
someone's pissed in it
or thrown up over it.

503
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,607
This damn heat is killing me, man.

504
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,233
Hey, it's me!

505
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,527
- l look great!
- Oh, shut up.

506
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:01,487
No autographs, Pop.

507
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,781
- Look. There's two seats right there.
- Don't touch me!

508
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,325
Hey! Get off!

509
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,039
This shit never ends.

510
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,044
- After you.
- Asshole!

511
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:18,963
- Excuse me. Police business.
- Get out of my way!

512
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,384
Hey, baby. BÃ©same mucho. Come on!

513
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:32,101
You look like a sympathetic dude.
My... partner here needs an operation.

514
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:36,147
But we're a little short of cash,
if you know what l mean?

515
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,733
No need for that.

516
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,319
- Money!
- Get the hell away from me!

517
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,237
l know how to use this!

518
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:47,116
- Don't make me use this thing!
- Bet mine's bigger than yours!

519
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:50,578
l'll take that.

520
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:53,957
- Hold it. Police!
- We're in trouble now.

521
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,668
- Nobody move!
- Alto, policia, no se muevan!

522
00:54:56,752 --> 00:55:00,296
Everybody take a deep breath,
loosen your sphincters.

523
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:02,423
We don't need
any rush-hour Rambos there.

524
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:07,178
Tu tambiÃ©n, motherfucking baby!
Drop it and sit down! SiÃ©ntate!

525
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:11,307
What the hell is that?

526
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,982
Leona, you OK?

527
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:23,069
This is it! He's in the train!
Get these people out of here!

528
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:29,993
Jerry! What's happening?

529
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:54,767
Get down! Get out of the way!

530
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:59,522
- Jerry!
- Leona!

531
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,774
Leona, get 'em out! Go!

532
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:07,780
Now!

533
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,305
Jerry!

534
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:36,934
Leona, do it! Now!

535
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:04,003
Hey! Over here!
Yeah, that's right. Come and get it.

536
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:13,346
Come on! Move it! Let's go! Vamos!

537
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:25,608
Move it! Don't panic, just go! Go! Vamos!

538
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,956
Jesus Christ. What the fuck are you?

539
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,333
Wait!

540
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,636
Vamos! Come on!

541
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:03,062
Keep walking! Come on, you too!
Vamonos!

542
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:07,900
- Come on, motherfucker!
- Want some candy?

543
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,402
Let's dance!

544
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:18,953
Come on, get out of the way!
Come on, out!

545
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,602
Come on, move it!

546
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:46,731
That way! Towards the light!

547
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,900
Come on! Get out!

548
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,796
Oh, God.

549
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,348
Jerry.

550
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,423
God, not again.

551
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:38,175
Move your ass! Move out the way!

552
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:44,682
- Watch out! What's happening?
- lt's a fucking slaughter, Lieutenant.

553
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:48,978
Hey, Jerry!

554
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:53,566
Leona! Oh, please. Leona...

555
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,279
- How's she doing?
- Deep shock, but she's alive.

556
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:05,244
l hear fetal heart sounds. She's pregnant.
Let's move. LA County. Stat!

557
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:12,793
Stand back.
On three. One, two, three. Load up.

558
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:17,173
Out of my way!
Move out the way! Move it!

559
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:18,507
Man!

560
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:37,735
Wait a minute. Let me see.

561
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:46,202
- Where's Jerry?
- l don't know.

562
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:49,872
We found his badge.

563
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,124
Who got hit this time?

564
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:57,838
Five gang members, bunch of commuters.
Doesn't make sense.

565
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,425
They were all armed.

566
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,595
- What do you mean?
- lt's the chief.

567
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:05,888
Wait here.

568
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,808
What the hell's going on down there?

569
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:10,726
lt's a damn nightmare. Civilians this time.

570
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:12,812
- All killed?
- Yeah. Just like the others.

571
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,814
Damn!

572
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,030
Jerry!

573
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:28,804
Holy shit! What the hell is going on here?

574
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:32,266
Hey, guys, get the camera on!
Get the camera on this right now!

575
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,810
Get that goddamn thing on film!

576
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:38,397
What's going on?

577
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:49,533
Hey, Harrigan!
More victims! More mutilations!

578
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:52,578
- Fuck you!
- Pope!

579
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,581
Pope? Are you there, Pope?
Pope, what's going on?

580
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:57,870
- Sir, the cop is back.
- Goddamn.

581
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:07,212
Harrigan! Don't you show up
in the damnedest places.

582
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:08,797
Come here, Lieutenant.

583
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,717
l got something
you might find interesting.

584
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,135
What is this?

585
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:17,973
How many times do l have to tell you?
You don't know what you're dealing with.

586
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:22,269
There's your killer. Wonderful, isn't it?

587
01:06:22,354 --> 01:06:27,608
Pheromone signature left by his body.
Scent molecules. Punch up three.

588
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:31,278
Ten years ago
one of his kind eliminated an

589
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:33,822
elite Special Forces crew
in Central America.

590
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:38,118
There were two survivors.
They indicated that, when trapped,

591
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,746
the creature activated
a self-destruct device

592
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:45,167
that destroyed enough rainforest
to cover 300 city blocks.

593
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:50,631
Remarkable weaponry. That's right,
Lieutenant. Other-world life forms.

594
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,259
A fucking alien!

595
01:06:56,012 --> 01:07:01,016
lwo Jima, Cambodia, Beirut.
Drawn by heat and conflict.

596
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:07,940
He's on safari.
Lions. The tigers. The bears. Oh, my!

597
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,818
Trophies. That's the game, isn't it, Keyes?

598
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:15,280
You're the lion. This is his jungle.

599
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:18,575
- So why can't we see him?
- Defensive adaptations are astounding.

600
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:22,496
lt's somehow able to bend light.
Perfect camouflage.

601
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,708
- You admire the son of a bitch.
- Not what he does.

602
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:32,089
For what he is. For what he can give us.
A new era of scientific technology.

603
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:36,051
l've waited a lifetime for this,
and l'm not going to miss the chance.

604
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:40,472
We have something
on the pheromone scanners.

605
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:48,939
Target one is on the roof.

606
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:52,526
lt's taken us two weeks
to learn his patterns.

607
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,987
He comes here every two days to feed.

608
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:59,074
- Seems he has a taste for beef.
- l didn't think he was vegetarian.

609
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:02,035
Well, we've prepared a trap
for this predator.

610
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,998
We are certain that this being
can see in only one spectrum of light -

611
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,584
- ..infrared.
- lnfrared?

612
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:12,588
- He hunts by seeing our heat.
- Block the heat and he's blind.

613
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:15,924
These suits insulate body heat,
making the team invisible.

614
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:18,343
We've flooded the place
with radioactive dust

615
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:22,431
and installed powerful
ultraviolet lighting everywhere.

616
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:26,351
The dust adheres to his body,
making him visible.

617
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:30,522
Liquid nitrogen. You're not gonna kill him.
You're gonna freeze him.

618
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:33,734
- We have to capture him.
- He's moving.

619
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,360
Finally.

620
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:40,449
Grab a seat. Enjoy the show.
This is history.

621
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:59,843
Capture and isolation is our objective.
Defensive action only on my orders.

622
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:05,098
Power up. Lights on. Let's get him!

623
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:22,157
We're in. Switch to ultraviolet.

624
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:26,537
- Radio silence. Out.
- Engage ultraviolet units A through J.

625
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:55,065
- What's all this interference?
- Correcting the problem, sir.

626
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,766
They're moving to the second level.

627
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,603
Target's still moving, heading towards
the number two stairwell.

628
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,148
Playing right into it.

629
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:36,500
Wait a minute. lt's stopped.

630
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,550
lt's moving back against the wall.

631
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:11,261
lt's backing up.
lt's moving away from them.

632
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:13,221
Your boys have been made.

633
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:18,351
- Sir, it's circling around behind them.
- Get 'em out! They're walking into a trap!

634
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:23,231
Keyes, he's behind you.
Third floor structure. Right there!

635
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:25,734
Who is this? Clear the line.

636
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,946
He sees the damn lights.
Turn 'em off! Shit!

637
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:31,823
Stop him!

638
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:41,166
- Door. Open it.
- Go fuck yourself.

639
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:45,087
- OK. OK.
- The door.

640
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:48,757
- Yes, sir.
- You don't know what you're doing.

641
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,426
- lt's open.
- You'll ruin everything!

642
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:53,011
Fuck yourself!

643
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:57,933
Defensive formation one.
Nitrogen guns, safeties off.

644
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:01,311
Everyone else, rock'n'roll. This is it.

645
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:18,328
- He's moving down from the right.
- Garber, where is he? l can't see him.

646
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,081
He's right there!

647
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:25,377
Goddamn it! Where is he?
Well, give me a coordinate! Where is he?

648
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,756
- Watch out!
- My God.

649
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:32,717
Watch your crossfire!

650
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,812
l'm losing my pressure.

651
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,674
Keyes, you all right?

652
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:14,718
Keyes, it's over here!

653
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:32,110
Come on! Switch over! Shit! l can't see!

654
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,617
They're gone.

655
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,620
They're all dead.

656
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,924
You want me? Here l am!

657
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:34,370
You are one

658
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:35,830
ugly mother...

659
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:40,168
Motherfucker!

660
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,333
Guess who's back.

661
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,213
Too late to go home now.

662
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:43,064
Get out of here, Harrigan.
l'm gonna save your ass.

663
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,233
This is between me and him!

664
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,867
God...

665
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:34,425
Birds.

666
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:37,428
Damn birds.

667
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,543
OK, pussyface.

668
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:52,587
lt's your move.

669
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:55,465
Shit happens.

670
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,274
Oh, God.

671
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:42,488
That's all l need is birds.

672
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:44,073
You can do it.

673
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:49,912
l can do it.

674
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:53,416
lt's like falling off a log.

675
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:08,806
Like a 30-story log. Damn!

676
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,452
Maybe l'll get lucky and fall.

677
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:11,869
Damn it.

678
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,973
The final Jeopardy answer is this:

679
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:37,019
Berengaria, who never set foot in England,
was its queen for eight years

680
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:42,233
after marrying this king on Cyprus.
Good luck.

681
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,860
Herb?

682
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:48,572
Herb, wake up!
There's somebody in the bathroom.

683
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:17,995
- lt's all right. l'm a cop.
- l don't think he gives a shit.

684
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,541
Shit!

685
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:24,210
Get back inside!

686
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:34,804
Holy Moses. Not again. Shit!

687
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:37,723
Son of a bitch.

688
01:30:39,226 --> 01:30:40,476
Oh, God.

689
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:48,776
Why can't this guy stay on the ground?

690
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:55,032
Come on, come on. Come to Papa.

691
01:31:01,832 --> 01:31:05,584
Stop! Stop the elevator!

692
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:06,877
Stop it!

693
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:38,909
Now where the hell am l?

694
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:57,595
Where are you?

695
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:54,985
Jesus Christ.

696
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:11,246
That's right, asshole!

697
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:13,123
Shit happens!

698
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:58,395
OK. Who's next?

699
01:37:45,485 --> 01:37:47,236
Take it.

700
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,825
"1 71 5."

701
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:50,252
Harrigan!
What the fuck happened in there?

702
01:40:58,052 --> 01:41:00,345
Goddamn it. We came so close!

703
01:41:09,731 --> 01:41:14,317
Don't worry, asshole.
You'll get another chance.
