2
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:26,150
Dad. Hey, Dad. Time to wake up.

3
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,527
Dad.

4
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:30,321
Where's the button on that snooze alarm?

5
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:32,023
Is that it? Where is it?

6
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:34,942
I'm not the snooze alarm.

7
00:01:35,343 --> 00:01:38,496
Are you excited?
It's time to go ice fishing.

8
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:39,747
I am excited.

9
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:43,618
I'm gonna sleep on it, figure out
what we're gonna do with it.

10
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,424
Remember? The early bird gets the worm.

11
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:52,427
And I think we know what
happens to that worm.

12
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:55,505
It gets gobbled up and eaten.

13
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:59,801
- Don't make me.
- All right, then.

14
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:05,765
All right. Now you've done it.
You know what you just did?

15
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:11,229
You just awakened the giant abominable yeti.
And you know what he feeds on?

16
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:13,364
- Cookies?
- No.

17
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:17,151
He feeds on tickles.

18
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:23,241
They feed on tickles.
Come on, then. Let's go fishing.

19
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:38,848
<i>Mele Kalikimaka
Is the thing to say</i>

20
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:42,135
<i>On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day</i>

21
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:43,811
My turn.

22
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:47,774
<i>That's the island greeting
That we send to you</i>

23
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:52,737
<i>From the land where palm trees sway</i>

24
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:56,658
<i>Here we know that Christmas
Will be green and bright</i>

25
00:02:56,758 --> 00:03:01,120
<i>The sun will shine all day
And all the stars at night</i>

26
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,500
<i>Mele Kalikimaka Is Hawaii's way</i>

27
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,254
<i>To say merry Christmas to you</i>

28
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:11,914
Take it away, Dad.

29
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:31,025
Dad, I wish you could've
been at Mommy's wedding.

30
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:35,897
You should've seen Mom's engagement ring.
The diamond was huge.

31
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:39,867
And during the wedding,
I got to hand Mom her ring.

32
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:43,538
I know, and you've been telling
me all week. That's awesome.

33
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:46,499
If your Mommy's happy, I'm super happy.

34
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,043
Yeah, she's super happy.

35
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:51,746
And Victor is awesome, don't you think?

36
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,883
Yeah, he's awesome. Hey,
you wanna know what else is awesome?

37
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:59,253
- Yeah.
- Watch this. What am I?

38
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:02,882
A walrus with tooth decay?

39
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:08,396
Walrus with tooth decay. You're funny.
Hey, you want a Kiddie Doodle?

40
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:10,064
For breakfast?

41
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:12,775
No, not for breakfast.
You don't eat that for breakfast.

42
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,602
You eat a Twinkie for breakfast.

43
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:19,899
What's wrong? What's wrong?
It's a Twinkie.

44
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:25,780
Hey, Dad? How come you and
Mom didn't stay married?

45
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:31,002
Well, sweetie, I still love
your mom and everything...

46
00:04:31,102 --> 00:04:32,378
and we're good friends.

47
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:33,588
I know.

48
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:36,382
You know, she likes classical
music and petits fours...

49
00:04:36,482 --> 00:04:39,427
and I like ice fishing
and Twinkies and....

50
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:42,847
Plus, she's real organized
and ambitious and driven...

51
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:46,634
and, well, I'm me.

52
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:48,728
I like ice fishing...

53
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:54,267
and Twinkies and classical
music and petits fours.

54
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:59,155
I know. And that's why
you're my little girl.

55
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:00,782
- I think I got one.
- No way.

56
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:03,910
Are you kidding? I haven't caught
anything here in six years.

57
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,862
Look, there it is.

58
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:18,424
Well, here we are. Victor's place.

59
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:21,511
Wow, I can't believe
I'm going to live here.

60
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:23,763
It's like a palace.

61
00:05:23,863 --> 00:05:27,058
Hey, I guess that makes me a princess.

62
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:30,136
Yeah, well, looks like
that makes me the troll.

63
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:35,275
Hurry, Victor. They're here.

64
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,570
- Hey, there she is.
- Mommy! Welcome home!

65
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,239
- I missed you.
- Look at you. You look bigger.

66
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,283
- Mommy and Victor.
- What's up, tiger?

67
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:44,525
Hi, Victor.

68
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:48,780
- Hey, buddy.
- Well. Hey, welcome home.

69
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:51,866
- Hi, Larry.
- Hey.

70
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:56,087
- Did you two have a good time together?
- Of course. Look at her. She's a princess.

71
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:58,464
- We had fun, didn't we?
- We had tons of fun.

72
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:03,011
We went skating, we went sledding,
we played hockey...

73
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:06,139
and today we went ice fishing.

74
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:08,266
- Ice fishing? How outdoorsy.
- Yeah.

75
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:12,437
- And I caught a fish. Show him, Daddy.
- Sure did. Look, that's a trout.

76
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:14,230
Look at that. Look how fat that is.

77
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,482
- That's a big one.
- Might even be pregnant.

78
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:19,777
- How was the honeymoon?
- Fantastic.

79
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:23,856
A week in Saint Croix,
another sailing around the islands.

80
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,983
Victor has his own boat.

81
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,621
So I guess it was your
second-best honeymoon.

82
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:33,407
I think you forget ours, huh?
Sizzler and a movie.

83
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:37,295
- That was some good steak.
- Yes. That's the big time.

84
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:40,715
Well, I'm not gonna brag about it.
Congratulations, Vic.

85
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:42,008
Thank you.

86
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:46,888
Now when she refers to her idiot husband,
she'll be talking about you instead of me.

87
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:48,506
Larry.

88
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:52,602
You just getting going on
your decorations? Little late.

89
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:55,396
Well, Trish told me how
much Noel loves Christmas.

90
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:57,807
I love it.

91
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,436
- You may have gone a little overboard.
- No.

92
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:06,399
So, what do you think?

93
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:10,903
- It's so pretty.
- Anything for you, sugarplum.

94
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:14,615
It's our first Christmas together.
I wanted it to be a memorable one.

95
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:19,579
- Sugar cookies.
- Oh, after you wash your hands.

96
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:23,132
Yeah, you gotta get that
fish smell off of there.

97
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:26,288
- Larry, how about a cup of coffee?
- Hey, I could go for that.

98
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:27,728
I'd love it. Love coffee.

99
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:31,090
- Victor, how about I take that?
- Please. Thank you.

100
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:39,524
- So how's the business?
- How's business?

101
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:40,858
- You go first.
- You do it.

102
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,312
How's the trucking business?
Part-time, right?

103
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:47,365
Well, yeah, it's part-time.
But see, that's how I like it.

104
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:49,200
Part-time is good.

105
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,280
That gives me more time to
spend with my daughter.

106
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:59,961
So how's the cardboard-box
business treating you?

107
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:01,170
Great.

108
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,965
Baxter Box Company is up
20 percent this year.

109
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,592
Online sales are booming.

110
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:07,594
I mean, all those packages...

111
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:10,588
- Are you kidding me?
- ...have to be shipped somewhere right?

112
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:15,968
My grandfather would be proud. Yup.
I built Baxter Box into an empire.

113
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,907
What's this little deal right here?
That little box.

114
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:21,966
What, do you add water,
and it get bigger?

115
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:27,438
It's a little something I had made for the
holidays to give the workers at the company.

116
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:29,824
You know what? Take it.
It's my gift to you.

117
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:32,318
- Really?
- Yeah.

118
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:37,290
It's for decoration.
You can display it on your desk.

119
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,784
Well, I don't got a desk.

120
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:48,760
- Coffee's ready.
- Oh, yes.

121
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,339
Yeah, boy, I'll tell you what, I could go
for a steaming cup of joe about right now.

122
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,266
She goes back to school January 5th.

123
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:59,354
So for the rest of Noel's vacation,
we'll just alternate days, as always...

124
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:02,065
with me and Victor getting
Christmas Eve this year...

125
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:03,983
and you getting Christmas Day.

126
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:08,446
- Yeah, that sounds good. I'm in.
- That's... Wait. He gets Christmas Day?

127
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:10,573
- Yeah.
- Well, we switch off every year.

128
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:12,867
- Alternate.
- This year it's Larry's turn.

129
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,077
I understand that.

130
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:17,455
It's just, you know, it's our
first Christmas as a family.

131
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:20,041
I just thought we'd
be together. First one.

132
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:21,459
- Ever.
- Vic. Vic.

133
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:24,712
I get her one year, you get the
next year. That's how it operates.

134
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:28,132
Of course. I just...
It's Christmas Day, you know?

135
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:30,751
Christmas morning.
The presents under the tree.

136
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,139
Opening gifts. The Christmas
dinner with all the trimmings.

137
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:38,059
I got trimmings.
I make delicious trimmings.

138
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,511
Why can't I just do both?

139
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:45,349
Spend half of Christmas with Dad
and then go to Mom and Victor's.

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,394
That's a great idea.

141
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:52,365
Come on, Dad. Please, Dad?

142
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:56,244
Please?

143
00:09:56,344 --> 00:09:59,831
All right. We'll think of something.
Al right? We'll figure it out.

144
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:03,576
- Go play.
- I get two Christmases.

145
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,425
<i>Sorry, Larry.</i>

146
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:12,885
Victor's just so excited
about being a stepdad.

147
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:15,471
He wants to spend as much
time as possible with Noel.

148
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:19,267
Well, what's done is done.

149
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:23,062
I'll tell you what. We'll go ahead and
have Christmas number one at my house.

150
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:26,649
Then I'll bring her over here, and you
guys can have Christmas number two.

151
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:28,276
Thanks, Larry.

152
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:31,988
And I'll talk to Victor about how to
handle these things in the future.

153
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:34,115
- All right.
- Dad, wait!

154
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:38,152
- Victor's gonna put on the Christmas lights.
- You ready? Come on. Honey, let's go.

155
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:39,746
Here we go. Ready?

156
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:43,574
One, two, three.

157
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:50,081
Oh, Victor, that's amazing.

158
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,968
Dad, have you ever seen
something so beautiful?

159
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:57,597
Yeah, it's something, all right.
It is something, that's for sure.

160
00:10:57,697 --> 00:11:02,760
This is going to be the
best Christmas ever!

161
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:08,399
- See y'all later.
- Good night, Daddy.

162
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:09,817
Good night, darling.

163
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:13,146
Hey, Ben Franklin. You got a bulb out.

164
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:17,525
It's all right, honey. You did good.

165
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:29,846
No way. He actually called
her "my little sugarplum"?

166
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:32,431
Yeah. I was standing right there.

167
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:37,679
Even I know that's a violation
of daddy-stepdaddy protocol.

168
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,473
You gonna kick his butt,
like you did Kip Kornhausen?

169
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:44,269
Kip Kornhausen? Oh, man.
Bud, that was in third grade.

170
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:47,555
I'm not gonna kick his butt.
I'm gonna teach him a lesson, though.

171
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:53,019
When it comes to Christmas spirit,
I'm fit to be Victor's worst nightmare.

172
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:57,699
<i>But the toy every little girl
and boy wants for Christmas...</i>

173
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,826
<i>is Harrison the Talking Bear.</i>

174
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:01,035
Check this out.

175
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:02,996
<i>Using a sophisticated computer chip...</i>

176
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:07,575
<i>Harrison can learn up to 300 words,
including a child's name.</i>

177
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:10,670
<i>Hi, I'm Harrison.</i>

178
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,214
<i>- What's your name?</i>
- Margo.

179
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:18,136
Nice to meet you, Margo.
Let's be friends.

180
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:21,147
<i>Well, if you want one in time
for Christmas, you'd better hurry.</i>

181
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:26,144
<i>- Supplies are limited and not expected...</i>
- I wish I had one of those when I was a kid.

182
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:27,937
- Order up.
- There it is right there.

183
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:31,524
Christmas lights,
a hundred foot for $32.99.

184
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:34,360
So if I wanna get as
many as Victor's got....

185
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,605
Let's see. That's gonna run me about...

186
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:40,742
a liver and two kidneys.

187
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:42,201
Oh, boy.

188
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:44,495
He's gonna have a winter
wonderland over there.

189
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:48,249
And I can't really compete with his wallet,
so I'm gonna have to use my head.

190
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:50,835
I'll take the wallet,
first-round knockout.

191
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:54,789
- Thanks for the vote of confidence there.
- It's on the house, Larry.

192
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:01,462
Wait a minute. I got a
great idea. Come on.

193
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,602
Well, that about does it.

194
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:10,855
We're all done. That's it.
That's the last part.

195
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:14,484
You know, using these used
car parts, Larry, was a great idea.

196
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:17,070
- This is gonna look amazing.
- Darn right it will.

197
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,656
Victor can put that in
his wallet and sit on it.

198
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:24,035
You're not gonna find better Christmas lights
than that anywhere, not even at Kmart.

199
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:26,779
- Speaking of the devil.
- Well, lookie here.

200
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:30,992
This is gonna be fun.

201
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,128
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey.

202
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:35,413
What's this?

203
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:41,135
Looks like you're using a
lot of electricity, Larry.

204
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:44,472
- You sure this thing is safe?
- Of course it is. I rigged it myself.

205
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:47,467
Obviously it's safe. All right.

206
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:50,261
Oh, for Pete's sake.

207
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:53,564
Claude, would you get up here?

208
00:13:53,664 --> 00:13:55,108
All right.

209
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,986
In honor of Christmas and Noel...

210
00:13:58,086 --> 00:13:59,946
I bring to everybody...

211
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:03,324
Larry's spectacular parade of lights.

212
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:04,984
Music please, Claude.

213
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:10,698
All right.

214
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:19,173
That ought to be in some kind of a
home-and-garden magazine right there.

215
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:21,334
That's unbelievable.

216
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:34,814
What do you think of that, sweetheart?

217
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:36,849
- It's awesome.
- It's glorious.

218
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:40,895
And now I present to
you the grand finale.

219
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:45,483
As they say in France,
the piece of the resistance.

220
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,825
Daddy!

221
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:56,494
- Daddy?
- Larry, are you okay?

222
00:14:58,312 --> 00:15:00,039
Am I in heaven?

223
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:04,752
Hi, Victor.

224
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:10,183
Sorry there was a power outage last night so
we couldn't make pancakes this morning...

225
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:12,393
or bake Christmas cookies last night.

226
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:15,012
It's okay. I can bake
cookies with Chef Philippe.

227
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:16,931
Who's Chef Philippe?

228
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:19,225
- He's Victor's chef.
- Chef?

229
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:23,404
I'll bet Victor's chef ain't got Fruity
Pebbles. How's them Fruity Pebbles?

230
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:24,822
Delish.

231
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:26,741
That's right. They're delicious.

232
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:31,037
Dad, I think we need a new holiday tree.

233
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:34,624
What's wrong with that one? That's one
of them little Charlie Brown trees.

234
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:36,576
He's so cute.

235
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:41,205
I like the smell of Mommy
and Victor's better.

236
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:47,336
And it doesn't have
enough room for presents.

237
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:52,383
Why don't you and me go shopping
for a big old Christmas tree?

238
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,760
Cool beans!

239
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,313
Can I have this one?

240
00:15:57,413 --> 00:16:00,942
It's almost as big as the one that
Mommy and Victor have at their house.

241
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:04,445
Yeah, but, honey, that thing's $300.
I mean, that's crazy.

242
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:08,357
For $300 it ought to already
have presents underneath it.

243
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:11,953
Sugar, picking a Christmas tree
is like picking a boyfriend.

244
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:14,414
Trust me. You can't just
settle on the first one.

245
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:17,250
Or the second one or the third
or the fourth or the fifth.

246
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,879
Okay, I get it, Dad.
Hey, can I get apple cider?

247
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:24,924
I'll tell you what, that's the
best idea I've heard all day.

248
00:16:25,024 --> 00:16:28,052
Here you go.
Get me one if it's not $300.

249
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:29,420
Okay.

250
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,844
So you like what you see?

251
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:41,599
I plead the Fifth.

252
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,111
- Well, we have a wide variety of trees here.
- I see.

253
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:47,530
If you want a fir tree,
we've got Douglas fir...

254
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,159
we've got noble fir, we've got
concolor fir, we've got Canaan fir.

255
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:56,122
- Hey, you look more like a pine guy to me.
- Do I look like a pine guy?

256
00:16:56,222 --> 00:17:01,002
Here I thought I was more of a concolor.
Boy, all these years I've been living a lie.

257
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:03,922
Well, we have white pine,
Virginia pine and Scotch pine.

258
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:08,509
- So, what's your pleasure?
- I want something very special and cheap.

259
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,877
- Special and cheap?
- Yeah.

260
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:13,932
Well, the ones that are cheaper
tend to be on the more sparse side.

261
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:17,435
- But you can cover it up if you flock it.
- Flock?

262
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:20,012
This one right here is only $165.

263
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:22,357
Hundred and sixty-five dollars.

264
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:25,276
- How much is the flocking?
- Oh, the flocking's free.

265
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:28,488
You know what?
I'll just take the flocking.

266
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:32,233
You could go for this guy over here.
He might be more in your price range.

267
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,204
What in tarnation is that thing?

268
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:41,542
That is a special-order 50-foot
Norway spruce shipped from Maine.

269
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:44,754
- Fifty-foot.
- It costs $10,000.

270
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:47,048
Ten thousand dollars.

271
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:50,918
What kind of blockhead buys a
Christmas tree for $10,000?

272
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:55,256
- Okay. Yeah, yeah. That's great.
- Never mind.

273
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,768
Can you give me a second?
I wanna check that tree out.

274
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:01,387
- Sure.
- That's something else.

275
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:07,268
You couldn't find anything bigger?
Just kidding. Thank you very much.

276
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,779
It's fantastic.

277
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:11,272
Hey, Trish.

278
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:15,577
Oh, it's perfect. Noel's gonna love it.
It's gonna be the best tree lighting ever.

279
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:19,414
Victor, I get that Baxter Box always hosts
the town's tree-lighting ceremony...

280
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:23,042
but do you really have to buy
the town a $10,000 tree?

281
00:18:23,142 --> 00:18:24,877
Are you trying to run for mayor?

282
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:28,756
No, no, hon. I'm just trying to buy
some goodwill and affection here.

283
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:32,927
I just figure the bigger the tree,
the more the affection, right?

284
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:35,340
Oh, so he's trying to buy Noel's love.

285
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,016
My little girl's love ain't
for sale for anybody.

286
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,225
Sorry.

287
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:44,639
Hey! No, I'm in here!
Turn it off! I can't see!

288
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,276
Turn it off! Somebody
turn that machine off!

289
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:50,645
I can't... I can't...

290
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:58,820
Dad. What happened?

291
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:02,740
I hope somebody got the
license plate of that pigeon.

292
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:07,787
You wanna have a snowball fight?
Come on.

293
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:21,676
You missed me.

294
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,928
No, no, no.

295
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:27,515
You have got a really good arm.

296
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,189
Gotcha. Oh, she's charging.

297
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:38,151
No! Okay, this is war.

298
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:41,988
- Way to go.
- You missed me.

299
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:50,463
I'm gonna feel this in the morning.

300
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:53,291
How are you even doing that?

301
00:19:56,944 --> 00:19:59,681
I hit you a hundred times.

302
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:03,217
I got you a million and 98.

303
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,485
- You two have fun?
- We had tons of fun.

304
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:10,608
I totally nailed Victor.

305
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,151
- She did.
- Good for you.

306
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:14,988
Well, your lunch is ready
for you in the kitchen.

307
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,449
And remember, we're dropping
you off at your dad's at 3.

308
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:21,536
We have enough time for another
snowball fight after lunch.

309
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:22,862
Right, Victor?

310
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,240
You wouldn't be interested
in peace talks, would you?

311
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:29,711
Not a chance.

312
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,079
I had a lot of fun with you, Victor.

313
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,418
Me too.

314
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:41,088
You're almost as much fun as my dad.

315
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:48,054
Almost as much fun as Larry.

316
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,935
I can't compete with that guy.

317
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,408
Skating, sledding, hockey, ice fishing.

318
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:03,036
He's like a big squishy teddy bear.

319
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:07,498
This isn't a competition, Victor.
You're Noel's dad too.

320
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:11,377
Dad Number 2. Second best. Runner-up.

321
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:13,663
A substitute.

322
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:17,416
Not the real thing but
a startling simulation.

323
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,220
"Dad too," as in "dad also."

324
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,299
Your job is to be there
for Noel, same as Larry.

325
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:28,052
That's all that matters.

326
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:30,346
Okay?

327
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,653
Okay?

328
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,771
Teddy bear.

329
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:44,202
I'm telling you, Claude...

330
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:47,622
Victor may have a snow machine,
but Noel is gonna love this.

331
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:51,951
- Larry, this is crazy.
- Yeah, but it's the real-good kind of crazy.

332
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:55,788
Who needs a snow machine
when you've got real snow?

333
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:59,667
Go like this. It's better on your back.

334
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,936
- When is he gonna be here?
- I'm sure he'll be here soon, honey.

335
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:11,679
Hopefully in the next year.

336
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,232
That's Larry.

337
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:16,100
There he is.

338
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:21,397
- Hey.
- Hey. He's here.

339
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:27,862
- Hi, Daddy.
- Where's my little girl?

340
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:33,334
Oh, good. Oh, you're getting big.

341
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:36,129
We've been waiting for a half hour.
Where have you been?

342
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:40,091
- I got a surprise for Noel.
- A surprise? What is it? What is it?

343
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:43,136
How would you like to have
some real snow at Christmas?

344
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:47,473
- We already have snow at Victor's.
- I know, but that's that fake stuff.

345
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:50,393
I mean real snow. This come out
of the sky and everything.

346
00:22:50,493 --> 00:22:54,022
It's real snow, not that synthetic
man-made polyester stuff...

347
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,732
that you've got at your house.

348
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,860
- This is real.
- That would be awesome.

349
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,863
- Darn right it would be.
- Let's show these nonbelievers, Lar.

350
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,700
Oh, boy. It's gonna be exciting.
This is the best idea I ever had.

351
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,735
Get ready to be bowled over.

352
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,745
- Anybody got a towel?
- Daddy?

353
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:23,176
- You know what that is?
- No.

354
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,752
It's a tickle monster.

355
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:28,014
It's a tickle monster.

356
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:31,300
All right, you goof, time for bed.

357
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:35,229
Good night, Dad. Thanks for the snow.

358
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:39,567
I really liked it, even though
it was melted and everything.

359
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:42,687
Sweetie, that's nice of you.
I appreciate it.

360
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,742
Listen, I love you. Good night. Now,
you have a good night's sleep, okay?

361
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:50,945
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, sweetie.

362
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:03,508
I don't know, Claude.
I just can't catch a break.

363
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,511
I don't know how I can
compete with Victor.

364
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,638
It's tough. I'll give you that.

365
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,975
He's younger, richer, more educated.

366
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,978
He's in great shape and much,
much, much better-looking.

367
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,472
All right. I get the point.

368
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:19,649
But the more important question is...

369
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,151
why do you feel the need
to compete with Victor?

370
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:26,739
Noel doesn't care about that stuff.
She loves you for you, Larry.

371
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,065
I am pretty lovable.

372
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,944
Good night, Larry.

373
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,281
See you later, Claude.

374
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:46,092
- Is my angel ready to order?
- I sure am.

375
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:49,504
- I was referring to the little angel.
- Oh, sorry.

376
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,390
My usual, Maggie, please.

377
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,468
PB & J, light on the
PB and heavy on the J.

378
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,639
- Correct.
- I'll have the same thing I always have too.

379
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,350
Deep-fried everything, hold the salad.

380
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:06,738
I tell you what, Maggie,
you know me pretty good.

381
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,357
I got your number, Larry.

382
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,121
So, what you working on there?
Your homework?

383
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:16,748
My letter to Santa.

384
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,700
Letter to Santa? I thought
you got that done July 4th.

385
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,339
There's something special I want.

386
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:28,593
- What is it?
- I can't tell you or anyone else.

387
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:33,348
If I do, it won't come true.
It's like making a wish.

388
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,893
No, no, no. Don't worry.
I'm not gonna ruin that.

389
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,220
But, hey, can you give me a little hint?

390
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,815
I'm asking Santa...

391
00:25:42,915 --> 00:25:50,022
for the one thing I want more
than anything in the world.

392
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:55,203
Well, hey, I got an idea.
There's a mailbox right over there.

393
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:59,666
Why don't you give me the letter,
and then I'll run it out there?

394
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,034
Would you, Daddy? Thank you so much.

395
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,621
You got it, squirt. I'll be right back.

396
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:16,391
Hey, Larry.

397
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,060
- Hey, Claude, what's going on?
- What you up to?

398
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,396
Noel's letter to Santa Claus.

399
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,932
I figure what Victor can do
in quantity, I can do in quality.

400
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:28,611
What? You're not thinking
of opening that, are you?

401
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:30,772
Yeah. Of course.

402
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:35,034
I mean, look, Victor can get a big old
tree and a bunch of fancy lights...

403
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:37,412
and a bunch of fake snow.

404
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,498
But when I see what she's got
in here, what she really wants...

405
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,083
I can give it to her.

406
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,411
That's a private letter,
not addressed to you.

407
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:48,206
Not to mention, that's a federal crime.

408
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:53,052
Claude, it's my daughter's
letter to Santa Claus.

409
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:54,796
I think we're gonna be fine.

410
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,266
That's just wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong.

411
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,269
And you see this? This is
my letter to Santa Claus.

412
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,939
If I find out you tampered with it,
you're gonna answer to me...

413
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,474
and Mr. Claus himself.

414
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,399
Boy, who pooped in his hashbrowns?

415
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,842
Boy, her handwriting's horrible.

416
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,677
Just like her daddy's.

417
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,981
"Dear Santa: For Christmas
I want my family to get...

418
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:50,184
her... Hera...

419
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,438
Herasone."

420
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,358
What the heck's a herasone?

421
00:27:57,508 --> 00:28:01,487
- Bye-bye, Daddy.
- See you later, sweetheart.

422
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:07,535
- So, what did you and Larry do today?
- Not much.

423
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:13,374
- More ice fishing?
- No. We just went to the diner.

424
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,628
- I wrote a letter to Santa.
- Let me guess.

425
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,798
Pixie and her Starburst Buddies.

426
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,643
Little Paris and her Magical Closet.

427
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,220
Those are little-kid toys.

428
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,691
Hold on. What...?

429
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,109
What did you ask Santa for?

430
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,696
I can't tell you, or else
I won't get what I want.

431
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,355
I didn't even tell Dad.

432
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:43,204
Well, you know, we should probably
mail those letters right away, so....

433
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,240
- You know, I could take it for you.
- Dad already did.

434
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,334
Did he?

435
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:52,038
He went right out of the diner
to mail it as soon as I wrote it.

436
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,542
Really?

437
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,546
Thanks. Excuse me.

438
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:05,518
Security. Welling here.

439
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,145
Welling.

440
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,263
I have an assignment for you.

441
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:15,028
Yes, sir.

442
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,480
It would be my pleasure, sir.

443
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,788
What are you up to, chubby?

444
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,266
Oh, hey. Hi, I'm Jeffrey.
Welcome to Toy Traders.

445
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,269
Merry Christmas, happy holidays,
happy Hanukkah...

446
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,230
happy Kwanzaa, and a very
happy winter solstice.

447
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,234
- I think you got all the bases covered.
- Thank you.

448
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:58,071
Listen. I'm looking for something,
but I don't quite know what I'm looking for.

449
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,814
Okay.

450
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,483
Herasone.

451
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:06,120
I'm sorry. I'm having a hard
time reading your handwriting.

452
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,915
That's not my handwriting.
It's my daughter's. She's 7.

453
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,993
- Mine's a lot worse, trust me.
- Oh, it is?

454
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,963
- Yeah.
- You have any of those?

455
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,299
Yeah. No clue. No idea, sir.

456
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,917
Oh, boy.

457
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,920
Wait a second.
Unless she means Harrison.

458
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:27,100
- What's a Harrison?
- Harrison the Talking Bear.

459
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,561
You're gonna love this. Follow me. Yes!

460
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:32,814
Harrison the Talking Bear.
Haven't you heard?

461
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:37,819
It's only the most popular toy amongst the
coveted 5-to-10-year-old age demographic.

462
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,606
So the bear learns the kids' names
and then says it back to them.

463
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,825
It's the hottest toy this season.

464
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,327
- Really? That bear?
- Oh, yeah. They love it.

465
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,289
- That's what kids are going nuts over.
- Nuts for the bear.

466
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,708
Well, all right. I guess
I'll get my daughter one.

467
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,710
Sorry, but we're all sold out.

468
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,589
These things keep flying off the
shelves as fast as we can stock them.

469
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,926
My daughter really wants one of these bears.
Think maybe you might have one in the back?

470
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,378
Sorry. But...

471
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:10,310
if you write your name and number down,
I will call you as soon as we get more in.

472
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,438
You think some other stores
might have one of these bears?

473
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,647
Maybe.

474
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:18,359
You'll have to try again tomorrow.
All the shops are closing up right now.

475
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:22,030
All right. Well, it looks like
tomorrow I'm going bear hunting.

476
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,115
Well, thanks for
shopping at Toy Traders.

477
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,868
Merry Christmas, happy holidays,
happy Hanukkah...

478
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,370
happy Kwanzaa, and a very
happy winter solstice.

479
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,540
- Okay. Merry Christmas in any language.
- Merry Christmas.

480
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,500
Hey. Hi, I'm Jeffrey.

481
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,328
Welcome to Toy Traders.
Can I help you out with anything?

482
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,341
A Harrison Talking Bear? Are you sure?

483
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,502
That's what he asked for.
Seemed really desperate to get it.

484
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,422
So Noel wants a Harrison Talking Bear.

485
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:52,226
And to your knowledge,
he hasn't found one yet?

486
00:31:52,326 --> 00:31:54,220
Nope. All the other stores are closed.

487
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,899
<i>Although he'll certainly be
out looking for one tomorrow.</i>

488
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,725
Good.

489
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,729
I have another assignment for you.

490
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,572
Five more minutes.
Give me five more minutes.

491
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,286
Eleven-thirty!

492
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,595
Open?

493
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,630
You have this, miss? Okay.

494
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,301
Thank you.

495
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,206
<i>Hi, I'm Harrison.</i>

496
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,856
Ring it up.

497
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,615
Let's load them up and move them out.

498
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,172
Oh, man.

499
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,642
Hi. Excuse me.

500
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,812
Hey.

501
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,943
Mine.

502
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,537
Yeah, I understand.

503
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,957
Let me ask you, are you gonna be
getting any more Harrison Bears in?

504
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,378
- Well, I'm glad it's so dad-gum funny.<i>
- You gotta be kidding me.</i>

505
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,138
Still no luck?

506
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,767
Nothing. I've tried every
toy store within 500 miles.

507
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,521
Waynesville, Morganton, Boone.
They're all sold out.

508
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:45,316
Well, what about online? eBay?

509
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,402
They've got rush delivery, right?

510
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,573
Soonest they can get it to me is the 26th.
I need it on Christmas, not the day after.

511
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:56,536
Well, I'm sure that she'll
love whatever you got her.

512
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,497
Well, that's the problem.

513
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,616
I didn't get her nothing yet.

514
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,753
- Planning ahead, I see.
- Maggie, it ain't easy.

515
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,839
Back in the day, when she was littler...

516
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:12,051
you know, I'd go into some toy store and
get her some kind of doll with pink on it...

517
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:16,055
or some kind of unicorn or a bunny
or something with a magic wand.

518
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:20,051
She's older now. It just doesn't work.
It's a lot harder.

519
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,304
I gotta get that bear.

520
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,361
This is Larry.

521
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,699
This is Jeffrey calling from Toy Traders.
You signed up for the Harrison wait list.

522
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,453
Well, I'm calling to tell you that we
have more Harrison Bears just arrived.

523
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:42,040
<i>They'll be available tomorrow morning
on a first-come, first-served basis.</i>

524
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,783
So get here early.

525
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,663
Oh, man. I don't believe it.
I got me a Harrison Bear.

526
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,134
Pie for everybody.

527
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,303
You're the only one here, Larry.

528
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,464
Well, I'll take theirs.

529
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,939
Hey, Mr. Welling?

530
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,816
Hi, this is Jeffrey
calling from Toy Traders.

531
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,945
Well, I'm calling to tell you
some really, really good news.

532
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,488
I see.

533
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,573
First-come, first-served.

534
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,692
What time do you open?

535
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,361
See you then.

536
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,374
I'm awake. I'm awake.

537
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,810
Yeah, you're a pretty good dad, Larry.

538
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,053
I'll bet Victor wouldn't
do this for Noel.

539
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,482
Oh, man.

540
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,609
You gotta be kidding me.

541
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,312
Hey, is everybody in this
line to buy a Harrison Bear?

542
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,106
That's right, friend.

543
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,445
- What some people won't do to get a toy?
- Yeah.

544
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,865
It's crazy.

545
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,080
How you doing?

546
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,091
Some bear.

547
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,335
No, no. I put one on hold.

548
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:24,017
Good morning, everyone. Thank you
for waiting outside all night long.

549
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,269
I am thrilled to let you know...

550
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:30,431
that we have a new shipment
of Harrison Bears.

551
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,529
Okay, one at a time. And slow down.

552
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,565
Take your time. There's no rush.

553
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,113
Where are these bears?

554
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,501
- What?
- There's nothing here.

555
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,046
- Where are all the bears?
- This can't be happening.

556
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:57,425
- Hey. Where are all the bears?
- Yeah. Where's the new shipment?

557
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,595
I'm sorry, everyone,
but the Harrison Bears have sold out.

558
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,888
- What?
- What?

559
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,048
Oh, come on.

560
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,684
Thank you for shopping at Toy Traders.

561
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,938
And have a very merry Christmas,
happy holidays, happy Hanukkah...

562
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:14,100
happy Kwanzaa, and a very
happy winter solstice.

563
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,529
- Them things sold out in five minutes?
- More like 30 seconds.

564
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,982
First customer just came
and bought them all.

565
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:25,328
- He bought every one of them bears?
- Yeah. All 50 of them.

566
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,955
I guess he's got a lot of kids.

567
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,708
Don't you got, like, some kind of
a one-per-family limit or something?

568
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,994
I told you it was first-come,
first-served.

569
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,455
Boy.

570
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,258
You know what? I hope you
have a sucky holiday...

571
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:43,671
a sucky Christmas, a sucky Hanukkah,
a sucky Kwanzaa, and a sucky winter salsa.

572
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:49,177
What are you looking at?
You started the whole thing.

573
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,145
Oh, okay.

574
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:54,524
It looks like someone's gonna get
coal in their stocking this year.

575
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:58,987
When the coal...
When the fairies put the coal and...

576
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,732
You'll just wish you had
something other than coal.

577
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:15,211
Hey. You're the guy at
the front of the line.

578
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,672
Are you the guy who's been
buying up these bears?

579
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,091
First-come, first-served.

580
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:24,378
- You got 50 of them. How many kids you got?
- I have a lot of nephews and nieces.

581
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,472
Hey, listen.

582
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,642
You think maybe you could
spare me one of them?

583
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,552
I mean, I'll give you $100.

584
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,606
A hundred bucks. One bear.

585
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,357
- Sorry.
- Oh, man, look, I'm des...

586
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,352
Man, I'm really desperate.
I'd love to have one of them...

587
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,905
Jeez.

588
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,114
Uncle.

589
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,490
If you'll excuse me...

590
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,944
I have a lot more holiday
shopping to attend to.

591
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,536
If I wasn't full of Christmas spirit,
I'd have knocked him out.

592
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:04,127
And you're certain there's not a single
Harrison Bear on any shelf in town?

593
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,089
Thank you, Welling.

594
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,928
Noel, your dad's here.

595
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,933
- Bye, sweet pea.
- Bye, Mom.

596
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,269
So how's everything, Larry?

597
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,655
Oh, awesome. Real good.
Couldn't be better.

598
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,074
- Doing any Christmas shopping?
- A little bit. You?

599
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:29,244
- No, no. I've got it wrapped up this year.
- Good.

600
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,872
In fact, I think this is gonna turn out
to be an extra-special Christmas...

601
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,450
for someone we both know.

602
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,785
You two have fun.

603
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,456
Come on, Dad.

604
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,432
Wow, this is looking really great.

605
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:56,095
- You're darn right it does. Look at it.
- Dad. You're eating all the shingles.

606
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,307
I know. It's pathetic, ain't it?

607
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,310
Here I thought I'd be
full after the chimney.

608
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,863
Don't worry, sweetheart.

609
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,492
I got enough shingles for
10,000 gingerbread houses.

610
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:14,706
Hey. I'll bet Victor doesn't have time to
make a gingerbread house with you like I do.

611
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,126
No. He's been awfully busy...

612
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:24,165
with some big project called
Operation Who's Your Daddy.

613
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:30,680
You didn't tell Victor what was in that
letter you wrote to Santa Claus, did you?

614
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,889
Oh, no, Dad.

615
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:36,644
I wouldn't do anything that might keep
me from getting what I asked for.

616
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,439
Boy, you really want
that thing, don't you?

617
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,140
Whatever it is.

618
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,194
Hey, sweetheart,
let me ask you something.

619
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,531
What if Santa Claus isn't able
to get you what you asked for?

620
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:52,952
Oh, no, Dad, don't even say that.
I know Santa will come through.

621
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,322
He just has to.

622
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:10,094
- You haven't even touched your pie.
- Oh, Maggie.

623
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,338
I ain't got much of an appetite.

624
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,433
I should take your pulse
to see if you're still alive.

625
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,770
It's that dad-gum stuffed bear.
It's stressing me out.

626
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,271
You haven't found one yet?

627
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,392
No. Those stuffed bears are rarer
than a cabdriver with fresh breath.

628
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,981
Hey. Maybe you should ask those
ladies where they got theirs.

629
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,117
- Hurry.
- That's a Harrison Bear.

630
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,194
I'll be right back.

631
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:42,201
Excuse me, ladies.
Excuse me, ladies. Hold on.

632
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,712
I'm desperate. It's about your bear.

633
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,839
- What about the bear?
- What about the bear?

634
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,633
I want it, and I was wondering if...

635
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:52,136
No. You're the fifth person in
the last hour to ask us about it.

636
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:56,474
- And we're telling you, it's not for sale.
- It's not for sale. At any price.

637
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,478
- No, I don't wanna buy it. I was just...
- Oh, so you just wanna take it?

638
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,565
Nobody takes this bear.
It's for our grandniece.

639
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,735
- No, no, I think you misunderstand me.
- We're warning you.

640
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,605
We've taken a senior-citizen
self-defense class.

641
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,523
Chop!

642
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,410
That'll teach you.

643
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,987
Don't mess with a senior.

644
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:22,166
There you go. The nerve.
Where's the spirit of Christmas?

645
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,869
Christmas is getting violent.

646
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,011
A Harrison Bear.

647
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,462
Roosters Tavern.

648
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:37,924
Reindeer Charity Fundraiser.

649
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,467
Yeah.

650
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:46,733
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to Roosters Tavern's...

651
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:51,312
annual Bucking Reindeer
Charity Fundraiser.

652
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,482
Hooray!

653
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:57,160
I'm not too crazy about this.

654
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:03,625
We have 10 very brave Santas up
here willing to risk life and limb...

655
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:05,460
- ...to raise money...
- Life and limb?

656
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,608
...for St. Lukes Children's
Hospital by trying to see how long

657
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:11,349
they can stay on Bucky.

658
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,285
I've never ridden a
mechanical reindeer before.

659
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:17,855
Neither have I. The way I figure,
with both of us riding,

660
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,934
it gives us a better chance to win
that Harrison Bear there for Noel.

661
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:27,515
And the Santa who stays on the
longest will win our grand prize.

662
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,611
- We got it. We got it.
- Better give up now, fellas.

663
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:35,782
My boy wants that bear for Christmas,
and I never let my boy down.

664
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:39,277
Well, my little girl wants it too,
and I never let my little girl down.

665
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,436
Let me tell you, it ain't
over till it's over.

666
00:44:42,536 --> 00:44:46,960
- Oh, it's over.
- Let the games begin.

667
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,003
- Santa Number 1.
- Victory!

668
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:53,341
That's Santa Number 1 up here?
Are you ready, Santa Number 1?

669
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,510
On your mark, get set...

670
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,671
let's ride.

671
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,522
He's holding on for dear life.
He's holding on.

672
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,190
Oh, he's off.

673
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,985
We've got his score. Seven seconds.

674
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:14,279
Not a bad start, Santa Number 1.

675
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,573
Well, let's get the second
Santa Claus up here.

676
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:18,157
- Let's go.
- Good luck, Claude.

677
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,119
You can do it, Claude.
Stay on her, buddy.

678
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:24,789
- Santa Number 2, are you ready?
- I'm... I'm ready.

679
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:28,159
Ready, set, let's ride.

680
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,381
That was interesting.

681
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:38,052
- How long did I go for?
- You were on for one second.

682
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,596
What?

683
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:41,889
One second, everybody.
Keep it going for Santa.

684
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,051
Santa Number 3. Let's ride.

685
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,602
And he's got nine seconds.

686
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,276
Let's ride.

687
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,114
Oh, man. Fall, fall, fall. Yes!

688
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,950
Go, go, go!

689
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:13,922
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah.

690
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:17,041
Santa Number 7, come on down.

691
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,962
Let's ride.

692
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,966
Number 7 is holding on.

693
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:31,305
Oh, my gosh. Look at this guy go.

694
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,226
Oh, he's still hanging on.
He's holding on for dear life.

695
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:38,863
He's still going. He's still...

696
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,782
You've gotta be kidding me.

697
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:44,402
Number 7, 22 seconds.

698
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,541
- You've done it, Number 7.
- What are you gonna do, Larry?

699
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:54,754
- You can't hold on for 23 seconds.
- I'm gonna get something out of my truck.

700
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:58,132
Let me tell you something. This glue
is gonna give me the edge I need.

701
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,219
- Do me a favor. Get my backside, would you?
- That's disgusting.

702
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,306
Would you just do my backside, dude?
Do you want Noel to win that bear or not?

703
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,267
Oh, yeah.

704
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:08,518
Do not forget...

705
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:13,848
you must get at least 23 seconds
on the bull to win the grand prize.

706
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:16,434
- Let's go, boss.
- Let's ride.

707
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:20,021
Come on, chubby man!

708
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,775
He's a tornado on
the back of a reindeer.

709
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:28,863
- How fast this thing go?
- All right, okay.

710
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,703
Do not let go. Do not let go.

711
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,005
Hang on, Larry!

712
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,719
Go! Go! Go!

713
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,781
He's done it, 31 seconds!

714
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,533
We've got a new champion!

715
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,494
- He did it!
- I won! I won!

716
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,538
In 31 seconds. Do you hear?

717
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,041
You have won yourself...

718
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:19,372
a weekend for two in the beautiful,
romantic Pocono Mountains.

719
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,716
- Pocono?
- All right.

720
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,052
No, no, no. I wanted the bear.

721
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:27,055
- I thought first prize was the bear.
- Sorry, but well done.

722
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:30,558
Now, in second place, Rider Number 7...

723
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,928
you have won Harrison the Talking Bear.

724
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:36,430
I won?

725
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,986
My boy's gonna have the
best Christmas ever.

726
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:44,572
Oh, yeah. Number 2!

727
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:47,567
Give it up for Number 2! Oh, yeah!

728
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:51,371
Now, what am I gonna do
with a trip to the Poconos?

729
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:53,164
I'll go with you.

730
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,533
Come on, Claude.

731
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,785
Boy, it's breezy in here.

732
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:02,757
I'll tell you, Claude, I don't know.
I know this, though.

733
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:08,004
At this rate, I'm never gonna
get one of them bears.

734
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:17,346
What is going on?

735
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:23,394
<i>Harrison loves to play.</i>

736
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:26,197
<i>That tickles.</i>

737
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:30,318
<i>I'm baby Harrison. Time for a nap.</i>

738
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,237
<i>Hi-hidey-ho, I'm Harrison.</i>

739
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:44,090
<i>This is fun. Harrison loves exercise.</i>

740
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,292
Where are all these bears coming from?

741
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:53,474
- Did you get any more talking bears in?
- Oh, hey. We certainly do.

742
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,561
Oh, man. Everybody's got
one but me. Can I have one?

743
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:58,646
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

744
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:01,983
<i>Hi, I'm Larry the Loser Bear.
Get her done.</i>

745
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,736
Hey, that ain't a Harrison Bear.
That's a me bear.

746
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:09,324
This is the second most popular toy amongst
the coveted 5-to-10-year-old age demographic.

747
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:11,826
Second most?
Well, what's the most popular?

748
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,578
This one.

749
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:16,364
<i>Hidey-ho, I'm Victor
the Talking Bear.</i>

750
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:20,993
<i>I'm the best dad ever, and I'll buy
whatever your little heart desires.</i>

751
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:27,550
I love that one. Every kid in
America wants one of these.

752
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,095
A Victor Bear. Daddy,
can I please have it?

753
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:36,008
That's the thing I want more
than anything for Christmas.

754
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,279
<i>I'm here at town hall, where they're setting
up a soup kitchen for the homeless.</i>

755
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:52,825
<i>As you can see, there are some wonderful toys
that will be handed out at noon today...</i>

756
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:57,321
<i>to needy boys and girls by
none other than Santa himself.</i>

757
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:02,293
<i>- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, Santa.</i>

758
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:05,296
<i>- I'm Margo Price, Channel One News.
- Thanks, Margo.</i>

759
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:07,257
Oh, man.

760
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:10,918
You cannot be thinking what
you're thinking right now.

761
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,306
Are you happy? I'm so glad you're happy.

762
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,066
No guilt, Larry. Come on.

763
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:39,205
Yeah, this $500 donation way
makes up for that bear.

764
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:40,907
All right.

765
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:45,044
- Larry? Larry Phillips?
- Yeah.

766
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:48,506
- Is that you?
- Oh, hey, Janie.

767
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,300
- How's tricks?
- Good, good.

768
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,961
I was just dropping off some presents
to donate for the charity event.

769
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:57,390
I haven't seen you since we
graduated from high school.

770
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,268
I know. It's been a long time.
All right, then.

771
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:05,231
Larry. Don't give up. You know,
it's bound to get better.

772
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:08,443
Oh, no, Janie, I'm doing fine, really.
These are...

773
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,528
These are just old clothes.
It's washday.

774
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,781
I hope this isn't because
I dumped you, Larry.

775
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,241
Well, hold on a second.

776
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,486
I kind of remember that differently.
It was kind of mutual.

777
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:23,958
Oh, I have to go to church.
But it was really good seeing you again.

778
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:27,211
- You too.
- I'm sure this is all a little rough patch.

779
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,498
You know? And I just
want you to be brave.

780
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:33,301
I don't need money, Janie.

781
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:37,221
Larry, there is no shame
in accepting help.

782
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,298
You poor, poor man.

783
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,727
- I don't....
- Goodbye.

784
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:47,890
Twenty bucks? Boy,
I'm in the wrong business.

785
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:55,773
Well, I think I've got
something very nice for you.

786
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,861
Merry Christmas.

787
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:04,031
I hear you want a doggy for Christmas.

788
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:09,036
Well, we just happen to have one here.

789
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:13,207
Here you go. Merry Christmas.

790
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:21,174
That's what makes it all worthwhile.

791
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:25,353
- How you doing, Santa?
- Are you kidding me?

792
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,981
You're cutting off the
circulation in my leg.

793
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:30,858
Oh, come on. The real Santa
Claus wouldn't care about that.

794
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:35,446
Oh, yeah? The real Santa Claus is kind of
busy this time of year, you might've noticed.

795
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:39,867
- Look, I'm here for my daughter.
- Oh, yeah? Why isn't she here herself?

796
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,787
I'll be honest. She's kind
of scared of Santa Claus.

797
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:47,083
- How does a kid not like Santa Claus?
- She must have sat on some Santa's lap...

798
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:51,254
that was sweating real bad and had bad
breath and asked a lot of nosy questions.

799
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:55,216
Okay, okay. Here you go.

800
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:56,718
This is for your daughter.

801
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:59,846
She wants that Harrison Bear.
Can I get the Harrison Bear?

802
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:01,055
She'll love the doll.

803
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:04,434
Santa Claus, I am not leaving your
lap until I get that Harrison Bear.

804
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:08,646
Matter of fact, I had some Mexican food
last night, and it's starting to bubble up.

805
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:13,026
You better give me that bear. If I explode,
you'll have to call Roto-Rooter for backup.

806
00:54:13,126 --> 00:54:17,396
Quick, get the bear. Give this
guy his bear. Give him his bear.

807
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:24,495
Oh, man. Santa Claus, you just made
a dad and a little girl real happy.

808
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:27,081
<i>- Hi, I'm Harrison.</i>
- And one from the bear.

809
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,742
I got me a bear.

810
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,797
I got a bear. I got a bear.

811
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:39,043
I got me a Harrison Bear.
I can't believe I got a bear.

812
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:43,381
- Is that a Harrison Bear?
- Sure is, buddy. I got it for my daughter.

813
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,851
She sure is lucky.

814
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:51,439
I wanted the same thing, but Daddy says
Santa's on a tight budget this year.

815
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:54,943
That's terrible. Well, maybe your
daddy will come up with something...

816
00:54:55,043 --> 00:54:57,139
...and you'll have a good
Christmas this year.

817
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:02,116
He can't. He doesn't get out
of jail till Valentine's Day.

818
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:07,488
He was just trying to steal enough
money so Mom could get her operation.

819
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:09,707
Man, that's really sad.

820
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:10,917
Oh, well.

821
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:13,753
I just hope Santa doesn't
forget me on Christmas...

822
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:15,630
like he did last year.

823
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,590
And the year before that.

824
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,168
And the year before that.

825
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:24,472
Hey, kid.

826
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:26,549
Catch.

827
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:29,394
You're giving me your
Harrison Talking Bear?

828
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:34,899
Yeah. I figure since Santa's on a tight
budget this year, I'll be Santa's helper.

829
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:37,477
So Merry Christmas.

830
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:40,438
Sucker.

831
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:47,829
And that's why some
couples just have pets.

832
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:49,572
I've been had.

833
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:51,908
Bring me back that bear!

834
00:55:52,392 --> 00:55:55,587
Sorry kid. Come back here!

835
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:58,372
Bring me back my bear!

836
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:06,672
Excuse me. Sorry. Give me that...
Give me that bear!

837
00:56:14,706 --> 00:56:17,525
I got you, you little punk.
Now give me that bear.

838
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:20,361
- Fat chance, tubby.
- Tubby? Come on.

839
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:24,282
You know that's hurtful. I'm not Tubby.
I'm big boned. Now give me that bear.

840
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:28,569
Please, mister. Don't take my
Harrison Bear. I'm begging you.

841
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:31,789
Kid, just give me the bear.

842
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:35,209
I won't let you take my bear,
no matter how much you threaten me.

843
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:38,296
Hey, what's going on here?
Are you threatening this little boy?

844
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:41,591
I'm not threatening that punk.
He tricked me out of that bear.

845
00:56:41,691 --> 00:56:46,512
It was a gift from my daddy, who's in jail.
And he wants to take it away from me.

846
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:49,933
That's real rich, kid. That's real rich.
You're pretty good, you know?

847
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:53,394
Larry. Just because you've
fallen on hard times...

848
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:56,856
that's no excuse to steal from a child.

849
00:56:56,956 --> 00:57:00,902
No. Y'all are misunderstanding the whole
thing about what's happening here.

850
00:57:01,002 --> 00:57:04,739
Oh, I understand. I understand
you should be put in jail.

851
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:07,575
- Come on. Let's get him.
- Let's get him.

852
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:10,778
Wait a minute. For the record, Janie...

853
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:12,747
I dumped you.

854
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:15,208
Oh, that's it. Let's get him!

855
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:17,377
- Let's get him!
- Get him!

856
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:19,328
Get him!

857
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:35,478
Nice work, kid.

858
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:37,930
Fifty bucks, as agreed.

859
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:42,277
- It'll be a hundred.
- We agreed on 50.

860
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:43,486
Delivery charges.

861
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:46,272
Or do you want me to give
it back to the doofus?

862
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:51,277
I'm starting to feel like
the doofus myself, kid.

863
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:53,288
On three.

864
00:57:53,388 --> 00:57:55,448
One, two, three.

865
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,914
Stupid bear.

866
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:05,258
<i>That tickles.</i>

867
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:07,969
Get back here! Get him!

868
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:10,555
- Come on, get him.
- There he is!

869
00:58:10,655 --> 00:58:11,798
Stop him!

870
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:14,675
Help!

871
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:31,734
Oh, he's faster than he looks.

872
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:35,830
He's gotta be around here somewhere.
Keep looking.

873
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,366
- Sinner! Sinner!
- Where did he go?

874
00:58:39,392 --> 00:58:42,962
This wouldn't have anything to do with
you trying to get that toy, would it?

875
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:45,757
It actually would, Maggie. Oh, boy.

876
00:58:45,857 --> 00:58:49,210
I need a cup of coffee.
And a defibrillator.

877
00:58:50,445 --> 00:58:53,264
<i>And in the final run-up
until Christmastime...</i>

878
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:57,310
<i>shoppers are swarming the malls
looking for last-minute gifts...</i>

879
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:58,728
<i>and stocking stuffers.</i>

880
00:58:58,828 --> 00:59:01,272
<i>But for those shoppers who
are hoping to pick up...</i>

881
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:06,444
<i>a Harrison Talking Bear before
Christmas are going to be out of luck.</i>

882
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:08,071
<i>Toy-store managers are saying...</i>

883
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:12,867
<i>that they don't expect any more Harrison
Talking Bears in until after Christmas.</i>

884
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:15,870
<i>For Channel One News, I'm Margo Price.</i>

885
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,580
<i>Thanks, Margo.</i>

886
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,158
Is there anything else on
the list you can get her?

887
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:25,213
How about a Mr. Potato Head?
Everybody loves potatoes.

888
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:27,915
Everybody don't like Potato Heads.

889
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:32,136
Besides, that Harrison Bear was the
only thing she had in the letter.

890
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:35,306
And I'm pretty sure Victor's
bought her everything else.

891
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:39,394
Boy, the one time of year I can do
something special for my little girl...

892
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:42,313
and ends up being an epic fail.

893
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:44,315
- It wasn't that bad of...
- It was a fail.

894
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:47,518
<i>For those of you who haven't
finished your Christmas shopping....</i>

895
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:03,367
At least it wasn't in the dip.

896
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,921
- Larry Phillips.
- Larry Phillips?

897
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:10,291
I understand you're in the market
for a Harrison Talking Bear.

898
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:14,512
Something about a Harrison
Talking Bear. Go ahead.

899
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:18,766
Come to McKibble's old junkyard and
meet me in the warehouse at midnight.

900
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:22,136
<i>Come alone and bring $500 cash.</i>

901
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:24,731
- Five hundred dollars?
- Five hundred dollars?

902
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:27,025
You sure you're calling the right house?

903
01:00:27,125 --> 01:00:30,778
Am I talking to the man who wants to
make his little girl happy? Am I correct?

904
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:34,657
Because if I'm not, I have a long
list of other parents who want to.

905
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:38,653
Hey, no, no, no. Listen, I'll be
there at midnight with the cash.

906
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:42,657
I gotta get $500 fast.

907
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,217
I think I'm gonna wait in the car.

908
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,337
I ain't going in there by myself.
You're coming with me.

909
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:02,468
Hello?

910
01:01:04,037 --> 01:01:05,813
Anybody here?

911
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:10,318
- No, so can we just leave now, please?
- I ain't leaving till I get what I come for.

912
01:01:10,418 --> 01:01:12,654
I got a bad feeling about
this place, Larry.

913
01:01:12,754 --> 01:01:17,075
Well, just figure it's like a
business transaction or something.

914
01:01:17,175 --> 01:01:18,534
- Business transaction?
- Yeah.

915
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:19,953
Oh, sure.

916
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:22,497
A business transaction in
the middle of the night...

917
01:01:22,597 --> 01:01:26,376
in a creepy, deserted place where
nobody can hear our screams for help.

918
01:01:26,476 --> 01:01:29,212
All right, enough. Knock it off.
You're freaking me out.

919
01:01:29,312 --> 01:01:33,007
- You're making me nervous.
- I should've waited in the car. I told you.

920
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:35,526
I told you to come alone.

921
01:01:35,626 --> 01:01:38,096
I got $500 in my pocket.
That's a lot of money.

922
01:01:38,196 --> 01:01:41,683
Whenever I leave the house with that
much, I bring a backup. Who are you?

923
01:01:41,783 --> 01:01:43,434
You didn't follow my instructions.

924
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:46,312
- Why are you talking like Batman?
- Yeah, he does a bit.

925
01:01:46,412 --> 01:01:49,482
- The original or the ones that came later?
- Ones that came later.

926
01:01:49,582 --> 01:01:50,692
- Which one?
- Scott Baio.

927
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:52,110
He wasn't Batman.

928
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:53,978
- He played that...
- That's enough!

929
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,648
You don't recognize me?
Maybe I should give you a hint.

930
01:01:58,049 --> 01:02:00,735
Merry Christmas, happy Holidays...

931
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:03,871
happy Hanukkah, happy Kwanzaa...

932
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:06,874
and a very happy winter solstice.

933
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:11,713
- That's the dude from the toy store.
- Working in a toy store has its advantages.

934
01:02:11,813 --> 01:02:13,331
Hey, it's me, Jeffrey.

935
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:18,970
Mild-mannered toy-store clerk by day,
purveyor of childhood fantasies by night.

936
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,513
For a price.

937
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:26,552
And since we all have our cards on the table,
I brought a little backup of my own.

938
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:29,897
Little backup?

939
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:33,860
- Oh, he meant that literally, didn't he?
- I knew elves were for real.

940
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,071
That's not an elf, brother.
That's the dude from <i>Taxi.</i>

941
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:41,743
Sebastian is a temporary
coworker at Toy Traders.

942
01:02:41,843 --> 01:02:44,746
What are y'all doing down
here scalping Harrison Bears?

943
01:02:44,846 --> 01:02:46,539
It's weird. Doesn't make any sense.

944
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:50,585
Because I have big plans, Larry. Big plans.
And I'll tell you something for free.

945
01:02:50,685 --> 01:02:52,670
They don't involve waiting five years...

946
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:55,965
to become a junior assistant
associate manager at Toy Traders...

947
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:59,761
nor do they involve dealing with
obnoxious parents like you...

948
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:04,966
who yell at me when I can't magically
produce whatever toy their kids want.

949
01:03:06,034 --> 01:03:07,635
Let's cut to the brass tacks.

950
01:03:09,037 --> 01:03:12,974
- You got the money?
- Yeah, I got the money.

951
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:17,779
- Do you got the item?
- Yeah, we got the item.

952
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:19,605
All right.

953
01:03:21,049 --> 01:03:23,952
<i>Hi, I'm Harrison. What's your name?</i>

954
01:03:24,052 --> 01:03:25,662
Oh, shut up.

955
01:03:25,762 --> 01:03:29,290
<i>Hi, Shut Up. Nice to meet you.</i>

956
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:32,502
I really hate these things.

957
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:34,162
Okay, let's see the cash.

958
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,832
- There it is.
- My associate will count it.

959
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:42,837
- It's all there.
- We're gonna find out if it's all there.

960
01:03:43,488 --> 01:03:45,590
How's it look? Great.

961
01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:50,428
Looks like your quest is over, Larry.

962
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:54,015
Oh, man. This is finally gonna be over.

963
01:03:54,707 --> 01:03:56,684
Police. Everybody freeze.

964
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,689
- I knew they were monitoring my phone.
- Put your hands up.

965
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:04,826
Don't shoot. My father is a veteran.

966
01:04:04,926 --> 01:04:09,030
- Sebastian, hide the evidence.
- You ain't going anywhere with that bear.

967
01:04:13,101 --> 01:04:14,786
Freeze.

968
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:17,371
Hi.

969
01:04:17,939 --> 01:04:21,209
There's gotta be a better way to
get your Christmas shopping done.

970
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:25,221
I didn't steal those.

971
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:29,142
Just because I work at a toy store doesn't
mean those bears came from that store.

972
01:04:29,242 --> 01:04:31,603
I'm sure the judge will
wanna hear all about that.

973
01:04:31,703 --> 01:04:34,856
Thank you. We'll be in touch in
case we need you two as witnesses.

974
01:04:34,956 --> 01:04:38,860
- What are you gonna do with all them bears?
- They're being impounded as evidence.

975
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,946
You think maybe I could get one
for my daughter for Christmas?

976
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:45,658
- I'm sorry, sir, we can't do that.
- But you have so many. We just need one.

977
01:04:45,758 --> 01:04:47,035
Yeah, I'll even buy one.

978
01:04:47,135 --> 01:04:49,662
I'm sorry, sir. They all
have to be accounted for.

979
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:52,540
You two have a good night.
Happy holidays.

980
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,878
Yeah, and a merry Christmas to you too
and all that... All that other stuff.

981
01:04:56,978 --> 01:05:00,381
Well, at least we got the money back.

982
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:02,959
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

983
01:05:05,737 --> 01:05:08,389
If I tell you something,
you promise not to laugh at me?

984
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:09,724
Sure.

985
01:05:09,824 --> 01:05:14,220
When that elf flipped me,
I pooped my pants a little.

986
01:05:21,544 --> 01:05:25,406
You guys going to the tree
lighting tonight? Looks fun.

987
01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:28,109
I'm going. You going, Lar?

988
01:05:29,761 --> 01:05:32,664
You know what, Claude?
I'm beginning to think you were right.

989
01:05:32,764 --> 01:05:33,915
- Really?
- Yup.

990
01:05:34,015 --> 01:05:35,416
About what?

991
01:05:35,516 --> 01:05:38,086
It's ridiculous to think I
could compete with Victor.

992
01:05:38,186 --> 01:05:41,673
- Oh, it's about time.
- It is about time.

993
01:05:41,773 --> 01:05:44,634
It's about time I realized that
Christmas is about giving...

994
01:05:44,734 --> 01:05:46,844
not who's taking credit for something.

995
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:50,765
And it's about spending time with my
daughter, not fighting with her stepdad.

996
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:53,050
That's the spirit.

997
01:05:53,242 --> 01:05:55,489
I'm really glad to hear
you say that, Larry.

998
01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:57,647
Yeah. Yeah. Tell you what.

999
01:05:57,747 --> 01:06:00,640
What a better time than a tree
lighting to show a little

1000
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:02,944
peace and goodwill toward Victor?

1001
01:06:03,044 --> 01:06:07,448
I mean, you know, there's plenty of
room for both of us in Noel's life.

1002
01:06:07,548 --> 01:06:09,200
- Besides...
- Hey, check this out.

1003
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,078
<i>Parents everywhere have been
frustrated this Christmas...</i>

1004
01:06:12,178 --> 01:06:16,708
<i>by the fact that there are no more
Harrison Talking Bears on toy shelves.</i>

1005
01:06:16,808 --> 01:06:18,566
<i>How do you look your kid
in the eye and tell him</i>

1006
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:21,421
<i>Santa can't give him the
one thing he wants?</i>

1007
01:06:21,562 --> 01:06:25,466
<i>She looks up at me and says, "But,
Mommy, it's the only thing I want."</i>

1008
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:27,385
<i>It just breaks my heart.</i>

1009
01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:30,638
<i>But there is a new wrinkle that
has developed in this story.</i>

1010
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:34,309
<i>According to various reports and
in the words of one manager...</i>

1011
01:06:34,409 --> 01:06:39,939
<i>there were plenty of Harrison Talking Bears
in stock as recently as a few days ago.</i>

1012
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:43,651
<i>But according to various
witnesses in toy stores...</i>

1013
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:46,321
<i>all the remaining Harrison
Bears were bought up...</i>

1014
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:50,491
<i>by the same unidentified
white male in large lots...</i>

1015
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:54,078
<i>perhaps to be sold on the black
market to desperate parents.</i>

1016
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:59,000
<i>And so it would seem someone somewhere
is hoarding Harrison Talking Bears.</i>

1017
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,336
<i>- For Channel One News....</i>
- That is crazy.

1018
01:07:01,436 --> 01:07:05,465
Yeah. I mean, somebody would have
to have a whole lot of money...

1019
01:07:05,565 --> 01:07:07,834
to buy every single bear in town.

1020
01:07:09,485 --> 01:07:13,181
And who do we know that
has a whole lot of money?

1021
01:07:13,281 --> 01:07:16,142
You don't think Victor had
something to do with this, do you?

1022
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:18,895
Yeah, Claude, I do.

1023
01:07:18,995 --> 01:07:20,939
Claude, he knows. He knows.

1024
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,474
He must have found out
what was in Noel's letter.

1025
01:07:24,459 --> 01:07:28,321
Man, I'm out of here. I'll see you
down at the tree lighting later.

1026
01:07:28,421 --> 01:07:29,697
Where are you going?

1027
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:32,992
If Victor's been buying these bears,
I know where he's keeping them.

1028
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:35,903
I'm gonna go there, I'm gonna
get me one of them bears.

1029
01:07:36,262 --> 01:07:40,199
When I get one, down goes Victor.

1030
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,922
- Good night, Betsy.
- See you at the ceremony.

1031
01:07:59,702 --> 01:08:01,354
Hey, you closing early?

1032
01:08:01,454 --> 01:08:04,565
Our company is sponsoring the
tree-lighting event this evening.

1033
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:06,526
A lot of us are heading over there.

1034
01:08:06,626 --> 01:08:10,029
Hey, that's good. Well, I got a
package here for Victor Baxter.

1035
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:13,366
- Oh, thanks. I can sign for it.
- You ain't gonna believe this.

1036
01:08:13,466 --> 01:08:17,412
A couple of women on their way in thought
I looked like Brad Pitt. You believe that?

1037
01:08:17,512 --> 01:08:18,863
Yeah, a little. Yeah.

1038
01:08:19,681 --> 01:08:23,084
All right. Hey, do me a favor.
Make sure this gets up to him fast, okay?

1039
01:08:23,184 --> 01:08:26,462
- It says "urgent" right on there.
- I'll take it up to him right away.

1040
01:08:26,562 --> 01:08:30,208
Good. And tell him it has something to
do with Operation Who's Your Daddy.

1041
01:08:31,651 --> 01:08:33,127
And I hate doing it to you.

1042
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,797
You got a toilet in here?

1043
01:08:36,948 --> 01:08:41,219
- Yeah.
- Yes. It's just down the hall on the right.

1044
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:45,648
You're a lifesaver.
Merry Christmas to you.

1045
01:08:45,748 --> 01:08:48,559
- Brad Pitt.
- Brad Pitt.

1046
01:08:50,586 --> 01:08:52,488
Yeah. Yeah.

1047
01:08:52,588 --> 01:08:55,283
- Mr. Baxter.
- Yeah, I'm leaving now.

1048
01:08:55,383 --> 01:08:58,453
Yeah. I'll see you downtown right
next to the tree. Love you too.

1049
01:08:58,553 --> 01:09:01,989
Perfect timing. I was just
bringing this package up to you.

1050
01:09:02,348 --> 01:09:04,751
- It just arrived. They said it was urgent.
- Thanks.

1051
01:09:04,851 --> 01:09:10,623
And the delivery guy said it was for
something called Operation Who's Your Daddy.

1052
01:09:11,441 --> 01:09:14,719
Really? It must be from Welling.

1053
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:18,139
I'll see you at the tree lighting.
I'm looking forward to your speech.

1054
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:19,632
Me too.

1055
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:31,986
That's right, Victor.

1056
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:35,440
Take me right to Harrison.

1057
01:09:41,637 --> 01:09:43,698
Where is Victor Baxter?

1058
01:09:46,726 --> 01:09:48,202
Oh, no, no, no.

1059
01:09:53,024 --> 01:09:56,169
- It's empty.
- That's the point.

1060
01:09:58,988 --> 01:10:01,975
Go, go, go.

1061
01:10:02,075 --> 01:10:05,687
- No, no, do not touch that.
- Hey, this is so beautiful.

1062
01:10:05,787 --> 01:10:08,147
- Where's Larry?
- Last-minute Christmas shopping.

1063
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,650
- Did he find that bear?
- We'll see.

1064
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:13,528
Oh, hey, Sharon, Mike. Hi.

1065
01:10:13,628 --> 01:10:16,281
- Now, this is what I call....
- The Christmas spirit.

1066
01:10:16,381 --> 01:10:18,491
- Indeed.
- Indeed.

1067
01:10:18,591 --> 01:10:20,702
This is so beautiful.

1068
01:10:20,802 --> 01:10:25,698
- And our family's putting on the event.
- That's right, sweet pea.

1069
01:11:23,698 --> 01:11:27,301
- Is this supposed to be a joke?
- Yeah, and you're the punch line.

1070
01:11:30,538 --> 01:11:32,231
Biscuits and gravy.

1071
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:34,609
Larry, this is not what it looks like.

1072
01:11:34,709 --> 01:11:38,312
It looks like you've been buying these
Harrison Bears so I can't get one.

1073
01:11:38,588 --> 01:11:40,531
Okay, maybe it is what it looks like.

1074
01:11:40,631 --> 01:11:44,577
Well, that's the lowest of the low, Victor.
You know that? You're an idiot.

1075
01:11:44,677 --> 01:11:48,915
To get back at me, you're gonna make sure
Noel don't get the Christmas she most wants.

1076
01:11:49,015 --> 01:11:52,627
No, no, no. She's gonna get a
Harrison Talking Bear, all right.

1077
01:11:52,727 --> 01:11:55,880
Only it's coming from her new
dad instead of her old one.

1078
01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:00,134
- It will be the first present she opens.
- When she opens it up, know what she'll say?

1079
01:12:00,234 --> 01:12:02,303
"Thanks, but I already
got a Harrison Bear.

1080
01:12:02,403 --> 01:12:05,473
- Dad gave it to me at the tree lighting."
- You wouldn't dare.

1081
01:12:05,573 --> 01:12:08,977
The last couple of days, you'd be
surprised what I'd do for my daughter.

1082
01:12:09,077 --> 01:12:10,937
- Is that a leak?
- No, we don't have...

1083
01:12:11,037 --> 01:12:13,806
- Hey, not so fast.
- See you later.

1084
01:12:14,415 --> 01:12:16,359
Get off me.

1085
01:12:16,459 --> 01:12:18,686
Get off me.

1086
01:12:20,129 --> 01:12:23,199
Great. Now look what you've done.

1087
01:12:23,299 --> 01:12:25,994
I didn't do nothing. I ain't
gonna pay for a new handle.

1088
01:12:26,094 --> 01:12:28,621
No, you idiot. We're locked in.

1089
01:12:28,721 --> 01:12:31,583
- What do you mean we're locked in?
- I mean we're locked in.

1090
01:12:31,683 --> 01:12:32,825
Are you kidding me?

1091
01:12:34,227 --> 01:12:38,631
Hey! Ain't you got another door,
like another way out or something?

1092
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:41,876
Afraid not. And no one's
coming back for two days.

1093
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:46,848
You mean we're trapped in here for two days?
I'm gonna miss Christmas with my little girl?

1094
01:12:46,948 --> 01:12:49,517
And I'm gonna have to
spend it with you? Help!

1095
01:12:49,617 --> 01:12:53,387
Hello! Hey! Open sesame.

1096
01:12:54,539 --> 01:12:55,973
Help!

1097
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:59,811
You're wasting your time.
It's locked from the outside.

1098
01:13:01,796 --> 01:13:04,398
Nice job, genius.

1099
01:13:04,716 --> 01:13:06,025
What?

1100
01:13:09,053 --> 01:13:10,446
<i>Hi, I'm Harrison.</i>

1101
01:13:11,973 --> 01:13:13,333
<i>Leave a message.</i>

1102
01:13:13,433 --> 01:13:15,835
Hi, Victor.
Just wondering where you are.

1103
01:13:15,935 --> 01:13:18,671
We're here at the
tree-lighting ceremony.

1104
01:13:18,771 --> 01:13:22,083
I guess we'll just see you
when you get here. Okay. Bye.

1105
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:24,886
Is Victor coming soon?

1106
01:13:24,986 --> 01:13:28,348
He's probably on his
way right now. Come on.

1107
01:13:28,448 --> 01:13:29,849
Excuse me.

1108
01:13:29,949 --> 01:13:34,095
Hi, are you Nate Welling, head of
security for Baxter Box Company?

1109
01:13:34,871 --> 01:13:37,148
- Yes.
- Would you like to comment...

1110
01:13:37,248 --> 01:13:40,151
on the sudden shortage
of Harrison Talking Bears...

1111
01:13:40,251 --> 01:13:41,819
in toy stores all over town?

1112
01:13:41,919 --> 01:13:43,863
I was not aware of that.

1113
01:13:43,963 --> 01:13:47,158
You were not aware that a man
has been going around...

1114
01:13:47,258 --> 01:13:50,495
and buying up all the Harrison
Talking Bears in bulk...

1115
01:13:50,595 --> 01:13:53,114
thereby creating a shortage
just before Christmas?

1116
01:13:53,681 --> 01:13:56,084
Well, I know about it now.

1117
01:13:56,184 --> 01:13:59,003
It seems that every bear has
been bought and paid for...

1118
01:13:59,103 --> 01:14:02,048
by a Baxter Box Company credit card.

1119
01:14:02,148 --> 01:14:04,926
And all the bears have been
signed and paid for...

1120
01:14:05,026 --> 01:14:07,587
by someone named N. Welling.

1121
01:14:08,321 --> 01:14:11,432
- That would be you, wouldn't it?
- Not necessarily.

1122
01:14:11,532 --> 01:14:15,728
Oh, so there is more than one N.
Welling working at Baxter Box Company?

1123
01:14:15,828 --> 01:14:19,857
Why would I buy up Harrison
Talking Bears? I don't even have kids.

1124
01:14:19,957 --> 01:14:24,195
How about Victor Baxter,
the president of Baxter Box Company?

1125
01:14:24,295 --> 01:14:27,648
- Would he have something to do with this?
- No, absolutely not.

1126
01:14:28,174 --> 01:14:31,911
Oh, so this is something that
you are doing on your own.

1127
01:14:32,011 --> 01:14:34,322
You greedy jerk.

1128
01:14:34,889 --> 01:14:38,042
My little girl wanted one of those
bears more than anything else.

1129
01:14:38,142 --> 01:14:39,660
You ruined her Christmas.

1130
01:14:40,937 --> 01:14:42,880
No comment.

1131
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,215
- I mean...
- How dare you?

1132
01:14:44,315 --> 01:14:47,168
- Shame on you.
- I wasn't trying to ruin anyone's Christmas.

1133
01:14:47,777 --> 01:14:52,223
Well, then what were you trying
to do, then, Mr. Welling?

1134
01:14:52,323 --> 01:14:55,393
- What's the deal here?
- Yeah, what's going on?

1135
01:14:55,493 --> 01:14:57,979
- What is the meaning of this?
- We want the truth.

1136
01:14:58,079 --> 01:14:59,522
We want the truth.

1137
01:14:59,622 --> 01:15:03,192
<i>We want the truth. We want the truth.</i>

1138
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:06,145
It wasn't me. It was Victor Baxter.

1139
01:15:07,672 --> 01:15:11,409
He made me buy up all the bears. I was
just doing what my employer told me to.

1140
01:15:11,509 --> 01:15:14,695
- How dare you?
- So Victor Baxter is responsible for this.

1141
01:15:18,307 --> 01:15:20,919
- Yes.
- You big meanie.

1142
01:15:21,019 --> 01:15:22,537
- Shame on you.
- Hey.

1143
01:15:30,236 --> 01:15:32,680
<i>- Hey.</i>
- I'm about to teach you a little humility.

1144
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:35,216
<i>Harrison loves exercise.</i>

1145
01:15:36,117 --> 01:15:37,602
<i>- Let's play.</i>
- Yeah, well...

1146
01:15:37,702 --> 01:15:39,520
<i>- Hey, that's...</i>
- Humility this.

1147
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:44,142
<i>Will you be my friend? I love you.</i>

1148
01:15:46,502 --> 01:15:49,197
- What the heck was that?
- I'm warning you.

1149
01:15:49,297 --> 01:15:52,283
I've watched <i>The Matrix </i>37 times.

1150
01:15:52,383 --> 01:15:55,403
<i>- Let's play.</i>
- You need to get out of the house more.

1151
01:15:56,304 --> 01:15:58,239
Let's bear-knuckle it, boys.

1152
01:15:58,639 --> 01:15:59,740
That's it.

1153
01:16:02,268 --> 01:16:03,828
Come on, son.

1154
01:16:06,314 --> 01:16:07,582
Come on.

1155
01:16:09,067 --> 01:16:13,004
- Hit him with the southpaw.
- That's a good one. Right there.

1156
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:17,925
- Time-out. Time-out. Time-out.<i>
- That tickles.</i>

1157
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:22,397
You know you started this
whole thing, you know.

1158
01:16:22,497 --> 01:16:25,567
Talking about what we're gonna do
for Christmas in front of Noel.

1159
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:28,236
I admit that was a mistake.

1160
01:16:28,336 --> 01:16:31,939
It's my first Christmas with Noel,
and I wanted it to go well.

1161
01:16:32,674 --> 01:16:36,869
- Besides, I've never been a dad before.
- You're a stepdad.

1162
01:16:36,969 --> 01:16:39,664
And there it is right there.

1163
01:16:39,764 --> 01:16:42,166
- What? Where? What?
- "What? Where? What?"

1164
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:46,746
The way you just said "stepdad."
Like it was some kind of lower form of life.

1165
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:53,428
You know, it is not easy competing
with Mr. Perfect-Dad, you know.

1166
01:16:53,528 --> 01:16:56,389
Perfect-Dad? Are you kidding me?

1167
01:16:56,489 --> 01:16:59,767
By avoiding any semblance
of responsibility...

1168
01:16:59,867 --> 01:17:02,145
you're always happy and relaxed.

1169
01:17:02,245 --> 01:17:04,939
And since you work
as little as possible...

1170
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:08,943
you're always free to take her
places and do things with her.

1171
01:17:09,043 --> 01:17:13,773
So that's it. So since you think I'm
a failure, I'm a winner in Noel's eyes.

1172
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:16,659
Let me tell you something...

1173
01:17:16,759 --> 01:17:20,371
Mr. I-Paid-$40,000-to-Get-All-These
Harrison-Bears-so-I-Couldn't-Get-One.

1174
01:17:20,471 --> 01:17:23,291
I pay all my taxes.
I don't owe a cent to anybody.

1175
01:17:23,391 --> 01:17:26,628
I ain't never took a handout,
and I take care of my support for Noel.

1176
01:17:26,728 --> 01:17:30,498
And I ain't gotta apologize to
anybody for nothing, especially you.

1177
01:17:31,733 --> 01:17:33,259
Okay, fair enough.

1178
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:35,970
Well, try explaining that to
a little 8-year-old girl...

1179
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:38,932
whose stepdad lives in a
mansion and has a chef...

1180
01:17:39,032 --> 01:17:42,268
and can buy her anything he
wants anytime she wants it.

1181
01:17:42,368 --> 01:17:46,439
Okay, I see. So the problem
is I'm too successful.

1182
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:48,840
Well, let me tell you something, bub.

1183
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:52,528
Like you, I have never taken anything
from anybody. I work hard for what I have.

1184
01:17:52,628 --> 01:17:56,157
Victor, I'm not begrudging your success,
okay? I'm very happy for you.

1185
01:17:56,257 --> 01:17:59,452
It ain't about that, all right?

1186
01:17:59,552 --> 01:18:01,996
It's about Noel.

1187
01:18:02,096 --> 01:18:06,492
It's about me trying to
compete with you. I can't do it.

1188
01:18:07,769 --> 01:18:10,463
I'm not sure I'm ever gonna
learn to like you, okay?

1189
01:18:10,563 --> 01:18:13,508
- Or me you.
- But because of Noel...

1190
01:18:13,608 --> 01:18:16,010
I'm stuck with you,
and you're stuck with me.

1191
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:19,338
So we gotta figure out a
way to get along, okay?

1192
01:18:19,906 --> 01:18:24,310
Okay. Agreed. That doesn't change
the fact that we're still stuck in here.

1193
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:26,229
We need to find some way to get out...

1194
01:18:26,329 --> 01:18:29,607
or Noel ain't gonna have any one
of her dads there for Christmas.

1195
01:18:29,707 --> 01:18:31,734
Cell phones.

1196
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:34,395
Come on. Here we go.

1197
01:18:37,298 --> 01:18:40,151
- I got no reception.
- Me either. Metal building.

1198
01:18:43,388 --> 01:18:46,124
- That's a good one. I haven't seen that one.
- You like it?

1199
01:18:46,224 --> 01:18:48,042
- Look at that.
- Look at that.

1200
01:18:48,142 --> 01:18:50,962
Look at that umbrella she got.

1201
01:18:51,062 --> 01:18:54,081
I'll tell you what,
that's from us at the fair.

1202
01:18:55,817 --> 01:18:59,554
- Well, we gotta get out of here.
- Yes, we do.

1203
01:18:59,654 --> 01:19:02,390
If I got out of high school,
I can get out of this place.

1204
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:04,851
This time it ain't gonna take six years.

1205
01:19:04,951 --> 01:19:07,929
I'm just kidding, Vic. Five.

1206
01:19:14,627 --> 01:19:16,946
Yeah. Christmas is back on, baby.

1207
01:19:17,046 --> 01:19:19,407
- Well done, Larry.
- Okay, here's the plan.

1208
01:19:19,507 --> 01:19:22,744
What I'll do then is I'll just head
by the Christmas-tree lighting...

1209
01:19:22,844 --> 01:19:25,288
and I'll pick up Noel for
Christmas number one.

1210
01:19:25,388 --> 01:19:29,125
Then Trish and I will come by tomorrow
to pick her up for Christmas number two.

1211
01:19:29,225 --> 01:19:30,835
Yeah, I guess that'll work.

1212
01:19:30,935 --> 01:19:33,212
- Why don't we do Christmas together?
- Together.

1213
01:19:33,312 --> 01:19:36,090
- I was just gonna say that.
- I was thinking the same thing.

1214
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:39,677
Come by my house. I'm an unbelievable cook.
I got... I make good turkey.

1215
01:19:39,777 --> 01:19:41,596
- Awesome.
- All right.

1216
01:19:41,696 --> 01:19:42,839
Let's call Trish.

1217
01:19:43,031 --> 01:19:47,268
<i>Down with Baxter Boxes!
Down with Baxter Boxes!</i>

1218
01:19:47,368 --> 01:19:48,937
<i>Down with Baxter Boxes!</i>

1219
01:19:49,037 --> 01:19:50,730
Victor, where have you been?

1220
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:52,857
It's a long story.

1221
01:19:52,957 --> 01:19:56,236
Well, Larry's missing too.
He never came to pick up Noel.

1222
01:19:56,336 --> 01:19:59,405
Oh, hi, Trish. I'm here too,
which is another long story.

1223
01:19:59,505 --> 01:20:01,399
Yeah, we were just coming to meet you.

1224
01:20:01,924 --> 01:20:05,787
Well, you better not come down, Victor.
It's gotten completely out of control.

1225
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,622
What are you talking about?

1226
01:20:07,722 --> 01:20:11,459
Somehow everyone's gotten the idea that
you bought up all the Harrison Bears...

1227
01:20:11,559 --> 01:20:13,670
so that no one else could have one.

1228
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:15,079
Is that true?

1229
01:20:16,064 --> 01:20:19,133
In a manner of speaking,
it's another long story.

1230
01:20:19,233 --> 01:20:20,635
I'll explain it all later.

1231
01:20:20,735 --> 01:20:26,140
Well, they're calling you Ebenezer
Baxter and Victor the Grinch.

1232
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:29,686
You just shouldn't even show
your face down here, Victor.

1233
01:20:29,786 --> 01:20:31,479
It's not safe.

1234
01:20:31,579 --> 01:20:35,141
All right. Thanks for
the heads-up. Bye, hon.

1235
01:20:39,712 --> 01:20:43,658
- Come on, honey.
- Why is everybody so mad at Victor?

1236
01:20:43,758 --> 01:20:47,662
It's.... It's complicated.

1237
01:20:47,762 --> 01:20:51,291
The Baxter name has been one of the
most respected in town for 70 years...

1238
01:20:51,391 --> 01:20:53,668
and in one night, I destroy it.

1239
01:20:53,768 --> 01:20:55,587
Hold on, Victor.

1240
01:20:55,687 --> 01:20:59,340
Even though you deserve everything
you got coming to you...

1241
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,259
I feel sorry for you, okay?

1242
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:05,179
- Thank you. But, Larry, everyone hates me.
- Everybody doesn't hate you.

1243
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:06,389
Trish likes you.

1244
01:21:06,489 --> 01:21:08,891
Well, she's married to me.
She has to like me.

1245
01:21:08,991 --> 01:21:10,968
Well, Noel likes you.

1246
01:21:11,953 --> 01:21:13,554
- Really?
- Yeah.

1247
01:21:14,455 --> 01:21:16,390
Gotta say, I think she loves you.

1248
01:21:19,085 --> 01:21:22,814
And I'll be honest. I'm kind of starting
to not dislike like you myself.

1249
01:21:26,009 --> 01:21:29,987
I guess I should head home and
barricade the doors for the angry mob.

1250
01:21:31,014 --> 01:21:33,407
Hey, wait a second.

1251
01:21:33,641 --> 01:21:35,910
We're going to that
Christmas-tree lighting.

1252
01:21:36,602 --> 01:21:38,630
Are you crazy?
Did you hear what she said?

1253
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:41,758
- They'll kill me. I can't go back there.
- I got an idea.

1254
01:21:41,858 --> 01:21:45,887
If it works, you're gonna go from town
goat to town hero in about 10 minutes.

1255
01:21:45,987 --> 01:21:47,588
And if you're wrong?

1256
01:21:48,156 --> 01:21:49,882
I'll be one of your pallbearers.

1257
01:21:52,994 --> 01:21:55,146
Dead man walking.

1258
01:21:55,246 --> 01:21:59,609
<i>Down with Baxter Boxes!
Down with Baxter Boxes!</i>

1259
01:21:59,709 --> 01:22:04,739
<i>Down with Baxter Boxes!
Down with Baxter Boxes!</i>

1260
01:22:04,839 --> 01:22:08,067
Hey. Hey, there's the Baxter Box truck.

1261
01:22:21,481 --> 01:22:23,841
- Victor, are you ready?
- I don't know about this.

1262
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:28,096
- It's gonna take a miracle for this to work.
- It's Christmas. It's a time for miracles.

1263
01:22:28,196 --> 01:22:31,382
- Just have a little faith, buddy.
- Well, you know, I just...

1264
01:22:35,453 --> 01:22:38,523
Can I have your attention, please?
Can I have your attention...?

1265
01:22:38,623 --> 01:22:41,276
Can I have your attention, please?

1266
01:22:41,376 --> 01:22:43,361
What's Daddy doing?

1267
01:22:43,461 --> 01:22:46,105
I don't know what
he's doing, sweetheart.

1268
01:22:48,341 --> 01:22:51,536
Come on, stop. Would you knock it off?
I'm trying to say something.

1269
01:22:51,636 --> 01:22:53,321
I'm trying to speak!

1270
01:23:00,687 --> 01:23:03,631
Everybody, please, just zip it.

1271
01:23:03,731 --> 01:23:05,666
Let the man speak!

1272
01:23:06,025 --> 01:23:07,719
- Please.
- Thank you.

1273
01:23:07,819 --> 01:23:12,140
Apparently, a lot of y'all here have been
given some inaccurate information...

1274
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,968
about Victor Baxter and Baxter Boxes.

1275
01:23:17,078 --> 01:23:18,930
Hold on! Let me speak!

1276
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:22,567
I'm here to tell you you got it
all wrong about Victor Baxter.

1277
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:26,779
He's not here to ruin Christmas.
He's here to make it better.

1278
01:23:26,879 --> 01:23:29,365
No! Listen! Just hold on!

1279
01:23:29,465 --> 01:23:35,246
Cool it! This whole thing was a
surprise by the Baxter Box Company...

1280
01:23:35,346 --> 01:23:38,833
and it has been planned for a
long time, and it fooled even me.

1281
01:23:38,933 --> 01:23:41,294
Let me show you what I mean.
Everybody, follow me.

1282
01:23:41,394 --> 01:23:42,670
Please. Follow me, please.

1283
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:45,423
- Stand back. Follow me.
- Seriously, no more lying...

1284
01:23:45,523 --> 01:23:47,467
Hold on. Ladies and gentlemen...

1285
01:23:47,567 --> 01:23:51,137
compliments of Victor Baxter
and the Baxter Box Company...

1286
01:23:51,237 --> 01:23:53,714
merry Christmas.

1287
01:23:57,285 --> 01:23:59,220
Look at it, Mommy.

1288
01:23:59,537 --> 01:24:02,140
- So many bears.
- The bears!

1289
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:05,059
Victor, say your line.

1290
01:24:05,501 --> 01:24:07,895
- What line?
- Your line.

1291
01:24:11,966 --> 01:24:14,902
Merry Christmas from Baxter Box Company.

1292
01:24:15,762 --> 01:24:19,991
I have free Harrison Bears
for everybody who wants one.

1293
01:24:26,647 --> 01:24:28,166
It's a miracle.

1294
01:24:32,987 --> 01:24:34,338
Yeah?

1295
01:24:35,448 --> 01:24:37,758
Merry Christmas.

1296
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:39,727
There you are. Merry Christmas.

1297
01:24:39,827 --> 01:24:40,937
- Hey, Lar.
- Yeah?

1298
01:24:41,037 --> 01:24:43,064
- I owe you one.
- Darn right you do.

1299
01:24:43,164 --> 01:24:46,267
Don't think I'm gonna let
you forget about it later.

1300
01:24:47,251 --> 01:24:51,105
- Thank you. Thank you so much.<i>
- Happy Holidays.</i>

1301
01:24:51,756 --> 01:24:54,108
- Thank you, Santa.
- Merry Christmas.

1302
01:24:55,677 --> 01:25:00,281
Merry Christmas to everybody
from Baxter Boxes.

1303
01:25:24,122 --> 01:25:26,649
- Can I open my present now, please?
- Yeah.

1304
01:25:26,749 --> 01:25:29,110
- This one is from me.
- And me.

1305
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:30,603
Okay, it's from both of you.

1306
01:25:31,004 --> 01:25:34,440
- Right, guys?
- That's right. It was my idea, though.

1307
01:25:41,723 --> 01:25:43,449
What is it?

1308
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:45,618
Hey!

1309
01:25:49,272 --> 01:25:51,833
- Honey?
- Thanks.

1310
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:56,054
- Honey, that's a Harrison.
- The Talking Bear.

1311
01:25:56,154 --> 01:25:59,057
Yeah, I know. Like, you handed
them out at the tree lighting.

1312
01:25:59,157 --> 01:26:02,143
But wasn't Harrison what you asked
for in your letter to Santa?

1313
01:26:02,243 --> 01:26:06,564
Dad, you said you wouldn't show
anyone my letter except Santa.

1314
01:26:06,664 --> 01:26:07,857
Yeah....

1315
01:26:07,957 --> 01:26:11,694
Santa Claus dropped it the other night,
and Victor come along and picked it up.

1316
01:26:11,794 --> 01:26:16,324
I did. I did. I found it.
And then I gave it back to Larry.

1317
01:26:16,424 --> 01:26:19,577
Yeah, you sure did, and I got
the letter in here. Hold on.

1318
01:26:19,677 --> 01:26:21,204
Look what you said here.

1319
01:26:21,304 --> 01:26:25,166
"Dear Santa: For Christmas I want
my family to get a Harrison.

1320
01:26:25,266 --> 01:26:26,626
Love, Noel."

1321
01:26:26,726 --> 01:26:28,294
No, Dad. What it says is:

1322
01:26:28,394 --> 01:26:33,841
"Dear Santa: All I want for Christmas
is my family together as one.

1323
01:26:33,941 --> 01:26:36,043
Love, me."

1324
01:26:42,033 --> 01:26:43,851
I get it.

1325
01:26:43,951 --> 01:26:45,228
Me too.

1326
01:26:45,328 --> 01:26:48,815
"Together as one."

1327
01:26:48,915 --> 01:26:51,726
Boy, we're a couple of doofuses,
you know that?

1328
01:26:53,586 --> 01:26:56,898
And look, Santa gave me
exactly what I asked for.

1329
01:26:57,423 --> 01:27:01,327
My family together as one.

1330
01:27:01,427 --> 01:27:02,904
Sweetheart.

1331
01:27:03,971 --> 01:27:07,074
That's so beautiful.

1332
01:27:10,311 --> 01:27:12,177
Here we go.

1333
01:27:12,277 --> 01:27:14,091
- Who's hungry?
- I am.

1334
01:27:14,191 --> 01:27:16,167
Don't worry. I'll have
it carved up in no time.

1335
01:27:16,267 --> 01:27:18,553
No, look, it's my house.
Let me carve that turkey.

1336
01:27:18,653 --> 01:27:21,723
Larry, the turkey is traditionally
carved by the paterfamilias.

1337
01:27:21,823 --> 01:27:24,392
There's a 7-year-old over there.
Watch your language.

1338
01:27:24,492 --> 01:27:26,561
- I'll carve the turkey.
- I have an idea.

1339
01:27:26,661 --> 01:27:30,857
Why don't you both carve the turkey,
since you're both my dads?

1340
01:27:30,957 --> 01:27:33,392
Well, I'm here now, sweetheart.

1341
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:45,071
Well, who likes it extra crispy?

1342
01:27:46,139 --> 01:27:49,208
Why don't we go out for dinner?

1343
01:27:49,308 --> 01:27:51,628
- That sounds like a good idea.
- Sounds good to me.

1344
01:27:51,728 --> 01:27:54,714
See? Now you two can finally
agree on something.

1345
01:27:54,814 --> 01:27:57,133
- Why don't we do sushi?
- We'll get Mexican.

1346
01:27:57,233 --> 01:27:58,384
- Italian.
- Persian.

1347
01:27:58,484 --> 01:27:59,636
- Chinese.
- Mediterranean?

1348
01:27:59,736 --> 01:28:01,095
- Sloppy joe.
- Korean. French?

1349
01:28:01,195 --> 01:28:02,430
- You guys.
