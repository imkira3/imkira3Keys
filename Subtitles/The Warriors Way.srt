2
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,393
Okay.
Settle down.

3
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:27,224
Got your ears open?

4
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:34,065
This is the story of a sad flute

5
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:37,026
a laughing baby and a weeping sword.

6
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:50,581
A long, long time ago
in a land far, far away,

7
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:53,292
there lived a warrior...

8
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:56,003
...warrior with empty eyes.

9
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,527
He'd trained his entire life
for one purpose.

10
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,984
To be the greatest swordsman
in the history of mankind.

11
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,077
He'd just achieved his life's ambition,

12
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,875
but his heart felt emptier than ever.

13
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:40,042
These two clans had been warring
for 500 years.

14
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:43,095
And they vowed to keep on warring
until one of them

15
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:45,593
didn't have a single man
left above Styx.

16
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,376
And so now, here he was,

17
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:21,425
peering down
at this very last of his enemy.

18
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,976
When that
little warrior princess giggled,

19
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:37,148
it did something to him inside.

20
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,353
But this was no time for feeling.

21
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,514
For when spared that baby's life,

22
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:17,564
he put his name at the top
of his own clan's death list.

23
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:22,287
With nothing but the clothes on his
back and the baby in his arms,

24
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:27,718
he decided to pay a visit to an old
warrior friend in a faraway land.

25
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,516
Hey, Johnny.

26
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,857
I don't like your stinking face.

27
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:08,936
Easy, Ronald.

28
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:12,614
The name's Eight-Ball.
Like in the game.

29
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:14,942
Good luck for some,
bad luck for others.

30
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:18,654
How can I assist you,
my friend from the mystical East?

31
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,954
Uh-oh.

32
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,715
Haven't been here
since Smiley kicked the bucket.

33
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,132
Was a 3-day wait
just to get your shirts pressed.

34
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,888
For a guy who cleaned sheets all day,
he sure liked to make a mess

35
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:47,474
in the after-hours,
if you know what I mean.

36
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,484
See you in the morning.

37
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,503
You came to me to be strong.

38
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,888
I have made you the strongest.

39
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,514
She will always be the enemy.

40
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,740
Here it is.

41
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,864
Just rub some on your shoulder.

42
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,781
Smiley's Oriental cure-all.
Works like a charm.

43
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,741
Now, honey, I didn't forget about you.

44
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,047
It's alright there. It's okay.
Ssh, ssh, ssh.

45
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:38,423
Sorry about the tap I gave you.
I thought you knew the sword.

46
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:43,507
Smiley was always yabbering on about
a guy who was going to roll into town.

47
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:48,186
But I should have figgered.
What do you call her?

48
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:49,888
I do not know.

49
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:52,315
Oh. She's not yours?

50
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:54,484
Where's her folks?

51
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:56,562
Dead.

52
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,037
Oo-ee, best we find you another diaper.

53
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,368
Alright.

54
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,005
Smiley like your uncle or something?

55
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:17,832
Friend.

56
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:21,215
Well, if you were his friend,
maybe he would like for you

57
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,587
to take over his laundry.

58
00:11:22,587 --> 00:11:26,425
- Do not know how.
- So I will teach you.

59
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:28,475
I always done the laundry around here.

60
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:31,020
That's how I repaid Smiley
for teaching me the sword.

61
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,814
Tell you what I am going to do.

62
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:37,110
You stay here, I will teach you how
to tie a diaper properly.

63
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,439
We will be partners, 60:40.
You are the 40.

64
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,737
Alright now, time to get to work.

65
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,407
Dang, you're slower
than molasses in January.

66
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,485
You clean that real good, yellow boy.

67
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:21,733
As clean as Snow White's panties....

68
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:26,818
If I find the smallest bit
of condor crap on my fancy duds...

69
00:12:26,818 --> 00:12:31,452
Well, we going to have us....

70
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:34,579
Didn't I tell you I'd rip them off
if you don't watch yourself?

71
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:35,706
Let go, evil midget.

72
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:38,129
Come on, Eight-Ball,
we were just having us some fun.

73
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:40,457
- Really?
- Ah.

74
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:44,043
Okay... okay...
Let go.

75
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,675
Get out of here.

76
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,811
How about a home-cooked meal
for you and your little'un?

77
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:02,403
Once that Ferris wheel is finished,
it's going to bring everybody rushing back,

78
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:06,028
And then we can take the word
"travelling" out of "travelling circus."

79
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:07,734
Hey, Ron.

80
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:11,572
Welcome to the
Eighth Wonder of the World.

81
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:13,952
Get down here.
The chow bell ringing.

82
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,748
Ha.

83
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,131
Bravo, bravo.

84
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,565
Going to grab some vittles with us?

85
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:22,892
No thanks.
Not hungry.

86
00:14:22,892 --> 00:14:26,696
I-I-I b-baked a cake.

87
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,114
Come on, Ron.

88
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:35,038
What the hell's up with her?

89
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,961
You, I knew you was trouble the moment
you walked into this....

90
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,780
Sounds even better from inside.

91
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,332
You ever seen one of these before?

92
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:08,502
The sound it's making?
It's called "opera."

93
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:12,177
Day my poppa found his first chunk
of gold,

94
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:14,637
he went out and bought this thing.

95
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,641
Listen.
Here's my favorite part.

96
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:02,598
So at the edge of the desert,
in a busted town full of broken people,

97
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:08,558
the warrior began to learn stuff
he should have learned a long time ago.

98
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,488
No, no. Rough.

99
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,785
Like the joy
of getting dirty things clean.

100
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,175
Yes.

101
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,936
Woo hoo. That's me.
Thank you.

102
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:51,688
I told you to aim at the line,
not at the coin.

103
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:52,859
All right.

104
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:55,984
He also learned the joy of losing.

105
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:59,408
You're going to need blood and bone of
about 100 dead buffaloes as fertilizer.

106
00:17:59,408 --> 00:18:01,781
Smiley always tried
to get something to grow.

107
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,533
Never, ever lasted too long.

108
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,705
He learned you could be happy
working with folks.

109
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,343
And finding the simple peace
in some private time

110
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:19,842
after a hard day's work.

111
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,140
What's taking you so long?

112
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,192
Come on, Skinny.
You going to miss it. Come on.

113
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,040
And he found that it's nice
to have a few friends around

114
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,046
when the sun goes down.

115
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:09,604
But most of all, the warrior learned
there's a heck of a lot more pleasure

116
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:13,774
making things grow
than there is in cutting them down.

117
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,321
You bunch of pups.
Give me back that goddamn bottle.

118
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,091
You win.
Show me what you got.

119
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,306
Goddamn.
I should have never taught you this game.

120
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:47,384
You a shark with a poker face.

121
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,741
What happened to her?

122
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,687
Please.
Help me.

123
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:42,646
- Help me.
- Lynne.

124
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:45,984
- Please. Let her go.
- Someone, help me.

125
00:20:45,984 --> 00:20:48,911
- Eight-Ball.
- Lynne.

126
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,457
Hungry?

127
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,052
No?

128
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,074
Pretty thing.

129
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,103
Aagh.

130
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:06,280
Agh. Aah.

131
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,787
Damn you.

132
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:42,581
Noooo.

133
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,661
No. Lynne. Lynne.

134
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,872
Agh.

135
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,553
No.

136
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,062
No.

137
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,457
Only thing was,
when we went to bury her,

138
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:41,954
she was still breathing.

139
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,625
Never known nobody
that close to kicking it.

140
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:52,674
We didn't know what to do with her,
if'n she was going to live or die.

141
00:23:52,674 --> 00:23:56,257
So we just put her in bed and waited.

142
00:23:56,257 --> 00:23:59,185
Two days, and she was eating soup.

143
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:02,354
By the day three, she was already
sitting up somehow....

144
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:04,477
and slinging daggers at the wall.

145
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,647
But God ain't fair.

146
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:11,071
And some people
just ain't cut out for the knife.

147
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,929
Dang it.
My arm ain't worth a damn.

148
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,678
It is not your arm.

149
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,809
What'd you say?

150
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:49,564
Ouch.

151
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,859
Now you sure about this?

152
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,658
Because I am not so good
with my eyes open.

153
00:24:56,658 --> 00:24:57,378
Throw.

154
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,203
I can't do it.

155
00:25:07,203 --> 00:25:10,130
Do not talk. Focus.

156
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,424
It is your heart that shakes.

157
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,606
You dead?

158
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:28,899
Not yet.

159
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,748
Sure you're not fountaining blood
or anything, are you?

160
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,214
Oh, shit.

161
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:09,901
Ha.

162
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,397
I did it.

163
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,232
Thank you,
Mr. Sad Flute.

164
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,910
Smiley told me everything.

165
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,034
I just taught you to focus.

166
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,719
Why you do that?

167
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,217
Okay.
I have always been dying to know.

168
00:27:26,217 --> 00:27:28,267
Why are you all called The Sad Flutes?

169
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,352
So you got lady Sad Flutes, too?

170
00:27:36,352 --> 00:27:38,732
Sad Flutinas or something?

171
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,612
Yes.

172
00:27:42,612 --> 00:27:45,820
Wow. That's nice.

173
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,327
Jumping in the moonlight and kissing

174
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:53,502
as you both fly under the stars
to the tunes of The Sad Flutes....

175
00:27:53,502 --> 00:27:59,175
We are called Sad Flutes
because when you cut the throat,

176
00:27:59,175 --> 00:28:02,628
the last sound is like a sad flute.

177
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:05,885
Dang.

178
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:10,140
Skinny, sure know how to throw a dead
cat into a party room, don't you?

179
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,855
Why'd you become a Sad Flute?

180
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,482
To be strong.

181
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:24,783
That it?

182
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,660
My father was working in the field.

183
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,245
I was helping him.

184
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,209
A swordsman came.

185
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:42,884
Killed my father.

186
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:46,213
Just to test his sword.

187
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,384
That must have hurt you something bad.

188
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:54,184
- Not hurt.
- Angry.

189
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,724
Of course you are.

190
00:28:56,724 --> 00:28:57,474
No.

191
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,779
I was angry at my father.

192
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,133
Here. Take it.

193
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:27,213
It's a present.
My momma gave it to me.

194
00:29:27,213 --> 00:29:32,097
She said, "If you hold it
over your heart when you're sad,

195
00:29:32,097 --> 00:29:34,428
it takes away all your sadness."

196
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,732
It works.

197
00:29:38,732 --> 00:29:40,275
Kind of.

198
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,275
Present?

199
00:29:44,275 --> 00:29:46,106
Yeah.

200
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,514
That is your only friend here.

201
00:30:11,514 --> 00:30:13,592
Take good care of it.

202
00:30:13,592 --> 00:30:15,223
Yes, master.

203
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,770
Oh, tarnations.

204
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,356
Only to protect, not kill.

205
00:30:27,356 --> 00:30:29,612
What am I going to kill in this town,
an armadillo?

206
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,241
Is that what I think it is?

207
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,468
You have sealed it.

208
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:54,800
So they cannot hear.

209
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,102
Hear what?

210
00:30:57,102 --> 00:30:58,554
The weeping.

211
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,438
Of all the souls I have taken.

212
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,106
Who's listening?

213
00:31:09,106 --> 00:31:10,066
My past.

214
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,324
And if it hears?

215
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,411
No more music.

216
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,795
This is a big country.
Where do we look?

217
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,801
Do not look.

218
00:31:36,801 --> 00:31:39,637
We listen.

219
00:31:39,637 --> 00:31:41,312
He will show.

220
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,054
Think of the sword as part of the body.

221
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,515
Like a finger.
Like a tooth.

222
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:29,899
Rather think of it like metal
slicing through a herd of buffalo.

223
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,696
Show me what Smiley taught you.

224
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,251
You do not have the power.

225
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:55,508
Well, thank you very much.
I did not know that.

226
00:32:55,508 --> 00:32:57,089
But you are fast.

227
00:32:57,089 --> 00:32:59,721
Just have to be faster.

228
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,102
Ouch.

229
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:08,480
Ouch. Is this because of yesterday?
Because I said I was sorry.

230
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,856
What? Cut it out, Skinny.
I am serious.

231
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:14,189
You are slower than molasses in January.

232
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:15,361
Come on, then.

233
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:16,441
Ah. Ouch.

234
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,946
Cut it out, Skinny.

235
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:23,793
Ow.

236
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,039
Stop it, Skinny.

237
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,462
Cut it out.
I am serious.

238
00:33:29,462 --> 00:33:30,712
Stop.

239
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,280
You bearded nut.

240
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,709
Merry Christmas, Laundry Man.

241
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:52,913
Merry Christmas.

242
00:34:52,913 --> 00:34:55,090
Merry Christmas.

243
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,969
Yeah.

244
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,020
We go.

245
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,164
May I have this dance?

246
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,713
Whose birthday?

247
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:38,758
Well... It's sort of a long story.

248
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,233
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

249
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,107
Hey, you young punks.

250
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,705
You going to take me for a spin
or what?

251
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,721
I win.

252
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:07,471
No.

253
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:14,267
Until your enemy's heart stops,
you have not won.

254
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,308
Is that so?

255
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,421
Did that stop your heart?

256
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,219
Ha. That's better.

257
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,601
Merry Christmas.

258
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:27,938
I didn't get my invitation.

259
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,361
Has anyone seen it?

260
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:32,321
No? Huh.

261
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,248
Never mind.

262
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,619
We're all here now.

263
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,921
No harm done.

264
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,840
Ho, ho, ho.

265
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:02,931
And what did Santa bring you,
little boy? Huh?

266
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:08,319
Why... if it ain't a clown.

267
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,947
You're looking so sad.
Huh.

268
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,993
You know, I never found clowns
that funny myself.

269
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:04,083
Don't worry, clown.
I am a pretty good shot.

270
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:06,331
Especially when I have been drinking.

271
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,514
Hey.

272
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,936
Don't go wasting good moonshine.

273
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:30,610
Wow.
This shit's smoother'n a calf's ass.

274
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,115
But this... this party's for girls.

275
00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:38,818
Let's all go to the spilloon.

276
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:40,744
What have we here?

277
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,494
Looks like we got ourselves
another clown.

278
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,833
Take this clown for a walk.

279
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:27,871
Never quite understood
the attraction of a circus.

280
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,838
Till now.

281
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,938
Join the others in Stockton.
I will catch you up.

282
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,021
Hyah. Hyah.

283
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,777
Gentlemen, I have a few old memories
I'd like to revisit.

284
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:01,200
Follow me.

285
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,512
Dang it.
He killed my whole family.

286
00:43:28,512 --> 00:43:32,019
Goddamn it, Baptiste,
let me go or I swear I am going to....

287
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:34,601
I-I-I am sorry, Lynne.
Lynne.

288
00:43:34,601 --> 00:43:36,651
This ain't just for your protection,
you know.

289
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:38,646
It's for the whole goddamn town.

290
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,026
Let me see.

291
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,409
We have a winner.
Gentlemen?

292
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:16,084
Maria.

293
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:26,546
He is your, uh... marido?

294
00:45:26,546 --> 00:45:28,381
My apologies.

295
00:45:28,381 --> 00:45:33,436
I am not the kind of man
who sleeps with a married woman.

296
00:45:33,436 --> 00:45:34,728
No.

297
00:45:34,728 --> 00:45:37,932
Por favor.
Gracias, Senor.

298
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,771
Mommy. No.

299
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:45,867
Oh.

300
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,078
But their daughters...

301
00:45:50,078 --> 00:45:52,029
Oh, that's a completely different matter.

302
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:54,160
Clean them up.

303
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,994
You get a bullet in the head
for every louse I find.

304
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,515
I once strung a man up
by his own hamstrings

305
00:46:19,515 --> 00:46:21,601
because he cooked me a steak well-done.

306
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,984
What?

307
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:29,488
Find that funny?

308
00:46:29,488 --> 00:46:31,364
Or is it because of this?

309
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,576
Thank you, gentlemen.

310
00:46:38,576 --> 00:46:41,959
This girl says she will serve herself
up to you instead of the spics.

311
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,835
Have we, uh, met before?

312
00:46:47,835 --> 00:46:51,138
No. We haven't.

313
00:46:51,138 --> 00:46:55,685
This is bound to be a night
you will never forget.

314
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,653
You have good teeth.

315
00:47:06,653 --> 00:47:09,357
I like that.

316
00:47:09,357 --> 00:47:13,115
Colonel, as you unwrap me,

317
00:47:13,115 --> 00:47:16,493
I am sure you will find
there's a whole lot more of me to like.

318
00:47:16,493 --> 00:47:19,041
I have no doubt of that.

319
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:20,709
And though I may be young,

320
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:23,788
I was hoping you could teach me
a thing or two.

321
00:47:23,788 --> 00:47:26,169
Life's best lessons tend to hurt.

322
00:47:26,169 --> 00:47:29,969
Sharp pain can bring sharp pleasure.

323
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,265
Tell them to get.
This ain't the theatre.

324
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:43,437
Gentlemen, you heard the lady.
Make yourselves scarce.

325
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,223
Lynne.

326
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,833
She's not here.

327
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:25,517
Now I, I might say some things during.

328
00:48:25,517 --> 00:48:29,650
Feel free to answer if you like.

329
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,909
Nothing is too wrong.

330
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:40,327
I have been waiting my whole life
for a place....

331
00:48:40,327 --> 00:48:42,124
where it's right to be wrong.

332
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:54,300
You know, I don't think any part
of the body is dirty or bad.

333
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,928
Just as long as it's well-scrubbed

334
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,386
Yes.

335
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,845
Assemble.

336
00:49:36,845 --> 00:49:38,388
Now.

337
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:46,431
Now where do you plan
to begin the inspection?

338
00:49:46,431 --> 00:49:50,268
I like where the skin creases...

339
00:49:50,268 --> 00:49:51,977
Go on.

340
00:49:51,977 --> 00:49:55,235
Between your nice... big...

341
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:02,120
Moment I smelt your neck...

342
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,371
...it all came flooding back.

343
00:50:05,371 --> 00:50:09,750
No girl could ever smell as sweet.

344
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:16,840
You changed it all.
My world.

345
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,800
My face.

346
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:23,259
You changed my life, little girl.

347
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:28,143
And now I am....
I am going to change yours.

348
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:49,877
That certainly is a beautiful scar
I gave you.

349
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,839
A hard-on for a scar.

350
00:50:56,839 --> 00:51:00,046
Now that is wrong.

351
00:51:00,046 --> 00:51:02,096
Oops.

352
00:51:02,096 --> 00:51:04,300
I forgot.

353
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,636
Nothing tonight is wrong.

354
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:19,907
Tell the cook to fry up some potatoes

355
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,247
And while we're waiting,
I thought I should give you

356
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:35,877
what I was so generously offering
ten years ago.

357
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,093
Enjoy the show.

358
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,394
No. He's mine.

359
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,591
- Lynne...
- Are you all right?

360
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,506
Cover me.

361
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,263
Hold on.

362
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,557
Lynne.

363
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,463
Agh.

364
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,031
Pull it off.

365
00:53:25,031 --> 00:53:28,907
- She got the wrong guy.
- That ain't him.

366
00:53:28,907 --> 00:53:30,988
Oh, God help us.

367
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:33,699
Merry Christmas.

368
00:53:33,699 --> 00:53:37,412
Sweet mother of God,
it's a goddamn butcher shop in here.

369
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,774
I must go
or you will all be in danger.

370
00:54:44,774 --> 00:54:47,447
We're in danger already.

371
00:54:47,447 --> 00:54:49,320
Colonel's on the loose.

372
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,118
That's right.
Lynne here smoked the wrong guy.

373
00:54:52,118 --> 00:54:55,198
Now the Colonel's coming back, and
he's bringing the whole damn family.

374
00:54:55,198 --> 00:54:58,500
We need the guy who did
that butcher job in the saloon.

375
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,124
Well, I say
we all just pack up and leave.

376
00:55:01,124 --> 00:55:03,627
He's right. If you stay and fight,
you will die like rats.

377
00:55:03,627 --> 00:55:05,878
Well, we will die like rats with rifles.

378
00:55:05,878 --> 00:55:07,425
What rifles?

379
00:55:07,425 --> 00:55:10,129
You got a Chink with a sword
and a bunch of juggling idiots.

380
00:55:10,129 --> 00:55:13,762
- How dare you?
- That ain't all we got.

381
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:16,479
Hey.

382
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,559
Beth will understand.

383
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:25,819
Follow me.

384
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:51,258
I ruined everything.
Didn't I?

385
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:55,132
You did what you had to do.

386
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:02,185
You could have just grabbed April
and hit the trail.

387
00:56:02,185 --> 00:56:04,312
But you didn't.

388
00:56:04,312 --> 00:56:08,988
Knowing saving me would ruin
every new thing you found here.

389
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:16,078
This New World, without you...

390
00:56:16,078 --> 00:56:18,450
...not so new.

391
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:28,837
Hey, let's say somehow they all come
and go and we're still breathing.

392
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,171
You're still going to leave, right?

393
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,467
That is the plan.

394
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:41,939
Um...

395
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,895
Maybe I could go with you?

396
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,572
Just think about it, alright?

397
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,373
Hey.

398
00:57:47,373 --> 00:57:49,921
That's my primo cactus juice.

399
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:23,281
Yee-haw. Whoo.

400
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,662
I knew what you was from the get-go.

401
00:58:30,662 --> 00:58:33,920
Don't need to look
at the size of a man.

402
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,343
I can smell the blood.

403
00:58:36,343 --> 00:58:38,512
It was on you, too.

404
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:42,428
Yeah.

405
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,142
Good.

406
00:58:48,142 --> 00:58:50,895
Now, get my jacket clean if you can.

407
00:58:50,895 --> 00:58:54,103
If I am going to die,
I want to look good doing it.

408
00:58:54,103 --> 00:58:55,903
Why die?

409
00:58:55,903 --> 00:58:58,824
Because we only got about a hundred
sticks of dynamite and a few weapons.

410
00:58:58,824 --> 00:59:02,698
That ain't much more'n to sting them with.

411
00:59:02,698 --> 00:59:04,871
You also have that.

412
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:31,273
Done a good job on this garden.
Well, for a laundry man.

413
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:36,649
You do a good shooting.

414
00:59:36,649 --> 00:59:39,732
For a drunken man.

415
00:59:39,732 --> 00:59:41,487
Why you stopped the shooting?

416
00:59:41,487 --> 00:59:47,369
Well, I just went around
robbing banks, hitting trains

417
00:59:47,369 --> 00:59:53,079
till I ran into the only force
that can truly bring down any outlaw.

418
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:55,164
Sheriff?

419
00:59:55,164 --> 00:59:55,884
Woman.

420
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:02,470
When I was with her,
I didn't want to run.

421
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:07,892
What happened then?

422
01:00:07,892 --> 01:00:11,722
There was a couple of Rangers
who hadn't forgot about me.

423
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:17,107
They ambushed me.

424
01:00:17,107 --> 01:00:19,188
Bullets flying everywhere.

425
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,816
One of them found Beth.

426
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:29,748
Last thing she ever said to me was,
"Don't never pick up no gun again."

427
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:31,916
So far...

428
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,546
Well, at least till today...

429
01:00:36,546 --> 01:00:38,624
I done what she asked.

430
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:46,014
But for fellas like me and you,
we are what we are.

431
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:53,848
If you truly love something
or somebody, Laundry Man...

432
01:00:53,848 --> 01:00:57,855
you get as far away
from them as possible.

433
01:00:57,855 --> 01:01:01,780
Because we're sand.

434
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,650
They're flowers.

435
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,474
These are yours.

436
01:01:30,474 --> 01:01:32,518
These are to kill.

437
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,068
Come.

438
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,283
Closer.

439
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,628
Here.

440
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,643
Here.

441
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:19,943
Here.

442
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,563
Remember these places.

443
01:02:24,563 --> 01:02:27,115
Fastest way to kill your enemy.

444
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:55,094
I will remember.

445
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,504
Company charge.

446
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:14,076
Oh...

447
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:17,806
Hey.

448
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,511
What the hell? Agh.

449
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,766
Come on.

450
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,530
Whoo.

451
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,700
Get up there.
Everybody, up there.

452
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:14,792
Come on men. Agh.

453
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,680
Get him, down there.

454
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,313
Get down.

455
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:42,861
Shoot them.

456
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:02,888
Ah.

457
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:28,991
Okay, let's get out of here.

458
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:38,792
Shoot them.

459
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,630
Shit.

460
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:46,383
Dynamite.
Run for your lives.

461
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:48,760
Take cover.

462
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:52,569
Ya-hoo.

463
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:40,103
Shit. We did it.

464
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,899
They hit Jacques.

465
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,368
Come on.
Back to town.

466
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,996
Come on.

467
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:59,707
Let's close this damn circus down.
Burn it.

468
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:03,502
Come on.

469
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:09,488
Kill.

470
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:29,838
Run.

471
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:54,112
Hey, come on.
Into the hotel.

472
01:12:54,112 --> 01:12:55,488
Keep low.

473
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:08,881
Get them.

474
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,227
Here. Take her.

475
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:33,858
Skinny.

476
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,967
I-I couldn't protect April.

477
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,650
Guard the hallway.

478
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:25,282
And don't let a damn soul
into this room.

479
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,328
What the....

480
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:38,813
Agh.

481
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,912
One more step, and she's soup.

482
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:01,840
I said stop.

483
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,363
Yah.

484
01:19:55,363 --> 01:19:56,363
Agh.

485
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:02,920
That sure is a purty scar I gave you.

486
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:11,007
Agh. Ooh.

487
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:14,180
Ooh. Ugh.

488
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:51,423
I will see you in Hell, little girl.

489
01:20:51,423 --> 01:20:55,426
Wear something nasty.

490
01:20:55,426 --> 01:20:56,848
Yaah.

491
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:31,751
Is this the new life you have found?

492
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,426
Funny.

493
01:21:36,426 --> 01:21:39,634
Look much like the old one.

494
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:51,229
Do you think you will tell her
that you kill her mother,

495
01:21:51,229 --> 01:21:56,443
her father and her entire clan?

496
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,826
She is the enemy.

497
01:22:00,826 --> 01:22:06,001
She will always be the enemy.

498
01:22:06,001 --> 01:22:11,754
You came to me to be strong.

499
01:22:11,754 --> 01:22:15,803
I have made you the strongest.

500
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:21,300
Kill her now.

501
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:26,059
You do not belong here.

502
01:22:26,059 --> 01:22:27,481
I do.

503
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:32,315
I did.

504
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:23,847
You have the perfect body
for an assassin

505
01:24:23,847 --> 01:24:25,845
but the heart of a priest.

506
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:38,021
Your heart will become
your biggest enemy.

507
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:56,546
You must kill your biggest enemy.

508
01:24:56,546 --> 01:24:58,794
We are assassins.

509
01:24:58,794 --> 01:25:02,753
All that we love, we will destroy.

510
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:27,494
You are assassin.

511
01:25:27,494 --> 01:25:32,166
All that you love, you will destroy.

512
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:40,209
Did we win?

513
01:27:40,209 --> 01:27:43,039
We survived.

514
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:44,794
Some of us.

515
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:50,712
I am not going with you.
Am I?

516
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:47,610
I guess that's the end of them.

517
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:48,857
No.

518
01:28:48,857 --> 01:28:51,656
It is just the beginning.

519
01:28:51,656 --> 01:28:55,031
What about the baby?
She going to be safe?

520
01:28:55,031 --> 01:28:59,330
They are listening for this to cry.

521
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:03,080
Not her.

522
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:20,556
That's right, Sand Man.

523
01:29:20,556 --> 01:29:22,387
Keep walking.

524
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:31,028
The warrior walked away.

525
01:29:31,028 --> 01:29:33,823
And legend has it,
he never stopped walking,

526
01:29:33,823 --> 01:29:38,870
always making sure to keep
as much distance as possible

527
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:43,951
between himself
and the little gal he loved.

528
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:29,499
How much?

529
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:40,845
Free.

530
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,114
Best watched using Open Subtitles MKV Player
