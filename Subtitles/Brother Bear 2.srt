1
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,327
<i>Waking up in the light</i>

2
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,319
<i>Of a shiny new day</i>

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,803
<i>Giving thanks to the moon</i>
<i>for guiding my way</i>

4
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,282
<i>There is no greater gift to the soul</i>

5
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,764
<i>Than each breath</i>
<i>that my body can hold</i>

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,163
<i>So, great spirits</i>

7
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,723
<i>Hear my voice today</i>

8
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,165
<i>Welcome, magic</i>

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,848
<i>Welcome, sweet sun ray</i>

10
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,002
<i>Love is no secret</i>

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,930
<i>Look all around you</i>

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,688
<i>Welcome to this day</i>

13
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,485
Whoa!

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,399
Look out! She's after us, eh!

15
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,999
- Oh, jeez.
- You gotta help us!

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,571
- You gotta hide us, eh.
- Oh, jeez. Too late. Here she comes!

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,359
I told you that was no moosette.

18
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,010
Well, she looked like one from behind.

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,891
What's gotten into you two?

20
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,879
- Well, it's that time of year, eh.
- Spring fever.

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,211
Spring what?

22
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,045
- Yeah, you know, like the birds.
- Yeah, and the bees.

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,488
And the moosettes. If you know what
we mean by moosettes.

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,759
Yeah, well, don't look now,
but your girlfriend's back.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,730
<i>Look all around you</i>

26
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,565
<i>Welcome, magic</i>

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,884
<i>Welcome, sweet sun ray</i>

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,611
<i>Love is no secret</i>

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,759
<i>Look all around you</i>

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,685
<i>Welcome to this day</i>

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,599
Awesome! Let's do it again.

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,080
Hey, Kenai.

33
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,886
- Hiya, Tug.
- Where y'all off to in such a hurry?

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,599
Crowberry Ridge.

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,090
We're gonna get dibs.

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,447
There's elderberries,
salmonberries, raspberries,

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,729
whortleberries, strawberries,
huckleberries, crowberries...

38
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,690
Hey, hey, slow down now.
That's a lot of berries.

39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,922
Yeah, there's plenty.
You wanna come with us?

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,890
Yoo-hoo! Tug!

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,919
Well, I'd love to, little Koda,
but can't keep the girls waiting.

42
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,604
Aw, who needs girls?

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,842
We're two footloose guys out on the tundra.

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,599
That's right. Kenai and Koda.
We don't need anybody else.

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,047
Okay, but you can't run from love.

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,361
Tug!

47
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,682
It has a way of tracking you down.

48
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,482
Hi, Hoonah.
You look mighty lovely today.

49
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,606
Did you see the look on Tug's face?

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,167
"Can't keep the girls waiting."

51
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,290
All right. How about we get some rest?

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,330
Rest? We've been hibernating
for six months.

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,329
- Who needs rest?
- Who needs rest?

54
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,126
A couple bears who are gonna beat all
the other bears to Crowberry Ridge.

55
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,687
And we're gonna get first dibs
on the berries, right?

56
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:39,920
Yeah, you bet.

57
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,804
- If you promise to go to sleep.
- Okay, okay.

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,124
I know all bears like berries,
but I love berries.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,525
Good night, Koda.

60
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,200
Are you a berry-liker or a berry-lover?

61
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,647
Good night, Koda.

62
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,687
Nita!

63
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,200
Kenai!

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,161
Whoo! Yeah!

65
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,808
- Race you to Hokani Falls!
- Wait up!

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,850
Here I come!

67
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,327
Nita!

68
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,725
Here.

69
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,403
We're always gonna be best friends, huh?

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,761
Huh?

71
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,770
Wow.

72
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,482
Nita, time to go!

73
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,130
Goodbye, Kenai.

74
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,690
See you!

75
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,769
Bye, Nita!

76
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,130
Bye, Nita.

77
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,007
Bye, Nita. Uh?

78
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,881
So, who's Nita?

79
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,086
Huh? What?

80
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,529
Did you know you talk in your sleep?
You were going, "Nita! Nita!"

81
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,765
So who's Nita?

82
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,326
She's a girl I used to know.

83
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,369
Whatever happened to her?

84
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,723
I don't know. I guess she grew up.

85
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,686
He's here! He's here!

86
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,481
- The groom is here!
- We must hurry. Let us prepare.

87
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,684
Hurry up! I wanna see him.
I wanna see Atka.

88
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,569
Nita, he's here!

89
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,162
They're here.
Prepare for the ceremonies.

90
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,846
He must have brought
his entire village with him.

91
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,399
Well, my sweet, this marriage
is extremely important.

92
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,679
That's why we came to help you get ready.

93
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,923
Oh, no, no. That's okay.
I can get myself ready.

94
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,601
Ah, go ahead. Use all the water.

95
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,091
Then we'll just air dry your hair.

96
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:22,050
Air dry? Certainly not.
Towel dry is shinier.

97
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,567
You know...

98
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,291
We'll put your hair up
to show off your beautiful eyes.

99
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,530
Up? No, down, of course,
to frame that beautiful face.

100
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,568
No, we're gonna put it up to show it off better.

101
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,728
- Down.
- Up.

102
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,290
- I'm gonna say down.
- Uh...

103
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,568
Oh, she's nervous. She needs to eat.

104
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,165
- I'll go get some smoked salmon.
- But I...

105
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,930
Salmon? On a nervous stomach?

106
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,640
She needs hackberry root steeped in rainwater.

107
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,767
In the morning? No!

108
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,569
No, no, I'm fine.

109
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,688
I think I'll feel better when I'm dressed.

110
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,326
Dressed?
I have just the outfit for you.

111
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,803
Oh, but you don't understand.
I already have one picked out.

112
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,281
Simple reindeer hide.
Slimming, yet elegant.

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,439
No, caribou. Feathers. Lots of beads.

114
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,363
- Beads? Are you nuts?
- Reindeer for a wedding?

115
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,085
- No more beads.
- Seashells, then.

116
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,239
- What is it with you and your seashells?
- I love seashells!

117
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,287
Hey!

118
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,042
I do believe I am feeling a bit hungry.

119
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,245
- I'll get the salmon.
- I'll get the tea.

120
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,209
Okay. Get plenty of both.

121
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,687
You look as beautiful in that dress
as your mother did on our wedding day.

122
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,279
Thanks, Daddy.

123
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,681
I wanted to wear something of hers today.

124
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,441
Oh, that means so much to me.
Your mother would be so proud.

125
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,964
I wish she was here.

126
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,209
Oh, she is.

127
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,770
In here.

128
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,851
Once you love someone,
they stay in your heart forever.

129
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,408
Are you ready to meet Atka?

130
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,691
Psst.

131
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,366
- Hmm?
- Mmm-hmm.

132
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,521
Great spirits, we come before you today

133
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,963
to bond this man and this woman as one.

134
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,361
We pray this pleases you.

135
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,001
Watch out!

136
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,041
Nita!

137
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,763
The spirits are trying to tell us something.

138
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:37,728
It must be a sign.

139
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,279
I don't understand.
How could this happen?

140
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,930
The villagers say it's a sign.

141
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,407
The villagers?
What the heck do they know?

142
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,285
Do you want the advice
of the villagers or a professional?

143
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,799
Oh, no, definitely a professional.

144
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,169
They say that in all the tribes,
you are the wisest shaman.

145
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,766
Sha-woman, okay?

146
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,606
"Wise" and "man" don't even belong
in the same sentence.

147
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,285
Let's get down to business.

148
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,448
So the ice cracked right out from under you.

149
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,889
Sure you haven't put on a few pounds?
Come on, girl to girl.

150
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,447
No, my weight's been constant.

151
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,007
Well, lucky you, Miss Constant Weight.

152
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,887
Tell you what.
Why don't we just ask the spirits, okay?

153
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,363
Hmm.

154
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,210
Uh-huh. Yeah.

155
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,770
What? What are they saying?

156
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:38,842
Don't interrupt. It ain't all about you.

157
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,167
Uh-huh.

158
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,651
They say...

159
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,323
You can't marry Ka-ka!

160
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,680
- Atka.
- Whatever.

161
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,282
The point is, you're already
matched up, Miss Two Timer.

162
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,290
Already matched up?
To whom?

163
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,085
To the one who gave you this.

164
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,331
Look at that picture.
That thing is crystal clear.

165
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,881
Kenai?

166
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,326
The bear boy?

167
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,762
Oh, no, no. We were just kids.

168
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,410
I've heard that one before.

169
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,211
Oh, there has to be a way to undo this.

170
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,001
Undo it?
You can't undo what's been done.

171
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,846
It's done. Case closed.
No more conversation. Ooh!

172
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,846
There is one way.

173
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,001
You must go and eat an ox!

174
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,127
What?

175
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,645
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

176
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,129
It's the equinox!

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,082
Does this place mean anything to you?

178
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,524
Hokani Falls?

179
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,681
That's where Kenai gave me the amulet.

180
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,169
You gotta go to Hokani Falls.

181
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,407
And on the eve of the equinox,

182
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,245
when the spirits change winter into spring,

183
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,842
you must burn the amulet

184
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,845
and send the bond back up to the ancestors!

185
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,764
You know, you might wanna
write some of this down.

186
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,563
The equinox is only three days away.
I have to get going.

187
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,730
Uh, with the person who gave you the amulet.

188
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,371
Kenai? But he's a bear.

189
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,367
Yeah?

190
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,327
You know, a bear?

191
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,890
Uh, I know what a bear is,
and I suggest you go look in the woods.

192
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,170
Well, even if I find him,
how will I talk to him?

193
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,040
Hmm. How will you talk to him?

194
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,089
Don't be afraid. It's in there.

195
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,249
That ain't it. Come on, try it again.

196
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,922
Ooh! I don't know what that was.
One more time.

197
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,482
And that mammoth stood there
watching the whole thing.

198
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,961
So I told Bucky, "The next time
you have to sneeze,

199
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,599
"please take the walnuts
out of your mouth first."

200
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,919
Oh, and then I started laughing so hard,
guess what came out of my nose.

201
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,003
Uh, Koda, speaking of food...

202
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,165
I know what you mean. All this walking
has made me crazy hungry.

203
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,925
Ha-ha!

204
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,279
Hey, watch it.

205
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,119
Hey! Whoa!

206
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,451
All right, step aside, kid,

207
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,522
and let a real bear show you
how the digging's done.

208
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,324
Sure it's easy now.
I gave you a head start.

209
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,805
Jackpot. All the roots
you can eat, buddy.

210
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,999
I knew I was onto something.

211
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,331
Oh, yeah, you did, huh?

212
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,839
Ah, what can I say?
I've got killer instincts.

213
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,171
Yeah, right.

214
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,324
Oh, hey, look, is this a tuber?

215
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,368
- Get down!
- What is it?

216
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,163
Quick, hide in here!

217
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,521
Aah!

218
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,761
Ahh!

219
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,561
Nita?

220
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,205
Ow!

221
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,520
Watch it!

222
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,644
Hey, no, Nita! It's me, Kenai.

223
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,371
Kenai?

224
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,086
Is it really you?

225
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,889
Yeah, it's really me.

226
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,291
Wow, I'd heard you were a bear,

227
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,410
I just didn't realise
you'd look so much like a bear.

228
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,927
Yeah, well, look at you.
You really changed.

229
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,006
Wait a minute. You can talk.
I mean, you can understand me?

230
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,529
Yeah. The spirits did it
so when I found you, I could talk to you.

231
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,565
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. You...
You've been looking for me? Why?

232
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,207
Well, this is why.

233
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,927
You've kept this? After all these years.

234
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,291
The great spirits told our shaman
that this amulet bonds us as one.

235
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,486
Really?

236
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,722
So now you and I have to go to Hokani Falls...

237
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,086
Together? Like when we were kids?

238
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,605
- ...and burn it.
- And burn it!

239
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,131
Burn it? What?

240
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,961
It's no big deal. It's only a little trinket.

241
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,644
Little trinket?

242
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,331
Uh, well, what I mean is,
we were just silly kids.

243
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,690
They won't let me get married
until it's destroyed.

244
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,803
Hmm. Let me think about this.

245
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,450
- Sorry, can't help you.
- What?

246
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,007
So, have fun burning
the silly little trinket on your own.

247
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,799
No, you don't understand.

248
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,999
We have to burn it together.
Otherwise, it won't work.

249
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,126
What won't work?

250
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,850
Uh, Nita, this is my brother, Koda.
Koda, Nita. Nita, Koda.

251
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,288
So you're Nita.
Kenai was just dreaming about you.

252
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,682
I was not.

253
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,679
Was too.
You should hear him. "Nita. Nita."

254
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,648
Well, it's been nice talking to you,

255
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,359
but Koda and I have big plans
to go to Crowberry Ridge.

256
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,359
Wait! You're just gonna walk away?

257
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,328
You're not gonna help me take care of this?

258
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,367
Nope.

259
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,808
You know, neither of us can get on
with our lives until we burn this amulet.

260
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,490
I'll take my chances.

261
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,646
Okay. Fine. Fine.

262
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,082
I guess I'll just wait for them
to turn you back into a human

263
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,288
and send you to find me.

264
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,684
Would they do that?

265
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,041
No. No, buddy, of course not.

266
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,327
Well, how do you know?

267
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,046
What if they did turn you back into a man?

268
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,362
Then we wouldn't be brothers any more.

269
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,682
No, Koda, it's... That's not...

270
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,321
Hmm.

271
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,208
Fine. Okay.
We'll go to Hokani Falls.

272
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,079
But right after that, buddy, just the two of us,

273
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,969
we'll race down to Crowberry Ridge.

274
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,520
- Pinkie swear?
- Pinkie swear.

275
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,488
Then it's settled. Ready?

276
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,087
As I'll ever be.

277
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,926
Um...

278
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,239
Hokani Falls is this way.

279
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,199
I knew that. I knew that.

280
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,204
No, he didn't.
Kenai has a lousy sense of direction.

281
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,281
That is not true.

282
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,725
One time, in the middle of the night,

283
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:52,290
he was trying to find our cave in the dark...

284
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,849
Course, when we met, he didn't know
the first thing about being a bear.

285
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,242
Like this one time,
we were hunting for pine nuts,

286
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,164
and he stuck his big head inside a hollow tree.

287
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,366
And I said, "You better not do that
'cause you don't know who lives there."

288
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,439
But he did, 'cause you can't tell Kenai nothing.

289
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,601
All right, Koda.

290
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:17,685
Next thing you know, he spent a whole
week smelling like a stinky skunk.

291
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,599
Something tells me
stinky skunk was an improvement.

292
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,763
I got a lot more stinky Kenai
stories, if you want to hear them.

293
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,491
- Okay, so, like, we gotta go, eh.
- We'll see you around, eh.

294
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,279
- So, we'll give you a call.
- Yeah, we'll catch you later.

295
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,439
Yeah, we gotta go work out.

296
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,761
Yeah. Gotta keep
these muscles real buff, eh.

297
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,919
So long!

298
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,002
- Hey, look, it's big bear.
- Beauty, eh.

299
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,481
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Boy, are we glad to see you, eh.

300
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:43,529
Yeah, 'cause we finally found a couple
of real moosettes, eh,

301
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,284
right down there by the stream.

302
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,600
Bye!

303
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,524
- Toodle-oo!
- So long!

304
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,160
Those guys are weird.

305
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,971
Don't look. You'll only encourage them.

306
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,849
But they won't give us the time of day, eh.

307
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,720
We was thinking maybe you could help
us with, you know, an opening line, like,

308
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,119
"Oh, hey, I see you like to eat twigs."

309
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,119
Or how about a sonnet, eh?

310
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,805
Like, "Shall I compare thee
to a summer's dew?"

311
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,163
Oh, jeez. Forget that brainy stuff, eh.
They're not owls.

312
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,799
I like, "Hey ladies, nice dewlaps.
Are those things real?"

313
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,926
Excuse me.

314
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,644
- Uh-oh. Oh, gee.
- Hunter. Hunter!

315
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:22,120
We're out of here! Bye!
Every moose for himself.

316
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,999
Oh!

317
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,411
Act like we're not here.

318
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,490
It's okay. This is Nita.
She's with me and Kenai.

319
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,641
- She is?
- Oh.

320
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,688
- Well, pleased to meet you, eh.
- How's it going, eh?

321
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,171
I'm Rutt, and this is my brother...

322
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,241
Kenai, what's the holdup?

323
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,244
We have to set up camp
on that far peak before sundown.

324
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,846
Oh, nice to meet you.

325
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,639
Scary, isn't she?

326
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,879
Let's go. We're running out of daylight.

327
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,043
Nita, calm down. We got plenty of time.

328
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,479
A smart traveller always allows
for unexpected delays.

329
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,324
Well, this won't be a delay
if you let me have a minute

330
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,603
to give these guys a little romantic advice.

331
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,321
Romantic advice? From you?

332
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,684
Stop kidding. Let's go.

333
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,324
Hmm. You know, boys, I think this calls
for more than just a good opening line.

334
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,847
It does?

335
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,565
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. Ahem.

336
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:20,521
Acts of bravery.
That's what really impresses the ladies.

337
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,041
Gee, eh, bravery sounds scary.

338
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,361
No, you just have to pretend to be brave.

339
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,364
- Yeah?
- I'll go out there, I'll act all ferocious,

340
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,561
and then you guys come over
the beaver dam and rescue them.

341
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,041
Oh. Okay. Yeah, yeah.
That's a beauty plan.

342
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,199
- He's smart, eh. Not like you.
- Oh, get out.

343
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,091
Kenai, we don't have time
for this. Kenai!

344
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,770
It's no use.

345
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,810
This falls under,
"You can't tell Kenai nothing."

346
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,165
What's wrong with him?

347
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,561
Maybe he got ahold of some bad salmon.

348
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,041
This is stupid.

349
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,968
This ought to impress the ladies for sure, eh.

350
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:04,121
Yeah.

351
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,331
I'm a big hungry bear,
and I'm gonna rip you to shreds! Roar!

352
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,082
I said I'm gonna rip you to shreds!

353
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,490
Uh-oh. Hey, I think that's our cue, eh.

354
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,606
- Yeah, beauty.
- Let's go.

355
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,439
Fear not, moosettes!

356
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,125
I, Tuke, and my brother, Rutt,
will save you, eh.

357
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,168
- Yeah!
- What ho, largish bear?

358
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,806
Touch not those fair moosette ladies, eh.

359
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,008
You's gonna have to go
through us if you want them.

360
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,367
Yeah. You'll have to kill us, eh.

361
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,439
- What? No, no, not kill us.
- Oh, sorry.

362
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,684
Uh, maybe not kill us, but just,
you know, push us down or something.

363
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,050
Roar!

364
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,159
Jeez, that was scary, eh.

365
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,003
Jeez. I thought
I was gonna wet my hooves.

366
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,526
You can go back to grazing.
Nothing to see here.

367
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,279
- Toodle-oo!
- Hey, wait!

368
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,487
Guys, where are you going?
Don't leave.

369
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,839
- This used to be such a quiet river, eh.
- Oh, yes.

370
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,242
- Let's get out of here.
- Nice rack on that little one, though.

371
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,846
Are you kidding?
All antler and no brain.

372
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,325
That went well.

373
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,846
Hey, Kenai.

374
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,521
I thought you were supposed to be scaring moose.

375
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,888
Do you think you can help me out here?

376
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,361
Do all his plans end
with his head stuck in something?

377
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:38,559
Most of them.

378
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,164
- Koda!
- Well, they do.

379
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,205
Calm down, Kenai.

380
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,006
We'll try to get you out of here.

381
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,801
Okay, let's see here.

382
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,725
Aah! Ohh!

383
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,485
Sure would be easier
if he didn't have such a fat head.

384
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,209
- Hi, Kenai.
- Hi, Koda.

385
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,931
Oh! Oh, no! My bag. My bag!
The amulet's in my bag!

386
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,840
It's floating right in front of you.
Just grab it!

387
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,723
Nita!

388
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,682
You get it. I can't. I can't.

389
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,167
It's right there! Kenai, get it.

390
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,885
I'm a little busy here.

391
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,602
It's getting away, Kenai!
Help! Get it! Get it!

392
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,806
Stop hitting...

393
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,161
Oh, no!

394
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,682
Oh! The amulet. Oh, there it is!

395
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,688
I guess this would qualify
as one of those unexpected delays.

396
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,921
Ah, there it is.

397
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,611
Oh, thank goodness.

398
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,605
Let's see what we got here.

399
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,083
Hey! Wait, that's my stuff.

400
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,401
Ooh!

401
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,087
You leave that alone. It's mine.

402
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,171
Ugh! Come on!

403
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,851
It's gone.

404
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,771
Ohh! The amulet is gone.

405
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,367
That's because there ain't a better thief
than the masked bandit.

406
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,124
Once they get something in their clutches,

407
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,202
you might as well give up all hope.

408
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,886
Nope, that amulet's as good as gone.

409
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,928
The Ice Age will end before you get it back.

410
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,959
Thanks a lot, Kenai.

411
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,803
- What did I do?
- This is all your fault!

412
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:38,847
My fault?

413
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,365
If you hadn't stopped to help those moose...

414
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,279
Whoa, whoa! You're the one
who destroyed an entire beaver dam.

415
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,363
I wouldn't have destroyed it if you
hadn't gotten your head stuck in it.

416
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,643
And I'm not the one who had the bag
in reach and then let it float away.

417
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,927
My head was stuck.
What's your excuse?

418
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,169
Oh, what am I gonna do now?

419
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,162
If I can't burn the amulet,
I'll never be able to marry Atka.

420
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,879
Kenai?

421
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,439
Nita, Nita, you gotta come quick.
You're not gonna believe it.

422
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,966
Kenai spent the whole night
untangling those tracks.

423
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,243
And I didn't think anybody could,
'cause they were all forks,

424
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,129
double-backs and crisscrosses
and dead ends...

425
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,208
Koda, Koda, where is Kenai?

426
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,921
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
He found the river bandit's hideout.

427
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,804
Show me.

428
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,890
Nita, Nita, over here.

429
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,806
Well, where is it? Did you get it?

430
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,924
Shh! I don't have it yet.

431
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:49,130
It's up in the tree.
I'm waiting for them to fall asleep.

432
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,168
- Nita, wait.
- Hey!

433
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,090
Nita, what are you doing?

434
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,010
I'm getting my amulet back.

435
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,571
Let me handle this.

436
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,688
I'm fine. I've got it covered.

437
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,365
No, seriously, you could fall.

438
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,642
I'm trying to concentrate.

439
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,921
Whoa!

440
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,721
Hey, hey!

441
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,767
Can't any of you morons
define the term "nocturnal"?

442
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,521
Anyone?

443
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,370
Sorry. Sorry.

444
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,927
It's completely my fault. Just me.

445
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,284
Uh, listen, you've got something of ours.

446
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,809
Yeah, it's round, about so big.

447
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,520
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

448
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,409
That's for me to know and for you to find out.

449
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,720
Either way, it's a moot point.

450
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,246
Finders keepers, losers weepers.
It's the way of the woods.

451
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,204
Hey, you didn't find it,
you stole it. Thief.

452
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,721
All right, you got me. That's what we do.

453
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,811
We rob from the rich
and give to the less fortunate.

454
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,803
You know, like us.

455
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,041
I don't think you wanna mess with Kenai.

456
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,359
He's a lean, mean,
raccoon butt-kicking machine.

457
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,088
Ow!

458
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,449
- Ahh!
- Go ahead!

459
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,879
Hit him with all you got. He can take it.

460
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,325
Koda, what are you doing?

461
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm tricking them into using
all their pine cones.

462
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,005
Ow! It's a pine forest.

463
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,399
Oh, right. This could take a while.

464
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,481
You think?

465
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,559
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, what about a trade?

466
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,451
Whoa, whoa! Hold your fire.
Hold it. Hold, hold. He wants to trade.

467
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,089
- Ooh, a trade.
- Whatcha got?

468
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,847
What do I got?
I got lots of things.

469
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,890
I got pine cones?

470
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,287
No!

471
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,088
Uh, how about this stick?

472
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,719
- No.
- Rock?

473
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,131
You are insulting me.

474
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,123
I can't believe it!

475
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,851
Shoo. Shoo. Come on.

476
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,008
Come on, let go.

477
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,926
Ohh...

478
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,845
Mama!

479
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,919
Uh...

480
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,001
Hi?

481
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,006
Nita, I think it's time to go!

482
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,091
Nita, behind you!

483
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,609
Whoa! She's not bad.

484
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,924
I got an idea. Come on.

485
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,441
Nita, go to the top.

486
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,200
What? I'm trying to get down.

487
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,642
Just listen to me! I know what I'm doing.

488
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,881
Hello!

489
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,962
I want what you took from me.

490
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,487
Yes, that's it. Keep going!

491
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,601
Let's get her.

492
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,685
Kenai!

493
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,961
Well, well. Nowhere to run to, baby,
nowhere to hide.

494
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,931
Nita, let go!

495
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,963
What? This is your plan?

496
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,487
Just trust me.

497
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,846
Don't listen to him.

498
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,685
Come on, be a smart little hunter girl, huh?

499
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,683
Hand over the trinket.

500
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,970
Kenai, this better work!

501
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,327
Catch me!

502
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,159
- That was a lot of raccoons.
- I can't believe I outran all of them.

503
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,766
- When you jumped out of that tree...
- Oh, oh! And the way you caught me!

504
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,046
And then when we fell...

505
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:06,849
You were amazing!

506
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,527
I'm just glad we finally got the old Nita back.

507
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,409
What do you mean, "the old Nita"?

508
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,210
The fun Nita.

509
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,204
Come on, you know you've been
kind of a stick in the mud this entire trip.

510
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,205
Okay, maybe you don't know.

511
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,527
It's just good to see you
loosen up a bit, you know?

512
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,210
Now hold on.

513
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,280
Ew! What stinks?

514
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,919
It's not me, Koda.

515
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,925
Ugh! That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever smelled.

516
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,047
Let's go check it out.

517
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,245
Hey! Wait a minute! I'm not finished.

518
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,204
Oh, brother, I have never known
a moose to take this long, eh.

519
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,039
Don't rush me.
I can't do it while you're watching.

520
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,327
- Jeez. You're getting it on my leg.
- Sorry.

521
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,559
- Oh, hey, largish bear.
- How's it going, eh?

522
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,562
- Are we glad to see you.
- Yeah, beauty.

523
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,927
We're still getting the brush-off
from those moosettes.

524
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,771
Yeah, they seem immune
to our rugged good looks, eh,

525
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,439
so we thought we'd appeal
to their olfactory senses.

526
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,487
Ew!

527
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,281
Yes, for example,

528
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,079
I'm wearing essence of wet leaf compost

529
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,401
- with just a hint of sandalwood.
- Ugh!

530
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,687
And I'm augmenting my natural moosely musk

531
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,366
with a blend of pine needles and river mud.

532
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,251
I got news for you, little brother.
That wasn't mud.

533
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,686
- Ugh!
- Gee, eh.

534
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,489
- Kind of overpowering?
- That's no good.

535
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,961
Guys, don't sweat it. I got another plan.

536
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,371
Oh, yeah.

537
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,770
I think we've all seen
your expertise on romance.

538
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,451
Yeah, very funny.
Don't we have an amulet to burn?

539
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,768
Oh, we can spare a moment.

540
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,611
- Beauty, eh.
- What you need here...

541
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,887
Excuse me.

542
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,327
Is a woman's point of view.

543
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,330
- Yeah?
- And a plan that actually works.

544
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,605
That's beauty, eh.

545
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,608
Hi! I'm playing with my two best friends,
and I need a place to hide.

546
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,484
Aw! Look at the sweet little thing.

547
00:33:59,485 --> 00:34:01,319
Jeez, I could just eat him up.

548
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,446
Hello...

549
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,327
- Psst. Go. Go. Get moving.
- Beauty, eh.

550
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,679
Good luck, eh.

551
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,286
- Rutt, would you get going?
- Okay.

552
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,880
Oh, uh, excuse us, ladies.

553
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,482
We're looking for our pal.

554
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,644
- Um, brownish?
- Why, yes.

555
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,246
- Furry?
- Yes, again.

556
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,089
- About yay big?
- That's him!

557
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,565
Haven't seen him.

558
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,641
Ha! Here I am.

559
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,401
I fooled you. I win.

560
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,324
- There's no beating you, little buddy.
- Look at that.

561
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,165
You're so good with him.

562
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,164
Oh, yeah, eh. We have lots
of little kid animal friends.

563
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,641
We know a little weasel and a little badger.

564
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,724
And we've even got some
little baby bunny friends.

565
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,159
Aw...

566
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,039
Whoa. Smallish bear
is like a babe magnet, eh.

567
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,601
Socialise.

568
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,321
So, would you ladies
be interested in grazing on some twigs?

569
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,722
Oh, no, thanks, we just ate. Ow!

570
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,361
We love twigs.

571
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,522
Really? Well, so do we.
Right, little brother?

572
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,369
Shall I compare thee to a summer's dew?

573
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,407
Oh, jeez.

574
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,201
Though it art more lovely
and more dewy than you.

575
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,528
- Oh, nice move, eh.
- What's wrong with him?

576
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,125
Don't mind my little brother.

577
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,407
He was trampled by an elk herd
when he was a calf.

578
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,561
Oh, jeez, that's awful.

579
00:35:12,562 --> 00:35:14,369
That's not true. It was only half a herd.

580
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,240
You're serious, right?

581
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,566
Smooth.

582
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,006
Um, remind me again
who's the better moose matchmaker.

583
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,241
Beginner's luck.

584
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,919
Jealous?

585
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,729
All right, that was a really nice thing...

586
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,643
Did you see me? I did it.

587
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,167
You can do pretty amazing things
with moose. That's great.

588
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,125
Huh? Hey, wait for me!

589
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,441
Oh, oh, Koda, be careful.

590
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,040
Relax, he's fine.
He's just looking for lunch.

591
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,081
Yeah. Besides, I'm always careful. Ow!

592
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,891
Oh, hey, we're making great time.

593
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,203
Look, see, we just go down this trail
until we hit the river.

594
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,324
- River?
- Yeah. And then we swim across.

595
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,759
Swim?

596
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,959
Then it's just a little ways to Hokani Falls.

597
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,530
We'll be there by lunchtime tomorrow.

598
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,245
Well, that's a good plan, but what about this?

599
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,290
We go up this ridge to that mountain,

600
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,123
climb up those cliffs,
walk across that snow bridge

601
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,924
and avoid the river altogether.

602
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,525
That makes more sense to me.

603
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,439
That doesn't make any sense.

604
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,922
That's way out of the way, and there's
too much up and not enough down.

605
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,925
- I vote for the river.
- Me too.

606
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,969
Two-to-one. We win. Let's eat.

607
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,610
- Well, it's my amulet.
- So?

608
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,246
And my wedding.

609
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,919
Well, then have your honeymoon up there,

610
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,160
'cause if we go that way now,

611
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:35,401
we'll have to walk all night
to make it to the falls in time.

612
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,091
Fine. Then I'll meet you there.

613
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,646
Nita, what's wrong with you?

614
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,683
Trust me.
My way will get us there before...

615
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,771
What's the matter with you?

616
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,883
You act like you're afraid of fish.

617
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,163
My gosh, Kenai, I can't believe it.

618
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,605
Hey, Kenai, watch this.

619
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,999
Where's the girl who's afraid of fish?

620
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,207
Hi, my name is Nita, and I'm afraid of fish.

621
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,128
I have a fish. The fish is so scary!
Oh, no, he's gonna eat me!

622
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,326
Ahem. Koda, come on.

623
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,645
- Koda, stop.
- No, he almost got me.

624
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:14,210
Koda, stop!

625
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,286
We were just kidding around about the fish.

626
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,484
No, it's not the fish.

627
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,882
It's the water.

628
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,167
Ever since that day I fell through the ice
when we were kids...

629
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,761
Oh...

630
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,960
I didn't realise.

631
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,086
That's why I didn't grab the bag in the river.

632
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,207
It wasn't your fault we lost the amulet.

633
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,931
It was mine.

634
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,283
Hey, we got it back together.
That's all that matters, right?

635
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,930
What are you looking at?

636
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,731
You ready to keep going?

637
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,408
But I'll never be able to cross that river.

638
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,290
We can do that together, too.

639
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,048
<i>Funny how it turns out</i>

640
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,759
<i>That everything can change</i>

641
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,765
<i>What I feel right now</i>
<i>is not the same as yesterday</i>

642
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,560
<i>There's more than I imagined</i>

643
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,882
<i>Deep inside my heart</i>

644
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,279
<i>Emotions that I never knew</i>

645
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,521
<i>And this is just the start</i>

646
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,239
<i>So many things</i>
<i>I've been missing not watching</i>

647
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,528
<i>But that was all in the past</i>

648
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,599
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to learn</i>

649
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,762
<i>I'm ready for the world</i>

650
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,003
<i>Not scared of letting go</i>

651
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,919
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to feel</i>

652
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,161
<i>And my heart knows it's real</i>

653
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,683
<i>The part of me so long-forgotten</i>

654
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,479
<i>Is calling, and this feels like home</i>

655
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,767
<i>Home, home</i>

656
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,759
<i>Feels just like home</i>

657
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,843
<i>Right from the start,</i>
<i>been friends forever</i>

658
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,205
<i>Somehow we're meant to be together</i>

659
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,999
<i>I feel like you've shown me</i>
<i>how to find my way home</i>

660
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,650
<i>Find my way home</i>

661
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,679
<i>Now I realise so much more to learn</i>

662
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,639
<i>I'm ready for the world</i>

663
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,927
<i>Not scared of letting go</i>

664
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,807
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to feel</i>

665
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,247
<i>And my heart knows it's real</i>

666
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,808
<i>The part of me so long-forgotten</i>

667
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,487
<i>Is calling, and this feels like home</i>

668
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,927
<i>Home, home</i>

669
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,367
<i>Feels just like home</i>

670
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,651
It's the only way.

671
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,206
Let me help you.

672
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,681
I changed my mind.

673
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,679
Nope, it's too late for that.
We're going across.

674
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,604
- Whatever happens, don't let go.
- Okay.

675
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,208
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to learn</i>

676
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,890
<i>I'm ready for the world</i>

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,362

679
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,723
<i>Part of me so long-forgotten</i>

680
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,083
<i>Is calling, and this feels like home</i>

681
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,202
I did it! I did it!

682
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,206
<i>This feels like home</i>

683
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,089
Thank you, Kenai.

684
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,039
<i>Home, home</i>

685
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:06,648
<i>Feels just like home</i>

686
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,207
Hey, smallish bear.
So where's big bear, eh?

687
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,325
With Nita.

688
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,609
He never has time for me any more.
He's too busy helping her.

689
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,004
Shee! Boy, do I know how you feel.

690
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,369
My own brother gave me the heave-ho,
eh, all for a babe.

691
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,240
Actually, two really, really hot babes.

692
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,771
Better watch your brother
doesn't walk out on you, eh.

693
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,410
He wouldn't do that.

694
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,004
I said the same thing, eh,

695
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,321
but get a load of Moose-anova
over there.

696
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,809
Shall I compare thee to a summer's dew?

697
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,439
Did you just make that up?

698
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,930
- Beauty, eh.
- He's such a poet.

699
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,411
Yeah, I guess I'll see you around, little bear.

700
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,771
- You had a whole clumpful.
- Oh, you're making that up.

701
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,730
All I know is I had all my fur
when we went into the river,

702
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,370
and two handfuls were missing when we came out.

703
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,799
- Well, maybe you're just going bald.
- What?

704
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,963
You know, it does look
really thin right through here.

705
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,083
Yeah, very funny.

706
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,519
This is the most fun I've had
since we were kids.

707
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,368
Fun but cold.

708
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,727
On a night like this, it's good to be a bear.

709
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,451
I bet.

710
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,005
So, Hokani Falls.

711
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,211
I guess we'll make it there in time, huh?

712
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,326
I guess.

713
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,970
A lot sure has changed
since the last time we were there.

714
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,171
No kidding.

715
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,049
Do you ever miss being human?

716
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,165
I mean, have you ever thought about
changing back?

717
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,325
Yeah, I've...

718
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,879
I've thought about it.

719
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,006
I knew it.

720
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,927
Koda.

721
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,886
You're going back with her.

722
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,411
Koda, wait. Koda, wait!

723
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,887
Koda!

724
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,010
Koda, answer me!

725
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,881
Koda!

726
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,046
Hello?

727
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,691
Koda? Are you in here?

728
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,890
Where are you?

729
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,370
Koda?

730
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,407
Koda?

731
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,245
Go away.

732
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,203
Koda, Kenai's worried sick about you.
Come on, I'll take you to him.

733
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,522
No! I said go away!

734
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,688
Koda, please keep your voice down.
It's not safe.

735
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,001
I don't care. Just leave me alone.

736
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,566
No, Nita!

737
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,483
We're gonna be all right, but we've got to go.

738
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,801
Now!

739
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,483
Run! Run! Run! Faster!

740
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,765
We're gonna make it.

741
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,802
- Nita!
- Take my hand.

742
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,081
Don't move.

743
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,367
Koda!

744
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,846
Hang on!

745
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,681
Nita!

746
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,847
Don't let go!

747
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,927
- Koda, hold on!
- I am!

748
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,680
Koda.

749
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,840
Koda, what would I have done
if anything happened to you?

750
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,681
You're gonna leave me.
You said you missed being one of them.

751
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,001
You're going back with her, aren't you?

752
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,290
I do miss things,

753
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,245
but you're my brother.

754
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,929
I'll never leave you.

755
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,091
Ah. Not ever.

756
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,959
Ah, this show's giving me the munchies, eh.

757
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,327
Hey, little brother,
how about you get us some twigs, eh?

758
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,647
Okay.

759
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,325
Are you crying?

760
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,766
No. I mean, well, yeah, but so what, eh?

761
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,327
These lights are so beautiful, eh, I...

762
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,803
Oh, he's sensitive.

763
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,764
A moose with depth?

764
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,969
It's beauty, eh.

765
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,606
What?

766
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,359
He's a cute one, isn't he?

767
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,647
Hey, I can be sensitive, too, eh.

768
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,650
Ooh, I like your hooves.

769
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,839
Really?

770
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,765
Yeah, and I'm a hoof man.
Yours are nice and shiny.

771
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,331
Hoof man? Why didn't I think of that?

772
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,929
Is this the equinox?

773
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,571
Yeah, Koda, this is it.

774
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,449
My mom is up there somewhere.

775
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,850
My mom, too.

776
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,007
Do you miss yours?

777
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,446
Yes.

778
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,610
But you don't need to wait for the lights
to find her, Koda.

779
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,444
She's always with you.

780
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,731
In here.

781
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:25,324
Once you love someone,
they stay in your heart forever.

782
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,610
It's time.

783
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,924
Koda, you be good, okay?

784
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,602
You're such a sweet little cub.

785
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,886
Oh, the spell.

786
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,365
Goodbye.

787
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,521
<i>If you hear a voice</i>

788
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,845
<i>In the middle of the night</i>

789
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,041
<i>Saying it'll be all right</i>

790
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,566
<i>It will be me</i>

791
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,806
<i>If you feel a hand</i>

792
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,091
<i>Guiding you along</i>

793
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,530
<i>When the path seems wrong</i>

794
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,640
<i>It will be me</i>

795
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,250
<i>There is no mountain</i>

796
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,171
<i>That I can't climb</i>

797
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,648
<i>For you, I'd swim through</i>
<i>the rivers of time</i>

798
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:53,009
<i>As you go your way and I go mine</i>

799
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,604
<i>Our light will shine</i>

800
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,369
<i>And it will be me</i>

801
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,003
<i>It will be me</i>

802
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:15,091
<i>It will be me</i>

803
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,804
Kenai, did you give Nita the amulet
because you loved her?

804
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,204
It was a long time ago.

805
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,963
But she's still with you in here.

806
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,205
I can tell.

807
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,649
Ah, Koda, it doesn't matter.

808
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,681
Well, if you do love her,
shouldn't you tell her?

809
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,404
It's a little more complicated than that.

810
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,690
Anyway, it's over.

811
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,931
Hey, I promised you we'd be the
first two bears to Crowberry Ridge.

812
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,443
Pinkie swear, remember?

813
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,722
How about first thing in the morning,
we rustle up some more berries?

814
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,006
Sound good?

815
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,644
Mom, Kenai's so sad.

816
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,849
It's all because of me.

817
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,882
I'll be okay on my own.

818
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,445
Tell the spirits to change Kenai back
so he can be happy.

819
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,403
- Jeez, he's really out, eh.
- Yeah.

820
00:55:14,404 --> 00:55:16,439
Maybe we should throw some water on his face.

821
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,727
Why don't you just stand
there drooling, eh? That should do it.

822
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,847
Trample off.

823
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,928
Oh, wait. Hey, I think I saw him move.

824
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,562
Rise and shine, bear boy!

825
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,728
Yeah, not time to hydroplane yet, eh.

826
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,167
- It's hibernate, you hoofer.
- That's what I said.

827
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,243
Hey, we saw smallish bear last night.

828
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,239
Yeah, we tried to stop him, eh,
but he wouldn't listen to us.

829
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,919
What? Where was he going?

830
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,279
Uh... Oh.

831
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,691
To get Nita, eh.

832
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,649
He said he was gonna bring her back for you.

833
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:45,644
Bring her back? No, no.

834
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,207
If he steps foot in the village,
the hunters will get him.

835
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,445
Oh, gee.

836
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,799
Almost there.

837
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,850
And now for the final touch,
a beautiful bead necklace.

838
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,321
Oh, no, you don't. Not this time.

839
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,279
This is much more appropriate.

840
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,521
Yeah, and that doesn't match
anything she's wearing.

841
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,602
And what makes you think those beads do?

842
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,287
Nita, what would make you happy?

843
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,650
Once again, we are ready.

844
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,645
Are you, my daughter?

845
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,321
Yes, Father.

846
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,080
I would expect a bride
to be smiling on her wedding day.

847
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,890
Is there something wrong?

848
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,003
Daddy, I'm so confused.

849
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,481
I thought that when I burned the amulet,
the bond would be broken,

850
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,208
but in my heart, I...

851
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,449
I'm sorry, Daddy.

852
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,049
I can't marry Atka.

853
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,567
Nita...

854
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,120
A bear! There's a bear in the village!

855
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,285
It's a bear.

856
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,211
Koda? Wait! Wait, don't hurt him.

857
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,286
No, our fish!

858
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,127
I got him!

859
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,011
We've got him now!

860
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,650
- Look, he's up in the tree!
- There he is. Get him!

861
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,239
Don't!

862
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,605
Don't! Please stop!

863
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,449
Look out, here he comes!

864
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,245
- Get your spears!
- Come on!

865
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,044
- Let's go after him.
- Atka, no!

866
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,767
- Leave him alone.
- Get him!

867
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,764
Oh, no. Run!

868
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,006
This way.

869
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,331
After them!

870
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,405
Nita, are you hurt?

871
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,891
I have to stop them.

872
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,007
There he is! Let's get him!

873
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,566
Follow me!

874
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,446
Rock! Look out! Get out of the way!

875
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,361
Stay low.

876
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,241
Kenai!

877
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,081
Hmm...

878
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,847
There you are. Got you!

879
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,121
Nice move, eh.

880
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,009
Gee, eh.

881
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,731
Oh! Our heroes.

882
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,806
Beauty, eh.

883
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,281
Come on! We have to find Kenai.

884
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,283
Aah!

885
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,720
Kenai!

886
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,325
No, don't!

887
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,161
Kenai!

888
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,526
How could you?

889
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,123
- What?
- He was my friend.

890
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,046
Kenai?

891
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:00,645
I can't... I don't understand. I'm sorry.

892
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,650
I love you, too.

893
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,321
The spirits?

894
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,243
Kenai, I can understand you.

895
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,130
I asked the spirits to turn you back into a man.

896
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,450
- What?
- So you could be with Nita.

897
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,641
No, Koda.

898
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,601
It's okay.
I just want you to be happy again.

899
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,124
Nita, I can't.

900
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,411
But I can.

901
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,562
Am I the only one that hears
these bears speaking?

902
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,325
- Yeah, that's beauty, eh.
- How's it going, eh?

903
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,006
Father.

904
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,010
Is this what you want?

905
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,644
Will this make you happy?

906
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,809
You are my daughter

907
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,724
and I will love you no matter what you choose.

908
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,959
Nita?

909
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,170
How do I look?

910
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,882
Like a bear, except they gave you antlers.

911
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,326
What?

912
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,125
Gotcha!

913
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,123
<i>Life is simple and clear</i>

914
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,728
<i>When you make the right choice</i>

915
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,689
<i>It's truth that you hear</i>

916
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,320
<i>When you find your own voice</i>

917
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,086
<i>Oh, my brothers and sisters, believe</i>

918
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,966
<i>You are just what you are meant to be</i>

919
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,408
<i>Oh, great spirits</i>

920
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:46,805
<i>Hear my voice today</i>

921
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,690
- I love happy endings, eh.
- I love happy endings, too.

922
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,564
And happy beginnings.

923
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,485
- Beauty, eh.
- Beauty.

924
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,330
Ow!

925
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,444
<i>Look all around you</i>

926
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,731
<i>Welcome, magic</i>

927
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,846
<i>Welcome, sweet sun ray</i>

928
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,048
<i>Welcome, my sweet sun ray</i>

929
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,565
<i>Love is no secret</i>

930
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,002
<i>Look all around you</i>

931
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,249
<i>Welcome to this day</i>

932
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,679
<i>Welcome, magic</i>

933
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,808
<i>Love is no secret</i>

934
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,999
<i>Look all around you</i>

935
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,641
<i>Welcome to this day</i>

936
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,519
<i>Learning how to smile again</i>

937
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,522
<i>Free to show my heart</i>

938
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,249
<i>Knowing I can face the things</i>
<i>that used to seem too hard</i>

939
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,881
<i>I look inside your eyes and see</i>

940
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,879
<i>A different part of me</i>

941
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,611
<i>What I didn't know I want in life</i>

942
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,921
<i>You're everything I need</i>

943
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:18,559
<i>So many things I've been missin'</i>
<i>and not watchin'</i>

944
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,962
<i>But that was all in the past</i>

945
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:26,802
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to learn</i>

946
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,119
<i>I'm ready for the world</i>

947
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,399
<i>Not scared of letting go</i>

948
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:36,008
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to feel</i>

949
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,680
<i>And my heart knows it's real</i>

950
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,003
<i>The part of me so long-forgotten</i>

951
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,607
<i>Is calling, and this feels like home</i>

952
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,079
<i>Home, home</i>

953
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:52,959
<i>Feels just like home</i>

954
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,089
<i>Right from the start,</i>
<i>been friends forever</i>

955
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,121
<i>Somehow we're meant to be together</i>

956
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:06,762
<i>I feel like you've shown me</i>
<i>how to find my way home</i>

957
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,279
<i>Find my way home</i>

958
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,567
<i>Now I realise</i>

959
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,480
<i>It feels just like home</i>

960
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,839
<i>Feels just like home</i>

961
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,286
<i>It feels just like home</i>

962
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,886
<i>Feels just like home</i>

963
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,803
<i>Yeah</i>

964
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:30,126
<i>Feels like home</i>

965
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:34,808
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to learn</i>

966
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,319
<i>I'm ready for the world</i>

967
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,639
<i>Not scared of letting go</i>

968
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:44,123
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to feel</i>

969
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,960
<i>And my heart knows it's real</i>

970
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:50,209
<i>The part of me so long-forgotten</i>

971
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,762
<i>Is calling, and this feels like home</i>

972
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,648
<i>This feels like home</i>

973
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,081
<i>Home, home</i>

974
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,323
<i>Feels just like home</i>

975
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,766
<i>Feels just like home</i>

976
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,047
<i>If you hear a voice</i>

977
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,525
<i>In the middle of the night</i>

978
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,727
<i>Sayin' it'll be all right</i>

979
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,529
<i>It will be me</i>

980
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,047
<i>If you feel a hand</i>

981
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,281
<i>Guiding you along</i>

982
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,045
<i>When the path seems wrong</i>

983
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,921
<i>It will be me</i>

984
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,850
<i>There is no mountain</i>

985
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,651
<i>That I can't climb</i>

986
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:07,929
<i>For you, I'd swim through</i>
<i>the rivers of time</i>

987
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:14,602
<i>As you go your way and I go mine</i>

988
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,931
<i>Our light will shine</i>

989
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,729
<i>And it will be me</i>

990
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,486
<i>If there is a key</i>

991
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,891
<i>That goes to your heart</i>

992
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,202
<i>A special part</i>

993
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,367
<i>It will be me</i>

994
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,407
<i>If you need a friend</i>

995
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,881
<i>Call out to the wind</i>

996
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,931
<i>To hold you again</i>

997
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,361
<i>It will be me</i>

998
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,561
<i>Oh, how the world</i>

999
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,760
<i>Seems so unfair</i>

1000
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:06,127
<i>Creating a love</i>
<i>that cannot be shared</i>

1001
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:13,242
<i>As you go your way and I go mine</i>

1002
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,331
<i>Our light will shine</i>

1003
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,522
<i>And it will be me</i>

1004
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,762
<i>Past the ever after</i>

1005
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,331
<i>There's a place for two</i>

1006
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,170
<i>In your tears and laughter</i>

1007
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:49,008
<i>I'll be there for you</i>

1008
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,971
<i>In the sun and the moon</i>

1009
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,284
<i>In the land and the sea</i>

1010
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,611
<i>Look all around you</i>

1011
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,840
<i>It will be me</i>

1012
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,331
<i>There is no mountain</i>

1013
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,967
<i>That I can't climb</i>

1014
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:17,563
<i>For you, I'd swim through</i>
<i>the rivers of time</i>

1015
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:24,283
<i>As you go your way and I go mine</i>

1016
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,401
<i>Our light will shine</i>

1017
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:32,045
<i>And it will be me</i>

1018
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,521
<i>It will be me</i>

1019
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:46,406
<i>It will be me</i>
