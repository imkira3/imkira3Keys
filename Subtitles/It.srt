00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,368
Sure I won't get in trouble, Bill?

3
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,567
Don't be a wuss.

4
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,286
I'd come with you if I weren't dying.

5
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,895
You're not dying!

6
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,724
You didn't see the vomit
coming out of my nose this morning?

7
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,403
That's disgusting.

8
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,644
Okay. Go get the wax.

9
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,931
In the cellar?

10
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,965
You want it to float, don't you?

11
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,930
Fine.

12
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,646
<i>Georgie.</i>

13
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,286
Hurry up.

14
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,446
Okay. I'm brave.

15
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,490
Where's the wax?

16
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,121
There's the wax.

17
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,281
Yes.

18
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,761
What was that? What's that?

19
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,441
Oh, jeez.

20
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,811
All right.

21
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,010
There you go.

22
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,163
She's all ready, Captain.

23
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,401
She?

24
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,171
You always call boats "she."

25
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,561
"She."

26
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,081
Thanks, Billy.

27
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,801
See you later. Bye.

28
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,810
Be careful.

29
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,881
No!

30
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,121
No!

31
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,485
Oh, Bill's gonna kill me.

32
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,722
Hiya, Georgie.

33
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,451
What a nice boat.

34
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,561
Do you want it back?

35
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,050
Um, yes, please.

36
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,529
You look like a nice boy.
I bet you have a lot of friends.

37
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,685
Three, but my brother's my best best.

38
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,126
Where is he?

39
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,488
In bed. Sick.

40
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,162
I bet I can cheer him up.
I'll give him a balloon.

41
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,405
Do you want a balloon too, Georgie?

42
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,843
I'm not supposed to take stuff
from strangers.

43
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,563
Oh... Well, I'm Pennywise the Dancing Clown.

44
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,920
"Pennywise?" "Yes." "Meet Georgie.

45
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,362
"Georgie, meet Pennywise."

46
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,131
Now we aren't strangers, are we?

47
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,129
What are you doing in the sewer?

48
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,846
A storm blew me away.

49
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,330
Blew the whole circus away.

50
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,531
Can you smell the circus, Georgie?

51
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,766
There's peanuts, cotton candy,

52
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,930
<i>hot dogs,</i>

53
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,804
and...

54
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,761
Popcorn?

55
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,122
Popcorn! Is that your favorite?

56
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,085
- Uh-huh.
- Mine, too.

57
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,045
Because they pop. Pop, pop, pop.

58
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,601
Pop, pop, pop.

59
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,723
Pop.

60
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,130
I should get going now.

61
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,361
Oh.

62
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,530
Without your boat?

63
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,486
<i>You don't wanna lose it, Georgie.</i>

64
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,849
Bill's gonna kill you.

65
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,885
Here.

66
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,211
Take it.

67
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,963
Take it, Georgie.

68
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,726
Help!

69
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,961
Billy!

70
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,685
<i>Pull it, Mike.</i>

71
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,524
<i>Go on now, pull it.</i>

72
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,647
Here, reload it.

73
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,764
You need to start taking
more responsibility around here, Mike.

74
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,451
Your dad was younger than you when he took...

75
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,847
I'm not my dad, okay?

76
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,607
Yeah.

77
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,170
Look at me, son.

78
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,041
Look at me!

79
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,246
There are two places you
can be in this world.

80
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,364
You can be out here like us
or you can be in there,

81
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,325
like them.

82
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,284
You waste time hemming and hawing,

83
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,882
and someone else
is gonna make that choice for you.

84
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,765
Except you won't know it until
you feel that bolt between your eyes.

85
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,161
So, there's this church full of Jews, right?

86
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,323
And Stan has to take this super Jewy test.

87
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,965
But how's it work?

88
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,931
They slice the tip of his dick off.

89
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,451
But then Stan will have nothing left!

90
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,324
- That's true.
- Wait up, you guys!

91
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,000
Hey, Stan, what happens
at the Bar Mitzvah, anyways?

92
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,562
Ed says they slice the tip of your dick off.

93
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,002
Yeah, and I think the rabbi's
gonna pull down your pants,

94
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,565
turn to the crowd and say,
"Where's the beef?"

95
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,441
At the Bar Mitzvah, I read from the Torah,

96
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,007
and then I make a speech
and suddenly, I become a man.

97
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,770
I could think of funner ways to become a man.

98
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,281
- <i>"More fun" you mean.</i>
- Oh, shit.

99
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,562
Think they'll sign my yearbook?

100
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,491
"Dear Richie, sorry for taking a hot,
steaming dump in your backpack last March.

101
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,485
<i>"Have a good summer."</i>

102
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,524
<i>Are you in there by yourself, Beaver-ly?</i>

103
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,246
Or do you have half the guys in the school
with you, huh, slut?

104
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,766
I know you're in there, little shit.
I can smell you.

105
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,809
<i>No wonder you don't have any friends.</i>

106
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,925
Which is it, Gretta?
Am I a slut or a little shit?

107
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,481
Make up your mind.

108
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,847
You're trash.

109
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,561
We just wanted to remind you.

110
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,721
<i>Such a loser.</i>

111
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,563
<i>Well, at least now you'll smell better.</i>

112
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,761
<i>Gross.</i>

113
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,930
Let's go, girls.

114
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,770
<i>Have a nice summer, Beaver-ly.</i>

115
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,849
<i>Pathetic.</i>

116
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,281
Best feeling ever.

117
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,441
Yeah?

118
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,204
Try tickling your pickle for the first time.

119
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,681
Hey, what do you guys wanna do tomorrow?

120
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,041
I start my training.

121
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,884
- Wait, what training?
- <i>Street Fighter.</i>

122
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,520
Is that how you wanna spend your summer?
Inside of an arcade?

123
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,451
Beats spending it inside of your mother.

124
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,365
- Oh!
- What if we go to the quarry?

125
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,051
Guys, we have the Barrens.

126
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,287
Right.

127
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,721
Betty Ripsom's mom.

128
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,846
<i>Is she really expecting to
see her come out of that school?</i>

129
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,727
I don't know.

130
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,042
As if Betty Ripsom's been hiding
in Home Ec. for the last few weeks.

131
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,526
You think they'll actually find her?

132
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,681
Sure.

133
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,326
In a ditch. All decomposed,
covered in worms and maggots.

134
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,567
Smelling like Eddie's mom's underwear.

135
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,085
Shut up! That's freaking disgusting.

136
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,324
She's not dead. She's missing.

137
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,764
Sorry, Bill. She's missing.

138
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,930
You know the Barrens aren't that bad.

139
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,686
Who doesn't love splashing around
in shitty water?

140
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,045
Nice Frisbee, flamer.

141
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,924
Give it back!

142
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,161
Fucking losers!

143
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,441
Loser.

144
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,446
You suck, Bowers.

145
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,921
Shut up, Bill.

146
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,085
You say something, Billy?

147
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,605
You got a free ride this year
'cause of your little brother.

148
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,290
Ride's over, Denbrough.

149
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,571
This summer's gonna be a hurt train
for you and your faggot friends.

150
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,450
I wish he'd go missing.

151
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,165
He's probably the one doing it.

152
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,801
You gonna let me go by?

153
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,809
Or is there a secret password or something?

154
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,081
Oh.

155
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,370
- Um, sorry.
- Sorry isn't...

156
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,521
A password.

157
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,370
Henry and his goons are over
by the west entrance.

158
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,721
So you should be fine.

159
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,961
Oh, I wasn't...

160
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,003
Everyone knows he's looking for you.

161
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,730
What you listening to?

162
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,166
New Kids on the Block.

163
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,691
I don't even like them. I was just...

164
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,162
Wait. You're the new kid, right?
Now I get it.

165
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,851
There's nothing to get.

166
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,083
I'm just messing with you.

167
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,687
I'm Beverly Marsh.

168
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,248
Yeah. I know that
'cause we're in the same class.

169
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,528
Social Studies. And you were...

170
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,167
I'm Ben. But pretty much
everybody just calls me...

171
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,725
The new kid.

172
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,089
Well, Ben, there are worse things
to be called.

173
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,925
Let me sign this.

174
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,248
Stay cool, Ben from sosh class.

175
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,771
Uh, yeah.

176
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,726
You too, Beverly.

177
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,008
Hang tough, new kid on the block.

178
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,765
"Please Don't Go, Girl."

179
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,005
That's the name of another
New Kids on the Block song.

180
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,763
"He thrusts his fists against the posts...

181
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,491
"He thrusts his fists against...

182
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,121
Shit!

183
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,121
"Post."

184
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,883
Need some help? I...

185
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,004
I thought we agreed.

186
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,051
- Before you say anything...
- Bill.

187
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,681
Just let me show you something first.

188
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,525
The Barrens.

189
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,043
It's the only place that
Georgie could have ended up.

190
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,685
He's gone, Bill.

191
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,650
But if the storm swept Georgie in,
we should have gone...

192
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,884
He's gone! He's dead!

193
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,686
<i>He's dead! There is nothing we can do!
Nothing!</i>

194
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,449
Now take this down
before your mother sees it.

195
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,001
Next time you wanna take something
from my office...

196
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,207
Ask.

197
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,523
I guess you get your tunnels back.

198
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,681
Get in!

199
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,881
<i>Creep!</i>

200
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,201
Oh, Jesus.

201
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,241
<i>Mike!</i>

202
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,161
<i>Hurry, son!</i>

203
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,004
<i>Help! It burns!</i>

204
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,761
<i>Mike!</i>

205
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,489
Stay the fuck outta my town!

206
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,801
Mike?

207
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,481
<i>Are you okay?</i>

208
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,523
You're not studying, Stanley.

209
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,325
How's it going to look?

210
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,683
The rabbi's son
can't finish his own Torah reading.

211
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,165
Take the book to my office.

212
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,283
<i>Obviously you're not using it.</i>

213
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,769
<i>Take everything
but the Delicious Deals, guys.</i>

214
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,041
<i>My mom loves them.</i>

215
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,967
Hey! First you said the Barrens,
and now you're saying the sewer.

216
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,640
I mean, what if we get caught?

217
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,451
We won't, Eds. The sewers are public works.

218
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,926
We're the public, aren't we?

219
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,807
Hey, Eddie, these your birth control pills?

220
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,563
Yeah, and I'm saving it for your sister.
This is private stuff.

221
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,441
<i>Hello, and welcome to</i>
<i>the</i> Derry Children's Hour.

222
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,761
Eddie Bear, where you boys off to
in such a rush?

223
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,448
Um...

224
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,969
Just my backyard, Mrs. K.

225
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,090
I got a new...

226
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,362
- A new croquet set.
- Jeez, spit it out, Bill!

227
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,607
Okay.

228
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,681
Oh, and sweetie, don't go
rolling around on the grass.

229
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,610
Especially if it's just been cut.

230
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,243
You know how bad your allergies can get.

231
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,805
Yes, Mom. Let's go.

232
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,167
<i>Aren't you forgetting something?</i>

233
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,409
<i>Water is all around us. It's even above us.</i>

234
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,240
<i>Don't believe me?</i>

235
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,885
<i>Then try it yourself at home.</i>

236
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,004
<i>Whenever you're outside...</i>

237
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,326
Do you want one from me too, Mrs. K?

238
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,931
- I was kidding.
- No, no, no.

239
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,761
Sorry, Mommy.

240
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,490
"Your hair is winter fire, January embers...

241
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,447
"My heart burns there too."

242
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,641
<i>Slow down!</i>

243
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,610
<i>Hi-ho, Silver!</i>

244
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,841
Away!

245
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,247
Your old lady bike's too fast for us!

246
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,207
Found it.

247
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,084
Isn't it summer vacation?

248
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,125
I would think you'd be ready
to take a break from the books.

249
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,401
I like it in here.

250
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,325
A boy should be spending his summer
outside with friends.

251
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,886
Don't you have any friends?

252
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,484
Can I have the book now?

253
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,201
<i>Egg boy.</i>

254
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,081
<i>What on earth are you doing?</i>

255
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,450
Where are you off to, tits?

256
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,361
Gotcha.

257
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,611
<i>Wait.</i>

258
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,966
- Fucking hold him.
- Leave me alone!

259
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,161
- Smack him.
- Don't let tubby get away.

260
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,321
Help!

261
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,004
Get him!

262
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,166
- Hold him, Hockstetter.
- Get him, Belch.

263
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,281
Stop!

264
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,131
- Just leave me alone.
- Look at all this blubber!

265
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,285
Let me light his hair, like Michael Jackson.

266
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,921
Just hold him.

267
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,208
Get off me! Get off me!

268
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,681
Help!

269
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,961
Help!

270
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,841
Okay, new kid.

271
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,891
This is what us locals
call the Kissing Bridge.

272
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,211
It's famous for two things. Sucking face,

273
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,087
and carving names.

274
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,611
Henry, please.

275
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,281
Whoa, whoa! Henry!

276
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,521
Shut up!

277
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,851
I'm gonna carve my whole name
onto this cottage cheese!

278
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,688
I'm gonna cut your fucking tits off.
I swear to God!

279
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,201
Get him!

280
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,401
<i>Come on!</i>

281
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,241
<i>Get him!</i>

282
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,681
You can't run!

283
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,843
- Oh, no!
- <i>We need to find Fatty!</i>

284
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,571
My knife. My old man will kill me!

285
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,843
- You two, get him!
- Come on!

286
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,691
Move your fucking ass!

287
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,560
<i>He's going that way! Come on!</i>

288
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,246
<i>He's down there.</i>

289
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,410
I don't know. I guess.

290
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,371
That's poison ivy. And that's poison ivy.

291
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,806
And that's poison ivy.

292
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,684
Where? Where's the poison ivy?

293
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,771
Nowhere. Not every fucking plant
is poison ivy, Stanley.

294
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,049
Okay, I'm starting to get itchy now

295
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,441
and I'm pretty sure
this is not good for my...

296
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,206
Do you use the same bathroom as your mother?

297
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,131
- Sometimes, yeah.
- Then you probably have crabs.

298
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,321
<i>That's so not funny.</i>

299
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,687
Aren't you guys coming in?

300
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,250
Uh-uh. It's greywater.

301
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,601
What the hell's greywater?

302
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,605
It's basically piss and shit.
So I'm just telling you,

303
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,289
<i>you guys are splashing around
in millions of gallons of Derry pee. So...</i>

304
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,527
Are you serious? What are you...

305
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,728
Doesn't smell like caca to me, <i>señor.</i>

306
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,729
Okay, I can smell that from here.

307
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,162
It's probably just your breath
wafting back into your face.

308
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,682
Have you ever heard of a staph infection?

309
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,041
Oh, I'll show you a staff infection.

310
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,765
<i>This is so unsanitary. You're literally...</i>

311
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,042
<i>This is literally like swimming
inside of a toilet bowl right now.</i>

312
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,691
<i>Have you ever heard of Listeria?</i>

313
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,527
<i>Are you retarded?</i>

314
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,484
You're the reason why
we're in this position right now.

315
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,920
Guys!

316
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,248
Shit. Don't tell me that's...

317
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,841
<i>No.</i>

318
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,443
Georgie wore galoshes.

319
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,360
Whose sneaker is it?

320
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,441
It's Betty Ripsom's.

321
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,080
Oh, shit.

322
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,566
<i>Oh, God. Oh, fuck!</i>

323
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,847
I don't like this.

324
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,849
How do you think Betty feels?

325
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,205
Running around these tunnels
with only one frickin' shoe?

326
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,851
What if she's still here?

327
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,360
Eddie, come on!

328
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,245
My mom will have an aneurysm, if she
finds out that we're playing down here.

329
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,401
I'm serious.

330
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,127
Bill?

331
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,325
If... If I was Betty Ripsom,
I would want us to find me.

332
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,405
Georgie too.

333
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,366
What if I don't want to find them?

334
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,046
I mean, no offense, Bill,
but I don't want to end up like...

335
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,605
I don't want to go missing either.

336
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,527
- He has a point.
- You too?

337
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,085
It's summer.

338
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,725
We're supposed to be having fun.

339
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,325
<i>This isn't fun.</i>

340
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,320
This is scary and disgusting.

341
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,083
Holy shit! What happened to you?

342
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,042
I hear ya, tits.

343
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,882
Don't think you can stay down here
all damn day now.

344
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,641
You found us, Patrick.

345
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,764
<i>You found us, Patrick.</i>

346
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,291
<i>Patrick.</i>

347
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,681
Fuck!

348
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,804
I think it's great that
we're helping the new kid,

349
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,365
but also we need to think of our own safety.

350
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,130
I mean, he's bleeding all over
and you guys know

351
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,402
that there's an AIDS epidemic happening
right now as we speak, right?

352
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,122
My mom's friend in New York City got it
by touching a dirty pole on the subway.

353
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,324
And a drop of AIDS blood got into
his system through a hangnail. A hangnail!

354
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,370
And you can amputate legs and arms.

355
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,086
But how do you amputate a waist?

356
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,647
You guys do know that alleys are known
for dirty needles that have AIDS, right?

357
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,801
You guys do know that?

358
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,646
- Hey...
- Ah, we're screwed.

359
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,570
Richie, wait here. Come on.

360
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,089
Glad I got to meet you before you died.

361
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,441
Okay.

362
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,520
<i>Can we afford all that?</i>

363
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,801
It's all we got.

364
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,127
You kidding me?

365
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,802
Wait, you have an account here, don't you?

366
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,965
If my mom finds out
I bought all this stuff for myself...

367
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,044
I'm spending the whole rest of the weekend
in the emergency room getting X-rayed.

368
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,163
- <i>See you later, Dad.</i>
- <i>See you, Gretta.</i>

369
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,086
You okay?

370
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,843
I'm fine. What's wrong with you?

371
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,327
None of your business.

372
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,722
There's a kid outside.
Looked like someone killed him.

373
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,969
We need some supplies,

374
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,845
but we don't have enough money.

375
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,890
I like your glasses, Mr. Keene.

376
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,807
You look just like Clark Kent.

377
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,331
Oh.

378
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,011
I don't know about that.

379
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,480
Can I try them?

380
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,328
Mmm. Sure.

381
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,050
What do you think?

382
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,242
Well, how about that?

383
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,922
You look just like Lois Lane.

384
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,045
Really?

385
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,646
Mmm.

386
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,331
Well, here you go.

387
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,166
Shoot, I'm so sorry.

388
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,921
It's okay.

389
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,207
<i>Just suck the wound.</i>

390
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,289
- <i>I need to focus right now.</i>
- <i>You need to focus?</i>

391
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,601
Yeah, can you go get me something?

392
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,883
- Jesus! What do you need?
- Go get my bifocals.

393
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,207
I hid 'em in my second fanny pack.

394
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,811
<i>Why do you have two fanny packs?</i>

395
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,491
<i>I need to focus right now
and it's a long story.</i>

396
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,721
<i>I don't want to get into it.</i>

397
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,208
Um, thanks.

398
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,447
Even-steven.

399
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,961
<i>Oh, God, he's bleeding. Oh, my God!</i>

400
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,241
Ben from sosh?

401
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,767
You have to suck the wound
before you apply the Band-Aids.

402
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,769
- This is 101.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

403
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,928
Are you okay? That looks like it hurts.

404
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,128
Oh. No, I'm good. I just fell.

405
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,651
Yeah, right into Henry Bowers.

406
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,325
Shut it, Richie.

407
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,721
Why? It's the truth.

408
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,802
You sure they got the right stuff
to fix you up?

409
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,811
You know, we'll take care of him.

410
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,286
Uh, thanks again, Beverly.

411
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,484
Sure. Maybe I'll see you around.

412
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,444
Yeah, we were thinking about
going to the quarry tomorrow,

413
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,370
if you wanna

414
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,761
<i>come.</i>

415
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,687
Good to know. Thanks.

416
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,409
Nice going bringing up Bowers
in front of her.

417
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,601
Yeah, dude, you heard what she did.

418
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,887
What'd she do?

419
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,167
More like "Who'd she do?"

420
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,482
From what I hear,
the list is longer than my wang.

421
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,325
That's not saying much.

422
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,006
They're just rumors.

423
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,403
Anyway, Bill had her back in third grade.

424
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,801
<i>They kissed in the school play.</i>

425
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,401
<i>The reviews said you can't fake
that sort of passion.</i>

426
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,007
Now, pip-pip and tally-ho, my good fellows,

427
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,523
I do believe this chap requires
our utmost attention.

428
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,250
Get in there, Dr. K. Come on, fix him up.

429
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,323
Why don't you shut the fuck up,
Einstein, because I know what I'm doing

430
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,011
and I don't want you doing
the British guy with me right now.

431
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,764
Suck the wound. Get in there.

432
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,849
<i>Toilet and bath water travel down</i>

433
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,162
<i>the drains and into the sewer.</i>

434
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,922
<i>The sewer is a fun place to play
with all of your friends.</i>

435
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,609
<i>Just follow the water into the drains
and down into the sewers you go.</i>

436
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,363
<i>When you're with your friends in the
sewers, you can be as silly as a clown!</i>

437
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,762
<i>That's right, it's the word of the day.</i>

438
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,121
Hi, Daddy.

439
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,687
Hey, Bevvie.

440
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,487
Whatcha got there?

441
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,206
Just some things.

442
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,960
Like what?

443
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,007
Tell me you're still my little girl.

444
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,886
Yes, Daddy.

445
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,927
Good.

446
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,720
<i>A deep fly ball to the left. His last at bat.</i>

447
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,570
<i>He scratched the foul pole.</i>

448
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,403
<i>Wade Boggs, of course,
leads the league in hitting so far.</i>

449
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,686
This is what you did. This is what you...

450
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,166
This is...

451
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,641
<i>Lay it out.</i>

452
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,761
Oh, my God.

453
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,971
- So easy.
- Poor tree.

454
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,531
So easy!

455
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,970
Oh, my God, that was terrible. I win.

456
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,281
- You won?
- Yeah.

457
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,483
- Did you see my loogie?
- That went the farthest!

458
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,205
- It's by distance.
- Mass. It's always been mass.

459
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,686
What is mass?

460
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,160
Who cares how far it goes?

461
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,284
It matters how cool it looks, like it's
green or it's white or juicy and fat.

462
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,481
- All right.
- Thanks for that.

463
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,846
- Who's first?
- That was terrible.

464
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,407
<i>I'll go!</i>

465
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,801
<i>Sissies.</i>

466
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,084
What the fuck!

467
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,847
Oh, holy shit! We just got showed up
by a girl.

468
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,201
Do we have to do that now?

469
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,401
Yes.

470
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,721
<i>Come on!</i>

471
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,090
Oh, shit.

472
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,963
I already won! We already won!

473
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,850
They're down! Yes!

474
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,851
<i>Ah, fuck! What was that?</i>

475
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,565
Something just touched my foot right here.

476
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,207
That work?

477
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,964
- Where are we looking?
- Right here, right here!

478
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,161
It's a turtle.

479
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,568
News flash, Ben. School's out for summa!

480
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,285
Oh, that? That's not school stuff.

481
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,289
- Who sent you this?
- No one. Give it...

482
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,521
No one.

483
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,121
- What's with the history project?
- Oh...

484
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,088
When I first moved here,
I didn't have anyone to hang out with,

485
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,882
so I just started spending time
in the library.

486
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,090
<i>You went to the library?</i>

487
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,320
On purpose?

488
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,925
Oh, I wanna see.

489
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,325
<i>What's The Black Spot?</i>

490
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,721
<i>The Black Spot was a nightclub</i>

491
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,291
<i>that was burned down years ago
by that racist cult.</i>

492
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,086
<i>The what?</i>

493
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,241
<i>Don't you watch</i> Geraldo?

494
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,443
Your hair...

495
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,643
Your... Your hair is beautiful, Beverly.

496
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,887
Oh.

497
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,650
Right. Thanks.

498
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,003
<i>Here, pass it.</i>

499
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,091
Why is it all murders and missing kids?

500
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,127
Derry's not like any town
I've ever been in before.

501
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,970
They did a study once, and it turns out

502
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,168
people die or disappear
six times the national average.

503
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,611
You read that?

504
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,009
<i>And that's just grown-ups.</i>

505
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,850
Kids are worse.

506
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,520
Way, way worse.

507
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,084
I've got more stuff if you wanna see it.

508
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,407
No, no.

509
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,244
<i>Don't freak out, just tell us.</i>

510
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,721
<i>Yeah. I heard he has
a rollercoaster and a pet chimp</i>

511
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,685
and an old guy's fucking bones. Yeah.

512
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

513
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,801
Wow.

514
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,081
Cool, huh?

515
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,922
No. No, nothing cool.

516
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,043
<i>There's nothing cool.</i>

517
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,526
This is cool, right here.
Wait, no. No, it's not cool.

518
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,046
What's that?

519
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,050
Oh, that? That's the charter
for Derry Township.

520
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,765
Nerd alert.

521
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,281
No, actually, it's really interesting.

522
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,244
Derry started as a beaver trapping camp.

523
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,602
Still is, am I right, boys?

524
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,445
Ninety-one people signed the charter
that made Derry.

525
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,446
<i>But later that winter,
they all disappeared without a trace.</i>

526
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,965
The entire camp?

527
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,287
<i>There were rumors of Indians,</i>
but no sign of an attack.

528
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,125
<i>Everybody just thought
it was a plague or something.</i>

529
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,606
<i>But it's like</i>

530
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,285
<i>one day everybody just woke up and left.</i>

531
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,570
The only clue was a trail of
bloody clothes leading to the well house.

532
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,565
<i>Jesus. We can get Derry</i>
<i>on</i> Unsolved Mysteries.

533
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,883
- Let's do that. You're brilliant.
- I might be.

534
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,961
I don't know.

535
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,561
Maybe he's just trying to
make some friends, Stanley.

536
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,731
Where was the well house?

537
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,962
I don't know. Somewhere in town, I guess.

538
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,407
<i>Why?</i>

539
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,801
Nothing.

540
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,161
<i>Nobody knows the trouble I've seen</i>

541
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,004
<i>Nobody knows my sorrow</i>

542
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,643
<i>Eddie...</i>

543
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,491
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

544
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,849
Oh!

545
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,607
Fuck. My mom's gonna fucking flip.

546
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,200
Do you think this will help me, Eddie?

547
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,771
Help! Help!

548
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,883
Where you going, Eds?

549
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,246
If you lived here, you'd be home by now.

550
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,727
Come join the clown, Eds.

551
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,811
<i>You'll float down here.</i>

552
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,129
We all float down here.

553
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,606
Yes, we do.

554
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,606
"Your hair is winter fire...

555
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,721
"January embers...

556
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,960
"My heart burns there, too."

557
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,000
<i>Beverly...</i>

558
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,083
<i>Beverly.</i>

559
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,965
<i>Help me.</i>

560
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,485
<i>Help me, please.</i>

561
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,764
<i>We all want to meet you, Beverly.</i>

562
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,326
<i>We all float down here.</i>

563
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,243
Hello? Who are you?

564
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,488
- <i>I'm Veronica.</i>
- <i>Betty Ripsom.</i>

565
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,330
<i>Patrick Hockstetter.</i>

566
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,967
<i>Come closer.</i>

567
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,282
- <i>Wanna see?</i>
- <i>We float.</i>

568
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,403
<i>We change.</i>

569
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,761
<i>Daddy!</i>

570
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,047
Help!

571
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,651
Help!

572
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,841
The hell's going on?

573
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,570
The sink...

574
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,690
And the blood... It's...

575
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,724
What blood?

576
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,524
The sink. You don't see it?

577
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,087
<i>There was blood.</i>

578
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,570
You worry me, Bevvie.

579
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,888
<i>You worry me a lot.</i>

580
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,885
But don't you see?

581
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,322
Why'd you do this to your hair?

582
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,728
Makes you look like a boy.

583
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,284
Georgie.

584
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,090
<i>I lost it, Billy. Don't be mad.</i>

585
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,281
I'm not mad at you.

586
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,048
It just floated off.

587
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,440
But, Bill, if you'll come with me,

588
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,762
you'll float, too.

589
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,121
Georgie.

590
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,089
You'll float, too. You'll float, too.

591
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,248
<i>You'll float, too.</i>

592
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,204
- You'll float, too.
- You'll float, too.

593
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,404
<i>You'll float, too. You'll float, too.</i>

594
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,926
<i>You'll float, too.</i>

595
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,727
You'll float, too! You'll float, too!

596
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,890
You'll float, too!

597
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,410
You'll float, too!

598
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,321
<i>No, we gotta go through the alleyway.</i>

599
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,125
- <i>The alley takes way too long.</i>
- <i>No, the alley is so much faster.</i>

600
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,685
<i>The alley is more dangerous
and it's disgusting.</i>

601
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,485
- <i>How is it more dangerous?</i>
- <i>It smells like piss and it's gross.</i>

602
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,330
- <i>Just take the side streets for once.</i>
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

603
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,171
<i>The side streets are the same.
They smell like piss and shit.</i>

604
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,402
<i>Okay, okay. Can you just tell me
what she said exactly?</i>

605
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,641
<i>She didn't say anything.</i>

606
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,847
<i>She just said that
you guys need to hurry over.</i>

607
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,365
She didn't say anything. Okay. Okay.

608
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,089
You made it. I...

609
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,845
I need to show you something.

610
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,161
What is it?

611
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,487
More than we saw at the quarry?

612
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,011
Shut up! Just shut up, Richie.

613
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,207
My dad will kill me if he finds out
I had boys in the apartment.

614
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,849
Then we'll leave a lookout.

615
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,202
Richie, stay here.

616
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,647
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What if her dad comes back?

617
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,841
Do what you always do. Start talking.

618
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,120
It is a gift.

619
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,281
In there.

620
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,205
<i>What is it?</i>

621
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,686
<i>You'll see.</i>

622
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,564
Are you taking us to your bathroom?

623
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,007
I just want you to know that 89%
of the worst accidents in homes

624
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,043
are caused in bathrooms.

625
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,005
And, I mean, that's where
all the bacteria and fungi are

626
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,402
and it's not a really sanitary place...

627
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,245
<i>I knew it!</i>

628
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,401
<i>You see it?</i>

629
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,165
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>What...</i>

630
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,721
<i>What happened in here?</i>

631
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,561
My dad couldn't see it.
I thought I might be crazy.

632
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,928
<i>Well, if you're crazy, then we're all crazy.</i>

633
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,243
We can't leave it like this.

634
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,166
<i>All right, so you've</i>

635
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,481
<i>never been to the Derry Summer Fair?</i>

636
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,847
No, I don't think so.

637
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,251
<i>Not that I know of.</i>

638
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,162
<i>Well, I go there every year,</i>

639
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,529
<i>but I was there one time with Richie and
technically won 'cause I hit the target.</i>

640
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,321
<i>But there were so many prizes,
I didn't know which to pick.</i>

641
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,002
It's not true, you know.

642
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,611
What they say about me.

643
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,522
I was only ever kissed by one guy.

644
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,323
It was a long time ago.

645
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,328
It was a nice kiss though.

646
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,890
"January embers."

647
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,529
Was that in the play?

648
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,290
No, the poem.

649
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,851
Oh...

650
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,203
Oh, I don't really know much poetry.

651
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,483
Oh. I was just...

652
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,647
Never mind then.

653
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,881
Um...

654
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,570
Just so you know, I...

655
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,802
I never believed any of the rumors.

656
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,083
And none of us Losers do.

657
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,891
We like hanging with you.

658
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,766
Thanks.

659
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,923
You shouldn't thank us too much.

660
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,163
Hanging out with us makes you a Loser, too.

661
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,251
I can take that.

662
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,923
No, I love being
your personal doorman, really.

663
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,730
Could you idiots have taken any longer?

664
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,769
- All right, shut up, Richie.
- Yeah, shut up, Richie.

665
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,366
Oh, okay, trash the trashmouth, I get it.

666
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,449
Hey, I wasn't the one
scrubbing the bathroom floor

667
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,923
and imagining that her sink went all
Eddie's mom's vagina on Halloween.

668
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,123
She didn't imagine it.

669
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,601
I...

670
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,202
I saw something, too.

671
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,407
You saw blood, too?

672
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,441
Not blood.

673
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,291
I saw Georgie.

674
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,803
It seemed so real.

675
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,043
I mean, it seemed like him,
but there was this...

676
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:46,961
The clown.

677
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,411
Yeah, I saw him, too.

678
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,006
Wait, can only virgins see this stuff?

679
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,730
Is that why I'm not seeing this shit?

680
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,291
<i>Oh, shit, that's Belch Huggins' car.</i>

681
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,930
- We should probably get outta here.
- Yeah.

682
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,487
Wait, isn't that the homeschooled kid's bike?

683
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,761
<i>Yeah, that's Mike's.</i>

684
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,331
We have to help him.

685
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,766
We should?

686
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:21,961
Yes.

687
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,684
<i>Come on.</i>

688
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,161
<i>Eat that meat!</i>

689
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,851
- Eat it, bitch!
- You little fucker!

690
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,650
- Bitch!
- Motherfucker!

691
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,126
- <i>Eat it, you little bitch!</i>
- <i>Pussy!</i>

692
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,361
<i>Fucking...</i>

693
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,687
<i>Whatcha gonna do, huh?</i>

694
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,841
Get up!

695
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,281
Get the fuck up!

696
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,681
You little fucker!

697
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,801
Come on, Henry, smack him!

698
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,047
You little bitch.

699
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,367
- Nice throw.
- Thanks.

700
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,965
<i>You losers are trying too hard.</i>

701
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,847
She'll do you.

702
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,849
<i>You just gotta ask nicely,</i>

703
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,563
like I did.

704
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,011
What the fuck?

705
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,921
<i>Come on, get 'em! Fuck!</i>

706
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,491
Rock war!

707
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,363
- Get 'em!
- Watch out!

708
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,684
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

709
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,361
Eddie!

710
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,601
- <i>Fuck outta here!</i>
- Ow!

711
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,401
Ah, shit!

712
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,162
Fuck you, bitch!

713
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,281
Come on, guys! Let's get 'em!

714
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,851
- Fuck this.
- <i>Fuck out of here.</i>

715
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,604
<i>Fuck you, losers!</i>

716
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,246
Go blow your dad, you mullet-wearing asshole!

717
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,124
Thanks, guys,
but you shouldn't have done that.

718
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,925
They'll be after you guys, too, now.

719
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,647
Oh, no, no, no. Bowers? He's always after us.

720
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:47,171
I guess that's one thing
we all have in common.

721
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,768
Yeah, Homeschool.
Welcome to the Losers' Club.

722
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,881
<i>Right there.</i>

723
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,047
<i>They say they found part of his hand
all chewed up near the Standpipe.</i>

724
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,564
He asked to borrow a pencil once.

725
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:15,562
It's like she's been forgotten
because Corcoran's missing.

726
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,361
Is it ever gonna end?

727
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,766
What the fuck, dude?

728
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,565
What are you guys talking about?

729
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,804
What they always talk about.

730
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,445
I actually think it will end.

731
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,165
For a little while, at least.

732
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,361
What do you mean?

733
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,164
So I was going over all my Derry research
and I charted out all the big events.

734
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,408
The Ironworks explosion in 1908,

735
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,330
the Bradley Gang in '35,

736
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,568
and The Black Spot in '62.

737
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,723
And now kids being...

738
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,320
I realized this stuff seems to happen...

739
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,130
Every 27 years.

740
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,651
<i>Okay, so, let me get this straight.</i>

741
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,082
<i>It comes out from wherever
to eat kids for, like, a year?</i>

742
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,163
<i>And then what? It just goes into hibernation?</i>

743
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,846
Maybe it's like... What do you call it?

744
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,247
Cicadas.

745
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,522
You know, the bugs that come out
once every 17 years.

746
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,443
My grandfather thinks this town is cursed.

747
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:14,404
He says that all the bad things that happen
in this town are because of one thing.

748
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,325
An evil thing that feeds off
the people of Derry.

749
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,724
But it can't be one thing.

750
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,410
We all saw something different.

751
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,081
<i>Maybe.</i>

752
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,681
Or maybe It knows what scares us most
and that's what we see.

753
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,923
I saw a leper.

754
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,162
He was like a walking infection.

755
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,001
But you didn't.

756
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,364
Because it isn't real.

757
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,086
<i>None of this is.</i>

758
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,080
Not Eddie's leper

759
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,442
or Bill seeing Georgie

760
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,207
or the woman I keep seeing.

761
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,361
She hot?

762
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,201
No, Richie.

763
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,921
She's not hot.

764
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,126
Her face is all messed up.

765
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,046
<i>None of this makes any sense.</i>

766
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,284
They're all like bad dreams.

767
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:06,128
I don't think so. I know the difference
between a bad dream and real life, okay?

768
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,287
What'd you see? You saw something, too?

769
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,481
<i>Yes.</i>

770
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,851
Do you guys know that burned-down house
on Harris Avenue?

771
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,722
I was inside when it burned down.

772
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,648
Before I was rescued, my mom and dad were
trapped in the next room over from me.

773
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:31,482
They were pushing and pounding on the door,

774
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,245
trying to get to me.

775
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,481
<i>Hurry, son!</i>

776
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,927
<i>It burns!</i>

777
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,211
But it was too hot.

778
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,923
When the firemen finally found them,

779
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:51,848
the skin on their hands had
melted down to the bone.

780
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,250
We're all afraid of something.

781
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,091
Got that right.

782
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,683
<i>Why, Rich? What are you afraid of?</i>

783
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,571
Clowns.

784
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,887
Okay.

785
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,247
Look.

786
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,043
<i>That's where Georgie disappeared.</i>

787
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,043
<i>There's the Ironworks.</i>

788
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,810
<i>And The Black Spot.</i>

789
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,042
Everywhere it happens,
it's all connected by the sewers.

790
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:53,727
And they all meet up at the...

791
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,126
The well house.

792
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,401
It's in the house on Neibolt Street.

793
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,569
You mean that creepy-ass house where
all the junkies and hobos like to sleep?

794
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,123
<i>I hate that place.</i>

795
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,802
It always feels like it's watching me.

796
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,447
<i>That's where I saw It.</i>

797
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,890
That's where I saw the clown.

798
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,285
That's where It lives.

799
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,601
<i>I can't imagine anything
ever wanting to live there.</i>

800
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,046
Can we stop talking about this?

801
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,129
I can barely breathe.

802
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,561
<i>This is summer.</i>

803
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,410
We're kids. I can barely breathe.

804
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,931
I'm up here having a fucking asthma attack.

805
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,771
I'm not doing this.

806
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,965
What the hell? Put the map back.

807
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,521
Mmm-mmm.

808
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,765
What happened?

809
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,446
What's going on?

810
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,486
I got it. Hold on.

811
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,327
Guys.

812
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:57,920
Georgie.

813
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,327
<i>Bill?</i>

814
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,526
<i>What the fuck?</i>

815
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,481
<i>It's It!</i>

816
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,804
What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?

817
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,327
I don't fucking know!

818
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,644
Turn it off! Turn it off!

819
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,683
Yeah. Yeah, turn it off. Turn it off!

820
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,046
<i>Run, Stanley!</i>

821
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,526
What is it?

822
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,847
<i>What the fuck?</i>

823
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,041
Thanks, Ben.

824
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,526
It saw us.

825
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,211
It saw us, and it knows where we are.

826
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:23,841
It always did.

827
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,930
So, let's go.

828
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,767
Go?

829
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,441
Go where?

830
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,727
Neibolt.

831
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,369
That's where Georgie is.

832
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,886
After that?

833
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,881
Yeah, it's summer. We should be outside.

834
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,930
If you say it's summer
one more fucking time...

835
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,641
<i>Bill!</i>

836
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,931
Wait!

837
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,681
"He thrusts his fists

838
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,848
"against the posts

839
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:30,243
"and still insists he sees..."

840
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:32,527
Bill!

841
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,329
Bill, you can't go in there.

842
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,527
This is crazy.

843
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,524
Look, you don't have to come in with me.

844
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,808
But what happens when
another Georgie goes missing?

845
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,043
Or another Betty?
Or another Ed Corcoran? Or one of us?

846
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,128
Are you just gonna pretend it isn't
happening like everyone else in this town?

847
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,089
Because I can't.

848
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:01,964
I go home, and all I see is
that Georgie isn't there.

849
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,966
His clothes, his toys,
his stupid stuffed animals, but...

850
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,165
<i>He isn't.</i>

851
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,723
So walking into this house,

852
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,404
for me,

853
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,126
it's easier than walking into my own.

854
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,481
<i>Wow.</i>

855
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,761
<i>What?</i>

856
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,445
He didn't stutter once.

857
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,647
Wait!

858
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,206
Um...

859
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,809
Shouldn't we have some people keep watch?

860
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,685
You know, just in case something bad happens?

861
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,326
Who wants to stay out here?

862
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,641
Fuck.

863
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,528
I can't believe I pulled the short straw.

864
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,364
<i>You guys are lucky
you're not measuring dicks.</i>

865
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,005
<i>Shut up, Richie.</i>

866
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,045
<i>I can smell it.</i>

867
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,131
Don't breathe through your mouth.

868
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,361
How come?

869
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,484
Because then you're eating it.

870
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,241
What?

871
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,730
It... It says I'm missing.

872
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,885
You're not missing, Richie.

873
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,445
"Police department, City of Derry."

874
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,206
That's my shirt. That's my hair.
That's my face.

875
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,441
Calm down, this isn't real.

876
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,886
That's my name. That's my age!
That's the date!

877
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,081
It can't be real, Richie.

878
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,771
No, it says it! What the fuck?

879
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,446
- Am I missing? Am I gonna go missing?
- Calm down. Calm down.

880
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,523
Look at me, Richie. Look at me.

881
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,443
That... That isn't real.

882
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,603
It's playing tricks on you.

883
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,760
<i>Hello?</i>

884
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,571
<i>Hello?</i>

885
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,643
<i>Help me, please!</i>

886
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,161
Betty?

887
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:09,761
Ripsom?

888
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,491
<i>Eddie...</i>

889
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,527
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

890
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,365
Guys, can you hear that?

891
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,803
<i>She was just here. Where the fuck did she go?</i>

892
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,360
Guys.

893
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,644
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

894
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,211
Guys. Guys!

895
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,881
- <i>Guys! Guys!</i>
- What? Eddie?

896
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,289
What the fuck?

897
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,371
Time to take your pill, Eddie.

898
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,446
- Eddie. Open the door!
- <i>Richie.</i>

899
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,486
<i>You okay?</i>

900
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,441
<i>Eddie, what's going on?</i>

901
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,761
Eds.

902
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,601
<i>Eddie.</i>

903
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,281
<i>Come here, Richie.</i>

904
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:51,807
Eddie.

905
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,447
<i>Eddie.</i>

906
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,165
Eddie.

907
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,165
Where the fuck are you?

908
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,324
<i>We're not playing hide-and-seek, dipshit.</i>

909
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:11,967
Richie?

910
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,291
Richie! Richie!

911
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:17,487
Bill, come on, open the door.

912
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,761
<i>It won't open!</i>

913
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,445
- <i>What's going on? Richie!</i>
- I can't!

914
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,687
<i>Open the door, Rich.</i>

915
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,801
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

916
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,845
Stupid clowns.

917
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,881
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

918
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,321
<i>Ugh!</i>

919
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,406
Beep-beep, Richie.

920
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,961
Let's get outta here.

921
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,371
You wanna play loogie?

922
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,560
Time to float.

923
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,441
<i>Where's my shoe?</i>

924
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,487
Where the fuck were her legs?

925
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,329
Holy shit, what the fuck was that?

926
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,481
This isn't real.

927
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,966
Remember the missing kid poster.

928
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,730
That wasn't real, so this isn't real.

929
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,523
Tasty, tasty, beautiful fear.

930
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:57,881
Come on. Ready?

931
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,087
<i>No!</i>

932
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,521
No.

933
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,400
No, no!

934
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,800
Oh, thank fuck.

935
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,367
- <i>Where's Eddie?</i>
- <i>Help!</i>

936
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,045
<i>Help!</i>

937
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,361
Eddie!

938
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,924
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

939
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,161
Eddie!

940
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,721
This isn't real enough for you, Billy?

941
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,730
I'm not real enough for you?

942
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,405
Oh, shit.

943
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:33,047
It was real enough for Georgie.

944
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:37,481
Holy shit!

945
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,886
- Get Eddie!
- Get Eddie!

946
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,681
Oh, fuck! We gotta get out of here!

947
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,881
- <i>Get Eddie. Let's go!</i>
- <i>Guys, watch out!</i>

948
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,969
- No, no, no, no!
- Eddie, look at me!

949
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,043
He's gonna get us! Guys!

950
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,571
<i>No!</i>

951
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,604
<i>Ben!</i>

952
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,801
Ben!

953
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,447
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

954
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:25,931
Don't let him get away!

955
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,771
<i>Bill, we have to help Eddie!</i>

956
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,610
No! No!

957
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:41,965
I'm gonna snap your arm into place.

958
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,201
Rich, do not fucking touch me.

959
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,808
- Okay, one, two, three.
- Do not touch me!

960
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,124
Holy shit!

961
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,647
You. You did this.

962
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,724
You know how delicate he is.

963
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,884
- We were attacked, Mrs. K.
- No. Don't.

964
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,643
Don't try and blame anyone else.

965
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,526
- Let me help.
- Get back!

966
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,803
Oh, I've heard of you, Miss Marsh.

967
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,049
And I don't want a dirty girl like you
touching my son.

968
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,925
Mrs. K, I...

969
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,164
No! You are all monsters. All of you.

970
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:25,331
And Eddie is done with you.
Do you hear? Done!

971
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:51,281
I saw the well.

972
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,443
We know where it is

973
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:56,286
and next time we'll be better prepared.

974
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,521
No!

975
01:27:58,360 --> 01:27:59,521
No next time, Bill.

976
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,684
- You're insane.
- <i>Why?</i>

977
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,406
We all know no one else
is going to do anything.

978
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,887
Eddie was nearly killed!
And look at this motherfucker.

979
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,923
He's leaking Hamburger Helper!

980
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,201
<i>We can't pretend it's gonna go away.</i>

981
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,125
Ben, you said it yourself,
It comes back every 27 years.

982
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:17,205
Fine! I'll be 40 and far away from here.

983
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,163
I thought you said you wanted to
get out of this town, too.

984
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,205
Because I wanna run towards something.
Not away.

985
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,848
I'm sorry, who invited Molly Ringwald
into the group?

986
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,168
- Richie...
- I'm just saying, let's face facts.

987
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:30,401
Real world.

988
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,251
Georgie is dead.
Stop trying to get us killed, too.

989
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,441
Georgie's not dead.

990
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,240
You couldn't save him,
but you can still save yourself.

991
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,246
No, take it back.

992
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:46,243
You're scared and we all are,
but take it back!

993
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,881
Bill!

994
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,528
You're just a bunch of losers!

995
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,921
- Fuck off!
- Richie, stop.

996
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,043
You're just a bunch of losers
and you'll get yourselves killed

997
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,368
- trying to catch a fucking stupid clown.
- Stop!

998
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,124
This is what It wants.

999
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,640
It wants to divide us.

1000
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:11,080
We were all together when we hurt It.

1001
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,288
That's why we're still alive.

1002
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:16,131
Yeah? Well, I plan to keep it that way.

1003
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,963
- Mike...
- Guys...

1004
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,242
I can't do this.

1005
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,490
My granddad was right.

1006
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,645
I'm an outsider. Gotta stay that way.

1007
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,970
- Yeah! Bonus!
- Yeah, there we go.

1008
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,645
Put the next target out there.

1009
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,450
<i>Just hold it.</i>

1010
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,883
What the hell's going on here?

1011
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,723
Just cleaning your gun, like you asked.

1012
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,407
You're cleaning my gun, huh?

1013
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:14,202
- Dad...
- Hey!

1014
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,210
Look at him now, boys.

1015
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,881
Ain't nothing like a little fear
to make a paper man crumble.

1016
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,481
<i>Here for the refills, Eddie?</i>

1017
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,681
Yeah.

1018
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,251
<i>You know it's all bullshit, right?</i>

1019
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,681
What is?

1020
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:57,441
Your medication.

1021
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,331
<i>They're placebos.</i>

1022
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,521
What's placebo mean?

1023
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,205
Placebo means bullshit.

1024
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:06,440
No friends, huh?

1025
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:08,401
<i>Your cast.</i>

1026
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,485
No signatures or anything?

1027
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:11,961
So sad.

1028
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,850
I didn't want it to get dirty.

1029
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,085
I'll sign it for you.

1030
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:35,845
You okay, Henry?

1031
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:48,769
<i>And this is my most</i>
<i>favorite part of the afternoon.</i>

1032
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,850
<i>Getting to know all about so many of you.</i>

1033
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,003
<i>Is there someone here
that wants to share with us</i>

1034
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,964
- <i>what they most enjoyed about today?</i>
- <i>Me!</i>

1035
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,607
- <i>How about you?</i>
- <i>I liked seeing the clown.</i>

1036
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,767
- <i>You did? You liked the clown?</i>
- <i>Yes!</i>

1037
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,006
- <i>What about the rest of you?</i>
- <i>I liked when the bubbles float.</i>

1038
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,129
<i>You did? Me too.</i>

1039
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,562
<i>I just love watching things float.</i>

1040
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:10,761
<i>We all float.</i>

1041
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,160
<i>That's right.</i>

1042
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:14,442
<i>And you will, too, Henry.</i>

1043
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,483
<i>Make it a wonderful day.</i>

1044
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,011
<i>Kill him.</i>

1045
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:21,082
<i>Kill him. Kill him.</i>

1046
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,370
<i>Kill him. Kill him.</i>

1047
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:26,450
<i>Kill him. Kill him.</i>

1048
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,691
<i>Oh, no. Give a big round of applause!</i>

1049
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:39,245
<i>Well done, Henry.</i>

1050
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:42,643
<i>Kill them all. Kill them all.</i>

1051
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,963
<i>Kill them all!</i>

1052
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,931
<i>Kill them all! Kill them all! Kill them all!</i>

1053
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:53,483
<i>Kill them all! Kill them all! Kill them all!</i>

1054
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,801
<i>Where are you sneaking off to?</i>

1055
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,450
Nowhere, Daddy.

1056
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,248
You're looking prettied up.

1057
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,568
I'm not prettied up, Daddy.
I wear this almost every day.

1058
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,051
Come.

1059
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:53,371
<i>You know I worry about you, Bevvie.</i>

1060
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,121
I know.

1061
01:35:55,640 --> 01:36:00,442
People in town have been
saying some things to me about you.

1062
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:04,529
Sneaking around all summer long
with a bunch of boys.

1063
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:06,889
<i>The only girl in the pack.</i>

1064
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:09,526
They're just friends, I swear.

1065
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:15,569
I know what's in boys' minds
when they look at you, Bevvie.

1066
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,842
I know all too well.

1067
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,844
My hand...

1068
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:25,485
Are you doing womanly things
down in the woods with those boys?

1069
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:29,287
No, no, no, nothing.
You don't have to worry. I promise.

1070
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,921
What's this?

1071
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,528
It's nothing. It's just a poem.

1072
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,327
Just a poem?

1073
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,881
But you had to hide it
in your underwear drawer.

1074
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:43,491
Why would you have to hide it there?

1075
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,165
Are you still my girl?

1076
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,601
No.

1077
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:49,881
What did you say?

1078
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:52,329
I said, no!

1079
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,481
No!

1080
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,769
Get away, no!

1081
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:03,045
Get off!

1082
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,561
No!

1083
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:10,921
Those boys. Do they know that you're my...

1084
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:37,810
Beverly?

1085
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,371
Beverly!

1086
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,327
- Richie.
- What do you want?

1087
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,207
<i>See that guy I'm hitting?
I'm pretending it's you.</i>

1088
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:20,641
It got Beverly.

1089
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:22,285
What are you talking about?

1090
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,125
It, Richie.

1091
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,524
It got Beverly.

1092
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,447
Hello?

1093
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:47,600
Okay.

1094
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,685
I'll meet you there.

1095
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:58,851
And just where do you think you're off to?

1096
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,327
Out with my friends.

1097
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,521
Sweetie, you can't go.

1098
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,410
You're getting over your sickness, remember?

1099
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:07,645
My sickness?

1100
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,763
Okay, what sickness, Ma?

1101
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,606
You know what these are? They're gazebos!

1102
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,961
They're bullshit!

1103
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,289
They help you, Eddie.

1104
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:26,884
I had to protect you.

1105
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,451
Protect me?

1106
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:31,610
By lying to me? By keeping me locked
inside this hellhole?

1107
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,211
I'm sorry but the only people that were

1108
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,602
actually trying to protect me
were my friends.

1109
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,042
And you made me turn my back on them
when I really needed them.

1110
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:39,241
So I'm going.

1111
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:42,210
Eddie. Eddie. No.

1112
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:43,447
You get back here.

1113
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,444
- Sorry, Mom, I gotta go save my friends.
- Eddie!

1114
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:47,284
Don't do this to me, Eddie!

1115
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,121
Guys, spikes.

1116
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,601
Stan?

1117
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,969
Stan, we all have to go.

1118
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,288
<i>Beverly was right.</i>

1119
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:16,006
If we split up like last time,
that clown will kill us one by one.

1120
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,845
<i>But if we stick together,</i>

1121
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,646
all of us,

1122
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,891
we'll win.

1123
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:27,761
<i>I promise.</i>

1124
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:57,131
Hey, Eddie, you got a quarter?

1125
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:00,842
I wouldn't want to make a wish
in that fucking thing.

1126
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,524
Beverly?

1127
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:08,926
How are we supposed to get down there?

1128
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,525
All right. Come on.

1129
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:30,811
All right.

1130
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:13,088
Guys, guys. Help.

1131
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:16,685
- All right, buddy?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1132
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,250
<i>Step right up, Beverly. Step right up.</i>

1133
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:29,440
<i>Come change. Come float.
You'll laugh. You'll cry.</i>

1134
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:33,088
<i>You'll cheer. You'll die.</i>

1135

01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:14,764
I'm not afraid of you.

1137
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,211
You will be.

1138
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:38,486
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

1139
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:49,560
Ahhh!

1140
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,041
Die!

1141
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,247
Mike!

1142
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:56,931
- Mike!
- Mike!

1143
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:59,290
<i>You okay? Mike!</i>

1144
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:00,801
<i>Bowers.</i>

1145
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,407
Mike. Fuck.

1146
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,331
- <i>Mike!</i>
- <i>Where is he?</i>

1147
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:07,841
<i>We're next.</i>

1148
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:09,651
<i>No, no, no!</i>

1149
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,046
- Grab it!
- Get the rope! Get the rope!

1150
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:12,761
Oh, shit.

1151
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:15,611
- <i>Mike!</i>
- <i>Mike!</i>

1152
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,011
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

1153
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:21,802
You didn't listen to what I told you,
did you?

1154
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:25,806
You should've stayed out of Derry.

1155
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:28,850
Your parents didn't
and look what happened to them.

1156
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:32,531
I still get sad every time
I pass by that pile of ashes.

1157
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,206
Sad,

1158
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,651
that I couldn't have done it myself.

1159
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,250
<i>Run, Mike!</i>

1160
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:46,920
Mike!

1161
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:49,241
Fuck down!

1162
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:54,328
I should get up there.

1163
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,648
Are you insane? With what?

1164
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:26,571
<i>Holy shit.</i>

1165
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:30,450
- Oh, my...
- Mike!

1166
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,485
I'm okay.

1167
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:34,245
<i>I'm okay.</i>

1168
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:39,401
Shoot!

1169
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,525
<i>Stanley.</i>

<i>Is that you?</i>

1172
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:58,807
Guys?

1173
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,527
Guys?

1174
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:09,963
- What?
- Guys, where's Stan?

1175
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:11,161
Stanley!

1176
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,600
Stanley!

1177
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:13,807
Stan!

1178
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,005
Oh, shit. Greywater.

1179
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,001
Stan?

1180
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:23,087
Stan?

1181
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:25,361
Stanley!

1182
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:51,884
- Stan!
- Shit! Stan!

1183
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,007
Stanley!

1184
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,450
- We're coming, man!
- We're coming! Don't worry.

1185
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,161
- Stan?
- Stanley! Stan!

1186
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:03,361
His flashlight!

1187
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:09,004
<i>What the fuck is that thing?</i>

1188
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:10,321
Oh, shit.

1189
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:17,681
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1190
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:26,241
Oh, shit!

<i>Oh, shit!</i>

1192
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,167
Stanley!

1193
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:32,169
- Stanley! Stan!
- Stanley!

1194
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:35,489
No! No! No!

1195
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:36,687
It's okay.

1196
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:39,764
You left me! You took me into Neibolt!

1197
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:41,007
You're not my friends!

1198
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:43,043
You made me go into Neibolt!

1199
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:45,965
- <i>Stanley, I'm sorry.</i>
- <i>You made me go into Neibolt!</i>

1200
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,570
<i>This is your fault.</i>

1201
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,244
<i>We would never let anything happen to you.</i>

1202
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:55,481
<i>We're here for you.</i>

1203
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:58,923
You know we wouldn't do that to you. Come on.

1204
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:01,202
Bill! Bill!

1205
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:03,161
Bill!

1206
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:04,560
<i>Bill!</i>

1207
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:37,806
Beverly!

1208
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:05,925
I'll come back for you, Bev.

1209
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:14,881
Bill!

1210
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,081
Bill!

1211
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:23,007
Bill!

1212
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:24,646
<i>Come on.</i>

1213
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,205
Get out of there, dude. That's greywater.

1214
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,562
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God, my fucking flashlight?

1215
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:30,404
Eddie!

1216
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,167
Come on, let's get the fuck
out of here! Come on!

1217
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:56,324
- Holy shit.
- Bev? Bev?

1218
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:58,850
- Beverly?
- Holy shit.

1219
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:00,761
Bev.

1220
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,689
<i>How is she in the air?</i>

1221
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:12,205
Guys.

1222
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,607
Are those...

1223
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:16,886
<i>The missing kids.</i>

1224
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:19,041
<i>Floating.</i>

1225
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:22,563
- Just let me grab her.
- Shit.

1226
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:29,486
<i>I'm slipping.</i>

1227
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:38,881
Bev.

1228
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:41,571
Beverly.

1229
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:43,404
Why isn't she waking up?

1230
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,324
What is wrong with her?

1231
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:47,642
Beverly, please! Come on!

1232
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:01,967
Wow.

1233
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:07,841
<i>Bev?</i>

1234
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:13,931
"January embers"

1235
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:16,647
"My heart burns there too"

1236
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:20,603
Jesus, fuck.

1237
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,491
Oh, God.

1238
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:34,005
Where's Bill?

1239
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:39,886
<i>Georgie.</i>

1240
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:44,891
What took you so long?

1241
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:52,005
I was looking for you this whole time.

1242
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:56,405
I couldn't find my way outta here.

1243
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,726
He said I could have my boat back, Billy.

1244
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,606
Was she fast?

1245
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,687
I couldn't keep up with it.

1246
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,161
"She," Georgie.

1247
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:19,810
You call boats "she."

1248
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:24,528
Take me home, Billy.

1249
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,370
I wanna go home.

1250
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:40,721
<i>I miss you. I wanna be with Mom and Dad.</i>

1251
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:46,202
I want more than anything for you to be home.

1252
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:51,530
With Mom and Dad.

1253
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:56,046
I miss you so much.

1254
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:02,604
I love you, Billy.

1255
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:05,645
I love you, too.

1256
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:16,125
But you're not Georgie.

1257
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,447
- Kill It, Bill! Kill It!
- <i>Shit.</i>

1258
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,330
<i>Kill It, Bill!</i>

1259
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,406
Kill It! Bill, Kill It!

1260
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:10,321
<i>Kill It!</i>

1261
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:11,481
- Kill It!
- Kill!

1262
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:12,641
Kill It!

1263
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:14,201
It's not loaded.

1264
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:16,647
Do it now, Bill! Kill It! Kill It!

1265
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,491
Hey! It's not loaded!

1266
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,005
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

1267
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:26,370
Oh, shit.

1268
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:34,921
<i>Bill, watch out!</i>

1269
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:39,601
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

1270
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:42,641
<i>Beverly, no!</i>

1271
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:43,881
<i>Mike!</i>

1272
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:50,281
<i>Help him!</i>

1273
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:52,170
Fuck!

1274
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:54,921
Ben!

1275
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:01,403
<i>Stanley!</i>

1276
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:09,366
Bill!

1277
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:11,681
<i>Bill!</i>

1278
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:13,765
<i>No, don't.</i>

1279
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:15,521
Let him go.

1280
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:16,847
No.

1281
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,889
I'll take him.

1282
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:21,048
I'll take all of you.

1283
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:26,050
<i>And I'll feast on your flesh
as I feed on your fear.</i>

1284
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:31,204
Or,

1285
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:35,202
you'll just leave us be.

1286
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:38,443
I will take him, only him

1287
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,202
and then I will have my long rest

1288
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:45,530
and you will all live to grow and thrive

1289
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:49,242
and lead happy lives

1290
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:53,601
until old age takes you back to the weeds.

1291
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:58,646
Leave...

1292
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:03,048
I'm the one who dragged you all into this.

1293
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:05,922
I'm so sorry.

1294
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:07,167
<i>Sorry.</i>

1295
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:13,728
Go!

1296
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:16,971
Guys, we can't!

1297
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:20,564
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1298
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:24,491
I told you, Bill.

1299
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:26,246
<i>I fucking told you.</i>

1300
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:29,243
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

1301
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,251
It's your fault.

1302
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:35,603
You punched me in the face.

1303
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,285
You made me walk through shitty water.

1304
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:38,965
You brought me to a fucking crackhead house.

1305
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:41,931
And now...

1306
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:47,324
I'm gonna have to kill this fucking clown.

1307
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,764
Welcome to the Losers' Club, asshole!

1308
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:58,925
- Mike!
- Mike!

1309
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:05,847
<i>Stan, watch out!</i>

1310
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:09,681
Mike!

1311
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:20,161
<i>Kill him!</i>

1312
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:50,529
I'm gonna kill you!

1313
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:58,885
<i>Hey, Bevvie. Are you still my little...</i>

1314
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:09,521
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

1315
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:31,528
That's why you didn't kill Beverly.

1316
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:36,049
'Cause she wasn't afraid.

1317
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:38,524
<i>And we aren't either.</i>

1318
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:40,765
<i>Not anymore.</i>

1319
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:45,282
Now you're the one who's afraid.

1320
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:48,565
Because you're gonna starve.

1321
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:58,251
<i>"He thrusts his fists against the posts</i>

1322
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:01,882
<i>"and still insists he sees the ghosts</i>

1323
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:05,164
<i>"He thrusts his fists against the posts"</i>

1324
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:25,767
Fear...

1325
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:40,530
I know what I'm doing
for my summer experience essay.

1326
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:55,408
Guys. Guys.

1327
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:59,122
The kids are floating down.

1328
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:20,286
I can only remember parts,

1329
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:23,130
I thought I was dead.

1330
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,290
That's what it felt like.

1331
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:30,723
I saw us, all of us together
back in the cistern,

1332
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:32,809
but we were older,

1333
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:35,522
like, our parents' ages.

1334
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:39,882
What were we all doing there?

1335
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:42,488
I just remember how we felt.

1336
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,764
<i>How scared we were.</i>

1337
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:48,327
I don't think I can ever forget that.

1338
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:54,721
Swear it.

1339
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:57,086
Swear

1340
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:59,603
if It isn't dead,

1341
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:03,728
if It ever comes back, we'll come back, too.

1342
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:29,647
<i>I gotta go.</i>

1343
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:33,481
I hate you.

1344
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:45,604
I'll see you later.

1345
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:46,921
<i>Bye, Stan.</i>

1346
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:53,607
Bye, guys.

1347
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:56,001
- Bye, Mike.
- See you later, losers.

1348
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,207
- See you around, Bill.
- See you, Rich.

1349
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:01,441
See you guys later.

1350
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:04,611
Bye, Ben.

1351
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:12,045
You all packed for Portland?

1352
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:15,202
Yeah, pretty much.

1353
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:16,880
I'm going tomorrow morning.

1354
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:18,883
How long will you be gone?

1355
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:24,725
My aunt, she says I can stay
for as long as I want, so...

1356
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:29,245
Just so you know...

1357
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:33,488
I never felt like a loser
when I was with all of you.

1358
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:45,365
See you around.

1359
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:34,121
Bye.

1360
02:08:35,305 --> 02:09:35,693
