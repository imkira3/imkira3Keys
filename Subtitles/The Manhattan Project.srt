2
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:19,584
Now, the beta synchrotron
sends the electrons through this magnet,

3
00:01:19,684 --> 00:01:22,254
which bends the course of them
down to the reaction vessel.

4
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:24,131
Stay away from that elbow joint.

5
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:26,733
All right. Bran, you wanna get that?

6
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:33,365
Now, this is a tunable excimer laser.

7
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:36,210
It's tuned to the exact resonance
of the plutonium-239

8
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,630
that's in that reaction vessel,
down that end. Now,

9
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:43,017
if we're all set, and hit it.

10
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:06,740
Now, watch your eyes. Roper!

11
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:13,080
This is where electrons bombard the stuff.

12
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:16,110
Lasers ionize it
and send it off to the condenser.

13
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:18,661
Now it's a conductive element.

14
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:34,802
Now to the condenser.

15
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:40,069
Here it gets converted
into its liquid metallic state.

16
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,039
Would you repeat that, please?

17
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:44,841
This is where it's converted

18
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:48,390
into its liquid metallic state.

19
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:52,679
This all happened about 50 seconds ago.

20
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:08,452
It's the purest plutonium in the universe.

21
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:12,532
Pretty, isn't it?

22
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:31,558
- 99%?
- No.

23
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:39,226
99.997.

24
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:50,636
Bob, what do you think?

25
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:54,115
A weapon this big with 20 times the punch
of anything anybody's got?

26
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:56,267
- Is he kidding?
- No, he did it, all right.

27
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,144
It's a brilliant achievement.

28
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:00,918
- He'd get the Nobel if he could publish.
- Publish?

29
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:02,414
I said "if."

30
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:08,028
All right. I want a prototype facility fully
operational, before Geneva if possible.

31
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:12,491
Everything goes through Energy in
Washington, need-to-know, SCI clearance.

32
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:17,037
Set him up. Whatever he needs.
Someplace quiet. Away from prying eyes.

33
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:19,639
And keep an eye on him.

34
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,457
Here we go.

35
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:05,614
Hi, Mom.

36
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:08,200
Paul, it's 4:30 in the morning.

37
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:11,457
What's the book?

38
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:13,918
I don't know. Some cheap novel.

39
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:17,217
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

40
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,233
Be careful, it's hot.

41
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,735
What? What's the matter?

42
00:07:43,026 --> 00:07:44,403
You're growing so fast.

43
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:47,785
Yeah, but that's no reason
to have a nervous breakdown.

44
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,872
Come here.

45
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:56,670
We got to get you a Valium
or some heroin or something.

46
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,184
Hurry up. He's coming.

47
00:09:31,677 --> 00:09:33,771
- What is that?
- Nitrogen triiodide.

48
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:36,790
- What does it do?
- Unstable with respect to shock.

49
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,377
- Well, what does that mean?
- Once it dries, if you touch it, it explodes.

50
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:43,481
- You're crazy!
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

51
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,510
- Whose drawer?
- Roland's.

52
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,159
- Poor Roland.
- No, he'll love it. Builds character.

53
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:54,829
He's coming!

54
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:58,187
Hiya, Roland,
could I borrow your English notes?

55
00:09:58,287 --> 00:09:59,521
You've got to be kidding me.

56
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:01,874
But I lent you my math homework
at least 10 times.

57
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,276
Sorry, Stephens,
it's a dog-eat-dog world out there.

58
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:05,923
I gotta look out for number one.

59
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,518
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

60
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:15,704
Last time, we learned that plutonium

61
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:18,498
is perfectly suited for
the release of enormous amounts of energy

62
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:23,654
due to its ability to fission under
the action of slow neutrons.

63
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:26,819
Now, here we have the isotope

64
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,987
plutonium-239.

65
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,742
And here,

66
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:38,018
we have two very interesting
inventions based on this.

67
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:42,749
Now, can anyone tell us the principle
behind the implosion device?

68
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:45,588
Paul, can you enlighten us?

69
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:51,923
Yes, Roland.

70
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:57,162
Yes. Your implosion design simply
uses a chemical high explosive

71
00:10:57,262 --> 00:11:00,499
to squeeze a subcritical piece
of weapons-grade plutonium-239

72
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:04,319
until it's supercritical, thereby
producing an atomic explosion.

73
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:06,939
- Thank you, Roland.
- Thank you, Mr. Wilke.

74
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:14,120
He did it. Him! Paul Stephens is sick.

75
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:25,795
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

76
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,797
Hi, Jen.

77
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:30,320
- Hi, Paul.
- Did you lose something?

78
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,156
It's so dumb. I locked my car keys
in the glove compartment

79
00:11:33,256 --> 00:11:36,285
because I always lose them. So, now I've
lost the keys to the glove compartment.

80
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:37,386
Dumb, right?

81
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:39,346
You got a nail file in there?

82
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:41,640
- Yeah, why?
- Let me see it.

83
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,627
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't worry about it.

84
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:47,695
- It's a new car.
- Trust me.

85
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:52,676
That was terrible, you know?

86
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:53,993
- What?
- Roland.

87
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:56,700
Terrible? I thought it was very effective.

88
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:04,997
Not bad. Thank you.

89
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:08,859
- Where did you learn that?
- CIA child recruitment program.

90
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,610
Listen, what you are doing Sunday night?

91
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,927
Nothing, why?

92
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:15,056
- You wanna study?
- You mean together?

93
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:17,017
What about Mr. Perfect?

94
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:20,020
Who, Eric? Don't worry about Eric.
He's just pretty.

95
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:22,435
- What do you say?
- Sure.

96
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:26,022
My house.
115 North Highland near Thurston.

97
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:28,361
You gonna write it down?

98
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:33,741
8:00, all right?
I'll have to babysit my little brother.

99
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:36,282
Babysitting. Does he bite?

100
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:39,122
No. I'm the one that bites.

101
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:47,123
Yo!

102
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:51,593
Hey, Stephens, how about it?

103
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,059
- Excuse me, Doctor?
- Yeah?

104
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:05,732
Hi, I'm Elizabeth Stephens.

105
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:07,793
Hi.

106
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:09,315
- Please have a seat.
- Thanks.

107
00:13:11,062 --> 00:13:13,548
Could you spell this for me, Doctor?
I can't seem to read your writing.

108
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:15,592
M-A-T-H-E-W-S-O-N.

109
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:17,490
John Mathewson.

110
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:21,306
And you're interested in
a one-bedroom sublet, furnished.

111
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:22,849
- Yeah.
- Any special requirements?

112
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:25,668
It should be quiet and
in an English-speaking country.

113
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:28,330
I think we can handle that.

114
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,816
- Children?
- No.

115
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,692
- No children.
- Pets?

116
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,987
No pets, no children, no flamenco dancing.

117
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:38,865
- So it's just you and...
- Just me and my books.

118
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,638
And my memories, of course.

119
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:46,982
We have a very nice garden condominium.

120
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:48,667
On sublet.

121
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:52,570
New building. Good neighborhood.
$500 a month, including utilities.

122
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:54,898
- The particulars are inside.
- No, no. That's okay.

123
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,489
- You don't like it?
- I love it. I'll take it.

124
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:00,137
- You'll take it?
- Yeah.

125
00:14:00,237 --> 00:14:01,346
Just like that.

126
00:14:01,446 --> 00:14:04,325
- Without looking at it?
- Well, you said it was nice, didn't you?

127
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,685
Well...

128
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:09,254
Okay. That was easy.

129
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:12,957
I'm very easy.

130
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:20,031
Well, so that's that.

131
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:22,033
If there's anything else I can do...

132
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:23,910
- As a matter of fact, there is one thing.
- Yes?

133
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,370
Can I ask you a question?

134
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,997
- Okay.
- The thing is,

135
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:31,084
I've been here for six weeks
down at the Carriage House Motel,

136
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:33,983
and I don't know a soul in town,
and you've been so nice.

137
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:36,649
I thought...

138
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:40,868
Perhaps some night
you'll let me buy you dinner?

139
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:43,054
- Is that crazy?
- I can't. No.

140
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:45,307
- No? Really?
- It's sweet of you, but it's quite impossible.

141
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:47,142
No, no. Hey! I understand.

142
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:49,461
You have something.

143
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:53,064
Well, if you'll excuse me,

144
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:56,543
I'll go back to my room
and watch them rewrap the soap.

145
00:14:57,836 --> 00:15:00,655
- It's not that bad, is it?
- It's not wonderful.

146
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:02,098
Paul, come say hi.

147
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:04,684
Dr. Mathewson, this is my son, Paul.

148
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:08,146
Your son? I didn't realize you...

149
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:12,980
- This is terrible. I feel like a perfect ass.
- Nobody's perfect.

150
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:17,797
I'm sorry. That was not called for.

151
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:20,275
As a matter of fact,
my husband and I are separated.

152
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:24,078
I mean...

153
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:27,998
Hi, Paul. I'm John.

154
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:33,271
You a science buff?

155
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:36,375
Lasers. Fantastic things, lasers.

156
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:39,569
You ever seen one in the flesh?

157
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:41,171
- No.
- Would you like to?

158
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:42,906
Sure.

159
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:44,533
Well, the funny coincidence is

160
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:48,058
I have access to the sexiest lasers
in the entire free world.

161
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:53,316
If your mom says it's okay,
you can come down to the lab

162
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,070
and I will give you the grand tour.
Laser heaven.

163
00:15:58,063 --> 00:16:00,757
In return, I get to take you
and your mom to dinner.

164
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:02,234
Sunday. Deal?

165
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,557
State your name and business.

166
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:12,888
Hi. My name is Paul Stephens,
and I'm here to see Dr. Mathewson.

167
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:16,225
Go through the gate
and up to the main building.

168
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,773
Would you put these on and see
that gentleman over there, please?

169
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,112
Thank you.

170
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,611
The laser will fire in 12 minutes.

171
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:28,679
Please clear the active areas.

172
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:51,448
- What are those things?
- Motion detectors.

173
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:53,263
Really? What do they do?

174
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:55,206
Anything that moves, they detect it.

175
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:39,538
Three yellow suits
to the loading dock, please.

176
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:42,249
Jack, pick up on five.

177
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:45,298
Harry, seven-two, seven-two.

178
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,756
Dr. Mathewson.

179
00:21:43,908 --> 00:21:45,310
So, what do you think?

180
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,812
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

181
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:50,857
I just cut through
a steel plate with a beam of light!

182
00:21:50,957 --> 00:21:52,834
He says it's not bad.

183
00:21:56,337 --> 00:21:59,699
A copper vapor laser,
the most powerful that I've worked with.

184
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:02,160
Here's the main reaction chamber.

185
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,537
Reaction column.

186
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:06,080
Vacuum assembly.

187
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,500
Everything back there
in the cage is the assay area.

188
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,102
Everything's run by the robot.

189
00:22:12,437 --> 00:22:15,214
What did your old man do for a living?

190
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:17,508
He taught architecture at Cornell.

191
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:18,801
- What's that?
- What?

192
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:21,596
- That stuff.
- Lubricating oil for the robot.

193
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,640
No, no, no.
That green stuff in those bottles.

194
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,975
That. That's americium-241.

195
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:27,685
It's one of the things we make here.
Come on.

196
00:22:27,785 --> 00:22:29,103
I'll show you the grounds.

197
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:31,672
Down by the lake.
It's beautiful down there.

198
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:42,659
- Where's your father now?
- Saudi Arabia.

199
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:45,036
Really? What happened?

200
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:47,309
I guess he didn't like
being married anymore.

201
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:50,708
Some guys don't know
when they are well off.

202
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:54,278
He's a brilliant architect, but he's just
kind of a shit in his personal life.

203
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,549
So are you going to go out with Elizabeth?

204
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:00,322
- Elizabeth?
- My mother.

205
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:02,491
Right, Elizabeth.

206
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:05,741
I don't know. That's pretty much
up to her, I guess.

207
00:23:06,324 --> 00:23:09,168
She's quite an unusual woman,
your mother, don't you think?

208
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,336
- Paul?
- Excuse me?

209
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:21,280
- Your mother?
- Yeah, right.

210
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,677
Very unusual.

211
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,177
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

212
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:32,041
No more. My head is spinning.

213
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:34,836
It's good for the head to spin.
Keeps it stable.

214
00:23:34,936 --> 00:23:36,129
Paul, you haven't even touched yours.

215
00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:38,256
No, thank you. I don't drink wine.

216
00:23:38,356 --> 00:23:41,155
- Why is that?
- It impairs my judgment.

217
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:45,430
What's the matter?

218
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,532
- Air conditioning.
- Here, take my jacket.

219
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:52,291
I left my sweater in Dr. Mathewson's car.
Would you be a sweetheart?

220
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:56,709
So when he was six years old,

221
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,088
he started getting up at 2:00
every morning and staying up.

222
00:25:00,188 --> 00:25:01,714
Here you go, Mom.

223
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:04,533
- Is that better?
- Yes. Thanks, sweetheart.

224
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:07,867
Thank you for dinner.
It was very stimulating.

225
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:09,739
What? Are you leaving? No dessert?

226
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:11,450
Sorry, I have a date.

227
00:25:11,782 --> 00:25:14,126
Wait, wait.
I didn't give you your present.

228
00:25:14,452 --> 00:25:17,730
- Present?
- Yeah. It's a brain-teaser.

229
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,150
You must get each
of the balls in the corners.

230
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,127
A colleague of mine at MIT invented it.

231
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:26,305
He's a games theorist.
He wants to market it.

232
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:29,175
He says anyone who can do it
inside of two minutes...

233
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:38,685
I guess I'm going to have to
come up with something harder.

234
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:45,091
Plus which, there are only
two uses in the world for plutonium.

235
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:47,034
In weapons and in reactors, right?

236
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:49,637
So, if they make reactors,
why say it's medical?

237
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:52,140
And if it's medical, why are they fooling
around with plutonium?

238
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,391
It doesn't make any sense.

239
00:25:53,491 --> 00:25:55,601
How do you know it's plutonium?
Maybe it's something else.

240
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:59,021
It's not. It's little flakes of plutonium
in a green gel. It's called a scintillant.

241
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:01,440
Why invite you inside? It's crazy.

242
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,568
So, he's crazy.
Look what he does for a living.

243
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:06,028
He's hot for my mother.
He figures I'm a dumb kid.

244
00:26:06,128 --> 00:26:09,031
- He's hot for your mother? Really?
- Got a knife or screwdriver?

245
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:10,875
- Last drawer.
- Plus which,

246
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:13,744
he's got all these security clearances.
I don't know what they are.

247
00:26:13,844 --> 00:26:16,914
Los Alamos, Livermore Labs, Oak Ridge.

248
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:20,293
- Do you know what they make at Oak Ridge?
- What?

249
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:22,316
Nuclear warheads.

250
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:27,842
- So, what are you saying?
- I'm saying he lied, okay?

251
00:26:27,942 --> 00:26:29,760
At the very least,
he invites me out there,

252
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,596
and then he lies
like I'm some kind of a wimp.

253
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:33,639
- I think you are overreacting.
- To what?

254
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:35,766
I don't know. Oedipal jealousy maybe.

255
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:38,436
Oedipal jealousy? What's that?
Psychology class?

256
00:26:38,536 --> 00:26:40,379
Does this look like Oedipal jealousy?

257
00:26:41,414 --> 00:26:43,232
- What is that?
- What does it look like?

258
00:26:43,332 --> 00:26:46,611
- A five-leaf clover. Where did you find it?
- Growing outside that lab.

259
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:49,197
You know the odds on that kind of
mutation happening naturally,

260
00:26:49,297 --> 00:26:51,115
without chemicals or radiation
or something?

261
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:52,575
- What?
- There are none.

262
00:26:52,675 --> 00:26:55,453
I looked it up. It's like a billion-to-one.
It never happens.

263
00:26:55,553 --> 00:26:56,930
Maybe you're just very lucky.

264
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:04,879
Oh, my God. Who knows about this?

265
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:07,340
- Just us.
- We should do something.

266
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,566
What?

267
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:11,844
I don't know. Tell somebody.

268
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:14,096
The newspaper, my father! I mean,

269
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:17,642
you can't just waltz into town and set up
a bomb factory next to people's houses.

270
00:27:17,742 --> 00:27:19,352
It's not a factory.
It's more like a laboratory.

271
00:27:19,452 --> 00:27:21,771
What's the difference? It's nuclear, right?
You have to have hearings.

272
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:23,898
You have to let the community
know about it. There are laws.

273
00:27:23,998 --> 00:27:26,859
It's a government lab. They're not going to
let anybody in there to look around.

274
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,110
- They let you in.
- Fluke.

275
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,820
The guy was horny, so he took a chance.

276
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,448
- So we do nothing? Is that it?
- What do you suggest we do?

277
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:35,993
- March down Washington?
- My parents met at a march on Washington.

278
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:38,596
Really? Very '60s.
Were you born at a Stones concert?

279
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:41,332
This isn't funny.
Do you know what this is like?

280
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:44,418
It's like when you read about Anne Frank
or something and you say to yourself,

281
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:46,128
"Jesus. Why didn't they do something?

282
00:27:46,228 --> 00:27:49,382
"The whole world was collapsing.
They just sat around, life as usual.

283
00:27:49,482 --> 00:27:52,176
"'Maybe it'll go away" '
But it never goes away. It only gets worse.

284
00:27:52,276 --> 00:27:54,074
And nobody thinks about the future.
What's the matter?

285
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:58,015
- Who is Anne Frank?
- A girl in my English class, all right?

286
00:27:58,115 --> 00:27:59,183
What are you looking at?

287
00:27:59,283 --> 00:28:01,581
- The storm. There's a storm coming.
- So?

288
00:28:02,036 --> 00:28:04,730
The lab.
They've got a security system there.

289
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,926
TV cameras, motion detectors, all kinds
of stuff, only the thing is, it's all electric.

290
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:10,677
So?

291
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:13,114
- Lightning. Lightning. Don't you get it?
- No.

292
00:28:13,214 --> 00:28:14,511
We can get in there.

293
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:20,705
Gort? But he's a robot.
Without you, what could he do?

294
00:28:20,805 --> 00:28:23,291
There's no limit to what he could do.

295
00:28:23,391 --> 00:28:24,984
He could destroy the Earth.

296
00:28:27,937 --> 00:28:31,066
If anything should happen to me,
you must go to Gort.

297
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:33,443
You must say these words...

298
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:38,198
Please repeat this.

299
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:46,897
That's very bad for you.

300
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:48,544
Lots of stuff is bad for you.

301
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,840
Would you come here for a minute?

302
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:24,790
- Hello! We're home.
- Jen?

303
00:29:25,786 --> 00:29:27,083
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

304
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:31,275
Hi. It's gonna come down.
Hello, sweetheart.

305
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,694
Hi. This is Paul Stephens
from my science class.

306
00:29:33,794 --> 00:29:36,030
- Hello, Paul.
- Very pleased to meet you both.

307
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,365
Barnaby asleep?

308
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:40,284
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Chocolate-chocolate chip. What do you say?

309
00:29:40,384 --> 00:29:42,933
I was just gonna drive
Paul home, actually.

310
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:45,564
- Okay, okay. Rain check then.
- Sorry.

311
00:29:46,557 --> 00:29:48,751
Drive carefully.
They're predicting some flooding.

312
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:50,068
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

313
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:06,410
There it is. German car, right? Figures.

314
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:55,818
- Incredible.
- What?

315
00:30:55,918 --> 00:31:00,264
Dr. Strangelove. He's in there hitting
on my mother and watching my tapes.

316
00:31:14,436 --> 00:31:15,838
- Paul?
- What?

317
00:31:15,938 --> 00:31:18,487
What if there's more than one guard?

318
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:23,537
No, the whole place is set up
so it can be watched by one person.

319
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:25,181
Look, trust me, it's brilliant.

320
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:26,599
Besides, what can they do to us, anyway?

321
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:29,202
We're kids. It's a prank, right?

322
00:31:54,143 --> 00:31:57,067
Hello? Anybody home?

323
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:01,529
State your name and business, please.

324
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:05,033
- Where are you?
- You're on a remote intercom, ma'am.

325
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:07,540
What seems to be the problem?

326
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:10,100
This isn't Baker North, is if?

327
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,168
No, this is Medatomics Company.

328
00:32:13,454 --> 00:32:16,857
Where's Baker North?
I've been driving around for an hour.

329
00:32:16,957 --> 00:32:19,836
Campus is on the other side
of town, ma'am.

330
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:26,300
What's wrong?

331
00:32:28,052 --> 00:32:30,680
I don't know.
I'm supposed to meet my sister.

332
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:34,896
And I think there's
something wrong with the car.

333
00:32:35,184 --> 00:32:36,561
And...

334
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:39,063
I'm a little scared.

335
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,363
Okay, come on through.

336
00:32:53,243 --> 00:32:54,961
Tell me when.

337
00:32:58,582 --> 00:33:00,459
Okay, get ready.

338
00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:03,800
Now!

339
00:33:26,026 --> 00:33:27,511
Thank you so much.

340
00:33:27,611 --> 00:33:29,888
Your left front tire's flatter
than a pancake.

341
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:33,458
- No. Really?
- Take it easy. We'll get you fixed up.

342
00:33:34,284 --> 00:33:36,645
Some night, huh? You got a spare?

343
00:33:36,745 --> 00:33:38,247
A spare what?

344
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:41,125
A spare tire.

345
00:34:54,865 --> 00:34:58,711
Yes, Information, you got a number
for emergency road service?

346
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:02,498
Yeah, I'll hold.

347
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:07,636
Excuse me, call you back.

348
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:19,644
Hello, Central Office?

349
00:35:20,724 --> 00:35:23,352
Charlie! Ben Bozman over at Medatomics.

350
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:26,213
Is it raining down there?
Well, it is here.

351
00:35:26,313 --> 00:35:29,283
Electric storm.
It's fritzing up the whole system.

352
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:31,785
What? No.

353
00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:34,913
Radiation checkpoints, okay.

354
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:36,807
Look, what can I tell you?

355
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:39,956
There's thunder and lightning.
I keep getting these brownouts.

356
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:41,745
What?

357
00:35:41,912 --> 00:35:45,086
Of course I did!
But they're all just flipping over.

358
00:35:45,249 --> 00:35:47,968
You know these damn things. Every time
you get a power surge, they go crazy.

359
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:50,838
What?

360
00:36:00,055 --> 00:36:03,400
A and B corridor just both went at once,
if you can believe that.

361
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:15,572
I'm gonna do an onsite check and wait
till the storm passes to reset. Okay?

362
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:17,347
Hate to go in there, Charlie.

363
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:20,291
They got stuff in there
that zaps your gonads right off.

364
00:41:40,937 --> 00:41:42,359
- Hi.
- Hi.

365
00:41:43,231 --> 00:41:44,904
What seems to be the trouble?

366
00:43:44,144 --> 00:43:48,320
This jack isn't going to work.
This jack is Mickey Mouse.

367
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:51,760
- Hey, Ben.
- Hi, Terry.

368
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,739
Looks like rain. What do you think?

369
00:43:56,364 --> 00:43:59,351
- What's the matter?
- Damn storm fritzed up the whole system.

370
00:43:59,451 --> 00:44:02,062
- Did you call it in?
- Did I call it in?

371
00:44:02,162 --> 00:44:06,650
Tell you the truth, I'd rather have
one good dog than all that fancy equipment.

372
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,798
Why don't you give me a hand?

373
00:47:28,952 --> 00:47:31,956
- Where's the lug nuts?
- The what?

374
00:47:32,664 --> 00:47:35,087
The things that hold the wheel on.

375
00:47:36,042 --> 00:47:38,136
What do they look like?

376
00:49:54,722 --> 00:49:56,666
Well? Oh, my God!

377
00:49:56,766 --> 00:49:58,668
You were brilliant.
All that crying with the guard.

378
00:49:58,768 --> 00:50:00,611
Thanks. Can we get out of here now?

379
00:50:11,072 --> 00:50:12,824
Genius.

380
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:16,519
That was some sweetie, huh?

381
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:18,354
Come on, now. You're a married man.

382
00:50:18,454 --> 00:50:22,425
Hey, a man can still have
a little snack between meals, can't he?

383
00:50:29,382 --> 00:50:30,975
Good-bye, sweetheart.

384
00:50:54,157 --> 00:50:57,060
All right. First thing tomorrow,
we take it to Dr. Nicci.

385
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,144
- Who?
- Bob Nicci,

386
00:50:58,244 --> 00:51:00,229
a friend of my father's
in the Chemistry Department at Cornell.

387
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:02,523
- He'll verify what it is.
- I told you what it is.

388
00:51:02,623 --> 00:51:04,275
Yeah, but I need
a second source for my article.

389
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:06,277
Like Woodward and Bernstein.

390
00:51:06,377 --> 00:51:07,924
Who's that?

391
00:51:09,338 --> 00:51:11,340
- Article, huh?
- Yeah, why?

392
00:51:12,675 --> 00:51:14,552
I have another thought.

393
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,752
Paul, that's very sick.

394
00:51:22,852 --> 00:51:25,571
I thought you wanted proof. That's proof.

395
00:51:26,856 --> 00:51:29,425
- But we have the stuff. Isn't that enough?
- Enough for what?

396
00:51:29,525 --> 00:51:31,427
An article, an exposé in Rolling Stone.

397
00:51:31,527 --> 00:51:33,888
- I bet they'd publish it...
- Rolling Stone, come on!

398
00:51:33,988 --> 00:51:37,183
Who's gonna care about a couple of kids who
stole some stuff from a lab somewhere?

399
00:51:37,283 --> 00:51:38,476
You want a story?

400
00:51:38,576 --> 00:51:41,125
Write one about a kid
who builds an atomic bomb!

401
00:51:41,829 --> 00:51:43,439
- You realize what you're saying?
- Yes.

402
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:46,109
- You are weird.
- I'm weird? I didn't make that stuff.

403
00:51:46,209 --> 00:51:48,678
- No. It's too dangerous. Isn't it?
- No.

404
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:52,281
It's just a piece of equipment,
like a toaster or a clock.

405
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:53,950
A bunch of parts
that have to be put together.

406
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,451
So you just never put them together.

407
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:58,287
Look, people used to be afraid of cars
because they didn't understand them.

408
00:51:58,387 --> 00:51:59,622
Cars don't kill people.

409
00:51:59,722 --> 00:52:03,438
Cars have killed more people than all
the atomic bombs that were ever made.

410
00:52:05,436 --> 00:52:09,191
- That's not a logical argument.
- I'm not talking about logic.

411
00:52:12,235 --> 00:52:15,430
I'm talking about
the first privately built nuclear device

412
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:17,328
in the history of the world.

413
00:52:31,963 --> 00:52:33,089
Well.

414
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:36,884
Thank you for a very interesting evening.

415
00:52:38,803 --> 00:52:41,622
- Science fair, really?
- 45th Annual Science something.

416
00:52:41,722 --> 00:52:42,790
You get to go to New York.

417
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:45,293
That's the same one
that Roland's entering?

418
00:52:45,393 --> 00:52:49,672
"Retinal deprivation and auditory
enhancement in the common Cricetus."

419
00:52:49,772 --> 00:52:51,174
Zoology!

420
00:52:51,274 --> 00:52:53,176
I'm gonna raise
a generation of hamsters in the dark

421
00:52:53,276 --> 00:52:54,677
and see if it improves their hearing.

422
00:52:54,777 --> 00:52:56,471
That's kind of a weird experiment.

423
00:52:56,571 --> 00:52:59,015
No. The field's wide open.
I think I got a chance to win.

424
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:01,893
Well, then go for it.

425
00:53:01,993 --> 00:53:05,748
Great to see someone turn over a new leaf.

426
00:55:51,787 --> 00:55:53,710
- Hi.
- Hi, Paul.

427
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,034
C-4. High explosives.

428
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,283
Very stable. It's fantastic stuff.

429
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:10,433
Don't be around when it goes off, okay?

430
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:13,958
Say, Paulie, what're you gonna
do with this stuff? No, don't tell me.

431
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:18,190
$60. So, you been down to the garage much?

432
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:19,984
A little. How's the army?

433
00:57:20,084 --> 00:57:23,930
It's a living. Take care, genius.
Don't blow yourself up.

434
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,428
Dr. Wilson, got a minute?

435
00:58:09,592 --> 00:58:11,139
This is Lot 13.

436
00:58:12,178 --> 00:58:13,771
It's completely flat.

437
00:58:14,138 --> 00:58:16,582
- Did you recheck it?
- Yeah, three times.

438
00:58:16,682 --> 00:58:20,002
Run a full-spec analysis.
And keep this between us, okay?

439
00:58:20,102 --> 00:58:21,194
Sure.

440
01:01:00,929 --> 01:01:03,916
Water, citric acid,
sodium laureth sulfate,

441
01:01:04,016 --> 01:01:07,670
hydrolyzed animal protein, glycerin,
U.S. FDA coloring number five.

442
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:08,837
What the hell is it?

443
01:01:08,937 --> 01:01:10,965
- It's shampoo.
- Shampoo?

444
01:01:11,065 --> 01:01:13,133
Yeah, we think either one
of the generic local brands

445
01:01:13,233 --> 01:01:17,179
or maybe something called "Alberto's VO5."

446
01:01:17,279 --> 01:01:18,931
- "Plus glitter."
- Glitter?

447
01:01:19,031 --> 01:01:21,600
Yeah. Shredded aluminum foil
like they use on a greeting card.

448
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,185
Thank you, Howard.

449
01:01:23,285 --> 01:01:25,020
Somebody has a pretty weird
sense of humor.

450
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,274
John, the time-key record
has you in the building

451
01:01:28,374 --> 01:01:30,818
four weeks ago,
Sunday night at 11:08 p.m.,

452
01:01:30,918 --> 01:01:32,861
- out at 11:49.
- No. This is a mistake.

453
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:33,946
- You weren't here?
- No.

454
01:01:34,046 --> 01:01:37,616
- Somebody was with your card.
- That's impossible!

455
01:01:37,716 --> 01:01:40,515
Look, Miles, it's a computer.
They're not infallible.

456
01:01:42,304 --> 01:01:44,581
Wait a minute.

457
01:01:44,681 --> 01:01:46,458
Wasn't that the night
of that big electrical storm?

458
01:01:46,558 --> 01:01:48,310
I don't know. So what?

459
01:01:50,479 --> 01:01:52,152
- Oh, my God.
- What?

460
01:01:53,899 --> 01:01:55,926
Well, here's your answer.

461
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:58,887
There was a power dropout
and you had some garbage in the system.

462
01:01:58,987 --> 01:02:01,807
- It says right here, "Mathewson, 11:08 p.m."
- Yeah, I know.

463
01:02:01,907 --> 01:02:04,184
I know, but do me a favor.
Just check it out. Will you?

464
01:02:04,284 --> 01:02:07,584
I mean, you know these guys.
It's like cabin fever.

465
01:02:08,205 --> 01:02:10,858
It happens all the time.
I'm sure it'll turn up again.

466
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:12,860
- "Cabin fever"?
- Yeah, I mean, when I was at Livermore,

467
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,403
there were two guys who kept mice...

468
01:02:14,503 --> 01:02:16,280
It's a significant amount.
I have to report it.

469
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,657
Come on. They'll be all over us!

470
01:02:18,757 --> 01:02:21,035
Look, I'm on a crash program here.

471
01:02:21,135 --> 01:02:22,494
You wanna bring everything to a dead stop

472
01:02:22,594 --> 01:02:24,288
- just because you got a little glitch?
- I'm sorry, John.

473
01:02:24,388 --> 01:02:26,061
I don't make the rules!

474
01:03:24,656 --> 01:03:25,657
Hello?

475
01:03:25,949 --> 01:03:27,518
- Hi.
- Hi!

476
01:03:27,618 --> 01:03:29,746
Listen, can I talk to Paul?

477
01:03:29,912 --> 01:03:33,524
- Paul's away until tomorrow night.
- Where?

478
01:03:33,624 --> 01:03:36,878
New York. He has a project
in the science fair. He didn't tell you?

479
01:03:37,294 --> 01:03:39,467
No. What kind of project?

480
01:03:39,922 --> 01:03:44,018
Something at school. Guinea pigs.
No, hamsters. Why? What's up?

481
01:03:45,093 --> 01:03:49,974
It's nothing.
I just had some tickets to the ballgame.

482
01:03:50,641 --> 01:03:51,750
Oh, gosh!

483
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:52,851
What?

484
01:03:53,268 --> 01:03:55,521
They need me on the floor.

485
01:03:56,021 --> 01:03:58,991
Listen. What hotel is he at?

486
01:03:59,775 --> 01:04:01,218
The New York Penta.

487
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:03,286
Penta, great. I'll give him a ring, okay?

488
01:04:04,029 --> 01:04:05,121
Okay.

489
01:04:05,614 --> 01:04:08,618
Great, well.
Listen, I'd better go, bye-bye.

490
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:10,957
Bye.

491
01:04:26,468 --> 01:04:29,371
You're saying you never actually went inside
and saw what he was doing?

492
01:04:29,471 --> 01:04:30,664
- No.
- Why not?

493
01:04:30,764 --> 01:04:32,437
He never asked me.

494
01:04:33,141 --> 01:04:37,396
What's the problem? Was he sexually
abusing the hamsters or something?

495
01:05:18,812 --> 01:05:21,691
You're in section 96.
That's in the balcony.

496
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:26,970
The judges are circulating now,
and the final eliminations start at 3:00.

497
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:30,540
- Do you have accommodations?
- I'm a guest in the hotel.

498
01:05:30,866 --> 01:05:32,267
- What is that?
- Key to the room.

499
01:05:32,367 --> 01:05:34,165
Very scientific.

500
01:05:46,214 --> 01:05:47,950
Hey, Roland, what do you say?

501
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:51,328
Stephens, keep away.
Just keep away from me.

502
01:05:51,428 --> 01:05:53,580
- Good luck, Roland.
- Yeah, sure.

503
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,182
Keep in touch.

504
01:06:03,023 --> 01:06:05,467
Effectively, what my project deals
with is Halley's Comet,

505
01:06:05,567 --> 01:06:08,470
and tracking Halley's Comet
for the duration it'll be here.

506
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:11,540
Halley's Comet will be most
visible in the southern hemisphere.

507
01:06:13,116 --> 01:06:15,143
What are you doing after the fair?

508
01:06:15,243 --> 01:06:17,416
- Tonight?
- Yeah, tonight.

509
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:25,387
Electrodes discharge
which makes impact with the atom.

510
01:06:26,171 --> 01:06:28,299
- What number are we?
- Ninety-six.

511
01:06:28,924 --> 01:06:29,925
There we are.

512
01:06:31,093 --> 01:06:32,766
Wow, look at her.

513
01:06:33,387 --> 01:06:36,999
Okay, so, we set it up
and right before the elimination,

514
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:40,252
we go downstairs to the car,
we bring it up here,

515
01:06:40,352 --> 01:06:45,399
we unveil it, we win first prize,
we get to go on television.

516
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:49,286
- Am I leaving anything out?
- Just the part where we get shot for treason.

517
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:54,182
I'd like to try Italian. You want Italian?

518
01:06:54,282 --> 01:06:55,976
Yeah, yeah. It's great.

519
01:06:56,076 --> 01:06:58,795
- Maybe we could go tonight?
- Okay, sure.

520
01:06:59,663 --> 01:07:01,165
It's downtown.

521
01:07:07,045 --> 01:07:09,548
- Hi.
- Hi.

522
01:07:09,798 --> 01:07:11,596
Where's your badge?
You gotta have a badge.

523
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:15,099
Jenny.

524
01:07:16,346 --> 01:07:18,373
- Jeffrey. Hi.
- Hi.

525
01:07:18,473 --> 01:07:19,474
What is that?

526
01:07:19,975 --> 01:07:21,877
Nothing special. Just some microwaves.

527
01:07:21,977 --> 01:07:25,314
I invented a way of using insects
as a dietary supplement for humans.

528
01:07:25,772 --> 01:07:27,365
Beetles, ants, mosquitoes.

529
01:07:27,482 --> 01:07:28,508
You grind them up.

530
01:07:28,608 --> 01:07:30,736
- Low cholesterol and...
- Shut up, Eccles. That's disgusting.

531
01:07:31,987 --> 01:07:33,705
My project is quite fascinating.

532
01:07:33,822 --> 01:07:37,125
I took six common toads and froze them
in liquid nitrogen for six months.

533
01:07:37,826 --> 01:07:39,920
- Why?
- Wouldn't you like to know!

534
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:43,899
My project is a study of
social behavior in elevators.

535
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,502
How people react under pressure.

536
01:07:47,544 --> 01:07:50,718
Her eyes moved away! Don't you like me?
She doesn't like me!

537
01:07:51,089 --> 01:07:54,034
You'll have to excuse him.
He's got a hormone imbalance.

538
01:07:54,134 --> 01:07:56,557
- What's your project?
- Nothing. Just some hamsters.

539
01:07:56,845 --> 01:07:59,849
- He's lying. He blinked.
- They're all afraid of the competition.

540
01:08:00,348 --> 01:08:03,652
What's the difference? It's not if you win,
it's how you play the game, right?

541
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:05,771
No. It's if you win.

542
01:08:13,487 --> 01:08:16,431
Dr. Mathewson, Lieutenant Colonel
Conroy, Defense Nuclear Agency.

543
01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:19,017
- Hi, how are you?
- I've been better.

544
01:08:19,117 --> 01:08:21,895
So, somebody took your magic beans
and built himself a firecracker.

545
01:08:21,995 --> 01:08:23,313
- Is that it?
- That's it.

546
01:08:23,413 --> 01:08:24,731
How big a bang are we talking about?

547
01:08:24,831 --> 01:08:26,692
Fifty kilotons, give or take.

548
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:30,904
Doctor, unless I'm mistaken, 50 kilotons
could just about evaporate a small city.

549
01:08:31,004 --> 01:08:32,698
- That's right.
- Good Christ!

550
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:34,199
And the kid put this thing together?

551
01:08:34,299 --> 01:08:35,909
Yeah, kind of makes you think, doesn't it?

552
01:08:36,009 --> 01:08:37,119
Any idea who he's working with?

553
01:08:37,219 --> 01:08:39,496
I don't think he's working with anybody.
I think he did it by himself.

554
01:08:39,596 --> 01:08:41,039
- What for?
- I don't know.

555
01:08:41,139 --> 01:08:43,333
- Maybe to see if he could do it.
- Crazy!

556
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:45,060
It's a crazy world.

557
01:08:49,231 --> 01:08:50,904
Okay, how's this?

558
01:08:51,566 --> 01:08:54,136
"Paul Stephens, a high school
student from Ithaca, New York,

559
01:08:54,236 --> 01:08:58,181
"unveiled a homemade atomic bomb
at the 45th Annual Science Fair today,

560
01:08:58,281 --> 01:09:01,309
"thereby becoming the first private
citizen to join the nuclear club,

561
01:09:01,409 --> 01:09:04,062
"an exclusive group whose other
members include the United States,

562
01:09:04,162 --> 01:09:06,440
"the Soviet Union,
Great Britain, France and China."

563
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,859
If I'm in the nuclear club,
do I get a jacket?

564
01:09:08,959 --> 01:09:11,007
You get anything you want.

565
01:09:16,258 --> 01:09:17,976
- Jenny.
- What?

566
01:09:19,427 --> 01:09:21,163
I never thought I'd say this to anybody,

567
01:09:21,263 --> 01:09:25,188
but I've gotta go get
the atomic bomb out of the car.

568
01:09:25,976 --> 01:09:27,273
Oh, yeah?

569
01:09:40,949 --> 01:09:42,184
Hi, Dr. Mathewson.

570
01:09:42,284 --> 01:09:44,102
- Is this him?
- Paul, what do you think you're doing?

571
01:09:44,202 --> 01:09:45,729
Well, I thought we might start
with some kissing

572
01:09:45,829 --> 01:09:47,939
- and then move into the fancy stuff.
- Cute, real cute.

573
01:09:48,039 --> 01:09:49,816
Normal background radiation.
I don't think it's here.

574
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:51,151
Wow, what is that?

575
01:09:51,251 --> 01:09:53,737
- Neutron detector.
- Really? Who makes those?

576
01:09:53,837 --> 01:09:56,198
- Don't try my patience, boy!
- Come on, Paul.

577
01:09:56,298 --> 01:09:58,950
Get the stuff near the typewriter.
What's that over there?

578
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:01,286
- Excuse me, this is a private room.
- Who are you?

579
01:10:01,386 --> 01:10:03,330
My name is Jennifer Anderman.
My father's a lawyer.

580
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:04,456
Good. You're gonna need him.

581
01:10:04,556 --> 01:10:05,957
You can't come in here without a warrant.

582
01:10:06,057 --> 01:10:07,584
- It's unconstitutional.
- Yeah, what is this, Russia?

583
01:10:07,684 --> 01:10:10,003
You have exactly 10 seconds
to come up with that damn thing.

584
01:10:10,103 --> 01:10:11,671
I demand to make a phone call.

585
01:10:11,771 --> 01:10:13,865
They can't do this, Paul.
It's illegal search and seizure.

586
01:10:13,982 --> 01:10:15,383
Would you please escort
this young lady outside?

587
01:10:15,483 --> 01:10:18,053
Don't you touch me!
I want to know the charges!

588
01:10:18,153 --> 01:10:20,555
- Yeah!
- The charges? Okay.

589
01:10:20,655 --> 01:10:23,225
How about theft of government property,
transportation of stolen goods,

590
01:10:23,325 --> 01:10:26,061
reckless endangerment,
violation of the Nuclear Regulatory Act

591
01:10:26,161 --> 01:10:27,562
and conspiracy to commit espionage.

592
01:10:27,662 --> 01:10:28,980
Is that good enough for starters?

593
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,900
You're in a pack of trouble, son!
You're not as smart as you think!

594
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,799
Look, Colonel, we're not
going to accomplish anything like this.

595
01:10:35,045 --> 01:10:37,197
When I want your expert advice,
Doctor, I'll ask for it.

596
01:10:37,297 --> 01:10:39,574
- We demand to see a lawyer.
- You'll see a lawyer when I say so!

597
01:10:39,674 --> 01:10:41,701
Listen, I gave you an order.
This isn't a goddamn debate!

598
01:10:41,801 --> 01:10:44,704
- If you'll just please...
- Get your hands off me! No!

599
01:10:44,804 --> 01:10:46,414
- Get your hands off me!
- Okay, okay.

600
01:10:46,514 --> 01:10:49,063
I'm making a phone call!
Hey, don't you touch me!

601
01:10:50,477 --> 01:10:52,104
Everybody, quiet!

602
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:54,773
Let's all just get a little grip.

603
01:10:55,774 --> 01:10:57,822
Now, we did kind of burst in here.

604
01:10:59,152 --> 01:11:03,702
Look, Colonel, what do you say me
and Paul, we take a little walk?

605
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,992
Just the two of us.

606
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:10,540
I'm sure we can work this whole thing out.
What do you say, Paul?

607
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:12,256
Colonel?

608
01:11:13,249 --> 01:11:15,627
- You have five minutes.
- Thanks.

609
01:11:24,094 --> 01:11:26,413
- Kind of upset in there, huh?
- I don't know why.

610
01:11:26,513 --> 01:11:29,207
- It's just some lubricating oil for the robot.
- What do you want us to do,

611
01:11:29,307 --> 01:11:33,232
put up a neon sign saying,
"Secret Weapons Laboratory"?

612
01:11:33,937 --> 01:11:36,840
I wish the world were
a simpler place, Paul, but it's not.

613
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,509
Don't worry about it.
They can't do anything to me.

614
01:11:39,609 --> 01:11:41,469
- Why not?
- I'm underage.

615
01:11:41,569 --> 01:11:45,140
That's really brilliant.
What do you think this is, the school play?

616
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,059
They don't care how old you are,
or how cute. They're gorillas.

617
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:49,752
They can hurt you. Don't you get it?

618
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:51,771
If you try to tough it out with them,

619
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:54,249
they'll lock you in a room somewhere
and throw away the room!

620
01:11:55,041 --> 01:11:56,318
It's really that important to you, huh?

621
01:11:56,418 --> 01:11:58,637
It's not just me, Paul.

622
01:11:59,587 --> 01:12:01,089
To everybody.

623
01:12:02,048 --> 01:12:03,550
Now, what do you say?

624
01:12:07,387 --> 01:12:08,479
Okay.

625
01:12:09,597 --> 01:12:12,876
- That's better. Where is it?
- No, no. Not now.

626
01:12:12,976 --> 01:12:14,669
What do you mean, "Not now"? When?

627
01:12:14,769 --> 01:12:16,755
- After the fair.
- Come on, Paul.

628
01:12:16,855 --> 01:12:18,840
But it's gotta be judged.
I'm gonna win first prize.

629
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:19,966
You're joking.

630
01:12:20,066 --> 01:12:21,801
No. Did you see the junk
they got down there?

631
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:23,448
Paul, forget the science fair.

632
01:12:24,237 --> 01:12:26,831
It's over, okay? No more science fair.

633
01:12:27,615 --> 01:12:30,960
Look, this is top-secret stuff.
Nobody sees this.

634
01:12:31,453 --> 01:12:34,047
Not ever. You could start a war.

635
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:37,588
Stop screwing around before it's too late.

636
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:46,976
Paul, for God's sake.

637
01:12:47,469 --> 01:12:49,312
It was here. I swear.

638
01:12:50,138 --> 01:12:51,206
Jenny must have taken it.

639
01:12:51,306 --> 01:12:52,540
The girl hasn't been out of our sight.

640
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,001
Then somebody must have stolen it. Jesus.

641
01:12:55,101 --> 01:12:56,728
All right, son.
Would you come with us now, please?

642
01:12:57,645 --> 01:12:59,647
- Just a minute.
- We'll take it from here.

643
01:13:00,273 --> 01:13:01,633
He's telling the truth!

644
01:13:01,733 --> 01:13:03,718
Okay, fine. He has nothing to worry about.

645
01:13:03,818 --> 01:13:06,367
It was in a box, a toolbox!

646
01:13:06,696 --> 01:13:09,791
My dad gave it to me right before he left.

647
01:13:26,925 --> 01:13:28,768
We really have to know where it is.

648
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,637
I've already told you, I don't know.

649
01:13:32,013 --> 01:13:33,890
Look, guys. I've got to go now.

650
01:13:40,897 --> 01:13:43,571
Come on, guys. What is that?

651
01:13:44,025 --> 01:13:46,244
Just to relax you and help you remember.

652
01:13:47,362 --> 01:13:49,514
But I already told you.
I put it in the trunk. I swear.

653
01:13:49,614 --> 01:13:51,433
But it wasn't in the trunk, was it?

654
01:13:51,533 --> 01:13:52,767
Just relax.

655
01:13:52,867 --> 01:13:54,710
Okay! Okay!

656
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:56,371
Okay!

657
01:13:57,038 --> 01:13:59,211
- You want the truth.
- That would be nice.

658
01:14:00,792 --> 01:14:03,611
The truth is you guys are a bunch
of assholes. When I get out...

659
01:14:03,711 --> 01:14:06,214
You're very hostile, Paul.
Just hold him, I can do it through his shirt.

660
01:14:10,718 --> 01:14:11,765
What the hell?

661
01:14:20,979 --> 01:14:22,777
Hey, you.

662
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,136
Is that thing really a nuclear device?

663
01:14:28,236 --> 01:14:29,738
Far out.

664
01:14:30,488 --> 01:14:33,391
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

665
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:36,916
Your attention, please, ladies and
gentleman. It gives me great pleasure...

666
01:15:00,435 --> 01:15:02,670
Night vision. Army surplus.

667
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,506
- The lights are on.
- What?

668
01:15:04,606 --> 01:15:06,382
- You took it? How?
- Simple.

669
01:15:06,482 --> 01:15:08,885
Hotel computer. Got your girlfriend's name,
Jenny Anderman.

670
01:15:08,985 --> 01:15:12,239
Accessed the Department of Motor Vehicles
for the make and license on the car.

671
01:15:15,658 --> 01:15:17,811
Paul, what's wrong?

672
01:15:17,911 --> 01:15:19,687
- They gave him an injection.
- Probably sodium amytal.

673
01:15:19,787 --> 01:15:21,064
Do you have a bitter taste in your mouth?

674
01:15:21,164 --> 01:15:22,857
Just keep him moving. He'll be okay.

675
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:24,359
- Have you got enough money?
- What for?

676
01:15:24,459 --> 01:15:26,653
To get away.
This place is crawling with Feds.

677
01:15:26,753 --> 01:15:27,904
I have a credit card.

678
01:15:28,004 --> 01:15:29,927
No, cash. Come on, money, money!

679
01:15:30,882 --> 01:15:32,951
- You owe me $80.
- What's wrong?

680
01:15:33,051 --> 01:15:34,803
You guys are beautiful guys.

681
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:37,580
- Send me a letter.
- Why are you doing this?

682
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,166
Because life is more than freezing toads.

683
01:15:40,266 --> 01:15:42,860
I got a taxi! The coast is clear, come on.

684
01:15:43,353 --> 01:15:44,479
Come on.

685
01:15:58,826 --> 01:16:00,728
Hi, folks, where to today?

686
01:16:00,828 --> 01:16:02,105
Ithaca.

687
01:16:02,205 --> 01:16:03,231
Funny kid.

688
01:16:03,331 --> 01:16:04,399
- Ithaca?
- Plan.

689
01:16:04,499 --> 01:16:07,485
I bet you can't guess what's in this box.

690
01:16:07,585 --> 01:16:09,112
- A human head?
- Wrong.

691
01:16:09,212 --> 01:16:11,322
An atomic bomb. Do you want to see?

692
01:16:11,422 --> 01:16:12,532
Not really.

693
01:16:12,632 --> 01:16:15,932
Driver, if you only had $87 and you had
to get to Ithaca, what would you do?

694
01:16:34,988 --> 01:16:36,114
Come on.

695
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:39,325
Come on.

696
01:16:41,494 --> 01:16:42,746
Safe.

697
01:16:43,579 --> 01:16:44,796
You saved us.

698
01:16:45,415 --> 01:16:46,837
Great.

699
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:48,209
Jenny.

700
01:16:48,876 --> 01:16:50,278
I love you, Jenny.

701
01:16:50,378 --> 01:16:51,925
I want to be your wife.

702
01:18:12,794 --> 01:18:14,296
Excuse me, can I help you?

703
01:18:20,259 --> 01:18:21,911
- Mrs. Elizabeth Stephens?
- Yes.

704
01:18:22,011 --> 01:18:24,872
Lieutenant Colonel Conroy,
U.S. Army Delta Force.

705
01:18:24,972 --> 01:18:27,041
These men are with
the Nuclear Emergency Search Team,

706
01:18:27,141 --> 01:18:28,751
a duly authorized government agency.

707
01:18:28,851 --> 01:18:32,196
I'm taking over these
premises as a temporary crisis center.

708
01:18:33,481 --> 01:18:35,591
Nuclear Emergency, what? What's happening?

709
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:37,635
- It's Paul. Something happened.
- Paul?

710
01:18:37,735 --> 01:18:39,328
He's all right, I think.

711
01:18:57,296 --> 01:19:01,409
"Paul Jacob Stephens. Born Ithaca,
New York, February 14th, 1970.

712
01:19:01,509 --> 01:19:05,747
"Mother, Elizabeth Adams Stephens,
admitted maternity ward 6:20 p.m.

713
01:19:05,847 --> 01:19:08,207
"Given 25 milligrams Demerol."

714
01:19:08,307 --> 01:19:10,025
Good work. That'll be real useful.

715
01:19:10,435 --> 01:19:12,587
We have a recent photograph
of your family.

716
01:19:12,687 --> 01:19:15,548
You and your husband were
separated six months ago? Is that right?

717
01:19:15,648 --> 01:19:17,884
Yes, would you mind
not bending the picture?

718
01:19:17,984 --> 01:19:21,864
Has your son had nightmares,
anxiety or spells of depression?

719
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:24,265
You mean, is he normal?

720
01:19:24,365 --> 01:19:26,476
Does he eat an excessive amount of sweets?

721
01:19:26,576 --> 01:19:27,560
What?

722
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:31,039
He got seven new cavities
this year and only one the prior year.

723
01:19:31,456 --> 01:19:34,209
Hypoglycemic mood swings, paranoia.

724
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:35,960
Does he feel that people don't like him?

725
01:19:36,294 --> 01:19:37,671
That he's special? Or different?

726
01:19:38,004 --> 01:19:39,881
Is he unhappy with
the present political system?

727
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:43,013
Seven cavities? Are you sure?

728
01:20:19,837 --> 01:20:23,783
State and federal authorities
are looking for him and a female companion

729
01:20:23,883 --> 01:20:27,183
in connection with what appears
to be a nuclear burglary case.

730
01:20:27,637 --> 01:20:31,332
Official sources say that
what seemed to be an innocent prank

731
01:20:31,432 --> 01:20:35,002
may turn out to compromise
the American defense posture

732
01:20:35,102 --> 01:20:38,840
with overtones of espionage
and international terrorism.

733
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:41,092
Barbara Collins has more in New York.

734
01:20:41,192 --> 01:20:44,162
Stephens? Very disturbed person.
Definitely the criminal type.

735
01:22:13,993 --> 01:22:15,937
- Paul.
- What?

736
01:22:16,037 --> 01:22:19,232
- Let's just give it back.
- Not yet. Tomorrow.

737
01:22:19,332 --> 01:22:21,585
- What're you going to do?
- Get you your article.

738
01:22:22,668 --> 01:22:25,613
I don't know. It's getting pretty weird.

739
01:22:25,713 --> 01:22:27,615
Don't give up now. Now when we got them.

740
01:22:27,715 --> 01:22:29,388
- We got them?
- Sure.

741
01:22:29,884 --> 01:22:31,852
Come on, if it was easy, it'd be easy.

742
01:22:32,303 --> 01:22:34,476
What about nobody doing anything?
Remember?

743
01:22:35,014 --> 01:22:37,016
What about the future?
What about all that?

744
01:22:37,433 --> 01:22:39,627
If we get killed, we have no future.

745
01:22:39,727 --> 01:22:41,980
Of course we will.
We always have a future.

746
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:50,071
Hey.

747
01:22:51,405 --> 01:22:52,406
Apple?

748
01:23:08,214 --> 01:23:11,434
Come on, let's get some sleep.

749
01:23:29,735 --> 01:23:34,015
It'd be easier if you accepted that he
wasn't an innocent victim in all this.

750
01:23:34,115 --> 01:23:36,976
Yes, I know, he's the criminal.
That makes it all so simple.

751
01:23:37,076 --> 01:23:39,295
He did do some things
that are against the law.

752
01:23:39,745 --> 01:23:42,294
- Maybe there's a higher law.
- What?

753
01:23:42,456 --> 01:23:43,924
A higher law.

754
01:23:44,542 --> 01:23:47,820
What're you saying? He did it for ethics?
For reasons of conscience?

755
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,281
Who do you think he is, Galileo?
He's a kid.

756
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:52,554
Kids don't have reasons.
They just do things.

757
01:23:52,758 --> 01:23:55,828
- What do you know about children?
- I used to be one.

758
01:23:55,928 --> 01:23:58,477
- You don't know him.
- But I do.

759
01:23:59,056 --> 01:24:02,481
He's got a gift and he wants
to use it, that's all.

760
01:24:03,185 --> 01:24:05,438
It's as natural as breathing.

761
01:24:05,813 --> 01:24:08,487
Don't make him into
some kind of an activist.

762
01:24:10,651 --> 01:24:11,844
What?

763
01:24:11,944 --> 01:24:14,430
Who are these people?
They are in my house.

764
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:17,704
What gives them the right?
They know about everything.

765
01:24:18,325 --> 01:24:19,497
They know about his teeth!

766
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:22,396
Look. It's 6.00 a.m. You're exhausted.

767
01:24:22,496 --> 01:24:24,840
Why don't you do something,
for God's sake?

768
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:27,418
- What do you suggest?
- I don't know.

769
01:24:28,002 --> 01:24:30,050
Blow them up. That's your field, isn't it?

770
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:39,347
He's a very resourceful kid.
He's going to be okay.

771
01:24:41,056 --> 01:24:45,044
I hope so. Because if anything
happens to him, anything...

772
01:24:45,144 --> 01:24:48,239
If one hair on his head is harmed,

773
01:24:50,065 --> 01:24:52,989
I promise you,
I'm going to find all of you people

774
01:24:53,819 --> 01:24:56,572
and I'm going to make
your lives absolutely miserable.

775
01:25:26,894 --> 01:25:30,398
Hello. Who? Yes, I'll accept. Hello, Paul.

776
01:25:30,898 --> 01:25:32,150
Hi, Mom, don't get crazy.

777
01:25:32,525 --> 01:25:35,010
Paul, what's going on?
They're saying all kinds of things.

778
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:36,804
Paul, did you build an atomic bomb?

779
01:25:36,904 --> 01:25:38,406
- Only a little one.
- Oh, my God!

780
01:25:38,656 --> 01:25:41,559
Look, I'm okay. I don't have much time.
I need to get a message to John.

781
01:25:41,659 --> 01:25:43,352
- If he calls.
- I'm here, Paul.

782
01:25:43,452 --> 01:25:44,999
- What?
- It's me. It's John.

783
01:25:45,955 --> 01:25:47,815
- You're there in the house?
- Yeah.

784
01:25:47,915 --> 01:25:49,650
- They're all here, Paul.
- Who all?

785
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:52,194
Lots of government men. The army.
It's like an invasion.

786
01:25:52,294 --> 01:25:53,988
- Jesus, are you okay?
- Yes.

787
01:25:54,088 --> 01:25:55,156
Are you going to give them the bomb?

788
01:25:55,256 --> 01:25:56,741
Yes, but I want something in return.

789
01:25:56,841 --> 01:25:58,242
I want a statement.

790
01:25:58,342 --> 01:26:00,094
- What kind of a statement?
- From you.

791
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:01,871
Signed by you about the lab.

792
01:26:01,971 --> 01:26:04,440
What it is, where it is,
what happens inside, everything.

793
01:26:04,765 --> 01:26:06,834
- What for?
- I just want it.

794
01:26:06,934 --> 01:26:09,437
I can't do that. I've signed
a security clearance. I'll go to jail.

795
01:26:09,645 --> 01:26:10,671
You'll go to jail.

796
01:26:10,771 --> 01:26:13,382
Look, that's the deal.
The gadget for the statement.

797
01:26:13,482 --> 01:26:14,859
Now, come on, I don't have much time.

798
01:26:22,616 --> 01:26:24,435
Okay, what do I do, type something up?

799
01:26:24,535 --> 01:26:26,520
- That'll do for starters.
- Starters?

800
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:29,169
Just meet me at the lab in one hour.
Main gate.

801
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:32,568
- Why the lab?
- Because that's what I want.

802
01:26:32,668 --> 01:26:35,763
And make sure that we can get inside.
I want photographs, too.

803
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:39,366
- Photographs? Come on, Paul!
- Yeah, lots of photographs.

804
01:26:39,466 --> 01:26:41,577
Tell your pals, no funny stuff.

805
01:26:41,677 --> 01:26:43,645
I'm very tense.
There's no telling what I might do.

806
01:26:44,054 --> 01:26:45,915
- Paul.
- Take it easy. You're fine.

807
01:26:46,015 --> 01:26:48,417
No, I'm a terrorist.
Haven't you been watching television?

808
01:26:48,517 --> 01:26:50,002
Paul, what are you talking about?

809
01:26:50,102 --> 01:26:51,900
- Paul.
- Paul.

810
01:27:03,782 --> 01:27:05,784
Look, he trusts me. Let me do it.

811
01:27:06,285 --> 01:27:07,770
I'll get it back. That's what we want.

812
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:09,396
How do we know this thing won't be armed?

813
01:27:09,496 --> 01:27:12,375
That's right. He used the phrase,
"I'm a terrorist." Here.

814
01:27:13,751 --> 01:27:15,820
"No, I'm a terrorist.
Haven't you been watching television?"

815
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,780
You people really live
in your own world, don't you?

816
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,180
Well, we don't have
the luxury of living in yours.

817
01:28:05,219 --> 01:28:07,413
Are you sure you want to do this?

818
01:28:07,513 --> 01:28:08,789
Yes.

819
01:28:08,889 --> 01:28:11,083
Look, it'll take me about
five minutes to make it to the main gate.

820
01:28:11,183 --> 01:28:14,086
- You know what to do?
- Drive to the bait shop and make a call.

821
01:28:14,186 --> 01:28:16,689
- You got change?
- Yeah. I'll do it. Don't worry.

822
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,028
- What else?
- Don't forget to focus.

823
01:28:23,529 --> 01:28:24,781
Piece of cake.

824
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:56,775
This is Unit 1.
The package has arrived, and it's hot.

825
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,713
- Hi.
- Hi.

826
01:29:19,334 --> 01:29:20,631
Is that it?

827
01:29:22,129 --> 01:29:23,472
What is that, a cat box?

828
01:29:24,048 --> 01:29:25,470
You got the statement?

829
01:29:30,596 --> 01:29:32,439
Could you open it
and hand it to me, please?

830
01:29:42,816 --> 01:29:44,113
What's DOE?

831
01:29:44,276 --> 01:29:45,402
Department of Energy.

832
01:29:45,819 --> 01:29:47,366
- They're the guys who...
- Yeah.

833
01:29:49,531 --> 01:29:50,532
Okay.

834
01:29:51,283 --> 01:29:52,284
Let's go.

835
01:29:54,161 --> 01:29:56,755
- You really want to go inside the building?
- Yeah.

836
01:29:57,998 --> 01:29:59,170
Paul, it's dangerous.

837
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:01,673
That's what makes it so exciting.

838
01:30:04,171 --> 01:30:05,297
Of course.

839
01:30:15,015 --> 01:30:16,016
So, Paul.

840
01:30:16,809 --> 01:30:18,652
Why the big push for publicity?

841
01:30:19,019 --> 01:30:22,172
Well, I was thinking, this is such a neat
place. People ought to know about it.

842
01:30:22,272 --> 01:30:23,257
- What?
- No, really.

843
01:30:23,357 --> 01:30:26,427
They got lots of cool equipment,
robots, plutonium.

844
01:30:26,527 --> 01:30:29,096
Why keep it a secret?
They should have tours, like Disneyland.

845
01:30:29,196 --> 01:30:30,723
Paul, you may be having fun right now...

846
01:30:30,823 --> 01:30:32,040
I'm not having any fun!

847
01:30:33,617 --> 01:30:36,587
I'm scared out of my mind.
But I don't have any choice.

848
01:30:37,246 --> 01:30:39,982
- Of course you do. Just give me the box.
- Yeah. Great.

849
01:30:40,082 --> 01:30:41,066
Why not?

850
01:30:41,166 --> 01:30:43,152
Are you kidding?
You think they're going to let me go home,

851
01:30:43,252 --> 01:30:45,029
knowing what I know about this place?

852
01:30:45,129 --> 01:30:47,281
Jesus. You're more naive than I thought.

853
01:30:47,381 --> 01:30:48,949
So, what do you think
they are going to do?

854
01:30:49,049 --> 01:30:50,451
I think they're going to try and kill me.

855
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:51,768
Why?

856
01:30:52,511 --> 01:30:54,455
That's what I'd do if I was them.

857
01:30:54,555 --> 01:30:56,540
- That's purely hypothetical.
- No, it's perfectly logical.

858
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,734
I'm the leak, so plug the leak.

859
01:30:59,226 --> 01:31:02,275
- What are you going to do?
- Don't worry. I'm working on it.

860
01:31:21,915 --> 01:31:23,525
- Hello.
- Max, thank God.

861
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:24,610
- Jenny.
- Yeah.

862
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:26,361
Jesus! What is going on?
You guys have been on the news.

863
01:31:26,461 --> 01:31:28,589
And someone said there's
a helicopter at Paul's house!

864
01:31:28,881 --> 01:31:30,824
Listen, Max, you got to do
two things for us, okay?

865
01:31:30,924 --> 01:31:32,576
It's a matter of life and death.

866
01:31:32,676 --> 01:31:34,553
- Yeah, sure. Whose?
- Everybody's.

867
01:31:35,137 --> 01:31:37,790
First, call my parents,
and then call two people.

868
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:40,518
I don't care who.
Have them call two people.

869
01:31:40,767 --> 01:31:43,295
And call the newspaper and the TV station.
Are you listening?

870
01:31:43,395 --> 01:31:44,338
Yeah, go ahead.

871
01:31:44,438 --> 01:31:46,941
Okay, there's a place called
Medatomics on Route 81.

872
01:32:12,299 --> 01:32:14,973
This is Position 2.
They're approaching the detector.

873
01:32:16,345 --> 01:32:18,018
Okay, Position 2. We copy.

874
01:32:32,486 --> 01:32:33,720
He's got it all right.

875
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:38,976
There's the core, explosive package,
electronics, tamper, batteries.

876
01:32:39,076 --> 01:32:40,185
Nice design, actually.

877
01:32:40,285 --> 01:32:41,270
- Is it armed?
- No.

878
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:42,604
You're certain?

879
01:32:42,704 --> 01:32:44,001
It's all in sections.

880
01:32:45,666 --> 01:32:46,918
Paul.

881
01:32:48,627 --> 01:32:50,529
We know it's not armed, Paul.

882
01:32:50,629 --> 01:32:53,178
So, why don't you just
put it down and walk away?

883
01:32:54,007 --> 01:32:54,992
Walk away?

884
01:32:55,092 --> 01:32:58,078
That's right.
I am going to count to three.

885
01:32:58,178 --> 01:32:59,913
- Hey, let me talk to him.
- Doctor, stay out of this.

886
01:33:00,013 --> 01:33:01,748
Let me talk to Conroy on that thing.

887
01:33:01,848 --> 01:33:03,917
- This wasn't part of the deal.
- One, two...

888
01:33:04,017 --> 01:33:05,419
- Don't hit the box!
- Jesus.

889
01:33:05,519 --> 01:33:07,588
- He's got plutonium in that, for God's sake.
- Shit!

890
01:33:07,688 --> 01:33:08,735
Paul!

891
01:33:14,152 --> 01:33:15,429
Keep your hands on the wall, Doctor.

892
01:33:15,529 --> 01:33:18,282
You breathe funny
and I'll blow your fucking brains out.

893
01:34:05,954 --> 01:34:07,080
Oh, Jesus.

894
01:34:07,956 --> 01:34:08,957
What?

895
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:11,088
He's really putting it together.

896
01:34:11,585 --> 01:34:13,028
Give me a status report.

897
01:34:13,128 --> 01:34:15,176
Two, three and four, what you got?

898
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:18,450
There's no way I can get him
without hitting the green stuff

899
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:19,767
or going through the Plexi.

900
01:34:20,427 --> 01:34:21,453
Me neither.

901
01:34:21,553 --> 01:34:22,554
Same here.

902
01:35:04,346 --> 01:35:05,347
Oh, boy.

903
01:36:34,311 --> 01:36:35,712
Okay, here's the deal.

904
01:36:35,812 --> 01:36:38,465
We have an irrational child
down there with an armed device.

905
01:36:38,565 --> 01:36:40,300
He seems to trust you,
so you get down there.

906
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:41,593
And do what?

907
01:36:41,693 --> 01:36:44,071
- Disarm him and get him to take it apart.
- And if he won't?

908
01:36:44,404 --> 01:36:46,406
Then just separate him from it.
We'll do the rest.

909
01:36:49,951 --> 01:36:51,919
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

910
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:54,832
Because I'm not a...

911
01:36:55,081 --> 01:36:57,300
Killer? Is that the word
you're groping for, Doctor?

912
01:36:57,417 --> 01:36:59,986
What the bloody hell do you think
you've been working on all these years?

913
01:37:00,086 --> 01:37:01,338
What do you think all this is for?

914
01:37:01,755 --> 01:37:03,490
Your own personal amusement?

915
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:05,592
To stimulate you intellectually?

916
01:37:06,468 --> 01:37:09,496
You are what you are, Doctor,
a son of a bitch, like the rest of us.

917
01:37:09,596 --> 01:37:13,066
Now for God's sake, take some
responsibility and do what has to be done.

918
01:37:35,747 --> 01:37:37,044
Hello, again.

919
01:37:39,084 --> 01:37:40,586
Do you mind if I sit down?

920
01:37:57,185 --> 01:37:59,358
Two minutes.
That's cutting it close, isn't it?

921
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:03,487
What is that? A car key?

922
01:38:07,571 --> 01:38:10,290
- The reflector?
- Salad bowls.

923
01:38:10,657 --> 01:38:12,601
Salad bowls?

924
01:38:12,701 --> 01:38:13,953
Why not?

925
01:38:15,579 --> 01:38:17,456
What did you use for the firing circuits?

926
01:38:18,582 --> 01:38:19,879
Photo strobes.

927
01:38:20,208 --> 01:38:21,585
Photo strobes.

928
01:38:25,088 --> 01:38:26,698
It's very pretty.

929
01:38:26,798 --> 01:38:27,799
Thanks.

930
01:38:29,092 --> 01:38:31,971
What do you say we take it apart
before everybody goes crazy?

931
01:38:32,512 --> 01:38:34,685
No, I'm sorry. I can't do that right now.

932
01:38:35,557 --> 01:38:36,958
This isn't accomplishing anything.

933
01:38:37,058 --> 01:38:38,126
- Sure it is.
- What?

934
01:38:38,226 --> 01:38:39,586
- Deterrence.
- Deterrence?

935
01:38:39,686 --> 01:38:43,006
You know, when each side
thinks the other will blow everybody up.

936
01:38:43,106 --> 01:38:44,633
It's called,
"Mutually assured destruction."

937
01:38:44,733 --> 01:38:46,030
Yeah, I know what it's called.

938
01:38:46,443 --> 01:38:47,786
It's working, isn't it?

939
01:38:48,445 --> 01:38:49,537
How do you mean?

940
01:38:50,030 --> 01:38:51,532
I'm still alive, aren't I?

941
01:38:56,328 --> 01:38:58,063
Don't talk like that.

942
01:38:58,163 --> 01:39:01,133
The thing is, I've been thinking about it.

943
01:39:03,335 --> 01:39:06,054
I don't think I'm crazy enough
to actually turn the key.

944
01:39:08,214 --> 01:39:09,215
No.

945
01:39:10,383 --> 01:39:12,385
That's the problem
with deterrence, isn't it?

946
01:39:14,554 --> 01:39:15,851
So I guess

947
01:39:16,765 --> 01:39:17,937
I blew it.

948
01:39:19,643 --> 01:39:20,895
What do you mean?

949
01:39:21,853 --> 01:39:23,355
I'm not getting out of here.

950
01:40:00,767 --> 01:40:02,144
Let me see it.

951
01:40:03,687 --> 01:40:04,939
Paul, give it to me.

952
01:40:08,066 --> 01:40:09,067
Come on.

953
01:40:11,736 --> 01:40:12,908
Give it to me.

954
01:40:53,194 --> 01:40:54,286
Hold it, gentlemen.

955
01:40:57,824 --> 01:40:59,497
Fellow sons of bitches.

956
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:04,543
We are what we are. Right?

957
01:41:09,085 --> 01:41:11,508
Here's my responsible act.

958
01:41:15,842 --> 01:41:17,435
I'm taking him out of here.

959
01:41:25,602 --> 01:41:28,713
Since you all like scenarios so much,

960
01:41:28,813 --> 01:41:30,611
I've got one for you.

961
01:41:31,691 --> 01:41:33,614
It's a game of chance.

962
01:41:34,903 --> 01:41:38,890
I bet you that I can turn this key

963
01:41:38,990 --> 01:41:43,203
and blow us all to hell,
even after you shoot me!

964
01:41:44,329 --> 01:41:46,047
And you'll have to shoot me, okay?

965
01:41:46,873 --> 01:41:51,219
Everybody's problems solved
in one millionth of a second.

966
01:41:56,549 --> 01:41:57,641
Now...

967
01:42:01,387 --> 01:42:02,855
Who wants to play?

968
01:42:18,279 --> 01:42:21,891
Red team, I do not want them off the
premises with that gadget. Do you copy?

969
01:42:21,991 --> 01:42:22,934
Please, not in the building.

970
01:42:23,034 --> 01:42:24,978
One stray bullet and we've
got a containment breach.

971
01:42:25,078 --> 01:42:26,796
- And that can mean...
- All right!

972
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:31,084
All right, listen.

973
01:42:32,752 --> 01:42:34,612
Yeah, copy, Command. No problem.

974
01:42:34,712 --> 01:42:37,431
Give me a clear shot
and I'll turn him off like a switch.

975
01:42:42,971 --> 01:42:46,646
You know, at least now I can publish.

976
01:42:47,267 --> 01:42:50,316
- What do you mean?
- I think I just blew my security clearance.

977
01:42:50,603 --> 01:42:53,197
- I'm sorry.
- It's no problem.

978
01:42:54,274 --> 01:42:56,242
Time for a change of vocations anyway.

979
01:42:58,570 --> 01:43:00,096
There must be a place
in the private sector

980
01:43:00,196 --> 01:43:03,120
for an unemployed nuclear
weapons designer, don't you think?

981
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:00,757
What? What?

982
01:44:03,509 --> 01:44:04,681
You turned it?

983
01:44:05,178 --> 01:44:07,476
No, no.
It happened by itself, spontaneously.

984
01:44:15,521 --> 01:44:16,522
Jesus.

985
01:44:18,524 --> 01:44:20,993
It's counting down. It's going to blow.

986
01:44:22,028 --> 01:44:23,429
Probably neutron flux.

987
01:44:23,529 --> 01:44:26,829
Radiation from the core can screw up
this kind of solid-state timing circuit.

988
01:44:27,367 --> 01:44:28,601
I never heard of that.

989
01:44:28,701 --> 01:44:31,124
Yeah. Well, live and learn.

990
01:44:36,709 --> 01:44:37,710
Gentlemen,

991
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:40,217
we've got a little

992
01:44:42,215 --> 01:44:43,307
wrinkle here.

993
01:44:46,010 --> 01:44:47,387
Listen carefully,

994
01:44:49,389 --> 01:44:51,141
and do exactly as I say.

995
01:45:42,442 --> 01:45:44,844
Well, at least we have
999 hours to dismantle it.

996
01:45:44,944 --> 01:45:46,137
I don't think so.

997
01:45:46,237 --> 01:45:48,956
Time-based circuits
tend to deteriorate exponentially,

998
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:51,038
faster and faster.

999
01:45:51,826 --> 01:45:53,499
Jesus, why did we bring it
back here, then?

1000
01:45:54,037 --> 01:45:56,586
Why not? Where do you want to take it?

1001
01:45:56,706 --> 01:45:58,650
- How about Treman Quarry?
- What?

1002
01:45:58,750 --> 01:46:02,737
Sure. It's a couple of square miles
at least, no one around. It's perfect.

1003
01:46:02,837 --> 01:46:04,305
A couple of square miles.

1004
01:46:04,964 --> 01:46:05,949
Paul, if this thing goes,

1005
01:46:06,049 --> 01:46:09,269
you're going to get a really good
view of a 50 to 70 kiloton explosion!

1006
01:46:10,219 --> 01:46:11,220
What?

1007
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:15,813
You don't know what you took, Paul.

1008
01:46:16,601 --> 01:46:18,252
This is special stuff. It's very nasty.

1009
01:46:18,352 --> 01:46:20,400
It's so hot,
we don't even know how to test it.

1010
01:46:21,439 --> 01:46:23,737
It's a miracle you didn't kill yourself
just carrying it home.

1011
01:46:25,234 --> 01:46:26,235
So,

1012
01:46:28,571 --> 01:46:31,324
if I unscrew this,
I can get the core out, right?

1013
01:46:32,408 --> 01:46:33,751
Yeah, yeah.

1014
01:46:34,869 --> 01:46:36,496
Got a screwdriver?

1015
01:46:37,330 --> 01:46:38,707
No, no, a bigger one.

1016
01:47:09,403 --> 01:47:12,031
- What?
- It's jammed.

1017
01:47:12,782 --> 01:47:13,874
Let me try.

1018
01:47:28,381 --> 01:47:31,492
It's funny, the same thing happened
at the Trinity test, 40 years ago.

1019
01:47:31,592 --> 01:47:32,889
Really?

1020
01:47:33,386 --> 01:47:36,014
The core got stuck halfway in
while they were trying to insert it.

1021
01:47:42,436 --> 01:47:44,734
I wouldn't bump it
around like that, if I were you.

1022
01:47:45,481 --> 01:47:47,483
It might decide to fire just for spite.

1023
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:51,742
So, what do we do?

1024
01:47:52,155 --> 01:47:53,577
- We could drill it.
- No, no.

1025
01:47:54,365 --> 01:47:55,767
We might get a static charge.

1026
01:47:55,867 --> 01:47:57,585
- Disconnect the batteries.
- No.

1027
01:47:58,077 --> 01:47:59,795
- What about sparks?
- Cut the main lead.

1028
01:48:02,081 --> 01:48:04,175
Yeah. That's worth a try.

1029
01:48:04,584 --> 01:48:07,337
- I'll need to remove the middle plate.
- Do it. Do it.

1030
01:48:09,338 --> 01:48:11,466
Anybody have a Phillips head screwdriver?

1031
01:48:33,362 --> 01:48:34,614
How much time do we have?

1032
01:48:35,156 --> 01:48:37,850
I don't know. It's an exponential decay.

1033
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:40,019
Can't you just answer
the goddamn question?

1034
01:48:40,119 --> 01:48:41,416
I was never good at math.

1035
01:48:42,205 --> 01:48:44,774
All right, as Y approaches infinity,

1036
01:48:44,874 --> 01:48:48,754
- T is equal to one plus one over N to the...
- To the nth.

1037
01:48:49,962 --> 01:48:50,947
Right.

1038
01:48:51,047 --> 01:48:53,141
You're a bright kid.
You should do something with it.

1039
01:48:53,674 --> 01:48:54,675
Okay.

1040
01:48:55,843 --> 01:48:57,561
I make it about...

1041
01:49:00,014 --> 01:49:01,516
Three minutes to zero.

1042
01:49:02,642 --> 01:49:03,643
Oh, boy.

1043
01:49:05,645 --> 01:49:07,989
Excuse me, sir, what about evacuation?

1044
01:49:08,731 --> 01:49:10,074
Evacuation? Of who?

1045
01:49:10,441 --> 01:49:11,442
The people.

1046
01:49:11,859 --> 01:49:15,659
You mean New York? Pennsylvania?
Vermont? Canada? Those people?

1047
01:49:16,072 --> 01:49:17,515
- I'm at the main connector.
- Okay, go ahead.

1048
01:49:17,615 --> 01:49:19,037
- Wire clippers.
- Yeah, right here.

1049
01:49:21,953 --> 01:49:22,895
What the hell is that?

1050
01:49:22,995 --> 01:49:25,481
Firing circuit. I programmed
the photo strobes to charge automatically

1051
01:49:25,581 --> 01:49:27,049
90 seconds from detonation.

1052
01:49:28,167 --> 01:49:30,194
The timer must be all messed up.

1053
01:49:30,294 --> 01:49:31,887
Maybe I should have made it 10 seconds.

1054
01:49:32,755 --> 01:49:34,073
Anyhow, look, it doesn't matter.

1055
01:49:34,173 --> 01:49:35,800
All I have to do is cut the power.

1056
01:49:36,759 --> 01:49:38,181
It's this wire, right over here.

1057
01:49:38,552 --> 01:49:42,182
All right, here I go. Ready? One, two...

1058
01:49:42,974 --> 01:49:45,978
No, no, no! Don't cut it!
Don't do anything!

1059
01:49:46,394 --> 01:49:48,087
Don't do anything? What are you, nuts?

1060
01:49:48,187 --> 01:49:50,047
Regular photographic strobe units?
That's what you used?

1061
01:49:50,147 --> 01:49:51,465
- Exactly.
- All right, here's the problem.

1062
01:49:51,565 --> 01:49:53,134
Once those things are charged,
even if you turn them off,

1063
01:49:53,234 --> 01:49:54,427
they can discharge while
you're unplugging them.

1064
01:49:54,527 --> 01:49:56,012
- What are you talking about?
- This thing could detonate

1065
01:49:56,112 --> 01:49:57,659
just from our trying to disconnect it.

1066
01:49:58,531 --> 01:49:59,874
Okay. Now.

1067
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:04,787
- Just wait.
- I'll wait. It won't wait.

1068
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:10,338
Okay. Okay.

1069
01:50:12,211 --> 01:50:14,714
Okay, now either
that thing is going to work or it's not.

1070
01:50:15,047 --> 01:50:17,617
If it's not going to work, we can all
just stand here till it reaches zero,

1071
01:50:17,717 --> 01:50:18,910
at which point nothing will happen.

1072
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:21,638
However, I think it's going to work.

1073
01:50:22,221 --> 01:50:24,624
- Which means we have to disarm it.
- How?

1074
01:50:24,724 --> 01:50:27,210
Cut the leads between
the photo strobes and high explosives.

1075
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:29,378
- How many leads are there?
- Six along this strip here.

1076
01:50:29,478 --> 01:50:31,631
Six leads, six wires.

1077
01:50:31,731 --> 01:50:35,235
Now, the trick is, we have to cut
them at exactly the same time.

1078
01:50:35,943 --> 01:50:38,071
- And I mean exactly.
- Or what?

1079
01:50:39,822 --> 01:50:41,849
- Shit, really?
- Come on, let's just do it.

1080
01:50:41,949 --> 01:50:43,246
Colonel, you'll count for us.

1081
01:50:43,576 --> 01:50:47,877
Give him the cutters.
You're number one, two, three, four, five...

1082
01:50:48,372 --> 01:50:49,498
You, over here.

1083
01:50:52,251 --> 01:50:53,653
This one's yours, right there.

1084
01:50:53,753 --> 01:50:56,256
Sorry about before, kid,
just doing my job, nothing personal.

1085
01:50:56,422 --> 01:50:57,423
300.

1086
01:50:58,716 --> 01:51:01,202
- Okay, everybody ready?
- Wait. I don't have a cutter.

1087
01:51:01,302 --> 01:51:03,225
Oh, my God.
Get us another cutter from over there.

1088
01:51:05,765 --> 01:51:07,142
Come on, come on, come on.

1089
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:12,272
I can't believe this.

1090
01:51:12,396 --> 01:51:15,491
You telling me I'm going to die 'cause
some asshole didn't bring a pair of pliers?

1091
01:51:17,068 --> 01:51:18,302
I got it. I got it.

1092
01:51:18,402 --> 01:51:20,346
- What is that? Is that going to work?
- I hope so.

1093
01:51:20,446 --> 01:51:21,447
210.

1094
01:51:22,615 --> 01:51:25,226
Okay, I'm going to count
backward from five.

1095
01:51:25,326 --> 01:51:26,811
- Everybody ready?
- Wait, wait.

1096
01:51:26,911 --> 01:51:28,458
Do we cut on one or on zero?

1097
01:51:28,662 --> 01:51:30,731
- 180.
- On zero, like this.

1098
01:51:30,831 --> 01:51:33,693
Three, two... This is just a rehearsal.
Nobody do anything.

1099
01:51:33,793 --> 01:51:36,672
Three, two, one, cut.
Everybody understand?

1100
01:51:37,046 --> 01:51:38,218
110.

1101
01:51:38,547 --> 01:51:41,141
Okay. Anybody want to make a bet?

1102
01:51:41,926 --> 01:51:43,035
No? Okay.

1103
01:51:43,135 --> 01:51:44,203
Here we go, for real, this time.

1104
01:51:44,303 --> 01:51:47,978
Five, four, three, two, one.

1105
01:52:02,029 --> 01:52:03,781
That was interesting.

1106
01:52:39,733 --> 01:52:41,260
What do you think you're doing?

1107
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:42,887
Letting a little fresh air in.

1108
01:52:42,987 --> 01:52:44,364
Get away from that door.

1109
01:52:45,156 --> 01:52:46,408
Give it up, Colonel.

1110
01:52:47,533 --> 01:52:49,035
We blew it!

1111
01:52:49,952 --> 01:52:52,146
What are you going to do,
make us all disappear?

1112
01:52:52,246 --> 01:52:53,247
Me?

1113
01:52:54,373 --> 01:52:55,499
And him?

1114
01:53:00,838 --> 01:53:01,839
And all of them?

1115
01:53:07,636 --> 01:53:08,888
Too many secrets.

1116
01:53:12,057 --> 01:53:13,274
Too many secrets.

1117
01:53:43,547 --> 01:53:45,424
Dr. Mathewson, remember Jenny?

1118
01:53:45,549 --> 01:53:46,846
- Hi.
- Hi.

1119
01:54:07,112 --> 01:54:08,489
- Paul!
- Mom.

1120
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:31,645
It's okay. I did something.

1121
01:54:36,809 --> 01:54:38,502
What happened?

1122
01:54:38,602 --> 01:54:39,819
Everything.

1123
01:54:40,354 --> 01:54:42,482
I'll tell you about it later.
Let's get out of here.

1123
