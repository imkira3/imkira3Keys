1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,495
<i>- Sure you don't wanna go to my room?
- No. Why?</i>

3
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,248
<i>My roommate's already moved
out. We'll be all alone.</i>

4
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,916
<i>- All right.
- The door is locked.</i>

5
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,876
<i>- Okay, Jim, relax. Relax.
- Okay, yeah, sure.</i>

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,088
<i>No strings attached, okay?
It's just friendly goodbye sex.</i>

7
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,674
Yeah, right. Right, right, right, right.

8
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,302
But you see, it's just that...

9
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,305
we've never even had friendly hello sex.

10
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:59,017
- So do you not wanna do this?
- Oh, no, no, no.

11
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,688
Oh, I do. Yeah. No, I definitely do.

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,357
It's just that...

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,776
you see, this is actually my first time.

14
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,946
Well, not my first.
It's my first time...

15
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,574
since my first time.

16
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,827
So, technically, that's my second time.

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,080
And I don't... I don't wanna suck at it.

18
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,583
So if I'm not up to
par, performance-wise...

19
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,336
Jim, this isn't exactly a turn-on.

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,131
I mean, girls like a
guy with confidence.

21
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,842
Hey, I'm confident.

22
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:36,096
Oh, I am... I'm absolutely,
totally confident.

23
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,349
- Let's get naked.
- Okay.

24
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,981
Seems like just yesterday my dad picked
me up after my first year at college.

25
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,193
We popped a couple of beers...

26
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,612
and he said, "Now, you're a man. "

27
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,031
And today I get to say
the same thing to my son.

28
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,200
Honey, your speeches embarrass him.

29
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,453
So, try and do what the
kids say, and just be cool.

30
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:03,165
I think I bring new meaning
to the word "cool," honey.

31
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,917
That's his dormitory up ahead.

32
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,351
Turn over.

33
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,277
- Can't bring alcohol in the dorms.
- Good.

34
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:36,490
Thank you, Matt. I'm just
here to surprise my son Jim.

35
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,700
- Now pin my leg up.
- What?

36
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,286
Pin my leg up, like this.

37
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,125
Maybe you can help me out, you know.

38
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,673
Is that the one? No.

39
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:53,674
There!

40
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,137
Now I remember.

41
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,684
I didn't do this for you.

42
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,352
Thanks, dude.

43
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,523
- Where's my big guy?
- Oh, my God!

44
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,905
- Jesus!
- Jim, we got here a little early.

45
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,157
- Dad, get out!
- I'll wait in the car.

46
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,742
Go, Dad! Oh, my...

47
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,871
- Jeez!
- Was that your dad?

48
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,373
- I'm so sorry.
- For your own edification...

49
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,833
son, I'm not embarrassed.

50
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,959
I am!

51
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:33,088
It's a perfectly normal thing
for two human beings to do.

52
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,257
This is human nature...
human nature at its best.

53
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,553
Son, everybody does it. Your mother
and I... Well, not so much any more.

54
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,014
Got your favourite. Oh,
my God! They're fucking!

55
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,309
Honey, honey, listen.
I'm gonna take her...

56
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,103
- Please just go!
- Actually, if you wouldn't mind.

57
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,606
Honey... I'll take her to the car.

58
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,401
- Hi, Mama.
- What?

59
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,736
Natalie!

60
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,237
I'm Jim's dad.

61
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,906
You must be the parents
of this young lady.

62
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,242
I'm sorry I didn't get her
name, but hopefully my son did...

63
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,244
because I have not been
here the whole time.

64
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,538
Natalie, get dressed!

65
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,291
- Beer?
- Avert your eyes! Turn around!

66
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,460
- Thanks, Jim. Don't believe in locks?
- Oh, my God!

67
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,190
Hey, fuckface.

68
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:37,152
- Mornin', dude.
- Come on, Ozzy. It's show time.

69
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,533
Before you go to Ann
Arbor to pick up Heather...

70
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,576
I wanna show you what you're missing.

71
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,039
See what they are today,
dude. See what they are today.

72
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,375
Okay, here we go. Moment of truth.

73
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,173
- There's little hearts on her panties!
- Super.

74
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:01,093
There's little hearts on her panties!
Come on, look, you pussy. Look.

75
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,595
What the fuck, man? Come on!

76
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,180
I'm disappointed in you.

77
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:08,183
Here it is, the end of our freshman
year and you screwed one girl.

78
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,352
One.

79
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,354
You're a disgrace to men everywhere.

80
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,440
Look at the Stifmeister. I
got laid 23 times this year...

81
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,902
and I'm not counting the hummer
I got in the library stacks, baby.

82
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,697
All right, here's a new
idea for you, Stifler, okay?

83
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,949
You find a girl. You
two become best friends.

84
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,910
You don't bother counting how many
times you have sex with each other.

85
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,622
- You laugh at the people who do count.
- Here's a new idea for you.

86
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,125
I'll get you a spoon
so you can eat my ass.

87
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,129
Okay, people, notebooks closed.
Let's get this exam rolling.

88
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,383
Oh, shit! Do we got an exam today?

89
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,052
- Are you kiddin' me?
- Bullshit.

90
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,600
Yes!

91
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,394
I'm never even gonna think
about political science again.

92
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,479
Hey. How'd you do?

93
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,690
- Fine.
- Yeah?

94
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,485
Can't believe I'm going abroad for
summer. Last thing I need is more classes.

95
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,488
- You're gonna have a great time.
- Hello, summer!

96
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,492
- Did that exam blow or what?
- Yeah, it sucked.

97
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,454
- Kev, what's up, man? How are you?
- Good.

98
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,706
Put your party hat on.

99
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,250
- We got 12 weeks of immortality ahead.
- Yes, sir!

100
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,677
Weird.

101
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:45,030
The one that got away, huh, son?

102
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,206
Well, evidently you two...

103
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,875
made quite the handsome
couple on the Internet.

104
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,380
I didn't see it.

105
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,967
It was brought up at a PTA meeting.

106
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,928
Anyway, my point is...

107
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,848
these little sexual debacles
should not get you down...

108
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,599
because you know what?

109
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,434
It happens to the best of us.

110
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,770
In fact...

111
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,815
the first time your mother and I...

112
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,567
got together...

113
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,901
I used a condom.

114
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,905
Well, she referred to
it as "shrink wrapping. "

115
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,201
But I got over it.

116
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,495
Anyway, keep your chin
up. You keep plugging...

117
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,123
and good things will happen.

118
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,750
Good to have you home, son.

119
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,215
It's good to be home, Dad.

120
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,135
It's gonna be nice to hit
Stifler's tonight after exams.

121
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,471
- Did you get through 'em?
- There's the mystery man!

122
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,223
Finch, how are you?

123
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,440
It's Japanese.

124
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,776
It means "hello. " Hello.

125
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,406
- Finch, what happened to Latin?
- Met a Japanese girl at the art museum.

126
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,533
Changed majors.

127
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,785
Wanted to understand the
things she was moaning.

128
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,705
- You got laid in an art museum?
- The Met.

129
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,250
- And the Guggenheim with Francesca.
- The Guggenheim?

130
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,378
And then my social-psych
professor in Baskin-Robbins.

131
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,963
All right, enough.

132
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:28,967
But I'll tell you, none of
these women even compare to...

133
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,552
Stifler's mom.

134
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,139
Stifler's mom is a goddess.

135
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,022
How about some more of
Stifmeister's collegiate concoction?

136
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,859
This thing is like half alcohol.
You're just trying to get me drunk.

137
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,363
Mary, would I do that?

138
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:53,992
- My name's Christy.
- Christy, right. Beautiful name.

139
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,536
Like it matters.

140
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,579
Hey, how you doing?

141
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,832
Howdy-howdy, fuckin' partners!

142
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,376
Johnny C., how's it
going? Good to see you.

143
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,587
Looks like someone
gained the freshman 15.

144
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,673
- This'll help.
- You're an asshole.

145
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,007
Missed you too.

146
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:12,970
All right, everybody
having a good time? Ladies?

147
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,431
Fellas! How's it going?

148
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:19,059
The keg's back there as always. Enjoy.

149
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:24,398
Ladies, I'm Steve Stifler
and I have an 11-inch penis...

150
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,608
around!

151
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,945
Think about it. Sherman!

152
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,115
Okay, Stifler, take your shot. Ha, ha.

153
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,201
Come on, man. I'm
really happy to see you.

154
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,787
All right.

155
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,706
You stupid fuck!

156
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:45,127
- Are you Steve Stifler?
- Yes, I am.

157
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,171
Thank you for throwing
this awesome party, man.

158
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,257
- No problem.
- The cops bust all our parties now.

159
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,720
Well, I put the word out so
high school chicks would come.

160
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,557
Just 'cause you fuckers don't have dicks
doesn't make it okay for you to be here.

161
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,395
- Hey, could I ask you a question?
- Sure, son.

162
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:07,232
Is it true that Paul
Finch nailed your mom?

163
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,777
Sons of bitches.

164
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,739
My mom's a saint!

165
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,283
The joke's on Finch!

166
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,411
Hey, Carlos, Jason.

167
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,914
What's goin' on? Keg's back on the deck.

168
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,416
How was Iowa State?

169
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,669
Did you see those fuckers
I had to boot out of here?

170
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:31,507
Back at Stifler's. It's
just like old times.

171
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,593
One difference. We're college men now.

172
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,095
Some of these girls are
from the grade below us.

173
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,348
I might actually have a chance.

174
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,309
Hey, I remember you.

175
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,188
Do you now?

176
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,857
You're that guy who blew
his load on the Internet.

177
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,612
Splat. "Oh, wait,
Nadia, don't go. " Splat.

178
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,157
- Pathetic.
- Loser.

179
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,826
It's exactly like old times.

180
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,290
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you.

181
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,378
I'll call you when I get in, okay?

182
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,796
Go have fun.

183
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,298
Bye.

184
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,980
I can't believe those two girls, Kevin.

185
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,982
Jim, it's not a big deal.

186
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,484
They toyed with my emotions.

187
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,737
- Hello. Hello.
- See? There's other girls.

188
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:39,700
- How are you?
- You got nothing to worry about, man.

189
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,785
Jessica's here.

190
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,371
With Vicky.

191
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,334
And Vicky got hot!

192
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,004
What's that supposed to mean?

193
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,338
Look at her.

194
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:57,009
- Yeah, Jim, I see her.
- Hey, Kevin.

195
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,928
I'll be right back.

196
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,267
- Hey, Vic, how are you?
- What's up?

197
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,311
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, I'm good.

198
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,437
That's good.

199
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,731
- It's good to hear.
- Yeah, you too.

200
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,609
Wow.

201
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,486
Well, this is about as comfortable
as a high colonic in Tijuana.

202
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,615
And I would know. Okay.

203
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,618
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- She's right.

204
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:26,121
- Why is this so weird?
- Actually, I have no idea.

205
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:29,625
See, I knew it. I knew
you'd be mature about this.

206
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,877
You know, and we could
still be friends, right?

207
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,880
I miss you, Kev.

208
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,468
Whoa.

209
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,639
Friends, right?

210
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:48,268
Yeah, right. I mean, I know you
said friends and I... I just...

211
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,730
I'm sorry. I was... It was just...

212
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,650
an old habit... a friend kiss.

213
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,193
Are you sure?

214
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,987
Vic, why wouldn't I
wanna be friends with you?

215
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:02,491
Look, we'll... we'll just do this, okay?

216
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,452
- Friends.
- Friends.

217
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,834
- Ozzy, my man!
- There he is.

218
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,878
Shake off your chains of
monogamy? You're a free man.

219
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:18,423
I don't think so, Stifler. I'll
never turn over to the dark side.

220
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:21,844
Dumb ass. What happened to
the Nova I knew in high school?

221
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,805
Nova, as in Casanova, the
guy who had all the moves.

222
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,267
- He was an idiot.
- Yeah, but he was my idiot.

223
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,186
Hey, everyone, listen up!

224
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,355
Nova's back, baby...

225
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,316
and he's taken the lock off his cock!

226
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,821
Ozzy, I'm lobbing you a softball.

227
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,198
Pull out your bat and take a swing.

228
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,533
Mandy.

229
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:49,913
This is my friend, Oz. All-state
lacrosse two years in a row.

230
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,791
- Hi, Oz.
- Mandy, how are you?

231
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,586
Listen. I have a girlfriend.

232
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,880
It was a pleasure meeting you.

233
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,965
Beer out back?

234
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,635
You pussy!

235
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,024
Stifler's mom's room.

236
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,833
How did you do that magic you did?

237
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:54,937
Tantra.

238
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,027
What the fuck are you doin' in here?

239
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,863
- Just relax.
- You get out of my house!

240
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,449
- Jesus Christ!
- Come back here, you little fucker!

241
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,701
Come back here, you son of a bitch!

242
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,121
Easy! That's enough.

243
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,916
Okay, guys, we went through
this last summer, all right?

244
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,293
Finch got a black eye and
Stifler got six stitches.

245
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:19,753
'Cause he fuckin' bit me!

246
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,296
You touch me, I bite.

247
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,675
- You two relax and shake hands.
- Shake this.

248
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,097
I need a drink.

249
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,141
Why is everybody
taking a piss right now?

250
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:36,854
- Line's too long. I ain't gonna make it.
- You'll be okay. Relax.

251
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:40,482
Hey, bro. Hey, man, you're the
guy who boned Stifler's mom.

252
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,527
- Hey, you are a god.
- Holy shit, dude.

253
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,447
If I didn't have to hold my dick 'cause
I gotta piss, I would shake your hand.

254
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,992
- I'm honored, guys.
- Don't leave.

255
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,828
You must teach me. How?

256
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:53,787
How?

257
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,708
Look what I found, Christy.

258
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,460
What a coincidence.

259
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:07,551
I've been saving this
for a special occasion...

260
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,929
for a special girl, just like you.

261
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,433
- You're so sweet.
- That's what they say.

262
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,934
Weird.

263
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,313
- Oh, my God.
- I spilled some on you.

264
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,648
- Maybe I should mop that up.
- Thanks.

265
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,025
No problem.

266
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,776
Whoa! Whoa, hey.

267
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,030
- Take it slow. Come on.
- Right.

268
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:31,450
You know, they warn us about
these situations in college.

269
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:36,538
Now, you may be intoxicated.

270
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:38,582
Oh, yeah.

271
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,418
Are you certain that you wish
to engage in consenting...

272
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,046
Hey, don't count your chickens, buster.

273
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:48,342
- I'm just playing by the rules, baby.
- I make the rules.

274
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,677
That's a pretty good fucking rule.

275
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:58,227
Dude, the line's too
long. I'll never make it.

276
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,229
It's gotta happen now. Get my back.

277
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,655
- Clamp it off.
- Hello.

278
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,408
- How are you?
- Awesome.

279
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,537
- How are you?
- I'm really good.

280
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,082
How 'bout I give you a little champagne?

281
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,042
Go downstairs and get us some beers?

282
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,462
I've got a surprise for you.
Close your eyes and get ready.

283
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,172
I'm ready.

284
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,844
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, all right.

285
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,683
Okay, go.

286
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:43,522
This is kind of kinky, and I like that.

287
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,905
That's it. Bathe the Stifmeister.

288
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,286
Oh, that's great!

289
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,538
That's great.

290
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,665
How did you get it so nice and warm?

291
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,796
I can taste the bubbles.

292
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,217
Actually, I can't.

293
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,391
Much better.

294
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:23,645
Wait a second.

295
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,523
- Let's go.
- Thanks, man.

296
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,402
Christy?

297
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,615
Oh, fuck!

298
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:42,289
Yep. Half these got East
High parking passes on them.

299
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,334
Gotta break up another one.
Call in a couple of units.

300
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,420
- Isn't this the Stifler house?
- Yeah. Ever seen Mrs Stifler?

301
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:51,757
- What a MILF!
- Yeah? She got all that?

302
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,718
Okay, now...

303
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,262
do these high school
kids think we're cool...

304
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,389
because they're at a college party...

305
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:02,643
or are we those weird older guys...

306
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,270
that try to hang out with high
school kids when we come home?

307
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:08,524
No way. We're definitely not those guys.

308
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:09,983
Cops! Cops!

309
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,153
Break it up. Party's over.

310
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,280
Let's go.

311
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,574
Ostreicher, Myers.

312
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,326
Welcome back.

313
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,620
Where's Steve Stifler?

314
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:29,753
I got peed on.

315
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,049
<i>No, man, Stifler's got shut down.</i>

316
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,969
We can't party anywhere any more.

317
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,513
And things are...

318
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:42,891
<i>- Getting weird?
- Yeah, a little bit.</i>

319
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,394
First summer back from college.

320
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,272
Yep, things are gonna get weirder.

321
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,733
- What are you talkin' about?
- Well, times change, people change.

322
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,735
<i>It's just what happens, you now.</i>

323
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,406
Kev, listen. Go into my old room.

324
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:01,076
<i>My friends and I knew that it
was up to us to stick together.</i>

325
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,913
<i>You remember my first college summer?
We rented the lake house in Grand Harbor.</i>

326
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:08,125
<i>We treated every day out there
lie it was a post-prom party.</i>

327
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,086
<i>Hell of a time. We capped it
all off with a massive blow-out.</i>

328
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,255
<i>Best ever. It was legendary.</i>

329
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,674
<i>My advice is do that. By
the end of the summer...</i>

330
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,635
<i>you're gonna see the big picture.</i>

331
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:37,070
- She's on the phone.
It's long-distance. - Who?

332
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,780
- Nadia! Nadia!
- What?

333
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:42,576
New York. Hello. Yes,
dear, he's right here.

334
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,703
- Here. Wait.
- Now remember...

335
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,956
<i>Yes, I am sure to go see the Lion King.</i>

336
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,126
<i>Right. And don't ride
the subway after midnight.</i>

337
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,963
I know they've done wonderful things
with that city, but, you know, for me...

338
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:58,175
- Dad!
- He's right... Hang on.

339
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,433
<i>- How was college?
- College was excellent.</i>

340
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:09,478
Yeah. Yeah, it was...
it was really excellent.

341
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:12,189
You have not forgotten
about me, have you?

342
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,609
No. I... Absolutely not.

343
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,987
<i>- I definitely didn't.
- Good, because guess what.</i>

344
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,281
I'm coming to see you
at the end of summer.

345
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,909
<i>I hope you're ready for me...</i>

346
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:28,622
<i>because I have not forgotten
about you either, you sexy boy.</i>

347
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,333
- Shit.
- Jim, you can eat hot dogs tomorrow.

348
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,795
No, Finch, it's not the hot dogs.

349
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,797
Nadia called me this morning.

350
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,050
She's coming here at the end of
the summer and she wants to see me.

351
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,303
- That's killer.
- Yeah, that's a good thing.

352
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,265
No, not "good thing. " Not "killer. "

353
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,475
I'll never be able to do it.

354
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,437
Nadia is gonna be
expecting filet mignon.

355
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:57,025
Okay, and all I'm gonna
be able to give her...

356
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,694
is rump roast.

357
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,281
Come on.

358
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,825
Jim, you've had experience since Nadia.

359
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,827
Ah, yes, you would be referring to...

360
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,289
the flute-fetish band geek that made me
her bitch, then ditched me after prom.

361
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,457
Yes, that's great experience.

362
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:16,044
You just gotta find
the right girl, Jimbo.

363
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:18,130
- Brings it all together.
- I had the right woman.

364
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:22,301
She just sells her cottage
and takes off to parts unknown.

365
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,971
My romantic life has passed its peak.

366
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,223
Take me out to the pasture and shoot me.

367
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:33,020
Super start to a super
summer, fellas. Welcome home.

368
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,483
Guys, I got it. Pack your bags.

369
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:39,818
For what?

370
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:41,987
We're moving to the lake.

371
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:48,452
We're gonna be the shit. Everybody
on the beach is gonna know us.

372
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,246
Plenty of opportunities
to practice for Nadia.

373
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,583
Throw a huge party at the end
of the summer to cap it all off.

374
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:58,295
Dude, that's a great idea. That way
we'll be able to welcome Heather back...

375
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,423
and we'll be able to prepare
for Nadia's big arrival.

376
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:05,135
This is it. This is my summer of love.

377
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,429
Just thought I'd say
goodbye to you animals.

378
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:09,765
Hey, Mr Levenstein. How are you, sir?

379
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:14,102
- All packed up, I see.
- We're all set, Dad.

380
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,688
Don't worry, okay? I'll be fine.

381
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,732
Come on and give your old man a hug.

382
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,037
Keep it real, homies.

383
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,331
You too, sir. Have a good summer.

384
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,626
All right, let's go.

385
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,545
I've been running these numbers here...

386
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:42,172
and I don't think the four
of us can afford this place.

387
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:46,009
- Not on summer jobs.
- Well, I kinda thought of that.

388
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:50,222
So, I invited someone else.

389
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:56,436
Oh, yeah! The Stifmeister's
coming back to Grand Harbor!

390
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,022
Deck the halls! Bye-bye, Great Falls!

391
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:01,358
Wipe my ass and lick my balls!

392
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,735
It's Stifler time, baby!

393
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:22,379
Stifler, if you're gonna be living
with us, you gotta behave yourself.

394
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:26,341
All right, you and Finch just
stay out of each other's way.

395
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:29,178
Kevin, Stifler's stench is unavoidable.

396
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,346
Finch, fist yourself.

397
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,601
That's right, baby. We're here.

398
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,395
Yeah, baby, we're here!

399
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,550
- It's a palace.
- It's a temple.

400
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,388
Isn't this great?

401
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,225
Are you kidding me?

402
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,159
This just won't do.

403
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,361
Guys.

404
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:14,575
Check this out. This is it.

405
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:28,463
Will you idiots tell me
what this fucker's doin'?

406
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,972
Don't touch me while I'm tantric.

407
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,559
"Tantric?" What the fuck is tantric?

408
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:42,311
It's a Buddhist discipline.

409
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:47,065
You learn to channel your
body's energies... your chakras.

410
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:51,028
When you can do that, you can
have sex for hours, even days.

411
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,654
And this stuff's for real?

412
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:55,157
It's been around for centuries.

413
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,618
With tantra you can make
an entire session of sex...

414
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,621
feel like one giant orgasm.

415
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:04,541
Eventually, you can sustain
that feeling by meditating.

416
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:07,878
- Maybe you can teach me sometime?
- Very doubtful.

417
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,172
- True.
- Come on, Jim.

418
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:13,509
- You can't possibly be that bad.
- Oh, no?

419
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,802
No way.

420
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:19,681
I guess there's only one person
that really knows for sure, huh?

421
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:22,351
Oh, yeah? Where is she this summer?

422
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,535
Hey, are you here for the
mid-session performance?

423
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:41,745
Guests go in the amphitheatre.
You can't be here.

424
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,789
Do you know where I could
find Michele Flaherty?

425
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:46,875
Guests bring food. Food attracts
animals. This one time...

426
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:49,336
a bear came, and then the
bear had to be destroyed...

427
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,339
which means they shot it in the head
with a rifle and killed it and it died.

428
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,008
You must know Michele.

429
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,261
One, two, three, four.

430
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:17,406
That's a lot of flutes.

431
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:24,163
Good luck. Thanks.

432
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:26,957
Good job. Have fun at your next class.

433
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,048
Jim. Holy potatoes!

434
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:38,343
You're really here?

435
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:39,553
Oh, shoot!

436
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,722
We're not supposed to have visitors...

437
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,058
'cause this one time, here...

438
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,352
this kid had these cookies...

439
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:50,230
Let me guess. A bear came.

440
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:51,398
Cool.

441
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,734
It's like you know all our stories.

442
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,613
Was that a question?

443
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:59,740
I don't know. Maybe.

444
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,075
Do you wanna answer it anyway?

445
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,915
I left you like... like
three messages after prom.

446
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,291
Really?

447
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:12,127
You didn't think I was weird...

448
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,713
because of the way I acted that night?

449
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,466
Weird, no.

450
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,635
Surprising, yes.

451
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,095
I get nasty when I'm horny.

452
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:24,681
That's kind of why I'm here.

453
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:29,645
You remember, was I any good that night?

454
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,773
Wow. Jeez.

455
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,608
How could I forget?

456
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:38,570
You sucked. You didn't know
what the hell you were doing.

457
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:42,241
But wasn't it fun even
though you were so terrible?

458
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:45,244
- I'm sorry. "Terrible?"
- I've had worse.

459
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,039
Sorry.

460
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:52,334
I could give you some
pointers if you want.

461
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,752
Really?

462
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:59,258
Shoot. Okay, wait here. I'll
meet you in an hour, okay?

463
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:01,218
- Yeah.
- Wait.

464
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,428
Cool idea.

465
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:14,898
What are you doing?

466
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:20,529
You're all right. Here we go. You know
you're not supposed to be here now.

467
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:24,533
Everyone's supposed to be in the
amphitheatre. All right, come on.

468
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:27,035
It's piss-poor to be this
late. I'm very angry right now.

469
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,038
You can tell by the tone of my
voice I'm angry. I'm pissed off.

470
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:32,374
Here they are. Got him home.

471
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,459
Wait a minute. Are you Petey?

472
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:37,629
Yeah, sure.

473
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:40,174
Petey! Well, that explains everything.

474
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:42,885
All right. Well, always
something with these kids. Go!

475
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:47,181
We are just so thrilled to have you.
None of my kids are at your caliber.

476
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,308
But we are just so overjoyed...

477
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,727
to have someone with
your kind of talent here.

478
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,520
Here you go.

479
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:55,731
Look at this. Your old best friend.

480
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,691
I know it's not yours...

481
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,860
but you are going to
make beautiful music.

482
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:02,029
This is fantastic. I'm very excited.

483
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:05,491
You just own this and break a leg.

484
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,260
What was he doing
wandering unsupervised?

485
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:27,095
Who knows?

486
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:30,724
I'll tell you something. I'm about
fed up with these Tall Oaks North kids.

487
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:40,275
Kids, entertain yourselves.
Play along with Petey.

488
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,195
No, no, no, Petey. Here we go.

489
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,739
All right, all right. Come on,
now. A little encouragement.

490
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,328
Folks, he's just a little nervous.

491
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:54,206
This isn't right.

492
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:56,208
Just blow on it, kid. All right.

493
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,876
Here we go.

494
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,932
Play! Do something.

495
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,070
Special, my ass.

496
00:32:25,154 --> 00:32:27,447
Come on. Give the
little guy some support.

497
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:32,828
Come on, Petey. You're
doing great, partner.

498
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:36,373
Come on, honey. You can do it.

499
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:38,083
Come on, Petey.

500
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,753
What the hell.

501
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,342
All right!

502
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:51,388
All right, Petey! Come on, now! Come on!

503
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:54,266
Rock and roll!

504
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:38,310
Thank you!

505
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,232
Thank you, Tall Oaks. You're beautiful.

506
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,489
My name is Petey!

507
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:54,034
Thank you!

508
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:57,037
And I have gigantic balls!

509
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,265
Not now! Come back later. Go!

510
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:22,563
Hey, hey, hey. Come back here!

511
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:25,899
- I wanna talk to you!
- You are so sweet.

512
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:28,902
He is special.

513
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,446
He's my bitch.

514
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,617
Well, Michele has confirmed it.

515
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:39,121
- I suck.
- What?

516
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,999
I gotta get some practice.

517
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:45,419
Don't worry about it. I mean,
that's why we got the house, Jimbo.

518
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:49,798
We plop a keg on the deck and
the girls come in off the beach.

519
00:34:49,882 --> 00:34:52,968
It's like a hummingbird feeder.

520
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:55,971
- You think so?
- I know so.

521
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,973
Guaranteed hotties.

522
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,684
Fellas, nice pad.

523
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:03,729
Good view, but...

524
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:07,232
the Sherminator sensors detect no
female life forms in the vicinity.

525
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:11,653
High likelihood of a
sausage fest in progress.

526
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,114
The girls are coming. I made some calls.

527
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,703
The Sherminator's got a point, Kev.

528
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:23,790
Since when do you start
listening to the Sherminator?

529
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:27,753
Since he made me realize there's
an abundance of wiener here.

530
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:30,380
I mean, look around, dude.

531
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:32,674
All right, now it's your turn.

532
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:34,718
Come on. There's nothing to tell.

533
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:38,305
Hey, what's up? What are
you guys talking about?

534
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,599
You know, we're just trading
war stories about college...

535
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,101
who hooked up with who,
who slept with who...

536
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:45,395
So, Vicky?

537
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:49,483
Well, there was this
one guy. How 'bout you?

538
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:52,194
You know, there was a few girls...

539
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,278
three.

540
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:56,240
Look at you. You stud.

541
00:35:57,658 --> 00:35:59,868
All right, Oz. Now that
Kevin told us, what about you?

542
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:03,413
You haven't had the slightest bit
of attraction to any girl at school?

543
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:06,375
Don't you fuckin' say
no. I know you did.

544
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:09,378
Even if I did...

545
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:12,589
it wouldn't be anything more
than just a momentary thing.

546
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:15,676
Very uninteresting.

547
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:18,720
How about you, Jessica? How many
chicks did you sleep with this year?

548
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:20,639
Gee, wouldn't you like to know.

549
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:23,684
Fuck yeah, I would.

550
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:26,895
Come on, Ozzy.

551
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:29,398
Yeah, man. Ball. Pool's yours.

552
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:32,401
- Hey, Vic, you wanna play?
- Yeah, sure. You wanna break?

553
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,409
Where are the fuckin' females?

554
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:45,205
Jim, can't you leave your shirt
on? You're scaring the chicks away.

555
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:47,499
Dude, give him a break.

556
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:50,752
Ozzy, go deep.

557
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:53,422
- Yeah, bro. You playing?
- No.

558
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:58,302
No, keep going. Flank pattern.

559
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:00,846
- What are you doin'?
- Fishin'.

560
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,897
Are you okay?

561
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:15,360
- You okay?
- I'm so sorry. Is everybody okay?

562
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:23,827
Amazing.

563
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:28,957
The Force is strong in that one.

564
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,335
Whoa.

565
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:37,090
The Sherminator detects serious
heat at a distance of two meters.

566
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:39,134
Preparing to deploy beer.

567
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:45,807
Dude, let me give you a
valuable piece of advice, okay?

568
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:47,518
Drop the whole "Sherminator" thing.

569
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:49,728
Please repeat previous statement.

570
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:52,689
Look, I know your last
name is Sherman, right?

571
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:55,359
<i>And that rhymes with The Terminator...</i>

572
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:57,861
which was a big hit movie ten years ago.

573
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:00,781
But you can't tell me a
girl's ever really gone for it.

574
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:04,868
<i>System overload. Hasta
la vista, Jessica.</i>

575
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:09,373
Freak.

576
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:14,545
Vic, hey, you guys are leaving?

577
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:18,382
You know, we barely had a chance
to hang out, you know, catch up.

578
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:21,802
- What are you doing this weekend?
- I can get together.

579
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:24,137
- Cool. Let's hang out.
- All right.

580
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:26,807
- Bye, Kev.
- See ya, Jess.

581
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:32,813
No, no, that's all wrong.

582
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:36,066
Thank you. Have a nice day.

583
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:39,069
- So what does he mean, "meet up"?
- You know, like hang out...

584
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:40,696
grab lunch, whatever.

585
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:44,408
I told you, we're just friends
now. And he totally understands.

586
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:48,120
- I'm sure he understands quite well.
- He does.

587
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:52,499
Oh, no, sir. These are all
wrong for you. I mean, seriously.

588
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,586
Sure. Well, we're friends.

589
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:59,173
But it's not like I see her
making plans with anyone else.

590
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:02,885
I don't see her with a boyfriend.
I think that puts me on deck.

591
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:07,681
Hey, Vicky only slept with
one guy since we went out.

592
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:12,186
I mean, that like makes me 50%
of her entire guy-related life.

593
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,229
You dipshit.

594
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:17,482
She didn't sleep with one guy.
She slept with at least three.

595
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:19,193
What?

596
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:21,361
When a girl tells you how
many guys she slept with...

597
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:23,447
multiply it by three and
that's the real number.

598
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,533
Didn't you fuckers learn
anything at college?

599
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:32,331
He did not sleep with three girls,
much like Sly and the Family Stone...

600
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,791
aren't gonna dance in
here and gang-bang me...

601
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:37,419
between the afros and
the bell-bottoms, okay?

602
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,879
It's not gonna happen.

603
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:42,799
- Kevin did not sleep with three girls.
- Why would he lie to me?

604
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,886
It's not a lie. It's an
adjustment. The rule of three.

605
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:47,930
- The rule of what?
- Three.

606
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:51,642
If a guy tells you how many girls he's
been with, it's not even close to that.

607
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:54,978
Take that number and divide it by
three. Then you get the real total.

608
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:59,024
So, if Kevin's saying it's been three
girls, it's more like one, or none.

609
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:01,652
- None?
- Rule of three.

610
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,112
It's an exact science,
consistent as gravity.

611
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:07,449
Ozzy, I'm happy for you.

612
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:10,118
At least you've seen a nice bod
while Heather's off suckin' dick.

613
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:12,204
Keep your fantasies to yourself.

614
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:14,706
Dude, use your fuckin' brain.

615
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,252
"I'm the American
college chick. La, la, la.

616
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:20,796
Your European cultural
shit is so charming.

617
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,550
Hot Spanish guy. Love your accent.

618
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:26,552
Love your ding-dong. "

619
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:30,639
I'm tellin' you, right now there is
a dick in your girlfriend's mouth.

620
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:33,892
- Knock it off.
- What'd I say?

621
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:54,413
Oh, my God!

622
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:59,209
Guys, check it out.

623
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:02,254
Lesbians.

624
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:03,672
Lesbians live here.

625
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,758
You know, Mr Homophobic Wizard...

626
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:11,013
that it is possible for women
to hold hands and not be gay.

627
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:12,681
Friends can hold hands.

628
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:15,893
Hey, Finch, I don't wanna hear
about you and your boyfriends.

629
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:19,188
- Go jerk off.
- Unnecessary.

630
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:21,732
Tantra teaches you to
hold an orgasm over time...

631
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:24,276
in anticipation of an ultimate moment...

632
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:26,778
to release it upon the world.

633
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:29,114
I'm filling up to the brim.

634
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:33,619
That's fucking disgusting!
I'm gonna throw up.

635
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,961
Hey, Heather. You're in!

636
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:45,881
How's the studying going?

637
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,925
I'd hardly call it studying.

638
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:49,927
I've been going to the Picasso museum...

639
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,387
hanging out at Sagrada Familia...

640
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:54,890
going with Pierre to the Parc Guell.

641
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:57,476
<i>- Who's Pierre?
- One of the guys in the program.</i>

642
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:00,395
He's got a girlfriend back in France,
so we've kind of got something in common.

643
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,147
That sounds cool.

644
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:06,485
Yeah, I've overheard them
on the phone at night.

645
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:10,322
And, well, it made me think.

646
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:14,284
<i>Hey, Oz, I'm reaching under my
shirt and I'm rubbing myself.</i>

647
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:19,331
Oz, come on. It's phone
sex. Help me out here.

648
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:20,874
Okay.

649
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:26,755
I'm going over to my bed.

650
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,175
<i>and I'm lying down.</i>

651
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,719
And I'm slowly...

652
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:36,181
reaching downstairs.

653
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:38,016
Grab it. Tell me how big it is.

654
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:42,604
Listen, Heather, I'm
feeling kind of awkward.

655
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:46,441
If we can't be with each other, then
we have to learn to be more vocal.

656
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:48,944
<i>- Right?
- Right. Okay.</i>

657
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:53,699
Okay, here we go. I'm
reaching in my pants now.

658
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,492
And I'm rubbing it for you, Heather.

659
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:58,370
And it feels so good.

660
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:00,747
<i>- Yeah, me too.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

661
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,666
I got...

662
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:03,959
Call waiting.

663
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:06,753
Shit. Hello?

664
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:10,507
Wrong number.

665
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:13,552
Hey. Hello. Wrong number.

666
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:19,141
All right, look, man. I got my
hand on my dick right now, okay...

667
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:21,727
and I'm trying to have sex with
my girlfriend over the phone.

668
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,730
<i>Good for you, man.</i>

669
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:31,778
Sorry about that. Where were we?

670
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:34,198
I think you were reaching for something.

671
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:36,366
Oh, yeah.

672
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:41,413
Oh, yeah, Heather. I'm rubbing
it and it feels so good.

673
00:43:42,372 --> 00:43:46,168
Hey, Oz, I'm touching myself.
What else do you want me to do?

674
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,670
<i>Heather, baby.</i>

675
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:51,548
Why don't you tell me my
dick is as big as Stifler's.

676
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:52,716
Stifler, get off!

677
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:55,969
I am getting off just listening
to the two of you guys.

678
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:58,847
- Keep going.
- We should try this another time.

679
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:01,850
Yeah, all right. Bye. I love you.

680
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:05,187
- I love you.
- Come on you, guys. I was almost there!

681
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,273
- Nice talking with you, Steven.
- Stifler, man!

682
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:11,276
Repressed.

683
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:22,579
Check it out.

684
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:24,998
<i>Potential lesbians leaving the building.</i>

685
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:35,300
All right. Now is my chance.

686
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:38,011
I need confirmation.

687
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:40,180
Stifler. Hey, man, what are you doing?

688
00:44:40,264 --> 00:44:41,974
Go get him.

689
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:43,517
You ass. Stifler, get out.

690
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:53,735
Shit, dude! I found a dildo!

691
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,947
Big blue rubber dicks for everyone!

692
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:00,450
- The people demand rubber dicks!
- Finch, help.

693
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:02,995
Dildo, dildo, dildo!

694
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:08,000
- What are you doing?
- Looking for more lesbian artifacts.

695
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:11,378
- Where'd you get this?
- Finch's ass.

696
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:14,590
Shit! Guys, they're back.

697
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:18,218
Stall 'em!

698
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:21,180
Come on. Come on!

699
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:24,266
- Come on. Come on.
- This is awesome!

700
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:26,602
Danielle, Amber, hi.

701
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:29,688
Just needed the paper, huh?

702
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:35,777
- Which room?
- I can't remember. I was too excited.

703
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:38,405
- I'm in a lesbian stronghold.
- Was it in here?

704
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:41,825
- Why you asking me so many questions?
- Was it in here?

705
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:44,620
- Maybe.
- Was it or was it not here?

706
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:47,539
Happy painting, boys.

707
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:51,043
You gotta get out of
there. They're inside.

708
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:52,377
Oh, shit, balls!

709
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:01,136
- Very original, Steven.
- Don't call me Steven.

710
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,985
I can wear that little
leopard bikini of mine.

711
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:19,738
I love that one. It's so cute on you.

712
00:46:19,822 --> 00:46:21,365
Help me zip, please.

713
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:28,205
- Did I show you my cute pink shoes?
- Does it match your pink bikini?

714
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:30,249
<i>They're getting naked.</i>

715
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,671
- Cute.
- Thank you.

716
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,347
Shit. She's de-pantsing.

717
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,224
Oh, man.

718
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:51,436
Wait. They can't hear us inside?
We won't cross over their radio?

719
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,690
<i>No, man. These work on a CB frequency.</i>

720
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:56,608
<i>This girl is so hot.</i>

721
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:04,575
Two possible lesbians in
their bras and panties.

722
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:05,784
Lesbians?

723
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:09,371
<i>Did you say lesbians?</i>

724
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:10,873
Hot lesbians!

725
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:16,420
- Don't touch me.
- I'm not.

726
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:28,515
That better not have been
what I thought it was.

727
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,353
This is not gonna fit.
Look at you and look at me.

728
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:36,690
- Too big.
- I'll get you the blue stringy number.

729
00:47:39,485 --> 00:47:41,361
Johnny West is missing.

730
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:45,073
Maybe you kicked it under the bed.

731
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:48,494
Okay, let me look.

732
00:47:48,577 --> 00:47:51,413
Wait. Didn't you have it
when we were downstairs?

733
00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:52,915
Maybe.

734
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:59,838
Guys, get the hell
out of there right now.

735
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:02,841
Come on!

736
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:05,344
- It's clear!
- Go, go, go!

737
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:12,309
They're coming back.

738
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:21,318
I'm just so glad I found him.
He's my favourite collectible.

739
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:22,861
I know.

740
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:28,116
Guys, we got nothin' to worry about.

741
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,161
I just remembered, I got that
dildo from the other bedroom.

742
00:48:34,957 --> 00:48:37,876
Holy shit! There's a dildo in my drawer.

743
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,419
Oh, my God!

744
00:48:39,503 --> 00:48:41,630
You could have asked me
if you wanted to borrow it.

745
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:44,383
Stop it.

746
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:49,930
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. Call 911.

747
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,185
- No 911.
- Don't call the police.

748
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:59,148
- My God, it's the painting kids.
- I'm still calling the cops.

749
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:01,191
Okay, no, no, no. This isn't right.

750
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:04,528
- Look. Stifler did break in here.
- You dick!

751
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:07,197
But we just followed
him in to get him out.

752
00:49:08,824 --> 00:49:11,493
I just wanted proof that you
chicks are really lesbians.

753
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:19,168
You wanna mess with 'em?

754
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:21,170
Yeah, it'll be fun.

755
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:23,380
Let's do it.

756
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:26,842
You guys like that?

757
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:37,519
Ozzy, stand by for confirmation.

758
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:41,773
That's a big 10-4 on the confirmation.

759
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:46,945
Sounds like your little
friends outside wanna play too.

760
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:52,326
You won't be needing this.

761
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:56,121
Who wants me to touch Amber?

762
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:58,874
<i>I do, I do.</i>

763
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:01,585
- Who the hell is that?
- Who's this?

764
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:05,172
This is John... Smith.

765
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:09,384
I'm turning off my radio now.

766
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:13,722
Okay. Where should I touch Amber?

767
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:16,183
Ass, baby. Feel that ass!

768
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:22,105
That's nice.

769
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:29,154
I know. You feel his ass first.

770
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:31,448
Excuse me?

771
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:34,368
Yeah, I like that. That's good.

772
00:50:34,451 --> 00:50:37,704
I got some painting I should...

773
00:50:37,788 --> 00:50:40,666
Jim, hold on. I can handle it.

774
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:43,043
- What?
- I'm comfortable with my sexuality.

775
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:45,587
And I would love to see that show.

776
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:47,840
Bravo!

777
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:54,096
One finger on the cheek.

778
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:56,265
We want...

779
00:50:56,348 --> 00:50:59,059
palm grasping.

780
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:02,146
That's too much. No, no, no.

781
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,273
You don't touch, we don't touch.

782
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:07,818
- Squeeze his ass, son. You'll like it.
- Come on, boys.

783
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:11,530
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, shit.

784
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:15,951
I'm touching his ass.
I'm touching his ass.

785
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:19,580
Red Leader, what's your position?

786
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:22,583
<i>I'm touching his ass.
I'm touching his ass.</i>

787
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:23,584
Mommy!

788
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:25,961
You can go.

789
00:51:26,044 --> 00:51:27,963
That really wasn't bad.

790
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:30,549
- I wanna go home.
- That's too bad.

791
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:35,262
Never mind. I'm staying.

792
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:37,806
Danielle is feeling my breasts.

793
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:42,352
No way, dude!

794
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:44,146
<i>Her breasts are so luscious.</i>

795
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:46,732
What a wonderful Christmas
gift you bought the boys.

796
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,276
<i>My nipples are so hard.</i>

797
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:52,112
I think I can fix these.

798
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,245
Sweet Jesus.

799
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:03,457
Your turn.

800
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:06,126
Oh, yeah!

801
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,753
No, no, no.

802
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:10,964
Him.

803
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:16,512
Kiss.

804
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:19,014
Dude, no.

805
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:22,518
- Wait. What?
- You want more?

806
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:25,103
We want more. Go get him, tiger.

807
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:27,981
- You're gonna love it.
- Do it for us.

808
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:33,153
Okay, dude.

809
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,241
One, two...

810
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:40,536
three.

811
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:43,705
- That doesn't even count.
- That totally counted.

812
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:46,291
- That's how you kiss your mother.
- Don't you say anything!

813
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:49,545
Make it real. You do that...

814
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:51,880
we'll do anything you want.

815
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:53,340
Anything?

816
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:54,842
Anything.

817
00:52:58,011 --> 00:53:00,806
- You better like it.
- Promise.

818
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:02,808
I wouldn't lie.

819
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,276
That is what I'm talking about.

820
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,237
Kev, you can look.

821
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:21,118
That's it.

822
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:22,995
Where's your tongue?

823
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,127
Good boys.

824
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:33,005
- Very good.
- Dude, you're a fucking lousy kisser.

825
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:35,048
What? I wasn't trying!

826
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:37,009
That's not fair!

827
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:39,094
I wasn't trying there!

828
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:40,888
No judgment.

829
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:43,765
Wait a second. You were trying?

830
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:46,310
- Fuck no!
- You were trying!

831
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:51,231
- I kissed Jim!
- Silence!

832
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,442
- Ladies.
- Yes?

833
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:55,611
As you were.

834
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:59,364
- Here we go.
- Let's do it.

835
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:17,174
Them girls sound like the two
transvestites we picked up in Biloxi.

836
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:19,801
- Honey, come on. Food's ready.
- I'm not hungry!

837
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,105
I can't believe this. Okay, just do it.

838
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:37,694
- Oh, God.
- It was worth it.

839
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:39,238
Hello.

840
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:58,632
Okay, I think that's enough now.

841
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:02,219
- I want more.
- Hell, yeah. I want more too, baby.

842
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:08,267
We're gonna get more physical
as soon as we get some...

843
00:55:09,685 --> 00:55:12,104
- Hand jobs.
- Okay!

844
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:15,315
Hand jobs.

845
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:20,529
You do him. We love to watch.

846
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,865
I'm sorry?

847
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:25,117
- You go.
- We go.

848
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:31,832
Don't be a wimp.

849
00:55:35,127 --> 00:55:37,588
Okay. It's okay.

850
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:39,548
I know what I have to do.

851
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:42,634
I need to keep this party goin'.

852
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:45,971
I'm takin' one for the team.

853
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:48,473
Mother of God!

854
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:50,142
Come on, you pussies! We had 'em!

855
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:52,895
- I am not touching that.
- Put that thing away, Stifler.

856
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:56,231
Why can't you guys be team players, huh?

857
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:58,233
I was the one doin'
all the sacrificing'.

858
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:06,325
And now for our devoted
listeners, back to the show.

859
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:10,662
<i>Let me try that dildo.</i>

860
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:14,958
<i>Now, wait just a minute.</i>

861
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:17,961
Stifler wanted to
give you two hand jobs?

862
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:21,882
No. Stifler wanted one from us.

863
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:23,884
What? Bullshit.

864
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:25,761
He did. And it was horrible.

865
00:56:25,844 --> 00:56:27,554
Very horrible.

866
00:56:27,638 --> 00:56:30,098
You guys, you wanna play some "asshole"?

867
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:32,851
Just watching the game, Kev.

868
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:35,020
I just wanna do something together.

869
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:39,399
We just did something
together. Very together.

870
00:56:39,483 --> 00:56:42,444
Ho, ho, ho. Stifler Claus is here.

871
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:45,405
Now, just so there's no confusion...

872
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:48,909
Santa Porn has just brought us
some heterosexual entertainment.

873
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:51,537
Here you go.

874
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:54,540
All right. Here.

875
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:57,376
And the Stifmeister's provided
us some complimentary lubricant.

876
00:56:57,459 --> 00:56:59,419
Whack away, Jim.

877
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,296
Does this stuff really
make a difference?

878
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,174
- Oh, yeah!
- Really?

879
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:12,307
Stifmeister's palace of love...

880
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:13,976
straight love.

881
00:57:15,144 --> 00:57:18,021
Oh, hey. Yeah, I'm fine.

882
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:19,815
- How about you?
- That's Stifler's mom.

883
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:21,316
Silence.

884
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,402
I didn't really think you were
gonna be in Michigan this summer.

885
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:25,487
Yeah, you're more than
welcome to be here.

886
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:28,991
Okay, stop by in a couple of
weeks. We're having a big party.

887
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:30,701
Okay, bye.

888
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:32,161
Stifler, was that...

889
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:37,291
She's coming.

890
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:44,089
Stifler's mom is coming here.

891
00:57:47,176 --> 00:57:49,219
Efforts must be doubled.

892
00:57:50,596 --> 00:57:52,598
"Efforts must be doubled. "

893
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:56,310
Absolutely.

894
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:05,694
Jenny, where'd you put my clarinet?

895
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:08,280
- I think I shoved it in your box.
- Thanks.

896
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:12,409
Bad man. I'm a bad, bad man.

897
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:18,248
Jim, what are you doing here?

898
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:20,792
Well, I thought you had said...

899
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:23,795
You can't just stand out here.

900
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:27,758
<i>Look, I need your help.</i>

901
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:31,970
Nadia's coming back and I don't...

902
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:34,139
I don't wanna be this awkward...

903
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:37,309
bumbling, nervous guy with her.

904
00:58:37,392 --> 00:58:38,977
I don't wanna seem like a dork.

905
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:41,271
Well, I know that feeling.

906
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:43,482
Spend your life playing in the band...

907
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:47,611
it doesn't exactly give you
the ultra-cool hipster image.

908
00:58:47,694 --> 00:58:51,365
- I think you're pretty cool.
- Seriously?

909
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:59,122
Michele, why did you
ditch me after prom?

910
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:03,210
I didn't ditch you. I just...

911
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:04,753
Our date was over.

912
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:07,881
I mean, did you want some...

913
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:10,551
funky, weird, next-morning goodbye?

914
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:15,973
It's not like I wanted you to pretend
you were in love with me or something.

915
00:59:16,056 --> 00:59:17,933
Why would I pretend that?

916
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:19,726
Guys do that.

917
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:24,690
Yeah, well, I'm not like other guys.

918
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:27,442
I know.

919
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:30,654
Okay, I'm gonna help you.

920
00:59:30,737 --> 00:59:32,656
Really?

921
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:35,450
Yeah, I feel bad for
saying that you sucked...

922
00:59:35,534 --> 00:59:38,579
even though you kind of did.

923
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,252
Let's just get started.

924
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:48,839
- Now, I'm a hot girl.
- Right.

925
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:51,842
- Okay, what do you wanna do?
- I wanna feel your boobs.

926
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:53,969
No, you dingbat.

927
00:59:54,052 --> 00:59:56,430
You don't just go groping away.

928
00:59:56,972 --> 01:00:00,184
You gotta preheat the oven
before you stick in the turkey.

929
01:00:03,729 --> 01:00:05,272
Kiss me, here.

930
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:13,530
Good. Okay, now...

931
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:15,157
the collarbone... kiss.

932
01:00:19,912 --> 01:00:22,498
Good, Jim.

933
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:24,082
You're making me wet.

934
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,542
Holy shit. Really?

935
01:00:25,626 --> 01:00:27,794
No, I was just saying
that so you could practice.

936
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,131
Of course.

937
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:56,281
Does direction matter, like
clockwise, counter clockwise?

938
01:00:56,365 --> 01:00:58,826
Okay, Jim, this is
what I'm talking about.

939
01:00:58,909 --> 01:01:03,205
Your main problem is you're so uptight.

940
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:07,876
Do I seem uptight about
my sexual stuff? No.

941
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,171
The biggest pointer
I could give you is...

942
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:15,801
you have to feel
comfortable in any situation.

943
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:17,261
Stand up.

944
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:19,096
Stand up.

945
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:24,184
- Now, this is a fucked-up situation.
- What happened to preheating?

946
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:26,895
- We're skipping a few chapters.
- Oh, okay.

947
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:30,732
This is good. This is good. Obviously.

948
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:35,612
- Gilligan's island, Mr Howell.
- What?

949
01:01:35,696 --> 01:01:39,575
You've got to control yourself
and think of something nonsexual.

950
01:01:39,658 --> 01:01:43,203
I haven't even touched you yet, and
you're turning into the Sears Tower.

951
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:46,165
I'm sorry. Yeah, nonsexual.

952
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:48,876
Right, right. Okay.

953
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:51,795
- Chairs.
- Good.

954
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:55,799
Mastodons.

955
01:01:58,468 --> 01:02:00,721
Cleaning my bathroom.

956
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:03,932
Dung beetles.

957
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,518
Okay. Now, don't freak out.

958
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:09,646
I'm gonna do something
to push your threshold.

959
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,565
Oh, that's cold! What are you doing?

960
01:02:12,232 --> 01:02:15,360
I just shoved a trumpet in your
ass. Aren't instruments fun?

961
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:18,906
Okay, I think you've
just crossed my threshold.

962
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:32,336
Call me in two weeks. I'll be
home then. We can finish lessons.

963
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:40,928
Pointer... less tongue.

964
01:02:59,571 --> 01:03:02,741
- What is it? A guest book?
- Yeah, and look at this entry.

965
01:03:02,825 --> 01:03:05,536
"Best thing was the
blow-out at Tom Myers' place.

966
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:08,038
- There he is.
- A night not soon to be forgotten.

967
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:10,749
August '93." It's your
brother, man. Look.

968
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:12,709
Yeah, his cottage was
right down on the beach.

969
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:16,380
Guys, this is what our party's gotta be.

970
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:19,216
- Something we'll always remember.
- Yes, definitely.

971
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:20,884
Absolutely.

972
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:25,138
- You go fish.
- Finch, we're playing gin.

973
01:03:29,143 --> 01:03:30,144
Gin.

974
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:23,071
What the fuck?

975
01:05:02,778 --> 01:05:03,737
"Dear Jim.

976
01:05:05,823 --> 01:05:09,576
Chicago is beautiful, but it
would be better if you were here.

977
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,538
I'm counting the days. Love, Nadia. "

978
01:05:15,457 --> 01:05:17,960
Well, I wish you were here, Nadia.

979
01:05:46,071 --> 01:05:49,616
<i>- Have you been dirty?
- Oh, yes, baby. I've been dirty.</i>

980
01:05:51,702 --> 01:05:53,620
<i>Do you want me to clean you?</i>

981
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:57,416
"Apply a few drops to
achieve desired lubrication. "

982
01:05:57,499 --> 01:05:59,209
All right.

983
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:06,884
<i>I that a loofah, or are
you just glad to see me?</i>

984
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:08,886
What the hell.

985
01:06:27,696 --> 01:06:29,490
Shit.

986
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,996
God!

987
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,165
I been missin' out.

988
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:58,352
Oh, shit!

989
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:05,651
Shit!

990
01:07:11,865 --> 01:07:14,618
- Everybody okay?
- I'm fine.

991
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:16,411
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

992
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:19,289
Shut the fuck up or I'll break
down this door and pummel your ass!

993
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:23,210
No, don't come in here. I'm
fine. I just fell out of the bed.

994
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:25,212
- You sure?
- Okay, good night, then.

995
01:07:25,295 --> 01:07:27,256
- 'Night.
- We'll see you in the morning.

996
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:42,604
Oh, shit!

997
01:08:07,796 --> 01:08:09,965
<i>- Poison control.
- Hello?</i>

998
01:08:14,595 --> 01:08:16,805
Yeah, I kind of...

999
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:18,724
Super Glued myself...

1000
01:08:18,807 --> 01:08:21,602
to myself.

1001
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:23,854
No, no!

1002
01:08:24,646 --> 01:08:26,607
Don't send an ambulance.

1003
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:30,777
Look, is there anything,
you know, around the house?

1004
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:36,366
Paint thinner.

1005
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:33,799
Shit.

1006
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:43,142
Don't move! Stay where you are!

1007
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:45,686
Hands where we can see 'em!

1008
01:09:45,769 --> 01:09:48,355
Both hands! Get the other
hand up, God damn it!

1009
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:52,317
I can't! I can't! I'm glued!

1010
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:54,361
I'm glued!

1011
01:09:54,945 --> 01:09:56,446
Sorry.

1012
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:59,449
Relax your hands.

1013
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:02,452
I'll take it from here, okay?

1014
01:10:02,536 --> 01:10:04,496
Don't worry, Jimbo. You're
gonna be fine, buddy.

1015
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:07,207
Jim, this happens to the best of us.

1016
01:10:12,296 --> 01:10:15,132
Left foot first. Easy does it. Good.

1017
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:18,886
- Watch your head.
- All right. Take a seat.

1018
01:10:20,846 --> 01:10:23,223
Excuse me, sir. Are you a family member?

1019
01:10:23,307 --> 01:10:25,851
Fuck, no! This is just too good to miss!

1020
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:28,812
Okay, sir, you're just gonna
have to wait here. All right?

1021
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:38,280
This summer's turned out to be great.

1022
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:57,257
Mucilage is dangerous territory...

1023
01:10:57,341 --> 01:11:01,929
and I would think any
adhesive product...

1024
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:04,973
would have a warning right on the tube.

1025
01:11:06,141 --> 01:11:10,229
I thought it was a lubricant.

1026
01:11:10,312 --> 01:11:12,981
I was trying to use lubricant.

1027
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:22,783
Son, couldn't you have left
that disgusting thing at home?

1028
01:11:24,243 --> 01:11:26,203
Excuse me?

1029
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:29,498
Well, that kind of
material is offensive to me.

1030
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:33,001
Oh, well, we're sorry.

1031
01:11:34,169 --> 01:11:37,130
But, you see, my son
couldn't leave it at home...

1032
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:40,467
because he's having a bit
of a medical emergency.

1033
01:11:40,551 --> 01:11:41,468
Thanks, Dad.

1034
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:44,888
Your opinion of his taste in
video rentals, I'm afraid...

1035
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:46,974
is not a priority, lady.

1036
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:51,228
It's at the bottom of the totem pole.

1037
01:11:53,856 --> 01:11:55,774
Thank you. Okay?

1038
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:57,818
My son...

1039
01:11:57,901 --> 01:11:59,903
is sitting here right now...

1040
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:02,698
with his hand glued to his penis!

1041
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:06,368
But that doesn't mean
anything to you, does it?

1042
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:08,745
Because you don't have a penis!

1043
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:10,747
- Or maybe you do!
- Dad!

1044
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:13,250
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1045
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:17,588
You know, it just bugs me when
people speak before they think.

1046
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,175
You know, they speak.

1047
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:29,183
- How you doin', son?
- I've been better.

1048
01:12:32,478 --> 01:12:35,063
Boy, that doesn't look too bad, Jim.

1049
01:12:35,147 --> 01:12:37,274
Good job, Doctor.

1050
01:12:37,357 --> 01:12:40,569
The swelling should subside
in about eight or nine days.

1051
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:42,279
Eight or nine...

1052
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,617
Beach party's in a week. Nadia's coming.

1053
01:12:50,621 --> 01:12:54,291
Doctor, my son has a
party in seven days...

1054
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:56,418
and there's a young lady coming...

1055
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:58,670
that he's been waiting to...

1056
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:02,799
he's been waiting to get with.

1057
01:13:02,883 --> 01:13:06,345
I'd tell your son to keep his
pants on during that party.

1058
01:13:06,428 --> 01:13:10,307
Oh, yes. Believe me, I will be
doing that. It goes without saying.

1059
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:12,976
But if his pants...

1060
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,229
decide to come off during the party...

1061
01:13:15,312 --> 01:13:18,398
could he have full use of his...

1062
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:22,152
penis?

1063
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:23,821
Okay.

1064
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,742
This should shave a couple of days off.

1065
01:13:28,826 --> 01:13:31,453
Oh, good.

1066
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:33,580
Thank you, Doctor.

1067
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:36,041
Jim...

1068
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:38,919
that's good news.

1069
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:42,589
This has been a good-news
day, son. Here. Put this on.

1070
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:44,216
Little chilly out there.

1071
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:48,720
Well, here we are.

1072
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:51,515
You know, Jim...

1073
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:55,310
I think we should keep your mother in
the dark about the incident tonight.

1074
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:58,772
I think the whole glue thing
might get her a little queasy.

1075
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:02,401
I don't know how I get
myself into these things.

1076
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:08,198
But thanks for understanding.

1077
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:10,909
You've been really cool.

1078
01:14:10,993 --> 01:14:13,036
I mean, between this and...

1079
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,872
you know...

1080
01:14:16,957 --> 01:14:21,003
You know, you may be Jimbo or Jumbo...

1081
01:14:21,086 --> 01:14:24,214
or Jimbodinny to these
guys in here, but...

1082
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:26,967
I want you to know
there are two people...

1083
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:30,512
who still remember where James
Emanuel Levenstein came from.

1084
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:35,559
We're awful proud of you, son.

1085
01:14:35,642 --> 01:14:37,478
Thanks, Dad.

1086
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:40,105
Don't forget your penis cream.

1087
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:02,711
That was it.

1088
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:06,715
Right there. That was
a pure tantric moment.

1089
01:15:06,798 --> 01:15:10,677
The fiicus, the water...
it was all erotic.

1090
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:15,557
One more stimulant, I
would have had full release.

1091
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:19,812
Finch, stay the fuck
away from that fiicus.

1092
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:21,563
That's a jizz-free fiicus.

1093
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:28,070
There he is. Morning, Jimbo. How's
the twig and giggleberries, man?

1094
01:15:28,153 --> 01:15:31,532
Oh, very colorful. My dick
looks like a paint-by-numbers.

1095
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,537
You're the only guy I know whose
dick needs an instruction manual.

1096
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,627
<i>Casa de Stifler.</i>

1097
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:50,843
You're here now? No, that's cool.

1098
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:53,554
You know, if you want to
hang out with these guys.

1099
01:15:53,637 --> 01:15:55,889
Okay, then. I'll meet you out front.

1100
01:15:58,976 --> 01:16:01,895
- Hey, Stifler, was that...
- Eat shit, Shitbreak.

1101
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:06,400
She's here.

1102
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:11,446
My lady has arrived.

1103
01:16:13,824 --> 01:16:16,535
- I gotta prepare.
- Here we go.

1104
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:19,788
- Great. Stifler's mom is here?
- This could be a disaster.

1105
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:25,669
Not unless Stifler's mom drives a moped.

1106
01:16:25,752 --> 01:16:26,795
Moped?

1107
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:33,844
Fuckers, fuckers, fuckers.
How you doin', boys?

1108
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:37,306
- That's Stifler's little brother.
- What are you doing here?

1109
01:16:37,389 --> 01:16:39,892
Pussy, man. I'm here for the pussy.

1110
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:41,768
Take a number.

1111
01:16:41,852 --> 01:16:45,397
Gentlemen, why all the noise?
Everybody knows this is my special day.

1112
01:16:45,481 --> 01:16:48,150
- What is that?
- Is that a fuckin' dress?

1113
01:16:48,233 --> 01:16:52,863
- Are you wearing a dress?
- Shitbreak, meet my little brother.

1114
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:54,698
Little brother, meet Shitbreak.

1115
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:58,118
- That's your brother?
- Yes.

1116
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:02,623
My lady's not coming.

1117
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:09,546
So my entire stockpile is wasted...

1118
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,965
and I look ridiculous!

1119
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:15,052
Excuse me.

1120
01:17:20,474 --> 01:17:22,851
- That didn't look too good.
- No.

1121
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:27,940
- Let's go find your room.
- So, where are the fuckin' females?

1122
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:33,320
I can't believe I finally got you alone.

1123
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:35,489
That only took, what, six weeks?

1124
01:17:36,657 --> 01:17:39,326
So, are you alone too?

1125
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:41,912
- Yep.
- Good.

1126
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:45,666
I'm all alone.

1127
01:17:45,749 --> 01:17:48,544
Guess what I had in mind?

1128
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:54,258
Hey, Marco, can you
get your balls off me?

1129
01:17:55,384 --> 01:17:59,179
- What the hell's going on over there?
- Nothing.

1130
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:01,515
It's just my flatmates.

1131
01:18:01,598 --> 01:18:03,433
I guess this is kind
of a lost cause, huh?

1132
01:18:03,517 --> 01:18:05,602
<i>- Yeah, I guess so.
- See ya this weekend?</i>

1133
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:07,771
- I can't wait.
- I can't wait either.

1134
01:18:07,855 --> 01:18:09,022
Bye-bye.

1135
01:18:13,944 --> 01:18:16,697
- Surprise!
- Holy... Nadia!

1136
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:20,200
You're here? You're here.
What are you doing here?

1137
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:22,244
Jim, I got so tired of sightseeing.

1138
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:24,663
But you're... you're early.

1139
01:18:24,746 --> 01:18:28,500
Okay. Nice to know you.

1140
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:31,211
- I will leave.
- No!

1141
01:18:31,295 --> 01:18:34,756
No. Don't... Don't leave.

1142
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,884
Don't leave. No leaving.

1143
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:44,266
It's just, I'm not gonna be ready...

1144
01:18:44,349 --> 01:18:48,437
I mean, the party won't
be ready until Saturday.

1145
01:18:50,022 --> 01:18:52,483
I can stay here until then?

1146
01:18:52,566 --> 01:18:54,151
Yeah.

1147
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:57,488
I'm gonna be right back. Is that okay?

1148
01:18:57,571 --> 01:19:00,157
- Okay.
- Nadia...

1149
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,744
who's in my room. Now. Holy shit.

1150
01:19:05,078 --> 01:19:07,122
<i>All right, I've got a plan.</i>

1151
01:19:07,206 --> 01:19:09,791
Okay. How about I come back with you...

1152
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:11,502
and you say...

1153
01:19:11,585 --> 01:19:13,837
"Hello, this is
Michele, my girlfriend. "

1154
01:19:13,921 --> 01:19:17,466
And obviously, Nadia won't
expect you to hop in the sack.

1155
01:19:17,549 --> 01:19:21,136
And then we break up
the day of the party.

1156
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:23,263
And you're all healed
and back on the market.

1157
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:27,226
- You're evil.
- No way!

1158
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:29,436
I'm like Cupid.

1159
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,022
And I know how to make a girl jealous.

1160
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:33,899
This is gonna be fun.

1161
01:19:34,191 --> 01:19:35,984
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner...

1162
01:19:36,068 --> 01:19:38,487
but we just started seeing
each other a few weeks ago.

1163
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:44,701
But I'd really love
it if you stayed here.

1164
01:19:44,785 --> 01:19:47,621
I think you should stay
and have fun at the party.

1165
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:51,291
Good for you, Jim.
Of course I will stay.

1166
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:54,336
That's great... That's my nipples!

1167
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:57,214
She just loves my nipples.

1168
01:21:31,308 --> 01:21:32,643
- Oh, my God.
- You still broken?

1169
01:21:33,519 --> 01:21:34,686
No.

1170
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,814
I'm fine.

1171
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:40,150
I might have to actually
go through with this.

1172
01:21:43,237 --> 01:21:45,989
What's the big deal with Nadia, anyway?

1173
01:21:46,073 --> 01:21:47,908
I mean, okay...

1174
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:51,703
so she's 50,000 times
hotter than most girls...

1175
01:21:51,787 --> 01:21:54,206
but come on, it's just sex.

1176
01:21:54,998 --> 01:21:56,166
Oh, no.

1177
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,544
You saw the thing on the Internet.

1178
01:21:58,627 --> 01:22:00,879
Did it look like I might have had...

1179
01:22:00,963 --> 01:22:03,632
a slight interest in Nadia then?

1180
01:22:05,384 --> 01:22:07,302
Add another year to that.

1181
01:22:07,386 --> 01:22:09,555
Okay.

1182
01:22:09,638 --> 01:22:13,183
Hey, why don't you bring
Nadia to the concert first?

1183
01:22:13,267 --> 01:22:15,102
It'll be a cool date.

1184
01:22:16,103 --> 01:22:18,021
We'll see how things go.

1185
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:26,905
Michele, you have been great.

1186
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:28,699
Thank you.

1187
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:30,409
Anytime.

1188
01:22:37,499 --> 01:22:39,293
Come on.

1189
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:44,548
You ready to break up?

1190
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:46,967
You big, stupid dummy!

1191
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:49,344
Theater is so cool!

1192
01:22:49,428 --> 01:22:52,806
I don't care if you are the best
lay I've ever had in my life.

1193
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:56,018
- I hate your guts anyway.
- Don't say that.

1194
01:22:56,101 --> 01:23:01,190
And I don't care if you did
give me ten orgasms in a row...

1195
01:23:01,273 --> 01:23:03,233
because you smell really bad.

1196
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:07,613
I smell really bad!

1197
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:11,241
Because we've been
having so much sex, and...

1198
01:23:11,325 --> 01:23:14,828
and I haven't showered,
and I wanna shower!

1199
01:23:16,413 --> 01:23:20,334
So, don't you go being all
super sexy guy any more...

1200
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:22,836
because I am now impervious...

1201
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,673
to your unrelenting
machismo and sexual ardor.

1202
01:23:27,591 --> 01:23:30,844
And that includes fucking
me in the ass! So there!

1203
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,646
We had something special.

1204
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:24,398
Vicki. Hey.

1205
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:27,860
I'm so glad you came. You
want something to drink or...

1206
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:29,778
Can I help you?

1207
01:24:31,196 --> 01:24:32,447
- Kevin.
- What?

1208
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:33,907
That's my date.

1209
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:51,758
You saved them all.

1210
01:24:51,842 --> 01:24:53,510
How sweet.

1211
01:24:54,595 --> 01:24:56,513
You don't think I'm a dork?

1212
01:24:59,349 --> 01:25:03,770
Whatever you are,
Jim, it is what I like.

1213
01:25:05,606 --> 01:25:07,608
Kevin left. Didn't look good.

1214
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:09,776
Kevin left?

1215
01:25:10,611 --> 01:25:12,279
Just wandered down the beach.

1216
01:25:16,492 --> 01:25:18,410
You okay, Kev?

1217
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:23,540
Wanna tell us what's up?

1218
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,461
Wanna feel Finch's ass?

1219
01:25:31,006 --> 01:25:34,426
No, I went to say hi to Vicky...

1220
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:37,304
and she was there with a date.

1221
01:25:37,387 --> 01:25:39,932
You hooked up with three girls
this year. You're doing fine.

1222
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:41,975
Rule of three, Oz.

1223
01:25:48,106 --> 01:25:50,901
I guess I was living in the past...
wanting to party with you guys...

1224
01:25:50,984 --> 01:25:53,529
and be with Vicky,
just like high school.

1225
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:56,114
You remember that day after prom?

1226
01:25:56,198 --> 01:25:58,992
You know, we made a
toast to the next step.

1227
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:02,913
I guess I never took it.

1228
01:26:05,123 --> 01:26:08,502
My brother said that by the end of
the summer I'd see the big picture.

1229
01:26:08,585 --> 01:26:10,587
And I see it.

1230
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:14,299
No matter what, times change
and things are different.

1231
01:26:14,383 --> 01:26:17,845
The problem is, I don't want them to be.

1232
01:26:17,928 --> 01:26:20,013
You know, Kevin, I
haven't moved on either.

1233
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:22,182
I've been obsessed with the one woman...

1234
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:24,476
I can't have a real future with...

1235
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,605
other than a very kinky,
extremely warped one.

1236
01:26:30,023 --> 01:26:32,359
I got to find a new goddess.

1237
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:37,239
It's gonna take patience, but
I've been celibate all summer.

1238
01:26:37,322 --> 01:26:41,410
- You kinda get used to it, though, huh?
- Are you insane?

1239
01:26:44,204 --> 01:26:48,375
Look, Kev, different does
not necessarily mean worse.

1240
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:51,336
As a matter of fact, I think
things are just getting better.

1241
01:26:51,837 --> 01:26:54,631
Or am I gonna have to drag your ass
back to that party and prove it to you?

1242
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:57,092
I'll walk.

1243
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:17,488
You know, you have beautiful eyes.

1244
01:27:17,571 --> 01:27:21,658
- Oh, you're sweet.
- That's a really nice top.

1245
01:27:21,742 --> 01:27:25,162
- Oh. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1246
01:27:25,245 --> 01:27:28,499
- Wanna fuck?
- Are you serious?

1247
01:27:28,582 --> 01:27:31,710
Come on, baby. Give
it to the Stifmeister.

1248
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:34,671
- I think you better...
- Your loss.

1249
01:27:34,755 --> 01:27:37,841
Wow. You know, you have beautiful eyes.

1250
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:41,512
Come here, dude. You're
making an ass out of yourself.

1251
01:27:41,595 --> 01:27:45,015
You're ruining my mojo. And
you're not the Stifmeister, okay?

1252
01:27:45,098 --> 01:27:47,476
It takes years to develop
true Stifmeister style.

1253
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:50,854
Come on, man! I just
wanna see some boobs.

1254
01:27:50,938 --> 01:27:52,731
- Hey, Pop Tart.
- Dream on, midget.

1255
01:27:52,815 --> 01:27:56,276
Excuse him. Come here. Take
this. You're on cop watch.

1256
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,238
Go out in the driveway.
See any cops, call me, okay?

1257
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:01,114
All right.

1258
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:15,170
Gentlemen, this appears to be a party.

1259
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:21,552
Guys, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go look for Nadia.

1260
01:28:21,635 --> 01:28:23,470
Good luck.

1261
01:28:26,932 --> 01:28:29,059
So what was this year like for you?

1262
01:28:29,143 --> 01:28:31,395
Did you miss high school?

1263
01:28:31,478 --> 01:28:33,480
Well, no.

1264
01:28:33,564 --> 01:28:37,234
When you travel as much as I
do, you get used to moving on.

1265
01:28:38,569 --> 01:28:40,988
But I have great memories.

1266
01:28:44,533 --> 01:28:47,619
- Wow, can we go in there?
- The lighthouse?

1267
01:28:50,831 --> 01:28:52,666
Yes.

1268
01:28:52,749 --> 01:28:54,501
Yes, we can.

1269
01:28:54,585 --> 01:28:56,503
How romantic.

1270
01:28:59,089 --> 01:29:00,424
Jim, come on.

1271
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:20,611
It's beautiful!

1272
01:29:20,694 --> 01:29:22,362
Cool!

1273
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:29,369
Jim, I have told you my
memories from high school.

1274
01:29:29,453 --> 01:29:31,205
What are yours?

1275
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:38,003
You.

1276
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:40,380
You have not changed.

1277
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:48,096
Jim, relax.

1278
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:52,559
We are just, how do you
say, tooting our horns.

1279
01:29:53,685 --> 01:29:55,646
Actually, that is quite difficult.

1280
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:56,939
What do you mean?

1281
01:29:57,815 --> 01:30:01,068
Well, this one time at band camp...

1282
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:08,617
Holy shit!

1283
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:12,079
What? Tell me.

1284
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:16,917
Well, this one time at band camp...

1285
01:30:18,085 --> 01:30:20,170
I got stuck playing this trombone.

1286
01:30:20,254 --> 01:30:23,423
And I can't play anything
at all. So I totally sucked.

1287
01:30:23,507 --> 01:30:25,467
And everyone thought
I was this Petey guy...

1288
01:30:25,551 --> 01:30:28,220
but I didn't know what to think, so
I just kept playing and playing...

1289
01:30:28,303 --> 01:30:30,389
and I didn't know what I was doing.

1290
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:32,266
It was so funny!

1291
01:30:33,767 --> 01:30:36,854
- I gotta go.
- What? Why?

1292
01:30:39,731 --> 01:30:41,650
Please don't take this the wrong way...

1293
01:30:41,733 --> 01:30:44,194
but you're...

1294
01:30:44,278 --> 01:30:47,364
you're everything that I used to want.

1295
01:30:47,447 --> 01:30:50,534
And as much as I may really...

1296
01:30:50,617 --> 01:30:54,329
really regret what I'm about to do...

1297
01:30:55,789 --> 01:30:57,708
there's somebody else I want to be with.

1298
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:00,836
You want the band geek?

1299
01:31:00,919 --> 01:31:02,129
Nadia...

1300
01:31:03,172 --> 01:31:05,132
I am a band geek.

1301
01:31:06,508 --> 01:31:09,303
I just never joined the band.

1302
01:31:14,057 --> 01:31:15,976
You go get your geek.

1303
01:31:17,644 --> 01:31:19,480
Someday I will find mine.

1304
01:31:38,332 --> 01:31:41,627
Hey. Kevin Myers.

1305
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:43,921
Hi. Sorry I was a dick before.

1306
01:31:44,004 --> 01:31:46,840
It's okay, man. My name's Brett.

1307
01:31:46,924 --> 01:31:49,760
- Can you give us a sec?
- Sure.

1308
01:31:51,178 --> 01:31:53,347
Look, you don't have to do this.

1309
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:55,933
Maybe I was being selfish...

1310
01:31:56,016 --> 01:31:59,436
in wanting to be your friend.

1311
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,189
Maybe it's just not gonna work.

1312
01:32:02,272 --> 01:32:05,859
I would much rather have you as a friend
than not have you in my life at all.

1313
01:32:19,206 --> 01:32:21,166
Party on!

1314
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:30,300
- From the lighthouse all the way...
- Hey, handsome.

1315
01:32:37,349 --> 01:32:38,934
What are you doing here?

1316
01:32:39,017 --> 01:32:41,395
I was gonna pick you up at
the airport in two hours.

1317
01:32:41,478 --> 01:32:43,772
I took an earlier flight, and
I thought I'd surprise you.

1318
01:32:43,856 --> 01:32:47,734
- Yeah, you did.
- Kinda weird without the phone, huh?

1319
01:32:47,818 --> 01:32:50,070
We'll get used to it.

1320
01:32:50,154 --> 01:32:53,490
Come on. I wanna hear all about
it. We'll grab you a drink.

1321
01:32:54,408 --> 01:32:57,119
Steve, this cop-watch
thing is horseshit.

1322
01:32:57,202 --> 01:32:58,662
Hello?

1323
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:03,000
Man, this sucks.

1324
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:04,918
<i>Who is it out there?</i>

1325
01:33:08,088 --> 01:33:10,757
It's the Stifmeister, baby.

1326
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:12,468
<i>Is that so?</i>

1327
01:33:17,097 --> 01:33:19,475
Life's a bitch, isn't it?

1328
01:33:21,727 --> 01:33:25,022
It's all right. You don't
have to say anything.

1329
01:33:25,105 --> 01:33:27,524
I'm used to girls ignoring me.

1330
01:33:27,608 --> 01:33:29,526
Or making fun of me.

1331
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:31,695
"Come on, Sherman. Be the Sherminator. "

1332
01:33:33,363 --> 01:33:36,408
Like the movie. How clever.

1333
01:33:36,492 --> 01:33:38,452
I get it, okay?

1334
01:33:40,204 --> 01:33:41,663
Maybe I am a geek.

1335
01:33:41,747 --> 01:33:44,291
Whatever.

1336
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:49,463
Yes! Yes, you are!

1337
01:33:51,965 --> 01:33:53,550
All right.

1338
01:33:55,719 --> 01:33:59,431
I am the Sherminator.

1339
01:33:59,515 --> 01:34:03,018
A sophisticated sex robot
sent back through time...

1340
01:34:03,101 --> 01:34:05,646
to change the future for one lucky lady.

1341
01:34:06,605 --> 01:34:08,607
I am lucky lady?

1342
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:10,692
That's right, Nadia.

1343
01:34:10,776 --> 01:34:13,445
You've been targeted for Shermination.

1344
01:34:13,529 --> 01:34:16,198
Come with me if you want to live.

1345
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:20,536
Help!

1346
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:27,334
- Fuck me, geek!
- Affirmative!

1347
01:34:27,417 --> 01:34:29,878
No fuckin' way!

1348
01:34:36,093 --> 01:34:39,304
- Forget it.
- Like you have a chance.

1349
01:34:54,611 --> 01:34:56,363
Cheers, bud.

1350
01:35:02,077 --> 01:35:05,038
Hey, Steve, look what I found.

1351
01:35:05,122 --> 01:35:07,624
- Dude, don't touch the shirt.
- Just look.

1352
01:35:10,627 --> 01:35:11,587
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

1353
01:35:12,045 --> 01:35:14,882
Brilliant. You found lesbians.

1354
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:18,886
Good luck trying to break
through that force field.

1355
01:35:18,969 --> 01:35:22,306
- Lesbians?
- We never said that.

1356
01:35:28,353 --> 01:35:30,939
- What?
- We never said that.

1357
01:35:34,568 --> 01:35:36,278
Oh, man.

1358
01:35:37,362 --> 01:35:41,241
I will do anything... anything...
to sleep with you chicks.

1359
01:35:41,325 --> 01:35:45,787
Okay? I'll grab every
guy's ass in this room.

1360
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:49,041
I'll caress it, even. I'll
shave some ass if they need it.

1361
01:35:49,124 --> 01:35:51,376
Oh, yeah. You heard me.

1362
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:56,507
It's true. I'll kiss everybody
here. Dudes, chicks, everybody.

1363
01:35:56,590 --> 01:36:00,344
Because I am comfortable
with my sexuality.

1364
01:36:00,427 --> 01:36:01,762
Oh, yeah.

1365
01:36:03,806 --> 01:36:06,308
At least have a drink
with the Stifmeister.

1366
01:36:07,768 --> 01:36:09,686
- All right.
- That's fair.

1367
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,106
All right.

1368
01:36:15,651 --> 01:36:17,986
You truly are a Stifmeister.

1369
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:22,199
- Welcome back to the party.
- Steve, those are my lesbians.

1370
01:36:22,282 --> 01:36:25,118
- Ladies, I am down with the funky shit.
- Like what?

1371
01:36:25,202 --> 01:36:27,538
One time at this party,
I was drinking champagne...

1372
01:36:30,666 --> 01:36:32,334
Thank you. Thank you.

1373
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:35,796
Our next soloist will
be Michele Flaherty.

1374
01:37:04,658 --> 01:37:06,493
Petey?

1375
01:37:10,914 --> 01:37:13,167
This kid is killing me.

1376
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:17,671
- You suck, retard.
- I'm not retarded.

1377
01:37:18,964 --> 01:37:21,049
I'm a very special boy.

1378
01:37:37,566 --> 01:37:39,610
How's this for a band camp story?

1379
01:37:50,871 --> 01:37:54,541
Come on, guys. Let's hear it for Petey!

1380
01:38:22,986 --> 01:38:25,280
That untalented bastard.

1381
01:39:06,822 --> 01:39:09,032
- Good for them.
- It's awesome.

1382
01:39:12,578 --> 01:39:15,164
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

1383
01:39:15,247 --> 01:39:18,125
We'll be back. Come on now, baby.

1384
01:40:02,377 --> 01:40:05,339
You know, there's only
one word for that party.

1385
01:40:05,631 --> 01:40:07,883
- Bitchin'.
- Out of control.

1386
01:40:09,551 --> 01:40:11,762
Am I gonna have a
hangover? 'Cause I want one.

1387
01:40:19,311 --> 01:40:20,521
Later.

1388
01:40:21,563 --> 01:40:23,232
- Good-bye.
- See ya.

1389
01:40:23,315 --> 01:40:26,360
- Let's go to our page.
- We have to write about this party.

1390
01:40:26,443 --> 01:40:29,321
This party was crazy! Look
at my date! He's passed out!

1391
01:40:29,404 --> 01:40:31,865
- You drank him under the table.
- He couldn't hack it.

1392
01:41:10,904 --> 01:41:14,199
- Best summer ever, huh, fellas?
- Absolutely.

1393
01:41:14,283 --> 01:41:18,412
- Sorry things didn't work out for you.
- You kiddin'? Things are great.

1394
01:41:18,787 --> 01:41:21,039
I have all the time in the world.

1395
01:41:21,123 --> 01:41:23,208
So, are we gonna do this every summer?

1396
01:41:23,292 --> 01:41:25,627
- Hell, yeah, we are.
- Of course we are, gentlemen.

1397
01:41:25,711 --> 01:41:27,296
Well, we're gonna try.

1398
01:41:38,682 --> 01:41:41,560
- That's a sweet car.
- It is sweet.

1399
01:41:47,524 --> 01:41:49,860
- Stifler's mom.
- Hey, Finchy.

1400
01:41:49,943 --> 01:41:51,904
How did you know I was here?

1401
01:41:51,987 --> 01:41:54,198
I called a couple of weeks ago.

1402
01:41:54,281 --> 01:41:56,742
Didn't Steven tell you that
I was gonna drop by sometime?

1403
01:41:56,825 --> 01:41:59,620
I guess it slipped his mind.

1404
01:42:01,371 --> 01:42:03,081
What's your name?

1405
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:06,460
Jeanine.

1406
01:42:09,463 --> 01:42:11,715
Okay, well...

1407
01:42:11,799 --> 01:42:15,052
I've been thinking, and,
you know, I'm 19 years old.

1408
01:42:15,135 --> 01:42:19,264
There's a whole world out there.
I can't be obsessed with one woman.

1409
01:42:19,348 --> 01:42:23,143
- Just can't be.
- I'm glad you're learning, Finchy.

1410
01:42:24,645 --> 01:42:26,438
Good.

1411
01:42:29,608 --> 01:42:33,487
- You want to get it on?
- You better clear your schedule.

1412
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:38,992
See you guys later.

1413
01:42:39,076 --> 01:42:41,119
Where are you goin',
man? What about Dog Years?

1414
01:42:41,203 --> 01:42:44,998
Give me, like, three days.

1415
01:42:46,917 --> 01:42:49,169
Wait, was that who I think...

1416
01:42:49,253 --> 01:42:51,630
- No.
- Yeah!

1417
01:42:51,713 --> 01:42:54,299
- I think it was.
- I think so too.

1418
01:42:57,344 --> 01:42:59,263
Who the hell was that?

1419
01:42:59,346 --> 01:43:00,848
That was...

1420
01:43:00,931 --> 01:43:02,599
That was... Someone was lost.

1421
01:43:02,683 --> 01:43:06,812
- Lookin' for the lake.
- Yeah, all turned around.

1422
01:43:06,895 --> 01:43:10,107
What a dumb ass. The lake's right there.

1423
01:43:15,696 --> 01:43:19,449
Incredible. How does Finch get so lucky?

1424
01:43:19,533 --> 01:43:21,535
What are you worried about?
You got a girlfriend now.

1425
01:43:21,869 --> 01:43:24,788
Everything in. Let's go.
Pony up. Dog Years awaits.

1426
01:43:24,872 --> 01:43:27,958
Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do.

1427
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:30,127
- I have a girlfriend now.
- Yeah, you do.

1428
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:32,671
- She's my girlfriend.
- All right, Jimbo.

1429
01:43:32,754 --> 01:43:34,631
Let's go! Let's go!

1430
01:43:34,715 --> 01:43:36,091
- Where's Shitbreak?
- The movies.

1431
01:43:36,175 --> 01:43:37,926
- Took the bus.
- Coffee.

1432
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:40,137
Wait a second.

1433
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:42,556
Who the fuck was in that car?

1434
01:43:49,438 --> 01:43:51,565
Oh, Finchy, I missed you.

1435
01:43:53,108 --> 01:43:56,320
Oh, Jeanine. Jeanine.

1436
01:43:56,403 --> 01:43:58,238
Call me Stifler's mom.

1437
01:44:00,407 --> 01:44:03,410
Oh, Stifler's mom!

1438
01:44:04,305 --> 01:45:04,431
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
