[chuckles]
[nickers]

168
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,253
Hey, Altivo! Ah-ta-ta, not for you!

169
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,215
You're on half rations.
Orders from Cortes.

170

[gasps]
[banging]

[banging continues]

172
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:22,230
So, uh, how's the...
How's the escape plan coming?

173
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,067
All right. All right. Wait!

174
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,569
I'm getting something.
Yeah.

175
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:34,533
Okay!

176
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:36,535
Here's the plan.

177
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,664
In the dead of night,
you and I grab some provisions...
Mm-hm.

178
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,749
...hijack one of those longboats,

179
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:46,003
and then we row back to Spain
like there's no <i>mañana!</i>

180
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,423
Back to Spain, yeah?
Yeah.

181
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:51,467
In a rowboat.
You got it!

182
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,595
Great. Sensational.
And that's your plan, is it?

183
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,055
That's pretty much it.

184
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:57,932
Well, I like it.

185
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,933
So, how do we get on deck?

186
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:00,184
Hmm.

187
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:04,939
In the dead of night,
you and I grab some provisions,

188
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:08,359
hijack one of those longboats--
Uh, great.

189
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,278
Okay, what's your idea, smart guy?

190
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:11,946
Wh-- What do you mean? Don't ask me that!

191
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,114
You're the one with the plans.

192
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,367
[horse whinnying]
Wait, I-- I have an idea.

193
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,327
Uh, come on. Give me-- Give me a boost.

194
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,330
[whispering] Hey, Altivo.

195
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,624
Altivo.

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,460
You want a nice apple? Come and get it.

197
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:30,548
[hooves clattering]
You have to do a trick for me first.

198
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,341
[sputtering]

199
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:35,386
All you have to do is find a pry bar.

200
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:39,974
A long piece of iron with a hooky thing
at the end. Yeah?

201
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,643
Miguel, you're talking to a horse!

202
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:43,894
- [shushes]
- [hooves clattering]

203
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:46,981
That's it, Altivo, find the pry bar.

204
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:49,191
[Tulio] Yes, find the pry bar.
[Altivo whinnying]

205
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:52,737
He can't understand "pry bar."
[clattering continues]

206
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,072
He's a dumb horse. There's no way--

207
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:58,534
[Altivo whinnying]

208
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:03,289
Well... it's not a pry bar.

209
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,751

00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:23,059
Oh, Altivo. Oh, thank you, old boy.

212
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:26,354
Listen, if we can ever return the favor...

213
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,359
For Pete's sake, Miguel,
he's a ruthless warhorse, not a poodle.

214
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,527
Come on, before he licks you to death.

215
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:34,528
<i>Adiós.</i>

[whinnies]

217
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,410
Shh, shh. Quiet, please.
Shh.

218
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,163
What's the matter with him?
Oh, he wants his apple.

219
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,207
Well, give it to him before
he wakes up the whole ship!

220
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,500
[bellowing]

221
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,211

226
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:06,811

00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,237
Altivo, I'm coming!
Miguel!

231
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,989
Just hang on! I'm right here, old boy!

232
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,491
Have you lost your mind?

233
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,742
Help is coming!

234
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,119
[gasps]

235
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,247
Holy ship!

00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:27,748
[both] Whoa!

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,838
[all gasping]

238
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,091
Loop the rope under the horse!

239
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:38,092
Yes!

240
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,852
On the count of three,
pull back on the rope!

241
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,937
- What? [gasps]
- Three!

242
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,940
[Tulio] Pull!
[grunting]

243
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,491
Tulio! Hey, it worked!

244
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,165
Did any of the supplies make it?

245
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:12,585
Well, uh, yes and no.
[crunching sound]

246
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:17,882
Oh, great!

247
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,801
Tulio. Look on the positive side.
At least things can't get--

248
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:21,677
[thunder crashes]

249
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,805
Excuse me. Were you going to say "worse"?

250
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,224
No. No.
No? You're sure?

251
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,935
Absolutely not.
I've revised the whole thing.
Okay, because--

252
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:31,687
[Tulio] Yeah,
we're at least in a rowboat.

253
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,105
We're in a rowboat, exactly.

254
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:34,148
You miss nothing.

255
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:41,614

[all sobbing]

263
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:32,373
Tulio, did you ever imagine
it would end like this?

264
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,710
The horse is a surprise.
[nickers]

265
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,922
Any... regrets?

266
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,676
Besides dying? Yeah.

267
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:49,723
I never... had enough... gold.

268
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:55,813
My regret, besides dying, is...

269
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:00,484
our greatest adventure
is over before it began,

270
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,736
and no one will even remember us.

271
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,073
Well, if it's any consolation, Miguel,

272
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,869
you... made my life...

273
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,622
an adventure. [sobbing]

274
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,917
And if it's any consolation, Tulio,
[sniffles]

275
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:21,338
you made my life... rich.

[gasps] Is it?
Hmm. [gasps]

00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,903
It is! It's... [stammers]

All in favor of getting back
in the boat, say "aye."
Aye!

Aye! Go!

00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,312
Hey, Miguel! I could use a little help!

288
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,981
Miguel!

289
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,151
Hello!
Tulio! We've done it!

290
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,819
What's that? The map?

291
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,696
It's all right here!

292
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,574
You still have the map?

293
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:32,534
The whistling rock! The stream!

294
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,788
You kept the map,
but you couldn't grab a little more food?

295
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,207
Even those mountains.
You said so yourself:

296
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,502
It could be possible. And it is!

297
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:45,422
It really is the map to El Dorado!

298
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,132
[panting]

299
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,510
You drank seawater, didn't you?

300
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:50,761
Oh, come on!

301
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,304
I'm not coming on!

302
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:55,933
I wouldn't set foot in that jungle
for a million <i>pesetas!</i>

303
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,353
How about a 100 million?

304
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,813
What?

305
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,525
I just thought that, after all,
since El Dorado is the city of gold--

306
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:05,609
What's your point?

307
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:07,695
You know, dust, nuggets, bricks,

308
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,614
a temple of gold where you can pluck gold
from the very walls.

309
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:12,574
But you don't want to go, so

310
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,285
let's get back into the boat
and row back to Spain.

311
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,954
After all, it worked so well last time.

312
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,122
[gibberish] Wait!

313
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,750
Mmm. Wait a minute. New plan.

314
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:27,172
We find the city of gold.
We take the gold,

315
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,133
and then we go back to Spain.

316
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,467
And buy Spain!

317
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,428
Yeah!
That's the spirit!

318
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:36,306
Come on, Tulio. We'll follow that trail!

319
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:37,891
What trail?

320
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:41,270
The trail that we blaze!

321
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,440
[nickers]

322
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,444

Oh, no, you don't.

326
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:59,288

Of course. I should probably consult
with Lord Miguel.

974
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:50,710
This is fairly important stuff.
I, um, should discuss the entire, uh,

975
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:54,256
blood issue right away.

976
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:55,841
Excuse us, won't you? Let's go.

977
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,555
[chuckles] Finally... we're connecting.

978
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:05,141
[horse whinnies]

[nickering]

980
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:13,817
This way.

981
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:16,778
[chief laughing]

[grunts]

984
00:53:21,992 --> 00:53:24,160
What do you think you're doing?

985
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:26,288
[chuckles] Lying low.

986
00:53:26,496 --> 00:53:28,790
[grunts] Look, change of plans.

987
00:53:28,874 --> 00:53:31,418
We have to grab what we can carry
and get out of here now!

988
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:32,794
What? Why?

989
00:53:32,878 --> 00:53:35,463
Because the high priest is nuts!
He wants--

990
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:36,548
This is unacceptable!

991
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:38,049
Yeah. Yeah. Like he said.

992
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:41,595
The gods should not be playing ball
like this!

993
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:42,721
Well, exactly!

994
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:46,474
This is how the gods should play ball!

995
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:50,353
- [cheering]
- [horn sounding]

996
00:53:50,437 --> 00:53:53,064
Well, don't blame me.
I blame you.

997
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:54,649
[cheering]

998
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:58,111
What is the object of this game,
pray tell?

999
00:53:58,528 --> 00:54:00,238
You've gotta knock the ball
through the hoop.

1000
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:02,324
What hoop?
That hoop.

1001
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:05,243
[eagle cries]
That's impossible.

1002
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:06,077
We're gonna lose.

1003
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:07,913
Gods don't lose.

1004

[men] Heep-ha!

1006
00:54:13,919 --> 00:54:17,422
My lords, Chief Tannabok's warriors
are the finest ballplayers in the city.

1007
00:54:17,547 --> 00:54:21,885
[grunting, gargling]
Fifteen mere mortals against two gods.

1008
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:23,470
[both gulp]

1009
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:25,180
I realize it's a bit uneven,
[warriors] Heep-ha!

1010
00:54:26,056 --> 00:54:28,892
but I do hope they'll challenge you enough
to make the game... interesting.

1011
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:31,227
Play ball!

1012
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:32,938
[crowd cheering]

1013
00:54:35,023 --> 00:54:37,525
Crush them into the dust. [chuckles]

1014
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:39,277
Enjoy.
[crowd chanting] Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

[all grunting with each bounce]

1019
00:54:54,042 --> 00:54:55,543
My lords,

1020
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:58,630
were you not supposed
to put the ball into play?

1021
00:54:58,922 --> 00:55:00,256
Oh!

1022
00:55:00,674 --> 00:55:03,051
[chuckles] Well, no, no, no.

1023
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:08,306
We were merely demonstrating the, um,
traditional, uh, first avoidance maneuver.

1024
00:55:09,516 --> 00:55:10,642
Ah.

1025
00:55:11,518 --> 00:55:13,103
I've never heard of such a thing.

1026
00:55:14,187 --> 00:55:15,981
Excuse me.

1027
00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:18,775
Who invented this game?

1028
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:22,779
[chuckles] Why, the gods, of course.
[chuckles]

1029
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:26,741
I'm warning you,
don't push your luck with this guy.

1030
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,953
But, Tulio, we're the gods.

[groans]
Ah!

1035
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:44,759

Excuse me.

How long does this go on anyway?

1052
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:26,217
The game is over
when the shadow touches this line.

1053
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:29,512
We need a miracle.
No, we need to cheat.

Yes! [laughs]

Who's the god?
You the god.

1071
00:57:18,228 --> 00:57:20,188
No, you the god.
No, you the god.

1072
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:21,064
Fine.

1073

Yes! Yes!

00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:19,205
My lords, congratulations on your victory.

1087
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:22,333
And now, you will, of course,
wish to have the losing team

1088
00:58:22,417 --> 00:58:24,752
- sacrificed to your glory.
- [crowd gasping]

1089

Not again.

Look, Tzekel-Kan,
Uh, Miguel?

1091
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:33,761
forget the sacrifices.
Miguel.

1092
00:58:33,845 --> 00:58:35,930
We don't want any sacrifices.

1093
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:41,394
But all of the sacred writings
say that you will devour
the wicked and the unrighteous.

1094
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:44,022
Well, I don't see anyone here
who fits that description.

[scoffs]

Well, as speaker for the gods,

1097
00:58:47,901 --> 00:58:51,779
it would be my privilege
to point them out.

1098
00:58:51,863 --> 00:58:55,116
The gods are speaking for themselves now!

1099
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,787
This city and these people
have no need for you anymore!

[grunts]

1101
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:03,708
There will be no sacrifices!

As the

gods... command.

- [laughing]

Whoa! Whoa!

1112
00:59:35,907 --> 00:59:39,827
Hey, not bad
for my first commandment, huh? [laughs]

1113
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:41,955
Miguel, the little voice... [stammers]

1114
00:59:42,038 --> 00:59:43,498
Yeah, fine.

1115
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:50,588
Do you know why the gods demand blood?

1116
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:52,173
I don't know.

1117

[grunts]

1118
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:56,928
Because gods don't bleed.

1119
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:04,269
It's time to take the future
into my own hands,

1120
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:06,646
and this city will be cleansed.

1121
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:08,690
Even if I have to do it myself.

1122
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:11,693
- Uh, how?
- [grunts]

1123
01:00:12,902 --> 01:00:14,862
There are dark magics here,

1124
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:18,366
and power, and...

1125
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:20,910
Ooh. My, my, my.

1126
01:00:21,911 --> 01:00:24,956
It's not called the Age of the Jaguar
for nothing.

[snickering]

1128
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:34,299
This'll be a delightful way
to bid the false gods... goodbye.

[workers shouting]

1136
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:09,584
Well, it's, um, uh, nice.

1137
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:10,501
Nice?

1138
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:12,003
Yes, nice.
But?

1139
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:16,883
Um, but, uh, is it really fit
for the gods?

1140
01:01:16,966 --> 01:01:18,593
My lord.
[chuckles]

1141
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:22,805
I have been around boats, believe me,

1142
01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:26,392
and that, um... The pointy, tall, um...

1143
01:01:26,476 --> 01:01:28,853
[stammering] The long up-and-down thing--

1144
01:01:28,978 --> 01:01:32,106
The mast?
The mast, yes, yes. The mast is good.

1145
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:35,443
Well, look at it. [stammering]
There's not nearly enough, uh,

1146
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:37,612
um, rope.

1147
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:38,529
Rope?

1148
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:40,865
Yes, rope. Exactly my point.

1149
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:44,535
Vertical ascension requires
a lot more, uh, rope.

1150
01:01:44,786 --> 01:01:46,120
My lord. [chuckles]

1151
01:01:46,204 --> 01:01:49,123
And look at this. [grunting]

1152
01:01:49,207 --> 01:01:50,750
[sighs, clears throat]

1153
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,293
This doesn't look at all secure.

1154
01:01:52,377 --> 01:01:56,589
Chief, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but all in all, it is a complete do-over.

1155
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:03,679
Hmm.

1156
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,225
You know, Lord Miguel,

1157
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:10,103
if you wish to stay,

1158
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:13,064
you only need to say so.

1159
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:16,067
You mean, forever?

1160
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:18,069
Of course.

1161
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:25,159
Oh, no, I can't.
I have to go back with Tulio.

1162
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:27,245
We're... We're partners.

1163
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,415
Big plans in the other world, huh?

1164
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:34,252
Yep. Big plans.

1165
01:02:34,919 --> 01:02:39,340
Well, then, I better
go get some more rope, huh?

1166
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:41,843
Oh, Chief, um, forget about the rope.

1167
01:02:42,385 --> 01:02:44,345
Um, my mistake.

1168
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:46,973
Hey, to err is human.

1169
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:01,654
[Tulio] Half?

1170
01:03:03,281 --> 01:03:04,031
Mm-hmm.

1171
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:06,826
[laughing] I don't think so.

1172
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:07,910
I'll tell you what.

1173
01:03:08,244 --> 01:03:10,538
Uh, I'll let you come back
to Spain with us,

1174
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:15,126
like you wanted, and, um, yeah,
I can see my way clear to throwing you,

1175
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:16,961
mmm, ten percent?

1176
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:21,132
[chuckles] You know, maybe I won't go
to Spain with you and take a third.

1177
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:23,718
Oh! [chuckling]

1178
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,386
Like you don't wanna go to Spain.

1179
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:28,264
Oh, like you don't want me
to want to go to Spain.

1180
01:03:28,556 --> 01:03:30,558
I want you to want...
Mm-hmm?

1181
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:32,643
...what you want.

1182
01:03:33,561 --> 01:03:35,062
Mm-hmm. Go on.

1183
01:03:35,855 --> 01:03:38,649
All right. Cards on the table.

1184
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:42,445
Uh, I want you to come to Spain
with me and Miguel.

1185
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:45,281
Mostly me. Especially me.

1186
01:03:45,907 --> 01:03:47,658
Only me. Forget Miguel.

1187
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:49,577
[laughs] Well...

1188
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:52,580
as long as that's what you want.

1189
01:03:53,706 --> 01:03:55,541
Me, too.
Okay.

1190
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:57,502
Deal?

1191
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:00,922
Deal. Mmm.

1195
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:11,849
Well, forget Tulio.

Well, is it ready yet?

1199
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:38,834
Ooh.

1200
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:44,090
Ah! [sniffing]

1201
01:04:44,173 --> 01:04:46,467
Ah! Hmm.

1202
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:49,387
It seems to be missing something.

1203
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:53,307
Ah, that's it.

1204
01:04:55,226 --> 01:04:57,979
It needs more... body.

than you do.

[sighs] Some send-off, huh?

1218

We're finally at the "Go back to Spain
and live like kings" part.

Well, isn't king kind of
a step down from god?

1223
01:06:10,468 --> 01:06:12,845
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1224

Miguel, we can't stay here.

1225
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:17,308
We have a plan, remember?

1226
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:23,147
How about we forget the plan? Hmm?

1227
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:26,275
What?

I know what you are...

01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:40,743
and I know what you are not!

1269

And you are not gods!

Hey, it was his stupid plan!

01:09:00,012 --> 01:09:01,055
- What?
- Oh, oh, oh.

1275
01:09:01,138 --> 01:09:04,308
My plan was that we should lie low!

1276
01:09:04,725 --> 01:09:07,561
But your plan was to run off and be all

1277
01:09:07,645 --> 01:09:09,980
"Oh, look at me. Look at me. I'm a god."

1278

That's not true!

No? Who are you kidding?

1280
01:09:12,942 --> 01:09:14,735
You're buying your own con!

1281
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:16,737
At least I'm not dating mine.

1282

I-- Ooh, low blow.

1283

Listen, Mr. High and Mighty,

1284
01:09:21,492 --> 01:09:24,662
we'd both be sailing out of here
with a mountain of gold

1285
01:09:24,787 --> 01:09:26,747
if you had just listened to me!
[grunts]

1286
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:30,501
Well, now you've got all
the precious gold and Chel.

1287
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:31,877
So what do you need me for?

1288
01:09:31,961 --> 01:09:34,713
Well, maybe I don't need you anymore.

1289
01:09:34,797 --> 01:09:37,883
Well, then, why don't you
just go back to Spain, and I'll stay here,

1290
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:39,927
and we'll both get what we want!

1291

That's... fine with me, pal!

1292
01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:43,305
- Fine with me, too!
- Ooh.

1293
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:44,682
- Fine!
- Ouch.

1294
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:46,016
- Okay!
- [evil chuckling]

1295
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:46,976
[both] All right!

1296
01:09:48,686 --> 01:09:49,436
