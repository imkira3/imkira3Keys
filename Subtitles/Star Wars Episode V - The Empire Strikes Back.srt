1
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:35,498
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:37,634
Han, old buddy,
do you read me?

3
00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:39,804
<i>Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?</i>

4
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:42,625
Well, I finished my circle.
I don't pick up any life readings.

5
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:45,681
<i>There isn't enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser.</i>

6
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:47,551
<i>The sensors are placed.
I'm going back.</i>

7
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,557
Right. I'll see you shortly.

8
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:51,777
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

9
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:54,117
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

10
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:55,235
Steady.

11
00:03:56,608 --> 00:04:00,001
Steady, girl. What's the matter?
You smell something?

12
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:42,943
Chewie. Chewie?

13
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:51,178
All right.
Don't lose your temper.

14
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:53,729
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

15
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,317
Solo.

16
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,269
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.

17
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,190
- You'll know if anything comes around.
- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

18
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,108
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

19
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:27,742
With all the meteor activity, it's gonna
be difficult to spot approaching ships.

20
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:29,744
General, I gotta leave.
I can't stay any more.

21
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,745
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- There's a price on my head.

22
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,184
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,
I'm a dead man.

23
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,123
A death mark's not
an easy thing to live with.

24
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,244
You're a good fighter, Solo.
I hate to lose you.

25
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,737
Thank you, General.

26
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,853
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

27
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:54,816
That's right.

28
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,128
Don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

29
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,291
Han.

30
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,244
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- I thought you had decided to stay.

31
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:12,202
The bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

32
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,555
Han, we need you.

33
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:16,758
- We need?
- Yes.

34
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,359
- What about you need?
- I need?

35
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,945
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:25,594
- You probably don't.
- What precisely am I supposed to know?

37
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:29,180
Come on. You want me to stay because
of the way you feel about me.

38
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,877
Yes. You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

39
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:34,546
No. That's not it.

40
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:36,258
Come on.

41
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:39,570
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

42
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,610
Am I?
Then why are you following me?

43
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,957
Afraid I'd leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

44
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,685
- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
- I can arrange that.

45
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:48,917
You could use a good kiss!

46
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,696
Don't blame me. I didn't ask you
to turn on the thermal heater.

47
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:56,250
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

48
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:58,163
It's supposed to be freezing.

49
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:00,734
How we're going to dry
her clothes I really don't know.

50
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:02,016
Oh, switch off!

51
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,301
Why did you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here.

52
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:07,520
- Excuse me.
- Put them back together right now.

53
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:09,686
- Might I have a word?
- What do you want?

54
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:12,332
Princess Leia's been trying
to get you on the communicator.

55
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:14,613
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

56
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:17,646
Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn't come back.

57
00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:19,996
- She doesn't know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.

58
00:07:20,026 --> 00:07:22,940
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What do you mean, nobody knows?

59
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:24,294
Deck Officer.

60
00:07:24,363 --> 00:07:26,971
- Deck Officer.
- Excuse me, sir. Might l...

61
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,817
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?

62
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:31,651
I haven't seen him. It's possible
he came in the south entrance.

63
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:33,967
It's possible?
Why don't you go find out?

64
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:36,651
- It's getting dark out there.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:39,146
Excuse me, sir.
Might I enquire what's going on?

66
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,562
- Why not?
- Impossible man.

67
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,676
Come along, R2.
Let's find Princess Leia.

68
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:46,891
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

69
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:58,657
Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

70
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,256
- Maybe he forgot to check in.
- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

71
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:03,450
Not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

72
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:06,574
- We'll have to go out on tauntauns.
- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.

73
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:08,703
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

74
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:15,980
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

75
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:18,130
Then I'll see you in hell.

76
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:37,849
You must come along now, R2.

77
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:40,025
There's really
nothing more we can do.

78
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:42,238
And my joints are freezing up.

79
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:47,277
Don't say things like that.
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

80
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,149
And he'll be quite all right.
You'll see.

81
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:53,941
Stupid little short circuit.
He'll be quite all right.

82
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:54,343
Sir, all the patrols are in.
Still no...

83
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:58,431
Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.

84
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:02,646
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

85
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:06,150
although he admits that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

86
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,369
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

87
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:10,838
The shield doors must be closed.

88
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,596
- Close the doors.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:20,952
R2 says the chances
of survival are 725-to-1.

90
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:36,215
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

91
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,855
from time to time.

92
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:42,809
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

93
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:48,432
Don't worry about Master Luke.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

94
00:12:48,444 --> 00:12:51,358
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

95
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,121
<i>Luke.</i>

96
00:13:10,884 --> 00:13:12,276
Luke.

97
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,336
Ben?

98
00:13:21,394 --> 00:13:24,134
You will go to
the Dagobah system.

99
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:25,975
Dagobah system?

100
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:29,611
There you will
learn from Yoda...

101
00:13:29,612 --> 00:13:33,525
the Jedi master
who instructed me.

102
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:55,366
Don't do this, Luke.
Give me a sign here.

103
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:21,346
- Not much time.
- Ben.

104
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,924
Hang on, kid.

105
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:33,354
Dagobah system. Dagobah.

106
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:35,125
This may smell bad, kid...

107
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,430
Yoda.

108
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:43,060
But it'll keep you warm
till I get the shelter up.

109
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:45,193
Ben. Dagobah.

110
00:14:49,027 --> 00:14:51,114
I thought they smelled bad...

111
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:53,067
on the outside.

112
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:38,846
Echo Base, I've got something.

113
00:15:38,868 --> 00:15:40,869
Not much,
but it could be a life form.

114
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,766
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

115
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:52,579
This is Rogue Two.

116
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:55,548
Captain Solo, do you copy?

117
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:04,727
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

118
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:06,643
This is Rogue Two.

119
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:09,907
<i>Good morning.
Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>

120
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:13,903
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

121
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:16,601
I've found them.
Repeat. I've found them.

122
00:16:47,146 --> 00:16:50,536
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

123
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:53,395
- Thanks, 3PO.
- R2 expresses his relief also.

124
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:57,032
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

125
00:16:57,033 --> 00:17:00,034
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

126
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:03,954
- Thanks to you.
- That's two you owe me, junior.

127
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,348
Well, Your Worship...

128
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:08,627
Iooks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

129
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,585
I had nothing to do with it.

130
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,369
General Rieekan thinks
it's dangerous for any ships to leave...

131
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:15,382
until we've activated the energy field.

132
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:16,730
That's a good story.

133
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,847
I think you just can't bear to let a
gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

134
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:24,284
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.

135
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:29,911
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

136
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:33,151
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

137
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,501
She expressed
her true feelings for me.

138
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,704
My...

139
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:40,326
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

140
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,458
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

141
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,621
Who's scruffy-lookin'?

142
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,441
I must have hit close to the mark
to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?

143
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,010
I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

144
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:07,927
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command centre.</i>

145
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:13,819
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command centre.</i>

146
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:15,863
Take it easy.

147
00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:18,036
Excuse us, please.

148
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:22,375
Princess, we have a visitor.

149
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:26,454
We picked up something
outside Zone 12 moving east.

150
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:28,805
- It's metal.
- It couldn't be one of those creatures.

151
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:32,754
- Could be one of our speeders.
- No. Wait.

152
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:35,495
There's something
very weak coming through.

153
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:41,889
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.

154
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,151
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an imperial code.

155
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:53,154
It isn't friendly.
Chewie, let's check it out.

156
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:56,324
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

157
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:34,531
<i>- I'm afraid there's not much left.
- What was it?</i>

158
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:36,699
<i>Droid of some kind.
I didn't hit it that hard.</i>

159
00:19:36,737 --> 00:19:40,323
<i>- Must have had a self-destruct.
- An imperial probe droid.</i>

160
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:43,325
<i>It's a good bet the Empire
knows we're here.</i>

161
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:45,633
We'd better start the evacuation.

162
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:33,151
- Admiral.
- Yes, Captain?

163
00:20:34,462 --> 00:20:37,463
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment...

164
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:40,467
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

165
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:43,680
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

166
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:46,765
- I want proof, not leads.
- The visuals indicate life readings.

167
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:49,116
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...

168
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:52,320
But, sir, the Hoth system is
supposed to be devoid of humans forms.

169
00:20:52,356 --> 00:20:54,792
- You found something?
- Yes, my lord.

170
00:20:57,153 --> 00:20:59,545
That's it.
The rebels are there.

171
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:04,159
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

172
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,031
- It could be smugglers...
- That is the system.

173
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:09,517
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

174
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,668
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

175
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:15,191
General Veers,
prepare your men.

176
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:16,605
Admiral.

177
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:25,523
Groups Seven and 10
will stay behind to fly the speeders.

178
00:21:25,557 --> 00:21:27,470
As soon as each transport is loaded...

179
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:29,647
evacuation control
will give clearance for launch.

180
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:31,426
Right, sir.

181
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:35,655
All right. That's it.

182
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:37,171
Try it.

183
00:21:38,905 --> 00:21:41,731
Turn it off! Turn it off!

184
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:47,537
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47 s.

185
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:51,291
Forget the heavy equipment. There's time
to get small modules on the transports.

186
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:53,423
- Take care, sir.
- Thanks.

187
00:21:56,755 --> 00:22:00,016
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

188
00:22:03,638 --> 00:22:05,334
Okay, okay.

189
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:08,247
Hi, kid.

190
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:11,519
There's gotta be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

191
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,999
Wait a second.

192
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:16,545
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

193
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:24,918
Be careful.

194
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:26,864
You too.

195
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,874
General, there's
a fleet of Stardestroyers...

196
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,269
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

197
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:40,382
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

198
00:22:40,383 --> 00:22:43,594
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

199
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,725
Prepare for ground assault.

200
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:02,989
- What is it, General?
- The fleet has moved out of light speed.

201
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,164
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

202
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:07,896
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

203
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:10,477
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

204
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:13,063
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

205
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:16,295
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

206
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:18,644
He felt surprise was wiser.

207
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:20,847
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

208
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:24,594
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

209
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:26,291
Yes, my lord.

210
00:23:33,104 --> 00:23:34,364
<i>Lord Vader.</i>

211
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:37,570
<i>The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to...</i>

212
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:42,780
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

213
00:23:42,782 --> 00:23:45,260
<i>- Captain Piett.
- Yes, my lord?</i>

214
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:48,409
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

215
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,497
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

216
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:54,792
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

217
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:56,706
<i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>

218
00:23:58,213 --> 00:24:01,424
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

219
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:04,208
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

220
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:06,351
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

221
00:24:06,388 --> 00:24:09,599
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

222
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,210
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

223
00:24:12,228 --> 00:24:14,402
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?

224
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:16,569
The ion cannon will fire
several shots...

225
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:19,860
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

226
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:22,035
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

227
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,202
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

228
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,241
Understood?

229
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:27,937
Good luck.

230
00:24:27,994 --> 00:24:30,558
Everybody to your stations.
Let's go.

231
00:24:47,597 --> 00:24:50,807
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

232
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:52,722
Prepare to open shield.

233
00:24:58,483 --> 00:25:00,744
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

234
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:02,951
Good. Our first catch of the day.

235
00:25:04,906 --> 00:25:07,037
Stand by, ion control.

236
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:09,079
Fire.

237
00:25:24,302 --> 00:25:30,341
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

238
00:25:36,731 --> 00:25:38,688
Feeling all right, sir?

239
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:40,690
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

240
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:43,779
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

241
00:25:43,814 --> 00:25:45,911
I know what you mean.

242
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:07,595
Echo Station 3-T8.
We've spotted imperial walkers.

243
00:26:07,596 --> 00:26:10,161
<i>Imperial walkers
on the north ridge.</i>

244
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:34,554
Echo Station 57,
we're on our way.

245
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:41,967
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

246
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:44,224
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

247
00:26:44,258 --> 00:26:45,780
Steady, Dak.

248
00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:47,757
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

249
00:26:51,472 --> 00:26:53,169
I'm coming in.

250
00:26:57,647 --> 00:26:58,734
Hobbie, you still with me?

251
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,638
That armour's too strong for blasters.

252
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:28,271
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

253
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:30,565
Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance.

254
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:34,153
Stand by, Dak.

255
00:27:34,226 --> 00:27:37,140
Luke, we've got
a malfunction in fire control.

256
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:39,233
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

257
00:27:39,272 --> 00:27:41,229
Just hang on.

258
00:27:41,274 --> 00:27:44,189
Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

259
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:50,491
Dak?

260
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:17,644
Yes, Lord Vader.
I've reached the main power generators.

261
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:20,863
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.

262
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:26,955
Rogue Three.

263
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,509
Copy, Rogue Leader.

264
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:31,658
<i>Wedge, I've lost my gunner.
You'll have to make this shot.</i>

265
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:33,442
<i>I'll cover for you.</i>

266
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:35,930
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

267
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:39,083
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

268
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:43,399
Steady, Rogue Two.

269
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:45,426
Activate harpoon.

270
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:49,951
Good shot, Janson.

271
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,325
One more pass.

272
00:29:03,817 --> 00:29:06,166
Cable out.
Let her go!

273
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:07,457
Detach cable.

274
00:29:08,156 --> 00:29:09,330
Cable detached.

275
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:18,860
Come on!

276
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:29,329
- That got him!
- I see it, Wedge. Good work.

277
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:31,891
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

278
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,322
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

279
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:36,045
We have no choice.

280
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:39,717
- Launch patrol.
- Evacuate remaining ground staff.

281
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:48,153
This one goes there,
that one goes there. Right?

282
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:51,764
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

283
00:29:53,451 --> 00:29:55,669
And do take good care of yourself.

284
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:00,857
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

285
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:27,043
All troops will debark
for ground assault.

286
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:29,636
Prepare to target
the main generator.

287
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:36,786
- Rogue Two, are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

288
00:30:36,787 --> 00:30:38,700
Set harpoon.
I'll cover for you.

289
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:43,252
- Coming around.
- Watch that crossfire, boys.

290
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:46,457
Set for position three.

291
00:30:46,506 --> 00:30:47,855
Steady.

292
00:30:47,924 --> 00:30:50,533
Stay tight and low.
This is it!

293
00:30:56,308 --> 00:30:57,613
Hobbie!

294
00:30:57,684 --> 00:30:59,206
I've been hit!

295
00:31:41,896 --> 00:31:44,679
- You all right?
- Why are you still here?

296
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:47,818
- Heard the command centre had been hit.
- You've got your clearance to leave.

297
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:51,363
Don't worry. I'll leave.
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

298
00:31:51,364 --> 00:31:54,574
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It's our only hope.

299
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:57,794
Send all troops in Sector 12 to
the south slope to protect the fighters.

300
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:01,461
<i>Imperial troops
have entered the base.</i>

301
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:03,194
<i>Imperial troops have entered...</i>

302
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:05,207
Come on. That's it.

303
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:07,689
Give the evacuation code signal.

304
00:32:09,508 --> 00:32:11,640
And get to your transports.

305
00:32:11,677 --> 00:32:12,851
Wait for me.

306
00:32:12,928 --> 00:32:14,450
Begin retreat!

307
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:17,385
Fall back!

308
00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:18,467
- Distance to power generators?
- 17.28.

309
00:33:27,462 --> 00:33:29,462
Target. Maximum firepower.

310
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:58,437
Transport, this is Solo.
Take off. I can't get to you.

311
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:00,453
<i>I'll get her out on the Falcon.
Come on.</i>

312
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:05,129
Where are you going?
Come back!

313
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:27,064
Wait! Wait for me! Stop!

314
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,978
- How typical.
- Come on.

315
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,865
Hurry up, goldenrod!
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

316
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,691
Wait! Wait!

317
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:58,847
- How's this?
- Would it help if I got out and pushed?

318
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:01,152
- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.
- It might.

319
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,135
Sir, might I suggest that you...

320
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,884
It can wait.

321
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,678
This bucket of bolts
will never get past that blockade.

322
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:15,828
This baby's got
a few surprises left in her.

323
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:26,786
Come on! Come on!

324
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,922
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

325
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:32,534
See?

326
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:35,024
Someday you'll be wrong.
I hope I'm there to see it.

327
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:38,979
Punch it!

328
00:35:57,032 --> 00:35:58,076
R2.

329
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,832
Get her ready for take-off.

330
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,300
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

331
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,235
Don't worry, R2.
We're going. We're going.

332
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:28,008
There's nothing wrong, R2.
I'm just setting a new course.

333
00:36:31,317 --> 00:36:35,666
We're not gonna regroup with the others.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

334
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:39,388
Yes, R2.

335
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:45,332
That's all right. I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

336
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:04,411
- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
- Saw what?

337
00:37:04,435 --> 00:37:06,696
Stardestroyers,
two of'em coming right at us.

338
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:09,641
- Sir, might I suggest...
- Shut him up or shut him down!

339
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:13,446
Check the deflector shield.

340
00:37:15,403 --> 00:37:17,535
Great. Well, we can still
outmanoeuvre them.

341
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:23,829
Take evasive action!

342
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,212
- Prepare to jump to light speed.
- But, sir!

343
00:37:39,094 --> 00:37:40,877
They're getting closer.

344
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,148
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

345
00:37:46,185 --> 00:37:47,881
Watch what?

346
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:51,962
- I think we're in trouble.
- If I may say so...

347
00:37:51,982 --> 00:37:54,548
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.

348
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:57,787
- It's impossible to go to light speed.
- We're in trouble.

349
00:38:01,952 --> 00:38:03,256
Horizontal boosters!

350
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:07,500
Alluvial dampers.

351
00:38:10,252 --> 00:38:13,035
That's not it.
Bring me the hydrospanner.

352
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:19,207
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

353
00:38:21,805 --> 00:38:23,065
Chewie!

354
00:38:26,686 --> 00:38:28,816
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

355
00:38:28,855 --> 00:38:30,333
Han, get up here.

356
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:33,501
Come on, Chewie!

357
00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:35,320
Asteroids.

358
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:41,936
- Chewie, set 271.
- What are you doing?

359
00:38:43,327 --> 00:38:45,633
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

360
00:38:45,663 --> 00:38:47,489
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

361
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,626
You don't have to do this
to impress me.

362
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,964
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

363
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:59,357
- is approximately 3,720-to-1.
- Never tell me the odds.

364
00:39:27,206 --> 00:39:30,457
You said you wanted to be around when
I made a mistake. This could be it.

365
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,154
I take it back.

366
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,421
We're gonna get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.

367
00:39:35,422 --> 00:39:37,292
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverized?

368
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,255
I'm going closer
to one of the big ones.

369
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:41,214
- Closer?
- Closer?

370
00:40:08,248 --> 00:40:10,204
This is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

371
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,292
There. That looks pretty good.

372
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:14,291
What looks pretty good?

373
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,815
Yeah. That'll do nicely.

374
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,797
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

375
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:31,949
I hope you know
what you're doing.

376
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:33,459
Yeah. Me too.

377
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:44,547
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

378
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:49,217
No, I'm not gonna change
my mind about this.

379
00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:52,648
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.

380
00:40:52,668 --> 00:40:54,798
Massive life form readings though.

381
00:40:55,795 --> 00:40:57,926
There's something alive down there.

382
00:40:59,508 --> 00:41:02,509
Yes. I'm sure
it's perfectly safe for droids.

383
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,885
I know! I know!

384
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:14,721
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

385
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:17,906
Just hang on.
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

386
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:14,656
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.

387
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:20,309
R2?

388
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,394
Where are you?

389
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:30,364
R2!

390
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:38,800
You be more careful.

391
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:44,694
R2, that way.

392
00:43:12,644 --> 00:43:14,036
R2!

393
00:43:41,632 --> 00:43:43,197
Oh, no.

394
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:46,516
Are you all right?
Come on.

395
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:52,105
You were lucky
to get out of there.

396
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:55,140
Anything broken?

397
00:43:57,814 --> 00:44:01,026
If you're saying
coming here was a bad idea...

398
00:44:01,027 --> 00:44:03,289
I'm beginning to agree with ya.

399
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:06,104
R2, what are we doing here?

400
00:44:06,116 --> 00:44:07,595
It's like...

401
00:44:08,618 --> 00:44:10,749
something out of a dream or...

402
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:13,753
I don't know.

403
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,922
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

404
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,636
Yes, Admiral?

405
00:44:49,703 --> 00:44:51,876
<i>Our ships have sighted
the Millennium Falcon, lord...</i>

406
00:44:51,911 --> 00:44:55,123
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

407
00:44:55,124 --> 00:44:58,037
Asteroids do not
concern me, Admiral.

408
00:44:58,044 --> 00:45:01,741
- I want that ship, not excuses.
- Yes, lord.

409
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,931
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

410
00:45:10,932 --> 00:45:15,019
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does
that include shutting me down too?

411
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,150
<i>No. I need you
to talk to the Falcon...</i>

412
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,538
find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

413
00:45:27,282 --> 00:45:30,910
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

414
00:45:30,911 --> 00:45:32,867
Not entirely stable?

415
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:35,043
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

416
00:45:35,081 --> 00:45:38,792
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

417
00:45:38,793 --> 00:45:41,403
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behaviour.

418
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:43,857
After all, I'm only
trying to do my job.

419
00:45:48,845 --> 00:45:50,324
Let go.

420
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:54,491
- Let go, please.
- Don't get excited.

421
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,355
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

422
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:00,270
Sorry, sweetheart.

423
00:46:00,317 --> 00:46:03,099
I haven't got time
for anything else.

424
00:46:37,437 --> 00:46:41,004
Ready for some power?
Okay.

425
00:46:44,861 --> 00:46:46,340
Let's see now.

426
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,796
Put that in there.
There you go.

427
00:46:51,828 --> 00:46:54,698
Now all I gotta do
is find this Yoda...

428
00:46:54,705 --> 00:46:57,098
if he even exists.

429
00:47:02,504 --> 00:47:05,549
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

430
00:47:06,885 --> 00:47:08,798
This place gives me the creeps.

431
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,117
Still...

432
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,437
there's something familiar
about this place.

433
00:47:19,605 --> 00:47:21,475
I don't know.

434
00:47:21,524 --> 00:47:23,655
- I feel like...
- Feel like what?

435
00:47:24,652 --> 00:47:26,348
Like we're being watched.

436
00:47:26,403 --> 00:47:29,534
Away put your weapon.
I mean you no harm.

437
00:47:30,657 --> 00:47:33,442
I am wondering,
why are you here?

438
00:47:35,038 --> 00:47:38,165
- I'm looking for someone.
- Looking?

439
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:40,905
Found someone you have,
I would say.

440
00:47:42,003 --> 00:47:43,612
Right.

441
00:47:44,506 --> 00:47:46,985
Help you I can. Yes.

442
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,020
I don't think so.

443
00:47:50,596 --> 00:47:53,423
I'm looking for a great warrior.

444
00:47:53,432 --> 00:47:55,128
Great warrior.

445
00:47:58,144 --> 00:48:00,493
Wars not make one great.

446
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,564
Put that down.

447
00:48:10,616 --> 00:48:12,617
Hey! That's my dinner.

448
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,698
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

449
00:48:18,707 --> 00:48:21,013
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

450
00:48:21,043 --> 00:48:23,695
If we could get our ship out, we would.
But we can't.

451
00:48:23,712 --> 00:48:25,887
Aw, cannot get your ship out.

452
00:48:25,923 --> 00:48:27,663
Get out of there.

453
00:48:30,845 --> 00:48:33,236
Hey, you could have broken this.

454
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:36,896
Don't do that.

455
00:48:45,901 --> 00:48:48,033
You're making a mess.

456
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:51,577
Hey, give me that.

457
00:48:51,616 --> 00:48:54,268
Mine, or I will help you not.

458
00:48:54,286 --> 00:48:56,374
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

459
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:59,284
I'm gonna need it to get out of
this slimy mud-hole.

460
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:01,509
Mud-hole? Slimy?
My home this is.

461
00:49:05,296 --> 00:49:06,775
R2, let him have it.

462
00:49:09,426 --> 00:49:12,253
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- R2.

463
00:49:16,058 --> 00:49:19,580
Will you move along, little fella?
We got a lot of work to do.

464
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,869
Stay and help you I will.
Find your friend.

465
00:49:24,608 --> 00:49:27,608
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

466
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:32,092
Jedi master. Yoda.

467
00:49:32,116 --> 00:49:34,812
- You seek Yoda.
- You know him?

468
00:49:36,495 --> 00:49:38,626
Take you to him I will.

469
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:43,043
Yes, yes, but now we must eat.

470
00:49:43,044 --> 00:49:45,827
Come.
Good food. Come.

471
00:49:55,515 --> 00:49:57,211
Come, come.

472
00:49:59,353 --> 00:50:00,483
R2...

473
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:03,660
stay and watch after the camp.

474
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,250
Where is R2 when I need him?

475
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:22,073
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

476
00:50:22,084 --> 00:50:24,084
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

477
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:27,755
I believe it says the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized.

478
00:50:27,756 --> 00:50:30,321
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

479
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,650
Well, of course
I'll have to replace it.

480
00:50:34,805 --> 00:50:37,110
Here. And, Chewie...

481
00:50:38,684 --> 00:50:41,467
I think we better replace
the negative power coupling.

482
00:51:03,751 --> 00:51:06,535
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

483
00:51:06,546 --> 00:51:09,113
Would you please
stop calling me that?

484
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:11,175
Sure, Leia.

485
00:51:11,217 --> 00:51:14,783
- You make it so difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.

486
00:51:15,722 --> 00:51:18,070
You could be a little nicer though.

487
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:20,882
Admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

488
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:25,494
Occasionally, maybe...

489
00:51:25,522 --> 00:51:28,089
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

490
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,588
Scoundrel?

491
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,274
I like the sound of that.

492
00:51:36,285 --> 00:51:39,197
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

493
00:51:39,204 --> 00:51:41,465
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

494
00:51:41,497 --> 00:51:43,759
My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?

495
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:46,010
- Afraid?
- You're trembling.

496
00:51:46,879 --> 00:51:49,053
I'm not trembling.

497
00:51:50,424 --> 00:51:52,990
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

498
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:55,532
There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.

499
00:51:55,554 --> 00:51:57,685
I happen to like nice men.

500
00:51:57,723 --> 00:52:00,506
- I'm a nice man.
- No, you're not.

501
00:52:03,313 --> 00:52:04,357
Sir, sir!

502
00:52:04,439 --> 00:52:07,439
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

503
00:52:09,568 --> 00:52:10,830
Thank you.

504
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:13,991
- Thank you very much.
- You're perfectly welcome, sir.

505
00:52:19,955 --> 00:52:23,206
<i>That, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>

506
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:26,251
<i>Considering the damage we've sustained,
they must have been destroyed.</i>

507
00:52:26,252 --> 00:52:29,671
No, Captain, they're alive.

508
00:52:29,672 --> 00:52:34,195
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

509
00:52:38,557 --> 00:52:41,976
- Lord Vader.
- Yes, Admiral. What is it?

510
00:52:41,977 --> 00:52:44,325
The emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

511
00:52:44,354 --> 00:52:46,616
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

512
00:52:46,648 --> 00:52:48,997
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

513
00:52:49,025 --> 00:52:50,721
Yes, my lord.

514
00:53:07,252 --> 00:53:09,905
What is thy bidding, my master?

515
00:53:11,089 --> 00:53:15,308
<i>There is a great disturbance
in the Force.</i>

516
00:53:16,012 --> 00:53:18,446
I have felt it.

517
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:21,125
<i>We have a new enemy...</i>

518
00:53:21,142 --> 00:53:25,270
<i>the young rebel who destroyed
the Death Star.</i>

519
00:53:25,271 --> 00:53:28,523
<i>I have no doubt this boy...</i>

520
00:53:28,524 --> 00:53:33,028
<i>is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.</i>

521
00:53:33,029 --> 00:53:35,377
How is that possible?

522
00:53:35,406 --> 00:53:38,909
<i>Search your feelings, Lord Vader.</i>

523
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:42,246
<i>You will know it to be true.</i>

524
00:53:42,247 --> 00:53:44,813
<i>He could destroy us.</i>

525
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:47,007
He's just a boy.

526
00:53:47,044 --> 00:53:49,610
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

527
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:53,370
<i>The Force is strong with him.</i>

528
00:53:54,593 --> 00:53:59,638
<i>The son of Skywalker
must not become a Jedi.</i>

529
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:01,900
If he could be turned...

530
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:04,891
he would become a powerful ally.

531
00:54:05,812 --> 00:54:07,596
<i>Yes.</i>

532
00:54:08,398 --> 00:54:12,778
<i>He would be a great asset.</i>

533
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:15,126
<i>Can it be done?</i>

534
00:54:15,155 --> 00:54:19,286
He will join us or die, master.

535
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,806
I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't
understand why we can't see Yoda now.

536
00:54:39,807 --> 00:54:43,763
Patience. For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

537
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,065
Eat. Eat.

538
00:54:49,858 --> 00:54:51,249
Hot.

539
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,993
Good food. Good.

540
00:55:01,035 --> 00:55:04,080
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

541
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:06,429
Not far. Yoda not far.

542
00:55:06,457 --> 00:55:09,328
Patience.
Soon you will be with him.

543
00:55:11,629 --> 00:55:14,414
Root leaf. I cook.

544
00:55:16,135 --> 00:55:18,701
Why wish you become Jedi?

545
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,464
Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.

546
00:55:22,474 --> 00:55:25,692
Father.
Powerful Jedi was he.

547
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:28,889
- Powerful Jedi.
- Oh, come on.

548
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,560
How could you know my father?
You don't even know who I am.

549
00:55:32,568 --> 00:55:36,221
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

550
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:39,881
I cannot teach him.

551
00:55:39,909 --> 00:55:42,039
The boy has no patience.

552
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:44,426
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

553
00:55:49,168 --> 00:55:51,646
Much anger in him...

554
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:53,584
like his father.

555
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:57,502
<i>Was I any different
when you taught me?</i>

556
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,720
No.

557
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:03,987
- He is not ready.
- Yoda.

558
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:08,891
I am ready.

559
00:56:08,939 --> 00:56:12,442
I can be a Jedi.
Ben, tell him I'm...

560
00:56:12,477 --> 00:56:15,945
Ready, are you?
What know you ready?

561
00:56:15,946 --> 00:56:20,032
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

562
00:56:20,033 --> 00:56:23,947
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

563
00:56:25,747 --> 00:56:29,668
AJedi must have
the deepest commitment...

564
00:56:29,669 --> 00:56:31,582
the most serious mind.

565
00:56:33,506 --> 00:56:36,723
This one a long time have I watched.

566
00:56:37,676 --> 00:56:40,546
All his life
has he looked away...

567
00:56:40,554 --> 00:56:43,723
to the future,
to the horizon.

568
00:56:43,724 --> 00:56:47,422
Never his mind on where he was...

569
00:56:48,603 --> 00:56:50,734
what he was doing.

570
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:53,402
Adventure.

571
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:56,431
Excitement.

572
00:56:56,487 --> 00:56:58,836
AJedi craves not these things.

573
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:01,569
You are reckless.

574
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,703
<i>So was I, if you remember.</i>

575
00:57:04,704 --> 00:57:06,835
He is too old.

576
00:57:08,749 --> 00:57:11,011
Yes, too old to begin the training.

577
00:57:11,043 --> 00:57:13,044
But I've learned so much.

578
00:57:20,803 --> 00:57:24,195
- Will he finish what he begins?
- I won't fail you.

579
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:27,340
I'm not afraid.

580
00:57:31,772 --> 00:57:33,903
You will be.

581
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:37,116
You will be.

582
00:58:19,113 --> 00:58:22,742
- Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
- I'm not interested in your opinion.

583
00:58:22,743 --> 00:58:24,830
There's something out there.

584
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,913
- Where?
- Outside in the cave.

585
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:30,104
There it is. Listen!

586
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:32,123
- I'm going out there.
- Are you crazy?

587
00:58:32,168 --> 00:58:34,821
I just got this bucket together.
I won't let it get torn apart.

588
00:58:34,837 --> 00:58:37,056
Then I'm going with you.

589
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:41,426
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

590
00:58:41,427 --> 00:58:42,470
Oh, no.

591
00:58:57,528 --> 00:58:59,659
This ground sure feels strange.

592
00:59:01,198 --> 00:59:03,330
It doesn't feel like rock.

593
00:59:07,747 --> 00:59:10,442
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

594
00:59:10,457 --> 00:59:14,294
I don't know.
I have a bad feeling about this.

595
00:59:14,295 --> 00:59:15,556
Yeah.

596
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:18,546
Watch out!

597
00:59:19,634 --> 00:59:22,199
It's all right. It's all right.

598
00:59:22,219 --> 00:59:24,785
Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock.

599
00:59:24,805 --> 00:59:28,057
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached...

600
00:59:28,058 --> 00:59:30,016
chewing on the power cables.

601
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,713
Mynocks?

602
00:59:31,771 --> 00:59:34,076
Go inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

603
00:59:43,157 --> 00:59:45,724
Go away!
Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!

604
00:59:52,918 --> 00:59:54,831
Wait a minute.

605
01:00:16,484 --> 01:00:20,027
- Chewie, let's get out of here!
- The Empire is still out there!

606
01:00:20,028 --> 01:00:22,159
No time to discuss this
in committee!

607
01:00:22,823 --> 01:00:24,954
I am not a committee!

608
01:00:30,331 --> 01:00:33,288
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

609
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:35,858
Sit down, sweetheart.
We're taking off.

610
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:41,941
- Look!
- I see it.

611
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:44,489
- We're doomed!
- The cave is collapsing.

612
01:00:44,513 --> 01:00:46,469
- This is no cave.
- What?

613
01:01:18,881 --> 01:01:20,316
Yes, run.

614
01:01:20,381 --> 01:01:21,990
Yes.

615
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:25,512
A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

616
01:01:25,513 --> 01:01:29,056
But beware of the dark side.
Anger, fear, aggression...

617
01:01:29,057 --> 01:01:31,319
The dark side
of the Force are they.

618
01:01:31,351 --> 01:01:35,062
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

619
01:01:35,063 --> 01:01:37,369
If once you start down
the dark path...

620
01:01:37,399 --> 01:01:39,791
forever will it dominate
your destiny.

621
01:01:39,818 --> 01:01:43,905
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

622
01:01:43,906 --> 01:01:45,819
Vader.

623
01:01:45,866 --> 01:01:49,084
- Is the dark side stronger?
- No, no.

624
01:01:50,705 --> 01:01:52,748
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

625
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:55,716
How am I to know
the good side from the bad?

626
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:58,100
You will know...

627
01:01:58,129 --> 01:02:00,477
when you are calm,
at peace...

628
01:02:01,466 --> 01:02:02,944
passive.

629
01:02:03,968 --> 01:02:08,263
A Jedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defence...

630
01:02:08,265 --> 01:02:10,178
never for attack.

631
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:13,977
- But tell me why I can't...
- No. There is no why.

632
01:02:13,978 --> 01:02:16,848
Nothing more
will I teach you today.

633
01:02:16,856 --> 01:02:18,900
Clear your mind of questions.

634
01:02:41,923 --> 01:02:43,967
There's something not right here.

635
01:02:47,763 --> 01:02:49,241
I feel cold.

636
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,666
- Death.
- That place...

637
01:02:52,726 --> 01:02:56,354
is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

638
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:58,356
A domain of evil it is.

639
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,735
In you must go.

640
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:04,124
What's in there?

641
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:09,216
Only what you take with you.

642
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,176
Your weapons...

643
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,521
you will not need them.

644
01:05:56,706 --> 01:05:59,272
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.

645
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:02,163
- Yes, sir.
- Those rebels won't escape us.

646
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,179
<i>Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Stardestroyer Avenger.</i>

647
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,789
Right.

648
01:06:12,848 --> 01:06:18,770
<i>There will be a substantial reward for
the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.</i>

649
01:06:18,771 --> 01:06:21,941
You are free to use
any methods necessary...

650
01:06:21,942 --> 01:06:24,159
but I want them alive.

651
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:26,715
No disintegrations.

652
01:06:26,736 --> 01:06:28,650
- As you wish.
- Lord Vader.

653
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:32,868
My lord, we have them.

654
01:06:37,249 --> 01:06:40,466
Thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

655
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:48,286
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

656
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,606
One, two...

657
01:06:50,637 --> 01:06:51,810
three!

658
01:06:58,395 --> 01:07:00,744
It's not fair.

659
01:07:02,233 --> 01:07:05,146
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault.

660
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:08,195
- No light speed?
- It's not my fault.

661
01:07:12,869 --> 01:07:14,956
Sir, we just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

662
01:07:14,996 --> 01:07:17,344
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

663
01:07:17,372 --> 01:07:19,155
Turn her around.

664
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:21,947
Turn her around! I'm gonna
put all power in the front shield.

665
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,048
- You're gonna attack?
- The odds of surviving...

666
01:07:24,088 --> 01:07:26,089
a direct assault
on an imperial Stardestroyer...

667
01:07:26,131 --> 01:07:28,131
Shut up!

668
01:07:34,556 --> 01:07:36,600
They're moving to attack position.

669
01:07:38,728 --> 01:07:39,858
Shields up.

670
01:07:46,402 --> 01:07:49,098
Track them. They may
come around for another pass.

671
01:07:49,113 --> 01:07:51,591
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

672
01:07:51,616 --> 01:07:55,368
They can't have disappeared. No ship
that small has a cloaking device.

673
01:07:55,369 --> 01:07:59,371
- There's no trace of them.
- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.

674
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,340
Get a shuttle ready.

675
01:08:04,378 --> 01:08:08,423
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.

676
01:08:08,424 --> 01:08:11,642
- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
- Yes, Captain Needa.

677
01:08:16,224 --> 01:08:18,572
Use the Force.

678
01:08:18,602 --> 01:08:19,645
Yes.

679
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,060
Now, the stone.

680
01:08:31,155 --> 01:08:32,852
Feel it.

681
01:08:44,502 --> 01:08:46,372
Concentrate!

682
01:09:00,978 --> 01:09:04,147
Oh, no.
We'll never get it out now.

683
01:09:04,148 --> 01:09:05,932
So certain are you.

684
01:09:09,947 --> 01:09:13,294
Always with you
it cannot be done.

685
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:16,452
Hear you nothing that I say?

686
01:09:16,494 --> 01:09:18,669
Master, moving stones
around is one thing.

687
01:09:18,705 --> 01:09:20,618
This is totally different.

688
01:09:20,665 --> 01:09:23,013
No. No different.

689
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:25,218
Only different in your mind.

690
01:09:25,254 --> 01:09:28,601
You must unlearn
what you have learned.

691
01:09:29,841 --> 01:09:33,059
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Try not.

692
01:09:33,804 --> 01:09:35,282
Do...

693
01:09:35,347 --> 01:09:37,000
or do not.

694
01:09:37,057 --> 01:09:38,797
There is no try.

695
01:10:27,358 --> 01:10:30,402
I can't. It's too big.

696
01:10:30,403 --> 01:10:32,535
Size matters not.

697
01:10:32,572 --> 01:10:35,703
Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?

698
01:10:38,327 --> 01:10:41,328
And well you should not...

699
01:10:41,331 --> 01:10:44,072
for my ally is the Force.

700
01:10:44,084 --> 01:10:46,563
And a powerful ally it is.

701
01:10:47,546 --> 01:10:50,025
Life creates it...

702
01:10:50,049 --> 01:10:52,179
makes it grow.

703
01:10:52,968 --> 01:10:55,882
Its energy surrounds us...

704
01:10:56,806 --> 01:10:58,675
and binds us.

705
01:10:58,723 --> 01:11:02,073
Luminous beings are we,
not this crude matter.

706
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:06,412
You must feel
the Force around you.

707
01:11:07,149 --> 01:11:09,845
Here, between you, me...

708
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:12,960
the tree, the rock...

709
01:11:12,989 --> 01:11:15,163
everywhere.

710
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,677
Yes...

711
01:11:16,742 --> 01:11:20,699
even between
the land and the ship.

712
01:11:25,459 --> 01:11:27,809
You want the impossible.

713
01:13:15,238 --> 01:13:17,369
I don't believe it.

714
01:13:19,285 --> 01:13:22,068
That is why you fail.

715
01:13:41,222 --> 01:13:44,614
Apology accepted,
Captain Needa.

716
01:13:52,985 --> 01:13:56,155
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan and found nothing.

717
01:13:56,156 --> 01:13:58,199
<i>If the Millennium Falcon
went into light speed...</i>

718
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,241
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy now.

719
01:14:00,285 --> 01:14:02,198
Alert all commands.

720
01:14:02,245 --> 01:14:06,624
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

721
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:10,146
- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
- Don't fail me again...

722
01:14:10,962 --> 01:14:13,049
Admiral.

723
01:14:15,133 --> 01:14:18,568
Alert all commands.
Deploy the fleet.

724
01:14:33,443 --> 01:14:36,737
Captain Solo,
this time you have gone too far.

725
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,949
I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

726
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:42,080
The fleet's beginning to break up.

727
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:45,120
Go stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.

728
01:14:47,333 --> 01:14:49,419
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

729
01:14:49,459 --> 01:14:53,046
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

730
01:14:53,047 --> 01:14:55,221
The Empire may be
gracious enough...

731
01:14:55,258 --> 01:14:57,780
- Thank you.
- What did you have in mind next?

732
01:14:57,802 --> 01:14:59,802
If they follow standard
imperial procedure...

733
01:14:59,845 --> 01:15:02,194
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed.

734
01:15:02,223 --> 01:15:05,349
- Then we just float away.
- With the rest of the garbage.

735
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:06,829
Then what?

736
01:15:06,894 --> 01:15:10,272
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.

737
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:11,708
Any ideas?

738
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:14,253
- Where are we?
- The Anoat system.

739
01:15:14,277 --> 01:15:16,973
The Anoat system.
There's not much there.

740
01:15:16,988 --> 01:15:19,945
Oh, wait.
This is interesting.

741
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:22,950
- Lando.
- Lando system?

742
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:26,663
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

743
01:15:26,664 --> 01:15:29,013
Card player, gambler.

744
01:15:29,042 --> 01:15:31,737
- A scoundrel. You'd like him.
- Thanks.

745
01:15:31,752 --> 01:15:34,536
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

746
01:15:35,924 --> 01:15:39,099
- A mining colony?
- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

747
01:15:39,845 --> 01:15:42,063
Lando conned somebody out of it.

748
01:15:42,097 --> 01:15:44,924
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.

749
01:15:46,225 --> 01:15:49,009
- Can you trust him?
- No.

750
01:15:49,021 --> 01:15:52,022
But he's got no love for the Empire.
I can tell you that.

751
01:15:52,983 --> 01:15:55,724
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by. Detach.

752
01:16:02,826 --> 01:16:04,435
You do have your moments.

753
01:16:05,245 --> 01:16:08,202
Not many of them,
but you do have them.

754
01:16:42,867 --> 01:16:44,868
Concentrate.

755
01:16:44,911 --> 01:16:48,247
Feel the Force flow.

756
01:16:48,248 --> 01:16:49,944
Yes.

757
01:16:57,549 --> 01:16:59,289
Good.

758
01:16:59,343 --> 01:17:00,778
Calm.

759
01:17:00,843 --> 01:17:02,235
Yes.

760
01:17:03,137 --> 01:17:05,791
Through the Force,
things you will see.

761
01:17:05,808 --> 01:17:09,393
Other places.
The future. The past.

762
01:17:09,394 --> 01:17:11,916
Old friends long gone.

763
01:17:22,325 --> 01:17:23,846
Control, control.

764
01:17:23,909 --> 01:17:26,215
You must learn control.

765
01:17:29,165 --> 01:17:32,209
I saw a city in the clouds.

766
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:36,431
Friends you have there.

767
01:17:37,423 --> 01:17:41,206
- They were in pain.
- It is the future you see.

768
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:43,305
Future?

769
01:17:52,272 --> 01:17:53,750
Will they die?

770
01:17:56,943 --> 01:17:59,119
Difficult to see.

771
01:17:59,154 --> 01:18:01,720
Always in motion is the future.

772
01:18:04,117 --> 01:18:05,595
I've gotta go to them.

773
01:18:07,537 --> 01:18:10,707
Decide you must
how to serve them best.

774
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:13,709
If you leave now,
help them you could...

775
01:18:14,669 --> 01:18:18,367
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

776
01:18:32,272 --> 01:18:35,185
No, I don't have a landing permit.

777
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:38,944
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

778
01:18:38,945 --> 01:18:41,163
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!

779
01:18:41,197 --> 01:18:43,240
<i>You will not deviate
from your present course.</i>

780
01:18:43,282 --> 01:18:46,109
- Rather touchy, aren't they?
- I thought you knew this person.

781
01:18:48,913 --> 01:18:51,826
That was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

782
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,052
<i>Permission granted to land
on Platform 327.</i>

783
01:19:04,053 --> 01:19:05,488
Thank you.

784
01:19:06,348 --> 01:19:09,349
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

785
01:19:09,351 --> 01:19:11,090
Who's worried?

786
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:01,339
No one to meet us.

787
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:05,133
I don't like this.

788
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:08,115
- What would you like?
- They did let us land.

789
01:20:08,119 --> 01:20:10,946
Look, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

790
01:20:10,956 --> 01:20:12,651
Trust me.

791
01:20:17,337 --> 01:20:19,468
See? My friend.

792
01:20:23,802 --> 01:20:25,933
Keep your eyes open.

793
01:20:28,556 --> 01:20:30,253
Hey.

794
01:20:30,308 --> 01:20:34,520
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

795
01:20:34,521 --> 01:20:38,914
You've got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.

796
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:52,830
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

797
01:20:52,831 --> 01:20:55,999
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Well, he seems very friendly.

798
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,212
Yes. Very friendly.

799
01:20:59,213 --> 01:21:00,909
What are you doing here?

800
01:21:00,965 --> 01:21:03,052
Repairs. I thought
you could help me out.

801
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:05,831
- What have you done to my ship?
- Your ship?

802
01:21:05,845 --> 01:21:09,542
Hey, remember,
you lost her to me fair and square.

803
01:21:10,266 --> 01:21:11,701
How you doin', Chewbacca?

804
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,385
Still hanging around with this loser?

805
01:21:17,273 --> 01:21:19,708
Hello.
What have we here?

806
01:21:21,111 --> 01:21:24,779
Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this facility.

807
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:27,825
- And who might you be?
- Leia.

808
01:21:27,826 --> 01:21:29,522
Welcome, Leia.

809
01:21:32,289 --> 01:21:35,246
All right, all right.
You old smoothie.

810
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:39,002
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

811
01:21:39,003 --> 01:21:41,917
My facilities are at your...
Well, really!

812
01:21:41,923 --> 01:21:44,403
<i>- What's wrong with the Falcon?
- Hyperdrive.</i>

813
01:21:44,427 --> 01:21:46,557
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

814
01:21:46,596 --> 01:21:48,726
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

815
01:21:48,763 --> 01:21:51,416
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

816
01:21:52,643 --> 01:21:55,209
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

817
01:21:55,229 --> 01:21:59,190
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.

818
01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:02,402
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

819
01:22:02,403 --> 01:22:04,663
I've had labour difficulties.

820
01:22:04,697 --> 01:22:08,073
- What's so funny?
- You. Listen to you.

821
01:22:08,074 --> 01:22:10,989
You sound like a businessman,
a responsible leader.

822
01:22:10,995 --> 01:22:12,952
Who'd have thought that, huh?

823
01:22:12,997 --> 01:22:16,042
Seeing you sure brings back
a few things.

824
01:22:16,077 --> 01:22:17,303
Yeah.

825
01:22:17,377 --> 01:22:19,593
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

826
01:22:20,379 --> 01:22:23,163
It's the price you pay
for being successful.

827
01:22:26,303 --> 01:22:28,434
Nice to see a familiar face.

828
01:22:28,471 --> 01:22:30,167
How rude!

829
01:22:31,683 --> 01:22:33,813
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

830
01:22:33,851 --> 01:22:35,504
I wonder if... Hello?

831
01:22:37,688 --> 01:22:39,298
How interesting.

832
01:22:39,358 --> 01:22:42,567
- Who are you?
- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.

833
01:22:42,568 --> 01:22:44,700
I didn't mean to intrude.
Please don't get up.

834
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:05,786
Luke, you must complete the training.

835
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,675
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
I've gotta help them.

836
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,898
You must not go.

837
01:23:11,932 --> 01:23:15,149
<i>- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
- You don't know that.</i>

838
01:23:18,021 --> 01:23:20,805
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

839
01:23:20,816 --> 01:23:23,687
But I can help them.
I feel the Force.

840
01:23:23,694 --> 01:23:25,955
But you cannot control it.

841
01:23:26,072 --> 01:23:28,507
This is a dangerous time for you...

842
01:23:28,532 --> 01:23:31,659
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

843
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:35,009
Yes, yes.
To Obi-Wan you listen.

844
01:23:35,748 --> 01:23:37,226
The cave.

845
01:23:37,292 --> 01:23:39,466
Remember your failure at the cave.

846
01:23:39,503 --> 01:23:41,504
But I've learned
so much since then.

847
01:23:41,546 --> 01:23:44,328
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and finish what I've begun.

848
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,385
You have my word.

849
01:23:46,425 --> 01:23:49,339
It is you and your abilities
the emperor wants.

850
01:23:49,345 --> 01:23:52,172
That is why your friends
are made to suffer.

851
01:23:53,516 --> 01:23:56,299
That's why I have to go.

852
01:23:56,312 --> 01:24:00,773
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor the way I lost Vader.

853
01:24:00,774 --> 01:24:02,340
You won't.

854
01:24:03,235 --> 01:24:06,888
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.

855
01:24:07,615 --> 01:24:11,200
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,
with the Force as his ally...

856
01:24:11,201 --> 01:24:13,897
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

857
01:24:13,912 --> 01:24:16,086
If you end your training now...

858
01:24:16,123 --> 01:24:20,543
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

859
01:24:20,544 --> 01:24:23,285
you will become an agent of evil.

860
01:24:23,297 --> 01:24:24,297
Patience.

861
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:29,719
- And sacrifice Han and Leia?
- If you honour what they fight for...

862
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,764
yes.

863
01:24:30,846 --> 01:24:34,057
If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.

864
01:24:34,058 --> 01:24:36,146
I cannot interfere.

865
01:24:38,146 --> 01:24:39,407
I understand.

866
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:47,775
R2, fire up the converters.

867
01:24:53,035 --> 01:24:55,079
Don't give in to hate.

868
01:24:55,121 --> 01:24:57,991
That leads to the dark side.

869
01:24:57,999 --> 01:24:59,782
Strong is Vader.

870
01:24:59,834 --> 01:25:02,444
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

871
01:25:03,296 --> 01:25:04,862
I will.

872
01:25:04,924 --> 01:25:07,489
And I'll return. I promise.

873
01:25:14,474 --> 01:25:17,643
Told you, I did.
Reckless is he.

874
01:25:17,644 --> 01:25:19,297
Now...

875
01:25:19,354 --> 01:25:21,180
matters are worse.

876
01:25:21,231 --> 01:25:23,363
<i>That boy is our last hope.</i>

877
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,444
No, there is another.

878
01:25:58,477 --> 01:26:01,897
The ship's almost finished. Two or three
more things and we're in great shape.

879
01:26:01,899 --> 01:26:04,028
The sooner the better.
Something's wrong here.

880
01:26:04,065 --> 01:26:06,197
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

881
01:26:06,235 --> 01:26:08,541
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

882
01:26:08,571 --> 01:26:10,354
Relax.

883
01:26:10,406 --> 01:26:13,407
I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

884
01:26:13,409 --> 01:26:15,976
I don't trust Lando.

885
01:26:15,995 --> 01:26:19,456
Well, I don't trust him either,
but he is my friend.

886
01:26:19,457 --> 01:26:22,241
Besides, we'll soon be gone.

887
01:26:23,587 --> 01:26:25,718
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

888
01:27:00,666 --> 01:27:02,231
What happened?

889
01:27:03,253 --> 01:27:03,948
Where?

890
01:27:06,089 --> 01:27:08,177
Found him in a junk pile?

891
01:27:08,215 --> 01:27:10,868
What a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

892
01:27:12,929 --> 01:27:16,581
- Lando's got people that can fix him.
- No, thanks.

893
01:27:18,017 --> 01:27:19,931
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting anything?

894
01:27:20,812 --> 01:27:21,986
Not really.

895
01:27:25,483 --> 01:27:27,570
You look absolutely beautiful.

896
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:31,029
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

897
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:32,552
Thank you.

898
01:27:32,615 --> 01:27:35,660
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

899
01:27:35,661 --> 01:27:38,574
Everyone's invited, of course.

900
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:40,754
Having trouble with your droid?

901
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:43,530
No. No problem. Why?

902
01:27:52,261 --> 01:27:54,870
You see, since we're
a small operation...

903
01:27:54,889 --> 01:27:58,265
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

904
01:27:58,266 --> 01:28:00,919
- So you're part of the Mining Guild?
- No, not actually.

905
01:28:00,936 --> 01:28:03,198
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.

906
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:05,361
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

907
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:09,944
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

908
01:28:09,945 --> 01:28:13,948
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
gonna find out, shut you down?

909
01:28:13,949 --> 01:28:17,369
It's been a danger that looms like
a shadow over everything we've built.

910
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:20,196
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

911
01:28:20,207 --> 01:28:23,641
I've just made a deal that'll keep
the Empire out of here forever.

912
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:36,134
We would be honoured
if you would join us.

913
01:28:42,896 --> 01:28:45,375
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

914
01:28:46,233 --> 01:28:47,972
I'm sorry.

915
01:28:51,404 --> 01:28:52,796
I'm sorry too.

916
01:29:07,587 --> 01:29:09,023
No, 3PO's with them.

917
01:29:10,382 --> 01:29:12,556
Just hang on.
We're almost there.

918
01:30:12,029 --> 01:30:14,595
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.

919
01:30:14,615 --> 01:30:16,658
No, please don't get up.

920
01:30:22,414 --> 01:30:25,918
Stormtroopers? Here?
We're in danger.

921
01:30:25,919 --> 01:30:28,614
I must tell the others.
Oh, no! I've been shot!

922
01:30:56,324 --> 01:30:58,020
Lord Vader.

923
01:30:58,075 --> 01:31:00,554
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

924
01:31:00,578 --> 01:31:02,665
after I have Skywalker.

925
01:31:02,705 --> 01:31:04,662
He's no good to me dead.

926
01:31:04,707 --> 01:31:08,143
He will not be
permanently damaged.

927
01:31:10,421 --> 01:31:13,074
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

928
01:31:13,091 --> 01:31:15,918
They must never again leave this city.

929
01:31:15,927 --> 01:31:19,264
That wasn't part of our agreement, nor
was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

930
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:23,352
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

931
01:31:25,937 --> 01:31:26,981
No.

932
01:31:27,064 --> 01:31:30,760
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

933
01:31:33,028 --> 01:31:35,508
This deal is getting worse
all the time.

934
01:31:36,615 --> 01:31:39,095
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

935
01:31:40,618 --> 01:31:43,271
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

936
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:48,012
That's much better.

937
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:49,740
Wait. Wait.

938
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:51,927
Oh, my!
What have you done?

939
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:53,573
I'm backwards!

940
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:55,589
You flea-bitten furball!

941
01:31:55,634 --> 01:31:58,418
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

942
01:32:12,903 --> 01:32:14,947
I feel terrible.

943
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:32,259
Why are they doing this?

944
01:32:34,675 --> 01:32:37,458
They never even asked me
any questions.

945
01:32:46,687 --> 01:32:48,949
- Get out of here, Lando.
- Shut up and listen.

946
01:32:48,981 --> 01:32:52,192
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

947
01:32:52,193 --> 01:32:54,150
They'll have to stay here,
but they'll be safe.

948
01:32:54,195 --> 01:32:56,413
- And Han?
- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

949
01:32:56,447 --> 01:32:58,970
- Vader wants us all dead.
- He doesn't want you at all.

950
01:32:58,991 --> 01:33:02,494
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

951
01:33:02,495 --> 01:33:05,147
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
- And we're the bait.

952
01:33:05,164 --> 01:33:07,077
- He's on his way.
- Perfect.

953
01:33:07,959 --> 01:33:10,264
You fixed us all real good,
didn't you?

954
01:33:10,294 --> 01:33:11,512
My friend.

955
01:33:14,466 --> 01:33:15,728
Stop!

956
01:33:16,968 --> 01:33:19,228
I've done all I can.

957
01:33:19,262 --> 01:33:21,784
Sorry I couldn't do better,
but I got my own problems.

958
01:33:21,806 --> 01:33:23,154
Yeah.

959
01:33:23,224 --> 01:33:25,137
You're a real hero.

960
01:33:35,861 --> 01:33:38,427
You certainly
have a way with people.

961
01:33:52,713 --> 01:33:54,626
This facility is crude...

962
01:33:54,673 --> 01:33:57,885
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

963
01:33:57,886 --> 01:34:00,233
for his journey to the emperor.

964
01:34:00,261 --> 01:34:03,389
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

965
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:06,912
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.

966
01:34:08,312 --> 01:34:13,150
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing. It might kill him.

967
01:34:13,151 --> 01:34:16,151
I do not want
the emperor's prize damaged.

968
01:34:16,153 --> 01:34:19,371
We will test it on Captain Solo.

969
01:34:43,014 --> 01:34:47,351
If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't
be in this ridiculous position.

970
01:34:47,352 --> 01:34:50,135
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me...

971
01:34:50,147 --> 01:34:51,930
so don't do anything foolish.

972
01:35:05,955 --> 01:35:08,085
What's going on, buddy?

973
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:11,131
You're being put into carbon freeze.

974
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:14,796
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

975
01:35:14,797 --> 01:35:18,320
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

976
01:35:22,137 --> 01:35:23,355
Chewbacca, stop!

977
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:25,517
No, Chewie, stop!

978
01:35:25,557 --> 01:35:28,685
You're going to get us all killed!
Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.

979
01:35:28,686 --> 01:35:30,729
Hey! Hey!
Listen to me.

980
01:35:30,771 --> 01:35:33,381
Chewie, this won't help me.

981
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:36,096
Hey, save your strength.
There'll be another time.

982
01:35:37,862 --> 01:35:39,557
The princess.

983
01:35:39,613 --> 01:35:41,440
You have to take care of her.

984
01:35:43,618 --> 01:35:45,705
Do you hear me?

985
01:35:59,509 --> 01:36:02,597
- I love you.
- I know.

986
01:36:31,667 --> 01:36:35,406
What's going on?
Turn round. I can't see.

987
01:37:34,147 --> 01:37:36,279
They've encased him in carbonite.

988
01:37:36,316 --> 01:37:38,273
He should be quite
well-protected...

989
01:37:38,318 --> 01:37:40,319
if he survived
the freezing process, that is.

990
01:37:40,362 --> 01:37:42,971
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

991
01:37:42,991 --> 01:37:44,686
Yes, he's alive.

992
01:37:45,492 --> 01:37:47,450
And in perfect hibernation.

993
01:37:48,329 --> 01:37:50,547
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

994
01:37:51,332 --> 01:37:53,115
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

995
01:37:55,461 --> 01:37:57,376
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

996
01:37:57,422 --> 01:38:01,466
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

997
01:38:05,555 --> 01:38:07,512
Calrissian...

998
01:38:07,557 --> 01:38:10,079
take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

999
01:38:10,101 --> 01:38:12,319
You said they'd be left
under my supervision.

1000
01:38:12,354 --> 01:38:14,484
I am altering the deal.

1001
01:38:14,522 --> 01:38:17,348
Pray I don't alter it any further.

1002
01:39:54,499 --> 01:39:57,152
Luke, don't! It's a trap!

1003
01:39:58,545 --> 01:39:59,676
It's a trap!

1004
01:40:46,053 --> 01:40:48,531
The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.

1005
01:40:50,849 --> 01:40:52,980
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1006
01:41:54,914 --> 01:41:56,611
Well done.

1007
01:41:58,333 --> 01:42:01,248
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet.

1008
01:42:01,254 --> 01:42:02,993
Move.

1009
01:42:07,385 --> 01:42:10,805
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're getting out of here.

1010
01:42:10,806 --> 01:42:12,632
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1011
01:42:12,683 --> 01:42:15,640
Do you think that
after what you did to Han...

1012
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,939
- I had no choice.
- What are you doing? Trust him!

1013
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:23,067
We understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1014
01:42:23,068 --> 01:42:24,678
I'm just trying to help.

1015
01:42:24,737 --> 01:42:27,475
We don't need any of your help.

1016
01:42:32,494 --> 01:42:34,060
What?

1017
01:42:34,122 --> 01:42:38,906
- It sounds like Han.
- There's still a chance to save Han...

1018
01:42:39,668 --> 01:42:43,061
at the east... platform.

1019
01:42:47,134 --> 01:42:49,352
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1020
01:42:49,386 --> 01:42:51,213
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1021
01:42:52,098 --> 01:42:54,881
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

1022
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:12,339
R2, where have you been?

1023
01:43:12,369 --> 01:43:14,326
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1024
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:18,326
Hurry! We're trying to save
Han from the bounty hunter.

1025
01:43:20,962 --> 01:43:23,483
Well, at least
you're still in one piece.

1026
01:43:23,505 --> 01:43:25,940
Look what's happened to me.

1027
01:43:37,811 --> 01:43:40,507
Oh, no!
Chewie, they're behind you!

1028
01:43:53,369 --> 01:43:55,804
You have learned much, young one.

1029
01:43:55,829 --> 01:43:58,047
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1030
01:44:09,552 --> 01:44:12,770
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1031
01:44:13,514 --> 01:44:16,081
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1032
01:44:24,066 --> 01:44:25,458
All too easy.

1033
01:44:30,657 --> 01:44:33,223
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the emperor thought.

1034
01:44:36,288 --> 01:44:37,985
Impressive.

1035
01:44:39,875 --> 01:44:41,354
Most impressive.

1036
01:44:49,176 --> 01:44:53,002
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You have controlled your fear.

1037
01:44:55,642 --> 01:44:58,976
Now, release your anger.

1038
01:44:58,977 --> 01:45:01,673
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1039
01:47:12,531 --> 01:47:14,532
The security code
has been changed.

1040
01:47:14,575 --> 01:47:18,010
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1041
01:47:18,829 --> 01:47:20,611
R2, hurry.

1042
01:47:23,833 --> 01:47:26,225
<i>Attention.
This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.</i>

1043
01:47:26,253 --> 01:47:28,297
<i>The Empire has taken control
of the city.</i>

1044
01:47:28,339 --> 01:47:31,296
<i>I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.</i>

1045
01:47:37,682 --> 01:47:39,377
This way.

1046
01:47:39,433 --> 01:47:41,738
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1047
01:47:41,770 --> 01:47:44,771
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1048
01:48:06,252 --> 01:48:09,296
<i>We're not interested in the hyperdrive
on the Falcon. It's fixed!</i>

1049
01:48:14,177 --> 01:48:17,091
Just open the door,
you stupid lump!

1050
01:48:25,564 --> 01:48:28,086
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!

1051
01:48:52,508 --> 01:48:55,335
That hurts! Bend down,
you thoughtless... Ow!

1052
01:49:02,352 --> 01:49:03,787
Go!

1053
01:49:10,152 --> 01:49:13,065
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1054
01:49:13,071 --> 01:49:15,028
Of course I've looked better.

1055
01:50:08,628 --> 01:50:12,422
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.

1056
01:50:12,423 --> 01:50:16,076
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1057
01:50:31,735 --> 01:50:33,430
There is no escape.

1058
01:50:34,237 --> 01:50:36,455
Don't make me destroy you.

1059
01:50:40,368 --> 01:50:43,238
You do not yet realize
your importance.

1060
01:50:43,247 --> 01:50:46,031
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1061
01:50:46,041 --> 01:50:47,955
Join me...

1062
01:50:48,002 --> 01:50:50,480
and I will complete your training.

1063
01:50:50,504 --> 01:50:52,983
With our combined strength...

1064
01:50:53,006 --> 01:50:56,051
we can end
this destructive conflict...

1065
01:50:56,052 --> 01:50:58,444
and bring order to the galaxy.

1066
01:50:58,471 --> 01:51:01,080
I'll never join you!

1067
01:51:01,098 --> 01:51:05,309
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

1068
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:09,648
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1069
01:51:09,649 --> 01:51:11,128
He told me enough.

1070
01:51:13,694 --> 01:51:15,607
He told me you killed him.

1071
01:51:17,324 --> 01:51:19,497
I am your father.

1072
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,960
That's not true.

1073
01:51:30,753 --> 01:51:32,450
That's impossible!

1074
01:51:32,506 --> 01:51:35,897
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1075
01:51:44,601 --> 01:51:48,853
You can destroy the emperor.
He has foreseen this.

1076
01:51:48,855 --> 01:51:51,856
It is your destiny.

1077
01:51:51,858 --> 01:51:53,642
Join me...

1078
01:51:53,694 --> 01:51:58,174
and together we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.

1079
01:52:08,625 --> 01:52:10,322
Come with me.

1080
01:52:11,129 --> 01:52:13,390
It is the only way.

1081
01:53:19,573 --> 01:53:21,009
Ben.

1082
01:53:21,825 --> 01:53:23,740
Ben, please.

1083
01:53:51,606 --> 01:53:53,259
Hear me.

1084
01:54:00,156 --> 01:54:02,287
- We've got to go back.
- What?

1085
01:54:02,326 --> 01:54:04,761
- I know where Luke is.
- What about those fighters?

1086
01:54:05,787 --> 01:54:08,135
Chewie, just do it.

1087
01:54:08,164 --> 01:54:09,947
All right, all right!

1088
01:54:18,092 --> 01:54:22,310
Alert my Stardestroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1089
01:54:32,690 --> 01:54:34,822
Look, someone's up there.

1090
01:54:35,984 --> 01:54:38,551
It's Luke.
Chewie, slow down.

1091
01:54:38,571 --> 01:54:42,006
We'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

1092
01:54:57,799 --> 01:55:00,235
Okay. Easy, Chewie.

1093
01:55:21,906 --> 01:55:24,124
<i>- Lando?
- Okay, let's go.</i>

1094
01:55:44,097 --> 01:55:45,576
All right, Chewie. Let's go.

1095
01:56:21,093 --> 01:56:23,006
I'll be back.

1096
01:56:28,683 --> 01:56:30,118
Stardestroyer.

1097
01:56:35,316 --> 01:56:37,881
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

1098
01:56:37,902 --> 01:56:40,032
If your people fixed the hyperdrive.

1099
01:56:40,070 --> 01:56:42,505
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1100
01:56:42,531 --> 01:56:44,053
Punch it!

1101
01:56:54,668 --> 01:56:57,059
They told me they fixed it.

1102
01:56:57,086 --> 01:56:59,044
I trusted them!

1103
01:56:59,088 --> 01:57:01,698
It's not my fault!

1104
01:57:07,223 --> 01:57:09,963
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1105
01:57:09,976 --> 01:57:13,645
<i>Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon?</i>

1106
01:57:13,646 --> 01:57:15,734
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.

1107
01:57:15,773 --> 01:57:19,525
Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

1108
01:57:19,526 --> 01:57:22,658
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1109
01:57:24,114 --> 01:57:27,534
Noisy brute. Why don't we
just go into light speed?

1110
01:57:27,535 --> 01:57:29,187
We can't?

1111
01:57:29,246 --> 01:57:31,724
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1112
01:57:34,918 --> 01:57:37,919
The city's central computer told you?

1113
01:57:37,921 --> 01:57:40,791
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1114
01:57:40,798 --> 01:57:44,234
Ouch! Pay attention
to what you're doing.

1115
01:57:56,398 --> 01:57:57,616
Father.

1116
01:57:59,443 --> 01:58:01,662
Son, come with me.

1117
01:58:04,615 --> 01:58:06,093
Ben.

1118
01:58:07,118 --> 01:58:09,292
Why didn't you tell me?

1119
01:58:27,430 --> 01:58:28,691
It's Vader.

1120
01:58:34,478 --> 01:58:38,219
Luke, it is your destiny.

1121
01:58:45,782 --> 01:58:48,131
Why didn't you tell me?

1122
01:58:54,332 --> 01:58:58,420
Alert all commands.
Ready for the tractor beam.

1123
01:59:01,715 --> 01:59:04,585
R2, come back at once!
You haven't finished with me yet.

1124
01:59:04,593 --> 01:59:08,220
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.

1125
01:59:08,221 --> 01:59:12,832
I'm standing here in pieces
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1126
01:59:15,813 --> 01:59:17,334
You did it!

1127
02:00:14,998 --> 02:00:18,130
<i>- Luke, we're ready for take-off.
- Good luck, Lando.</i>

1128
02:00:19,043 --> 02:00:23,131
<i>When we find Jabba the Hutt and
that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.</i>

1129
02:00:23,132 --> 02:00:25,871
I'll meet you at
the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1130
02:00:25,885 --> 02:00:29,429
Princess, we'll find Han.
I promise.

1131
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:31,734
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.

1132
02:00:31,765 --> 02:00:33,548
Take care, you two.

1133
02:00:33,601 --> 02:00:35,731
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>
