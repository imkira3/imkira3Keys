Mother!

3

Mother!

4
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,089
Moth... <i>(gasps)</i>

5
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,499
Your mother
can't be with you anymore.

6
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:01,562
Come.

7
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:39,643
- Friend Owl.
- Excuse me, sir.

8
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:42,202
I hope I'm not intruding, but...

9
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,215
well, I... I just had to come.

10
00:01:46,885 --> 00:01:49,410
Poor little fellow.

11
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:52,479
So young to be without his mother.

12
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,889
Well, if I can be of any help...

13
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,021
Wait.

14
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,829
I could use your help.

15
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:07,201
Find me a suitable doe to raise Bambi.

16
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:11,299
Oh, oh, yes.
Of course, yes.

17
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,867
Food's so scarce.

18
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:17,346
Does can barely feed themselves.

19
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,884
Perhaps you could...

20
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:25,616
Me? You know as well as I do,
a prince looks after the herd.

21
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,487
Does care for the young.

22
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:33,156
But you are his father,
and circumstances being what they are...

23
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,168
- Until spring.
- Oh, excellent.

24
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,971
After all, who better
to raise the young prince

25
00:02:46,044 --> 00:02:48,877
than the great prince himself?

Bambi, a prince awakens

- What was what?
<i>- (Stomach rumbles)</i>

58

I-I guess it was my stomach.

you don't like it if you've never tried it?

Come along. We have to check

- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
- Bam...

Bambi!

72
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:03,558
A prince does not whoo-hoo.

73
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:06,569
- He doesn't?
- He certainly does not.

74
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:09,800
A prince maintains control at all times.

75
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:13,503
Display dignity.
Walk with pride.

Whoa!

89

Don't you think it'd be better
if we got a little closer?

90
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:36,617
The distance
makes it easier to spot danger.

91
00:08:36,694 --> 00:08:38,821
<i>(Bambi)</i> Hm.

92
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:42,423
But it sure makes it
harder to play with them.

93
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,868
Play is a healthy part
of a young deer's development.

94
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:50,203
- Is that so?
- Mm-hm. Mother says so.

95
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:53,869
- One time, Mother and I were out...
- Bambi.

96
00:08:53,945 --> 00:08:57,403
- A fawn came over and wanted to play...
- Bambi.

97
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,114
I think it's best
to leave the past in the past.

98
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:07,851
A prince does not look back,
only ahead.

Oh. Yes, sir.

100

Now, come. We still have a lot
of ground to cover today.

Don't fall behind.

Uh-uh.

00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:26,364
I think he's over there.
Look, look.

Oh, OK.

114

- Gotcha!
- Argh!

116

Mama says you're gonna
take us to see the groundhog.

What she says goes.

00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:49,622
Well, she's not the boss of me.

Yes.
But if he doesn't...

175

Now, what seems to be the problem?

I'm afraid to go out there.
I'll see my shadow.

Hello, Bambi.

Hi, Faline.

- I almost didn't recognize you.
- Really?

183

Um, well...

My nerves just can't take it anymore.

193

- More winter.

194

More hibernating.

195

It looks like
I scared the shadow right out of him.

208

Forest on fire?

Who are you?

Name's Ronno,

Well, I hope the three of you
have a nice day.

215

I wouldn't go that way if I were you.

216
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,922
That's where I saw a man.

217

You saw a man?

218

Uh-huh.

219

There I was, out in the meadow.

220
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:45,137
Suddenly I heard this voice
luring me in.

221
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:48,975
"I'm here, I'm here."

222
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:55,213
See, man's got this stick that can
make his voice sound like one of us.

223
00:17:55,285 --> 00:17:58,049
But I'm way too smart for that,

224
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:00,784
so I crept up on him...

225
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:03,019
real quiet.

226
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:09,794
Then bam!
I knocked him out with my trusty antlers.

00:47:11,907 --> 00:47:14,137
Mother's resting now, isn't she?

643
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:15,938
Oh, I forgot.

644
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:20,505
A prince leaves the past
in the past, right?

645
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:26,687
That's enough questions for today.

646
00:47:26,755 --> 00:47:28,552
Now, please get some sleep.

647
00:47:28,624 --> 00:47:30,615
OK.

648
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,357
Good night.

649
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:14,432
Grrr!

650
00:48:15,737 --> 00:48:17,728
<i>(yawning)</i>

651
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,836
<i>(Bambi)</i> Come on, sleepyhead.

652
00:48:20,909 --> 00:48:25,369
Remind me never to let you
eat blossoms before bedtime.

653
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:27,540
Wait. I hear trouble.

654
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:29,243
- What? What?
<i>- (Buzzing)</i>

655
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:31,718
Hornet nest - antler-high.

656
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:35,086
Very good.

657
00:48:35,157 --> 00:48:38,957
- Wait! Now I see trouble.
- Where? Where?

658
00:48:39,027 --> 00:48:41,325
Rival stag, dead ahead.

659
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:44,490
Ah, he's pretty small.
Shouldn't be any trouble.

660
00:48:44,566 --> 00:48:47,626
Oh, yeah?
I can be plenty of trouble.

661
00:48:47,703 --> 00:48:51,036
- No, not you.
- Yes, me.

662
00:48:51,106 --> 00:48:52,130
Yah!

663
00:48:52,207 --> 00:48:55,802
Now you've had it. <i>(Laughs)</i>

664
00:48:55,878 --> 00:48:56,970
Gotcha!

665
00:48:57,045 --> 00:48:59,240
Now who's got who?

666
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:04,282
- There you two are. Well, yes.
- Hello, Friend Owl.

667
00:49:04,353 --> 00:49:06,321
Well, he-hello.

668
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:09,448
I've... I've been
meaning to speak to you.

669
00:49:09,525 --> 00:49:13,256
I've been looking everywhere.
I thought you'd be by the meadow now.

670
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:16,092
I'm afraid I got a little...

671
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:18,427
distracted.

672
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,096
So I see. Well, no matter.
I usually find what I'm after.

673
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:27,835
Speaking of which,
there's someone I'd like you to meet.

674
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:30,538
- Mena.
- Great Prince.

675
00:49:30,612 --> 00:49:33,137
- Bambi, go to the den.
- Bambi.

676
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:37,208
I've heard so much about you. You know,
your mama and I grew up together.

677
00:49:37,286 --> 00:49:39,345
- You did?
- Go to the den.

678
00:49:39,421 --> 00:49:41,184
But I want to hear about Mother.

679
00:49:41,256 --> 00:49:45,192
There'll be plenty of time for that
once you're settled in your new home.

680
00:49:47,229 --> 00:49:49,060
You're sending me away?

681
00:49:49,131 --> 00:49:51,565
No. Just...
just let me explain.

682
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:53,828
But I did everything you said.

683
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:57,736
- I even heard with my hooves.
- Bambi, a prince does not...

684
00:49:57,806 --> 00:50:00,866
- That's all you care about - not me.
- Don't speak to me...

685
00:50:00,943 --> 00:50:04,276
I wish Mother was here instead of you!

686
00:50:06,615 --> 00:50:11,746
Oh, my, my, my. Well, I've certainly
made a muddle of things.

687
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,845
No. This is my fault.

688
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:17,153
Bambi needs a mother.

689
00:50:17,225 --> 00:50:20,717
A prince should not be raising a child.

690
00:50:28,136 --> 00:50:30,764
I'm sure gonna miss you guys.

691
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:33,535
Don't worry.
We'll see each other again.

692
00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:34,609
Uh-huh.

693
00:50:34,676 --> 00:50:38,112
We'll come visit you, if it's not too far.

694
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,980
- But Mama says it is too far.
- Shh!

695
00:50:42,818 --> 00:50:48,222
And if you get scared, just be scarier
than whatever's scaring you.

696
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,053
Grrr!

697
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:52,320
Bambi.

698
00:50:52,394 --> 00:50:54,259
It's time to go.

699
00:50:54,329 --> 00:50:56,991
I'll never forget any of you.

700
00:50:57,065 --> 00:51:01,934
Of course not.
Can't forget your bestest friend.

701
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,834
Being a prince means sacrifice.

702
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:11,378
He must ignore his feelings

703
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:14,347
and do what is best for others.

704
00:51:15,217 --> 00:51:17,811
Do you understand?

705
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,084
I'll visit you soon.

706
00:51:21,156 --> 00:51:22,953
Be good for Mena.

707
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:29,223
And never forget...

708
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:32,266
you are the prince.

You're not leaving
without saying goodbye?

Ah, and I thought we were pals.

713
00:52:50,612 --> 00:52:53,513
I feel for you.
Gosh, I really do.

714
00:52:53,582 --> 00:52:57,245
It's gotta be hard to have a father
that's so ashamed of you

715
00:52:57,319 --> 00:52:59,549
that he'd give you away.

716

Oh, yeah?

It was raining and thundering.

It didn't look good for the young prince.

765

There were thousands of dogs,

There was nowhere to go.
