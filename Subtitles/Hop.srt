Look, Dad, (CLEARS THROAT)

161
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,820
ever since I was
yea big, it's been,

162
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,022
"The Easrer Bunny
wouldn't do that" and

163
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,361
"The Easter Bunny
has to be perfect."

164
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,659
But I'm not perfect.

165
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,283
I know that, Son.
But you'II get there,
eventually.

166
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,579

Just maybe, maybe I'm this.

A sock? (SNIFFS)

171
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,797
Ugh.

172
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,966
Yeah, that's right.
I might be
a metaphorical sock.

173
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,177
I might not be
a good enough egg,

but I mighr be
the best sock ever.

175
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,061
I might not cut it
delivering Easter baskets,

176
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,480
but I might be
great at something else.

Oh, the drums!
Why, I think that's fine.

I think ir's really
nice that you have a hobby.
Everyone should have a hobby.

179
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,647
It's not a hobby, Dad.

180
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:31,072
I want to drum in a band.
I want to see the world.

But, for all
those that do believe,
you will be there.

191
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,313
No, Dad. I don't want
to be the Easter Bunny.

You are going to
be the Easter Bunny!

No, Fred.
You don't '"swing by.'"

00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,876
My boss is on
vacation for a few weeks
and he asked me to house-sit.

246
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,676
Nobody ever asks
me to house-sit.

247
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,219
I know.
It's so weird.

Anyway, he has dogs,

249
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,095
and you know I'm
scared of dogs,
so take over for me.

00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,596
Wait.
Your boss Iives in
a big mansion, right?

Yes, in Beverly Hills.

252
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,936
And he Ioves his house
more than he loves his kids.

253
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,892
So you have
to behave. Okay?

254
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,943
Do not touch anything.
Do not break anything.

to feed the dogs.

Is that a problem?.

626
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,587
No, no, I love mail.
I get lots of mail.

627
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,256
E-mail,
snail mail, chain mail.

628
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,265
I am male.
(LAUGHS)

629
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,141
Speaking of mail,
that's Cody. Let me
introduce you to him.

630
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,892
He is being promoted to
junior exec and you would
be replacing him.

631
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,476
Wow. Congratulations.

632
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,647
Question.

633
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,987
I need 30 copies
of something, collated,
stapled, bound

634
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,652
and on my desk
by yesterday.

635
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,274
What do you do?

636
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,324
I would make 30 copies,
and I would do what
you said with them.

637
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,247
(SNIFFS)

638
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,330
I smell potential.

639
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,792
Oh, Mrs. Beck, I was
wanting to talk
to you about my Iunch.

640
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,462
(WHISPERING)
Fred. Fred!

641
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:49,884
What is wrong with you?

642
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,802
This is
an extreme emergency.

643
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,759
You're ruining this for me.
You really need to go.

644
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,636
You're righr.
I'll create a diversion

645
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,641
and ee'II escape in
the ensuing chaos.

646
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,850
E.B., no! Get back here!

647
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,095
Fred?.
Yeah.

648
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,147
I got a good
feeling abour this place.
Where to next?.

649
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,820
(BLUES MUSIC PLAYING)

650
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:28,169
Sounding good to me.
But where is Ricky?.

651
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,591
We need to put
a back beat behind that.

652
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,713
A back beat.

653
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,552
I think Ricky
went out for coffee.

654
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,670
(DRUMS PLAYING)

655
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,935
I guess he's back.
How you feeling, Ricky?

656
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,307
Yeah, I'm smashing.

657
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,060
(IN DEEP VOICE)
I mean, I'm fine.
I'm just fine, daddy-o.

(SCATTING)

659
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,401
Well, then let's do it.

(SONG RESUMES)

661
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,541
Okay, so this our sport...

662
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,508
Oh.

663
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,512
This is our sports-game
motion-capture studio.

664
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,679
Mmm-hmm.

665
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,390
In here?.
Yeah.

666
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,515
Ah!
Hockey.

667
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,229
It's golf.

668
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,600
And this is our
sound recording studio
for our music games.

669
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,819
We've done
Extreme Rock Master,
Extreme jazz Master,

670
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,568
and now we're doing
Extreme Blues Master.

671
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,733
Sounds like a cool idea.

672
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:40,863
Whoa,
you got the Blind Boys of...

673
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,787
(SOFTLY) Quit it!
I'm going to kill you
so bad! Get out!

674
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,834
Okay, Fred,
Iet's try and keep moving...

675
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,758
I'm all of a sudden
not feeling so good.
Oh.

676
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,714
Do you have a restroom?
Yeah.

677
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:56,885
Where is thar?

678
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,907
(IN OWN VOICE)
That was brilliant!

679
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,326
(IN DEEP VOICE)
I mean, that was tight.

680
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:25,157
Sounded all right.
But I know my
drummer when I hear him.

681
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,288
So, who are you, boy?

682
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,787
Okay, I admit it.
I'm not a blues man.
My name is E.B.

683
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,584
I'm just some
guy off the street

wirh two sticks of
wood and a dream.

685
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,920
I understand if
you throw me out.

686
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,468
I get it if you don't
want to give me a break.

687
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,133
Hey, slow down, friend.

688
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:43,349
You know, we have a buddy
who is always on
the lookout for new talent.

689
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:47,847
And the man is a genius.
He is the godfather
of entertainment.

690
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,472
And he's having
auditions tomorrow.

691
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,934
The Hoff?
You mean he can help me?

692
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,269
If he like you.

693
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,820
Wow. Thanks, Blind Boys.

00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,694
Good Iuck, Iittle rabbit.

695
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,117
Wait,
how did you know I was...

00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:03,490
Mmm!

E.B.:
So, Fred, how'd it go?

699
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,826
FRED:
Don't say a word.

(GRUNTING)

701
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,883
FRED: Can I get a Iittle
clarification, here?

702
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,471
Is this what
the Easter Bunny does now?

703
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,674
He just goes house to house,
messing up people's Iives?

704
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,347
Well, that
is just hurtful.

705
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,686
Besides, you're
selling yourself short.

706
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,976
They were going to
shove you in the mail room.

707
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,228
Well, excuse me,
but I happen to think
you're better than that.

708
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,568
You don't know me, okay?
We just met.

709
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,735
I can tell.
You give off this aura
of untapped potential.

710
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,816
I do?

711
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,035
Don't pull that
with me, rabbit, okay?
I'm too smart for you.

712
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,779
But, Fred, I'm serious.

713
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,536
You're destined to
do something great.
I just know it.

714
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:50,912
I've heard rhat one before.

715
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,081
You'll find an awesome job.

716
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,375
Hey. Look, what about this?

717
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,172
Dog walker?
No.

718
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,875
TSA Officer?.
No.

719
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,461
What about this one?
It looks exciting.

720
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:04,343
Wind in your hair,
hot babe on your arm.

721
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,181
That's a car ad.

722
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,726
You should buy that car, then.

723
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:12,893

Ah! Señor.
How you doing, jefe?.

726
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,564
Am I disturbing?

727
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,401
It's never been
this quiet in here.

728
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,156
Yeah, it's so depressing.

729
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:30,285
You should clear this out.
Make a new den or a clubhouse.

730
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:33,080
Like a man-cave!
It'll be fun.

731
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,078
I called his
dreams ridiculous.

732
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,422
What kind of
father does that?.

733
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:39,791
No, no, señor.

734
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,464
I will not permit you
to beat yourself up over this.

735
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:45,589
Anybody would be lucky
to have a father such as you.

736
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,973
Thank you, Carlos.
I miss him.

737
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,467
Me, too, señor.

738
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,220
A son is very
difficult to replace.

739
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:56,604
Difficult, but
not impossible.

740
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,985
Carlos...

741
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,147
What the...
What's that on your head?

742
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,441
What?. My new earmuffs?

743
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,777
It's a cold spring
this year, you know? Brr!

744
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:09,658
Oh.

745
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,781
Anyway, what am I going to do?

746
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,624
I know,
how can you deliver Easter

747
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,745
with this tremendous burden
on your old, frail shoulders?.

748
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,830
Hey, hey,
hey, easy
with the "old."

749
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,957
No, I'm just saying,
like, compared to me.

750
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,751
Surely you're not thinking
of making the trip yourself?

751
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,881
What choice
do we have?

752
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,008
We can improvise. I mean...

753
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,260
Does it even
have to be a bunny?
Whar?

754
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:34,517
I suppose,
given these troubled times,

755
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,270
even a humble
chick could do the job.

756
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,775
(LAUGHING)

757
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,649
Really, Carlos.

758
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,446
(LAUGHING AWKWARDLY)

759
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,983
Wow. I mean,
that is funny.

760
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,322
Can you imagine that?.
A chick delivering Easter?

761
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:50,657
That's ridiculous.

762
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,238
Oh, dear me.

763
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,745
But I appreciare
you trying to
cheer me up, though.

764
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,793
Please. It is my pleasure
to amuse you, señor.

765
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,962
(LAUGHING)
A chick delivering...

766
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,674
Fred, I was wondering if...

767
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,551
Are you doing
anything tomorrow?

768
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,725
Tomorrow I get to
start my new job
at the video game company.

769
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,515
Wait a second.
No, that didn't work out.

770
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,688
I know. I know.
I'm sorry about that.

771
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:25,195
But do you know whar?
Every cloud has
a silver Iining.

772
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,691
And behold this
silver lining, Fred!

773
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:32,949
The Hoff?

774
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,746
Yes, please.
I just need a ride.

775
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:35,864
Mmm.

776
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,579
No.
Come on, Fred.

777
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:40,704
This iS my one big chance.
I'll do anything.

778
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,373
Even get out of your life.

779
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,713
I take you to
Hoff Knows Talent,
and that's it, we're done.

780
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,590
Bunny's honor.

00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:53,762
Right here, mate.

782
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,634
It's okay.
A verbal agreement is fine.

783
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,641
Now, you realize,
you can't talk.

784
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,222
No. I can.

785
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,433
No, what I mean is,
you shouldn't talk.

786
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,106
What? Like, ever?

787
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,444
Yeah,
"ever" would be wonderful.

788
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,564
But from now on,
especially not in
front of other people.

789
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,778
They might freak out
and want to
dissect your brain.

790
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,775
Dissect? That's
a bit extreme.

791
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,948
There's an easy explanation
as to why I can talk.

792
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,867
It's a simple combination
of cuteness and magic.

793
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,370
Okay. Here we go. One BLT.

794
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:22,329
And one order of
carrot cake a Ia mode,
topped with, quote,

795
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,415
Whatever candy you have
Iaying around back there.
Unquote.

796
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:26,958
Uh, excuse me.

797
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,134
Is that a cough drop?

798
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,426
Yeah. It's cherry.
It counts.

799
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,465
It's a peculiar garnish.

800
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,308
Can I get some
chocolate syrup?

801
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,723
Sure, doll.

802
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:40,771
E.B.:
Thanks, Iove.

803
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,609
It seems my brain is
still intact, Fred.

804
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,820
E.B.: Fred,
I've just had an idea.

805
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,362
When I'm a famous rock srar,
I'm going to buy
a mansion just Iike this

806
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:55,786
and make you
sleep in the garage
in a topsy-turvy switcheroo.

807
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,615
What do you think?
Oh, man. My sister is here.

808
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,124
You never told me
you had a sister.

809
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,918
There's still so much
we don't know
about each other, Fred.

810
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,586
If she goes upstairs,
I'm dead.

811
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,958
Why?
Why?.

812
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,130
Let me take you
back to this morning

813
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,958
when you flooded
the bathroom and
you trashed the bedroom.

814
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,088
You remember thar?

815
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,171
Fred, leave this to me.
I'll smooth ir out with her.
Ow!

816
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,298
Hey!
Look at me.

817
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,309
One word out of you,
and it's rabbit season.
You got it?

818
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,309
Okay, I'm going to
run interference.

Hi!

Hey, it's not a good

I was just Ieaving.

823
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,658
But you just got here.

824
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:36,823
I know, right?

825
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,868
Hey, what are these?
Oh!

826
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,996
There you are.
(CHUCKLES) Mmm!

827
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,123
I'm on this North Beach diet.
It's carrots only.

828
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,829
That is why rhey're
all over the house.

829
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,668
I was going to
clean them up, though.

830
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,500
Okay, Fred,
how did the interview go?
Yes?.

831
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,086
Oh! Thank you for asking.
Amazing! I aced it.

832

Yeah.

Why are you so surprised?

Fred, that's awesome!
PIace could use me, too.

Don't get me wrong,
it was great.
It was good.

It was all right.

if it was for me, really.
It just didn't gel.

about the whole thing.

Oh! What? What happened?

842
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:18,119
It's kind of hard ro pinpoint
any one specific thing.

allowed up there, either.
Don't go up there!

So cute!
Isn't he?

858
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,376
Yeah, you know whar?
Maybe we shouldn't
be playing with him

859
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,049
because we're not really
supposed to be up here in
the first place. So...

860
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,922

before things
get uncomfortable?.

No, I'm not uncomfortable.

Well, I'm
uncomfortable because
I'm Iooking after the house

the very scope...

938
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:50,090
Cut to the chase, my friend.

939
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,805
Okay. Uh...

940
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,476

Stop, stop.

946
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,285
I don't want to hear anymore.

947
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,043
Come on! Mr. Hoff,
we've been waiting all day.
Give the guy a chance.

948
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,882
I gave him a chance.

949
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,839
I didn'r like it.

950
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,171
I loved it!

951
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,716
Woohoo!
Yes!

952
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:17,386
Hoff knows talent,
and that rabbit's got talent!

953
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,596
Thank you, David Hasselhoff!

954
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,394
I will not let you down.

955
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:25,236
This is a golden opporrunity
and one I intend
to realize fully!

956
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,899
Hey, wait.

957
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,897
You're not surprised
that I'm a talking rabbit.

958
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,777
Little man, my best
friend's a talking car.

959
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:40,121
Can you make it
to a Iive taping
of the show Saturday night?.

960
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,744
I'll send a limo.

961
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:43,871
Did you hear him?.
Did you hear The Hoff?

962
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,172
I'm on my way, Fred!

963
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,124
It sounds like
The Hoff really dug you.

964
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,219
I mean, he is a good acror,
but I think he was sincere.

965
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,130
Thanks, mate.
And don't think I've
forgotten our deal.

966
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:55,007
You've done your part.

967
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,593
And now I'm ready to
get out of your life.

968
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,935
Good. Yeah, good.

969
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,435
We've had some
good times, eh?.
Haven't we, Fred?

970
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,278
Yeah, there were a few.

971
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,115
You validared my
whole childhood dream.

972
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,033
And then, what else?.
(GASPS)

973
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,038
Let me think.
Good times.

974
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,999
Well, maybe jusr one
good time. But the
main thing is

975
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:24,211
I got to meet the guy
on my second grade lunchbox.

976
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,288

Psst! Fred!

What are you doing?

982
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,388
Pink Berers.
Pink what?.

983
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,018
Pink Berers.

984
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,517
There is nobody here.
Oh yes, there is.

985
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,814
If they see me,
rhey'll take me
back to Easter lsland

986
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,192
and I'll never get
my chance to drum!

987
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,737
Pink Berets? Huh?.
Sounds super fierce.

988
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,488
Don't be fooled by
their adorable name.

989
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:58,491
They're the Easter
Bunny's Royal Guard!

990
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,872
But you're the Easter Bunny!
Aren't you?

991
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,869
Of course I am, technically.

992
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:06,995
What do you mean,
"technically"?.

993
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,172
I'll explain Iater.
Just get in the car.

994
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,762
Look, I was supposed
to take over this year,
but I ran away.

995
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,260
What are you, crazy?

996
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:23,728
Who wouldn'r want to
be the Easter Bunny?

997
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,097
That's, like,
the greatest job ever!

998
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:28,275
Yeah, you'd think so.
But it's what my
dad wants, not me.

999
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,946
He expects so much.
What's lefr for me to do
but let him down?

1000
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:33,776
Sounds familiar.

1001
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,525
Sometimes fathers
just don't get it.

1002
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,202
He told me I only
ever think of myself.

1003
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,280
Other times,
they hit the nail
right on the head.

1004
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,785
Come on, Fred.

1005
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,867
I know we said
we'd go our own
separate ways,

1006
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,543
but please,
you've got to protect me.

1007

Look, I'm sorry,

1008
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,629
but I can't really
leave you places,

1009
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,665
I can't really
take you places.

1010
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,375
And I've got to go to
my sister's play tonight.

1011
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,586
Oh, I Iike plays.

1012
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,839
We should go see a play
that my sister's not in

1013
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,549
and that my family will
not be attending.

1014
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,051
I understand.

1015
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,722
Just drop me off
ar the bus station.
I'm sure I'll be fine.

01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:20,316
one reason not to
be disappointed?

1095
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,609
Well...

1096
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,987
Just one.
Yeah.

1097
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,946
Fred?

1098
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:36,704
Fred, where'd you go?

1099
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,576
Yeah, I'm right here.

1100
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:43,587
I jusr remembered
I have a really great
solid Iead, actually.

1101
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,208
You do?
Yeah, a great job.

1102
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,756
Tell me about it.
I can't really
tell you about it.

1103
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,211
But it's big.
You're going to Iove it.

1104
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,631
It's really big!

E.B.: Hey, what's with
rhe "Mr. Serious"
all of a sudden?

1106
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,639
Wait, is this where
you tell me you
want to see other rabbits?

1107
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,974
Because I'm
open-minded, Fred.

1108
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:06,856
E.B., I have
the most amazing idea.

1109
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:09,858
When I was a kid,
I told everyone

1110
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,446
that I saw
the Easter Bunny, right?

1111
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,028
No one believed me,

1112
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,530
even though

1113
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:18,371
he left me this.

1114
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:22,211
This chocolate bunny,
which I kept.

1115
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,164
Oh, dear.

1116
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:27,671
And tonight, it just hit me.

1117
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,838
I realized that it was
my destiny to see him.

1118
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,554
Just like it was my
destiny to meet you.

1119
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,642
It's all been
leading up to this.

1120
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:37,765
Up to what?

1121
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:39,934
You don't want to be
the Easter Bunny, right?

1122
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,556

take your place.

1123

1124
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:44,730
Me!

1125
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,898
I'm sorry, Fred.
Would you mind repeating
that in my good ear?

1126
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,196
I want to be the Easter Bunny.

1127
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:55,828
What was that for?

1128
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,826
That is for people
who have gone loony!

1129
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,908
A human Easter Bunny?

1130
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:02,206
Come on, Fred!
It doesn't make sense.

1131
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:04,583
A bunny makes no sense.
You deliver eggs.

1132

If you wanna get all logical,
bring logic into this,

1133
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,128

an Easter Chicken.

1134
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,376
What? Come on.

1135
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:12,466
People might resist it
at first. But, hey,
change can be a good thing.

1136
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,386
You don't want the job anyway.
The pressure is ungodly!

1137
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:16,887
It did a number on me.

1138
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,843
Do you know there was
a period of roughly
nine months

1139
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:21,145
where rhe sight
of a colored egg
made me want to vomit?.

1140
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,185
And rabbits are
physically unable to vomit.

01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,113
Don't care.

1145

If you can be a drummer,
I can be the Easter Bunny.

1146

Fred, you can't just
be the Easter Bunny.

1147
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:39,163
My dad has to give
you special powers.
Eh.

1150

Finally, the Easter Bunny
has got to have

I'm serious.
I can do this.

1153

I will be the Bunny.

Hey, I know you guys.

You're the Pink Berets,
right?. Ha!

1254

E.B. said you guys
were so scary,
but you're really...

1255
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,592
You're really adorable.

They brought me here
to Iead them in all things
Easter, of course!

Hello, my fellow Easter-teers.

1262

I am truly, truly humbled
by your choice in me.

Is rhis part of
the coronation ritual?

1267
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,211
Phuh!

1268

What's going on?

1271
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,713
Who is this person
and what's he doing here?

1272
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,716
Wow, you're him.

1273
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:40,345
The big guy.
I'm Fred O'Hare.
I met you...

1274
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,896
Well, I didn't meet you.
I saw you when I was a kid.

You look great.

brace yourself.

he has killed your son!

Whar? E.B.?

1279
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:52,736
Did you say "kill"?

1280
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:54,488
No, I didn't kill E.B.

1281
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,860
Oh! Liar!

1282
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:58,947
This can't be so.
Where are the Pink Berets?.

1283
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,628
(GASPS) No!

1284
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:12,635
Wait a minute.
That's not...

1285

Silence, human!

1286
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:17,681
Can't you see
you have broken
his poor old heart?.

1287
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,091
Are you kidding me?

1288
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,972
OId friend,
I share your sorrow.

1289
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,642
E.B. was like
your son to me.

1290
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:25,556
I'm trying to
keep it together.

1291
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:28,563
But don't you worry,
I will take care of Easter.

1292
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:32,146
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Does
anyone care that that's
a Butterball turkey?.

1293
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:34,319
No, no, that is E.B.

1294
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:36,443
He has the same
shirt and everything.

01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:38,448
My deepest condolences.

1296

Attention, all bunnies.

1297
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:43,329
There will be
a service for E.B.
in the egg painting room.

Carlos. What are you up to?

1300
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,591
It's called
a coup d'état.

1301
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,018
Which is French
for coup d'état!

of doing number two.

for number one!

that kind of voice
in my head!

should have thought of that
before you abandoned Fred.

something positive about me.

Acrually, David Hasselhoff,
I've got a problem.

Hmm.

1338
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,089
Is it the jitters?

1339

Believe me,
even I used to get them.

No, ir's not
the jitters, David.

1341
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:05,345
I'm starting to realize
I might be
a really selfish rabbit.

Look, I love drumming.

trained ninja bunnies.

as time itself.

you could ever want.

Yes, and all the...

1352
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,997
You're not really
helping much, David.

1353

Like, at all!

1354
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,331

in real trouble.

CARLOS: The Easter moon
is on the rise.

At midnight,

1365
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:24,842
her radiant beams
will fill up the Egg
of Destiny with magic.

1366

Then, at Iast, Señor Bunny,

1367

I will be Easter's new king!

1368
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:32,470
Carlos, I'm
warning you!

1369
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:35,853
The Egg of Destiny
is too dangerous in
the hands of a chick.

1370
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:38,355
Its power can only
be wielded by a bunny.

1371
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:41,357
Oh, yes?.
Well, Iool at me wielding.
I'm wielding!

1372
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:43,814
Ooh-ooh. I'm wielding
it again. Okay?

1373
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:47,197
Oh, Carlos, can I wield
the Egg of Destiny?. PIease?

1374
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:48,323
No.

1375
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:49,574
Can I at least touch it?

1376
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:51,580
Ow!
There, you touched it.

1377
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:52,827
That was harsh.

1378
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,579
But, Carlos,
rhink of the children.

1379
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,501
Yes, but I am! The childrens.

1380
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,001
They don't want
candy and chocolate.

1381
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,331
From now on,

1382
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:04,840
their baskets will be filled
with clumps of bird seed,
dried crickets,

1383
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:07,717
and the world's finest worms!

1384
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:11,092
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

ALL: Mmm!

1386
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:15,304
Have you
completely Iost your mind?

1387
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:18,266
Silence! You see,
this is why he must go.

1388
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,524
It's this lousy attitude
of his. Well, no more!

1389
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:27,237
The more sensitive
chicks in the room
may want to avert their eyes.

1390
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:29,364
What about
a compromise, okay?

1391
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:32,197
The bunny gers Easter
one year and the chick
gets it the next.

1392
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:33,827
Enough of the chitty-chatty.

1393
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:36,625
Bye-bye, Easter Bunny.

Hello! Hey, everyone.

01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:41,880

ir was all a big mistake,
but I'm alive.
