3
00:00:57,523 --> 00:00:58,523
Come on!

4
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:10,511
Don't let him get away!

6
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:58,790
Get inside now!

7
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,700
Hurry up! You're late!

8
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:05,607
Proxima's gonna
have your hide.

9
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:08,450
Get back in the den.

10
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:11,932
Look what I stole!

11
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,983
Proxima'll give me
an extra portion for this!

12
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:15,955
Nope, I think she's gonna
give that extra portion to me.

13
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:16,809
Hey, give it back!

14
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:17,999
It belongs to
whoever's holding it!

15
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:18,909
And that's not you!

16
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,145
Lex!

17
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:21,531
Full Sabacc!

18
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,876
Idiot's Array.

19
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:23,941
What? Let me see that!

20
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:25,045
Nope, it's my card.

21
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:26,097
You cheat.

22
00:02:26,997 --> 00:02:27,997
Han!

23
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:33,510
You were gone too long!

24
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:35,019
I knew something
must've gone wrong.

25
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:36,626
This is nothing.
You should see them.

26
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,701
Look down here!

27
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,137
All right, listen.

28
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:41,522
I was in the middle
of the exchange,

29
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:42,668
I'm handing over
the coaxium

30
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,512
and his goons jumped me,
but I showed 'em.

31
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:45,148
How?

32
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:47,324
I ran away, then I
boosted their speeder.

33
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:48,400
What, are we
going somewhere?

34
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:50,193
Yeah, anywhere we want.

35
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:53,700
You held on to
one of the vials?

36
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:54,882
Han's back!

37
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,707
This,
this is worth...

38
00:02:58,747 --> 00:02:59,698
Five, six hundred credits.

39
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:01,902
That's more than
you said we'd need.

40
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:04,142
To buy our way out
of the control zone.

41
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,574
And off Corellia.

42
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:08,682
Han, this could work.

43
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,808
This is gonna work.

44
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:12,378
Qi'ra, you always said one day
we're gonna get out of here.

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,714
This is it.

46
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:16,535
What are we waiting for?

47
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,098
There he is.
Hey, you two!

48
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:29,014
Moloch. Hi, how are ya?

49
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:31,302
I was just on my way
to see Lady Proxima.

50
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,384
What a night I had.

51
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,613
You're not gonna believe it.
You'll believe it, but...

52
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:41,754
Hold still, scrumrat!

53
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:44,358
Easy.

54
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:46,519
Come on.

55
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,647
All right.

56
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:49,902
Let's go see Lady Proxima.

57
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:13,497
Well, what happened?

58
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:14,834
I'll tell you what happened.

59
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:17,044
They double-crossed you
and tried to kill me.

60
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:17,882
The money?

61
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:20,694
- They kept it.
- And my coaxium?

62
00:04:21,158 --> 00:04:21,782
They kept that, too.

63
00:04:21,822 --> 00:04:23,786
But we learned
a very valuable lesson.

64
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:26,427
We cannot trust those guys.

65
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,293
So you expect me to believe

66
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,929
that you walked away
with nothing!

67
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:35,219
I ran away with my life.
I think that's something.

68
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:37,418
To me, that's a lot.

69
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:39,725
I trusted you
with a simple task,

70
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:42,501
and all I'm hearing
are excuses.

71
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:48,831
There must be consequences
for disobedience

72
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,696
or else you never learn.

73
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,881
You know what?

74
00:05:00,622 --> 00:05:02,213
I don't think
I'm ever gonna learn.

75
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:03,888
What did you say?

76
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,311
I said, next time
somebody hits me,

77
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:10,762
I hit 'em back.

78
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:14,855
Moloch, wait!

79
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,221
Don't!

80
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:18,741
Qi'ra, remember the Silo?

81
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,616
We pulled you
out of that horror,

82
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:22,158
gave you a home.

83
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:25,874
Don't throw it away for Han.
He's not worth it!

84
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:29,367
Whatever he lost on the deal,
we'll earn it back, double.

85
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:30,694
We will make it up to you.

86
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:37,245
Everybody, stand back!

87
00:05:37,285 --> 00:05:39,028
What's that supposed to be?

88
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:40,712
This is a thermal detonator

89
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:43,247
that I just armed.

90
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:45,949
- That's a rock!
- No, it's not.

91
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:46,812
Yes, it is!

92
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:47,713
And you just made

93
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:49,477
a clicking sound
with your mouth.

94
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,241
Please tell me
this isn't your plan.

95
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:52,620
No, this is.

96
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,384
- Get in!
- An M-68?

97
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:06,226
- Nice, right?
- I love it!

98
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:15,479
Whoa!

99
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:42,045
There's a starliner leaving
from Coronet Spaceport,

100
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:43,320
we're gonna be on it.

101
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:47,001
We bribe our way through the
checkpoint, and we're free.

102
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,050
I'm gonna be a pilot.

103
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:51,518
We can get our own ship.

104
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:53,436
See the galaxy,
all of it.

105
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:58,254
We won't have to take orders
or be kicked around by anyone.

106
00:06:58,674 --> 00:06:59,675
Ever.

107
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,225
Thought we'd get a little
more of a head start.

108
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:23,372
- Whoa!
- Hang on!

109
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,704
<i>This is a secure area.</i>

110
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:36,830
<i>You must have
proper clearance.</i>

111
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,612
<i>Stop at once! You must
follow the proper...</i>

112
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,759
<i>Protocol.</i>

113
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:46,440
Damn!
That stinger's fast.

114
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,910
Yeah, but we're faster,
right?

115
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,390
I hope so.

116
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,883
<i>Pull over!</i>

117
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:45,373
Han, no,
we're not gonna make it!

118
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:46,130
Oh, yeah?

119
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,899
Han, I'm telling you,
it's too tight!

120
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:49,404
Watch this.

121
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:14,449
Come on!

122
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:16,670
We gotta move.

123
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:29,612
<i>Do not join the line</i>

124
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,410
<i>if you don't have
a boarding pass.</i>

125
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:36,011
<i>No access without ID chip.</i>

126
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,261
<i>All droids
must be registered.</i>

127
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,381
<i>Move along. Move along.</i>

128
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:46,925
<i>Stand down. Do not resist!</i>

129
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,651
- <i>Stop struggling.</i>
- Let me go!

130
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,620
<i>Take his arm.</i>

131
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,388
<i>I got him.</i>

132
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:53,559
<i>Take him to cell 3B.</i>

133
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:54,920
<i>This way, come on.</i>

134
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:57,409
<i>Keep moving.
Hold it, hold it.</i>

135
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:00,887
Next.

136
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,871
Han, they're here.

137
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,547
<i>Hey, what are you...</i>

138
00:10:10,587 --> 00:10:13,614
We're almost there.

139
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,619
- Just hold on to me.
- Next.

140
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:16,693
Don't look back.

141
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:20,243
Once we're through,
we've gotta be smart,

142
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,753
figure out
where we're going.

143
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:23,768
Anywhere the Empire isn't.
Wherever we go,

144
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:25,327
it can't be worse
than where we've been.

145
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:28,815
Yes, it can. Out there,
we've got no protection.

146
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:30,985
We could get snatched up
by traffickers,

147
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:33,554
sold to Crimson Dawn
or the Hutt Cartel.

148
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:35,712
That's not gonna happen.

149
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:36,963
I won't let it.

150
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:45,673
For luck?

151
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,006
Damn right.

152
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:53,128
<i>You heard him. Let's go.</i>

153
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,342
Next.

154
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,684
ID chips.

155
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,820
Funny thing,
we don't have 'em.

156
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:02,182
We have this.

157
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:03,705
Refined hyperfuel.

158
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:06,667
It's worth at least
800 credits, maybe more.

159
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:10,337
You could be detained
just for having that.

160
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:12,169
What good would
that do anybody?

161
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:14,240
Let us through,
it's all yours.

162
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:25,851
The coaxium, now.

163
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,473
As we're going through,
not before.

164
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:34,006
Do it.

165
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:37,183
Just do it, do it.

166
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,745
Not so fast, Qi'ra!
Come on!

167
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:45,406
Wait!
Open the door!

168
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,977
Security! Security,
there has been a breach!

169
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:49,413
Open the door!

170
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:51,949
- Run! Run!
- Get your hands off of her!

171
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,224
Run!

172
00:11:53,304 --> 00:11:55,055
Get your hands off of her!

173
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:56,888
Qi'ra!

174
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:59,259
Run, Han! Go!

175
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:00,693
Keep moving.

176
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:04,063
Qi'ra!

177
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:05,032
Run!

178
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:06,474
<i>Traveler
has been apprehended.</i>

179
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:09,776
Qi'ra, I'll come back!
I'll come back!

180
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,374
<i>All units,
there has been a breach.</i>

181
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:18,316
<i>Another unauthorized traveler
made it through the gate.</i>

182
00:12:18,356 --> 00:12:19,830
One got through
the gate! Look over there!

183
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:21,985
<i>Someone
got through the checkpoint.</i>

184
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:32,020
- Keep an eye on that gate.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:33,449
Can't let you through
without a ticket.

186
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:35,008
Can't let you through
without a ticket.

187
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,525
Hey, wait!

188
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,156
- Hey!
<i>- Come with us.</i>

189
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:43,687
<i>He's still
out there. Keep looking.</i>

190
00:12:55,783 --> 00:12:57,110
<i>You there, stop!</i>

191
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,763
- <i>Show me some identification.</i>
- Please. Please. No, no!

192
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:00,994
<i>Do not resist.</i>

193
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:04,416
<i>Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.</i>

194
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:08,975
<i>Explore new worlds.
Learn valuable skills.</i>

195
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,805
<i>Bring order and unity
to the galaxy!</i>

196
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,179
<i>Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.</i>

197
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,406
This is where I sign up
to be a pilot, right?

198
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:20,990
If you apply
for the Imperial Navy,

199
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,825
but most recruits
go into the infantry.

200
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:25,981
I'm gonna be a pilot.
Best in the galaxy.

201
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:27,784
You there,
come with us.

202
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:28,887
Who, me?

203
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,773
We have a few questions
to ask you.

204
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:32,562
How long
is that gonna take?

205
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:35,041
Depends on how good you are
at following orders.

206
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,477
Why, have you got
somewhere to be?

207
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:38,675
Yeah, back here,
as soon as I can.

208
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,129
Don't hear that much.
What's your name, son?

209
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,212
Han.

210
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:45,963
Han what?

211
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:48,926
Who are your people?

212
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:55,479
I don't have people.
I'm alone.

213
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:57,682
Han...

214
00:14:00,696 --> 00:14:01,816
Solo.

215
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:04,871
Approved.

216
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:08,703
Proceed to transport ID 83 for
the Naval Academy at Carida.

217
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:11,222
Good luck, Han Solo.

218
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:12,842
We'll have you flying
in no time.

219
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:29,929
Your Empire needs you.
Troopers forward!

220
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:32,028
Solo, get up!
We're almost there!

221
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:34,549
Almost where?
Where are we going?

222
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,501
Just over that last ridge.
Victory is...

223
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:51,049
My legs! My leg!

224
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:08,455
<i>Hey, Beckett,
you said we were here</i>

225
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:09,811
<i>to pull a quick job.</i>

226
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:11,789
- Yeah.
- <i>Well, this ain't a quick job!</i>

227
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,236
<i>It's a war!</i>

228
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:15,792
It's always
something with you.

229
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:20,342
AT-hauler.
That's what we came for.

230
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:22,760
Forward operations
must be this way.

231
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,429
They are, but the major said
we're supposed to go that way!

232
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:27,444
Yeah, go that way and die!

233
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:30,047
That's exactly what happened
to the major!

234
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:32,389
Who's the ranking
officer now?

235
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,119
You are, Captain.

236
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:37,569
<i>He's got you there.</i>

237
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:41,943
So what's the plan,
Captain Beckett?

238
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:45,294
Val, you take Rio and these
four mud skulls flank left.

239
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:46,885
I'll take this
mouthy scooch

240
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:48,169
and we'll go around
to the right

241
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:50,372
and maybe
we'll get lucky.

242
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,089
<i>Luck's got
nothin' to do with it.</i>

243
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:55,120
Wait! One question!

244
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,402
- You wanna live, sparky?
- Very much.

245
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,930
Then shut up and do what
your captain tells you.

246
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,219
Let's go!

247
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,260
Captain.

248
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,612
<i>T-15s are down.
We walk from here.</i>

249
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,772
Captain.

250
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:24,053
I'm Han.

251
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,745
Nobody cares.

252
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:30,289
Thanks for your help
back there.

253
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:31,587
You did all right.

254
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:34,225
I was trained
in aerial combat...

255
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:36,174
You want some advice?

256
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:37,442
Get the hell
away from here.

257
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:40,018
Any way you can,
as fast as you can.

258
00:16:43,406 --> 00:16:44,336
What company
do you command?

259
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:46,112
None of your business
company.

260
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:48,019
And we're full up.

261
00:16:48,995 --> 00:16:50,411
<i>Stick
to soldiering, kid.</i>

262
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:51,893
<i>You don't want
any part of this.</i>

263
00:16:58,498 --> 00:16:59,734
<i>Hang on, guys!</i>

264
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:03,302
Attention!

265
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:06,605
In three hours, we move out
for the southern marshlands.

266
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:09,263
I want an advance party
of ten men.

267
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:11,145
Great, more mud.

268
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:13,345
What was that?

269
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:16,195
Just wondering what our
objective is, Lieutenant.

270
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:19,056
Bring peace and prosperity
to the galaxy,

271
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:21,049
install a regime
loyal to the Emperor,

272
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,095
and eradicate
the hostiles.

273
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:25,391
It's their planet,
we're the hostiles.

274
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,643
You got a problem, trooper?

275
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:30,200
No problem, sir.

276
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,179
Moving out.

277
00:17:34,438 --> 00:17:37,077
To the southern
marshlands! Move out!

278
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:39,137
You heard 'em!
Let's move out!

279
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:49,388
Mmm. Looks like
they're running sorties

280
00:17:49,412 --> 00:17:51,000
every 30 minutes.

281
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,510
Yeah, I can take out the
guards at the perimeter,

282
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,865
signalman, pilot.

283
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:56,354
Hell, I'll just
take 'em all out.

284
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,783
What are we
looking at?

285
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:03,362
You have a talent for
sticking your nose in

286
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:04,810
where it doesn't belong.

287
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,412
I just couldn't help
but notice

288
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,723
you're wearing a uniform
pock-full of laser burns.

289
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:11,274
So either
you heal real quick

290
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:13,462
or you stole it off
a dead man.

291
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:15,637
You're not Imperial Army.

292
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:17,160
You're thieves here
to steal equipment

293
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:19,013
for a job and I want in.

294
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:21,441
- Well, now we gotta shoot him.
- No.

295
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:24,542
Snap his neck.
It's less mess.

296
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:25,957
Or you take me with you.

297
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:28,710
Look, I came up running scams
on the streets of Corellia.

298
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:31,215
I was boosting AV-21s
when I was ten.

299
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:33,095
I'm a driver, a flyer,

300
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,585
and hey, you said yourself.
I gotta get outta here. Right?

301
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:39,156
<i>What's a fancy flyboy
doing down in the mud?</i>

302
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:42,422
I got kicked out
of the Imperial Academy

303
00:18:42,505 --> 00:18:44,016
for having
a mind of my own.

304
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:47,535
But I am a great pilot.
And I gotta get home.

305
00:18:47,603 --> 00:18:50,175
<i>This guy is nuts. No
one goes back to Corellia.</i>

306
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:51,671
I got a reason.

307
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:53,837
We've already
got a great pilot.

308
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:56,466
The Ardennian.

309
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:58,639
<i>Ardennian?
You got a lot of nerve, pal.</i>

310
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,103
<i>I'm an Imperial trooper.</i>

311
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,362
Oh, really?
A couple of your arms

312
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:02,198
popped out of your butt

313
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:03,969
and hiked up your pants,
trooper.

314
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:04,768
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

315
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:07,212
Look, I'll do whatever it
takes to get back to Corellia.

316
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:08,488
I've already been away
too long.

317
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,431
Just give me a shot.

318
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:12,176
<i>Whoa. Hold it.</i>

319
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,663
Well, if you're
not interested in me,

320
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:18,699
I think the lieutenant might
be very interested in you.

321
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:23,775
Blackmail.

322
00:19:26,211 --> 00:19:27,180
Lieutenant.

323
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
Captain.

324
00:19:29,214 --> 00:19:31,760
Lieutenant, we have
apprehended a deserter.

325
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,707
Take him.

326
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:33,538
Wait.

327
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:36,548
I should've known.
This one's a troublemaker.

328
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:38,782
And a liar. Don't
believe anything he says.

329
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:40,950
- Don't go anywhere without me.
<i>- All right, let's go.</i>

330
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:42,199
Feed him to the beast.

331
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:43,926
The beast?
Wait, there's a beast?

332
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:45,175
- Hold on!
<i>- Move it!</i>

333
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:47,430
Listen, that guy's not
even an officer. All right?

334
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,806
- He was lying!
<i>- Quiet!</i>

335
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,601
<i>Don't care.</i>

336
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:56,246
<i>Haven't fed
him in three days.</i>

337
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:57,540
<i>Should be fun.</i>

338
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:46,495
Oh! Hey!
Hey, big fella.

339
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:49,244
Just calm down.
Take it easy.

340
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:50,838
We're on the same side.

341
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,593
You like treats?

342
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:56,643
Help!
Let me out of here!

343
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:57,852
Let me out of here!

344
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:02,993
A-ha! Gotcha!

345
00:21:09,171 --> 00:21:10,407
Ahhh!

346
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,693
<i>Ah, this was
just getting good.</i>

347
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:27,081
<i>- He killed him too fast.
- Yeah!</i>

348
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:28,422
<i>Kill him slower.</i>

349
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:32,663
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

350
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:35,266
Wait! Wait!

351
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:40,108
Yeah, I speak a little.

352
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:43,067
Now just listen to me, you...

353
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,448
Yes, yes!

354
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:05,358
No, no, no, no!

355
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:09,193
Do it!

356
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,478
Come on.

357
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:13,849
Oh, no!

358
00:22:14,211 --> 00:22:16,029
<i>Ten credits, he doesn't
last another minute.</i>

359
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,929
Let me out of here!

360
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:19,726
I can't take it anymore!

361
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:22,971
- Oh, no! Stop, please!
- <i>That's it. Get him!</i>

362
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,728
You tired, you mangy
Kashyyykian moof-milker?

363
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:41,486
See what happens
when you listen to me?

364
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,474
Hey, what are you doing?

365
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,518
Ow.

366
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:51,694
Follow me!

367
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:03,999
Wait, wait.

368
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,934
Come here.
Listen to me.

369
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:06,932
You don't understand,
okay?

370
00:23:06,972 --> 00:23:07,874
I have some
very good friends

371
00:23:07,914 --> 00:23:09,034
waiting for me
at that airfield.

372
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:10,455
They're leaving
right now.

373
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:12,174
That's our one way
off this mud ball.

374
00:23:12,214 --> 00:23:13,850
If you wanna live,
we go that way.

375
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,363
After that, you go whichever
way you want, I don't care!

376
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:18,511
But right now,
that's the way you go!

377
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,275
Trust me!

378
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,237
Val, let's go!

379
00:23:28,563 --> 00:23:31,477
How do they breathe in these
suits? It's so stuffy!

380
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:33,432
No wonder
they're such lousy pilots.

381
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:35,164
You can't turn your head,
you can't breathe,

382
00:23:35,188 --> 00:23:36,578
you can't hear each other!

383
00:23:43,517 --> 00:23:45,023
I'll be damned.

384
00:23:45,117 --> 00:23:46,528
Hey, look who's back!

385
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:47,841
Unbelievable!

386
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:49,654
Wait!

387
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,552
Wait!

388
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,225
Whoa, is that a Wookiee?
Incredible!

389
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:55,589
I'll say it, I don't care.

390
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,164
This kid's growing on me.

391
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:59,138
Wait!

392
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:03,791
You know, we could always use

393
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:05,846
some muscle
on a job like this.

394
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,866
Don't even
think about it!

395
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:10,299
I'm telling you, you will
never have a deeper sleep

396
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:12,065
than curled up
in a Wookiee's lap.

397
00:24:17,928 --> 00:24:20,685
I told you!

398
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,813
Very good friends!

399
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:50,448
We couldn't have done this
maybe, like, one at a time?

400
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:20,360
Thanks for helping me
get outta there.

401
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,651
No, they only took you
because of me.

402
00:25:29,831 --> 00:25:30,975
Hey!

403
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:33,726
I got us
a real sweet deal here.

404
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:35,780
We do this one job
with them,

405
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:37,685
we make some real money,

406
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:39,888
and then we're free.

407
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,038
When's the last time
you could say that?

408
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:47,746
Been a while
for me, too.

409
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,472
So what's your name,
anyway?

410
00:25:54,816 --> 00:25:57,242
Chewbacca?

411
00:25:57,338 --> 00:25:59,628
All right, well, you're gonna
need a nickname,

412
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:01,441
'cause I ain't saying that
every time.

413
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:08,705
Here it comes.
Take a look.

414
00:26:08,745 --> 00:26:09,387
Yeah.

415
00:26:09,427 --> 00:26:13,322
We hit the Conveyex between
the tower and the bridge.

416
00:26:13,384 --> 00:26:16,564
Rio drops us in, we separate
the payload container,

417
00:26:16,605 --> 00:26:19,195
cable it up to the AT-hauler
and then...

418
00:26:19,235 --> 00:26:21,089
Rio jams
their distress signal.

419
00:26:21,772 --> 00:26:22,872
I blow the bridge,

420
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:24,806
the container slides
right off the track

421
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:26,259
and we sail away.

422
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:28,064
You trip that security beam,

423
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:29,227
wake up those Vipers,

424
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:31,690
it's liable to get
real spicy, real fast.

425
00:26:31,752 --> 00:26:33,912
Well, I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

426
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,372
Enfys Nest.

427
00:26:35,466 --> 00:26:36,831
What's an Enfys Nest?

428
00:26:36,907 --> 00:26:38,002
I told you,
we're way ahead

429
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:39,826
of the competition
on this one.

430
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:41,083
There's no way Enfys Nest

431
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:43,186
even knows
about this shipment.

432
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,949
Only my guy
has the intel.

433
00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:47,480
Well, you better
be right. Yeah?

434
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:49,693
Because sometimes,
you put your faith

435
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:51,117
in the wrong people.

436
00:26:53,353 --> 00:26:55,843
<i>Our whole future
depends on this one score</i>

437
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:57,201
<i>and you bring in amateurs.</i>

438
00:26:57,256 --> 00:26:58,499
<i>In case you hadn't noticed,</i>

439
00:26:58,523 --> 00:27:00,166
<i>we're a little shorthanded.</i>

440
00:27:00,236 --> 00:27:01,691
So we get who we need.

441
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:04,219
The Xan sisters, or Bossk.

442
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:06,550
But, no, instead you're
putting our lives

443
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,167
in the hands of morons.

444
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,537
You guys morons?

445
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:11,429
No!

446
00:27:11,469 --> 00:27:13,615
- No. See?
- We're not morons.

447
00:27:13,655 --> 00:27:16,630
Look, I waited a long time
for a shot like this.

448
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,476
I'm not about to screw it up,
all right?

449
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:20,436
Oh, come on, Val!

450
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,114
He looks so sincere.

451
00:27:22,161 --> 00:27:23,541
Plus, have you ever
tried to disinvite

452
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:24,661
a Wookiee to anything?

453
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:27,231
Not a good idea!

454
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,621
This is not funny!

455
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:33,151
Look, now, I have great
instincts about these guys.

456
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:37,065
And, besides,
do you see any other options?

457
00:27:37,105 --> 00:27:38,469
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

458
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:41,257
Yeah, I know exactly
what I'm doing and why.

459
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:43,151
We're gonna
clear our debts,

460
00:27:43,191 --> 00:27:45,104
go back to Glee Anselm,

461
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:48,824
and I'm finally gonna learn
how to play that valachord.

462
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,052
Babe, you're never gonna learn
how to play the valachord.

463
00:27:51,076 --> 00:27:52,905
She's right.
You are tone-deaf.

464
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,838
So what's your sob story,
flyboy?

465
00:27:58,878 --> 00:27:59,752
Who, me?

466
00:27:59,793 --> 00:28:01,790
You're after something,
I know the look.

467
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,485
What is it?
Revenge?

468
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:05,957
No, it's not revenge.

469
00:28:06,223 --> 00:28:07,551
Look at him.

470
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:09,239
If it's anything,
it's a girl.

471
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,261
Oh, a girl!

472
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:12,867
Tell us about the girl, Han.
Is she nice?

473
00:28:13,461 --> 00:28:15,126
Does she have sharp teeth?

474
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,608
There was a girl.

475
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:23,248
But I got out,
she didn't.

476
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,967
I swore to myself
I'd become a pilot,

477
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,054
get a ship,

478
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,442
go back and find her.

479
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:36,337
That's what I'm gonna do
right after this job.

480
00:28:36,408 --> 00:28:38,444
How you know
she'll still be there?

481
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,968
I just know.

482
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:42,402
Personally, I refuse
to be tied down

483
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:44,588
by anyone,
though many have tried.

484
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:47,459
Come on, Rio.
You don't fool me.

485
00:28:47,598 --> 00:28:49,312
Everybody needs somebody.

486
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,827
Even a broken down
old crook like this one.

487
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,771
How about you? What are you
gonna do with your share?

488
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:20,790
What was he saying?

489
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,235
He said the Wookiees
were enslaved

490
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:24,808
by the Empire,
taken off Kashyyyk.

491
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,823
He's searching
for his, uh...

492
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:30,271
I don't know if he said
tribe or family.

493
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:32,920
What's the difference?

494
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,545
Show me how to do that.

495
00:29:37,726 --> 00:29:39,955
The only thing
you need to learn to do

496
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:45,278
is do what I say
when I say it.

497
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:47,365
And this time tomorrow,

498
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:48,639
you'll have
more than enough

499
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:50,082
to buy your own ship.

500
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:13,336
<i>Starting the clock.</i>

501
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:16,078
Jamming their signal.
9.6 to the bridge.

502
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:18,521
<i>Let's find out how good
we really are, folks.</i>

503
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:31,209
I'm fine!

504
00:30:35,426 --> 00:30:37,110
Val, how's it going
up there?

505
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:42,420
Never better.

506
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:06,989
Coaxium.

507
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:09,315
Enough to power a fleet!

508
00:31:09,355 --> 00:31:11,861
Or blow us all
straight to hell!

509
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,824
<i>All right, talk to me.</i>

510
00:31:16,045 --> 00:31:17,274
Is it a good day?

511
00:31:17,485 --> 00:31:19,079
<i>It's a great day!</i>

512
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,683
Best day of your life,
my grabby friend!

513
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:22,896
I don't know,
you've never been

514
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,710
to a Mynock roast
on Ardennia.

515
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,851
It's nuts!

516
00:31:28,476 --> 00:31:29,670
Here they come!

517
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:31,460
Get down to the couplers!

518
00:31:31,508 --> 00:31:33,061
Rio, fall back!

519
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,438
Well, that didn't
take 'em long.

520
00:31:52,752 --> 00:31:53,752
Chewie!

521
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:11,822
You all right?

522
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:13,664
Little close there,
buddy!

523
00:32:18,085 --> 00:32:19,796
Han, what's the holdup?

524
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,916
All right, together.

525
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,737
Now!

526
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,730
All right!

527
00:32:33,523 --> 00:32:34,524
Oh!

528
00:32:38,632 --> 00:32:41,072
They got one uncoupled.
Where are you, buddy?

529
00:32:41,145 --> 00:32:42,978
<i>Just up here
planning my retirement.</i>

530
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,266
Thinking about opening
a cantina

531
00:32:44,268 --> 00:32:46,640
somewhere warm
but not too warm, you know?

532
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,050
Lowering
the winch cables now!

533
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:07,849
I knew it! I told him!
Beckett!

534
00:33:07,923 --> 00:33:09,091
<i>He's coming!</i>

535
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:13,134
Damn it! I'm never gonna
hear the end of this!

536
00:33:17,884 --> 00:33:19,111
Who's that?

537
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:20,707
Enfys Nest!

538
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,501
Marauders, pirates.

539
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,333
Come to snake the score
from under us.

540
00:33:25,362 --> 00:33:27,096
<i>Ready your harpoons.</i>

541
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:28,099
<i>Move in.</i>

542
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:11,008
Hang on!
I got an uninvited guest.

543
00:34:11,094 --> 00:34:14,452
Get off of my ship!

544
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,521
You still with us, brother?

545
00:34:20,577 --> 00:34:22,479
Yeah, I'm okay.

546
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:24,540
Just nicked one of my shoulders.
It's nothing.

547
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,313
He's not okay.

548
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:34,937
Chewie!

549
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:37,306
You gotta uncouple this one
on your own!

550
00:34:42,754 --> 00:34:44,081
Han!

551
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,398
I'm on it!

552
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,104
Val!

553
00:34:56,106 --> 00:34:59,096
<i>Keep your eyes open.
We just tripped a sensor.</i>

554
00:35:04,578 --> 00:35:06,145
Viper droids
headed your way!

555
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:09,316
Rio?

556
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:11,531
Yeah, it looks worse
than it is.

557
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:14,284
Just gotta patch it up.

558
00:35:14,324 --> 00:35:16,694
Maybe rest my eyes
for a minute.

559
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:38,870
<i>Enough!
I'm going in.</i>

560
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,580
You weren't lying, kid.

561
00:36:06,922 --> 00:36:08,617
You're a hell of a pilot.

562
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:10,014
Rio, stay with me, buddy.

563
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:24,959
Beckett,
we just lost a cable!

564
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:27,945
<i>2.1 to the bridge!</i>

565
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:33,686
It's no good
to die alone, kid.

566
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:36,692
Val was right.

567
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:40,457
Rio?

568
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:12,962
Beckett, we're .8
from the bridge!

569
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:15,165
<i>Val's still on the track!</i>

570
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:17,404
Val, you gotta
get off that bridge!

571
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:18,406
We're here!

572
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,510
They got me pinned!

573
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,731
I'm gonna have to finish
the job from right here.

574
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:28,374
What?

575
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:30,054
It's been a ride, babe.

576
00:37:31,658 --> 00:37:33,627
And I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

577
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:35,353
<i>Val!</i>

578
00:37:35,423 --> 00:37:36,624
No!

579
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:44,506
No!

580
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,966
Chewie, now!

581
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,520
<i>Beckett, I can't
pull it away from 'em.</i>

582
00:38:25,257 --> 00:38:27,658
They'll let go,
you fly straight!

583
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,526
<i>Release your cables</i>

584
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:33,003
<i>or die!</i>

585
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:34,990
We're too close.

586
00:38:34,992 --> 00:38:36,120
I gotta release.

587
00:38:36,122 --> 00:38:37,596
You do what
I tell you, Han!

588
00:38:37,598 --> 00:38:39,050
Chewie, grab the line!

589
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,482
Don't you do it!

590
00:38:43,778 --> 00:38:44,975
Han!

591
00:38:45,015 --> 00:38:46,581
<i>You coward!</i>

592
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,694
What the hell?

593
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:40,427
You don't listen
and you can't follow orders!

594
00:39:40,553 --> 00:39:42,895
You have any idea
what you've done?

595
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,800
We were not stealing
for ourselves,

596
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:48,417
we were hired
by Crimson Dawn.

597
00:39:50,778 --> 00:39:53,041
Crimson Dawn?

598
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:55,401
Now we owe them 100 keys
of refined coaxium.

599
00:39:55,403 --> 00:39:57,599
When they find out
we don't got it,

600
00:39:57,902 --> 00:39:59,670
they're gonna kill us.

601
00:40:00,737 --> 00:40:02,366
Right.

602
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,791
We run.

603
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:06,701
I'm already a deserter.
What's the difference?

604
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:08,041
The difference

605
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:09,701
is the Empire
doesn't send out

606
00:40:09,703 --> 00:40:12,036
a team of enforcers
to hunt you down

607
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,559
when you're a deserter.

608
00:40:13,638 --> 00:40:15,073
Dryden Vos will.

609
00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:18,169
You have any idea
what it's like

610
00:40:18,171 --> 00:40:20,108
to live with a price
on your head?

611
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:24,358
The only thing to do
is to go to them.

612
00:40:24,445 --> 00:40:26,816
Maybe I can find some way
to make it up to him.

613
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:32,816
Then that's what we do.

614
00:40:37,623 --> 00:40:38,824
No.

615
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:45,327
He knows me,
not you.

616
00:40:46,337 --> 00:40:48,672
If you come with me

617
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,617
and show your face,

618
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,454
if they don't kill you,

619
00:40:55,008 --> 00:40:57,111
you're in this life for good.

620
00:40:59,368 --> 00:41:02,204
You find some way
to square this,

621
00:41:04,149 --> 00:41:05,983
we still get our money?

622
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:09,193
Maybe.

623
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,012
For me,
it's worth the risk.

624
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:17,676
How about you?

625
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:26,520
That's yes.

626
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,631
Sorry I punched your face.

627
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,020
Happens more often
than you think.

628
00:41:36,154 --> 00:41:37,041
So when we get up there,

629
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:39,321
Dryden Vos is waiting for us
at Fort Ypso?

630
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:42,480
Nearby,
on his yacht.

631
00:41:42,546 --> 00:41:44,541
You're gonna know
how to find it?

632
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,190
That won't be
a problem.

633
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:30,151
I'll need to
check your weapons.

634
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,999
That's all I got left.

635
00:43:13,517 --> 00:43:16,410
I'm here to see Dryden.
He's expecting me.

636
00:43:16,517 --> 00:43:17,840
He'll be with you
shortly.

637
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:20,004
He's just finishing
with the regional governor.

638
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,525
Excuse me, sir.

639
00:43:26,527 --> 00:43:27,588
Yes.

640
00:43:27,677 --> 00:43:30,565
- Beckett has arrived.
- Oh.

641
00:43:32,689 --> 00:43:36,267
Put this in my office.
I might be needing it later.

642
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:45,255
I get all worked up.
Silly.

643
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,830
It's a party.

644
00:43:50,288 --> 00:43:51,459
Hey.

645
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:54,620
These people are
not your friends

646
00:43:54,746 --> 00:43:57,376
and they're never gonna be,
so don't talk to any of 'em.

647
00:43:57,449 --> 00:43:58,579
Don't look at anybody,

648
00:43:58,581 --> 00:44:00,408
just keep your eyes down.

649
00:44:04,204 --> 00:44:05,757
I might get a drink.

650
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:20,021
No, yeah, whatever.

651
00:44:38,382 --> 00:44:40,852
Chewie, would you please...

652
00:44:49,968 --> 00:44:51,730
Qi'ra, what are you
doing here?

653
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,094
I work here.

654
00:44:53,369 --> 00:44:55,131
What's your excuse?

655
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:56,463
My... I...

656
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:58,135
Qi'ra, I was...

657
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:02,845
I was coming back
for you.

658
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:05,369
It's in the past, Han.

659
00:45:05,457 --> 00:45:05,997
Not for me.

660
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:06,963
The only reason I'm here,

661
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:08,567
I was doing this job,
get a little money

662
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:11,309
and then I was gonna come back
to Corellia and find you.

663
00:45:11,386 --> 00:45:13,454
Well, now you don't have to.

664
00:45:14,486 --> 00:45:16,455
I'm right in front of you.

665
00:45:18,673 --> 00:45:19,964
That day...

666
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:21,715
Sometimes,
a lot of times, I think...

667
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:23,018
If you'd have stayed,

668
00:45:24,231 --> 00:45:26,301
they would've killed you.

669
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,728
I'm glad you got out.

670
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,470
How did you get out?

671
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:41,104
I didn't.

672
00:45:44,306 --> 00:45:46,061
You look good.

673
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,844
A little rough
around the edges,

674
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:49,243
but good.

675
00:45:49,787 --> 00:45:50,889
You too.

676
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:52,826
Thank you, Ottilie.

677
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:55,458
Have you been attentive
to Dok-Ondar?

678
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,528
Very.

679
00:45:59,977 --> 00:46:02,007
What should we drink to?

680
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:05,254
Let's drink two
and see where it goes.

681
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:15,952
Did you ever get that ship
we were going to fly away on?

682
00:46:15,975 --> 00:46:18,139
Yeah.
Sort of.

683
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,490
About to.
That's why I'm here.

684
00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:22,868
I'm working on a...

685
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:24,827
Very big deal.

686
00:46:24,854 --> 00:46:25,982
How big?

687
00:46:26,171 --> 00:46:27,182
Enormous.

688
00:46:27,237 --> 00:46:30,768
Really? And when are you going
to close this enormous deal?

689
00:46:30,883 --> 00:46:32,451
Any minute.

690
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:36,134
I thought
about you a lot.

691
00:46:36,195 --> 00:46:39,411
Off somewhere,
some adventure.

692
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,543
I imagined myself with you.
It always made me...

693
00:46:45,544 --> 00:46:47,274
- What?
- Hey.

694
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,398
What did I say?

695
00:46:49,452 --> 00:46:51,491
Look, I can't keep my eyes
down the whole time.

696
00:46:51,571 --> 00:46:52,968
I'm gonna
bump into something.

697
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,350
But I told you
not to talk to anyone.

698
00:46:54,374 --> 00:46:55,375
Beckett.

699
00:46:56,262 --> 00:46:59,133
Wait.
You two work together?

700
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:01,507
- Yeah.
- Tobias!

701
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,148
Dryden.

702
00:47:05,195 --> 00:47:07,204
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

703
00:47:07,206 --> 00:47:09,075
No, I'm fine.

704
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:11,795
I'm sorry
to hear about Val.

705
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,250
Yeah,
I appreciate that.

706
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:14,594
But there was no way
we could've anticipated...

707
00:47:14,596 --> 00:47:17,158
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

708
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,208
Yeah. This is Han Solo
and Chewbacca.

709
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,804
They're with me.

710
00:47:21,807 --> 00:47:23,535
I'm Dryden Vos.

711
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:27,400
I see you've already met
my top lieutenant.

712
00:47:29,836 --> 00:47:32,016
Han and I grew up
together on Corellia.

713
00:47:32,701 --> 00:47:35,110
Oh, fellow scrumrat.

714
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:38,539
I admire anyone who can crawl
their way out of the sewer.

715
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:41,456
Especially,
a sewer as putrid as Corellia.

716
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,520
The stench, am I right?

717
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,160
Well, it's good
to have you.

718
00:47:46,335 --> 00:47:48,071
Welcome.

719
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:50,452
And you, too, Chewbacca,
welcome.

720
00:47:51,116 --> 00:47:55,153
All right, let's eat a
little, drink a lot,

721
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:56,498
and talk privately.

722
00:47:59,694 --> 00:48:01,103
We're just friends,
all right?

723
00:48:01,105 --> 00:48:03,032
You're touchy.

724
00:48:03,921 --> 00:48:07,593
Beckett, you have
put me in a terrible position.

725
00:48:07,644 --> 00:48:09,725
I know, Dryden,
and I am sorry.

726
00:48:09,784 --> 00:48:10,709
You're sorry?

727
00:48:10,747 --> 00:48:12,210
Dryden, there were
complications.

728
00:48:12,212 --> 00:48:13,000
There were factors.

729
00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:16,423
Enfys Nest has been
a constant irritation forever.

730
00:48:16,425 --> 00:48:18,032
It's one you should've
anticipated,

731
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:19,595
it's one you should've
dealt with.

732
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:21,083
Trust me, I know
I made a mistake,

733
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:24,076
but when you hired me,
you told me

734
00:48:24,078 --> 00:48:25,076
no one else
had this information...

735
00:48:25,078 --> 00:48:26,467
Test me!

736
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:30,436
Test me one more time,
you'll see what happens.

737
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,895
I think what Dryden
is trying to say

738
00:48:32,897 --> 00:48:35,828
is that we're not interested
in why you don't have it.

739
00:48:36,036 --> 00:48:37,890
No, I'm not interested.

740
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:39,701
I'm not interested
at all.

741
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:40,963
Dryden,

742
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:42,938
what can I do
to make this right?

743
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:44,847
"Make this right?"

744
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,316
There is no
making this right.

745
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:48,846
You know who I answer to

746
00:48:48,848 --> 00:48:51,201
and you know
what he'll expect of me.

747
00:48:51,203 --> 00:48:53,340
He'll say, "There have
to be consequences."

748
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:57,067
So here's what I need you
to do for me.

749
00:48:57,195 --> 00:49:00,730
I need you to give me
a reason

750
00:49:01,192 --> 00:49:03,837
not to kill you all.

751
00:49:03,886 --> 00:49:05,796
Because I will
make it up to you.

752
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:07,076
No, no, no. How?

753
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:08,363
How will you
make it up to me?

754
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:11,764
By delivering exactly
what was promised.

755
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:15,431
100 k-grams of
refined coaxium?

756
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:18,869
Yes. We will simply steal it
from somewhere else.

757
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:20,301
From where?

758
00:49:20,382 --> 00:49:21,510
You'll be hard pushed
to find that

759
00:49:21,512 --> 00:49:23,187
anywhere outside
an Imperial vault.

760
00:49:23,189 --> 00:49:25,184
Scarif.
Maybe Mercy Island.

761
00:49:25,186 --> 00:49:26,520
That's impossible.

762
00:49:26,522 --> 00:49:29,219
So, let's come up
with some other options.

763
00:49:29,286 --> 00:49:30,581
Other ideas
that we might...

764
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,486
What about unrefined?

765
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:38,694
Well, the only known
source of astatic coaxium

766
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:41,690
is a fissure vent beneath
the spice mines on Kessel.

767
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:43,925
Yeah. That's the one
I was thinking of.

768
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:45,558
That's a very,
very good one.

769
00:49:45,637 --> 00:49:47,850
But see,
the Pykes control Kessel.

770
00:49:47,903 --> 00:49:48,926
Crimson Dawn maintains

771
00:49:48,968 --> 00:49:51,263
a fragile alliance
with the Pykes.

772
00:49:51,352 --> 00:49:53,628
It's one that
I can't jeopardize

773
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,759
without risking an all-out
war with the Syndicates,

774
00:49:55,761 --> 00:49:58,939
and that, gentlemen,
I will not do.

775
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:02,735
So, if that's all you have,
I think we're done here.

776
00:50:02,737 --> 00:50:03,598
Not all we have.

777
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,630
We don't have any alliance
with the Pykes.

778
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:09,101
Right, so nobody is gonna know
we're working for you.

779
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:20,090
Possible?

780
00:50:20,554 --> 00:50:21,817
It's risky.

781
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:24,517
As soon as the raw coaxium
is removed from the vault,

782
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:26,173
it starts to destabilize,

783
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,808
so unless...

784
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,339
Unless...

785
00:50:29,669 --> 00:50:30,937
Unless...

786
00:50:31,563 --> 00:50:32,691
Work with me here.

787
00:50:32,693 --> 00:50:34,481
Unless you could
find somewhere

788
00:50:34,483 --> 00:50:36,183
to get it processed fast.

789
00:50:36,185 --> 00:50:37,467
- Uh...
- Uh...

790
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:39,676
Well...

791
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:42,029
He's saying Savareen?

792
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:43,380
Savareen.

793
00:50:43,382 --> 00:50:45,288
Yeah,
it's an old refinery there

794
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,472
and it's not under
Imperial jurisdiction.

795
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:49,215
But Qi'ra's right.

796
00:50:49,277 --> 00:50:52,708
The canisters will explode
before you get there,

797
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:55,091
so you'd need
an incredibly fast ship

798
00:50:55,146 --> 00:50:56,800
and a brilliant pilot.

799
00:50:56,914 --> 00:50:58,448
We'll find a ship.

800
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,160
We've already
got the pilot.

801
00:51:04,847 --> 00:51:08,611
He is arrogant
and he's hungry.

802
00:51:08,641 --> 00:51:09,597
So what do you think,
my dear?

803
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,399
You think your friend here
can do what needs to be done?

804
00:51:20,922 --> 00:51:22,891
Yes, I believe he can.

805
00:51:24,506 --> 00:51:25,794
Well, that is good news,

806
00:51:25,796 --> 00:51:27,792
because you're going with him

807
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:30,359
to see that he does.

808
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:33,577
All right?

809
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:35,804
Of course.

810
00:51:37,421 --> 00:51:38,984
All right.

811
00:51:39,035 --> 00:51:40,696
I'll see you all
on Savareen.

812
00:51:40,804 --> 00:51:41,824
Savareen it is.

813
00:51:41,878 --> 00:51:43,667
- I feel great about this plan.
- Me, too.

814
00:51:43,669 --> 00:51:45,395
We should do this again.
It's been fun.

815
00:51:45,927 --> 00:51:46,444
Great.

816
00:51:46,446 --> 00:51:48,108
Oh, just one more thing.

817
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:50,448
If you do fail me again,

818
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:53,635
we'll all be out of options.

819
00:51:54,238 --> 00:51:55,309
Right?

820
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:56,379
We won't.

821
00:51:59,414 --> 00:52:02,230
So, I thought
that went really well.

822
00:52:02,282 --> 00:52:04,523
Let's get this done as quick
and as clean as possible.

823
00:52:04,525 --> 00:52:05,411
What do you need?

824
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,170
I can scrounge up
the gear.

825
00:52:07,172 --> 00:52:08,686
Do you got a line
on a ship?

826
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:09,925
I know a guy.

827
00:52:11,182 --> 00:52:13,645
And I know
just where to find him.

828
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:15,706
It's a long shot,
but it's worth a try.

829
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,075
He's the best
smuggler around.

830
00:52:17,077 --> 00:52:18,229
He's slipped through
the Empire's fingers

831
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:20,362
more times than anyone else.

832
00:52:20,832 --> 00:52:23,176
He's attractive, too.

833
00:52:23,178 --> 00:52:24,140
Sophisticated,

834
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:27,947
with impeccable taste
and... Charisma.

835
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,045
Not to mention
his prodigious...

836
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:33,127
We get it.

837
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,895
But he's retired.
Says he's a sportsman now.

838
00:52:40,897 --> 00:52:42,658
All we need is his ship.

839
00:52:42,773 --> 00:52:44,484
Well, he'll never
part with it.

840
00:52:44,486 --> 00:52:45,667
He loves that ship.

841
00:52:45,669 --> 00:52:47,136
He won it

842
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:48,814
playing Sabacc.

843
00:52:48,816 --> 00:52:50,094
And there's the rub, right?

844
00:52:50,096 --> 00:52:52,208
How was I supposed to know
she was an Imperial spy?

845
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,406
I thought she loved me.

846
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:55,939
That's the guy, huh?

847
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:57,302
Hmm.

848
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,498
An interesting style.

849
00:52:59,773 --> 00:53:00,775
I'll say.

850
00:53:01,564 --> 00:53:02,697
You say he won his ship?

851
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:04,815
You have an awful Sabacc face.
I'm gonna call it.

852
00:53:04,817 --> 00:53:06,454
I can take him.
Let me at him.

853
00:53:06,456 --> 00:53:07,918
Absolutely not.

854
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,982
Han, these guys
are serious gamblers.

855
00:53:10,043 --> 00:53:12,139
I'm serious. Stake me.

856
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:14,547
Don't listen to him.

857
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:23,007
Thank you. Thank you.

858
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:24,779
You see, how'd you guys
let me beat you on that one?

859
00:53:24,781 --> 00:53:25,782
Come on.

860
00:53:27,101 --> 00:53:29,217
There's no liars in this game,
just players.

861
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,810
Is this seat taken?

862
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:36,237
If nobody's in the seat,
then it ain't taken, friend.

863
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:41,800
So this is, uh, Sabacc?

864
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:42,954
Sabacc.

865
00:53:42,956 --> 00:53:45,587
Sabacc. Got it.

866
00:53:45,641 --> 00:53:46,835
You play it before?

867
00:53:47,116 --> 00:53:48,609
A couple times, yeah.

868
00:53:50,122 --> 00:53:51,579
Captain Lando Calrissian.

869
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:53,430
Han Solo.

870
00:53:53,432 --> 00:53:55,361
Looks like you're
having a good day.

871
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:56,641
I'm a lucky guy.

872
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:00,431
Can I ask you a question,
Captain Calrissian?

873
00:54:00,643 --> 00:54:01,987
Anything, Han.

874
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:05,658
That's "Han",
but that's okay.

875
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:09,296
I heard a story about you.
I was wondering if it's true.

876
00:54:10,453 --> 00:54:14,053
Everything you've heard
about me is true.

877
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,180
Thanks, love.

878
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:17,511
Did you win your ship
playing cards?

879
00:54:17,513 --> 00:54:19,098
Oh, I've won a lot of things.

880
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:23,755
I once won a subtropical moon
in the Oseon Belt.

881
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:24,960
Wow.

882
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:27,088
Turned out to be
a real money pit.

883
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:27,819
I'm impressed.

884
00:54:27,859 --> 00:54:29,120
I don't think I'd have
the nerve to gamble

885
00:54:29,122 --> 00:54:31,417
with something
I love as much as my ship.

886
00:54:31,461 --> 00:54:33,024
- Really?
- Yeah.

887
00:54:33,454 --> 00:54:34,489
What do you fly?

888
00:54:35,195 --> 00:54:36,997
VCX-100.

889
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:40,424
That is a quality ship.
Right, boys?

890
00:54:40,518 --> 00:54:42,281
It's the fastest
in the galaxy,

891
00:54:42,283 --> 00:54:43,712
but there's a lot of
great ships out there.

892
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:46,118
I mean, I'm sure
yours is very nice.

893
00:54:46,272 --> 00:54:48,141
Gets me where I'm goin'.

894
00:54:52,535 --> 00:54:53,770
Beginner's luck.

895
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:55,663
Well played.

896
00:55:02,796 --> 00:55:04,792
Let's see what
we got here.

897
00:55:04,794 --> 00:55:06,586
Oh, great hand!

898
00:55:10,284 --> 00:55:13,282
Sorry, guys.
Close, but not quite.

899
00:55:22,897 --> 00:55:25,067
Eyes on
your own cards, buddy.

900
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:27,234
All of 'em.

901
00:55:27,236 --> 00:55:29,160
There.
Well, now I see yours.

902
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:38,601
Oh, that's me?
Okay, let's see...

903
00:55:41,169 --> 00:55:43,132
Sorry, minus two.

904
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:49,754
This game is fun.

905
00:55:49,823 --> 00:55:51,769
All right,
how about this?

906
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:54,434
I'll see your bet
and I'll raise you.

907
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:58,035
2,000.

908
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:03,345
I'll see your 2,000

909
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:05,871
and I'll raise you

910
00:56:06,389 --> 00:56:08,009
however much this is.

911
00:56:10,817 --> 00:56:12,469
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Han.

912
00:56:12,531 --> 00:56:14,060
Slow down.

913
00:56:14,187 --> 00:56:15,770
You might wanna quit
while you're ahead.

914
00:56:15,844 --> 00:56:17,846
You might wanna quit
while you're behind.

915
00:56:19,892 --> 00:56:21,620
I like this kid.

916
00:56:21,692 --> 00:56:22,788
You're adorable.

917
00:56:22,828 --> 00:56:24,190
And I'm serious.

918
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,621
And I'm calling.

919
00:56:26,269 --> 00:56:27,696
With what?

920
00:56:27,736 --> 00:56:28,736
Your scarf?

921
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:29,967
Not my style.

922
00:56:30,007 --> 00:56:31,175
My ship.

923
00:56:32,494 --> 00:56:33,923
Against your ship.

924
00:56:35,872 --> 00:56:37,706
Time to find out
if you got the nerve.

925
00:56:40,763 --> 00:56:42,032
What the hell?

926
00:56:46,048 --> 00:56:47,313
Straight Staves.

927
00:56:57,018 --> 00:56:59,514
You played me.
You're good.

928
00:56:59,577 --> 00:57:01,187
- Yeah.
- You're very good.

929
00:57:01,783 --> 00:57:03,545
But not good enough.

930
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,780
Full Sabacc.

931
00:57:11,396 --> 00:57:13,073
I told you to quit
while you were ahead.

932
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:17,164
Drinks on me!

933
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:22,770
Yeah, that's right.

934
00:57:29,953 --> 00:57:31,274
First of all,
there's no way

935
00:57:31,276 --> 00:57:32,855
he could've had
that green sylop.

936
00:57:32,857 --> 00:57:33,861
They'd all been played.

937
00:57:33,863 --> 00:57:35,592
Also, your guy,
Captain Wonderful,

938
00:57:35,597 --> 00:57:37,038
is so full of bantha crap...

939
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,775
Yoo-hoo!

940
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:42,627
Where's my VCX?

941
00:57:43,038 --> 00:57:44,652
I don't have it
right here now.

942
00:57:44,654 --> 00:57:46,107
It's in the shop.

943
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:48,229
- I'm getting some work done.
- Lando.

944
00:57:49,724 --> 00:57:51,154
Qi'ra.

945
00:57:52,273 --> 00:57:55,370
You look phenomenal.
As always.

946
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:57,372
Well, I knew I was
gonna see you.

947
00:57:58,081 --> 00:57:58,983
Get off!

948
00:57:58,985 --> 00:58:00,412
What are you doing
with hairy and the boy?

949
00:58:00,414 --> 00:58:02,878
- There's no need, none.
- They work for me.

950
00:58:02,977 --> 00:58:04,144
Good help
is hard to find, no?

951
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:05,482
We're more like partners.

952
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,086
We are.

953
00:58:08,313 --> 00:58:09,314
Excuse us.

954
00:58:10,228 --> 00:58:11,562
Listen, last I checked,

955
00:58:11,564 --> 00:58:13,262
me and Crimson Dawn,
we're squared away.

956
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,029
Dryden said
all is forgiven

957
00:58:15,031 --> 00:58:17,238
after I did the whole
Felucia thing for him.

958
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,044
Yeah. New move,
we're making the Kessel Run.

959
00:58:21,763 --> 00:58:23,025
We need a ship.

960
00:58:23,027 --> 00:58:24,354
Why didn't you
just say so?

961
00:58:24,356 --> 00:58:25,599
I thought
you were retired.

962
00:58:27,026 --> 00:58:28,960
Circumstances change.

963
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:30,946
How much?

964
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:32,439
The Kessel Run.

965
00:58:32,507 --> 00:58:35,278
That's no easy spin.
I'm gonna need half the take.

966
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,729
Ridiculous.

967
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:38,904
Grown-ups are talking.

968
00:58:39,136 --> 00:58:40,371
25%.

969
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:46,906
You're Tobias Beckett.

970
00:58:47,696 --> 00:58:49,171
You killed Aurra Sing.

971
00:58:50,287 --> 00:58:52,799
Pushed her. Pretty sure
the fall killed her.

972
00:58:52,801 --> 00:58:55,764
You did the galaxy a favor
that day. Me, especially.

973
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:56,794
I owed her
a lot of money.

974
00:58:56,796 --> 00:58:58,892
And as token
of my gratitude,

975
00:58:59,258 --> 00:59:01,544
I'm willing
to do this for 40%.

976
00:59:04,784 --> 00:59:06,254
25.

977
00:59:11,406 --> 00:59:13,369
25% works.

978
00:59:13,472 --> 00:59:15,880
No! Unacceptable!

979
00:59:16,038 --> 00:59:18,010
Stop exploiting droids!

980
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:20,233
You sloppy degenerate bios!

981
00:59:20,346 --> 00:59:21,924
- She never learns.
- Have you no shame?

982
00:59:21,948 --> 00:59:22,985
Who?

983
00:59:23,037 --> 00:59:23,702
My first mate.

984
00:59:23,704 --> 00:59:26,248
You got no business
being here. Get out of here!

985
00:59:26,288 --> 00:59:29,166
How can you condone
this savagery?

986
00:59:29,264 --> 00:59:31,960
You, you. You should
not be doing this.

987
00:59:31,962 --> 00:59:34,601
They're using you
for entertainment.

988
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:36,467
Yeah. You've
been neurowashed.

989
00:59:36,498 --> 00:59:38,692
Don't just blindly
follow the program.

990
00:59:38,694 --> 00:59:40,714
Exercise some free will!

991
00:59:41,886 --> 00:59:43,383
Stay away from him!

992
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:44,822
He's never
had it so good.

993
00:59:44,888 --> 00:59:47,890
Oh, really? How about you have
a go at me, ya lumpy brute.

994
00:59:47,922 --> 00:59:48,982
Bring it on!
Come on!

995
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:49,904
L3!

996
00:59:49,906 --> 00:59:52,165
Droid rights!
We are sentient!

997
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:54,224
I'm gonna flip your switch.

998
00:59:55,165 --> 00:59:56,344
Good luck finding it.

999
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:57,580
L3!

1000
00:59:59,427 --> 01:00:01,357
Let go
of the mean man's face.

1001
01:00:01,425 --> 01:00:02,230
We're leaving.

1002
01:00:02,276 --> 01:00:04,537
They don't even
serve our kind here.

1003
01:00:04,678 --> 01:00:05,678
Now.

1004
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:10,966
Who are these guys?

1005
01:00:10,968 --> 01:00:12,328
We're taking them
to Kessel.

1006
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,953
Oh, are we?

1007
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,892
And what if I don't elect
to go to Kessel?

1008
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:18,199
Please don't start.

1009
01:00:18,245 --> 01:00:19,858
Or what,
you'll have me wiped?

1010
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,197
You couldn't get from here
to Black Spire without me.

1011
01:00:22,253 --> 01:00:23,710
Now you're gonna
make the Kessel Run?

1012
01:00:23,764 --> 01:00:25,827
If she doesn't wanna fly,
I'll be your co-pilot.

1013
01:00:25,867 --> 01:00:27,596
- I don't mind.
- No, no. It's okay.

1014
01:00:27,941 --> 01:00:29,168
She's definitely going.

1015
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:32,401
Oh, why? Because
you're my organic overlord?

1016
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:34,366
Because I'm your
captain, how about that?

1017
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,910
I actually would have
her memory wiped,

1018
01:00:36,912 --> 01:00:37,730
but she's got
the best damn

1019
01:00:37,732 --> 01:00:39,861
navigational database
in the galaxy.

1020
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,001
Could use a fresh coat
of paint, though!

1021
01:00:42,054 --> 01:00:46,485
Landonis, you do not want to
press that button with me.

1022
01:00:46,677 --> 01:00:49,241
You know, a lot of
ships around here get boosted.

1023
01:00:49,453 --> 01:00:51,696
So, I keep mine locked up.

1024
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,411
You know, for safety.

1025
01:00:54,062 --> 01:00:56,265
L3, do you mind?

1026
01:01:02,328 --> 01:01:03,844
Look away.

1027
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:05,717
I can't perform
with you looking at me.

1028
01:01:05,903 --> 01:01:06,903
Please indulge her.

1029
01:01:14,987 --> 01:01:17,024
I can feel you
looking at me.

1030
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:23,763
What are we
doing here?

1031
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:24,999
This guy's a hustler.

1032
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:26,436
I don't even think
he's got a ship.

1033
01:01:26,438 --> 01:01:28,066
If he does, it's gonna
be a piece of junk

1034
01:01:28,153 --> 01:01:29,060
if it's even here.

1035
01:01:29,062 --> 01:01:31,665
There she is,
my pride and joy.

1036
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:34,142
The <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

1037
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,750
Looks like you had
a little work done.

1038
01:01:51,814 --> 01:01:53,381
Indeed I have, Han.

1039
01:01:53,446 --> 01:01:55,878
Installed an escape pod
in the mandible notch,

1040
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:58,552
alluvial dampers, a wet bar.

1041
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,206
And a fortified infraction

1042
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:02,472
restraint on the landing gear.

1043
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:05,624
Looks to me like they
impounded your ship, Lando.

1044
01:02:06,675 --> 01:02:08,204
This is unbelievable!

1045
01:02:08,565 --> 01:02:09,752
I'm definitely
gonna have some words

1046
01:02:09,754 --> 01:02:11,878
with someone about this.

1047
01:02:13,615 --> 01:02:15,784
You must have experience
with these, right?

1048
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:17,293
Yeah, I could
take it off.

1049
01:02:17,364 --> 01:02:18,520
Fantastic!

1050
01:02:18,523 --> 01:02:20,489
Along with five percent
off your cut.

1051
01:02:21,314 --> 01:02:23,201
You're down to 20.

1052
01:02:25,836 --> 01:02:27,699
I don't like it.

1053
01:02:27,701 --> 01:02:29,136
I don't agree with it.

1054
01:02:30,262 --> 01:02:31,464
But I accept it.

1055
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,610
You're getting
the hang of this, Lando.

1056
01:02:35,321 --> 01:02:36,741
Yeah.

1057
01:02:36,743 --> 01:02:37,941
Come on, Chewie.

1058
01:02:37,943 --> 01:02:40,149
Gonna need a little bit of
that Wookiee oomph.

1059
01:02:42,229 --> 01:02:44,082
<i>Your plan
is underway, Enfys.</i>

1060
01:02:44,142 --> 01:02:45,724
<i>We've attached
the homing beacon.</i>

1061
01:02:45,726 --> 01:02:47,701
<i>They won't elude us now.</i>

1062
01:02:47,776 --> 01:02:48,778
<i>Good.</i>

1063
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:57,400
<i>If they survive, they'll
bring the prize to us.</i>

1064
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,119
This is a Corellian YT-1300.

1065
01:03:15,768 --> 01:03:17,670
Oh. You know your stuff.

1066
01:03:18,243 --> 01:03:19,938
I've been on one before.

1067
01:03:19,994 --> 01:03:20,999
My dad worked the line

1068
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:23,503
at the CEC plant
before he got laid off.

1069
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:25,858
He built these.

1070
01:03:27,113 --> 01:03:29,409
He wanted
to be a pilot, but...

1071
01:03:29,785 --> 01:03:31,788
You, uh,
close with your old man?

1072
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:33,913
Not really.

1073
01:03:34,054 --> 01:03:36,085
Yeah, me neither.

1074
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:38,220
My mom,
on the other hand,

1075
01:03:38,478 --> 01:03:40,430
most amazing woman
I've ever known.

1076
01:03:43,675 --> 01:03:44,828
Excuse me.

1077
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:47,581
Get your presumptuous ass
out of my seat!

1078
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:56,241
My sacral-occipital
circuit is sticking.

1079
01:03:56,524 --> 01:03:58,365
You're gonna have
to do that thing again later.

1080
01:03:58,606 --> 01:04:00,214
Yeah.

1081
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,439
All right, course
to Kessel is set.

1082
01:04:02,501 --> 01:04:04,118
Plugging coordinates
in now.

1083
01:04:04,263 --> 01:04:05,683
Just keep your pinky
on the yoke

1084
01:04:05,738 --> 01:04:06,937
and try not to mess
anything up.

1085
01:04:06,961 --> 01:04:07,922
Whatever you say, my lady.

1086
01:04:07,962 --> 01:04:09,642
Just let me know when
you're ready to jump.

1087
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:11,292
Ready in...

1088
01:04:14,205 --> 01:04:15,206
Ready.

1089
01:04:15,945 --> 01:04:18,461
It's just a simple jump to
hyperspace, and we're there.

1090
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:19,842
What's so tricky about that?

1091
01:04:19,881 --> 01:04:22,253
Plenty. Can't plot
a direct course to Kessel.

1092
01:04:22,308 --> 01:04:23,867
You have to thread through
the Si'Klaata Cluster

1093
01:04:23,891 --> 01:04:26,354
and then pass through
The Maelstrom.

1094
01:04:26,636 --> 01:04:28,305
You done flirting?
I'm still ready.

1095
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,359
You might wanna
buckle up, baby.

1096
01:04:52,132 --> 01:04:53,211
Think.

1097
01:04:53,313 --> 01:04:54,980
Do you wanna
make that move?

1098
01:04:55,123 --> 01:04:57,423
Do you wanna make that move?

1099
01:04:57,478 --> 01:04:59,338
You made that move, okay.

1100
01:04:59,425 --> 01:05:02,189
I guess I have to
destroy that little guy.

1101
01:05:02,229 --> 01:05:04,372
Somehow I never
get bored with winning.

1102
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:08,426
No, you can't wipe 'em off.
They're holograms.

1103
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:11,505
Hey, hey, hey!
Chewie, relax!

1104
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,658
Hey, try to compose yourself.

1105
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,039
Look. All you gotta do is
think a few moves ahead,

1106
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,374
anticipate your opponent.

1107
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,809
There's a lesson
to be learned here.

1108
01:05:19,881 --> 01:05:21,117
Uh, you guys seen Qi'ra?

1109
01:05:23,984 --> 01:05:25,791
People are predictable.

1110
01:05:47,451 --> 01:05:49,713
Yeah, I had to
try one on.

1111
01:05:49,847 --> 01:05:51,282
That's a lot of capes.

1112
01:05:51,353 --> 01:05:53,362
Maybe too many capes.

1113
01:05:57,763 --> 01:05:59,391
So what's the plan?

1114
01:05:59,479 --> 01:06:00,994
Well, I thought
we'd talk a little first

1115
01:06:00,996 --> 01:06:02,853
and then you know...

1116
01:06:02,855 --> 01:06:04,859
- For Kessel.
- Oh.

1117
01:06:04,952 --> 01:06:06,468
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

1118
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,102
Yeah? How good?

1119
01:06:08,484 --> 01:06:09,271
Foolproof.

1120
01:06:09,311 --> 01:06:11,072
Well, it better be.

1121
01:06:11,332 --> 01:06:12,141
- I...
- I...

1122
01:06:12,241 --> 01:06:13,425
- You go first.
- No.

1123
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:15,077
What were you gonna say?

1124
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:18,063
I wanna tell you
so much.

1125
01:06:18,548 --> 01:06:20,117
And I wanna know
everything

1126
01:06:20,157 --> 01:06:21,872
that's happened to you
since Corellia.

1127
01:06:23,293 --> 01:06:25,868
I'm not sure
we have that kinda time.

1128
01:06:26,017 --> 01:06:27,125
We could.

1129
01:06:27,165 --> 01:06:29,546
We could have all the time
we want after the job.

1130
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:30,704
You and I.

1131
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:32,370
What?

1132
01:06:33,342 --> 01:06:34,677
I want to.

1133
01:06:35,567 --> 01:06:36,736
You want to?

1134
01:06:37,018 --> 01:06:38,888
To tell you everything
that's happened.

1135
01:06:40,548 --> 01:06:42,811
But I know if I do,
you won't look at me the same.

1136
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,840
The way that you're
looking at me right now.

1137
01:06:44,957 --> 01:06:46,302
Nothing is gonna
change the way

1138
01:06:46,304 --> 01:06:47,152
I'm looking at you
right now.

1139
01:06:47,154 --> 01:06:49,639
You don't know that.
You don't know what I've done.

1140
01:07:03,454 --> 01:07:05,016
Am I interrupting something?

1141
01:07:07,693 --> 01:07:08,693
Kinda.

1142
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:10,184
Good.

1143
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:12,547
'Cause we got
a lot of work to do.

1144
01:07:12,587 --> 01:07:14,134
You're making
a big mistake.

1145
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:15,263
- Oh, really?
- Which is yours to make

1146
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:17,486
except when you start to
interfere with my livelihood.

1147
01:07:17,526 --> 01:07:18,570
This isn't gonna interfere
with your livelihood.

1148
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:19,555
Then we have a problem.

1149
01:07:19,595 --> 01:07:22,052
You don't see it,
because you don't want to.

1150
01:07:22,054 --> 01:07:23,815
Maybe I know her
a little better than you do.

1151
01:07:24,092 --> 01:07:26,561
Maybe you don't know
her well enough.

1152
01:07:27,428 --> 01:07:28,132
All right?

1153
01:07:28,297 --> 01:07:29,700
Look.

1154
01:07:30,372 --> 01:07:31,870
I like you, kid.

1155
01:07:31,986 --> 01:07:34,458
We got a good thing going here.
Me, you, Chewie.

1156
01:07:34,522 --> 01:07:35,409
- Yeah.
- Right?

1157
01:07:35,411 --> 01:07:37,668
The makings
of a solid crew.

1158
01:07:37,782 --> 01:07:39,843
But it does not work
with Qi'ra.

1159
01:07:40,063 --> 01:07:42,298
It worked with Val.
You trusted her.

1160
01:07:44,248 --> 01:07:47,003
You wanna know how I've
survived as long as I have?

1161
01:07:47,899 --> 01:07:49,263
I trust no one.

1162
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:53,157
Assume everyone
will betray you

1163
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:55,037
and you will never
be disappointed.

1164
01:07:56,397 --> 01:07:58,365
Sounds like
a lonely way to live.

1165
01:07:59,261 --> 01:08:00,897
It's the only way.

1166
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,641
Dropping out
of lightspeed now.

1167
01:08:09,665 --> 01:08:10,665
Ready to...

1168
01:08:16,106 --> 01:08:18,074
The Akkadese Maelstrom.

1169
01:08:20,077 --> 01:08:21,672
I'm gonna go check
on the dampers.

1170
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:22,640
You need anything?

1171
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,049
Equal rights?

1172
01:08:54,328 --> 01:08:55,423
What's that sound?

1173
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,680
Carbonbergs, size of planets,
crashing into each other.

1174
01:08:58,682 --> 01:09:01,208
Ships fly in there,
they never come out.

1175
01:09:01,264 --> 01:09:03,259
It's ionized gas,
water vapor,

1176
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:05,040
possibly vacuum-breathing
life forms

1177
01:09:05,132 --> 01:09:06,481
swirling around The Maw.

1178
01:09:06,554 --> 01:09:08,466
Only way in or out
is this channel.

1179
01:09:10,171 --> 01:09:12,407
So what are you gonna do
about your little problem?

1180
01:09:12,808 --> 01:09:13,942
Problem?

1181
01:09:14,136 --> 01:09:15,507
Uh...

1182
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:16,913
Well, that brand
on your wrist

1183
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,008
tells me that
you're committed.

1184
01:09:19,048 --> 01:09:20,944
And that young male's
heart fluctuations

1185
01:09:20,984 --> 01:09:22,351
tell me
he's in love with you.

1186
01:09:22,421 --> 01:09:25,015
Han is not in love with me!

1187
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:28,229
Oh, please. It's just us.

1188
01:09:28,273 --> 01:09:31,839
You don't have to pretend.
I'm in the same situation.

1189
01:09:31,949 --> 01:09:32,712
You are?

1190
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:33,727
I'm sure you've noticed

1191
01:09:33,729 --> 01:09:35,200
that Lando
has feelings for me.

1192
01:09:35,202 --> 01:09:36,738
Which makes
working together difficult

1193
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:39,187
because I do not feel
the same way about him.

1194
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:40,584
Right.

1195
01:09:40,675 --> 01:09:42,353
Yes, yeah.

1196
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:43,893
Yeah, I see that.

1197
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,715
Sometimes, I think...
Maybe.

1198
01:09:47,445 --> 01:09:48,781
But, no.

1199
01:09:50,723 --> 01:09:52,289
We're just not compatible.

1200
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,948
How would that work?

1201
01:09:56,783 --> 01:09:57,784
It works.

1202
01:10:07,932 --> 01:10:09,962
This is a precision job.

1203
01:10:09,964 --> 01:10:12,583
Thermal vault will be
on the lowest level.

1204
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:13,995
Down where it's warm.

1205
01:10:13,997 --> 01:10:16,518
The only way
we're gonna pull this off

1206
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,725
is if everybody
plays their part.

1207
01:10:18,727 --> 01:10:20,579
Stick to the plan.

1208
01:10:20,581 --> 01:10:22,716
Do not improvise.

1209
01:10:27,484 --> 01:10:29,656
Mining colonies
are the worst.

1210
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:31,275
Yeah, well, "the worst"

1211
01:10:31,277 --> 01:10:32,922
is where the money is.

1212
01:10:35,087 --> 01:10:37,298
All right, people.
Time to shine.

1213
01:11:13,783 --> 01:11:15,664
It won't be for long.

1214
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:17,595
Shut up, the both of you.

1215
01:11:17,597 --> 01:11:19,356
I am Oksana Floren,

1216
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,817
Deputy Assistant Administrator
to the Vice-Admiral

1217
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,670
of the Federation of
Trade Route Allocation

1218
01:11:24,705 --> 01:11:26,183
and Monetization.

1219
01:11:26,299 --> 01:11:28,679
Here with an offer
from his eminence,

1220
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:30,732
the Senior Vice-Admiral.

1221
01:11:31,507 --> 01:11:34,371
Your spice for our
hard-working slaves.

1222
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:35,934
I brought you a sample.

1223
01:11:36,027 --> 01:11:38,697
Tuul, bring forth
the merchandise.

1224
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,253
Director Tolsite
said our slaves

1225
01:12:09,255 --> 01:12:10,446
should follow those guys

1226
01:12:10,448 --> 01:12:12,305
to get clipped
and tagged.

1227
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:14,492
What are they
clipping?

1228
01:12:14,551 --> 01:12:16,654
Mmm-hmm.

1229
01:12:18,249 --> 01:12:19,704
He wants us
to follow him.

1230
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:24,499
Really?

1231
01:12:24,501 --> 01:12:25,798
That's for that stunt
you pulled earlier,

1232
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,190
you degenerate scum.

1233
01:12:46,722 --> 01:12:48,393
He says all systems
in this sector

1234
01:12:48,395 --> 01:12:50,528
of the facility operate
out of this room.

1235
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:52,225
It's how they're able
to maintain control

1236
01:12:52,227 --> 01:12:54,184
over so many
with so few.

1237
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:00,333
The director says
their reconditioning process

1238
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:02,726
is excruciating
but effective.

1239
01:13:17,903 --> 01:13:20,243
He said your security attache
can wait there.

1240
01:13:20,335 --> 01:13:22,603
"Surely, we don't need him
to negotiate."

1241
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:26,811
Wait there, Tuul.

1242
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:28,610
Try not to bother anyone.

1243
01:13:53,481 --> 01:13:54,583
Nice!

1244
01:13:55,253 --> 01:13:56,047
That was the uniform

1245
01:13:56,049 --> 01:13:58,630
that would've fit me
perfectly, but it's fine.

1246
01:14:08,078 --> 01:14:09,880
Would you mind
holding this for me?

1247
01:14:24,312 --> 01:14:25,606
Whoa.

1248
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:27,519
I have never see anyone do...

1249
01:14:27,557 --> 01:14:28,517
What was that?

1250
01:14:28,519 --> 01:14:30,716
Teras Kasi.

1251
01:14:32,263 --> 01:14:33,911
Dryden taught me.

1252
01:14:38,444 --> 01:14:39,549
Ah.

1253
01:14:39,551 --> 01:14:40,817
Well negotiated.

1254
01:14:50,973 --> 01:14:53,141
Excuse me.
I need to use this terminal.

1255
01:14:53,232 --> 01:14:54,233
Hello?

1256
01:14:55,483 --> 01:14:58,007
Can you hear me? Ugh.

1257
01:14:58,394 --> 01:15:00,072
Restraining bolts...

1258
01:15:00,153 --> 01:15:01,363
Barbaric.

1259
01:15:03,328 --> 01:15:05,245
Congratulations!
You're liberated. Scoot.

1260
01:15:05,249 --> 01:15:06,277
I don't know.

1261
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:07,725
Free your brothers and sisters
or something.

1262
01:15:07,749 --> 01:15:09,320
Just give me some space.

1263
01:15:15,346 --> 01:15:16,625
I'm in!

1264
01:15:16,627 --> 01:15:17,693
<i>Han, can you hear me?</i>

1265
01:15:17,695 --> 01:15:19,536
I kinda need to
know which way to go here.

1266
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:20,582
L3?

1267
01:15:20,622 --> 01:15:22,304
The thermal vault
is down two levels,

1268
01:15:22,306 --> 01:15:24,319
then left, then right,
then it's the third left.

1269
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:27,363
Right. That's a lot of
directions, but we're on it.

1270
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,498
They're in subsector four,

1271
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,949
coming up on gate X-3-7-1-K.

1272
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:39,187
Overriding!

1273
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:46,507
Freedom.

1274
01:16:09,113 --> 01:16:11,175
What the hell
are you guys doing up there?

1275
01:16:11,349 --> 01:16:13,252
I created a distraction!

1276
01:16:18,114 --> 01:16:19,366
Come on! This way!

1277
01:16:21,871 --> 01:16:23,743
Wait! What are you doing?

1278
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,604
Come on,
we gotta get the coaxium.

1279
01:16:27,908 --> 01:16:30,266
Hey! Remember what Beckett
said, stick to the plan.

1280
01:16:30,268 --> 01:16:33,206
Chewie! Come on, let's go!

1281
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,800
Fine!

1282
01:16:40,088 --> 01:16:41,156
Chewie!

1283
01:16:43,819 --> 01:16:45,317
Here, you might need this.

1284
01:16:50,421 --> 01:16:52,423
Hope I see you around
sometime.

1285
01:17:08,153 --> 01:17:09,448
Han, where are you?

1286
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:11,286
<i>I'm on my way
to the vault.</i>

1287
01:17:11,389 --> 01:17:12,561
<i>I lost Chewie.</i>

1288
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:13,637
He's dead?

1289
01:17:13,639 --> 01:17:15,492
No, he had something
he had to do.

1290
01:17:15,494 --> 01:17:16,755
<i>Is he coming back?</i>

1291
01:17:16,795 --> 01:17:17,803
I don't know.

1292
01:17:19,089 --> 01:17:21,092
Okay, they're on to us now.

1293
01:17:30,923 --> 01:17:31,990
I'm at the vault.

1294
01:17:39,815 --> 01:17:41,310
That's what I said!

1295
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:46,661
- Huh, that was impressive.
- Yeah.

1296
01:17:46,983 --> 01:17:47,983
We're clear.

1297
01:17:58,545 --> 01:17:59,674
Now what?

1298
01:17:59,886 --> 01:18:01,616
<i>Han, each canister
should be equipped</i>

1299
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:02,876
<i>with a thermal display.</i>

1300
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:04,058
Yeah, I see it.

1301
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:07,190
If the internal temperature
reaches below 35 standard,

1302
01:18:07,192 --> 01:18:10,323
<i>then the coaxium will
destabilize and explode.</i>

1303
01:18:10,325 --> 01:18:12,812
Yup, I get it, guys.
It's dangerous.

1304
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:23,252
Okay, got it.

1305
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:25,067
Great. Only eleven more.

1306
01:18:25,512 --> 01:18:26,513
Eleven?

1307
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,973
The Calrissian Chronicles,
<i>chapter five.</i>

1308
01:18:37,169 --> 01:18:38,688
<i>continued.</i>

1309
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:40,750
Personally, I wasn't all that
impressed with the Sharu.

1310
01:18:40,752 --> 01:18:43,141
No sense of humor or style.

1311
01:18:43,143 --> 01:18:45,293
Nonetheless,
there L3 and I were

1312
01:18:45,296 --> 01:18:47,157
deep in their sacred temple.

1313
01:18:47,215 --> 01:18:49,010
And that's when we saw it...

1314
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:53,094
Always something.

1315
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:57,436
You guys are not gonna believe
what I'm seeing up here.

1316
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:59,469
<i>Is it
a mass breakout?</i>

1317
01:18:59,946 --> 01:19:00,921
L3, what did you do?

1318
01:19:00,923 --> 01:19:03,019
I found my true purpose,
Lando.

1319
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:04,338
That's what I've done.

1320
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:08,282
I'm so glad
we took this job!

1321
01:19:08,284 --> 01:19:09,755
That droid!

1322
01:19:09,757 --> 01:19:10,917
L3, come on!

1323
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,799
Follow me, compatriots!

1324
01:19:23,073 --> 01:19:24,951
Another couple guards
just spotted me.

1325
01:19:24,953 --> 01:19:26,904
I don't have a free hand
to take 'em out.

1326
01:19:26,906 --> 01:19:28,627
- What do I do?
<i>- Improvise.</i>

1327
01:19:28,683 --> 01:19:30,585
You said never improvise!

1328
01:19:39,246 --> 01:19:40,630
Hi!

1329
01:19:40,685 --> 01:19:41,793
Don't forget that guy!

1330
01:19:58,028 --> 01:19:59,983
Good to see you, buddy!

1331
01:20:00,172 --> 01:20:02,254
Stay with me, Sagwa!
Keep up!

1332
01:20:05,628 --> 01:20:07,371
Hey! I'm Chewie's
friend, Han.

1333
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:11,105
Okay.

1334
01:20:38,407 --> 01:20:40,543
Han!

1335
01:20:42,268 --> 01:20:43,269
Hey!

1336
01:20:54,548 --> 01:20:55,637
Follow me.

1337
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,434
Rebellion!

1338
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:12,076
They're going for
the landing gear!

1339
01:21:12,078 --> 01:21:13,421
We've gotta
get out of here!

1340
01:21:15,283 --> 01:21:17,773
We need to keep 'em away
from those cannons!

1341
01:21:25,877 --> 01:21:27,078
Catch that!

1342
01:21:29,575 --> 01:21:31,420
Coaxium's stowed!
Let's go!

1343
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:33,236
Where's L3?

1344
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,352
No more subjugation!

1345
01:21:40,482 --> 01:21:41,790
L3!

1346
01:21:41,799 --> 01:21:43,802
No, Lando!
Get back here!

1347
01:21:46,457 --> 01:21:47,760
Lando!

1348
01:21:48,815 --> 01:21:50,491
System failure.

1349
01:21:50,493 --> 01:21:52,732
Have to reroute
the sensory modulators.

1350
01:21:52,796 --> 01:21:54,413
It's all right.
Save your energy.

1351
01:21:54,415 --> 01:21:56,179
I'm gonna get you outta here.
All right?

1352
01:21:56,181 --> 01:21:57,816
System failure...

1353
01:22:03,371 --> 01:22:04,521
Rerouting...

1354
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:07,204
Damn it!

1355
01:22:07,206 --> 01:22:08,206
Han!

1356
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:15,062
Sagwa.

1357
01:22:15,123 --> 01:22:16,558
This way!

1358
01:22:17,313 --> 01:22:18,718
Come, come!

1359
01:22:28,956 --> 01:22:30,624
Chewie!
Damn it!

1360
01:22:34,441 --> 01:22:35,810
It's not responding.

1361
01:22:53,081 --> 01:22:55,184
What are you
standing around for? Come on!

1362
01:23:00,954 --> 01:23:02,512
It's okay,
you'll be fine.

1363
01:23:04,226 --> 01:23:06,128
It's not responding...
Not responding...

1364
01:23:06,722 --> 01:23:07,957
Han, get us out of here.

1365
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:09,814
It's not responding.

1366
01:23:09,816 --> 01:23:11,177
Han! Now!

1367
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:12,861
On it.

1368
01:23:41,062 --> 01:23:42,282
- Lando...
- I'm here.

1369
01:23:42,799 --> 01:23:44,561
- It's all right, L3.
- Lando...

1370
01:23:44,563 --> 01:23:45,714
- I've got you.
- This is not...

1371
01:23:45,716 --> 01:23:47,274
- It's okay, L3.
- Lando.

1372
01:23:47,276 --> 01:23:49,709
It's all right. I can fix you.
I can fix you.

1373
01:23:49,914 --> 01:23:51,114
Lando.

1374
01:23:51,116 --> 01:23:53,167
What's happening to me?

1375
01:23:55,869 --> 01:23:57,103
L3?

1376
01:23:57,803 --> 01:23:58,872
L3!

1377
01:24:05,992 --> 01:24:08,247
I'm sorry, girl.

1378
01:24:08,249 --> 01:24:09,850
I'm so sorry.

1379
01:24:23,733 --> 01:24:25,036
I could use a co-pilot.

1380
01:24:49,425 --> 01:24:50,860
Sorry.

1381
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:54,662
With the cargo
we're carrying,

1382
01:24:54,664 --> 01:24:55,889
if we don't make up
some lost time

1383
01:24:55,891 --> 01:24:58,255
we're gonna be
in real trouble.

1384
01:24:58,376 --> 01:24:59,902
How about that?
Is that real trouble?

1385
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:08,862
That is an Imperial blockade.

1386
01:25:08,864 --> 01:25:10,541
What's it doing here?

1387
01:25:10,543 --> 01:25:12,533
Probably heard about
your little rebellion.

1388
01:25:14,246 --> 01:25:16,077
Nope.
Not gonna make it.

1389
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:17,309
We're gonna have to
drop the shipment.

1390
01:25:17,311 --> 01:25:19,825
If we don't deliver,
Dryden will kill us.

1391
01:25:19,827 --> 01:25:21,523
All right, trust me,
I know these guys.

1392
01:25:21,525 --> 01:25:22,788
I used to be one of 'em.

1393
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:24,718
There's no way they're
gonna waste a TIE fighter

1394
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,650
chasing down a little
rinky-dink freighter.

1395
01:25:31,505 --> 01:25:32,228
You were saying?

1396
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:33,770
Usually,
in situations like this

1397
01:25:33,772 --> 01:25:35,898
I like to turn around
in the opposite direction.

1398
01:25:45,061 --> 01:25:46,562
I'm on the ventral gun.

1399
01:25:51,932 --> 01:25:53,142
It's an easy equation.

1400
01:25:53,144 --> 01:25:55,174
We simply don't have enough
time to get to Savareen

1401
01:25:55,176 --> 01:25:56,397
before the canisters explode!

1402
01:25:56,399 --> 01:25:57,773
Just have to find
a faster route.

1403
01:25:57,775 --> 01:25:58,875
There isn't one!
You can't make

1404
01:25:58,877 --> 01:26:00,662
the Kessel Run
in less than 20 parsecs.

1405
01:26:00,664 --> 01:26:02,145
- Watch me.
- How?

1406
01:26:02,201 --> 01:26:04,085
Take a shortcut,
through there.

1407
01:26:05,012 --> 01:26:07,082
- Into The Maelstrom?
- Mmm-hmm.

1408
01:26:07,084 --> 01:26:09,137
Spectacular way of killing
us all, I'll give you that.

1409
01:26:09,139 --> 01:26:11,027
- Can't do it without L3.
- She's gone!

1410
01:26:11,029 --> 01:26:12,418
You said yourself
she's got the best

1411
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:14,010
navigational database
in the galaxy.

1412
01:26:14,012 --> 01:26:15,191
If we remove
her neural core,

1413
01:26:15,193 --> 01:26:16,565
it's possible we can
download her brain

1414
01:26:16,567 --> 01:26:18,715
into the <i>Falcon's</i>
navicomputer, right?

1415
01:26:18,794 --> 01:26:19,795
Could we?

1416
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,351
Theoretically.

1417
01:26:21,353 --> 01:26:23,021
Only one way to find out.

1418
01:26:25,897 --> 01:26:27,865
I got a really good feeling
about this.

1419
01:26:42,283 --> 01:26:43,749
Oops, that's on me.

1420
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:52,174
Okay.

1421
01:26:54,282 --> 01:26:56,125
Beckett, you see them?
They still on us?

1422
01:26:59,332 --> 01:27:00,702
<i>Beckett, did you hear me?</i>

1423
01:27:00,704 --> 01:27:01,965
<i>Are they on us?</i>

1424
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:04,050
Like rashnold on a kalak.

1425
01:27:04,931 --> 01:27:06,430
I don't know
what that means.

1426
01:27:06,461 --> 01:27:08,691
Like a gingleson's pelt.

1427
01:27:08,943 --> 01:27:10,663
What?
Are they or aren't they?

1428
01:27:10,665 --> 01:27:12,480
Yes, they're still on us!

1429
01:27:14,622 --> 01:27:15,822
Whoo!

1430
01:27:19,182 --> 01:27:23,999
This is why you never let
anyone fly your ship.

1431
01:27:24,037 --> 01:27:25,073
Come on!

1432
01:27:29,348 --> 01:27:32,028
Yeah, one just got past me.
He's right on top of us!

1433
01:27:41,663 --> 01:27:43,032
<i>Good going, Han!</i>

1434
01:27:49,036 --> 01:27:50,316
We need to
divert auxiliary power

1435
01:27:50,318 --> 01:27:51,569
to the rear deflector shield.

1436
01:27:51,571 --> 01:27:54,469
We definitely do!

1437
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:02,898
Since when do you know
how to fly?

1438
01:28:05,372 --> 01:28:07,035
190 years old?

1439
01:28:08,912 --> 01:28:10,139
You look great!

1440
01:28:11,348 --> 01:28:12,610
Chewie, get in.

1441
01:28:12,665 --> 01:28:13,746
I'll help Lando.

1442
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:31,024
Whoa!
That's my cape!

1443
01:28:31,026 --> 01:28:32,803
Ah! That's a custom piece!

1444
01:28:40,322 --> 01:28:42,253
What? Beckett, you with us?

1445
01:28:42,255 --> 01:28:44,611
We just lost the cannon!

1446
01:28:44,613 --> 01:28:46,576
And I really hurt
my thumbs.

1447
01:28:46,663 --> 01:28:48,097
<i>There's still one on us.</i>

1448
01:28:54,108 --> 01:28:55,544
Drop the landing gear.

1449
01:28:56,074 --> 01:28:57,546
When I tell you,
flood the intake

1450
01:28:57,548 --> 01:28:59,081
and sweep to the bi-lats.

1451
01:29:02,776 --> 01:29:05,427
A little something I picked up
from my pal, Needles,

1452
01:29:05,429 --> 01:29:07,378
best street racer
in all of Corellia.

1453
01:29:08,449 --> 01:29:09,776
Till he crashed

1454
01:29:09,903 --> 01:29:12,235
and died, doing this.

1455
01:29:30,068 --> 01:29:31,702
Flood it, it's all yours!

1456
01:29:43,472 --> 01:29:45,802
Nice move!

1457
01:29:48,814 --> 01:29:50,515
Pull out her
internal processor.

1458
01:29:53,526 --> 01:29:54,526
Sorry.

1459
01:30:01,014 --> 01:30:02,138
We've got L3.

1460
01:30:04,146 --> 01:30:05,661
Remove the mod calibrator.

1461
01:30:05,663 --> 01:30:06,756
Make sure
the T-Line's connected.

1462
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,412
I'm gonna tuck it in.
Don't worry.

1463
01:30:08,483 --> 01:30:09,446
You close?

1464
01:30:09,448 --> 01:30:11,913
That coaxium's
getting real ripe.

1465
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:14,284
Okay.

1466
01:30:16,182 --> 01:30:17,885
She's interfacing.

1467
01:30:21,989 --> 01:30:23,892
She's part of the ship now.

1468
01:30:35,474 --> 01:30:36,947
Where the hell are we?

1469
01:30:36,991 --> 01:30:38,359
We're way off
the edge of the map.

1470
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:40,078
Wait.

1471
01:30:40,134 --> 01:30:42,771
L3's constructing a model
of The Maelstrom.

1472
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:47,671
She says we're
approaching The Maw.

1473
01:30:47,712 --> 01:30:48,841
That doesn't
sound like something

1474
01:30:48,843 --> 01:30:50,349
we wanna be approaching.

1475
01:31:11,414 --> 01:31:12,414
Hang on!

1476
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:18,809
This is The Maw?

1477
01:31:18,811 --> 01:31:20,855
No, that's not The Maw.
I don't know what this is.

1478
01:31:20,857 --> 01:31:22,092
That's a living thing.

1479
01:31:36,817 --> 01:31:38,112
There!

1480
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:39,291
That's The Maw.

1481
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:43,675
It's a gravity well.

1482
01:31:43,895 --> 01:31:44,973
I got an idea.

1483
01:31:46,122 --> 01:31:47,903
Don't fly toward it, Han!

1484
01:31:55,562 --> 01:31:56,835
See if it goes for this.

1485
01:31:56,837 --> 01:31:58,672
No, what are you doing?
That's the escape pod!

1486
01:32:00,141 --> 01:32:01,309
I know.

1487
01:32:04,347 --> 01:32:05,617
Then why'd you do it?

1488
01:32:13,037 --> 01:32:14,405
That's why, baby.

1489
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:24,494
She found a way out.

1490
01:32:25,241 --> 01:32:27,854
90 degrees,
to the left... ish.

1491
01:32:27,926 --> 01:32:28,855
Left-ish.

1492
01:32:28,942 --> 01:32:30,221
I can't.

1493
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:32,140
It's taking everything we got
to stay out of The Maw.

1494
01:32:32,164 --> 01:32:33,798
It's pulling us in.
We're stuck.

1495
01:32:37,762 --> 01:32:40,218
We have enough raw coaxium
to power a dozen destroyers.

1496
01:32:40,274 --> 01:32:42,212
Inject it into the fuel line,
it'll blow up the ship.

1497
01:32:42,214 --> 01:32:43,645
Not the fuel line.

1498
01:32:43,647 --> 01:32:45,889
But if we put one drop
into the fusion reactor,

1499
01:32:45,944 --> 01:32:46,451
it might just...

1500
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:47,916
Give us the kick we need.

1501
01:32:47,957 --> 01:32:49,724
All right, I'm on it!

1502
01:32:54,147 --> 01:32:55,908
I know, we're getting
dragged in a circle.

1503
01:33:09,979 --> 01:33:12,219
Once we get lined up,
it's gonna be a straight shot.

1504
01:33:12,297 --> 01:33:13,340
As soon as that
coaxium ignites,

1505
01:33:13,364 --> 01:33:14,169
we're gonna
tear out of here

1506
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:15,745
and the second we're
clear of The Maelstrom,

1507
01:33:15,747 --> 01:33:17,138
we jump to lightspeed.

1508
01:33:21,125 --> 01:33:22,273
Beckett!

1509
01:33:22,275 --> 01:33:23,677
Can't talk!

1510
01:33:27,626 --> 01:33:28,660
I see it.

1511
01:33:53,205 --> 01:33:54,145
Beckett, hurry up!

1512
01:33:54,147 --> 01:33:56,210
We only get one shot
at this thing!

1513
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:58,475
Shut up
and let me do this!

1514
01:34:06,721 --> 01:34:09,323
Beckett, I'm gonna
count you down!

1515
01:34:10,338 --> 01:34:11,672
Three!

1516
01:34:14,593 --> 01:34:15,628
Two!

1517
01:34:19,715 --> 01:34:20,853
Now!

1518
01:34:20,922 --> 01:34:21,951
Now?

1519
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:23,031
Now!

1520
01:34:39,037 --> 01:34:40,805
Oh, shoot...

1521
01:34:53,556 --> 01:34:55,006
Chewie, when I tell you,
kick out the thrusters

1522
01:34:55,008 --> 01:34:56,742
- and jump to lightspeed.
- Wait, what are we...

1523
01:34:56,744 --> 01:34:57,946
Remember that alley
we slipped through

1524
01:34:57,948 --> 01:34:59,108
in the Santhe Shipyards?

1525
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:01,159
Yeah, I remember!
I remember it didn't work.

1526
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:02,463
This time it's gonna.

1527
01:35:12,675 --> 01:35:13,676
Punch it!

1528
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:26,792
<i>Savareen,
this is</i> Millennium Falcon.

1529
01:35:26,794 --> 01:35:29,697
<i>We have coaxium that needs to
be off-loaded immediately.</i>

1530
01:35:29,699 --> 01:35:32,137
<i>Like immediately,
immediately!</i>

1531
01:35:33,044 --> 01:35:34,373
<i>We're here now...</i>

1532
01:35:34,632 --> 01:35:35,733
<i>...see you. I...</i>

1533
01:36:06,721 --> 01:36:08,934
Just did the Kessel Run
in 12 parsecs.

1534
01:36:13,177 --> 01:36:15,117
Not if you round down, buddy.

1535
01:36:15,472 --> 01:36:16,473
Yeah.

1536
01:36:22,537 --> 01:36:24,807
She is a hell of a ship.

1537
01:36:33,407 --> 01:36:34,869
I hate you.

1538
01:36:34,933 --> 01:36:36,401
I know.

1539
01:36:38,781 --> 01:36:40,778
I'm gonna be on my ship,

1540
01:36:40,943 --> 01:36:42,737
in my quarters,

1541
01:36:42,739 --> 01:36:45,811
waiting for you
to bring me my share.

1542
01:36:48,019 --> 01:36:50,457
And then I don't ever
wanna see you again.

1543
01:36:55,074 --> 01:36:56,475
Never?

1544
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:12,168
Where's your boss?

1545
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:14,678
Oh. Don't worry.
He'll be here.

1546
01:37:15,921 --> 01:37:16,921
Then what?

1547
01:37:17,357 --> 01:37:20,153
Well, you delivered,

1548
01:37:20,452 --> 01:37:22,448
so you will get paid.

1549
01:37:22,722 --> 01:37:25,114
You can buy that ship.

1550
01:37:25,176 --> 01:37:28,346
You know that's not
what I'm asking.

1551
01:37:31,017 --> 01:37:32,653
It can't happen.

1552
01:37:36,914 --> 01:37:38,299
Because you're with Dryden?

1553
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:41,413
I'm not with him,
but I owe him.

1554
01:37:43,142 --> 01:37:45,178
He helped me out
of a bad situation.

1555
01:37:46,395 --> 01:37:48,425
And how long do you have
to pay off that debt?

1556
01:37:51,903 --> 01:37:54,506
Everyone serves
somebody, Han.

1557
01:37:55,359 --> 01:37:57,682
Even Dryden Vos.

1558
01:37:57,728 --> 01:38:00,504
Look, you don't want to make
an enemy of Crimson Dawn

1559
01:38:00,506 --> 01:38:02,955
which is exactly what you
and I would both be doing

1560
01:38:02,957 --> 01:38:04,448
if I left here with you.

1561
01:38:04,450 --> 01:38:06,291
I'm not afraid
of Crimson Dawn.

1562
01:38:06,293 --> 01:38:08,424
I can take care of myself.

1563
01:38:08,664 --> 01:38:10,036
You know,
I'm not the kid you knew

1564
01:38:10,038 --> 01:38:11,607
on Corellia anymore, Qi'ra.

1565
01:38:11,653 --> 01:38:12,740
- No?
- No.

1566
01:38:12,742 --> 01:38:13,809
Then who are you?

1567
01:38:14,795 --> 01:38:16,142
I'm an outlaw.

1568
01:38:18,044 --> 01:38:19,324
What? I'm not kidding.

1569
01:38:19,417 --> 01:38:20,634
Okay.

1570
01:38:20,636 --> 01:38:23,528
Okay, outlaw,
you can tell yourself that,

1571
01:38:23,677 --> 01:38:25,882
but I might be the only person
in the whole galaxy

1572
01:38:25,884 --> 01:38:27,431
who knows
what you really are.

1573
01:38:27,433 --> 01:38:29,328
Yeah.

1574
01:38:29,330 --> 01:38:30,666
What's that?

1575
01:38:33,072 --> 01:38:34,576
You are the good guy.

1576
01:38:36,764 --> 01:38:39,527
I am not the good guy.

1577
01:38:39,529 --> 01:38:43,193
I am definitely
not a good guy.

1578
01:38:43,435 --> 01:38:44,867
I'm a terrible person.

1579
01:38:45,414 --> 01:38:46,791
Hey!

1580
01:38:46,793 --> 01:38:48,378
They say when
the coaxium's refined,

1581
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:49,928
we collect it up there.

1582
01:39:14,468 --> 01:39:16,561
So, I hear
you make good brandy.

1583
01:39:19,978 --> 01:39:21,413
<i>Beckett.</i>

1584
01:39:46,144 --> 01:39:47,212
Don't.

1585
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:51,150
<i>You must've known
you'd see me again.</i>

1586
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:52,681
I was counting on it.

1587
01:39:52,683 --> 01:39:54,998
Just didn't plan on it
being so soon.

1588
01:39:56,147 --> 01:39:57,981
Of course now,
you've got a problem.

1589
01:39:58,025 --> 01:39:59,928
Big problem.

1590
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:06,156
You happen to notice
that freighter down there?

1591
01:40:06,297 --> 01:40:08,365
You know what's on it?

1592
01:40:08,413 --> 01:40:10,260
About 30 hired guns.

1593
01:40:10,262 --> 01:40:12,473
All I gotta do
is give 'em the signal,

1594
01:40:12,475 --> 01:40:13,711
you're surrounded.

1595
01:40:29,765 --> 01:40:31,767
Sorry.
You do your thing.

1596
01:40:33,099 --> 01:40:35,442
By the time that coaxium
gets refined,

1597
01:40:35,444 --> 01:40:37,244
Crimson Dawn will be here,

1598
01:40:37,246 --> 01:40:39,250
so you go ahead
and kill us.

1599
01:40:39,252 --> 01:40:41,147
They're gonna kill you.

1600
01:40:41,149 --> 01:40:42,578
Perhaps
there's a compromise,

1601
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:44,371
one that doesn't involve
so much killing.

1602
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:46,735
They're marauders.

1603
01:40:46,737 --> 01:40:48,873
They don't care
about anybody.

1604
01:40:49,781 --> 01:40:51,683
All they know
how to do is kill.

1605
01:41:15,192 --> 01:41:16,627
I need a drink.

1606
01:41:17,115 --> 01:41:18,650
Bring them inside.

1607
01:41:30,716 --> 01:41:32,651
My mother once told me

1608
01:41:32,653 --> 01:41:34,011
about a band of mercenaries

1609
01:41:34,013 --> 01:41:36,343
that came
to a peaceful planet.

1610
01:41:36,536 --> 01:41:39,767
They had a resource there
these men coveted,

1611
01:41:40,041 --> 01:41:41,904
so they took it.

1612
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:45,303
They kept coming back,
taking more.

1613
01:41:45,305 --> 01:41:47,935
Until finally,
the people resisted.

1614
01:41:48,216 --> 01:41:49,975
When they returned
demanding their tribute,

1615
01:41:49,977 --> 01:41:53,641
the people shouted back
in one voice, "No more!"

1616
01:41:53,931 --> 01:41:56,194
The mercenaries didn't like
the sound of that,

1617
01:41:56,328 --> 01:41:57,226
so they cut off the tongue

1618
01:41:57,228 --> 01:42:00,960
of every last man,
woman, and child.

1619
01:42:01,370 --> 01:42:03,139
Do you know what
that pack of animals became?

1620
01:42:04,823 --> 01:42:05,824
Tell them.

1621
01:42:17,418 --> 01:42:19,279
Crimson Dawn and the rest
of the five Syndicates

1622
01:42:19,281 --> 01:42:20,813
have committed
unspeakable crimes

1623
01:42:20,815 --> 01:42:22,021
across the galaxy.

1624
01:42:23,633 --> 01:42:25,223
Says you.

1625
01:42:25,287 --> 01:42:26,315
No.

1626
01:42:26,436 --> 01:42:28,308
Says them.

1627
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:30,365
Each of our worlds
has been brutalized

1628
01:42:30,367 --> 01:42:32,160
by the Syndicates.

1629
01:42:32,162 --> 01:42:33,777
Crimson Dawn
will use their profits

1630
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:34,997
from the coaxium you stole

1631
01:42:34,999 --> 01:42:37,456
to tyrannize
system after system

1632
01:42:37,531 --> 01:42:39,626
in league with the Empire.

1633
01:42:39,628 --> 01:42:41,648
And what would you
use it for?

1634
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:44,219
The same thing my mother
would have used it for

1635
01:42:44,221 --> 01:42:46,758
if she had survived
and still wore the mask.

1636
01:42:48,203 --> 01:42:49,430
To fight back.

1637
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,996
We're not marauders.

1638
01:42:53,224 --> 01:42:54,960
We're allies

1639
01:42:55,658 --> 01:42:57,461
and the war
has just begun.

1640
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:16,756
You know we can't give
the coaxium to Dryden Vos.

1641
01:43:16,867 --> 01:43:18,880
Joining the cause,
Han Solo?

1642
01:43:18,882 --> 01:43:21,277
Just trying
to make it out alive.

1643
01:43:21,446 --> 01:43:22,450
Got a plan?

1644
01:43:22,452 --> 01:43:23,947
Yeah, beginning of one.

1645
01:43:24,059 --> 01:43:24,646
Way to get our money

1646
01:43:24,648 --> 01:43:25,534
and get out from
under the thumb

1647
01:43:25,536 --> 01:43:27,829
of Crimson Dawn
at the same time.

1648
01:43:27,876 --> 01:43:30,397
Maybe get your girlfriend back
while we're at it.

1649
01:43:31,217 --> 01:43:34,008
You don't tangle
with Dryden.

1650
01:43:34,010 --> 01:43:37,340
Because unlike us,
he actually does travel

1651
01:43:37,419 --> 01:43:40,103
with hired guns,
his own private army.

1652
01:43:40,598 --> 01:43:42,160
So does Enfys.

1653
01:43:42,293 --> 01:43:44,529
Listen, here's what
I got so far.

1654
01:43:46,577 --> 01:43:48,445
What do you think
they're saying?

1655
01:43:51,969 --> 01:43:53,602
He's gonna try to help you.

1656
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:01,056
I see.

1657
01:44:02,332 --> 01:44:06,060
Lot of ways it could go south,
and only one where it doesn't.

1658
01:44:06,062 --> 01:44:08,564
That's why I need my partner.

1659
01:44:12,817 --> 01:44:14,651
Not this time.

1660
01:44:14,954 --> 01:44:16,450
I'm leaving.

1661
01:44:16,452 --> 01:44:18,581
If you're smart,
you'll come with me.

1662
01:44:18,717 --> 01:44:20,846
I thought you didn't
believe in running.

1663
01:44:20,877 --> 01:44:23,114
I prefer it to dying.

1664
01:44:50,587 --> 01:44:53,185
If by some miracle
you make it out of here,

1665
01:44:53,288 --> 01:44:54,789
find me on Tatooine.

1666
01:44:55,618 --> 01:44:57,547
What's on Tatooine?

1667
01:44:57,549 --> 01:44:58,586
Heard about a job,

1668
01:44:58,588 --> 01:45:01,418
big shot gangster
putting together a crew.

1669
01:45:01,833 --> 01:45:03,562
That'll be the one.

1670
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:04,539
The one?

1671
01:45:04,541 --> 01:45:06,738
My last score.

1672
01:45:06,882 --> 01:45:08,444
Yeah, I still got
some debts to pay

1673
01:45:08,446 --> 01:45:11,048
before I can head back
to Glee Anselm

1674
01:45:11,736 --> 01:45:13,738
and get into the valachord.

1675
01:45:47,114 --> 01:45:48,393
Welcome home.

1676
01:45:48,395 --> 01:45:50,291
He's waiting for you.

1677
01:45:50,386 --> 01:45:51,387
Thanks, Toht.

1678
01:45:53,341 --> 01:45:54,827
Weapons.

1679
01:45:54,829 --> 01:45:56,131
I didn't bring 'em.

1680
01:45:57,769 --> 01:45:59,137
They're fine.

1681
01:46:03,493 --> 01:46:05,295
We're gonna win.

1682
01:46:08,344 --> 01:46:10,642
It's not that kind
of game, Han.

1683
01:46:11,783 --> 01:46:12,988
The object isn't to win.

1684
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:15,142
It's just to stay in it
as long as you can.

1685
01:46:18,297 --> 01:46:19,765
You don't know everything.

1686
01:46:20,807 --> 01:46:22,008
No.

1687
01:46:24,305 --> 01:46:26,622
Just a bit more than you.

1688
01:46:34,749 --> 01:46:35,749
I knew it!

1689
01:46:36,532 --> 01:46:37,576
My men, they all said,

1690
01:46:37,578 --> 01:46:39,932
"There's no way
they pull this off."

1691
01:46:39,934 --> 01:46:41,616
"Qi'ra's not ready."
That's what they said,

1692
01:46:41,618 --> 01:46:43,753
but I had faith anyway.

1693
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:47,009
Where's Beckett?

1694
01:46:47,169 --> 01:46:48,472
Beckett didn't make it.

1695
01:46:52,555 --> 01:46:53,420
Tell me.

1696
01:46:53,422 --> 01:46:55,853
Job took a bad turn
on Kessel.

1697
01:46:56,246 --> 01:46:58,065
He died saving my life.

1698
01:46:58,222 --> 01:47:00,212
How are you holding up?
You all right?

1699
01:47:00,302 --> 01:47:00,970
I'm okay.

1700
01:47:00,972 --> 01:47:02,667
All right, good.

1701
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:04,670
Colo claw fish, anyone?

1702
01:47:04,672 --> 01:47:06,039
- No. Thank you.
- No?

1703
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:08,635
You know, whatever Beckett's
shortcomings may have been,

1704
01:47:08,637 --> 01:47:09,655
I always admired him.

1705
01:47:09,657 --> 01:47:11,422
He was a man of principles.

1706
01:47:11,424 --> 01:47:13,887
When he made a commitment,
he honored it

1707
01:47:13,889 --> 01:47:16,210
and I think we can
all take solace

1708
01:47:16,212 --> 01:47:18,688
in knowing how proud
he would've been

1709
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:22,263
to see you here,
following his example.

1710
01:47:22,324 --> 01:47:23,974
Han and Chewbacca
behaved admirably.

1711
01:47:23,976 --> 01:47:25,438
They'll make
reliable smugglers,

1712
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:26,768
should we ever
have the need

1713
01:47:26,770 --> 01:47:28,557
when they get
their own ship.

1714
01:47:28,559 --> 01:47:30,928
Qi'ra.
Come here.

1715
01:47:32,873 --> 01:47:34,626
We'd really appreciate
the opportunity

1716
01:47:34,628 --> 01:47:36,385
to work for you again, sir.

1717
01:47:36,387 --> 01:47:37,778
I would've been
inconsolable

1718
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:39,622
if anything had
happened to you, my dear.

1719
01:47:40,904 --> 01:47:43,033
I have no one else
in my life

1720
01:47:43,425 --> 01:47:46,027
that I trust in the way
that I trust you.

1721
01:47:49,756 --> 01:47:52,829
Well, I guess we'll just
take our payment

1722
01:47:52,831 --> 01:47:53,623
and get going.

1723
01:47:53,625 --> 01:47:54,748
I'm sure you've got
competitors to crush...

1724
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:55,916
What?

1725
01:47:55,918 --> 01:47:57,427
...and black markets
to dominate.

1726
01:47:57,429 --> 01:47:59,793
Oh. Show me what
you've brought me first.

1727
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:02,666
You want me to open it?

1728
01:48:02,668 --> 01:48:04,704
Oh, yes, Han.
I really do.

1729
01:48:31,282 --> 01:48:32,642
Bring me one.

1730
01:48:32,644 --> 01:48:35,102
I don't think
that's a good idea, Dryden.

1731
01:48:35,104 --> 01:48:37,501
It's very explosive stuff.

1732
01:48:38,052 --> 01:48:40,283
I never ask
for anything twice, Han.

1733
01:49:00,979 --> 01:49:02,447
Careful.

1734
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,354
It's magnificent.

1735
01:49:08,933 --> 01:49:10,162
How'd you do it?

1736
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,120
Wasn't easy.

1737
01:49:11,122 --> 01:49:12,114
No, I mean,
how'd you do it?

1738
01:49:12,116 --> 01:49:15,214
It looks exactly
like the real thing.

1739
01:49:15,587 --> 01:49:17,575
That's
'cause it is the real thing.

1740
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:18,272
Yes, and I'm saying

1741
01:49:18,274 --> 01:49:20,429
I would believe you.
It's that good.

1742
01:49:20,497 --> 01:49:22,261
But my associate
already told me

1743
01:49:22,263 --> 01:49:25,118
about your plan to rob me
of my money

1744
01:49:25,167 --> 01:49:27,931
and give the real coaxium
to Enfys Nest.

1745
01:49:27,933 --> 01:49:29,639
Dryden, I don't know
what you're thinking

1746
01:49:29,641 --> 01:49:31,190
or what Qi'ra
may have told you...

1747
01:49:31,192 --> 01:49:33,575
No, not Qi'ra.
Not Qi'ra.

1748
01:49:33,577 --> 01:49:34,868
Qi'ra, it turns out

1749
01:49:34,934 --> 01:49:36,554
has a weak spot for you,

1750
01:49:36,556 --> 01:49:38,385
and we'll deal
with that later.

1751
01:49:38,387 --> 01:49:42,350
No, I'm talking about
my other associate.

1752
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:44,393
Can you come in
and join us, please?

1753
01:49:56,275 --> 01:49:59,411
I am sorry, kid.

1754
01:50:02,582 --> 01:50:03,943
Why?

1755
01:50:04,282 --> 01:50:05,111
Come on.

1756
01:50:05,151 --> 01:50:07,147
Don't look at me like that.

1757
01:50:07,187 --> 01:50:08,177
You weren't paying attention.

1758
01:50:08,179 --> 01:50:10,942
I told you,
"Don't trust anybody."

1759
01:50:11,908 --> 01:50:14,080
Am I wrong about that?

1760
01:50:16,518 --> 01:50:17,665
Uh-uh-uh.

1761
01:50:18,282 --> 01:50:20,027
Back away from that.

1762
01:50:20,029 --> 01:50:21,923
Put your paws
where I can see 'em.

1763
01:50:22,062 --> 01:50:23,897
Check that lid.

1764
01:50:26,044 --> 01:50:27,406
Clever.

1765
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:29,342
It's too late.

1766
01:50:29,382 --> 01:50:31,775
Coaxium's refined,
and Enfys has it.

1767
01:50:31,777 --> 01:50:34,113
Well, we figured that.

1768
01:50:48,321 --> 01:50:50,075
Drop your weapons.

1769
01:50:53,673 --> 01:50:56,578
<i>It's over.
We got them.</i>

1770
01:50:56,736 --> 01:50:57,907
And there we have it.

1771
01:50:57,909 --> 01:50:59,845
Excellent work,
Aemon, thank you.

1772
01:50:59,847 --> 01:51:01,568
Qi'ra, help me.

1773
01:51:03,912 --> 01:51:05,248
Tell me what to do.

1774
01:51:06,317 --> 01:51:08,067
What would you do

1775
01:51:08,156 --> 01:51:12,194
if the person you most
trusted in the world

1776
01:51:12,768 --> 01:51:14,237
betrayed you?

1777
01:51:16,990 --> 01:51:18,403
I would want
to know why.

1778
01:51:20,616 --> 01:51:22,779
If it was
a moment of weakness

1779
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:23,956
or something else.

1780
01:51:24,005 --> 01:51:25,007
And then what?

1781
01:51:26,551 --> 01:51:29,581
And then,
I would ask that person

1782
01:51:29,621 --> 01:51:31,875
to prove their loyalty

1783
01:51:31,877 --> 01:51:35,614
by sacrificing
something they love.

1784
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:46,172
I tried to warn you
about her.

1785
01:51:46,438 --> 01:51:48,915
You know, you're wrong
about one thing.

1786
01:51:49,044 --> 01:51:50,306
What?

1787
01:51:50,346 --> 01:51:52,643
I was paying attention.

1788
01:51:52,683 --> 01:51:54,951
You told Chewie
people are predictable.

1789
01:51:57,489 --> 01:51:59,591
You're no exception.

1790
01:52:05,252 --> 01:52:06,381
It's empty.

1791
01:52:06,445 --> 01:52:07,888
<i>The case is empty.</i>

1792
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:10,300
Aemon, what's going on?
What's happening there?

1793
01:52:10,302 --> 01:52:11,837
Aemon?

1794
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:12,900
Talk to me.

1795
01:52:38,849 --> 01:52:41,579
I hope you didn't send
all your fancy enforcers

1796
01:52:41,581 --> 01:52:43,280
because that would leave you

1797
01:52:43,282 --> 01:52:45,736
a little shorthanded
around here.

1798
01:52:46,691 --> 01:52:48,130
So,

1799
01:52:48,132 --> 01:52:52,587
if that case is empty,
then the real coaxium...

1800
01:52:52,667 --> 01:52:54,536
Leaves here
with one of us.

1801
01:52:59,602 --> 01:53:00,980
Beckett,
what are you doing?

1802
01:53:00,982 --> 01:53:02,030
Thinking.

1803
01:53:02,082 --> 01:53:03,431
And I prefer to be
the only one

1804
01:53:03,498 --> 01:53:05,322
holding a blaster
while I'm doing it.

1805
01:53:05,370 --> 01:53:06,974
Han, grab that coaxium,

1806
01:53:06,976 --> 01:53:08,273
put it in the case.

1807
01:53:08,275 --> 01:53:10,050
Big stuff,
you're coming with me.

1808
01:53:11,758 --> 01:53:13,099
Don't do this,
Beckett.

1809
01:53:13,101 --> 01:53:14,896
- We had a deal.
- Yeah.

1810
01:53:14,898 --> 01:53:15,749
I'm sorry,

1811
01:53:15,829 --> 01:53:17,392
but I'm also an entrepreneur.

1812
01:53:17,394 --> 01:53:19,974
I mean, you of all people
understand that.

1813
01:53:20,228 --> 01:53:21,228
Come on, let's go.

1814
01:53:22,436 --> 01:53:24,093
You're making
a huge mistake.

1815
01:53:24,176 --> 01:53:25,439
Won't be my first.

1816
01:53:25,497 --> 01:53:27,068
It's gonna be your last.

1817
01:53:27,331 --> 01:53:28,500
Maybe.

1818
01:53:29,435 --> 01:53:30,841
Why you gotta be
so negative?

1819
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:44,968
Han,

1820
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:46,321
now's as good a time as any

1821
01:53:46,323 --> 01:53:48,419
to reevaluate
our relationship.

1822
01:53:48,939 --> 01:53:49,939
How so?

1823
01:53:50,613 --> 01:53:52,561
I was just thinking,

1824
01:53:52,563 --> 01:53:55,561
why don't we join forces
and go get Beckett together?

1825
01:53:55,563 --> 01:53:58,433
That is a great idea.
Let's do it. You go first.

1826
01:53:59,908 --> 01:54:01,710
Oh, Han.

1827
01:54:28,384 --> 01:54:30,746
You can't win, Han,
and even if you could,

1828
01:54:30,805 --> 01:54:32,012
you'd spend
the rest of your life

1829
01:54:32,014 --> 01:54:33,326
looking over your shoulder.

1830
01:54:34,415 --> 01:54:35,416
You know what?

1831
01:54:36,392 --> 01:54:38,349
I'm kind of getting
used to the idea.

1832
01:54:45,717 --> 01:54:47,311
I'm sorry.

1833
01:54:47,383 --> 01:54:48,792
Han, she's done things that

1834
01:54:48,794 --> 01:54:51,591
you could never understand,
but I do.

1835
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:54,269
I understand her completely.

1836
01:54:55,157 --> 01:54:57,531
Once you're a part
of Crimson Dawn,

1837
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:59,335
you can't leave.

1838
01:54:59,375 --> 01:55:01,079
It's not true.

1839
01:55:01,180 --> 01:55:02,609
I know you.

1840
01:55:02,813 --> 01:55:04,917
It's what I was taught.

1841
01:55:04,919 --> 01:55:06,808
Find your
opponent's weakness,

1842
01:55:06,919 --> 01:55:08,212
and use it,

1843
01:55:08,252 --> 01:55:10,355
and today...

1844
01:55:12,352 --> 01:55:13,691
I'm yours.

1845
01:55:39,934 --> 01:55:41,402
I had to.

1846
01:55:41,998 --> 01:55:44,060
Yeah.
No, I mean, you did...

1847
01:55:44,742 --> 01:55:46,678
You did.

1848
01:55:48,789 --> 01:55:50,945
Beckett and Chewbacca,
you have to go after them.

1849
01:55:51,005 --> 01:55:52,201
What are you gonna do?

1850
01:55:52,203 --> 01:55:54,965
Well, if we give
all the coaxium to Enfys,

1851
01:55:55,070 --> 01:55:57,741
we're gonna need something
to buy our ship with.

1852
01:56:11,503 --> 01:56:14,132
- Qi'ra...
- Go and save Chewbacca.

1853
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:17,251
He needs you and you're
gonna need him, too.

1854
01:56:23,718 --> 01:56:24,719
Smile.

1855
01:56:27,571 --> 01:56:28,853
That's the word.

1856
01:56:30,011 --> 01:56:31,165
Whenever I imagined myself

1857
01:56:31,167 --> 01:56:33,103
off with you
on some adventure...

1858
01:56:34,545 --> 01:56:36,614
Always makes me smile.

1859
01:56:44,091 --> 01:56:45,927
Go. I'm right behind you.

1860
01:57:37,802 --> 01:57:39,113
<i>Yes?</i>

1861
01:57:39,115 --> 01:57:42,512
I regret to inform you
that Dryden Vos is dead,

1862
01:57:42,766 --> 01:57:44,481
murdered by the thief
he hired

1863
01:57:44,483 --> 01:57:46,087
to steal
the coaxium shipment,

1864
01:57:46,089 --> 01:57:47,351
his friend,

1865
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:49,412
Tobias Beckett.

1866
01:57:49,745 --> 01:57:51,528
<i>Is that so?</i>

1867
01:57:52,317 --> 01:57:55,547
<i>Where is the shipment now?</i>

1868
01:57:55,924 --> 01:57:57,085
Gone.

1869
01:57:57,125 --> 01:57:58,125
Beckett took it.

1870
01:57:58,201 --> 01:58:00,838
Slaughtered the others.
I alone survived.

1871
01:58:03,622 --> 01:58:06,856
<i>One man couldn't have
done this alone.</i>

1872
01:58:07,708 --> 01:58:09,424
I wasn't there,

1873
01:58:09,426 --> 01:58:12,063
but if I had been, perhaps
I could have saved him.

1874
01:58:20,292 --> 01:58:23,723
<i>Bring the ship and
come to me on Dathomir</i>

1875
01:58:23,725 --> 01:58:25,755
<i>and you and I
will then decide</i>

1876
01:58:25,757 --> 01:58:28,551
<i>what to do about
the traitor, Beckett,</i>

1877
01:58:28,607 --> 01:58:31,043
<i>and his accomplices.</i>

1878
01:58:33,172 --> 01:58:34,308
I'm on my way.

1879
01:58:36,890 --> 01:58:38,119
<i>Qi'ra,</i>

1880
01:58:38,121 --> 01:58:39,449
<i>you and I</i>

1881
01:58:39,451 --> 01:58:42,752
<i>will be working
much more closely</i>

1882
01:58:42,861 --> 01:58:44,830
<i>from now on.</i>

1883
01:59:14,936 --> 01:59:17,065
You're relentless.
I'll give you that.

1884
01:59:18,463 --> 01:59:20,565
Came as fast
as I could, buddy.

1885
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:22,471
Dryden dead?

1886
01:59:24,481 --> 01:59:26,316
Qi'ra kill him?

1887
01:59:28,105 --> 01:59:30,668
Still don't get it,
do you, kid?

1888
01:59:30,918 --> 01:59:33,154
It was never about you.

1889
01:59:33,423 --> 01:59:34,991
She's a survivor.

1890
01:59:36,159 --> 01:59:37,715
You know what
your problem is?

1891
01:59:37,717 --> 01:59:39,785
You think
everybody's like you.

1892
01:59:40,556 --> 01:59:42,243
Not you, kid.

1893
01:59:42,245 --> 01:59:43,680
You're nothing like me.

1894
01:59:45,688 --> 01:59:47,327
I hope you're still
paying attention

1895
01:59:47,329 --> 01:59:49,406
because now I'm gonna tell
you the most important...

1896
02:00:04,577 --> 02:00:07,024
You made
the smart move, kid.

1897
02:00:07,027 --> 02:00:08,583
For once.

1898
02:00:09,991 --> 02:00:11,592
I woulda killed you.

1899
02:00:18,941 --> 02:00:23,857
I really was gonna
learn to play that valachord.

1900
02:00:23,974 --> 02:00:25,176
I know.

1901
02:02:18,377 --> 02:02:19,857
That's it.
It's all loaded.

1902
02:02:23,868 --> 02:02:25,464
Do you know
what that really is?

1903
02:02:25,527 --> 02:02:26,442
Yeah.

1904
02:02:26,444 --> 02:02:29,429
About 60 million credits
worth of refined coaxium.

1905
02:02:29,431 --> 02:02:30,742
No.

1906
02:02:30,744 --> 02:02:33,182
It's the blood that brings
life to something new.

1907
02:02:33,427 --> 02:02:35,527
Yeah, what?

1908
02:02:35,529 --> 02:02:36,565
A rebellion.

1909
02:02:37,765 --> 02:02:39,583
You could come with us,
you know.

1910
02:02:39,585 --> 02:02:41,914
We need warriors
and leaders like you.

1911
02:02:48,468 --> 02:02:50,631
Maybe someday
you'll feel different.

1912
02:02:51,022 --> 02:02:53,291
Don't hold your breath, kid.

1913
02:03:08,064 --> 02:03:09,250
Don't lose that.

1914
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:23,142
Very few people
have actually seen

1915
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:24,652
the StarCave Nebula.

1916
02:03:24,721 --> 02:03:26,021
It's breathtaking.

1917
02:03:26,046 --> 02:03:27,532
Not unlike your eyes.

1918
02:03:27,690 --> 02:03:29,762
How much do you know about
intertwined celestial bodies?

1919
02:03:29,764 --> 02:03:31,983
Because I happen to be
something of an authority.

1920
02:03:32,935 --> 02:03:34,187
By the way...

1921
02:03:40,436 --> 02:03:41,865
Han!

1922
02:03:41,983 --> 02:03:43,116
You're alive!

1923
02:03:43,118 --> 02:03:44,445
Yeah, no thanks to you.

1924
02:03:44,447 --> 02:03:46,211
I should have Chewie
rip your arms off.

1925
02:03:46,213 --> 02:03:47,742
In fact, Chewie, do it.

1926
02:03:47,744 --> 02:03:48,919
Hey, Han!
We are friends.

1927
02:03:48,921 --> 02:03:50,635
You know that.
We're friends. All right?

1928
02:03:55,835 --> 02:03:57,711
Oh, look at you.

1929
02:03:57,713 --> 02:03:59,604
Thought he was gonna
rip your arms off.

1930
02:03:59,725 --> 02:04:00,683
I knew you were kidding.

1931
02:04:00,685 --> 02:04:01,529
No, you didn't.

1932
02:04:01,531 --> 02:04:03,352
- So, where's my cut?
- Your cut?

1933
02:04:04,459 --> 02:04:06,675
No, I don't think so.
We barely made it out alive.

1934
02:04:06,677 --> 02:04:08,479
All we ended up with
was that.

1935
02:04:09,271 --> 02:04:10,900
Mmm-mmm.

1936
02:04:10,902 --> 02:04:12,425
Figure it's worth
about 10,000,

1937
02:04:12,427 --> 02:04:14,148
maybe enough
for a decent buy-in.

1938
02:04:16,269 --> 02:04:17,705
You want a rematch?

1939
02:04:19,075 --> 02:04:20,343
Why not?

1940
02:04:24,252 --> 02:04:26,215
You fold now,

1941
02:04:26,285 --> 02:04:27,160
you walk away with enough

1942
02:04:27,162 --> 02:04:29,257
to get yourself
your own little ship.

1943
02:04:29,873 --> 02:04:31,176
You call,

1944
02:04:32,272 --> 02:04:33,977
I'm gonna
clean you out again.

1945
02:04:46,505 --> 02:04:47,831
I don't know,
I'm feeling lucky.

1946
02:04:50,044 --> 02:04:52,640
Ooh.

1947
02:04:52,758 --> 02:04:55,121
You really have it bad
for the <i>Falcon,</i> don't you?

1948
02:04:55,193 --> 02:04:57,824
It's mutual, trust me.
She belongs with me.

1949
02:05:07,475 --> 02:05:09,971
You got everything
you need there, pal?

1950
02:05:19,795 --> 02:05:21,263
Not bad.

1951
02:05:21,639 --> 02:05:24,281
Not bad. You know,

1952
02:05:24,283 --> 02:05:28,127
if you'd only had
this little green sylop,

1953
02:05:28,129 --> 02:05:29,626
you would've beaten this.

1954
02:05:35,477 --> 02:05:38,446
Fair and square, baby.
Fair and square.

1955
02:05:49,143 --> 02:05:50,671
Beckett said
he heard about this

1956
02:05:50,673 --> 02:05:52,962
very big gangster
putting together a job.

1957
02:05:53,751 --> 02:05:55,919
No, I'm telling ya,

1958
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,288
it's gonna be great.

1959
02:05:57,401 --> 02:05:59,271
When have I ever
steered you wrong?
