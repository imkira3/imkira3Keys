1
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:51,360
Another quick knockout for Mason Dixon,
almost perfunctory.

2
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,488
The fans let him know how they feel.

3
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,741
Hide the women and children.
This could get ugly.

4
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:01,329
This crowd does nothing to hide
its anger over this latest debacle.

5
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,207
The fans are mad.
They don't want to take it any more.

6
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,793
They seem to be blaming Dixon,
a good fighter,

7
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:11,714
for the decline not only of the heavyweight
division guys, but of the entire sport.

8
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:17,220
They're actually pelting the undefeated
heavyweight champion with ice.

9
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,556
Maybe this angry reaction
will pressure Dixon

10
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,227
to fight someone who can fight back -
if there's somebody out there.

11
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:30,358
All of boxing is hoping for a warrior
who thrills us with his passion.

12
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,757
Time goes by too fast.

13
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:04,470
Yeah? Not fast enough.
Your kid should've been here.

14
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,722
- That's all right.
- No, it ain't.

15
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,935
- The kid gets a little busy sometimes.
- He don't get that busy.

16
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:15,481
Well, let's not talk about it here, OK?
You're coming tonight, right?

17
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,276
I'm working.
I took the tour the last three years.

18
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:23,406
- I know, but it's the anniversary.
- Fine. You got my word.

19
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,741
I appreciate it. Thank you.

20
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,035
I owe you, Paulie.

21
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:04,363
Robert, what's going on?
Where've you been? You're late.

22
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,282
I don't want to hear it.

23
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:10,327
Your job performance is nowhere near
good enough to be pulling this.

24
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:13,622
I don't give a damn who your father is.
You understand me?

25
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,083
All right. Now get outta here.

26
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,127
Thank you, sir.

27
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,131
Yo, Robert.

28
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,467
Yo.

29
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,636
- Hey, how you doin'?
- What's up, champ?

30
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:31,640
- You caught me off guard.
- I wanted to catch you before you got busy.

31
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,518
- Yeah, it gets busy up there.
- So how you doin'?

32
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,187
- Real good.
- Yeah?

33
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,648
- Yo, Rock!
- Yeah, how you doin'?

34
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:44,153
- Yeah, real good.
- You wanna go out and get some coffee?

35
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,199
- I'm kinda behind. Maybe later?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

36
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:52,203
Come by the restaurant tonight.
I can have something made special for you.

37
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,791
Tonight I can't. I got plans.
A few of the guys get together, you know?

38
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,502
- Did I do something wrong?
- What do you mean?

39
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,671
Well... I don't know exactly what I mean,

40
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,842
but I just think that when I come here
you don't feel so comfortable

41
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,262
and I certainly don't wanna do that.

42
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,599
- You... you throw a big shadow.
- A big shadow?

43
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,352
You won't get anything done
down here, Robert.

44
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,855
If you won't introduce me, then I will.
I'm William Tomilson.

45
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,566
- How you doin'?
- Your son works for me.

46
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,527
It's a good job.

47
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,655
I've told Robert about 20 times
that I wanted to meet you.

48
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:32,701
I guess you're pretty busy, which isn't a bad
thing, is it? Grab a shot, will you, please?

49
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:36,247
I may not get this chance again.
Old warhorses gotta stick together.

50
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,541
- The old horses, yeah.
- I tell you.

51
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,545
- It's a good thing it's not your left.
- This makes you very popular.

52
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,881
- One, two, three.
- Finally we get to meet.

53
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,551
I gotta go.
It was nice to meet you face to face.

54
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:53,389
- How you doin'?
- You take care of yourself. I'll see you later.

55
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:58,227
I gotta get going.
I'll change my plans for tonight.

56
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,188
That'd be great.
I'm lookin' forward to it.

57
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,232
- OK.
- OK.

58
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,444
And do not let those numbers
drive you crazy.

59
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:12,074
- Too late.
- Use an eraser and get rid of all of 'em.

60
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,495
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Rock.

61
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,581
How you doin'?

62
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,264
Here you go.

63
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,105
It'll be about ten tenths, OK?
You guys take care, OK? You got it.

64
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,444
I'll try a few of these later on.

65
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,864
- It's good for bakin'.
- How much?

66
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,908
- Paul, what's the cost?
- 58.40, sir.

67
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,535
Right. Take it out of that. I trust you.

68
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,332
- You're generous.
- Not a problem.

69
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,643
How you guys doin'?

70
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,485
How we doin', Isabel?

71
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,154
OK, except for the freebie readin' the Bible.

72
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,364
He's OK.

73
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,033
Just cos you fought him
don't mean you gotta feed him.

74
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,536
- He doesn't even look like a fighter.
- Spider Rico could hit.

75
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,373
- Listen, how's your stomach?
- It's OK.

76
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,877
If you keep rubbing that olive oil on your
stomach, your kid will be born very strong.

77
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,547
- OK, whatever you say.
- No, really.

78
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,511
- Yo, how you doin', Spider?
- God bless you, Rocky.

79
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,845
Thanks.

80
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,812
- How you guys doin'?
- Hi, Rocky.

81
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,942
Jose, can you make something special
for my kid who's comin' tonight?

82
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,528
- No problemo.
- Good.

83
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,655
I appreciate it.

84
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,326
Back and forth, back and forth.
Give and take.

85
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,663
Then I went in there like an animal
and threw him into the corner

86
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,542
and I unloaded everything I had -
hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.

87
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:31,463
But Creed, he kept busting me back
pretty good and the agony began to pile up.

88
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,967
Then I heard the best sound
I ever heard in my life...

89
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,844
- The bell.
- Right, the bell.

90
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,055
And I ain't ever been so tired
and I'm sittin' in my corner

91
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,852
and I'm trying to figure out how to survive
the last round when Mickey says:

92
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,147
"Come on. Get out there
and fight this guy hard, you bum. "

93
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,566
"You gotta be first. You gotta be first. "

94
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,194
- I said, "Yo, Mick, if I could... "
- "I would. "

95
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,156
"I would. " The end.

96
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,241
- Salud.
- Salud.

97
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,394
Another quick knockout for Mason Dixon,
almost perfunctory.

98
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,230
The fans let him know how they feel.

99
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:36,445
They're actually pelting the undefeated
heavyweight champion with ice.

100
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,619
Hello, Adrian's.

101
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,537
Yeah?

102
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,831
Tell him you can't make it?

103
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,542
Yeah, I'll give him the message.

104
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:55,547
I just kept hearing, you know, Mickey's
voice in my head over and over again.

105
00:11:55,632 --> 00:12:01,011
I just dug down and before you know it,
it was toe-to-toe and it was... Excuse me.

106
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:06,517
Your son said he can't make it.
He said he'll take a rain check. OK?

107
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:23,033
Look at these birds.
Don't these birds look like flying candy?

108
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,035
Hey, birdie, you wanna fly me home?

109
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,080
You need somebody to walk you home?

110
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:35,337
It's a cold night. We need a few laughs
in our life. What do you think?

111
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,506
Maybe? Maybe?

112
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,967
OK, let's get outta here. OK?

113
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,609
This place ain't changed much from last year.

114
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,736
We done?

115
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,947
Hey, how you doin', Mick?

116
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:10,330
- That sign's fallin' apart, Paulie.
- The whole world's fallin' apart. Look at us.

117
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't talk crazy, Paulie.

118
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:19,006
You know, I think if you live someplace
long enough, you are that place.

119
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,592
I ain't no talkin' building.

120
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,261
Come on, it's gettin' late.

121
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,139
I get a headache from this train.

122
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,912
I remember when she was standin' there

123
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:54,208
all nervous and shy with this little smile,

124
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,544
and all I wanted her to do was trust me.

125
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,925
She did.

126
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,345
- She did.
- You done?

127
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,821
- How long we stayin' here?
- Not long.

128
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:28,700
- I'm glad they tore this rink down.
- Come on.

129
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,246
You heard me.
I'm happy they tore it apart.

130
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,629
The first time I walked your sister
across this ice, we was over there.

131
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:44,299
She was nervous, but I weren't
so great on the blades either.

132
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,554
Ice is stupid.
People standing on ice are more stupid.

133
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,183
Then over there, when she was fallin'...

134
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,729
my hand grabbed her and I got her arm.

135
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,607
Through that coat I could feel it.

136
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,652
Electric.

137
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,322
You said the same thing last year, Rock.

138
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,992
- Did I?
- You better develop your brain.

139
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,161
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely.

140
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:16,039
Come on, Rock, let's go.

141
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,837
We're done. There's no place
to sit down around here.

142
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,381
- It's all right.
- It ain't all right.

143
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:28,010
It's depressing and freakin' cold!

144
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:32,681
- What's the matter with you, Paulie?
- You're livin' backwards, Rocko.

145
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,184
Change the channel from yesterday.
Yesterday wasn't so great.

146
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,854
- It was to me.
- Not to me!

147
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,693
You treated her good.
You had the good times.

148
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,322
I treated her bad.
I don't have to think about this.

149
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,867
She always loved you, Paulie.

150
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,416
Sorry, Rocko.
I can't do this no more.

151
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,449
- Can I help you?
- Nah, nah.

152
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:20,122
I used to come down this place a long time
ago. Just lookin' around. No big deal.

153
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,499
Can I get you a drink?

154
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,837
- All right, maybe just a short beer.
- OK.

155
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:42,310
Go. Yeah, go on. Get him to buy you one.
Get him to buy you one. Go.

156
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,647
He's got it.
He's spending money.

157
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,901
Listen... I don't mean
to cross the line or anything,

158
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:54,072
but I read about your wife's passin'
a few years back.

159
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,658
- Yeah, it was woman cancer.
- Yeah.

160
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,119
I always heard she was a nice person.

161
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,163
Yeah, the best.

162
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,500
- Do I know you?
- We met a long time ago.

163
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,337
- We did?
- When I was a kid you walked me home.

164
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,758
- I did?
- Told me to stop smokin' and things.

165
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:17,053
Stop smokin'?

166
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,724
Are you little Marie that used to hang out
at that Atomic Hoagie shop?

167
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,310
Yeah, that's right.

168
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,687
Yeah, now I remember.
I walked you home.

169
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,691
When you got there, you turned around
and said, "Screw you, creepo. "

170
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,194
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah, you did.

171
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,781
- You sure?
- Great insults last a long time.

172
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,365
Yo!

173
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,535
- Yo, is that you? Is that really you?
- How you doin'?

174
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,206
- I think he wants to drink alone.
- Well, then, give him his drink.

175
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:50,879
I ain't stoppin' you. What's that, your man
or something? No, I don't think so.

176
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:56,760
Anyway, me and my friends, we're down
there. You think you could buy us a round?

177
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,887
You got the money.
Just one round.

178
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,680
Hey...

179
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,060
What...? What are you doin'
pushin' my hand away like that?

180
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,938
- What's your name?
- Angie. Why do you wanna know?

181
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,566
- Angie, don't be playin' a fool for that guy.
- A fool?

182
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,237
A fool? I'm the fool?
You're the fool, not me.

183
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,573
You got it twisted. You're the fool.
I'm a person just like you.

184
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,244
You ain't no better than me.
You think you're a big shot now?

185
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,580
You ain't no better than me.
No better.

186
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,125
- Wow.
- Glad you dropped in?

187
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:32,838
I think the neighbourhood's changin' a little.

188
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,715
- What was that all about?
- I don't know. It's OK.

189
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,010
Well, if you wanna take off,
I'll tally everything up.

190
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,929
- Thanks.
- How you doin', Rock?

191
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,598
I'm good, thanks.

192
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:49,020
- You live around here?
- About eight blocks from here.

193
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,106
Eight blocks.

194
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,317
Would you need a lift?

195
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,443
All right.

196
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:59,698
- Did you ever get married?
- Yeah, sorta.

197
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,616
- Sorta?
- Well, he took off.

198
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:05,537
- Poof, just like that?
- Yeah, just like that.

199
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,623
- You sorta have any kids?
- Yeah, I got one kid.

200
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,251
Yeah, me too. Me too.

201
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,962
- Wonderful boy.
- Hey, tough guy!

202
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,756
What's the matter?
You can't buy a round?

203
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,259
Girl was bein' nice to your dumb ass.

204
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,761
Yeah, what you doin' with that pig?

205
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:25,056
- She ain't nothin' but a jealous bitch.
- Come on back!

206
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,933
Hey, don't listen to 'em.

207
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:30,145
Both of yous.
You ain't no better than me!

208
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,607
- Come over here!
- Everybody's her man.

209
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,944
- You punch-drunk, goofy bastard.
- You ain't no big shot! Look at you!

210
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:41,656
You ain't even got a car
to take that pig home.

211
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,579
You all right?

212
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,664
Yeah.

213
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:55,170
What are you doing?
Don't get out. It's all right.

214
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,841
No, little Marie, it ain't all right.

215
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,556
- Yo!
- What?

216
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:10,352
I'll tell you what.
Get inside. You get inside.

217
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,271
Hey! Leave him alone!

218
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,690
- You see that? You see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

219
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,068
- What do you say?
- I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

220
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,070
Good job.

221
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,880
That guy sends his apologies.

222
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,340
OK.

223
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,733
Martin.

224
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,528
Martin. Yo, Martin!

225
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,912
- I see you still got your key.
- Yeah, I got a key. You got time to talk?

226
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,790
I got a lot of time since your people let me go.

227
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,251
You know I had nothing to do with that.

228
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,044
Yeah?

229
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,507
- Yeah, we moved in about a year ago.
- Yeah?

230
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,427
- I mean, it's only temporary.
- Yeah, I can see that.

231
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:29,055
- I'm gonna look for an apartment.
- Apartments are nice.

232
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:33,018
- Yeah. It is what it is, you know.
- Yeah. It is what it is.

233
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:36,688
But this place used to be nice.
There's a lot of history around here.

234
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,899
Yeah, like down the street there
is the Cambria Fight Club.

235
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:43,611
They used to call that the Bucket of Blood.
I took some beatings there.

236
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:50,577
But it was nice. Good memories. I heard
these buildings are 100, 150 years old.

237
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:55,790
So, I mean, if I was 150 years old I'd be
falling apart too, so it's OK the buildings...

238
00:22:55,875 --> 00:23:00,628
- Does that light work?
- No, it's burnt out or something. Yeah.

239
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,967
Hey, listen. Thanks for the ride,
and I'm sorry about those guys.

240
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:10,388
Oh, that's OK. Some of those guys just
got their brains on backwards and stuff.

241
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,349
- What's he doin' out so late?
- Is that your kid?

242
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:16,144
Yeah. I wish he wouldn't stay out so late.

243
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,813
- Amazing.
- Yeah? What's that?

244
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:24,110
Oh, last time I seen you, you was a kid,
and now you officially got one of your own.

245
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,946
It's amazing.
You know, he sorta resembles you.

246
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,492
He's got that, you know, big Irish hair.

247
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,827
Yeah, it's the other one.

248
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,624
- Yeah?
- His father was from Jamaica.

249
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,126
Jamaica? European.

250
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:45,799
- Was you on a cruise ship or somethin'?
- No, not really.

251
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,511
- What's his name?
- Steps. Short for Stevenson.

252
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,388
Right. Makes sense.

253
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:58,394
Is he lookin' like he's mad at me,
or is it the angle I'm standin' at?

254
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,940
No, no, no. He's a good kid.
You want to meet him?

255
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:06,152
You know, it's gettin' kinda late.
I got so many things to do. It's...

256
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:12,325
Yeah, I understand. Thanks again
for the ride and everything else.

257
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,704
I'll see you.

258
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,373
You too.

259
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,377
Hey, Steps, come on, let's go.
Say good night to your friend.

260
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:26,047
What are you doin' out with no hat on?
Did you get something to eat?

261
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,551
- Did you eat your dinner?
- Yeah, I already ate.

262
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,554
You're late, you know?
I've told you...

263
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,764
Yo, little Marie.

264
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,644
Ain't you going to introduce me to your kid?
How you doin', Steps?

265
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,772
- What's up?
- Listen, I got this place, this restaurant,

266
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,525
nice little eatery not too far from here.

267
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,777
What's all this junk? A tissue...

268
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:51,573
Sometimes I feel like a kangaroo
with all the stuff in my pocket.

269
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,825
Here you go.
I got a card, there it is.

270
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:59,038
And if you ever get a chance, it'd be great
if both of yous come down there and eat.

271
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,207
It'd be great.
Free. You know?

272
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,836
Anyway, I'll leave it over there... Here.

273
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,465
I'll leave it on the steps. Steps.

274
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,847
See you later.

275
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,309
Come on, let's go.

276
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:26,983
You've known what's best for you
since you were ten and walked in here alone.

277
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,611
Got everything money can buy...

278
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,280
except what it can't.

279
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,407
It's pride.

280
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,911
Pride is what got your ass outta here.

281
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,206
Losin' it is what brung you back.

282
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:46,211
But people like you, they need to be tested.
Need a challenge.

283
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,130
That ain't gonna happen.
Ain't nothin' out there.

284
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,342
There's always somebody out there.
Always.

285
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,304
And when you find somethin'
standin' in front of you,

286
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,015
somethin' that ain't runnin', ain't backin' up,

287
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,645
and it's hittin' on you
and you're too damn tired to breathe...

288
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,773
You find that situation on you, that's good,

289
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,359
cos that's baptism under fire.

290
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,115
You get through that, you find
the only kind of respect that matters -

291
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,159
self-respect.

292
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,790
Thanks, Martin. I appreciate it.

293
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,834
Now, what can the champ do for you?

294
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:31,005
You can give me some of that money you got.

295
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:35,093
- You know I like you, Martin.
- But not that much.

296
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:44,143
- How about a picture with the kid, Rock?
- Sure.

297
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:51,359
Here, son, hold up your fist.
Makes you look more hazardous.

298
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,735
- There you go.
- Thanks.

299
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,405
Enjoy your meal.

300
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,323
- He's a nice guy.
- Rocky?

301
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:01,160
- Yeah?
- Listen. Spider just went downstairs.

302
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:06,541
- What's he doin' down there?
- I don't know. That's your friend.

303
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,213
Yo, Spider.

304
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,925
- Let me do some dishes. I feel better.
- Oh, come on. You're my guest.

305
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,594
- Let me do something.
- Keep eating. Guests do.

306
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,639
Don't make me fight you again.
Last time you got lucky.

307
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,725
Lucky? OK.

308
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,227
Jesus wants me to work.

309
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,646
- Yo, Rocky.
- Yeah?

310
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,399
You got guests.

311
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,445
Don't get too wet, OK?

312
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,530
Glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.

313
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,540
- You kept the card.
- Yeah, I kept the card.

314
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,917
- Why don't you sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

315
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:04,724
Because you know what? I walk in there,
I say good morning, I do this, I do this.

316
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:09,062
Tonight, boxing once again.
Two contrasting styles in almost every way.

317
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,482
- Hey, can you turn this up?
- Welcome to ESPN's Then Versus Now.

318
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,776
Who was the best of all time?

319
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:19,530
If two athletes from different eras could
compete, who would come out on top?

320
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:23,409
Given the same rules, using the same
equipment, who was the greatest?

321
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,411
We feed our facts into the computer.

322
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,997
They will weigh in on
who they think is supreme,

323
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,334
while fielding the comments
of our panel of sports writers.

324
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,093
Champ!

325
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,803
- Yo, champ!
- Yeah?

326
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,806
Man, come check out this trash
they talkin' about you.

327
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,934
- What you talkin' about?
- Come check this out. Hurry up.

328
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:52,939
Tonight, the former two-time heavyweight
champion from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.

329
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,941
Chuck Johnson, USA Today.

330
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:59,612
Rocky Balboa fought much tougher fights
during a much tougher era in boxing.

331
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:04,117
You look at Mason Dixon and his career,
he's been spoon-fed his opponents.

332
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:09,664
No question in my mind, not only
does Rocky win, but he wins knockout.

333
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,166
Rocky!

334
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,085
Offspring!

335
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,339
- What do you think?
- Dixon is a victim of his own dominance.

336
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,509
He's never been in real knock-down,
drag-out brawls.

337
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:26,139
He's never had to dig down to rally back.
If he tries to dig down against Balboa,

338
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:31,394
he's gonna find that he doesn't have a big
enough shovel. I clearly give it to Balboa.

339
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,857
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

340
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,400
Burt Randolph Sugar.

341
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,862
Dixon has fought cream puffs,
so we don't know what he's made of.

342
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:46,325
Both in their primes - and you gotta factor
in Dixon's speed, his slashing offence -

343
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,203
he cuts Balboa to bits, no doubt.

344
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,206
Dixon wins all the way.

345
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:56,794
Here's where our subjectivity ends.
Let's see what the computer has to say.

346
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:00,047
Dixon unloads on Balboa.
Rocky has no answer.

347
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,550
Balboa's eating dirt.

348
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,403
Now Dixon is done. He is reeling.
He is almost out on his feet.

349
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:25,573
Balboa turning up the heat,
hounds him across the ring.

350
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:29,076
He's bitten off more than he can chew
this time, believe it.

351
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,120
Oh, a murderous right hook!

352
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,247
And Dixon is out on his feet!

353
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,209
He is out cold
as he crumbles to the canvas.

354
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,253
And it is Balboa who has won the event!

355
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:45,468
Ladies and gentlemen,
Baby Rocky. Baby Rocky.

356
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:56,521
I'm glad you liked the food. If you heat that up
it's pretty good in the morning.

357
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,649
- Yeah, thanks, man.
- Nice kid.

358
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,318
I hope this music ain't givin' you a headache.

359
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,779
No, I like it. It's nice.

360
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,240
Well, good. Good.

361
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,377
Yo. You think Steps wants a job?

362
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:22,588
Make a few bucks in a weekend.
It's good makin' your own G.

363
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,132
My kid stashed a few bucks doin' that.

364
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,052
Why are you being so nice?

365
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:33,641
I don't want you to think nothing's off,
you know? My wife, she's gone, but she ain't.

366
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:38,729
- Yeah, I wasn't thinkin' that, believe me.
- No? Then what was you thinkin'?

367
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,440
That you don't owe us nothin'.
What are you doin'?

368
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,442
Be patient.

369
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:47,446
No, I don't owe you nothin',

370
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:52,076
but why you gotta owe something to get...

371
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,995
Yo! Yikes.

372
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,414
Bingo.

373
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:04,005
But why you gotta owe something
to get something, you know?

374
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,173
Really.

375
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:11,846
I think hangin' out with your kid
would be nice. What do you think?

376
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,140
I think that'd be nice.

377
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,976
Good.

378
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:20,479
That's very nice.
I'm glad you come by.

379
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,233
Nice... nice watchin' you eat.

380
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,571
Good company.

381
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,035
Yo, little Marie.
Let there be light.

382
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,173
- You like dogs?
- Dogs?

383
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:50,009
Dogs. This is, like, a dog pound.

384
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,345
It's where they keep...

385
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,680
a large variety of dogs.

386
00:32:54,723 --> 00:33:00,853
I used to come here for sightseein',
but, you know, you learn a lot talkin' to dogs.

387
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:04,482
- Really, you do.
- Yeah, man.

388
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,193
Hey, man, how about this one?

389
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:13,407
- He don't look too friendly, my friend.
- This is the one. Hey, boy, how you doin'?

390
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,411
- What about this one? Come here, boy.
- Who, him?

391
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,706
- Yeah, why not?
- Hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.

392
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,875
I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.

393
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:26,754
If you look at it closely,
the colour kinda looks like old furniture,

394
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,423
like some kinda pirate chest thing goin' on.

395
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,926
Yeah, sure, man.
Hey, how about a young one?

396
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,596
Forget him. Come over here a minute.
I want you to see something.

397
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:40,017
Now, you notice what this animal
is doin' here, lyin' in that position?

398
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:44,438
- He ain't doin' nothin'.
- He's doin' a lot. He ain't wastin' no energy.

399
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,941
Cos he's dead.

400
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,990
There's a lot of good mileage
left in that animal.

401
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:59,161
Some good food, the addition of a couple
of new friends - bingo, he's back.

402
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,665
- But what do you think's a good name?
- It's your dog. You name him.

403
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,459
Hey, no. It's a community animal.
50-50.

404
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,295
Look, I don't know much about no dogs.

405
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:12,466
Well, you know, Steps, it ain't that
complicated. You pet 'em, you feed 'em,

406
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:16,971
and nature takes its course, you know.
Don't you wanna name an animal?

407
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:21,434
I think every guy should one time
try to name an animal something.

408
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,477
I don't know. Fleabag.

409
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,815
It's catchy. You know,
it ain't original but it's pretty good.

410
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:33,487
I think you could come up with in your
young brain something better than Fleabag.

411
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,157
Punchy. How's that?

412
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,119
- Punchy?
- Yeah, Punchy.

413
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,833
- I like it, you know?
- For real?

414
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:49,086
For real. Punchy it is.
I think Punchy's easy to remember,

415
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:53,424
it's not that hard to spell, and then once
it's in your brain you never forget it.

416
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,760
- Punchy. Very good.
- All right, man.

417
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,679
Good call. All right, Punchy.

418
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,931
You ready to be bailed out, my friend?

419
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:04,101
OK. Hey.

420
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:10,191
- You know I was just joking with you, right?
- Yeah, I know. You're a very funny guy.

421
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,559
Rocky?

422
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,648
Excuse me.

423
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,238
- Rock.
- Yo, Paulie.

424
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,866
Hey, they're gonna be talking
about that fake Looney Tune fight.

425
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,786
Hey, come on.
We're about to serve today's special.

426
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,414
Italian food cooked by a bunch of Mexicans
ain't so special, Rocko.

427
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,917
Hey, yo.

428
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,504
Hey, I skipped work for this.

429
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,592
What an ugly dog.

430
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,264
It's a cute dog.

431
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,475
Hey, Rock.
I'm gonna take off, all right?

432
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,019
- That stuff back there is cool.
- You like that?

433
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,230
- Yeah, man.
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

434
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:34,692
- I'm gonna catch you later.
- All right.

435
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,240
- Who's the criminal?
- He's a nice kid.

436
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,117
He dresses like a bum.

437
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,454
Coming from a human hamper,
that's quite a compliment.

438
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:50,624
- Hide the silverware.
- That's nice.

439
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,920
Hey, Spider.

440
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:00,926
Didn't you knock out that bum once?

441
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,304
Will you give it a rest?

442
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,817
I'm gonna be late for work for this.
Give me a break, huh?

443
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,862
All right, just for a few seconds.

444
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,532
In the late '60s a simulated fight
took place between two legends,

445
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,868
Muhammad Ali and Rocky Marciano.

446
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,703
Marciano, long retired,

447
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,748
and Ali, unable to fight legitimately
for three years

448
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,334
for refusing induction
into the armed forces,

449
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:36,337
was in need of money
and agreed to the dream match

450
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,131
whose outcome would be decided
by a computer.

451
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:43,928
It's almost 35 years since Rocky Marciano
won the much-disputed computer decision

452
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,847
and guess what -
not much has changed.

453
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:52,311
- Last week, Rocky Balboa won...
- That's the cartoon fight I told you about.

454
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,021
Yeah.

455
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:58,359
A stunning knockout. And keep in mind
this is taking the human factor out of it.

456
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:01,862
- Whoa, that was beautiful.
- Rocky Balboa would be triumphant.

457
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,449
KO 13, and here's some of the fallout.

458
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:09,536
What started as a form of entertainment
has now become this rallying cry

459
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:13,248
for people who think an old-school athlete
like Balboa could be better,

460
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:17,044
so computer technology has to create
what isn't. That's irresponsible.

461
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,129
Get therapy, will you?

462
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,882
Skip, how do you think Balboa
would do against Dixon?

463
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,386
Badly. Personally, I think Balboa
was completely overrated.

464
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,471
You know he owns a restaurant.

465
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,057
What's the specialty?
Pounded chicken?

466
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,977
I would have paid to see the fight.
Next topic, NASCAR,

467
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:37,773
and the controversy that won't go away.
Let's go back to Sunday's race.

468
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,776
Hey, hey, hey. Cheer up.
Free advertisement.

469
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,237
Come on. Meat house calls.

470
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,249
Yo, Robert.

471
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:01,797
- What are you doing out so late?
- I tried callin' but nothing was pickin' up.

472
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:05,509
- Is something wrong?
- No, no, I just wanted to see you in person.

473
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:09,972
- You wanna come inside?
- I wanna get your opinion on something.

474
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:14,018
- Sure. Opinion on what?
- They say you only go around once, right?

475
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,478
- Yeah, I've heard that.
- Well...

476
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,189
I think I wanna, like, do something.

477
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,275
- Like what?
- Fight.

478
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,613
You know, nothing big.
Small stuff, like locally.

479
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,952
Don't you think you're too, you know, old?

480
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:35,664
You think you oughta stop tryin'
cos you had too many birthdays?

481
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,000
- I do not.
- People'll think you're crazy.

482
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:42,129
What's crazy about standin' toe-to-toe
saying, "I am," you know?

483
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,299
That's just the ego talkin'.

484
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,969
Look, what are you tryin' to prove
to other people, Pop?

485
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:54,016
Prove? Listen, I... I stopped thinkin'
the way other people think a long time ago.

486
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:57,478
You know, you gotta think like you think.

487
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,147
- I do.
- Do you? Good.

488
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:03,484
You gotta... you gotta face reality.

489
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,820
OK? It's... it's a different world now.

490
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,490
Only the clothes is different.

491
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,328
I really don't know what you want from me.

492
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:19,666
I just want us to get involved,
you know, like a home team.

493
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:27,132
Look, whatever it is,
whatever you're going through, it'll pass.

494
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:32,012
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- Time, it's gonna catch up to all of us.

495
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:36,600
- Especially if you're standin' still.
- Hey, come on.

496
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,855
Look, I'm gonna call you in the morning.

497
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,110
- Did you tell your kid?
- I did.

498
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,403
- He think you're nuts?
- Yeah.

499
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,490
Well, he don't believe in you?

500
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,409
Welcome to my world, buddy.

501
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,746
Rocko, nobody's givin' you no title shot.

502
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,290
I know that.
I don't want one.

503
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,918
So this isn't a mental disturbance?

504
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,420
No.

505
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:09,049
You're mad because
they took down your statue?

506
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,217
No.

507
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:15,556
- Not really, no.
- If it's about money,

508
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:22,020
just hang a sign around your neck saying,
"Punch me, $5." You'll make big money.

509
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,150
What? You haven't peaked yet?

510
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,403
- Peaked?
- Yeah, peaked.

511
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,240
I don't know. There's still
some stuff in the basement.

512
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,576
- What basement?
- In here.

513
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:40,706
- Tell me about the stuff.
- What about it?

514
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:46,170
- Tell me about the stuff inside. Is it angry?
- Angry?

515
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:50,924
- Are you mad because Adrian left you?
- She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.

516
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,926
OK. OK, OK, OK.

517
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,185
You know, some...
sometimes it's hard to breathe.

518
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:05,272
You know, I feel, like, this beast inside me.

519
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:08,066
It's OK, Rocko.
Please, it's OK.

520
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,653
Is it... OK?

521
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,746
I... I just never knew
it was supposed to be this hard.

522
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:25,209
It wasn't supposed to be like this,
Paulie, you know?

523
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:37,471
- You wanna come by and help me train?
- I got a job here.

524
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,640
I understand.

525
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:44,895
Remember you said if you stay one place
long enough you become that place?

526
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,231
Rocko, this is all I got.

527
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:50,567
I understand, Paulie. I do.

528
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:59,493
Well, if you get time and maybe come down
and see me train, I'd appreciate it.

529
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,662
Of course, Rocko.

530
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,708
Bye, Paulie.

531
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,794
Goodbye, Rocko.

532
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,507
Take care, Rocko.

533
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:23,850
This plenary session of the Pennsylvania
Athletic Commission is convened

534
00:43:23,977 --> 00:43:28,355
in order to consider
the application of Rocky Balboa

535
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:32,818
for the issuance of a discretionary
professional boxing licence

536
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,656
due to his ineligibility
to be licensed as a matter of right.

537
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:41,743
Mr Balboa, you are welcome here.
Since you're representing yourself,

538
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:45,038
we invite you to make
an opening statement if you'd like to.

539
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,833
No, I'm just curious how I did, that's all.

540
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:52,546
All right. Well, the medical advisory board
has informed us

541
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:55,590
that the tests to which
you have been subjected,

542
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:59,136
you've passed these tests with flying colours.

543
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,556
- And we congratulate you for that.
- Thanks.

544
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,601
However, this commission
in good conscience

545
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:08,895
cannot recommend you for a licence,

546
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:12,316
and we therefore deny your application.

547
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,570
- Didn't I do what you asked?
- Yes, you did.

548
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:20,032
- So I should get a licence, right?
- Not exactly.

549
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:26,538
So why'd you give me all them tests
if you was never passin' me?

550
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:29,082
We've got to stand by our decision here,

551
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:34,046
and we have to deny your request
for a licence at this time.

552
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:49,394
- Yo, don't I got some rights?
- What rights are you referring to?

553
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:53,231
- Like in that official paper they wrote.
- That's the Bill of Rights.

554
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,651
Don't it say something
about goin' after what makes you happy?

555
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:59,780
No, that's the pursuit of happiness.
What's your point?

556
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:03,116
I'm pursuing something
and nobody looks happy about it.

557
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,786
But we're just looking out for your interests.

558
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:09,706
But maybe you're lookin' out
for your interests just a little bit more.

559
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:13,460
You shouldn't ask people to come
and pay the freight on somethin',

560
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:16,505
they pay, they're still not good enough.
Is that right?

561
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:20,467
Maybe you're doin' your job,
but why you gotta stop me from doin' mine?

562
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,346
If you're willin' to go through the battling
to get to where you wanna get,

563
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,264
who's got the right to stop you?

564
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:30,060
Maybe you guys got something
you never finished, you really wanna do,

565
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:34,481
you never said to somebody - something!
You're told no after you pay your dues.

566
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:38,944
Who's got the right to tell you that? Nobody!
It's your right to listen to your gut.

567
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:45,158
It ain't nobody's right to say no after you
earned the right to do what you wanna do!

568
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:52,624
You know, the older I get, the more things
I gotta leave behind. That's life.

569
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:58,505
The only thing I'm asking you guys
to leave on the table is what's right.

570
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,690
Yo! Have you seen the paper today?

571
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,192
Front row. Front row.

572
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,194
That is so great.

573
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:24,364
- All right, all right.
- You know what? Let's go get some food.

574
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:27,701
- Come on, come on. Hey!
- Robert, come on.

575
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:33,331
The last pay-per-views were in the toilet.
You're not makin' championship money.

576
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,500
There's a bunch of nobodies out there.

577
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,503
I wanna talk to you
about an interesting opportunity.

578
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:42,507
Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa
applied for a licence and got one, yeah?

579
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,551
- Yeah. Forget about it.
- Hear me out.

580
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:48,054
You want me to fight a guy I can beat
with both hands behind my back?

581
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:51,725
Everybody knows you can beat the guy,
but that's not what it's about.

582
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:55,187
It's about money. We gotta capitalise
on that computer fight.

583
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,939
This could do a million buys.
15, 20 million to you.

584
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,193
- Forget about it.
- Then what do you wanna do?

585
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,237
- Look, man, we got guaranteed fights.
- We don't.

586
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,574
You wanna do this now, I'll do it now.
We got nothing, Mace.

587
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:11,203
All the fights you come up with
all got rejected. You know why?

588
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,415
They're all bums out there. Nobody cares
about them. There's no marquee value.

589
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:19,461
But this Balboa thing is interesting
because... Listen to me.

590
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:23,590
It's a has-been-never-gonna-be world.
Call it nostalgia if you want,

591
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:25,592
but people can relate to that stuff.

592
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,261
- This is a no-lose. It's all good.
- Good for who?

593
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:31,473
For you! Not for me, for you!
Maybe you don't understand.

594
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,268
People don't like you no more.
They're not supporting you any more.

595
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,270
Don't you understand that?

596
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:41,608
Don't look at me like I'm messin' with your
legacy. Every jock thinks they got a legacy.

597
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:44,152
A legacy is what you get
instead of getting paid.

598
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,947
- Hey, don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
- I'm not.

599
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,617
Everybody knows you could kick
this old man's ass, but you don't.

600
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:54,746
You leave him with a bit of dignity.
So they say, "Mason's got compassion. "

601
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:59,167
"He's a decent guy. " You got a whole new
audience who'll double your money.

602
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:03,505
- Want a new image? That's how you get it.
- To replace the one that you two made?

603
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:06,299
Wait. We made your world green.
You made the rest.

604
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:10,262
- You made all this junk happen.
- I've had it up to here with this mess, man.

605
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:14,724
- I'm goin' back to Martin's gym.
- All right, we'll talk about this crap.

606
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,352
I want Martin back.
There's nothing to talk about.

607
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,990
- How you doin'?
- What a surprise.

608
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:34,661
I was drivin' around the neighbourhood.
I thought, "Why not drive by and say hello?"

609
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:37,497
- Do you wanna come inside?
- The dog needs exercise.

610
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,541
- Do you want to take a walk?
- Yeah.

611
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,168
- It's nice outside.
- All right.

612
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:44,838
- Nice and brisk.
- When did you get a dog?

613
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,465
We picked up Punchy a couple of days back.

614
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,302
Punchy. You named a dog Punchy?

615
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:54,639
- Actually, your kid come up with the name.
- Yeah? I think that's disrespectful.

616
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,933
No, no, it's fine, really, no.

617
00:48:57,018 --> 00:49:00,103
It's easy to remember,
and it's all that, you know.

618
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,356
What do you think about
comin' over to the restaurant?

619
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:07,235
- What for?
- Well, you know, for, like... for work.

620
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,030
The hostess is gonna be having a kid.
You'd do good.

621
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,824
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you, you'd do good.

622
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:16,202
I appreciate what you're doin' for my kid,
but I can't.

623
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:20,749
Hey, listen. I think you'd like it a lot.
It's a nice environment. It's very pleasant.

624
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:23,043
Can we drop it?

625
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,880
What's botherin' you?

626
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:31,635
- Nothin'. It's all right. I gotta get back.
- No, it ain't all right.

627
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,553
- Oh, come on.
- What?

628
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,889
I'm the first person people see?

629
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,643
Yeah. You just give out menus,
say hello, sit people down.

630
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:42,729
Look, little Marie, if I can do it,
anybody can do it.

631
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:46,232
You could find ten better people,
100 better people for this job.

632
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:50,236
- Give it a try. Like, two weeks.
- I don't wanna try.

633
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,572
- Who put this stuff in your head?
- Nobody.

634
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:56,201
Well, it just don't get in there by itself.

635
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,372
Thanks for comin' by.

636
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:06,711
Yo. When was the last time you went dancin'?
Has it been a while?

637
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:10,090
- Why are you askin'?
- Cos you're dancin' around these problems,

638
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:15,387
you might as well dance with me. I ain't that
good, but I'm better than the average bear.

639
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:19,474
- And where that came from, I don't know.
- You're crazy.

640
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,437
A little bit. But the way you're thinkin',
the way you're talkin', it's a little crazy too.

641
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:28,233
Come on. You deserve better.
Really. Come on over.

642
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:32,779
I need you to class my place up.
Philly needs you.

643
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:36,533
And if you say, "Screw you, creepo," again
I totally understand,

644
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:41,204
but I warn you, I'm gonna put myself, like,
geographically in the middle of the street

645
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:44,416
and stand here, me and Punchy,
wave to the first bus and say:

646
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:48,962
"Come over here and mash me, cos Marie
turned down the job at the restaurant. "

647
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:51,548
- "She thinks she's better than us. "
- Oh, yeah?

648
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:54,676
Well, there hasn't been
a bus down here in 20 years.

649
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,803
- Yeah?
- No.

650
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,515
That was a close call.

651
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,144
Listen, seriously.

652
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,980
Come on over. It'll be nice.

653
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,276
All right.

654
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,837
Paulie!

655
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,842
Sorry, Paulie.

656
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,012
Sorry.

657
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:13,087
How are you?
Get my unusual up there.

658
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:16,174
Excuse me.
Deliveries are in the back.

659
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:20,011
- I'm not a delivery guy.
- Well, do you have a reservation?

660
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:22,931
Do I look like a freakin' Indian?

661
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,894
Hey, Rock. Rocky?

662
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:35,735
I think we got a little bit of a problem
with this guy.

663
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,905
A problem?
No, no, he's just a relative.

664
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,657
OK.

665
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,702
Yo, Paulie.

666
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,873
- What happened to your eye?
- I hit it.

667
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,084
- Why?
- Needed to.

668
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,629
- What happened?
- I'm celebratin', Rock.

669
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,048
- Why?
- I retired.

670
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,592
Retired?

671
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,719
Yeah?

672
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:09,894
So when'd they start giving retired people
meat instead of watches, Paulie?

673
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,440
I don't need a watch.

674
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:17,777
I got a watch!

675
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,780
- You gave me a watch!
- Paulie...

676
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,783
I don't need a goddamn watch.

677
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,787
- Yo, Paulie.
- I got a watch!

678
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,624
I got two watches!

679
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,127
Yo, Paulie!

680
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,100
Yo, Paulie.

681
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,810
Rock.

682
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:57,233
It takes guts to climb back in that ring
knowin' you're gonna take a beating.

683
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:03,489
- You're gonna do all right, Rocko.
- How do you know that?

684
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:06,367
The stuff in the basement.

685
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,005
Thanks, Paulie.

686
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:25,637
OK?

687
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,099
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah. Good. How are you?

688
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:34,771
- Oh, yeah, fine. This is great.
- Some guys over there wanna talk to you.

689
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,856
- OK.
- OK?

690
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,696
- Thanks for comin' by.
- No problem. Our pleasure.

691
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,532
- You wanna hear some stories?
- What kind?

692
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:50,536
- A lot of people like to hear fight stories.
- Maybe later.

693
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:55,041
I'm Lou DiBella. This is LC Luco.
He's Mason Dixon's manager.

694
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:58,044
- Will you sit down and join us?
- Sure.

695
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:03,883
We have the promotional contract for
Mason Dixon - who's a big fan, by the way.

696
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:07,053
When he heard you were interested
in fighting, he thought,

697
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:13,226
why not try and work something out? Like
a special event, a first-class exhibition fight.

698
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,895
- Why me?
- He respects the hell outta you.

699
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:20,900
And that computer fight got people curious.
This could be very interesting.

700
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:24,362
But I ain't interested in getting
mangled and embarrassed.

701
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,698
No, that's not gonna happen. Never.

702
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:33,246
Truthfully, I was thinkin'
more on a, like, minuscule small level.

703
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,207
You know, small fights.
Not big fights. Small fights.

704
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,419
Things that... Local.
You know what I mean? Not...

705
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:41,754
Not a bad idea.
But don't think of it as big.

706
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:45,258
Think of it like an exhibition,
as a glorified sparring session.

707
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,470
And here's something you'll like -
we'll donate a portion of the gate to charity.

708
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:53,599
- Well, that's always nice.
- It's good to give.

709
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:55,810
- Where is it taking place?
- Las Vegas.

710
00:55:55,894 --> 00:56:00,189
Las Vegas. Nice and warm.
This cold's gotta be killin' you.

711
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:01,274
A little stiff.

712
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,860
- You move better when you're warmer.
- Yeah.

713
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:07,613
And if nothing else,
you'll have new stories to tell.

714
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:10,616
- I really gotta think about this.
- Absolutely.

715
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,952
- Is that OK?
- I understand. No problem.

716
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:16,664
- I'm gonna go. You can order something.
- What do you recommend?

717
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,958
It's all edible.

718
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,712
OK. Thanks.

719
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:27,800
We got him. Imagine if Dixon
met this bastard in his prime.

720
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,635
- He'd kill him.
- No kiddin'.

721
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,972
Man, I'm confused.

722
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:45,276
- I didn't think this would come along.
- But this is what you wanted, right?

723
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:49,155
You know, I talk and I talk and sometimes
I think what I'm saying is true,

724
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,618
and then, you know, I look at myself
and I'm not even sure what is true any more

725
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:58,498
cos it's like I push this crazy idea about
fightin'... I mean, what's it all about?

726
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,626
Do I care about standin' toe-to-toe
and all that stuff?

727
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:05,379
Or like my kid says, is it just, like, ego?

728
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:09,342
Or am I this old pug who's just tryin'
to replace old pain with new pain?

729
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:12,053
I don't know. I-I don't know.

730
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:16,682
Look, I know I usually don't say a lot.

731
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:20,895
I'm always listenin' and lookin' and...

732
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:25,191
But, you know, who you are, you know,
the part of you that's so full of life,

733
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:28,236
I mean, we all have that feeling, that fire,

734
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:32,865
but we usually never get a chance to use it
and then it just goes away.

735
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:36,702
But you can.
You've got this opportunity, so do it.

736
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:42,333
Why not? I mean, this is who you are,
you know? This is who you'll always be.

737
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:45,920
And you don't move aside for nobody
until you're ready to move.

738
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,881
And it doesn't matter
how this looks to other people.

739
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,718
All that matters is how it looks to you.

740
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,888
Rocky.

741
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:58,933
Rocky, look at me.

742
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,812
How it looks to you.

743
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:08,067
And if this is something that you wanna do
and if this is something that you gotta do,

744
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:10,486
then you do it.

745
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,739
Fighters fight.

746
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,453
You're not gonna punch me, are you?

747
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:27,920
All right, listen. I gotta go before I wear out
my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.

748
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,173
Thanks.

749
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:41,976
Fighters fight, right?

750
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:52,486
It's rare when you get to promote an event
that's bigger than boxing. This is.

751
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:56,574
Skill versus will,
with part of the proceeds going to charity.

752
00:58:56,617 --> 00:59:00,912
The brainchild of Mason Dixon,
to honour past heavyweight champions.

753
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:05,374
Warriors like Rocky Balboa.
Let's open it up for questions.

754
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:09,837
A few great fighters have fought
in their 50s with disastrous results.

755
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:14,342
Why risk the danger and embarrassment?
The smart money says you have no chance.

756
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:19,764
A puncher always has a chance.
This fight will be competitive.

757
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,974
Why are you doing this, Rocky?

758
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:26,312
I don't know.
I'd rather do something I love badly than...

759
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:31,817
Than... than to feel bad
by not doin' something you love.

760
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,487
The press has labelled you
a Balboasaurus.

761
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,990
How do you feel about that?

762
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:42,328
Mason, say the following happens.
You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.

763
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:45,873
You lose, say a thumb in the eye,
you'll be the joke of the decade.

764
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,209
You all know that'd never happen.

765
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:54,674
This is only an exhibition. Don't go tryin'
to make more of this than that computer tried.

766
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:58,386
Isn't this sport in enough trouble
without circus events?

767
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,346
Next question.

768
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:04,642
This looks like a cheap bit
of ring theatre between a has-been

769
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:08,020
and a man whose own credible legacy
and popularity is in doubt.

770
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,898
- What's the upside?
- Doubt? Upside?

771
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,901
I mean... What do you mean, upside?

772
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,362
I mean, what do I have to do?

773
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:21,200
I'm 33 and 0, with 30 knockouts.
I'm doin' you people a favour.

774
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:25,204
I'm havin' this exhibition for you,
and you gonna make a mockery out of me?

775
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:29,000
I'm the champ. I mean,
I get pissed, this guy get hurt.

776
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,627
See you at the fight.

777
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:39,510
The guy's a joke.
He's gonna get crushed.

778
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,686
Oh, look who's here.

779
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:52,857
- How you doin'? Have you seen my father?
- He's in the back.

780
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,359
We've never served this many meals.

781
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:59,530
And you're doin' good?
You're enjoyin' everything, right?

782
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:03,576
Excuse me.

783
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,912
How you doin'?

784
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,874
- Glad you come by.
- Can I talk with you?

785
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,710
- Sure.
- Can we do it outside?

786
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,551
- You're going through with this?
- I start training tomorrow.

787
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,846
Hey, Rock.
I made some connections.

788
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,433
I can make some money on this.
Endorsements.

789
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,602
- Absolutely. Do that.
- Thank you.

790
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,104
- Sure.
- OK.

791
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:35,608
- So you nervous about the fight?
- Yeah, scared to death.

792
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:38,569
- You don't look scared.
- Well, I ain't supposed to.

793
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:41,113
Then you don't have to do it.

794
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,407
Yeah, well, I think I do.

795
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:49,872
You know, living with you,
it hasn't been easy.

796
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,625
People see me but they think of you.

797
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:55,586
With this going on,
it's gonna be worse than ever.

798
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,671
- It don't have to be.
- Sure it does.

799
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,591
- Why? You got a lot goin' on, kid.
- What, my last name?

800
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:05,054
That's the reason I got a decent job,
why people deal with me in the first place.

801
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:10,976
Now I start to get a little ahead, to get a little
something for myself, and this happens.

802
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:14,939
Now, I'm asking you as a favour
not to go through with this, OK?

803
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,817
This is only gonna end up
bad for you and bad for me.

804
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,694
- You think I'm hurtin' you?
- Yeah. In a way you are.

805
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:24,698
- It's the last thing I ever wanted to do.
- I know that's not what you wanna do,

806
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:28,327
but that's just the way that it is.
Don't you care what people think?

807
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:32,998
Doesn't it bother you that people make you
out to be a joke and I'll be included in that?

808
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,084
Do you think that's right?

809
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,253
Do you?

810
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,760
You ain't gonna believe this,

811
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:47,263
but you used to fit right here.

812
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,598
I'd hold you up and say to your mother:

813
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,351
"This kid's gonna be
the best kid in the world. "

814
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:55,813
"This kid's gonna be somebody
better than anybody ever knew. "

815
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:58,774
And you grew up good and wonderful.

816
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:02,194
It was great just watching.
Every day was like a privilege.

817
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:06,365
Then the time come for you to be your own
man and take on the world, and you did.

818
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:11,495
But somewhere along the line,
you changed. You stopped bein' you.

819
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:15,082
You let people stick a finger in your face
and tell you you're no good,

820
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,878
and when things got hard, you started
lookin' for somethin' to blame.

821
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,921
Like a big shadow.

822
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:27,386
I'll tell you something you already know.
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.

823
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:31,390
It's a very mean and nasty place.
And I don't care how tough you are,

824
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:35,603
it will beat you to your knees
and keep you there permanently if you let it.

825
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,857
You, me, or nobody
is gonna hit as hard as life.

826
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,026
But it ain't about how hard you hit.

827
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:45,738
It's about how hard you can get hit
and keep movin' forward.

828
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:49,074
How much you can take
and keep movin' forward.

829
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:51,911
That's how winnin' is done!

830
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:54,830
If you know what you're worth,
get what you're worth,

831
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:58,334
but you gotta be willin' to take the hits
and not pointin' fingers,

832
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:02,588
sayin' you ain't where you wanna be
because of him or her or anybody!

833
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,840
Cowards do that, and that ain't you!

834
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:06,967
You're better than that!

835
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,977
I'm always gonna love you no matter what,

836
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,271
no matter what happens.

837
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:22,441
You're my son and you're my blood.

838
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:25,152
You're the best thing in my life.

839
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:32,451
But until you start believin' in yourself,
you ain't gonna have a life.

840
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,957
Don't forget to visit your mother.

841
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,134
- Yeah, those are beautiful.
- Yeah.

842
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:35,180
- You get off early from work?
- No.

843
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,475
I left. I quit.

844
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:42,605
Quit? Why?

845
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:45,566
I wasn't very...

846
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:50,779
I don't know. I just...
I didn't... I didn't fit in there.

847
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,324
I understand.

848
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:00,164
- So what are you gonna do?
- Right now?

849
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:05,085
Right now I'd rather be with you.

850
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,881
That all right?

851
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,800
Yeah.

852
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:16,221
It's been a long time since I've seen a fight.

853
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:32,237
You know all about fightin' so there's
no sense us goin' down that road again.

854
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,074
To beat this guy, you need speed.

855
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:38,202
You don't have it.

856
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,955
And your knees can't take the poundin',
so hard runnin' is out.

857
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:44,083
And you got arthritis in your neck,

858
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:47,836
and you've got calcium deposits
on most of your joints,

859
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,255
so sparrin' is out.

860
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,466
I had that problem.

861
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:57,763
So what we'll be callin' on
is good old-fashioned blunt-force trauma.

862
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:02,768
Horsepower. Heavy-duty, cast-iron,
pile-drivin' punches

863
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:06,438
that will have to hurt so much
they'll rattle his ancestors.

864
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:12,653
Every time you hit him with a shot, it's gotta
feel like he tried kissin' the express train.

865
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:16,615
Yeah! Let's start buildin'
some hurtin' bombs.

866
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:53,152
- You'll get it. You'll get it.
- You can do it, Rocko.

867
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,855
Gettin' stronger!

868
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,582
Come on, Rocko!

869
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,258
Come on, come on.
There you go.

870
01:08:58,384 --> 01:08:59,885
There you go.

871
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:06,725
You can do it, Rocko.

872
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,938
Gettin' stronger!

873
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:12,648
Three.

874
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,399
Four. Five.

875
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,601
Yeah!

876
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:02,781
Rocky Balboa, 217.

877
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:07,411
The undisputed heavyweight champion
Mason Dixon,

878
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:10,414
221.

879
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:17,713
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.

880
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:34,396
- You know how much money is in this?
- A lot.

881
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,816
Imagine tryin' to clean this place.
No, seriously.

882
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,943
Balboa.

883
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:44,907
You guys, I'll catch up with you all later, OK?

884
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,451
Robert, I want you to hang with me.

885
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:51,830
- How you doin', champ?
- I'm good.

886
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:55,417
There's no reason
for neither one of us to get hurt.

887
01:10:55,460 --> 01:11:00,631
I'll do my best to carry you, make sure
you save face. There'd be no embarrassment.

888
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:03,717
But I promise you, if you try to press me,

889
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:10,182
you hit me, you hurt me, you hit me low,
cheap-shot me, I'll get you outta there.

890
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:14,394
You know, a lot of people
come to Vegas to lose. I didn't.

891
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,981
- It's already over.
- Ain't nothin' over till it's over.

892
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:22,444
- What's that from? The '80s?
- That's probably the '70s.

893
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:28,200
Just remember what I said.

894
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,327
Hey, yo, champ.

895
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,038
Yo, ain't you a little scared?

896
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,998
I don't get scared.

897
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:44,341
I think you try a little harder when you're
scared. This is what has worked for me.

898
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:47,386
- I ain't scared.
- You ain't scared of me?

899
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:51,556
Come on, let's see what you got.
Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.

900
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,074
- Hey.
- Hi.

901
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,868
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- No. You wanna come in?

902
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,412
No. It's OK.

903
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:18,709
I just wanted to - I don't know - come by
and wish you good luck for tomorrow.

904
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:22,629
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Um... I brought you something.

905
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:27,300
I hope you don't mind.
I took it from the restaurant.

906
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,261
Adrian.

907
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:31,972
Yeah. I thought she would
keep you safe, you know.

908
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:36,768
- Yeah, she always brought me luck.
- Yeah.

909
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:43,066
Yeah. Listen, I wanted to say thanks
for everything you've done for me and my kid.

910
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:44,943
You've been great.

911
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,533
You know, tomorrow...

912
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:58,790
you're gonna prove that the last thing
to age in somebody is their heart.

913
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,084
- I'll try.
- You go show 'em.

914
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,211
Thank you.

915
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:27,861
The heavyweight championship
has been one of sport's most coveted titles

916
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:29,821
for 120 years.

917
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:33,784
Two-time heavyweight champion
Rocky Balboa, the Philadelphia slugger,

918
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:39,206
renowned for his cast-iron jaw,
ferocious body attack and will of steel,

919
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:42,626
which have carried the smaller fighter
to numerous victories

920
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,504
against physically superior opponents.

921
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:48,507
And Mason Dixon,
the current heavyweight title holder,

922
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:51,802
with all the speed and determination
any fighter could want.

923
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:56,014
But many still question whether
he has the heart of a true champion,

924
01:13:56,099 --> 01:14:00,685
never having been pushed to go the distance.
Tonight, we find out.

925
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:04,147
We're at the Mandalay Bay Events Center
in Las Vegas, Nevada,

926
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:08,235
for the much-anticipated showdown
between Mason "The Line" Dixon

927
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:11,738
and Rocky "The Italian Stallion" Balboa.

928
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:14,658
I'm Jim Lampley, with Larry Merchant
and Max Kellerman,

929
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:16,993
live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel, Las Vegas,

930
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:21,623
where we anticipate one of the most
compelling events in boxing history -

931
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:25,377
the current unappreciated
heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon,

932
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:27,379
putting his reputation on the line

933
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:31,508
against legendary ex-ex-ex-champion,
Rocky Balboa.

934
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:34,886
Even though most see this
as a glorified sparring session,

935
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:37,013
the energy in the room is electric.

936
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,266
Why is this billed as an exhibition?

937
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:43,311
A wild guess - so they wouldn't
have to call it an execution.

938
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:51,069
Zechariah 4:6 says, "It is not by strength,
not by might, but by his Spirit. "

939
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:56,825
We have already claimed the victory
in our Lord Jesus Christ.

940
01:14:56,909 --> 01:15:01,079
- Good luck, Rocky.
- Thanks, Spider. I appreciate it.

941
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:16,553
Nobody's expecting much, I think,
from the way-past-his-prime former champ

942
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:17,762
Rocky Balboa.

943
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:21,516
Rock, I gotta talk to you.

944
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:28,940
Look. Look, I know you got a lot of stuff
you gotta get out of your system, huh?

945
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,276
Tonight you do it. Right?

946
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:33,695
Get rid of the damn beast.

947
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:36,615
Let it be done once and for all.

948
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:39,242
Please, I love you.

949
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:53,632
There go the lights. The buzz is building
toward a roaring crescendo.

950
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:10,607
Where'd that come from?

951
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:13,652
I chose it. I love Sinatra.

952
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:16,404
He's very good, Sinatra.

953
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,698
- Let's go.
- Very good.

954
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:26,248
And here comes Rocky Balboa,
a veteran of the wars,

955
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:29,084
here for one more last hurrah.

956
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:32,212
Or the Last Supper,
with him as the main course.

957
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:35,006
What's that music?
You can't be serious.

958
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:38,009
"High Hopes"?
Talk about wishful thinking.

959
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:42,222
Maybe "no hopes" is more realistic.
Anyway, the crowd likes it.

960
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:45,684
Look at the Italian Stallion!
Cool and relaxed.

961
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:49,521
Rocky's an off-the-board underdog
and they don't care at all.

962
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:53,692
This is about his pride
and dignity and his punch, guys.

963
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,361
The last thing to go is a guy's punch.

964
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:59,864
Rocky always has that puncher's chance.

965
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:08,248
Rocky Balboa is still,
as you can hear, the people's champion.

966
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:12,752
Prediction - for two rounds,
Dixon's gonna have his hands full.

967
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:17,924
Two whole rounds?
We have a cockeyed optimist in the house.

968
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:21,553
- How you doin'?
- The crowd wants to see something real.

969
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:26,433
Jim, Rocky Balboa just asked me how
I'm doing. Now, I grew up watching this guy.

970
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:29,227
I never thought I'd be calling one of his fights.

971
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,938
This is unbelievable.
I'm a fan. I can't help it.

972
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:34,858
Now here comes Mason Dixon.

973
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,644
Dixon establishing
his presence in the ring,

974
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:15,440
and suddenly now a conversation
breaking out at the ringside.

975
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:18,276
Mike Tyson calling out
Mason "The Line" Dixon.

976
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:23,782
- You can't call the shots. I'm the champ.
- You're not doin' nothin'. This is charity!

977
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:28,787
And you got that...
you got that midget with you right there.

978
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,208
Ladies and gentlemen,

979
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,127
welcome to the Mandalay Bay Resort

980
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:39,130
and Casino of Las Vegas,

981
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:42,801
and a special main event of the evening,

982
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:46,137
ten rounds of heavyweight excitement

983
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,932
sanctioned by
the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

984
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:54,479
And when the bell rings, the referee
in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.

985
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:57,816
And now, for the thousands in attendance

986
01:18:57,942 --> 01:19:01,694
and the millions watching around the world,

987
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:03,863
ladies and gentlemen,

988
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:09,494
let's get ready to rumble!

989
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:16,584
Introducing first, fighting out of
the blue corner, wearing black with gold,

990
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:19,963
official weight 217lb.

991
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:22,882
His professional record: 57 victories,

992
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:27,929
including 54 knockouts,
with 23 defeats and one draw.

993
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:31,349
He is the fighting pride of Philadelphia,

994
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:35,895
the two-time heavyweight
champion of the world,

995
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,189
"The Italian Stallion"

996
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:43,194
Rocky

997
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,405
Balboa!

998
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:51,035
I hope he gets his head busted.

999
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:54,038
Shut up.

1000
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:01,212
Across the ring, fighting out of the red corner,
wearing white with blue,

1001
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:03,715
official weight 221 Ib.

1002
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:06,050
He has a perfect professional record,

1003
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:12,265
consisting of 33 bouts, 33 victories,
including 30 knockouts.

1004
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:17,604
Originally from Tampa, Florida,
but now fighting out of Las Vegas, Nevada,

1005
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:22,108
the reigning, undisputed, undefeated

1006
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:25,236
heavyweight champion of the world

1007
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:33,161
Mason "The Line" Dixon!

1008
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,917
All right, gentlemen.

1009
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:42,420
All right, Mason, Rocky. We went over
the rules in the dressing room.

1010
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,088
I expect a good, clean fight.

1011
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:48,593
Watch the kidney punches, rabbit punches,
those low blows. Be careful with those.

1012
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,597
Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.
Remember, I'm fair but I'm firm.

1013
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:54,599
- Touch 'em up.
- Enjoy the ride.

1014
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:57,727
The champ is not in the best shape
we've seen him in.

1015
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:00,104
Maybe he just plans to phone this one in.

1016
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,607
- That wouldn't be a surprise.
- Love you.

1017
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,485
One thing about Rocky
we know for sure,

1018
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:08,112
this guy's showing up in shape.

1019
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:11,282
- The old man's crazy.
- He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.

1020
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:14,619
You just take it easy.
This is an exhibition. Do it to him.

1021
01:21:14,662 --> 01:21:16,246
Three rounds to set a pace.

1022
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,623
- Every time you hit him, make a dent.
- Got it.

1023
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:23,545
The moments before a Rocky Balboa fight?
I can't believe it's here.

1024
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:29,968
Round one begins. If old George Foreman
shocked the world with one punch

1025
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,220
why can't old Rocky Balboa?

1026
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,931
As much excitement
as there is in the arena,

1027
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:37,267
there's a sense of foreboding as well.

1028
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:45,233
And now Mason "The Line" Dixon
goes to work with his jab,

1029
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:49,279
as though he's fighting the number one
challenger in the heavyweight division.

1030
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:51,656
This is to be expected early on.

1031
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:57,954
You knew the champ was gonna control the
distance with his jab, his height, his range.

1032
01:21:57,997 --> 01:22:01,249
Balboa, looking to get in a shot,
misses wildly!

1033
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,626
Did you like that?

1034
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:07,005
It looks like a speed bag
against a punching bag.

1035
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:11,050
Rocky's frustrated - he came
out of retirement to get into a fight.

1036
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:15,805
Guys named Rocky don't like to be toyed
with. One punch could turn it around.

1037
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:19,392
Apparently he forgot
his arthritis meds this morning.

1038
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:21,227
Rocky misses!

1039
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:25,023
There's a meat-seeking missile
on the point of the chin by the champ.

1040
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,900
More pinpoint jabs by Dixon.

1041
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:31,195
There's a hard right hand,
a left and a right by Balboa.

1042
01:22:31,322 --> 01:22:34,741
He drives Dixon into the ropes
with a series of shots.

1043
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:37,201
And the crowd goes berserk.

1044
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:47,211
Dixon punishing Balboa
for the temerity of landing those shots.

1045
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:55,219
It's toe-to-toe in the corner,
Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.

1046
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:05,730
Balboa landing potent combinations to the
champion's head. A wake-up call for Dixon.

1047
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,273
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1048
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,983
- Sit down.
- Bricks in his glove.

1049
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:11,736
- What happened to the angry stuff?
- It's still there.

1050
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:14,572
Yeah, well, he came to battle, OK?
Listen to me.

1051
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:17,784
If there's any bone in your body
he can break, he'll do it.

1052
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,577
Give the man a little respect.

1053
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:22,622
Compubox numbers
tell the grisly story here.

1054
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:26,042
Balboa landed nine of 13 punches
in that round.

1055
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:31,214
Dixon landed an incredible 59 out of 69.

1056
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:32,423
Listen to me.

1057
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:35,051
Rocky's been here
a million times before -

1058
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:39,430
coming out to start another round
after he took a beating in the previous one.

1059
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:41,599
I warned him. I warned him.

1060
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:47,522
Well, he's tired.
His legs are going fast or already gone.

1061
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:52,360
And what's truly extraordinary
is that Rocky can still take it!

1062
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:56,948
The boxing commission, which, remember,
was criticised for licensing him,

1063
01:23:57,032 --> 01:24:01,452
would be massacred
if something happened to Rocky.

1064
01:24:05,124 --> 01:24:07,125
A monstrous straight left hand!

1065
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:10,461
Down goes Rocky,
and that could be the end of the fight.

1066
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:14,382
That could be the exhibition right there.
But no, Balboa up,

1067
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:18,845
as referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants
to continue and Rocky says yes.

1068
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:21,889
Even Balboa can be too brave
for his own good.

1069
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:25,935
Dixon comes right back to try to finish it.
Balboa almost went down.

1070
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:27,979
Rocky shoves Dixon back.

1071
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:30,481
As Dixon lands these brutal shots.

1072
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:31,816
Cover up!

1073
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:36,279
Open shots at close range,
right and left hands, and down goes Balboa,

1074
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:39,449
perhaps for the last time
in his fighting career.

1075
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:43,035
- That should do it.
- Three! Four! Five!

1076
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:44,495
Six! Seven!

1077
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:47,665
- Get up! Get up!
- Eight!

1078
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:51,002
Nine!
How do you feel? You OK?

1079
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:55,965
Now Rocky, furious with himself,
convinces Cortez he wants to keep fighting.

1080
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:59,927
Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it,
Rocky saying he's fine.

1081
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:02,972
- He wants to go on.
- Let it go! Let it go!

1082
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:06,350
And Balboa comes back
with a left and a right,

1083
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:10,521
and bulls Dixon into the ropes
for the second round in a row.

1084
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:15,610
Back comes Dixon with brutal left-hand shots.
Dixon hurt his hand!

1085
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:18,404
- Go after him!
- This is Rocky's chance.

1086
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,032
The champ just hurt his hand on Rocky's hip.

1087
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:24,744
Balboa immediately going to work
to the body. Huge right hook.

1088
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,705
Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body.

1089
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:30,208
These are big punches.

1090
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:35,004
Yes!

1091
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:41,886
Rocky Balboa has knocked
the reigning heavyweight champion down!

1092
01:25:41,929 --> 01:25:43,262
You hurt him!

1093
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:48,518
Mason Dixon has never taken
this kind of punishment in his entire career.

1094
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,688
Maybe he's clearing his head,
but the body shots really caved in his ribs.

1095
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:55,733
Balboa is thinking knockout himself!

1096
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:59,153
Another counter hook by Balboa.
Followed by two more!

1097
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:02,240
Dixon fires back his own hooks.
Rocky's stunned.

1098
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:04,617
It's an all-out war along the ropes,

1099
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:10,331
as round two comes to a close
amid a giant tumult in the ring.

1100
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,083
Incredible.

1101
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,085
Yeah, all right!

1102
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,921
Welcome to Rockyland.

1103
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:22,927
- How's the hand?
- My hand's broken.

1104
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:26,639
If we lose, it's your ass. Your ass!

1105
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:29,559
It'll numb up on you.
It'll numb up in three rounds.

1106
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:32,937
Once that hand numbs up,
Dixon's gonna be able to throw it hard.

1107
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:37,275
- Until then, here's Rocky's chance.
- Take it to him! No reverse!

1108
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:39,151
Take the pain, champ.

1109
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:43,114
Everybody thought this was a joke,
including me. Now nobody's laughing!

1110
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,616
You go get him! Go out strong!

1111
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,631
Keep him off you.

1112
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:05,303
That's it! That's it!

1113
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:21,652
You won that round.
Break him down.

1114
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,659
Bomb him! Bomb him!

1115
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:37,001
Yeah!

1116
01:27:39,338 --> 01:27:42,089
Just keep throwin' them bombs.

1117
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:54,518
Come on.

1118
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:04,195
You can do this.

1119
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,365
Rocky! Rocky!

1120
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,376
Get him! Go!

1121
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,269
Go through him.
Run over him.

1122
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:35,161
Unload on him!

1123
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,456
Dig down, Mason!

1124
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:53,387
- They're leaving nothing on the table.
- The fans are standing.

1125
01:29:53,472 --> 01:29:55,848
They may not be able to sit down for a week.

1126
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:58,851
- You're doin' great.
- I'm doin' better than I thought.

1127
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:02,813
- Are you sure he's OK?
- I've had worse.

1128
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:06,776
Toe-to-toe, one round to go.
Who would have believed this was possible?

1129
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:09,779
- Can you see outta that eye?
- Let me talk. Look at me.

1130
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:14,909
Don't take any more chances out there than
you have to. There's nothing more to prove.

1131
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:18,871
- I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.
- You can do it, Rocko!

1132
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:21,457
- One more round, we go home.
- OK, then do it.

1133
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:27,254
There's a saying that every great champion
has one great fight left in him,

1134
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:30,591
and Rocky is proving it so far.

1135
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:35,721
- Come on. Touch 'em up.
- The last round of your life! The last round!

1136
01:30:35,806 --> 01:30:38,849
Come on. Touch 'em up.
Let's go. Touch 'em up.

1137
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:42,311
- You're one crazy old man.
- You'll get there.

1138
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:43,354
Let's go.

1139
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:48,484
Tenth round of a scheduled ten.
Who would have dreamed that Rocky Balboa

1140
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:53,489
would still be in this "exhibition" against
the heavyweight champion of the world?

1141
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:54,907
You can do it! Come on!

1142
01:30:54,991 --> 01:31:00,287
This fight is as though Dixon
got on-the-job training in courage.

1143
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:03,290
- Cover up!
- They're both in a pain-free zone.

1144
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:06,210
These guys are fighting
in another dimension now.

1145
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:11,048
Beyond belief! Balboa just walking
straight into Dixon's punches.

1146
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:14,051
Target practice for Dixon.

1147
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:20,683
They're exchanging right hooks.
Here comes Dixon!

1148
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:24,061
He's exhausted from punching the man.

1149
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:26,730
Knock this bum out, Mace!

1150
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:42,913
What is it you said to the kid?
It ain't about how hard you hit.

1151
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:47,293
It's about how hard you can get hit
and keep movin' forward.

1152
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:51,046
How much you can take
and keep movin' forward.

1153
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:55,092
- Get up.
- Let's go! Get up!

1154
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:58,053
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

1155
01:31:58,096 --> 01:31:59,096
Get up.

1156
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:04,602
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

1157
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:25,497
Another monster body shot.
Rocky's ancestors must have felt that one.

1158
01:32:25,624 --> 01:32:29,126
- Start movin' those hands!
- Less than two minutes to go.

1159
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:31,670
The crowd is astonished that Balboa got up.

1160
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,673
- Come on! Come on!
- Turn it over! All the way through!

1161
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:37,301
.. and retaliates with fury!

1162
01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:42,139
Chop him down!

1163
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:46,477
Come on, Rocky! Come on!

1164
01:32:48,772 --> 01:32:50,481
Take him out now!

1165
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:53,817
They're trading shots again.

1166
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:58,280
Balboa's trying to hit
anything and anywhere!

1167
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:01,116
Win it! Win it!

1168
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:10,459
Yes!

1169
01:33:20,387 --> 01:33:23,347
- You're a great champion. You got heart.
- Thanks.

1170
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:27,184
Thanks for the opportunity.
Good man.

1171
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:33,357
That was unbelievable.
That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.

1172
01:33:33,483 --> 01:33:36,318
That's the kind of pride
you're talking about.

1173
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:40,030
Hey, Paulie.

1174
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:42,866
The beast is gone now.
The beast is out.

1175
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:46,787
One of the most overused words in sports,
guys, is "incredible".

1176
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:51,333
I hate to say it, this is incredible.

1177
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:54,336
Let's go!

1178
01:33:57,132 --> 01:34:00,801
Ladies and gentlemen,
before we go to the score cards,

1179
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:06,724
a round of applause
for these two heavyweight warriors.

1180
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:15,190
We have a split decision.

1181
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:24,074
Adelaide Byrd scores it 95-94 Dixon.

1182
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:31,874
Chuck Giampa has it 95-94 Balboa.

1183
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:45,095
And Bill Graham scores it 95-94

1184
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:47,765
for the winner by split decision,

1185
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:50,351
and still undefeated,

1186
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:53,354
