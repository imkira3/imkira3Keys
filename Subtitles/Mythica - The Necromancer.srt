1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,574
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:41,198
Which one?

3
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:45,015
That one. Follow me, hurry.

4
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:48,085
Go!

5
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:50,979
I think he went over here. This way.
Right behind you.

6
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:57,419
Faster. Get him!

7
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,324
Out of the way!

8
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,595
Halt!

9
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:42,365
Did you see him?

10
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,303
I see him.

11
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,607
Come on.

12
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:55,669
We have to follow him.

13
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:13,408
There he is. There he is.
Come on.

14
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:04,906
Marek.

15
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:09,034
Your mind must be as sharp and focused,
as the point of that arrow.

16
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:12,325
Whenever distracted by fear and desire,
it pierces all things.

17
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,977
Turned inward, it pierces you.
Pierces me?

18
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,898
What does that even mean?

19
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,749
Focus.

20
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:25,396
Focus!

21
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:30,148
How can I focus when you're teaching
in proverbs and talking in circles?

22
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:31,456
You're holding back.

23
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:37,881
You have faced certain death, before
and defeated it with your wit and courage.

24
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:42,253
The next time you drain
the life of someone,

25
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,166
it will be hard for you
to recover yourself.

26
00:03:47,523 --> 00:03:48,858
Three years ago,

27
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:52,691
I had a team.
We called ourselves the redthornes.

28
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,946
And we were good.

29
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:58,832
The best there was.
Good enough to gain the favor of the gods.

30
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,878
And? And...

31
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,058
We were rich.

32
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,843
And powerful.
The envy of the realm.

33
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,320
You were a hero.

34
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:09,877
What happened?

35
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:13,220
We stopped szorlok
from reuniting the darkspore.

36
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,232
And sacrificed a dear friend.

37
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,081
There was no other way.

38
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:22,864
The others never forgave me,
so that was the end

39
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,718
of the red thornes.

40
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:30,011
Heroes do, what others can't.

41
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,670
Not because they want to,
not for themselves or their friends.

42
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,230
They choose the unwanted path,
the darkest roads.

43
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:40,622
Can you do that?

44
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:45,273
Yes, I think so.

45
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:49,254
Good.

46
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:05,526
For you.

47
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:09,520
Thank you.

48
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,386
don't thank me.

49
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:17,384
Tomorrow you'll be cursing the day
you ever met, gojun pye.

50
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:22,410
Now...

51
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:24,124
Focus!

52
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,501
Possession... sensations...

53
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:56,138
Friends, even enemies. You must cut
all attachments and be free of them.

54
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,727
Clear?

55
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:07,511
When you said, you weren't gonna hold back,
i didn't think you meant it so literally.

56
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,530
The more I make you fight me here,

57
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:12,530
the less energy you'll have
to fight me... here.

58
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:34,934
What is it?

59
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:37,487
What is it?

60
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:48,444
It's a feeling.

61
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,689
It's gone, now.

62
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,439
We've done enough for today.

63
00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:00,643
I'll be here before sunrise,
we'll start again.

64
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,158
Before sunrise!

65
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:33,432
Gentlemen, some music, please.

66
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,177
Hammerhead!

67
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:12,569
Another round of drinks
for the huis!

68
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,576
From the redthornes!

69
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,828
Thank you, rethornes!
We're the rethornes!

70
00:08:19,864 --> 00:08:21,992
We're the rethornes? Yes.

71
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:24,884
I like it.
No, no, no. Red is not really my color.

72
00:08:25,232 --> 00:08:28,228
Two against one, dagen.
We're the rethornes.

73
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,916
We're the rethornes!

74
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,445
Teela?

75
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:39,685
Teela!

76
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:48,766
Teela.

77
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:52,756
What kept you?

78
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,800
This and that.

79
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:56,905
I am glad to see you, thane.

80
00:08:57,548 --> 00:08:59,058
Glad to see me?

81
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,931
What about...

82
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,338
The face you most longed to see,

83
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,822
is mine?

84
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,438
Heavens, I am famished.

85
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:12,793
I must get something to eat.

86
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:30,572
Yes.

87
00:09:32,203 --> 00:09:33,766
Yes!

88
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:38,622
No. No, no, no.
don't think so, keep dancing.

89
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:40,482
I have to go.
Nee, one more dance.

90
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:41,564
Nee.

91
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:43,976
I told gojun pye I'd see him tonight.

92
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:49,111
You promised that grey old hermit,
that you would rather see him,

93
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:51,208
than stay with this?

94
00:09:53,213 --> 00:09:54,554
Come now, dagen.

95
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:56,176
I'm sure there's some

96
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:59,714
old mistress of yours
that you can seduce

97
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,740
into giving you a discount.

98
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:06,178
Discount, just got married.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

99
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,126
Horseshit aside.

100
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:11,025
Let? S go someplace, huh?
Let get out of here.

101
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:14,711
You and me. Let? S take a walk.
Just the two of us.

102
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:21,288
I... no, I have... I have to go.

103
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,842
The red thornes!

104
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:34,886
Another pint.

105
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,431
You must be out of your senses
if you don't quit.

106
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:39,006
Lest say, I'll do that.

107
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:44,928
I should go.

108
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:47,497
I have prayers to make at nightfall.

109
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:51,113
For goddess prayers?
Is there no end to your piety?

110
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,170
Surely, the goddess needs a night off
from your prayers as desperately as I do?

111
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:57,511
Please, take your hands of me.

112
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:05,782
What did you think was going to happen?

113
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:10,637
She's unobtainable.
You can look but don't touch.

114
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,390
Let's quit it.
No I will not quit it, it's pathetic.

115
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:20,419
Quite frankly, you're ruining
our victory smell.

116
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:22,830
It smells limp.

117
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:25,625
And unmanly.
It smells like sagged balls.

118
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:32,022
Alright. I'm done.

119
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,944
I see you back at the cave.

120
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,221
Goddess of light,
hear my prayer.

121
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,003
I'm at a crossroad.

122
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:57,798
It's only me.

123
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,603
I haven? T finished my prayers.

124
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:03,488
This won't take long.

125
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:06,545
I just wanted to tell you,

126
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:09,780
I was a good soldier. What?

127
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:15,160
I never fell asleep on a nightwatch.
I spoiled field rations, without complaint.

128
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:17,716
Up every morning,
before the cock crowed.

129
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:20,574
I know what it means,
to make an oath.

130
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:24,434
I know what it means,
to break one.

131
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:29,372
Thane... I just wanna tell you,

132
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:32,347
I respect your vow.

133
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:37,551
You won? T have to push me away, anymore.

134
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:40,006
From now on, I'm your brotheratarms.

135
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:42,979
Nothing more.

136
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:51,567
Right.

137
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:54,748
That's about the reaction I expected.

138
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:56,793
Good night.

139
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,716
Thane!

140
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,689
Good timing. Let's close the portal,
before more of them come through.

141
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:29,087
Close the portal.

142
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:32,087
How do I close it?
By handson magic!

143
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:35,396
What do I use for inversion?
Anything!

144
00:15:15,102 --> 00:15:16,352
Not good.

145
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,833
In about three seconds,
I'm gonna faint due to loss of blood.

146
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:48,652
I can't fight them all alone.

147
00:15:48,654 --> 00:15:52,386
No... you'll have to buy me ten seconds,
give or take.

148
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,808
Wow.

149
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:26,779
You have to teach me that one.
Oh, yeah, sure.

150
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:30,777
As soon as I find enough cursed
black prolog. But right now,

151
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,169
really...

152
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:36,359
We need to... cauterize...
My wound, before...

153
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:40,357
Sorry.

154
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:08,127
Gods.

155
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:12,423
I'm not sure you had to burn
my hole side up.

156
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:13,999
Sorry, I panicked.

157
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:17,079
Just be glad you fainted,
before I started the burning.

158
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,188
I'm not complaining.
And now I'm here, aren't I?

159
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:27,346
Where exactly am I?

160
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,637
We're near my teams hideout.

161
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:31,274
What happened up there?

162
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:35,364
The portal. Those... creatures?

163
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:37,466
Last night, I was...

164
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:39,835
Struck with a vision...

165
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:42,183
Of szorlok,

166
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:45,364
stepping off a boat onto dry land.

167
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:48,422
So, last night I went to see for myself.

168
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:50,008
It was a trap and I...

169
00:17:50,055 --> 00:17:52,053
I walked right into it.

170
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:54,588
Hundreds of his minions
where waiting for me.

171
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:55,988
So, I...

172
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:58,296
Had to use the portal as a...

173
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:01,922
Last resort to escape,
but they followed me here.

174
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,800
Well... you know the rest of the story.

175
00:18:05,313 --> 00:18:06,777
Szorlok has...

176
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:09,725
Two pieces of the darkspore, now.

177
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:13,001
So, he has begun to work
on reanimating the dead.

178
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:15,423
If he unites all four pieces,

179
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:19,201
his undead legions will spring
right out every other hollow grave and...

180
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,053
He would be unstoppable.

181
00:18:23,424 --> 00:18:26,787
You never told me the whole story,
how you stopped szorlok in the first place.

182
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,678
It was twentyone years ago,

183
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,224
szorlok was digging deep
into the hidden magic? S.

184
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:35,357
At the time the invaders
were at our doorstep.

185
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:41,412
Toxicated with his new source of power, he
sought to expand it further with the darkspore.

186
00:18:41,591 --> 00:18:44,729
Uniting it, he would become
the lich king.

187
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,143
Master over...

188
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:47,704
Death itself.

189
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,936
Fortunately, I turned against him,
before he finished the deed.

190
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:54,626
Szorlok! We stopped szorlok.

191
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:57,165
No!
Eventhough it caused our king in the war.

192
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:02,819
What now?

193
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:06,859
Szorlok will need the last two pieces
of the darkspore.

194
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:11,117
And then he will would necromancers.
He needs you.

195
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:13,713
Well, he can't have me.

196
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:15,313
That's right.

197
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:18,764
And you are gonna do
whatever I tell you, now.

198
00:19:18,787 --> 00:19:19,988
Agreed?

199
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:23,716
You stay here and do nothing.

200
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:24,847
What?

201
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,193
Do nothing. And you stay here.
Well, you can't just expect me to...

202
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:29,213
Thanks.

203
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:34,168
Szorlok is looking for you,
but he must not find you.

204
00:19:34,203 --> 00:19:36,040
Not until, you're ready to face him.

205
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:38,908
To risk meeting him now,
is to risk the faith of the world.

206
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:40,825
Do you understand that?

207
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:43,906
So, you want me to just hide?
Yes.

208
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:53,779
Where're you going?

209
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:53,865
You stay in your hideout
and when I return,

210
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:56,239
and if, you are still here,

211
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:59,096
I will teach you any spell you want.

212
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:00,643
Agreed?

213
00:20:05,294 --> 00:20:06,644
Stay here.

214
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:44,971
Anasett.

215
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:47,231
Goddess of the light.

216
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:48,839
Hear my prayer.

217
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,130
Anasett.

218
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:55,217
Goddess of light,
hear my prayer, please.

219
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:56,470
Teela.

220
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:58,754
What happened?
Goddess of light, please hear my prayer.

221
00:21:58,755 --> 00:22:00,080
Teela, what happened?

222
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,700
Teela, calm down.
Can't handle this.

223
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:07,547
Teela, what happened?

224
00:22:09,736 --> 00:22:11,387
The den has thane.

225
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:18,404
Come on.

226
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:37,184
They can't just take him in,
can they? Maybe,

227
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:39,935
we can go to the magistrate...
No, no, no, no.

228
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:50,622
Now, thane is a condemned man.
Convicted before he freed him.

229
00:22:50,623 --> 00:22:53,651
The battalions will free him from the den,
only to carry out his execution.

230
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:55,288
It's all my fault.

231
00:22:55,646 --> 00:22:58,701
It was me peregus was after.
We should go to the guild.

232
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:01,587
Plead with peregus.
Let's use all the money we have left.

233
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,738
Maybe we can pay for his release.

234
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:07,213
I can't go.

235
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:10,351
I shouldn't have even come this far.

236
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,286
I'm sorry.

237
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:13,757
What?

238
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:19,717
Look, thane and I may have our rivalries, and
gods knows I wished him dead once or twice,

239
00:23:20,117 --> 00:23:21,879
but peregus...

240
00:23:22,238 --> 00:23:27,834
Peregus malister is a notorious vicious tormentor
and thane will suffer excruciatingly, every minute,

241
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:31,747
until he is freed or dead.
This is all the money I have.

242
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:33,040
Take it.

243
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,491
Thane needs you, marek.

244
00:23:38,963 --> 00:23:42,493
He would gladly take your place,
were the situations reversed.

245
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:44,675
Is that what you want?

246
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,271
For me to take his place?

247
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,787
If that is what it comes to,
I'll gladly do it, you know it.

248
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:55,087
I can't. It's all my fault.

249
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:58,091
Nonsense, how can it be your fault?

250
00:23:59,948 --> 00:24:01,055
Dagen,

251
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:03,777
you're more familiar with the guild
than either of us.

252
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:07,871
Is this is enough to free thane?

253
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,312
Perhaps.

254
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:14,511
I mean, I...
Maybe, I don't know.

255
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:17,191
It might at least buy some time.

256
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,377
You should come with us, marek.

257
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:25,491
It will only infuriate malister more. Yeah,
maybe, but I just think, you should come.

258
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:27,569
If for nothing e...

259
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:31,828
If for nothing else,
than to say goodbye to him.

260
00:24:32,932 --> 00:24:35,188
Hurry now, before it's too late.

261
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:53,951
It's not very often,
a man of my position,

262
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:57,648
gets to hold the life
of a vitalian in his hands.

263
00:24:57,942 --> 00:25:00,799
This is a very special occasion for me.

264
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:04,984
And as a taewang,
I'd like you to know that, thane.

265
00:25:06,694 --> 00:25:09,646
It warms my heart
to know you're a patriot, malister.

266
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:11,080
Surely.

267
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:18,384
I'll get my amuzement from your companions.

268
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:24,044
And when you're body is displayed
and hung from the city walls,

269
00:25:24,498 --> 00:25:27,055
they will know how serious I am.

270
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:32,280
I do have a reputation to uphold.

271
00:25:32,651 --> 00:25:35,688
You didn't seem to lose any advice
with those high placed friends over me.

272
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,751
Yeah.

273
00:25:39,713 --> 00:25:41,989
Aye, we can make a deal, malister.

274
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,906
I can work it off for ya.

275
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:48,767
You keep him alive as long as you can.

276
00:25:56,979 --> 00:25:58,136
Stop!

277
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,257
You harm another one of my men
and I'll kill thane.

278
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,119
Kill thane and there will be no one left
to protect you from us.

279
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,623
I suppose you've come here
to save his life.

280
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:10,639
Not see the both of us die.

281
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:16,300
We brought money, but your men outside
wouldn't let us in.

282
00:26:16,902 --> 00:26:18,876
Just say the word, teela.

283
00:26:19,126 --> 00:26:22,649
I've got this maggot.
Clean shot.

284
00:26:23,937 --> 00:26:26,763
Go ahead, kill me.

285
00:26:26,915 --> 00:26:29,476
And I will drop this rope.

286
00:26:29,477 --> 00:26:32,548
And I will crush his skull.
Dagen, no!

287
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:40,476
Good!

288
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:44,484
Now we all know our options.

289
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,961
Betylla... peregus...

290
00:26:49,082 --> 00:26:51,664
These mercenaries,

291
00:26:51,665 --> 00:26:54,626
they are gonna solve
our supply chain woes.

292
00:26:55,598 --> 00:26:57,190
The eel.

293
00:26:57,486 --> 00:26:59,384
Yes...

294
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:02,022
The eel.

295
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,086
What say you, marek?

296
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:07,515
My dear,

297
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:11,819
shall we strike another bargain?
You all fight, don't listen to him.

298
00:27:12,191 --> 00:27:13,533
Kill this man.

299
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,364
And rip out his beating hart
and hand it to him.

300
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:19,143
Pay is pay.

301
00:27:19,924 --> 00:27:21,244
What's the job?

302
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,882
We are owed a large shipment
of illustrium, north of the border.

303
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:30,548
All you have to do
is bring that shipment to me.

304
00:27:31,094 --> 00:27:36,059
And I will forget all the offenses
thane has shown me.

305
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:37,701
But...

306
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,841
If you fail,

307
00:27:41,135 --> 00:27:43,367
he's just gonna have to die.

308
00:27:43,937 --> 00:27:47,241
Why don't we just pay you
what we brought and call it good?

309
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:52,396
Do you have 20.000 gold
in that little purse of yours?

310
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,264
Huh?

311
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,830
Because that is what one shipment
of illustrium is worth.

312
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:03,465
And that's far less
than my reputation is worth.

313
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:08,413
A reputation that was soiled
when that fyke put a knife to my throat

314
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:12,471
and forced me to release
the freedom of that bitch!

315
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:15,048
That bitch, I rightfully owned!

316
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,732
Yes!

317
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:22,251
Yes, this is the cost
of your freedom, slave girl.

318
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:24,565
This is what you brought.

319
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:30,105
North of the border is a large area to search
for one man. I'll need thane for the job.

320
00:28:31,268 --> 00:28:33,281
That's just impossible.

321
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:36,552
Betylla will accompany you on your journey.

322
00:28:37,434 --> 00:28:41,748
So long as I receive correspondence
on your progress,

323
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,158
I still my hand,

324
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:46,709
on this vitalion pig.

325
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:53,069
Are we agreed?

326
00:28:54,238 --> 00:28:56,328
Is that agreed? Agreed.

327
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:58,745
We leave at dawn.

328
00:29:00,897 --> 00:29:04,668
Teela. Teela, stop.
No regrets, teela.

329
00:29:05,283 --> 00:29:07,728
Stop. Listen to me.

330
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:11,337
As long as peregus malister is send
one of these each sundown,

331
00:30:11,371 --> 00:30:13,888
your friend will live
to see another day.

332
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,565
We are traveling 25 leagues
on the north road to the war front,

333
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:21,407
to find captain James purio.

334
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:25,789
Malister... thinks you got what it takes.

335
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:28,290
Malister is a foul creature.

336
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:32,166
And if he touches thane,
i will personally slit his throat.

337
00:30:35,244 --> 00:30:36,310
Hey.

338
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:42,878
For the ehh...

339
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:47,998
You comrade lives
to suffer another day.

340
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,543
Where do you keep those critters?

341
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:08,203
It wasn't easy for you
to come with us, and...

342
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:10,664
I was wrong to accuse you.

343
00:32:10,665 --> 00:32:14,082
You see, I was not myself when I said...
Forget it.

344
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:17,276
I owe more to thane,
than anyone else.

345
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:22,280
You're not wearing your necklace.

346
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:25,800
I uhm, no longer wear the image
of anasett.

347
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:29,398
Well, you weren't able to heal thane,
but does that go for the rest of us?

348
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:31,716
Maybe, your goddess
only withdrew her blessing from thane.

349
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:34,071
No, it's different.

350
00:32:34,107 --> 00:32:36,072
The heavens are closed to me.

351
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:39,626
She may bless your path.

352
00:32:39,782 --> 00:32:42,360
No. No, I can't... I... I don't want to...
Please...

353
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:45,220
I cannot bear to carry it
so silent and cold.

354
00:32:45,221 --> 00:32:46,913
Please, take it.

355
00:32:49,164 --> 00:32:50,245
Fine.

356
00:32:50,522 --> 00:32:54,263
But you'll need to earn back her favor.
And we need our healer.

357
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,925
Thane made his choice.
You made yours.

358
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:02,241
It's done.

359
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:06,838
I'm sure that your goddess has nothing to
gain from you wallowing in guilt, now.

360
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:10,152
You choose love.

361
00:33:10,643 --> 00:33:13,327
And now you're here
working to safe thane for love.

362
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:19,434
That's brave and noble and...
Any decent goddess would know that.

363
00:33:19,738 --> 00:33:23,645
Love. It's strange to hear you speak
so highly of it.

364
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:26,318
Do I seem so unfeeling?

365
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,405
You never take dagen's affection
for you seriously.

366
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:54,738
I have business with captain purio.

367
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,718
Captain purio is a little busy today,
fighting gutchers.

368
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:04,008
War business past this point only.

369
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:07,167
The captain will want to see me,
i assure you.

370
00:35:10,017 --> 00:35:12,830
You can pass, but only you. No!

371
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:15,095
I'm going with you.

372
00:35:16,185 --> 00:35:18,906
Fine. Just you.

373
00:35:43,187 --> 00:35:44,604
Kill them!

374
00:35:44,961 --> 00:35:46,127
Forwards!

375
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:50,243
Where is captain purio?
He was on the front lines, last I heard.

376
00:35:52,406 --> 00:35:53,711
Wait!

377
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:54,917
You can't be serious.

378
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:57,865
If he dies up there, before we get to him,
our league will be over.

379
00:35:57,899 --> 00:36:01,225
And so will the mission,
along with the life of your friend.

380
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:06,493
Move out!

381
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:43,011
Water...

382
00:36:43,207 --> 00:36:46,348
So thirsty...
Where is captain purio?

383
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,957
Help, please...

384
00:36:49,894 --> 00:36:51,357
Hold it, you bastard!

385
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:54,147
Where?

386
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:56,425
The field hospital.

387
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:01,263
What bring you to the...
Bows of hell?

388
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:03,584
Is it a friendly visit?

389
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:07,914
The eel.

390
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:10,352
Where is he?

391
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:14,441
Wow, now...
The eel is my friend.

392
00:38:14,787 --> 00:38:17,731
Trade secret, his whereabouts.

393
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:20,760
Checks and balances, you know?

394
00:38:21,403 --> 00:38:23,821
If I give you the eel, now...

395
00:38:24,098 --> 00:38:27,281
It cuts me out
of the supply chain, you see?

396
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:35,209
Please, captain.
No, no. Let him kill me.

397
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:38,300
I'll die of the plague maraud, anyhow,

398
00:38:38,301 --> 00:38:41,580
if the medics don't kill me first.

399
00:38:41,582 --> 00:38:43,301
I need to find the eel.

400
00:38:43,564 --> 00:38:46,524
He's the key,
to saving a dear friend.

401
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:52,859
Why is a sweet thing like you,
working with a slug like betylla?

402
00:38:52,894 --> 00:38:54,450
Please...

403
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:59,013
The truth is,
I've not heard from the eel...

404
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:03,588
In a moon, at least.

405
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:05,421
No, but,

406
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:08,352
you might know where he is.

407
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:11,149
Come closer.

408
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,158
The eel is in love
with a whore named yuliya.

409
00:39:16,193 --> 00:39:21,709
She's at the rose traveling brothel,
camped just outside of ungkirk,

410
00:39:21,711 --> 00:39:24,175
South of the illustrium mine.

411
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:27,357
If the eel is hiding from the world,

412
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,959
that's where he'll be.

413
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,180
Thank you.

414
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:22,200
No.

415
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:26,435
We're leaving.
You bastard, what have you done!

416
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,984
No witnesses.

417
00:40:31,064 --> 00:40:32,202
I'll kill you!

418
00:40:38,345 --> 00:40:39,930
Get off me.

419
00:40:42,377 --> 00:40:45,138
Get... off... me...

420
00:40:46,765 --> 00:40:49,749
Your friend... will die.

421
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,868
You will obey me,

422
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:09,446
or not another messenger will be released.
You're a vile man.

423
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:13,303
How do you live with yourself?
I can ask you the same...

424
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:15,466
Necromancer.

425
00:41:48,213 --> 00:41:49,497
Did you find him? Yes.

426
00:41:49,597 --> 00:41:52,598
What happened?
We know where the eel is, let? S go.

427
00:42:31,033 --> 00:42:32,595
Dire wolves.

428
00:42:34,495 --> 00:42:38,662
Maybe half a league away, at most.
We need to build a fire, and soon.

429
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,693
And if a swallow or an owl make pray of it,
what then?

430
00:42:53,024 --> 00:42:55,582
My beetles are pray to nothing.

431
00:43:56,283 --> 00:43:58,102
What is that you give them?

432
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:01,926
Only the nuri cement they need.

433
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:03,993
How long have you had them
with you?

434
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:07,200
None of them are older
then 2 years,

435
00:44:07,202 --> 00:44:09,990
but I've kept their lineage,
since I was a boy.

436
00:44:10,562 --> 00:44:14,356
Would you like to hold him?
No, I... I couldn't, I...

437
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:15,928
They're clean.

438
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:20,374
They are a friend to the farmer
and then huntsman.

439
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:23,580
They are the ideal organism.

440
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:29,203
What is it you whisper to them,
when you send them back to the den?

441
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,452
One word...

442
00:44:34,486 --> 00:44:36,252
Home.

443
00:45:01,874 --> 00:45:03,472
I'll take the watch.

444
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:06,133
I can't sleep, anyway.

445
00:45:07,136 --> 00:45:08,164
Yeah...

446
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:11,010
Me neither.

447
00:45:19,332 --> 00:45:20,734
How's the, eh...

448
00:45:21,571 --> 00:45:23,930
Training with gojun pye going?

449
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:28,064
He wants me to be something that I'm not.
What, deity?

450
00:45:28,457 --> 00:45:29,883
Elegant, even?

451
00:45:31,077 --> 00:45:33,522
Gentle, perhaps?

452
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:36,551
It's not funny.
It was a bit funny.

453
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,693
He wants me to,

454
00:45:38,894 --> 00:45:41,144
dedicate myself completely.

455
00:45:41,952 --> 00:45:44,160
Because that would make you more
like, what?

456
00:45:45,734 --> 00:45:46,988
Teela?

457
00:45:49,388 --> 00:45:50,546
I don't know.

458
00:45:51,383 --> 00:45:52,946
Like him...

459
00:45:53,022 --> 00:45:55,827
Like a... hero, I guess?

460
00:45:56,738 --> 00:45:57,877
Marek, you...

461
00:46:01,095 --> 00:46:03,676
You're not at all
like any of the other girls.

462
00:46:05,173 --> 00:46:06,383
You know, you're...

463
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:08,598
You're one of a kind.

464
00:46:11,176 --> 00:46:12,673
I don't wanna be different.

465
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,194
There's great power in you.

466
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:21,854
And I don't mean your magic.

467
00:46:23,685 --> 00:46:26,104
You know what you want
and you go after it.

468
00:46:26,548 --> 00:46:28,419
Without hesitation.

469
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,432
Ascent.

470
00:46:36,281 --> 00:46:38,044
I don't always know what I want.

471
00:47:12,647 --> 00:47:13,825
I can't.

472
00:47:15,426 --> 00:47:17,635
You can't...
I want to, but I... I can't.

473
00:47:56,593 --> 00:47:58,164
Good morning, darling.

474
00:47:58,756 --> 00:48:00,124
How did you sleep?

475
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:04,352
I know...

476
00:48:05,484 --> 00:48:08,111
I'd like to say,
nothing happened last night.

477
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:12,577
Of course, nothing did happen,
last night.

478
00:48:13,488 --> 00:48:15,066
It wasn't nothing.

479
00:48:17,175 --> 00:48:18,267
I'm sorry.

480
00:48:18,957 --> 00:48:20,615
Sorry, for what?

481
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:26,821
For stopping something,
that could ruin our friendship.

482
00:48:27,064 --> 00:48:30,417
And the chance of something better, maybe,
happening in the future.

483
00:48:34,738 --> 00:48:37,008
It's yours. Thank you, dagen.

484
00:48:37,158 --> 00:48:39,627
You really are the perfect gentleman.

485
00:48:42,414 --> 00:48:44,169
Not a perfect gentleman.

486
00:48:44,727 --> 00:48:47,473
Something is better than
nothing, after all.

487
00:49:37,522 --> 00:49:39,140
This must be it.

488
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:40,838
The rose.

489
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:45,606
I frequented better.

490
00:49:46,218 --> 00:49:47,408
I frequented worse.

491
00:49:47,796 --> 00:49:49,767
The tired soldiers could do worse.

492
00:50:13,459 --> 00:50:15,167
Get your hands of me.

493
00:50:17,772 --> 00:50:19,539
I'm waiting outside.

494
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,359
I don't like to be touched by creatures
as diseased and vile as these.

495
00:50:23,566 --> 00:50:26,039
The three of you search for the eel
and his woman.

496
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:29,100
If you find either of them,
bring them to me, immediately.

497
00:50:29,135 --> 00:50:30,078
Allright.

498
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,107
Immediately. Understood.

499
00:50:34,711 --> 00:50:37,232
Hello and welcome, travelers.

500
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,665
Good lady of the rose,
we have travelled far for this...

501
00:50:41,222 --> 00:50:42,555
Pleasure.

502
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:48,734
And pleasure ye shall have. We're, eh...
Looking for a woman named yuliya.

503
00:50:49,068 --> 00:50:50,120
Sorry...

504
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:53,089
Is there a woman here
called yuliya, yet?

505
00:50:53,419 --> 00:50:56,548
We must see her.
For two, please.

506
00:50:58,354 --> 00:50:59,609
Three silver.

507
00:51:00,229 --> 00:51:01,490
No, wait.

508
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:04,289
No, no, no. We just want to talk to her.

509
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,153
She's a very popular girl.

510
00:51:08,504 --> 00:51:09,540
Each.

511
00:51:18,388 --> 00:51:19,539
Yes!

512
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:23,412
Yuliya?

513
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:29,628
I love you ears.

514
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:32,216
They're hardly my best feature.
Allright.

515
00:51:32,218 --> 00:51:34,867
Come on. You brought friends.

516
00:51:34,999 --> 00:51:38,865
We can play...
We're not here for your services.

517
00:51:38,963 --> 00:51:40,084
Well...

518
00:51:41,571 --> 00:51:44,385
I mean... not initially, no.

519
00:51:47,959 --> 00:51:50,283
Well, I don't have any more sniff.

520
00:51:50,285 --> 00:51:53,537
So, whoever told you I was selling
gave you old information.

521
00:51:53,588 --> 00:51:54,696
Sorry.

522
00:51:55,144 --> 00:51:56,789
Actually, we're eh...

523
00:51:57,926 --> 00:52:01,540
We're looking for a smuggler,
called the eel.

524
00:52:03,394 --> 00:52:05,039
Is he a friend of yours?

525
00:52:07,301 --> 00:52:08,607
Yuliya?

526
00:52:08,761 --> 00:52:12,856
Shouldn't we take her to betylla?
I'm not letting him anywhere near her.

527
00:52:13,613 --> 00:52:15,729
Why not? He'll kill her.

528
00:52:15,814 --> 00:52:18,981
He will kill thane if he finds out
that we've lied to him.

529
00:52:19,952 --> 00:52:22,575
Betylla needs us just as much
as we need him.

530
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:24,193
It'll be fine.

531
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,055
Yuliya.

532
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:30,606
Where is he?

533
00:52:33,022 --> 00:52:36,243
Finding him,
could save a close friend.

534
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:41,098
I haven't seen him in...
Close on two moons.

535
00:52:42,624 --> 00:52:46,464
Its... and he was going on about a ship
to the eastern kingdoms.

536
00:52:48,452 --> 00:52:51,738
He was more than just a friend.

537
00:52:52,981 --> 00:52:54,198
Is that all?

538
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:58,783
Did you want something else with me?

539
00:53:01,071 --> 00:53:03,368
No. No, thank you.

540
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:08,345
Marek...

541
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,078
Imbeciles!

542
00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:14,160
Where is the eel?
He's gone. He's gone!

543
00:53:17,468 --> 00:53:20,755
Worthy apetite
for a girl in the Chucks.

544
00:53:20,756 --> 00:53:24,219
How long you've been of the sniff,
a moon, yet?

545
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:28,216
She has told you everything she knows!
He's across the eastern sea by now!

546
00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:47,731
Have mercy, betylla. Please, mercy!

547
00:53:47,732 --> 00:53:51,096
I can explain. This isn't my fault,
just listen to me.

548
00:53:51,097 --> 00:53:54,113
You owe peregus malister,
of the thieves guild,

549
00:53:54,115 --> 00:53:58,072
five stone of refined illustrium.
Where is it?

550
00:53:58,073 --> 00:54:00,803
Well, it's a funny story actually, befo...
Where?

551
00:54:02,231 --> 00:54:04,018
Golgotians, betylla.

552
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:06,229
The mine has been overrun
with golgotian soldiers.

553
00:54:06,231 --> 00:54:09,180
You're lying.
No I'm not. I'm sorry. I'm not lying.

554
00:54:09,214 --> 00:54:12,129
I only got out, because I know
the mines better than they do.

555
00:54:12,131 --> 00:54:14,258
They must be exporting to the east.

556
00:54:15,475 --> 00:54:18,412
If you don't have it
and you can't find it,

557
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,319
than you're of no use to the guild.
I can get you your shipment, I can get it!

558
00:54:22,354 --> 00:54:23,839
I can get it. How?

559
00:54:23,874 --> 00:54:25,550
When the golgotians attacked,

560
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:28,584
I stashed everything there was,
at least three stones worth,

561
00:54:28,774 --> 00:54:31,225
and I know where it is.
I can get it.

562
00:54:34,109 --> 00:54:35,841
You'll take us there.

563
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:37,535
Yuliya!

564
00:54:37,537 --> 00:54:39,647
Alton! Goodbye, my love!

565
00:54:40,473 --> 00:54:42,839
It was lovely to meet you.
Let's go.

566
00:54:46,146 --> 00:54:47,999
don't ever betray us like that again.

567
00:54:48,564 --> 00:54:50,888
I will do whatever it takes, marek.

568
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:52,816
I'm surprised you won't do the same.

569
00:55:12,714 --> 00:55:13,798
You see it?

570
00:55:14,776 --> 00:55:16,024
This is crawling with them.

571
00:55:16,026 --> 00:55:18,371
And what are golgotians
doing so far from their country?

572
00:55:18,372 --> 00:55:22,151
They've discovered the power
of voluntary enslavement.

573
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,535
They rarely steal the illustrium
for themselves.

574
00:55:25,892 --> 00:55:28,004
They're digging too fast, too deep.

575
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:31,890
The whole thing is gonna erupt,
if the cave demons don't get to them first.

576
00:55:31,892 --> 00:55:33,747
Then you better get on with it.

577
00:55:39,071 --> 00:55:40,896
Do you see that retreat down there?

578
00:55:41,452 --> 00:55:43,274
It's where I dropped your shipment.

579
00:55:49,097 --> 00:55:50,187
Who's he?

580
00:55:50,276 --> 00:55:51,709
The man in charge.

581
00:55:52,037 --> 00:55:53,681
His name is to kora.

582
00:55:53,682 --> 00:55:55,347
He doesn't look golgotian to me.

583
00:55:57,022 --> 00:56:00,361
I shouldn't have come. We're all...
Calm down. What's gotten into you?

584
00:56:00,363 --> 00:56:03,539
He's looking for me. He knows I'm here.
Who's looking for... who's looking for you?

585
00:56:03,624 --> 00:56:05,367
Hey, you're scarring me.

586
00:56:09,238 --> 00:56:10,818
He knows I'm here.

587
00:56:11,325 --> 00:56:13,725
Are you talking about the man in the cloak?

588
00:56:14,461 --> 00:56:17,368
He's not even looking this way,
he's gone into a tent.

589
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,740
To kora.

590
00:56:18,771 --> 00:56:21,037
It means, "dark art" in golgotian.

591
00:56:21,356 --> 00:56:23,303
Marek, what is it? It's szorlok.

592
00:56:23,316 --> 00:56:24,611
It can't be.

593
00:56:24,678 --> 00:56:28,062
Why would he care about illustrium.
That's not why he's here.

594
00:56:28,492 --> 00:56:29,511
There.

595
00:56:30,752 --> 00:56:33,142
There. Is that the illustrium
they're burning up?

596
00:56:33,269 --> 00:56:34,693
That's it.

597
00:56:35,069 --> 00:56:38,468
We've burned it before with fire,
but that pile is worth a fortune.

598
00:56:41,437 --> 00:56:42,872
What?

599
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,638
What are they doing with it?

600
00:56:47,698 --> 00:56:51,022
We need to go, I think marek is right.
He's here for the darkspore.

601
00:56:51,024 --> 00:56:53,830
My only concern is your shipment.

602
00:56:53,832 --> 00:56:56,481
It's the only thing
that will save your precious friend.

603
00:56:56,482 --> 00:56:57,519
Yes.

604
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,917
This shipment is what matters most.

605
00:57:18,178 --> 00:57:20,632
It's a good day for you, vitalion.

606
00:57:20,633 --> 00:57:23,182
I've seen another one
of betylla's beetles.

607
00:57:23,897 --> 00:57:25,626
I guess...

608
00:57:25,627 --> 00:57:28,638
I don't get to kill you
for one more day.

609
00:57:31,256 --> 00:57:35,792
I'm disappointed in you, thane. I'd had
thought you'd had more fight in you.

610
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,035
What?

611
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:45,196
Speak up!

612
00:57:48,903 --> 00:57:50,544
She loves me.

613
00:57:50,859 --> 00:57:53,568
And there is nothing you can do
to take that away.

614
00:57:58,705 --> 00:58:00,410
Oh, gods.

615
00:58:00,412 --> 00:58:03,707
You're being a man,
before I even put a finger on you.

616
00:58:03,816 --> 00:58:05,439
That's something...

617
00:58:06,073 --> 00:58:07,921
You will never know.

618
00:58:09,749 --> 00:58:11,115
Shut your face!

619
00:58:11,705 --> 00:58:15,401
Never tell your enemy
what you value the most.

620
00:58:31,156 --> 00:58:33,185
It's just over this next Ridge.

621
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:35,515
Now's our chance.

622
00:58:59,968 --> 00:59:01,157
He can't have gotten far.

623
00:59:01,158 --> 00:59:03,390
Is this the way you left it?
It is.

624
00:59:03,772 --> 00:59:05,604
What exactly are we looking for?

625
00:59:05,948 --> 00:59:08,330
A brown bag, about this big.

626
00:59:08,682 --> 00:59:11,164
Let's split up. Do as he says.

627
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:20,778
Find it. Now.

628
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,709
No. No, no, no, no. Be careful.

629
00:59:38,633 --> 00:59:39,944
Cave demons.

630
00:59:55,854 --> 00:59:57,107
Golgotians!

631
01:00:00,533 --> 01:00:02,073
I told you...

632
01:00:09,435 --> 01:00:12,191
That... was a stupid move.

633
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:31,153
Marek, go!

634
01:00:51,117 --> 01:00:52,624
We have to save thane.

635
01:00:52,972 --> 01:00:54,352
No! No!

636
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:56,374
That's stupid, run!

637
01:02:21,834 --> 01:02:23,892
We can't just keep wandering around.

638
01:02:24,392 --> 01:02:26,004
There must be another way out.

639
01:02:28,732 --> 01:02:30,205
Illustrium.

640
01:03:03,008 --> 01:03:04,582
It's beautiful.

641
01:03:26,861 --> 01:03:28,738
It's so pure.

642
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:37,084
The hell with the gods,
that's a pretty thing.

643
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:40,550
What do you suppose that's worth?
I knew it.

644
01:03:40,551 --> 01:03:41,977
What, what is it?

645
01:03:42,011 --> 01:03:43,803
Your precious mold...

646
01:03:44,691 --> 01:03:47,089
It all stems from one corrupting source.

647
01:03:48,129 --> 01:03:50,700
The darkspore. That thing?

648
01:03:52,376 --> 01:03:55,321
The source of all illustrium?

649
01:03:55,506 --> 01:03:57,205
It's an evil thing.

650
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:00,754
With a dark purpose.
I must have it.

651
01:04:01,745 --> 01:04:03,769
And build an empire.

652
01:04:04,743 --> 01:04:07,307
It was meant to be lost
in this mine forever.

653
01:04:08,935 --> 01:04:12,743
All darkness,
eventually comes to light.

654
01:04:14,747 --> 01:04:16,390
I'll take it to gojun pye.

655
01:04:16,455 --> 01:04:18,289
Where he'll destroy it or hide it...

656
01:04:44,118 --> 01:04:46,120
You know who I am.

657
01:04:47,379 --> 01:04:49,509
Did you know what I seek?

658
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:53,224
You'll never get the darkspore.
The gods will see to it that you fail.

659
01:04:53,225 --> 01:04:54,963
The gods...

660
01:04:55,417 --> 01:05:00,455
What can the gods do to stop me
when I have the power over life and death?

661
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:04,383
I am not afraid to die.

662
01:05:17,412 --> 01:05:22,716
This amuses me.
You are willing to die, even for marek.

663
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,272
Eventhough, in time...

664
01:05:25,274 --> 01:05:28,370
She will be the cause
of your own destruction.

665
01:05:28,834 --> 01:05:31,155
You know this to be true.

666
01:05:31,713 --> 01:05:34,814
Yet, you cannot help
but serve her purpose.

667
01:05:37,861 --> 01:05:39,307
She will...

668
01:05:39,374 --> 01:05:40,709
Never...

669
01:05:41,386 --> 01:05:42,992
Help you.

670
01:05:42,993 --> 01:05:46,108
Oh, but she already has.

671
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:50,189
She has already brought me two pieces
of the hart of amon ka.

672
01:05:50,745 --> 01:05:53,754
She'll surely inevitably
bring me the third.

673
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:58,196
She cannot escape het destiny!

674
01:06:02,187 --> 01:06:05,749
She cannot escape... me.

675
01:07:15,254 --> 01:07:17,479
Now, I never thought it
would end like this.

676
01:07:18,472 --> 01:07:21,767
Too young to die.
I'm still in my early seventies.

677
01:07:22,604 --> 01:07:23,885
I'm sorry.

678
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:27,191
This is not your fault, nor your fight.
No...

679
01:07:27,325 --> 01:07:29,122
Please, come on.

680
01:07:29,207 --> 01:07:32,388
You know me better than that.
I'm in it for the money.

681
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:34,071
For the long hole.

682
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,539
I do know you better than that.

683
01:07:37,198 --> 01:07:39,048
You came for marek.

684
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:47,899
[My strength is my weakness.]

685
01:07:51,577 --> 01:07:54,001
We all have strengths and weaknesses.

686
01:08:06,093 --> 01:08:07,097
No.

687
01:08:07,258 --> 01:08:08,721
No, no no.

688
01:09:45,863 --> 01:09:47,236
To marek.

689
01:09:51,017 --> 01:09:52,270
Gross.

690
01:09:54,636 --> 01:09:56,306
Where do they hide?

691
01:09:56,307 --> 01:09:57,307
No, n...

692
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:00,579
Ehm, never mind, don't wanna know.

693
01:10:01,622 --> 01:10:05,370
I will never have another scandalous
thought about you again, now, I swear.

694
01:10:06,731 --> 01:10:07,798
Hey...

695
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:11,182
At least you managed to save thane
for another day, huh?

696
01:10:14,749 --> 01:10:16,721
I didn't send it to thane.

697
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:57,988
Home.

698
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:09,855
Time to go.

699
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:12,912
Marek, it's a trap. Walk away, please.
No, no. No, no.

700
01:14:21,339 --> 01:14:22,579
Thank you.

701
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:25,046
Come on.

702
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:43,591
Thane!

703
01:15:10,019 --> 01:15:11,419
You bastard!

704
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:22,193
So...

705
01:15:22,874 --> 01:15:26,073
You've come to face me,
as I knew you would.

706
01:15:26,615 --> 01:15:28,546
Now, release my friends.

707
01:15:28,547 --> 01:15:32,448
Release them yourself.
Release them... yourself...

708
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:34,499
Release them yourself.

709
01:15:51,323 --> 01:15:54,923
They are surrounded...
Surrounded by enemies.

710
01:15:58,547 --> 01:16:02,050
Surrounded...
Surrounded by enemies.

711
01:16:31,356 --> 01:16:33,662
Release your power. Your power.

712
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:37,490
Take. Take. Take, their lifeforce.

713
01:16:38,993 --> 01:16:43,647
Take their lifeforce
and free your friend.

714
01:16:43,649 --> 01:16:48,176
There is no other way.
To free your friends.

715
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:34,596
I will give you the darkspore.
Now, let them go.

716
01:17:36,226 --> 01:17:39,980
The shard is already mine
for the taking.

717
01:17:50,857 --> 01:17:55,494
Take your place.
Give me what I desire most.

718
01:17:56,278 --> 01:18:00,069
Take your place on my side.

719
01:18:04,691 --> 01:18:08,510
Take your place on my side.

720
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:18,886
See how they suffer?

721
01:18:22,771 --> 01:18:26,418
You can save them, marek.

722
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:43,446
I'm nothing like you.

723
01:18:44,372 --> 01:18:45,887
I'm not a murderer.

724
01:18:46,324 --> 01:18:48,034
No,

725
01:18:48,069 --> 01:18:52,834
you're not like me, you are nothing
like me, you insolent child.

726
01:18:54,466 --> 01:18:58,230
Now, you will suffer the fate
of all who defy me.

727
01:19:20,351 --> 01:19:21,607
Take my life.

728
01:19:22,047 --> 01:19:23,217
And use it.

729
01:19:24,962 --> 01:19:26,511
Save dagen.

730
01:19:28,436 --> 01:19:32,368
No. No, teela. I give my life freely.
Freely as a sacrifice.

731
01:19:32,454 --> 01:19:34,293
It's alright to take it.

732
01:19:36,864 --> 01:19:38,117
No.

733
01:19:38,336 --> 01:19:40,480
I'm not gonna make it. No.

734
01:19:45,075 --> 01:19:46,547
It is alright.

735
01:20:04,815 --> 01:20:06,062
Goddess,

736
01:20:06,163 --> 01:20:08,056
grant me your glory.

737
01:20:09,959 --> 01:20:11,290
Goddess...

738
01:22:14,253 --> 01:22:15,830
Oh, marek.

739
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:22,214
Hold still, hold... no, no, no.

740
01:22:22,216 --> 01:22:24,154
You did everything right.

741
01:22:24,633 --> 01:22:27,123
don't weep, you did everything right.

742
01:22:28,792 --> 01:22:30,970
It's okay, you're alright, now?

743
01:22:31,985 --> 01:22:35,641
You did everything right.
Come one. Come on.

744
01:24:04,587 --> 01:24:05,622
Okay.

745
01:24:06,418 --> 01:24:10,431
Alright, you rest.
That's a good girl, you rest.

746
01:24:21,722 --> 01:24:23,454
We'll see what's left of me.

747
01:24:35,985 --> 01:24:37,074
Sorry.

748
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:40,244
I'm sorry.

749
01:24:41,328 --> 01:24:44,113
I killed her. Oh, no, no, no.

750
01:24:45,196 --> 01:24:46,686
No, no, no.

751
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:48,811
Look at me.

752
01:24:48,812 --> 01:24:51,432
Teela sacrificed herself for thane.

753
01:24:51,534 --> 01:24:54,033
And for us. Okay?

754
01:24:55,205 --> 01:24:58,580
But if we don't hurry,
her blood really will... be on our hands.

755
01:24:58,654 --> 01:25:01,529
So, I need you to walk, okay?

756
01:25:01,963 --> 01:25:04,765
Can you walk?
That's it, girl. Come on.

757
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,906
Come on, I need you to walk.
Come on. Come on!

758
01:25:07,908 --> 01:25:09,774
It's okay, lets walk.

759
01:25:09,775 --> 01:25:12,537
Okay. All right, together.

760
01:25:12,538 --> 01:25:15,137
Ready? Okay, try.

761
01:25:29,538 --> 01:25:30,785
Wake up.

762
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:32,913
Come on.

763
01:25:35,078 --> 01:25:37,503
I didn't get my beetle, today.

764
01:25:38,256 --> 01:25:40,736
Guess that means your friends are dead.

765
01:25:45,922 --> 01:25:47,721
Huh? Kill you.

766
01:25:47,915 --> 01:25:49,627
Why don't you speak up?

767
01:25:53,332 --> 01:25:55,811
I'll kill you! Yeah!

768
01:25:56,498 --> 01:25:58,891
Yes, I believe you would.

769
01:26:00,473 --> 01:26:02,163
That is why...

770
01:26:02,421 --> 01:26:05,413
You must die, vitalion.

771
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:18,153
Let him... go.

772
01:26:22,012 --> 01:26:23,419
Good timing.

773
01:26:24,348 --> 01:26:25,405
Men!

774
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,238
Where is she?

775
01:26:30,272 --> 01:26:32,789
We'll talk about it, when we're
out of here, thane, my friend.

776
01:26:32,824 --> 01:26:34,279
Unfortunately,

777
01:26:34,561 --> 01:26:36,555
I'm not letting anybody leave today.

778
01:26:37,223 --> 01:26:38,864
I'm gonna kill thane,

779
01:26:39,338 --> 01:26:41,216
and I'm gonna kill both of you.

780
01:26:44,345 --> 01:26:45,842
Finish them!

781
01:27:04,287 --> 01:27:05,368
Die!

782
01:27:19,695 --> 01:27:21,025
Where's teela?

783
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:25,373
It's complicated, my friend.

784
01:27:30,923 --> 01:27:32,144
Is she hurt?

785
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:35,642
I'm sorry.

786
01:27:37,512 --> 01:27:39,122
I'm so sorry.

787
01:29:22,257 --> 01:29:24,845
Teela sacrificed herself,

788
01:29:24,846 --> 01:29:27,561
to save you, thane.

789
01:29:29,944 --> 01:29:31,798
To save, you.

790
01:30:29,984 --> 01:30:31,302
You were right.

791
01:30:32,141 --> 01:30:33,489
I shouldn't have gone.

792
01:30:36,132 --> 01:30:38,780
I know the resting place
of the fourth shard.

793
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,043
Szorlok has no way to find it.

794
01:30:43,494 --> 01:30:46,784
So, we will watch and fight,
if it'll come to that.

795
01:30:47,876 --> 01:30:49,391
Until then...

796
01:30:50,598 --> 01:30:52,312
We stand ready.

797
01:31:06,012 --> 01:31:07,381
You're packing late?

798
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:09,196
It's a long journey.

799
01:31:12,093 --> 01:31:14,185
What's the plan with szorlok, then?

800
01:31:14,186 --> 01:31:15,760
He's a mortal man.

801
01:31:15,877 --> 01:31:18,131
He breathes, he eats.

802
01:31:18,281 --> 01:31:19,789
He sleeps.

803
01:31:20,091 --> 01:31:21,833
He bleeds.

804
01:31:25,211 --> 01:31:27,720
There's not a place in the world
he can hide.
