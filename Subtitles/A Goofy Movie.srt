1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,109
Yeow-hoo-hooeee!

3
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,714
Maa-ax!

Roxanne?

7
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,243
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

8
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,085
- Ahh.
- Oh!

9
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,474
What's wrong?

10
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,728
Argh!

11
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,982
Argh! Ooo-ooo.

12
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,027
Aah! Oh!

13
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,158
- Argh! No!
- Look!

14
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,873
- Ayuk! O-O-Oh!

15
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,219
Uh... Ahh! Hello?
Ahem. Hello.

16
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,055
<i>Max, where the heck are you, man?</i>

17
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,265
<i>- P.J.?
- You should've been here an hour ago.</i>

18
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,726
What? What are... Hold on.

19
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,019
Oh, no!

20
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,772
<i>Look, maybe we should just
call the whole thing off.</i>

21
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:27,898
No way, man.

22
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,192
It's now or never. Oooh!

23
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,195
<i>You better get a move on.
I'll meet you at my locker.</i>

24
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,032
Ayuk! Mornin', son!

25
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,533
Dad!

26
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,911
Oops! I forgot.

27
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,581
Ayuk! Mornin', son!

28
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,584
Came to see if you had any...
dirty clothes.

29
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,586
Well, there they are. Help yourself.

30
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,255
Max, I thought we talked about this.

31
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,425
Look, I'm sorry, Dad.
I-I'll take care of it later. Ow!

32
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,844
- What's the big rush?
- I'm running late.

33
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,805
I could drive ya on my way to work.

34
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,390
Uh, no. No, thanks.

35
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,352
- I, uh, need the exercise.
- Aw, come on, Max. Huh?

36
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,814
Dad! No, don't do it!

37
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,233
Don't... No!

38
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,153
Oh, Dad, you ruined it.

39
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,738
Sorry 'bout that.

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,448
Who was he, anyway?

41
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,077
It's only Powerline, Dad.
The biggest rock star on the planet.

42
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:26,456
Ooh, not bigger than
Xavier Cugat, the Mambo King.

43
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:30,293
Everybody mambo!
<i>Boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom</i>

44
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,463
Dad, there's no time for this.
What if the neighbors see us?

45
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,006
<i>Boom-boom-boom'</i>

46
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,385
Maxie, wait up!

47
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,804
You forgot your lunch.

48
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,724
- Have a good day!
- Duh... Ah!

49
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,851
Huh.

50

<i>They've been laughin'

Whoa! Dah! Argh!

- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

94
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,655
I just, uh... Dah...

95
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,244
Ayuk!

96

Oh.

97
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,293
Argh!

98
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,882
I can't believe I did that!

99
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,302
Urgh! She finally says
"Hi" to me, and what do I do?

100
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,721
I... choke! Urgh!

101
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:28,972
Ayuk!

102
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,517
- Like a big spaz!
- Where have you been, buddy?

103
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,729
Uh. Hi, Peej. Did you get the camera?

104
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,065
Look, Max, if my dad catches me
with this, he'll kill me!

105
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,734
Are you sure we gotta do this?

106
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,736
It's my only chance, Peej.

107
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,822
To Roxanne, I'm... I'm just a nobody.

108
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,908
But after today...

109
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,368
Bobby!

110
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,748
Wow, look! All this is for us?

111
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,252
Mmm, slurpage!

112
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,338
Oh, this is gonna be so great, man!

113
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,215
Dude. Need fund-age, bro.

114
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,551
Oh, your fee. Yeah, yeah. Right here.

115
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,803
Ahhh!

116
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,057
Cheddar! Aah-ooh!

117
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,726
Cheddar whizzy!

118
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,190
Mmm. Mmm.

119
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,277
Mmm. It's pretty scrumptious.

120
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,989
Ha-ha! Let's do it, ladies!

121
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,787
As student body president,
I just wanna say like "yea"...

122
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,623
- To all of us for a really neat year.
- Yo, Stacey!

123
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,085
Talk to me, talk to me,
talk to me, baby!

124
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,878
And also that I hope you can all attend

125
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,589
my totally amazing end-of-school party
next Saturday

126
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,133
to watch the Powerline
concert live on pay-per-view.

127
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,929
Thank you, thank you very much.

128
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,974
And now, without further ado,
Principal Mazur.

129
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,896
Thank you, Stacey.

130
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,315
And good morning, boys and girls.

131
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,276
You know, every year
on the last day of school

132
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,989
I have several youngsters
approach me and say,

133
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,952
"Principal Mazur, what can we do
to not waste our summer vacation?"

134
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,579
- "We don't want to waste our free time"

135
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,957
- "sleeping or visiting friends.”

136
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,335
Say, Roxanne, about Stacey's party.

137
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,468
How you, uh...
How you doin' down there, Bobby?

138
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:34,514
Don't give me that attitude, you guys.
I'm doin' it all for you.

139
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,685
This is nuts.

140
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,563
I don't know why
I let you guys talk me into this.

141
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,316
If my dad finds out, he's gonna nuke
my entire existence... Ah!

142
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,152
...of the element, or...

143
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,070
Heh-heh-heh.

144
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,197
I hope this works.

145
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,493
How about... science slumber parties?

146
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,287
Huh?

147
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,502
Wha...

148
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,379
Hey!

149
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,466
I'm not gonna just... Aaah!

150
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,011
Ha-ha-ha-ha-hah!

151
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,973

157
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,241
Whaaa!

158

00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,918
<i>'Til mine is the only face you'll see</i>

161
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:49,380
<i>Gonna stand out
'Til you notice me, yeah</i>

162
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:55,053
A little smoke-age!

163
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,848
<i>If I can make you stop and
Take a look at me instead of just</i>

164
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,601
<i>Walkin' by</i>

165
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,688
<i>There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
If it was gettin' you to notice</i>

166
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,399
I'm <i>alive</i>

167
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,278
<i>All I need is half a chance
A second thought, a second glance</i>

168
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,990
<i>To prove I've got whatever it takes</i>

169
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,325
It's a piece of cake.

170
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,620
<i>To stand out above the crowd'</i>

171
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,623
Wow! Who's that guy?

172
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,751
<i>'Til mine is the only face you'll see</i>

173
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,921
<i>Gonna stand out...</i>

174
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,931
Hey, it's the Goof boy!

175
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,183
We're busted!

176
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,435
Hmph.

177
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,149
Gaga-booja-boo
boo-boo-boo.

178
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,193
Ayuk! Come on, smile!

179
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,195
Smiley-Wiley!

180
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,948
Blaa-aa-aa.
Ayuk!

181
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,742
Oh, come on, Kimmie.
Gimme a big...

00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,955

Whee!

184
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,584
- Ahh! Whee!

185
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,171

00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,508
- Ahh!

188
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,136
Stop goofin' around!

189
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,013
We got work to do!

190
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,515
Okay, Kimmie, back to Mommy now.

191
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,476
- Ayuk! BIaa-aa-aa.
- Ahh.

192
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,021
You're such a cute little girlie.

193
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,774
- Mmm.
- Oh, come back and see me.

194
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,236
Oh, you have such a way with children.

195
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,448
"You have such a way with children."

196
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,490
Pah!

197
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,327
Okay, now. Who's next over here?

198
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,830
Step aside, Goof.
Let a pro Show you how it's done.

199
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,500
Okay. Who's next over here?
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

200
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,003
Ooh, hello, precious...

201
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,839
Oooh! Oooh!

202
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,841
You lucky woman. Heh.

203
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,968
Now, now, you come on here, honey.

204
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,304
- It's picture time. Come on.
- Peekaboo!

205
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,973
- She's so cute.
- Peekaboo!

206
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,644
Gosh, Pete, you sure are good with kids.

207
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,730
- Oh, yeah. Well, they love me.
- Argh!

208
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:15,568
Ha-ha. Why P.J., he's been beggin' me
to take him on vacation this summer.

209
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,528
Really? Where ya goin'?

210
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,696
Campin'!

211
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,657
Nothing like the great outdoors

212
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,410
to strengthen the bond
between a father and a son.

213
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,538
- Argh!
- Max'd never go for anything like that.

214
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,374
- I don't know, Goof.
- Ooh! Gimme, gimme.

215
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,086
Somethin's wrong when a kid won't
spend time with his parents.

216
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,214
Well, for all you know,
he's runnin' around with some gang,

217
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,008
and stealin' stuff,
and causin' riots and...

218
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,885
Waaa! Gimme!

219
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,720
Oh, Max is a good kid.

220
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,098
He'd never get mixed up
in somethin' like that.

221
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,816
I'm a failure.

222
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,859
Complete loser.

223
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,405
My one chance to impress Roxanne
and I blew it.

224
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,614
Uh-huh!

225
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,700
Max, look.

226
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,412
It's the Leaning Tower of Cheese-a. Huh.

227
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,958
Oh, man.

228
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,919
My dad is gonna smash me like a bug.

229
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,423
Hey, P.J., detention!

230
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,633
Robert Zimuruski.

231
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,429
Okay. I'm comin'.

232
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,638
Max, here.

233
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,391
Guard this with your life, dude.

234
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,275
Hey, Maz-u-ur!

235
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,277
What's up, bro? All right.

236
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,779
Then my parents' air conditioner
went on the fritz.

237
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,115
I figured with all those kids in my house,
the place a be like a sauna.

238
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,200
So I'm all freaked out,
but then I thought, like, use it.

239
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,620
So my theme's gonna be,
"Powerline Goes Rain Forest."

240
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,747
Too much?

241
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,207
Roxanne, are you listening?

242
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,795
Oh!

243
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,382
- Stacey, no! I don't wanna...
- Talk to him.

244
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,426
Ahem!

245
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,179
<i>A-A-Ahem'.
Hmm.</i>

246
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,847
Tap him.

247
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,987
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay... really.

248
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,826
Um, I liked your dance.

249
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,495
Yeah.

250
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,496
Yeah?

251
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,539
Yeah, it's from Powerline's new video.

252
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,833
I know. H-He's totally a genius.

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,127
Yeah. He's doing a concert
next week in LA.

254
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,505
Oh, yeah.
Stacey's showing it at her party.

255
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,548
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

256
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,136
Um, uh, Roxanne...

257
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,641
I was, uh, sorta, kinda
thinkin' that maybe I'd, um,

258
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:56,062
ask you to, uh, go with me,
that is to the... party.

259
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,773
Of course if you don't want to,
I'd completely understand.

260
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:03,778
Well, I was sorta, kind of
thinkin' that... I'd love to.

261
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,405
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

262
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,864
- Good.
- Great.

263
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,074
- Terrific.
- Wonderful.

264
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,909
- All right.
- Okay.

265
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,162
C'mon, Roxanne. We don't want
to belabor the moment now, do we?

266
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,123
Well, I'd better be going.

267
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,250
I'll, uh, call you later.

268
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,334
Okay.

269
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,919
Bye. Oh.

270
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,922
Bye.

271
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,677
See, that wasn't so bad.
I told you men are easy to deal with.

272
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,054
Yes! She said yes!

273
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,265
Ya-ha-ha-hoo!

Ah, yes. Mr. Goof.

285
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,295
This is Principal Mazur.

286
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,256
I'm calling in regard
to your son Maximilian.

287
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,967
Max? Oh, my gosh! Is he hurt?

288
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,594
No, Mr. Goof.

289
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:10,928
He's in trouble!

290
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,097
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

291
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,433
<i>- Dressed like a gang member...

295
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,154
<i>I'd seriously reevaluate the way

296
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,073
before he ends up in the electric chair!

297
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,951
The electric chair?

298
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,746
Oh!

299
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,665

- You were right, Pete.

306
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,036
Nothin' like the great outdoors

00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,539
to strengthen the bond
between father and son.

00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,072
Way to go, man!

319
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,324
I just heard about you and Roxanne.

320
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,868
Oh, Pete! OW!

321
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,038
See, see? I told you
our plan would work!

322
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,292
- Max! Max! Max!
- Peej, knock it off. Come on. Shh.

323
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,212
- Maximum! Maxi-mu-um!
- Max! Max!

324
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:12,049
Max! Max! Max! Max! Max!

325
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,844
Max! Max! Max! Yeah!

326
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,847
<i>All I need is half a chance
A second thought, a second glance</i>

327
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,225
<i>To prove I've got whatever it takes</i>

328
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,352
It's a piece of cake.

329
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,856
<i>To stand out above the crowd'</i>

330
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,984
<i>Even if! gotta shout out loud</i>

331
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,403
<i>'Til mine is the only face you'll see</i>

332
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,866
<i>Gonna stand out
Stand out, heh</i>

333
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,492
<i>Stand out'</i>

334
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,286
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

335
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,038
<i>Stand out'</i>

336
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:46,459
<i>'Til mine is the only face you'll see</i>

337
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,086
<i>Gonna stand out'</i>

338
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,254
<i>'Til you notice me</i>

339
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,633
Goin' somewhere, Pop?

340
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,428
- Sure are, pal-a-roony.
- Cool. Have a good time, Dad.

341
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,014
If you're gonna be gone
more than a month, drop me a line.

342
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,767
But, Max, this isn't just my vacation.

343
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,895
It's a vacation with me
and my best buddy.

344
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,148
- Oh, Donald Duck?
- No, silly. With you!

345
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,905
Are you okay, Maxie?

346
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,115
Wh-What did you say?

347
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,450
That's right!

348
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,285
A vacation, son!

349
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,789
We'll spend some
real quality time together!

350
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,165
I think I'm gonna be sick.

351
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,042
Hey, got a present for ya!

352
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,503
Dad, stop that!
What are you doing?

353
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,925
You look just like I did at your age.

354
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,635
Please don't say that, Dad.

355
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:41,055
Wait! I saved the best for last. Ayuk!

356
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,976
It's been handed down
from Goof to Goof to Goof.

357
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,312
And now, it's yours, son.

358
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,690
- A stick?
- No, silly.

359
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,149
A fishin' pole!

360
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,194
Fishing? We're going fishing?

361
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,072
Yep. Just like my dad and me did.

362
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,033
Two best buddies fishin' on Lake Destiny.

363
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,035
Away from it all!

364
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,955
I don't wanna be
"away" from it all, Dad.

365
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,790
I like "it all"!

366
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,669
Look, Maxie, we're using
the same map me and my dad used.

367
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,755
We'll take the same route,
and make the same stops...

368
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,757
- And see the same sights.
- Ahh!

369
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,302
- But that trip would take weeks, Dad!
- Exactly!

370
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,304
Gettin' there is half the fun.

371
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,681
Put the map away, Dad.

372
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,767
- It's not gonna happen. I'm tellin' ya.
- Careful, son. You'll wrinkle my past.

373
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,186
Ayuk! And our future.

374
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,399
What the map says, Max,
we will follow.

375
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,985
That's very mystical
and everything, Dad,

376
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,447
but, uh, seriously, there's this party
I have to go to. And there's this girl...

377
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,824
There'll be plenty of time
for parties when you're older.

378
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,703
Why, when I was your age
I'd never even been invited to a party.

379
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,622
- Look at me now!
- Great, Dad.

380
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,000
- Hop in, Maxie.
- No.

381
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,046
All right, then.

382
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,174
Guess I'll just have to go...

383
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,842
all alone.

384
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,427
That's all.

385
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,890
Just sit in the boat all alone...

386
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,892
and talk to myself.

387
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,353
- All alone.
- I guess so.

388
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,689
- Oh, come on! Hop in!
- No, Dad.

389
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,150
- Just hop right in there.
- No.

390
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,278
- Come on, Maxie. Go for it!
- Argh! No.

391
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,781
Let's buckle you up!

392
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,116
And we're ready for takeoff! Ayuk.

393
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,704
Set for adventure, Maxie?

394
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,040
Why are you doing this to me, Dad?

395
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,710
'Cause I don't want ya
to end up in the electric chair.

396
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,754
Electric chair? What are you...

397
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,714
I'm not givin' up on ya, son.

398
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,592
Together, we're gonna work this out.

399
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,885
Work this out? But, Dad!

400
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,012
No buts about it, Maxie boy.

401
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,223
- Your ol' pop knows best.
- But...

402
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,688
Goodbye, house.
Goodbye, mailbox.

403
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,442
Goodbye, pile of broken wood.

404
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,446
Goodbye, hopes.

405
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:03,906
Goodbye, dreams.

406
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,407
Goodbye, Roxanne.

407
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,034
Roxanne!

408
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,829
Dad, I gotta stop somewhere first.
I have to talk to someone.

409
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,455
- Well...
- Turn here!

410
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,085
D-Dad, watch out! Aaah!

411
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,170
Stop here. Here! Pull over!

412
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,674
Now, make it quick, Maxie boy.

413
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,592
We gotta put some road behind us.

414
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:28,264
You get and cancel your first date
in less than an hour.

415
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,725
Must be some kind of lame-o record.

416
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,732
Hi. Is Roxanne home?

417
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,612
M-M-My name's Max.

418
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,448
Does Roxanne live here?

419
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,493
- Does she even live on this block? Ha-ha.
- Wait!

420
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,912
It's okay, Daddy.
Max is a friend from school.

421
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,206
Oh.

422
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,126
Go on. Go on.
Good Daddy.

423
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,296
- Hey, Max.
- Hi, there.

424
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,591
You wanna... uh, have a seat?

425
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,343
Hey. Uh... oh.

426
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,389
Daddy!

427
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,268
I promise, he'll be better behaved
when you pick me up for the party.

428
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,479
Yeah, that's, uh, sorta why I came by.

429
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,565
I'm really looking forward to it, Max.

430
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:23,402
- Yeah. I was too.
- Was?

431
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,363
You see, my dad's on this
stupid father-son kick and...

432
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,283
Don't worry about it, Max.
It's just a dumb party.

433
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,202
No, it's not. Roxanne,
I really wanted to go with you.

434
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,914
- Max, I understand. Really, it's okay.
- But my dad surprised me.

435
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,832
I don't wanna go, but I have no choice.

436
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:40,461
- I'm sure I can find someone else.
- Someone else?

437
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:44,381
- I'll just talk to you later.
- Uh, uh, Roxanne!

438
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,508
Uh, my dad is, uh...

439
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,678
My dad's taking me
to the Powerline concert in LA.

440
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,891
Your dad's taking you clear across
the country just to see a concert?

441
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:57,102
Uh, well, you see, uh,
my dad...

442
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,022
uh, knew... knows... knows Powerline.

443
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,024
They used to play together, in a band!

444
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,319
- Yeah!
- Come on, son!

445
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,071
Let's get this Show on the road!

446
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,073
Uh...
Just a minute!

447
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,451
You... party animal, you.

448
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,582
- You're really serious.
- Absolutely.

449
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,960
So, uh...

450
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,171
you aren't still thinkin'
of goin' with someone else, are you?

451
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,341
- Well, I guess...
- Because I was hopin'...

452
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,927
I could, uh, wave to you onstage

453
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,721
when we join Powerline
for the final number.

454
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,640
This is incredible.

455
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,517
Well, I wouldn't miss
our date for anything

456
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,060
that wasn't incredible, Roxanne.

457
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,145
Mwa.

458
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,650
Have a great time at the concert, Max.

459
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,361
I'll see you on TV!

460
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,947
Ah. I'm in deep sludge.

461
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,833
Day one.

462
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,751
Well, here we are,

463
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:06,463
<i>out on the open road,
retracin' the steps of my boyhood.</i>

464
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,967
<i>And here's Maxie! A yuk!</i>

465
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,844
<i>Say hi, Max.</i>

466
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:16,015
<i>- Well, how 'bout a wave?
- Not now, Dad.</i>

467
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,392
Ayuk! What a kidder!

468
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,731
Hmm.

469
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,737
Fun games I used to play with my dad.

470
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,824
Road bingo. Twenty ques...
Hey, Maxie.

471
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,159
Let's play a game.

472
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,828
You think of a name,
and I'll try and guess who it is.

473
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:40,497
- Uh, man or woman?
- Oh, man.

474
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,915
A man, huh?

475
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,168
Hmm, that's a toughie.

476
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,170
Uh, let's see.

477
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,672

478
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,382
I'm good at this.

479
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,092
Now, uh, I'll think of one.

480
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,553
Hmm.

481
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,141
Oh! You wanna sing a song, huh?

482
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:03,145
Me and my dad used to sing
this one all the time.

483
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,773
<i>High hopes</i>

Oh, g-great, Dad.

Oh, Maxie. It's not so bad.

493
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,188
We'll just have to entertain ourselves!

494
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,371
Putt-putt-poof!

495

500
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,893
<i>Do ya need a break from modern livin'?</i>

501
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,981
<i>Do you long to shed your weary load?</i>

502
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,817
<i>If your nerves are raw
And your brain is fried</i>

503

On the <i>open road</i>

505

<i>All in all, I'd rather have detention</i>

<i>Old man drives like such a klutz'</i>

510
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,631
<i>That I'm about to hurl my guts
Directly...</i>

511
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,885
<i>Upon the open road</i>

512

<i>Our trusty map will guide us
Straight and true</i>

515
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,770
<i>Roxanne, please don't forget me</i>

516
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,314
<i>I will return someday'</i>

517
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,902
<i>Though I may be in traction when I do</i>

518
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,780
<i>- Me and Max relaxin' like the old days
- This is worse...</i>

519
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,284
-...<i>Than dragon breath and acne
- In a buddy-buddy kind of way</i>

520
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,828
<i>I'm so mad I think I may explode</i>

521
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:28,624
<i>- When I see that highway I could cry
- That's funny, so could!</i>

522
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,252
<i>Just bein'</i> out on the <i>open road</i>

<i>Is this the way to Nashville?</i>

525
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,140
Watch it, Mac!

526

<i>Or you'll be gettin' towed</i>

527

<i>I'm in no hurry to arrive</i>

<i>'Cause I'll be turnin' sixty-five</i>

529
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,568
<i>The next time I sees the open road</i>

530
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:03,700
<i>- Just a week of rest and relaxation
- Yeah!</i>

531
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,745
<i>And the odd romantic episode</i>

532
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,497
Very odd!

533
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,582
<i>And it's Califor-ni-a or</i> bust

534
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,960
<i>Look out, you dirt-bags, eat my dust</i>

<i>From now on, I own the open road'</i>

536
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,341
<i>It's me and little Maxie'</i>

537
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,551
<i>My pip-squeak pioneer</i>

538

<i>They're partners forever, westward ho</i>

539
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,931
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!

540
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:30,310
<i>Could someone call a taxi
And get me outta here?</i>

541
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,897
<i>To Beverly Hills 90210</i>

542
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:38,068
<i>Oh, every day, another new adventure</i>

543
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:43,073
<i>Every mile, another new ZIP Code</i>

544
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:46,076
<i>And the cares we had are gone for good</i>

545
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,953
<i>And I'd go with them if! could</i>

546
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,247
<i>I got no strings on me'</i>

547
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,207
<i>I'm feelin' fancy free</i>

548
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,627
<i>How wonderful to be'</i>

549

- Why don't you just give me the map?
- Oh, no thanks, son.

556
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,626
Navigating's a big responsibility.

557
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:40,380
Besides, you wouldn't wanna
spoil the big surprise!

Who's your favorite possum?

601

Don't touch me.

602

Aww. Why such a long face?

603
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,405
You're so sad.

604
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,658
I know! You need a big hug from Lester.

605
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,119
- Don't even think about it! No!
- See?

606

Now you feel all good inside.

What say we get our picture taken?

610
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,475
- You have got to be kidding.
- Oh, all right.

611
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,101
But you're missin' out.

Urgh. Huh?

Hiya, son!

- Forget it!

631
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,185
I thought we was having fun.
What's the matter?

632
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,062
Nothin'. Let's just go.

633
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,064
Well, come on!

634
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,453
Hey, you dropped your hat.

635
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,414
Ah! This is the stupidest vacation!

636
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,125
You drag me from home,
you jam me in this dumb car,

637
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:31,087
then drive me a million miles away
to see some stupid rat Show!

638
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,423
Call me when the trip's over.

639
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,597
Hey, Max.

640
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,684
You wanna get in some fishin' practice?

641
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,354
Just a couple of days
'til we get to Lake Destiny.

642
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,815
Maybe later.

643
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,435
Whoa!

644
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,687
Now that's camping.

645
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,523
Did you say somethin', Max? Ow!

646
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,322
- Pete?
- Goofy?

647
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:25,368
Oh-ho! What a serendipity doo-dah!

648
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,704
<i>Who'd've thunk it, huh?</i>

649
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,707
- Is P.J. here?
- Who? Oh, yeah.

650
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,293
I'm sure he's loafin'
around here somewhere.

651
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,336
<i>It ain't a question of how</i>

652
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,505
<i>Just a matter of when'</i>

653
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,550
<i>You get the message
That I'm trying to sing</i>

654
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,762
<i>I'm under a spell, I'm in over my head</i>

655
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,223
<i>And you know I'm goin'
All of the way to the end</i>

656
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,391
What a goob!

657
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:52,228
<i>To stand out above the crowd</i>

658
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,064
<i>Even if you got to shout out loud</i>

659
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,650
<i>No matter what the look is
It's Max, I get...</i>

660
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:58,985
- Max!
- H-H-Hey!

661
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,404
Whoa! Small wilderness, dude.

662
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,157
- Didn't expect to run into you.
- Apparently not.

663
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,952
You're just jealous, man,
'cause you ain't got the moves!

664
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,704
Yeah, you can keep the moves.

665
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,374
But I wouldn't mind havin' this RV. Oh!

666
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,087
- You are so lucky, man.
- Me? Oh, come on. You're the star.

667
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,924
- Wh-What do you...
- Going to the Powerline concert.

668
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,886
- Ah! It's unbelievable, man.
- Who told you about that?

669
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,889
Hey, come on. Everybody in town
knows about it, Max.

670
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,391
You are gonna be famous, buddy.

671
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,894
Especially with Roxanne.

672
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:37,774
There's, uh, only one person
who doesn't know about it yet, Peej.

673
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,318
- Who?
- My dad.

674
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,570
So tell me, Goof.

675
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,948
Is that kid of yours
still givin' you guff?

676
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,574
Oh, I don't know what's wrong.

677
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,745
Just seems like everything I try
only drives Max further away.

678
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,581
Maybe I oughta just back off,
I don't know.

679
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,625
Wrong, Goof.

680
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,711
Look, if you keep 'em
under your thumb,

681
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,756
they'll never end up in the gutter.

682
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,889
Too bad, Pete. Almost.

683
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,808
Almost? Hah!

684
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,184
Watch this.

685
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,019
<i>PAH!</i>

686
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,647
Here, sir. Comin', sir. Yes, sir.

687
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,904
Whoo-hoo! Strike-Ola!

688
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,198
Yee-haw! Thank you.
Thank you. Yes!

689
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,784
And the crowd goes wild!
Ahh-ha-ha-ha!

690
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,119
High five, son!

691
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,328
Psych!

692
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,622
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

693
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,500
Say, Goof, why don't
you two stay for dinner?

694
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,003
- Cool!
- Oh, no thanks, Pete.

695
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:43,339
- Max and I have some fish to catch.
- Dad, we can do that tomorrow.

696
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,133
So, uh, what're we havin'?

697
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:49,262
- But, Max, I thought...
- Ahem! Under your thumb, Goof.

698
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,182
- Maximilian!
- What?

699
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,893
Get your gear, little man.

700
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,853
We're goin' fishin'!

701
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,273
And I mean now!

702
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,492
Dad, I don't even know how to fish.

703
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,912
Oh, now come on.
That never stopped me!

704
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,705
Let me Show you a little family secret,

705
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,500
handed down through
about 12 or 13 Goof generations.

706
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,170
The perfect cast!

707
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,880
The perfect what?

708
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,423
The perfect cast.

709
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,134
My dad taught it to me
when I was about your age.

710
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,179
Okay now, watch carefully.

711
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,681
You gotta be l-l-loose.

712
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,726
Relaxed, with your feet apart.

713
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,647
And... ten o'clock, two o'clock...

714
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,149
Quarter to three, <i>tour jeté.</i>

715
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,485
Twist, over, pas de <i>deux.</i>

716
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,321
<i>I'm a little teapot
And the</i> windup!

717
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:51,532
Huh?

718
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,285
And let her fly!

719
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,496
The perfect cast.

720
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,513
And now we reel her in.

721
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,851
Grrr. Ah! Ooh!

722
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,604
Oof! Grrr!

723
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,611
- Whoa!
- Grrr!

724
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,155
Quick, get the camera!

725
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,246
Must be over three pounds.

726
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,123
I don't wanna miss this!

727
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,377
Look, Max!

728
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,421
A... duh, D-Dad?

729
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,798
It's Bigfoot!

730
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,510
Could you back up a bit, Mr. Foot?
You're out of focus.

731
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:56,973
What's the idea?

732
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,518
Bigfoot!

733
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,734
Behold the legendary Bigfoot!

734
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,903
Fabled, but seldom...
Yeow-hoo-hoo!

735
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,323
- It's locked!
- Quick! The sunroof!

736
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:17,910
Hurry up!

737
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,331
Hurry up!

738
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,544
Huh?

739
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,087
Whoa!

740
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,799
I can't believe it!

741
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,801
Bigfoot!

742
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,179
And I got the only video!

743
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,389
We're gonna be famous!

744
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,644
Huh? Grrr.

745
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,772
Let's just get outta here.

746
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,322
Ha-ha!

747
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,286
Ooh.

748
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,506
Is he gone yet?

749
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,425
Mm-mm-mm-mm?

750
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,428
- Nnn. Bb-fftt.
- Bb-bbb-bbb.

751
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,390
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

752
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,894
Nope. He's still here.

753
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,063
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

754
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,779
Gee, Max, was that Bigfoot
or your stomach?

755
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,697
Man, I'm starving.

756
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,619
Ayuk! Alphabet Soup comin' up.

757
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:45,665
Huh?

758
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,167
Uh, Dad?

759
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,838
Dad!

760
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,799
Stop playing around! He's coming!

761
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,688
<i>You can tell by the way
I use my walk I'm a woman's man</i>

762
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,314
<i>No time to talk'</i>

763
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,694
<i>I've been kicked around
Since I was born</i>

764
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,779
<i>But then it's all right, it's okay</i>

765
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,659
Well, it's nice to know
this thing's good for somethin'.

766
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:30,001
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive</i>

767
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:33,087
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive...</i>

768
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,889
What's so funny?

769
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,224
"Hi, Dad" Soup.

770
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,601
Huh?

771
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,353
Don't tell me you don't remember
"Hi, Dad" Soup!

772
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,940
Oh, come on. Sure you do.

773
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,986
You used to spell things out
using the letters, like, uh, "Hi, Dad,"

774
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,946
- Or Maxie, or...
- Ambidextrous?

775
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,615
Yeah! That's... Huh?

776
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,075
No! Little words like...

777
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,494
- Hasta la vista?
- Like "Bye-bye."

778
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:09,248
- Or "I pledge allegiance"...
- Ayuk-ayuk. Or "I love you."

779
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,797
Is, uh... is it soup yet?

780
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,549
Oh, oh. I almost forgot.

781
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,928
Whoa! Where'd you learn to do that?

782
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,640
Your granddad taught me that
when we went to Yosemite.

783
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,975
You two did a lot together, huh?

784
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,435
Yep.

785
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,773
- Max, you and I...
- Dad, I'm sorry...

786
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,193
Um, um...
how's the soup?

787
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,529
Not bad. Um, not... Ahem.

788
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,326
- What?
- N-nothin'.

789
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,128
Well, we might as well

Changing the map?

860

I didn't know what I was doin',
all right? I-I was panicked.

Yeah, it's been great!

You know, it's funny, but none
of your techniques worked for me.

- Your kid's dupin' ya.
- What do you mean?

879
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:05,344
Well, I heard the little mutant tellin'
P.J. that he changed the map,

880
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:08,096
so you're headin' straight to LA, pal.

881
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,642
- What?
- Oh, you tried, Goof.

882
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,436
He's just a bad kid, that's all.

883
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,605
I don't believe you.

884
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:19,316
- What?
- I don't believe ya, Pete!

885
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:22,694
Well, hey, don't take my word for it.
Check your map.

886
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,947
I don't need to check the map.

887
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,657
I trust my son.

888
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,662
You know, maybe Max isn't all the things
that you think a son should be.

889
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,039
But... he loves me.

890
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,542
Hey, my son respects me!

891
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,044
Yeah.

892
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,090
Check the map, Goof!

893
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:19,877
Hi, Dad.

894
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,506
Sorry about the mess.
I-I'll clean it up.

895
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,854
- Me think I better go.
- See ya, Peej.

- Don't forget... Powerline!
- Shh!

897
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,188
Well, here you go, Navigator.

898
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,317
Just follow my route on the map, son.

899
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,528
Okay.

900
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,198
Um, huh...

901
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,618
Here comes our junction.

902
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,707
Okay, Max, now this is it.
Left or right?

903
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,417
Uh...

904
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,463
Come on, Max!

905
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:48,674
Uh, left!

906
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:04,272
Uh... how 'bout a song, Dad?

907
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:07,776
Uh... a game?

908
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,861
A game. Yeah!
Yeah, a game. Okay.

909
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,697
Uh... a man or woman?

910

A man? Man, okay.
Uh... Walt Disney!

911
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,978
Dad...

912
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,105
Listen, about my directions...

913
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:48,275
Will you listen to me?
I gotta tell you somethin', Dad.

914
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:52,237
Why bother? I'm probably too stupid
to understand anyway.

915
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:53,530
Right?

916
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,116
Ah, forget it.

917
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:12,883
H-H-Hey, the car!

918
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,510
- What? Now you want to drive, too?
- No, Dad.

919
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,304
The car! Look!

920
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,181
The car!

921
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,644
What'd you do now, Max?

922
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:26,605
I didn't do anything, Dad.
I only touched it.

923

924
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:37,908
You looked it!

925
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:41,078
I looked it? It's your door.
You looked it.

926
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:42,537
Well, you distracted me.

927
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:43,872
Whoa!

928
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,792
You should've put the brake on.

929
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,585
Why don't you just put it on yourself?

930
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:52,005
See? You ruin everything.

931
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,302
W-well, y-you r-ruined the vacation.

932
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,180
I ruined it?

933
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,808
I never... wanted to go...

934
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:04,476
on this stupid...

935
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,104
vacation!

936
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,573
Ah! Ah!

937
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,785
- Now look where you've got us, Dad!
- Where I got us?

938
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,121
- You should've let me stay at home.
- Why?

939
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,373
So you'd end up in prison?

940
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,501
Prison? What are you talkin' about?

941
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:32,838
- Your principal called me.
- It's not what you think.

942
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,923
You even lied to me!

943
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,217
I had to! You were ruining my life.

944
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,762
I was only tryin'
to take my boy fishin', okay?

945
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,640
I'm not your little boy any more, Dad!

946
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,225
I've grown up.

947
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,852
I've got my own life now.

948
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,395
I know that!

949
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,897
I just wanted to be part of it.

950
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,861
You're my son, Max.

951
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,988
No matter how big you get,

952
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,490
you'll always be my son.

953
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,960
<i>There are times you drive me
Shall we say, bananas</i>

954
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:58,465
<i>And your mind is missin'
No offense, a screw</i>

955
01:01:58,632 --> 01:01:59,549
None taken.

956
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:02,093
<i>Still, whatever mess I land in</i>

957
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,971
<i>Who is always understandin'?</i>

958
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,475
<i>Nobody else but you</i>

959
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:14,564
<i>Oh, your moodiness is
Now and then bewilderin'</i>

960
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,776
<i>And your values may be
Soto speak, askew</i>

961
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:19,110
<i>Gesundheit.
- Thanks.</i>

962
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,155
<i>Who deserves a hero's trophy</i>

963
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,366
<i>As we face each catastro-phee?</i>

964
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:28,787
<i>Nobody else but you</i>

965
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:34,125
Nobody <i>else</i> but you

966
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,127
<i>kit's just our luck'</i>

967
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:39,381
<i>We're stuck together</i>

968
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:43,551
<i>Nobody else but you</i>

969
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:49,099
<i>It's crazy enough to believe
We'll come through</i>

970
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:55,021
<i>So your jokes are all
Let's face it, prehistoric</i>

971
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:59,442
<i>And your music sounds
Like monkeys in a zoo</i>

972
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,446
<i>But when life becomes distressin"</i>

973
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,824
<i>Who will 1 be SOS-in'?</i>

974
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:08,201
<i>If you're havin' trouble guessing</i>

975
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,036
<i>Here's a clue'</i>

976
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,998
<i>Though he</i> seems <i>intoxicated</i>

977
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,750
<i>He's just highly animated</i>

978
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,586
<i>And he's nobody else but</i>

979
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:22,632
<i>Nobody else but you</i>

980
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,510
<i>We've turned into'</i>

981
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,430
<i>A true-blue duo</i>

982
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:32,642
<i>Hard times, we've had a few'</i>

983
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,894
<i>Like we're thrown in the drink'</i>

984
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,272
<i>Like we're tossed out of town'</i>

985
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,774
<i>But when I start to sink'</i>

986
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:42,819
<i>Hey, I'd rather go down</i>

987
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,904
<i>With nobody else</i>

988
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:50,452
<i>But Y-O-U</i>

989
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,412
Aw, Dad!

990
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,753
Anyway, I figure she's never
gonna want to talk to me again,

991
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:01,880
much less go out with me.

992
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,924
- What a dumb lie, huh?
- What do you know?

993
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,802
My Maxie... in love.

994
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,347
Gosh, you're really growin' up.

995
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,851
It happened so fast...
I guess I sort of missed it.

996
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:19,272
Well, I think the only thing
for us to do now

997
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:21,941
is to get you up onstage
with this Powerline feller.

998
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:25,195
Uh, how are we gonna do that?

999
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,490
- Well, you just leave that up to me.
- No, Dad, really,

1000
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,909
I-I think we should just,
you know, forget it.

1001
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:34,829
Now how come you always think I'm gonna
lead you into some sort of calamity?

1002
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,456
Uh, uh, Dad? Dad?

1003
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,125
- What's wrong now?
- Look!

1004
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,755
Ayuk! A waterfall.

1005
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:45,673
Waterfall!

1006
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:57,685
Dad!

1007
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,187
Max!

1008
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,454
Grab ahold, Max!

1009
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,586
No!

1010
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:25,588
No! Ah!

1011
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,594
Whoa!

1012
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:41,229
Aaaaaaaaaah!

1013
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:45,984
Dad!

1014
01:05:58,246 --> 01:05:59,456
Aaaaaaah!

1015
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:03,209
Ten o'clock, two o'clock,
quarter to three. <i>Tour jeté.</i>

1016
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,878
<i>Twist.
I'm a little teapot</i>

1017
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:05,920
Let her fly!

1018
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,263
Huh?

1019
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,474
Aaah! Aah! Aah!

1020
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,452
The perfect cast.

1021
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,472
Boy, this has been one crazy vacation.

1022
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,474
And it's not over yet!

1023
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:19,953
Dad.

1024
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,914
Oof. We made it!

1025
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:25,208
Come on, Max.
Let's get you onstage.

1026
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,960
Uh, maybe this isn't such a good idea.

1027
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,754
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1028
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:31,548
Oh, then again...

1029
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:34,175
Dad? Dad!

1030
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:37,470
Hey <i>yeah</i>

1031
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,561
<i>I got myself a notion</i>

1032
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:49,274
<i>One I know that you'll understand</i>

1033
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:52,318
<i>We set the world in motion'</i>

1034
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,864
<i>By reaching out for each other's hand</i>

1035
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,825
<i>Dad?
- Maybe we'll discover</i>

1036
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,494
<i>What we should have known all along</i>

1037
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:04,289
- What are you doin' here? Hey!
<i>- Yeah</i>

1038
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:07,000
<i>- One way or another</i>
- Max? Max?

1039
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,335
<i>Together's where we both belong</i>

1040
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:13,631
<i>If we listen to each other's heart'</i>

1041
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,551
<i>We'll find we're never too far apart</i>

1042
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:20,388
<i>And maybe love is the reason why</i>

1043
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:22,640
<i>For the first time ever'</i>

1044
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,143
<i>We're seein' it 1-2-1'</i>

1045
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:27,103
That Goof kid ain't there.

1046
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,064
Don't worry, he'll be there.

1047
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,901
Seein' <i>it</i> 1-2-1

1048
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,195
<i>Seein' it 1-2-1'</i>

1049
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:38,448
Excuse me. Uh...

1050
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,950
<i>Seein' it 1-2-1'</i>

1051
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,369
<i>- I think we're seein' it</i>
- Max?

1052
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,538
Yeow-ee! Yeow-ee!

1053
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:52,045
Hey, Dad. Dad!

1054
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,755
Do the perfect cast!

1055
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,847
<i>If you're ever lonely</i>

1056
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:06,059
<i>Stop, you don't have to be</i>

1057
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:09,020
Whoa! Whoaaa!

1058
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:11,689
<i>After all, it's only a beat away</i>

1059
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,400
<i>From you to me</i>

1060
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:17,612
<i>- Take a look inside to see
- Yeah</i>

1061
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:21,866
<i>If we listen to each other's heart'</i>

1062
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,412
Yeah! Max is on the tube!
That's Max. I know him...

1063
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,873
<i>And maybe love is the reason why</i>

1064
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:32,001
<i>For the first time ever
We're seein' it 1-2-1</i>

1065
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,337
He did it!

1066
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,215
<i>Seein' it 1-2-1'</i>

1067
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,467
<i>Seein' it 1-2-1, baby'</i>

1068
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:45,807
- <i>For the first time
- For the first time</i>

1069
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:50,937
<i>- Seein' it, seein' it, baby</i>
- Yeah!

1070
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,773
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1071
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,818
<i>For the first time ever
Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1072
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:58,277
Come <i>on, baby</i>

1073
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:01,906
<i>- 1-2-1
- 1-2-1</i>

1074
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:05,702
<i>U-z-fl</i>

1075
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:09,539
<i>Yeah 1-2-1'</i>

1076
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,095
You're doin' the right thing, son.

1077
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,638
Yeah, I know.

1078
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,558
But she'll probably
never talk to me again.

1079
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,560
Well, if she doesn't...

1080
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,438
maybe she's just not the one for you.

1081
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,358
That's what I'm afraid of.

1082
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:00,798
Ah, hi! Remember me?

1083
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:03,176
<i>Daddy!</i>

1084
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,220
Max, I saw you on TV.

1085
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:07,430
You were great!

1086
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:10,558
Yeah? I mean, no, no.

1087
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,310
I mean, uh...

1088
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:16,522
Roxanne, I lied to you.
I don't even know Powerline.

1089
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,776
What are you talking about?
A billion people saw you dance with him.

1090
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,444
Yeah, well...

1091
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,490
I never met him before...
the concert, that is.

1092
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,494
You mean that story
about Powerline and your dad...

1093
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:33,706
Why would you make up something like that?

1094
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:34,916
I don't know.

1095
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:38,044
I guess I just...
wanted you to like me.

1096
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,172
I already liked you, Max.

1097
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,927
From the very first time
I heard you laugh.

1098
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:47,512
"Ayuk."

1099
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:51,390
So, you wanna do something tonight?

1100
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:54,185
Definitely! Oh! Oh, no, I can't. I can't.

1101
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:55,436
What?

1102
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:58,356
Well, I'm kinda doin'
somethin' with my dad.

1103
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,149
Honest!

1104
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,902
- How 'bout tomorrow?
- Deal.

1105
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,325
Ayuk! Ha-ha-ha-ha-yuk!

1106
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:27,844
Yeow-hoo-hoo-hooee!

1107
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:40,648
Roxanne, I'd like you to meet my dad.

1108
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:43,442
<i>Enchanté, mademoiselle.</i>

1109
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,345
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1110
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,686
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1111
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:27,862
<i>I got myself a notion'</i>

1112
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:31,449
<i>And one I know that you'll understand</i>

1113
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:35,119
<i>We'll set the world in motion'</i>

1114
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:38,956
<i>By reaching out for each other's hand</i>

1115
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:40,917
<i>Maybe we'll discover</i>

1116
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:44,337
<i>What we should have known all along</i>

1117
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,297
<i>Yeah'</i>

1118
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:51,260
<i>One way or another
Together's where we both belong</i>

1119
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:55,514
<i>If we listen to each other's heart'</i>

1120
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:58,643
<i>We'll find we're never too far apart</i>

1121
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:02,647
<i>And maybe love is the reason why</i>

1122
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:07,944
<i>For the first time ever
We're seein' it 1-2-1</i>

1123
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:25,002
<i>If a wall should come between us'</i>

1124
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:28,631
<i>Too high to climb
Too hard to break through</i>

1125
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:32,343
<i>I know that love will lead us'</i>

1126
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:36,180
<i>And find a way to bring me to you</i>

1127
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,224
<i>So don't be in a hurry</i>

1128
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:41,519
<i>Think before you count us out</i>

1129
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:45,523
<i>Oh, you don't have to worry</i>

1130
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:50,361
<i>- I will never let you down
- Nothin's gonna stop us now</i>

1131
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:54,490
<i>If we listen to each other's heart'</i>

1132
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:57,702
<i>We'll find we're never too far apart</i>

1133
01:14:57,868 --> 01:15:01,789

<i>For the first time ever
We're seein' it 1-2-1</i>

<i>Wes, we're seein' it 1-2-1'</i>

<i>I guess we're seein' it 1-2-1, yeah'</i>

1141
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,440
<i>U-z-fl</i>

1142
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:45,249
<i>If you're ever lonely, stop</i>

1143
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,543
<i>You don't have to be'</i>

1144
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:54,216
<i>After all it's only
A beat away from you to me</i>

1145
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:58,637
<i>Fake a look inside to see, yeah'</i>

1146
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:02,767
<i>If we listen to each other's heart'</i>
