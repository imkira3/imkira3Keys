1
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,927
Ghost Two, this is Echo One.
Ghost Two, this is Echo One.

2
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,132
ETA, four minutes. Repeat, four minutes.

3
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,300
Intel confirmed. Nine hostiles, three marines.

4
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,396
Ghost Two, you are not to engage.
Alpha team is on its way.

5
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:03,462
No time.

6
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,701
- You guys ready to go home?
- Yeah.

7
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:30,724
- How do we get around them?
- We don't.

8
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:36,095
We go through 'em.

9
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:50,241
Ten hut! Look sharp, Marine.

10
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:53,675
As you were, gentlemen.

11
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:56,545
Triton.

12
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,417
Sir?

13
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,514
Outside. Ten minutes.

14
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:03,091
Yes, sir.

15
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:17,538
We've approached this from every angle.
The judge advocate's done hearing your case.

16
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:22,409
- What about an appeal?
- They're not accepting more appeals.

17
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,472
Bottom line is, you disobeyed a direct order.

18
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:30,484
You're being discharged.

19
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:37,953
You served your unit, your corps
and your country with honor, son.

20
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,053
Walk away with dignity.

21
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,896
Colonel,

22
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:47,129
I'm a marine.

23
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:52,340
One of the best. Remember that.

24
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:57,211
On behalf of a grateful nation
and the United States Marine Corps,

25
00:04:57,281 --> 00:05:00,182
I thank you for your loyal service.

26
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:55,364
Thank you.

27
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:05,906
You're home.

28
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,875
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

29
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:36,105
Yeah. I just...

30
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:39,674
I can't believe you're here.

31
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,987
You know, the hardest thing

32
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:58,000
about you leaving was not knowing.

33
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:02,135
You know?

34
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:07,000
Not knowing where you were,
not knowing if you're coming home,

35
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:11,776
not knowing if I'm gonna get that phone call
saying that you wouldn't be.

36
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,749
You married a marine, Kate.

37
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,354
I know it's not gonna be easy for you, John.

38
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:20,913
We'll figure it out together.

39
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,126
I'm home now, and I'm not going anywhere.

40
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,720
Good.

41
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:34,033
And speaking of that, are you sure
about starting this job tomorrow?

42
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:37,005
I think there's so many other things
you could be doing.

43
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:40,271
If I sat around here all day, I'd go insane.

44
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:44,076
I just want you to be happy, John.

45
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:47,642
I am happy.

46
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,016
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

47
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:51,987
To make me happy.

48
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,929
- I'll be right back.
- You got it, man.

49
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:11,304
- What?
- You got it, man.

50
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,037
You know, Scarface. Come on.

51
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:18,512
- Do it again.
- OK. You got it, man.

52
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:21,380
Wow. That's horrible.

53
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,148
- How you doing?
- Fine, sir.

54
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,433
Excuse me.

55
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:56,276
Everybody, down.

56
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,107
Everybody, on the ground now!

57
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,916
Ladies and gentlemen,
keep your heads down and your mouths shut.

58
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:07,183
I don't wanna see any eye contact.

59
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:10,454
I have severe intimacy issues and a gun,

60
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,724
so do yourselves a favor and don't look up.

61
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:20,226
What I want is on the other side of this door.

62
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:23,101
But that's gonna be tricky because...

63
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:25,300
it's bulletproof.

64
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,936
Here's how we're gonna do it.
Hi. Can I borrow you for a second?

65
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,614
- How you doing in there, sport?
- Oh, God, please!

66
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:37,619
Don't look at him. He can't help you.

67
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:39,814
Please! I have children!

68
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,620
I don't think he cares.

69
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:44,853
Please!

70
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:05,304
Fill it.

71
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:14,714
Get down.

72
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,401
Thank you.

73
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,801
Rome.

74
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:41,211
You gotta hit me. It's gotta look real.

75
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,352
For the cops.

76
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,665
That's real.

77
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:01,028
Well, the cops are coming.

78
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:04,562
I'd love to stay and chat, but I can't.

79
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,870
I apologize for that little outburst of anger.

80
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:11,311
That's really more for dramatic purposes
than anything else.

81
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:15,784
I hope that what I've done here today hasn't
forced you to have a negative opinion of me

82
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:21,415
or how you think I feel about the great state
of South Carolina, because I love it here.

83
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,186
I do.

84
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,524
I love the people.

85
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,290
Enjoy the rest of your day.

86
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:26,653
What? Too much?

87
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,171
OK.

88
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,210
We know how they got in here.

89
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:59,221
Once they're in,
they don't bother with any small stuff.

90
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:03,783
They just go right for the vault
with 12 million in diamonds in it -

91
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,762
the same diamonds that were delivered
just 24 hours ago.

92
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:10,265
What are the odds of that?

93
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:15,293
How did our guys know
they were gonna get so lucky today?

94
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:20,566
We could ask our friend on the floor
over there. I bet he knows.

95
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:39,795
I don't care.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

96
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:42,627
Really? See if you can understand this.

97
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:06,749
Is this what you do all day?

98
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,421
I had a Game Boy, but they took it.

99
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:22,203
Come on, man. This is a greatjob.

100
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:25,230
Good benefits, great money.

101
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:28,368
A couple, two, three years,
they move you to management.

102
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:33,712
- How long have you been working here?
- Nine years.

103
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:38,910
How come you're not in management?

104
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,187
Security.

105
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:50,261
We'll be right there.
Psycho ex-boyfriend on 12.

106
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,903
Rick, have you lost your mind?
This is my job.

107
00:15:56,973 --> 00:16:01,069
Really? It doesn't look like a whorehouse.
Where's all the other whores?

108
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:05,581
Where's your pimp? You were with him.
That's why you didn't answer your phone.

109
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:07,741
Sir, could you please come with us?

110
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:09,978
Don't mess with me, pork chop.

111
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,021
You're causing a scene.

112
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:15,990
This is a scene? Wait till I tell Daddy
about the little whore he raised!

113
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,790
- Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to come...
- Ask me what?

114
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:23,230
Take a seat, flattop. I'll get to you in a second.

115
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:25,961
Now, listen to me...
Get your hands off me!

116
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,303
Why are you so angry?

117
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:36,846
You got the Drake.

118
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,904
Dude, let me call you back later.

119
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:44,443
Because I am trapped in an elevator
with a couple ofjackasses, that's why.

120
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:53,057
We kindly ask you to leave the premises, sir.

121
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:56,832
Thanks.

122
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,105
Seriously, just spitballing here.
You know, tell me if I'm close.

123
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:08,371
Right out of high school,
straight into the military,

124
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,345
realized you'd never be
all you thought you could be

125
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:14,906
and that's how you ended up as a rent-a-cop.

126
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:16,918
Tell me I'm wrong.

127
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:21,417
Whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

128
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:24,722
- The genie just tried to hit me!
- He shouldn't have done that.

129
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:28,025
You shouldn't have done that.
But he missed, and you're fine.

130
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:33,228
We deal with people like this every day
and sometimes you just gotta let things go.

131
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:37,433
Yeah? Well, you better
tell your boyfriend to back off.

132
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:42,202
Unfortunately for the genie,
this is not one of those times.

133
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,365
It's on now.

134
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:15,378
You really messed up. Somewhere, somehow,
somebody just got all this on video.

135
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:20,007
By the time you go to sleep tonight,
I'm gonna own this building.

136
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,948
And tomorrow...

137
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,486
don't be late,

138
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:26,522
'cause when you clock in,

139
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:28,750
you're fired!

140
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,600
Johnny.

141
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:58,618
A toast - to your first and last day on the job.

142
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:02,118
Yeah. About that...

143
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,591
Dude, I told you. Don't worry about it.

144
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:07,323
It's not the first time I've been suspended.

145
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,388
That's not it.

146
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:13,526
John, you'll find anotherjob.
You got all that training.

147
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:19,098
Training. Covert reconnaissance.
Close-quarter hand-to-hand combat.

148
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:23,077
Demolition. Not a high call in the workplace
for skills like that, Joe.

149
00:19:23,146 --> 00:19:27,378
OK, but you're a smart guy.
You can do whatever you want.

150
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:33,350
You don't get it. It's not about work.
It's not about ajob.

151
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,950
Being a marine meant everything to me.

152
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:42,125
Now I go and get fired
from some bullshit security job.

153
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,993
Sorry.

154
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:49,297
I don't know what to do.

155
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:52,705
Look.

156
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:57,075
I'm not gonna try and pretend
I know what you're going through,

157
00:19:57,146 --> 00:19:59,307
'cause I don't.

158
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:03,443
And your time as a marine,

159
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,511
yeah, it's over, and that sucks, man.

160
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,552
But your life's not over.

161
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:16,724
I mean, it's changing,
but you've got to learn to change with it.

162
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:22,934
Sometimes... sometimes it's good
to just take a step back

163
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:24,905
and see what you still have.

164
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:31,539
You know,

165
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:34,014
I think I'm gonna go home and see my wife.

166
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,551
Yeah. She's hot.

167
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:49,190
What happened today?

168
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:57,097
We made a lot of money.

169
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:01,074
In the vault. With the kid.

170
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:06,072
That kid showed that
he couldn't keep his mouth shut.

171
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:09,482
And Morgan? Blowing up that cop car?

172
00:21:09,552 --> 00:21:11,850
He went a little overboard.

173
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:14,219
But in all fairness to Morgan,

174
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:18,021
I was firing an automatic weapon
at those cops.

175
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:21,655
Dead cops, all those witnesses...

176
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:24,291
Doesn't that pose a potential problem for us?

177
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,699
So does a prison term.

178
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,501
Bottom line is, we got away clean.

179
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:37,343
What's the matter, Angela?

180
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:39,745
Don't you trust me anymore?

181
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:48,783
Look at me.

182
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:54,423
That kid knew my name.

183
00:21:54,497 --> 00:21:57,091
That's dangerous for all of us.

184
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:04,395
Baby, is there anything in these eyes
that makes you think I could ever hurt you?

185
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:20,388
- What?
- Forget what you did to our guy in the vault.

186
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:24,017
You killed two cops today
and that's a problem.

187
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,756
- Don't start with me.
- You arrogant bastard. You've lost control.

188
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,560
That's where you're wrong, my friend.

189
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,897
You see,

190
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:38,764
- I've gained control.
- Is that right?

191
00:22:38,841 --> 00:22:41,173
You bet your ass that's right.

192
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:44,907
What's the matter with you, Rome?
Have you lost your mind?

193
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:49,645
- Have you forgotten who you're talking to?
- I know exactly who I'm talking to.

194
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:53,052
You see, I have the diamonds,
therefore I have the power.

195
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,455
You have no idea the level of hell
I can bring down on you.

196
00:22:56,525 --> 00:23:00,086
Yeah, but you won't.
Not if you want to see these diamonds.

197
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:04,690
Tomorrow. Noon.
I get my diamonds, you get your money.

198
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:20,839
Listen.

199
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:25,210
About what happened at work today...

200
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:27,381
I'm not telling anybody.

201
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:29,447
Cool.

202
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:44,267
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

203
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,104
- How was work?
- Fine.

204
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,666
Well?

205
00:23:48,744 --> 00:23:51,042
What? What happened?

206
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:54,375
- Talk to me.
- Nothing.

207
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:57,215
Stuff.

208
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:59,618
They're hired to protect us.

209
00:24:00,056 --> 00:24:02,149
But who will protect us from them?

210
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:06,160
Security guards out of control, tonight at 11.

211
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:09,895
Stuff. Like you throwing
a guy out of a window.

212
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,600
Yeah.

213
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:22,071
I thought my days of worrying about you
were over. What happened?

214
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,535
This isn't me.

215
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:26,877
You jumped into work
the minute you got back.

216
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:31,886
Kate, what was I supposed to do?
Come home, sit around?

217
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:35,412
- That's not me. I can't do that.
- I know you can't.

218
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,324
- What if we just took off?
- What?

219
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,864
Yeah. Just left.

220
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:47,062
Gone. Do something crazy. We'll get up
in the morning, we'll go somewhere.

221
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:49,331
- Where?
- I don't know where. Anywhere.

222
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:54,433
It doesn't matter. That's not the point.
I just... I've been thinking a lot about it.

223
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,671
- You have?
- Yeah.

224
00:24:58,347 --> 00:25:00,941
What do you think? Just me and you.

225
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:03,349
I really wanna do this.

226
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,311
Come on. Say yes.

227
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,817
Say yes. John, say yes.

228
00:25:11,894 --> 00:25:14,294
- Come on!
- OK, OK, yes, yes.

229
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:34,639
Hey, man, you're Lincoln Kennedy.
What are you doing here?

230
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:39,484
- I don't know what you're talking about, man.
- Come on, 72, I know it's you.

231
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:42,854
Husky Hall of Fame,
three consecutive Pro Bowls.

232
00:25:42,925 --> 00:25:45,894
Man, you even started in a Super Bowl.

233
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,895
You didn't win,

234
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,625
but you started.

235
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:54,430
Come on, man. I know it's you.

236
00:26:03,446 --> 00:26:05,437
Morgan.

237
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:09,083
Thanks, L.K.

238
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:13,714
Let's take a walk.

239
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,353
- Rock candy?
- Man, you know I hate rock candy.

240
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:21,021
Oh, that's right, because of that one time.

241
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:25,830
Yeah.

242
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:29,359
Let's walk it off. How'd you like
that Benz I hooked you up with?

243
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:34,432
Liked it? Shit. 24-valve V-8,
4MATIC all-wheel drive.

244
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,946
- What's not to like?
- If you liked that, you're gonna love this.

245
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,607
- What's it gonna be, a Mustang?
- Nah.

246
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,844
- A Jag?
- Better.

247
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:46,581
- Come on, man, tell me. What is it?
- Right there.

248
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:53,693
- Man, that's a minivan.
- Rome said inconspicuous.

249
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:56,731
Yeah, but how you gonna send a brother out
in a minivan?

250
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,700
Man, I'm a criminal, not a soccer mom.

251
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:05,229
Come on, big guy. CD, DVD. If you want, I'll
even have Johnny throw some spinners on it.

252
00:27:05,307 --> 00:27:07,138
- Fuck you!
- Or not.

253
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,340
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

254
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:13,813
You see, I am a black man.

255
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:19,182
- Yeah, I got that.
- OK. And that is a minivan.

256
00:27:19,622 --> 00:27:21,283
Right.

257
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:23,757
Black men don't drive minivans, Frank.

258
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:25,760
They do now.

259
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:30,631
Morgan, the five of you
are never gonna fit in one of those.

260
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,591
Take the van. Nobody pays attention.

261
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:35,762
You guys can just disappear.

262
00:27:36,305 --> 00:27:38,637
What do you say?

263
00:27:42,545 --> 00:27:45,810
Keys are in it. Knock yourself out.

264
00:28:23,652 --> 00:28:25,620
Mount Cedar.

265
00:28:25,688 --> 00:28:27,553
I used to go to camp there.

266
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:32,318
God, I haven't thought about that
in a long time.

267
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:35,827
But the mountains are hours away.

268
00:28:35,898 --> 00:28:38,765
Are you sure you don't wanna
just stop at the beach?

269
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:41,894
I think I've seen enough sand.

270
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:46,397
Besides, you're not the only one
with childhood memories of the mountains.

271
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,875
You never told me
that you went to Mount Cedar.

272
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:51,845
It wasn't Mount Cedar. Further up.

273
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,574
So, are you gonna tell me where?

274
00:28:56,652 --> 00:29:00,315
It was just a place that my dad
used to take us when we were kids.

275
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:02,823
What did you guys do up there? Was it fun?

276
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:05,223
It was all right.

277
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:08,229
- Dad liked it.
- Why?

278
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,155
I guess it's 'cause he knew
it was far enough away

279
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:14,293
where nobody could hear
me and my brothers scream.

280
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:18,802
We gotta get some gas.

281
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,252
- You want anything?
- A Diet Coke.

282
00:29:35,324 --> 00:29:36,951
OK.

283
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,663
- Nice butt.
- What?

284
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:35,179
Oh, man.

285
00:31:05,347 --> 00:31:07,474
How you doing?

286
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:15,012
Cadillac man, huh?

287
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:17,553
Yeah.

288
00:31:19,762 --> 00:31:22,526
What happens there, stays there.

289
00:31:22,598 --> 00:31:24,691
What?

290
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:28,398
The Vegas sticker.

291
00:31:32,908 --> 00:31:35,706
Oh, yeah. It's my brother's car.

292
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:40,943
He lives in Vegas.

293
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:43,109
You visit him much?

294
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:45,585
- Couple of times a year.
- Me too.

295
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:49,112
My mom lives there.
I just love it there, you know?

296
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,654
Especially downtown.

297
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:54,855
You ever go to the Olympus?

298
00:31:55,297 --> 00:31:58,528
Not since they tore it down last year.

299
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:00,760
Oh, man.

300
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,233
Don't move.

301
00:32:34,236 --> 00:32:35,794
Great.

302
00:32:38,407 --> 00:32:40,170
Take the truck!

303
00:32:45,781 --> 00:32:48,249
Come here! Bring her! Come here!

304
00:32:49,685 --> 00:32:52,119
- Damn!
- John!

305
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:57,253
- Shut up!
- John!

306
00:32:58,026 --> 00:33:01,723
- Get off of me! John!
- Where the hell did she come from?

307
00:33:01,797 --> 00:33:05,995
- Do we kill her?
- No. We might need a hostage.

308
00:33:11,373 --> 00:33:13,341
Get up!

309
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,535
John!

310
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:29,020
Morgan! Get in the truck.

311
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,291
Come out here.

312
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:44,229
Come on. Hang in there.

313
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:52,065
Keep pressure on that.
I'm gonna call for help.

314
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:18,289
Highway patrol, this is John Triton.
You have officers down at Manze's Gas.

315
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:23,566
Multiple assailants. Four men, one woman,
headed southbound in a black Navigator.

316
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:26,005
They have a hostage. It's my wife.

317
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:52,600
Kate Triton.

318
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:54,761
Married to John Triton.

319
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:57,236
Sergeant John Triton.

320
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:59,136
She married a marine.

321
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:01,937
What'd you marry him for? Benefits?

322
00:36:06,014 --> 00:36:09,211
Settle down. Settle down.

323
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:18,158
You gotta be kidding me.

324
00:36:19,995 --> 00:36:22,190
Cops.

325
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:25,458
That ain't the cops.

326
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,263
I hate cops.

327
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,039
And rock candy.

328
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,007
- Shoot him.
- No!

329
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:40,296
- Would somebody shoot this guy?
- What does it look like we're doing?

330
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,275
Missing.

331
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,955
Hey, slow down!

332
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:12,401
Hey!

333
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:25,080
Whoa!

334
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:06,292
No, no, no, no!

335
00:39:19,074 --> 00:39:21,975
This guy's like the Terminator.

336
00:40:36,084 --> 00:40:38,382
You murdering sons of bitches!

337
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:40,512
Shut her up and get her out of here.

338
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:43,557
You murderers!

339
00:40:46,227 --> 00:40:50,561
Now, Angie, baby, I know you got a hair
trigger, but I said shut her up, not kill her.

340
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:53,658
We might need an insurance policy.

341
00:40:56,237 --> 00:40:58,797
Get a rope and tie her up.

342
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:12,111
Put your hands together.

343
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:19,089
Front axle's history.
We're not going anywhere in this thing.

344
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,095
Now, you figured that out
all by yourself, huh?

345
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:24,631
Actually, I did, yeah.

346
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:29,466
- But, hey, you know what else I figured out?
- What's that?

347
00:41:29,537 --> 00:41:33,098
That you're a trigger-happy nutjob
who belongs in a cage.

348
00:41:39,214 --> 00:41:42,513
All right. We are monumentally screwed here

349
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:46,782
and the last thing I need is you two bickering
like a couple of little girls.

350
00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:50,018
So as of right now, it's over. Are we clear?

351
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:55,154
Because if we're not, I give you my word,
I will absolutely shoot you myself.

352
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,323
What do we do now?

353
00:41:57,399 --> 00:42:00,095
The way I see it, we got two options.

354
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:02,966
A - we stand here and try to kill each other,

355
00:42:03,038 --> 00:42:05,632
but then no one gets paid
and someone gets dead,

356
00:42:05,707 --> 00:42:10,076
or - B - we get out of the swamp,
make our drop and collect our dough.

357
00:42:10,145 --> 00:42:13,546
And maybe it's just the greed talking,
but I'm sticking with B.

358
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:17,483
Yeah, well, I say we move,
'cause every cop in the state heard that blast.

359
00:42:17,552 --> 00:42:19,986
We'll follow the swamp downstream.

360
00:42:21,022 --> 00:42:23,991
- Through there?
- Yeah, through there.

361
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:29,190
The trees will give us cover from the air.
The swamp will slow down the cops.

362
00:42:29,264 --> 00:42:32,927
- What shall we do with our insurance policy?
- Go to hell.

363
00:42:35,503 --> 00:42:38,199
Angie, why'd you do that?

364
00:42:38,273 --> 00:42:40,673
Now Morgan's gotta carry her.

365
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:44,774
Morgan's got...? Morgan's gotta do what?

366
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:57,716
- Watch out for crocodiles.
- What's the matter with you?

367
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,953
Ain't no crocodiles in South Carolina.

368
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,971
- Detective Van Buren.
- Sir.

369
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:25,577
- What have we got?
- Well, we got one deceased officer here

370
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:29,214
and another found seriously wounded there.

371
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:32,286
The guy who called in?

372
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,124
Is a John Triton. He's an ex-marine.

373
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,096
He's for real.

374
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:42,466
His description of the perps sounds like
the crew that hit the diamond store yesterday.

375
00:43:43,171 --> 00:43:45,696
- Are the roadblocks up?
- Yes, sir.

376
00:43:45,773 --> 00:43:48,264
Choppers and search teams are on their way.

377
00:43:48,343 --> 00:43:51,870
So, what else do we know about these guys?

378
00:43:51,946 --> 00:43:55,643
- They're sloppy.
- Unit Four, come in.

379
00:43:58,453 --> 00:44:01,422
- Go ahead.
- We got a report of a multiple car accident

380
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:03,684
and shots fired five miles south of you.

381
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:07,489
The highway patrol car from your location
was involved. Check and advise.

382
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,325
I'm en route.

383
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:41,326
Detective Van Buren, Homicide.

384
00:44:41,396 --> 00:44:43,728
I'm gonna assume you're John Triton.

385
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,504
They took my wife.

386
00:44:50,572 --> 00:44:54,599
- That's a matter for law enforcement now.
- Listen.

387
00:44:54,676 --> 00:44:58,806
I've seen them kill three people.
My wife will not be number four.

388
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,644
I can't give you permission to pursue.

389
00:45:01,716 --> 00:45:03,980
I'm not asking for it.

390
00:45:04,052 --> 00:45:06,680
You know, this whole area's tidal.

391
00:45:06,754 --> 00:45:10,850
The way the water level changes, these guys
are going to be impossible to track.

392
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:13,189
- I can handle it.
- Triton.

393
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:17,689
I've seen what these guys can do.

394
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:21,060
You better hurry.

395
00:45:22,036 --> 00:45:27,064
Get the chains out. I want this river dragged.
Are we in the air yet?

396
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:24,895
If you and I are gonna be friends,
you need to learn some manners.

397
00:46:25,433 --> 00:46:27,628
Bitch.

398
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:33,964
- Man, the hell with this!
- You got a problem, brother?

399
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:39,742
My problem is walking through this dirty-ass
swamp with the entire county looking for us

400
00:46:39,814 --> 00:46:43,841
because somebody decided
that killing cops was a good idea.

401
00:46:43,918 --> 00:46:46,682
Genius, that somebody's you.

402
00:46:46,754 --> 00:46:50,713
- You're the one that killed the cops.
- Yeah. Both of 'em.

403
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,295
So now we wanna start
playing the blame game, huh?

404
00:46:55,363 --> 00:46:57,661
Always wanna blame the black man.

405
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,894
Somebody steals a car, the black man did it.

406
00:47:00,968 --> 00:47:03,198
House gets robbed, black man.

407
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:08,573
Cop car gets blown up by an Israeli
single-shot shoulder-fired rocket launcher,

408
00:47:08,643 --> 00:47:10,770
- guess who?
- The black man.

409
00:47:13,381 --> 00:47:15,212
That's right, Vescera.

410
00:47:15,717 --> 00:47:18,811
- The black man!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Morgan!

411
00:47:18,886 --> 00:47:21,286
You are one crazy son of a bitch.

412
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,816
I like that. I do.

413
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:31,196
But no one's gonna get killed here
until I give the go-ahead, and I didn't give it.

414
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:43,306
- What was that?
- The go-ahead.

415
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:55,015
- Why Vescera?
- We might need a crazy son of a bitch.

416
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:04,989
- I thought you said there were no crocodiles.
- Those are alligators.

417
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,692
- You think they're hungry?
- Not anymore.

418
00:48:17,545 --> 00:48:20,844
- What have you got?
- Nothing yet.

419
00:48:25,086 --> 00:48:28,487
There's no way anybody
could have lived through this.

420
00:48:28,556 --> 00:48:31,184
- Keep me informed.
- Yes, sir.

421
00:50:07,688 --> 00:50:09,485
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

422
00:50:09,557 --> 00:50:11,582
- How you doing?
- How am I doing?

423
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:16,221
Not so good, huh? Well, you know
that triple homicide I was just involved in?

424
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:19,892
- The one all over the news?
- Yeah, right. That's the one. I know, bad.

425
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:25,064
Anyways, I think I can now add kidnapping
to my litany of atrocities.

426
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:28,267
I know I can. She's standing there
in front of me right now.

427
00:50:28,342 --> 00:50:31,402
- Why are you telling me all this?
- Why am I telling you this?

428
00:50:31,479 --> 00:50:36,348
Because in the middle of blowing up the gas
station, killing the marine and kidnapping,

429
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:42,219
I had a great idea. In fact, it's such a great idea
that I even came up with a name for it.

430
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,554
It's called "You're Out."

431
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,189
Which basically means you get nothing.

432
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:51,993
No split, no diamonds, no payoff, no nothing.

433
00:50:52,066 --> 00:50:56,366
- We had a plan, Rome.
- I know we had a plan, but plans change.

434
00:50:56,437 --> 00:51:00,965
At least, for one of us, they do.
Now, listen. If you think for one second...

435
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:05,411
- You wouldn't get away with this without me.
- Can you hold on?

436
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,913
Yeah. This is he.

437
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:11,042
I'm calling to let you know
your order's been approved.

438
00:51:11,118 --> 00:51:16,385
Yeah. Now, does that include all the premium
channels and the sports package?

439
00:51:16,457 --> 00:51:18,618
Sure does.

440
00:51:43,951 --> 00:51:46,283
All right. The air show's over.

441
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,948
Let's get the hell outta here.

442
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:53,783
Go on.

443
00:53:01,529 --> 00:53:04,054
That's a creepy-ass snake.

444
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:06,656
Slimy and scaly.

445
00:53:06,734 --> 00:53:09,430
It's terrifying, all these animals and bugs.

446
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:12,666
I hate this, man. I'm not built for this stuff.

447
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,904
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me? Think about it.

448
00:53:16,977 --> 00:53:21,038
How many brothers you see in Deliverance?
The answer is zero.

449
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:24,516
You know why?
Because brothers don't camp.

450
00:53:24,585 --> 00:53:27,986
Why does everything always have
to be racial with you, Morgan?

451
00:53:28,055 --> 00:53:31,582
Why do you feel the need
to confine us to these labels?

452
00:53:31,659 --> 00:53:33,718
Why can't we just be people?

453
00:53:34,662 --> 00:53:37,927
- What do you think, Kate?
- I think you're psychotic.

454
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:44,063
Now, how can you say that?
You don't even know me.

455
00:53:45,106 --> 00:53:47,301
That's very judgmental.

456
00:53:50,211 --> 00:53:52,509
Is she looking at me?

457
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:02,246
I'm gonna be totally honest here.

458
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:06,657
I thought that you and I, you know,
we could've had a future, you know,

459
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:09,127
if it wasn't for...

460
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:20,630
What?

461
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:24,969
You're insane.

462
00:54:28,482 --> 00:54:31,280
Maybe.

463
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:34,378
Good talk.

464
00:54:42,596 --> 00:54:45,087
- Cops.
- Get the truck loaded.

465
00:55:15,196 --> 00:55:17,528
Hold it right there, cop.

466
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:22,869
I'm not a cop.

467
00:55:22,937 --> 00:55:25,633
I'm just looking for some people.

468
00:55:25,706 --> 00:55:28,038
Boy, I will end you.

469
00:55:30,377 --> 00:55:32,675
I told you, I'm not a cop.

470
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:46,116
Wait here. And somebody shut her up.

471
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,961
- What have you got?
- Nothing.

472
00:55:55,035 --> 00:55:56,866
All right.

473
00:55:57,304 --> 00:55:59,238
- Van Buren here.
- Sir, come in.

474
00:55:59,306 --> 00:56:03,868
- What's going on in the south fork?
- Nothing. We're headed for the marina.

475
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:07,004
I want every shack
on that riverbank searched.

476
00:56:07,081 --> 00:56:09,072
- Find them.
- Copy that.

477
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:25,690
What'd you find?

478
00:56:25,766 --> 00:56:29,998
There's a lodge up there.
It's swarming with cops.

479
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,996
What do you want to do now?

480
00:56:33,073 --> 00:56:37,009
We'll let the cops leave
and then we'll cross the river.

481
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:52,254
Take these. Get 'em loaded.
We gotta move.

482
00:57:04,071 --> 00:57:06,767
What the hell are you doing out here, cop?

483
00:57:07,741 --> 00:57:09,766
You guys got it all wrong.

484
00:57:10,945 --> 00:57:13,743
Save your lies, boy.

485
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:20,252
If I was a cop, I'd have a badge, a gun.

486
00:57:20,788 --> 00:57:23,586
I don't. I'm just out here trying...

487
00:57:29,129 --> 00:57:31,495
Just trying to what?

488
00:57:32,299 --> 00:57:36,258
I got choppers buzzing around here,
and I got you sneaking up our asses,

489
00:57:36,337 --> 00:57:38,396
and you're not a cop?

490
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:43,838
Right.

491
00:57:43,911 --> 00:57:46,573
You're right. I'm a cop.

492
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,206
They're tracking my GPS right now.

493
00:57:50,284 --> 00:57:53,378
GPS? I told you to search him!

494
00:57:53,454 --> 00:57:56,082
- I did!
- Find it!

495
00:57:56,857 --> 00:57:59,325
Where's the goddamn bug, cop?

496
00:59:54,942 --> 00:59:59,003
- What are you doing, man?
- No contact points, no alarm.

497
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:01,639
It's a freaking shack.

498
01:00:04,118 --> 01:00:05,949
Get in there.

499
01:00:16,563 --> 01:00:18,827
Something die in here?

500
01:00:18,899 --> 01:00:21,834
I don't know, but it smells like baked ass.

501
01:00:24,438 --> 01:00:28,067
Morgan, see if you can go find a generator.

502
01:00:28,142 --> 01:00:30,872
- Why me?
- Why not?

503
01:00:30,944 --> 01:00:33,913
What if there's some guy
with a hockey mask and a hatchet?

504
01:00:33,981 --> 01:00:38,350
Or a group of country ass-crackers
craving some man love?

505
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,179
Lt'll be fun, like summer camp.

506
01:00:41,255 --> 01:00:44,349
Yeah, but brothers don't camp.

507
01:00:44,424 --> 01:00:47,291
Yeah, well, actually I did go to camp once.

508
01:00:47,361 --> 01:00:49,591
I was 13 years old.

509
01:00:51,632 --> 01:00:54,658
And there was this camp counselor.
Cool honky.

510
01:00:55,669 --> 01:00:57,193
Timothy.

511
01:00:58,105 --> 01:00:59,538
Tim.

512
01:01:00,707 --> 01:01:05,303
Or, as he liked to be called, Johnny Whiplash.

513
01:01:08,015 --> 01:01:13,510
Well, tell us, Morgan.
What did this Johnny Whiplash have to offer?

514
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:18,057
Well, first he offered friendship.

515
01:01:20,327 --> 01:01:22,192
Then some rock candy.

516
01:01:25,632 --> 01:01:29,830
Then he offered me something
that I never should have accepted.

517
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,475
Wow.

518
01:01:39,246 --> 01:01:41,612
Well, good luck with all that.

519
01:01:41,682 --> 01:01:43,980
Now go find the generator.

520
01:02:02,202 --> 01:02:04,534
What we talked about...

521
01:02:05,739 --> 01:02:08,299
ain't leaving this room, right?

522
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:09,706
No. No.

523
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:14,572
Now, go find the goddamn generator.

524
01:03:32,459 --> 01:03:33,790
Cool.

525
01:04:59,613 --> 01:05:01,774
- Hello.
- Hey. It's me.

526
01:05:02,215 --> 01:05:05,082
- Hold on. Frank.
- What?

527
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:07,313
It's Rome.

528
01:05:12,259 --> 01:05:15,023
- So, how's my Cadillac?
- Plan A's screwed.

529
01:05:15,095 --> 01:05:18,394
- No shit. You're all over the news.
- We're switching to plan B.

530
01:05:18,465 --> 01:05:21,764
- Well, what the hell is plan B?
- I don't know what plan B is.

531
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:24,827
- I'm making this up as I go.
- Great.

532
01:05:24,905 --> 01:05:27,840
- You know Rita's down by the marina?
- Yeah.

533
01:05:27,908 --> 01:05:32,208
- I want you to leave a car there for me.
- I need some time. Give me till tomorrow.

534
01:05:32,279 --> 01:05:36,909
No, as soon as you can.
Looks like we're going to Phoenix.

535
01:05:42,556 --> 01:05:44,888
What are you looking at?

536
01:05:58,638 --> 01:06:00,629
Why so sad?

537
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,505
Don't like your new friends?

538
01:06:03,577 --> 01:06:06,045
You're pathetic.

539
01:06:06,112 --> 01:06:07,807
How so?

540
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:16,352
You're like his little puppet.

541
01:06:24,464 --> 01:06:26,523
So, what's the plan?

542
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,795
Where are we going?

543
01:06:28,869 --> 01:06:31,133
What, no faith?

544
01:06:31,204 --> 01:06:35,834
I have faith.
I just need to know if I'm still in the loop.

545
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:41,008
There's this guy in Phoenix.

546
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:44,573
I figure since we did 100% of the work,

547
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:46,949
why not keep 100%% of the diamonds?

548
01:06:48,522 --> 01:06:52,014
- Can he move 'em?
- That he can, my friend.

549
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,458
That he can.

550
01:06:57,797 --> 01:07:00,231
You grew up on the water, right? Louisiana?

551
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,632
- Miami.
- Yeah, whatever.

552
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:06,996
See if you can go get
that boat started out there.

553
01:07:09,042 --> 01:07:11,704
Hey, Bennett.

554
01:07:13,313 --> 01:07:16,305
Check on Morgan. See what he's up to.

555
01:07:36,403 --> 01:07:38,394
Morgan.

556
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:26,148
- How many are left?
- There's two upstairs.

557
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,116
- You wait here.
- I'm not waiting anywhere.

558
01:08:33,627 --> 01:08:35,891
You don't know what you're walking into.

559
01:08:35,962 --> 01:08:39,693
It's a matter of time before they realize
these two aren't coming back.

560
01:08:39,766 --> 01:08:42,735
I gotta do something and I gotta do it now.

561
01:08:46,006 --> 01:08:48,304
OK.

562
01:09:26,379 --> 01:09:27,744
Playtime's over.

563
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:33,484
- There's a crazy son of a bitch.
- Where is she?

564
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:38,349
This just gets better and better.

565
01:09:38,858 --> 01:09:41,156
Put it down.

566
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:44,691
All right.

567
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:50,826
Easy, big guy.
He's still got something I need.

568
01:09:50,904 --> 01:09:53,737
I don't care what you do to him.
I just want my wife.

569
01:09:53,807 --> 01:09:56,241
He's not gonna do anything to me.

570
01:09:56,309 --> 01:09:59,676
Not until he finds out
what happened to those stolen diamonds.

571
01:09:59,746 --> 01:10:01,805
'Cause that's what he's after.

572
01:10:02,515 --> 01:10:05,484
His cut.

573
01:10:05,552 --> 01:10:08,248
Isn't that right, Officer?

574
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:14,158
Now, why don't you just take a second
and let that sink in there, champ?

575
01:10:18,498 --> 01:10:20,989
Where are they, Rome?

576
01:10:21,067 --> 01:10:23,865
- Where's what?
- Give me my damn diamonds!

577
01:10:23,937 --> 01:10:26,497
Whoa! Calm down, V.B.

578
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:31,707
I know our last deal didn't work out too well,
but I'm willing to make a new one.

579
01:10:31,778 --> 01:10:35,111
You see, I tried to kill this guy twice today

580
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:37,672
and he just won't die.

581
01:10:37,751 --> 01:10:41,619
Maybe I'm having an off day. I don't know.

582
01:10:41,688 --> 01:10:44,384
But if you shoot him right now,

583
01:10:44,858 --> 01:10:47,452
I'm willing to split the diamonds with you.

584
01:10:47,527 --> 01:10:50,189
What do you say?

585
01:11:19,058 --> 01:11:22,027
- There's our ride. Let's go.
- Go where? What happened?

586
01:11:22,095 --> 01:11:25,462
- Her marine showed up, that's what.
- He's still alive?

587
01:12:01,968 --> 01:12:04,630
Let's go.

588
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:15,514
Oh, no. You're not putting me in there.
You're not putting me in there!

589
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:46,677
Out of the water. Get out of the water now!

590
01:12:55,722 --> 01:12:58,816
Turn around.
Put your hands above your head.

591
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:11,229
- Turn around.
- I'm John Triton.

592
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:15,866
Shut up! Down on your knees.
Place your hands behind your head.

593
01:13:15,942 --> 01:13:19,275
- I called you. They have my wife.
- Shut up, boy!

594
01:13:19,712 --> 01:13:25,173
You're under arrest. You have the right
to remain silent. I suggest you use it.

595
01:13:29,656 --> 01:13:31,521
You're dead, boy!

596
01:13:32,058 --> 01:13:33,685
Son of a bitch!

597
01:13:42,602 --> 01:13:45,264
Look at that.

598
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:48,899
You don't mind if I keep this one, do you?

599
01:13:51,778 --> 01:13:54,372
I'm sure we can work something out.

600
01:13:54,447 --> 01:13:56,881
Work something out?

601
01:14:05,425 --> 01:14:09,384
Wait a minute, baby.
I gotta drive. Baby, I can't do this.

602
01:14:09,462 --> 01:14:12,192
Say yes.

603
01:14:12,265 --> 01:14:14,392
Baby, I gotta drive. Yes.

604
01:14:14,467 --> 01:14:15,900
Yes.

605
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:32,651
What's the matter, baby?
Don't you trust me anymore?

606
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:41,292
Unit Four, this is Command. Over.

607
01:14:42,128 --> 01:14:44,688
We gotta get rid of this car.

608
01:14:44,764 --> 01:14:47,062
- Any suggestions?
- Van Buren?

609
01:14:47,133 --> 01:14:49,795
Yeah.

610
01:14:51,437 --> 01:14:53,166
I got one.

611
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:24,668
- Hi.
- Hey, girl.

612
01:15:24,737 --> 01:15:27,706
- Nice truck.
- Wanna go for a ride?

613
01:15:36,749 --> 01:15:40,742
Base to River Unit. We have a positive
identification on your trucker.

614
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,050
Last logged in driving a grey semi.

615
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:48,116
A vehicle matching that description
was just seen five miles north of Rita's Marina

616
01:15:48,194 --> 01:15:50,890
heading southbound on Route 16.

617
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:04,568
- So, what's the plan?
- We'll pick up our clean car

618
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:07,613
and then we're home free.

619
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:54,654
Get that bitch off me.

620
01:17:02,001 --> 01:17:04,469
I don't see the car.

621
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:06,971
Let's check the other line.

622
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:18,077
What the hell was that?

623
01:17:49,982 --> 01:17:51,142
John!

624
01:17:53,486 --> 01:17:54,953
John!

625
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,149
John!

626
01:18:28,754 --> 01:18:30,346
John!

627
01:18:48,874 --> 01:18:50,899
Gotta go, babe!

628
01:21:01,507 --> 01:21:04,340
Say hello to your wife!

629
01:22:28,928 --> 01:22:30,793
Come on. Come on.

630
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:40,668
No, Kate. Come on, come on, come on.

631
01:22:44,276 --> 01:22:46,904
Wake up!

632
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:53,041
Come on.

633
01:22:55,254 --> 01:22:57,245
Come on.

634
01:23:02,161 --> 01:23:04,152
Come on.

635
01:23:08,334 --> 01:23:10,393
Come on. Wake up!

636
01:23:10,469 --> 01:23:12,198
Wake up!

637
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:15,396
That's it. Come on. That's it.

638
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:54,040
We should've gone to the beach.
