3
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:43,927
- Wait what? What's this?
- You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

4
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,148
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

5
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:58,116
- What the hell is this?
- I don't know what the fuck this is.

6
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,074
Hey asshole, P.D. Come on.

7
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:02,165
Hello?

8
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:08,691
What the fuck?!

9
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:10,389
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Get the fuck out!

10
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,051
- Let's go, bitch.
- Come on, let's go.

11
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:23,141
Walk!

12
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,146
Hey, bitch! Handcuff
your boy here.

13
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,452
- Let's go!
- Move it, sunshine.

14
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:32,324
Careful! Careful!

15
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:34,154
Come on!

16
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:38,852
Looks like we're
working overtime tonight, huh?

17
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:40,549
You're not walking
from this, asshole!

18
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:42,595
Wanna fuckin' bet?

19
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,336
That's it! Move out!

20
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:45,859
Hey! It's not worth it.

21
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,776
Let's get the fuck outta here.

22
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:03,224
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

23
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:16,324
That's when the bank
called to tell me

24
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:19,109
I didn't write all those checks.

25
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:21,286
I'm on Social Security.

26
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,984
Yes, ma'am, there's a fraud
ring operating in this area.

27
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:29,381
Well, they must've taken my
new checks outta my mailbox.

28
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,296
Are you writing that down?

29
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:33,950
Yes, ma'am.

30
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:38,303
Out. Of. Your. Mailbox.

31
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:41,001
You should get your checks
sent to a P.O. box

32
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:42,698
or pick 'em up in person.

33
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,919
It isn't easy for me
to get around, officer.

34
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:47,312
I take the bus.

35
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:48,965
- It's "Detective."
- Really?

36
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:51,185
You seem too young.

37
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:53,753
Well, I've aged some
since this conversation.

38
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:55,798
Look,
we've got your information,

39
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,410
here's my card,
don't hesitate to call

40
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,414
if anything
else comes up.

41
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,720
Scout,
where are you going?

42
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:15,470
I'm not at liberty to say.

43
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:18,125
Surely you people know
I can't make a comment

44
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:21,259
on a goddamn investigation
that's ongoing!

45
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,738
Oh, you want a sound bite?

46
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,871
Sure.
How about "Go fuck yourself"?

47
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:27,961
Thank you, Michael.

48
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:29,919
Okay, next.

49
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:32,748
- Drug holdup.
- Oh yeah.

50
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,968
Fuckin' press is having
a field day with that one.

51
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,622
These two stupid
fuckin' coconuts,

52
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:38,276
they go get themselves
ripped off,

53
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,799
upstairs is breathing down
my neck.

54
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,017
I want on the case.

55
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,324
It's handled, kid.

56
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,108
Who?

57
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,675
- Steve Kitchen.
- Kitchen?!

58
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:49,330
Come on, Cap, that guy
couldn't find a clue

59
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:50,984
if you FedEx'ed him one.

60
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,507
He's got 15 years on you,
Michael.

61
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,596
Plus he came up in the rotation,

62
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:57,686
and, correct me if I'm
wrong, you're on a case?

63
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,601
Paper pushing doesn't count.

64
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:01,560
Lookit, that wasn't
some random score...

65
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:03,170
someone knew to hit that van.

66
00:05:03,172 --> 00:05:05,259
That's what we call conjecture,
Michael.

67
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:08,349
Yeah, well, let me on with
Kitchen, I'll find out.

68
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,830
Michael, you haven't exactly
made what I would call

69
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,398
a good case for team player
around here.

70
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,489
I can work this one.

71
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,492
I'm not my dad.

72
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:22,058
Don't diss your old man, son.

73
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,800
Try living in his shadow.

74
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:26,804
Michael.

75
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:32,242
Look, I know you can do the job.

76
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:33,940
I'm the one that
put in for your promotion.

77
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:36,377
But you are low man on
the totem pole here.

78
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,990
You will get your shot.

79
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:46,126
- No.
- No what?

80
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,084
No, I do not want your
assistance on this case.

81
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:50,260
Come on, Kitchen, I can
check some leads for you,

82
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:51,958
- handle some legwork.
- I got this.

83
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,090
I don't need a sous chef
just 'cause O'Brian

84
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:58,094
handed you a toy detective
badge to play with.

85
00:05:58,096 --> 00:05:59,661
- What do you got there?
- We all done here?

86
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:01,271
- What?
- I'm gonna go hit the head,

87
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,403
wring it out.

88
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,665
Let me know if you find it.

89
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,016
Prick.

90
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,764
You're late.

91
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,725
I know, Carmen,
it won't happen again.

92
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:22,728
You got something for me?

93
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,601
I'm a little short this week,
Carmen.

94
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:28,864
David, that is two strikes
in one day.

95
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,910
Carmen, hear me out.

96
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:33,434
Did you catch what
went down last night?

97
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:35,436
Oh, don't make me guess.

98
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,874
The police van holdup.

99
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:40,485
What, you?

100
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:43,531
Yeah. Well, I helped.

101
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,361
I didn't know you had it
in ya, kid.

102
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:50,625
Well, you know, first they
gotta transact the stuff,

103
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:53,193
but then I could catch up
with you, plus interest.

104
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:55,282
Yeah, what's the stuff?

105
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:58,285
- Uh, Psidonader.
- Ha! What?

106
00:06:58,287 --> 00:06:59,939
I don't know,
that's what it said

107
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:01,331
on the side of the barrels.

108
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,463
Spell it.

109
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:06,380
Uh, P-S-E-U...

110
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:08,121
Pseudoephedrine?

111
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:09,514
Yeah, yeah,
that's it, that's it.

112
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,820
That's the shit
they make meth with.

113
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:13,866
You could steal it,
you just can't pronounce it.

114
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,128
Yeah, okay.

115
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,304
So Ray's looking for a buyer.

116
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:20,089
- Ray?
- Yeah, Blaine.

117
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:23,399
Ray Blaine?
Works for Connolly?

118
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:28,141
- What's it worth?
- Ray didn't say.

119
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:29,708
I just know what it makes,

120
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,361
so I figured
it's gotta be worth a lot.

121
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,799
Blaine's too small-time
to move that much product

122
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,714
on his own.

123
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,020
It's Colton's show, he had
Ray put together the team

124
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:39,848
and we just get a cut.

125
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,198
- Did he?
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,288
Tell ya what,
we'll buy it from you,

127
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,770
deal us in, I'll get your debt
forgiven as a finder's fee.

128
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:52,208
I don't know, Carmen.
It's not my call.

129
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,864
Hmm. Well, I'll tell ya what.

130
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:58,563
Here's your options.

131
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:01,217
You and Blaine, you bring
me the goods,

132
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:04,699
I up your cut 20 percent,

133
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:05,744
you get your loan forgiven.
Win-win.

134
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:08,268
If ya don't, well,

135
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,576
what with
our insistence on protocol...

136
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:14,842
it could prove injurious
to our friendship.

137
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,106
My shop tonight.
10 o'clock.

138
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,108
Oh, and David.

139
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,329
Don't be fuckin' late.

140
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,510
Get the fuck outta here.

141
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:34,555
Brandt, DNA results

142
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,122
back from the lab?

143
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:37,558
The DNA on the vault
doesn't match

144
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,168
that on the broken door glass.

145
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,172
Get your fuckin' feet
off my desk.

146
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:45,394
Shit! Asshole.

147
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:49,222
You know, Connolly, you need

148
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:52,138
to stick with that little
bad check case.

149
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,357
Maybe when you're out
of diapers you can tag along.

150
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,359
Kinda hypocritical when
you're wearing Depends.

151
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:58,710
- Fuck you!
- Only if you're on the bottom, you fat fuck.

152
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:00,276
You know,
losing that mouth may actually

153
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:01,887
help you make some friends
around here.

154
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,671
You know what?
I'm good flying solo.

155
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:05,978
Yeah, how's that working out?

156
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,070
Rotten tree, rotten apple.

157
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,255
Fuckin' Connolly.

158
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:27,392
Well?

159
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,742
What you think, Kitchen?

160
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:33,440
He bit.
His shop, ten tonight.

161
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:36,486
Good.
Now get the fuck outta here.

162
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:38,578
Go on, get the fuck outta here.

163
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:43,842
Jesus fuckin' Christ.

164
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,383
Klaus, come.

165
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:30,368
Alright, come on,
we're good.

166
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:35,678
Come on, get in.

167
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,651
You must be Ray.

168
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:55,348
Paris here says you're buying.

169
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,004
Follow me.

170
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:01,704
It's alright man, come on.

171
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,454
Hey, Ray, let me ask you
a question.

172
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,151
Mind telling me
what you're doing

173
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:18,023
stealing another man's property?

174
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,025
We're not stealing it
from Cohen,

175
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:21,417
we're selling it for him.

176
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,768
Wasn't talking about Cohen.

177
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,553
Took it from the cops, man,
what are you talking about?

178
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:29,295
What's Cohen want for it?

179
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:31,819
Half a mil a barrel.

180
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:34,171
Two mil all in.

181
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:53,538
- What's with the plastic?
- Paintin'.

182
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:07,942
Oh, shit!

183
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:15,863
Jesus Christ,
Schlychter,

184
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:19,127
you didn't have to
kill the kid too.

185
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,783
Clean up.

186
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,480
Hurry.

187
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,439
Klaus, come.

188
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:47,460
This is Detective
Steven Kitchen, Cleveland P.D.

189
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:48,548
Leave a message.

190
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,942
Kitchen, Michael Connolly.

191
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:53,076
Call me back, man.

192
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:20,710
Carmen... those things
will kill ya.

193
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:23,803
You gotta
die of something.

194
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:28,588
Nice night.

195
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,332
Yeah,
a lot of stars.

196
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,161
You see up there?

197
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:39,033
That's the Hunter. Orion.

198
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:44,038
And those three bright
stars in perfect alignment,

199
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,693
that's his belt.

200
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:50,915
To the left you have
Canis Major and Canis Minor.

201
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:55,093
So you see,
even up in the cosmos

202
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:57,706
the Hunter has
his faithful dogs.

203
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,101
So that's the Hunter,
and those are his dogs?

204
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:04,493
Yeah.

205
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:10,891
Klaus. Klaus, seek!

206
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,602
No.

207
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:33,176
Klaus! Klaus, come!

208
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:46,971
You're way out of your jurisdiction
here, Detective Kitchen.

209
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:49,538
Call off your fuckin' dog,
and I'll tell you why I'm here.

210
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,453
I know why you're here.

211
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,542
You pissed off the wrong guy.

212
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,947
For crying out loud,
Schlychter, how many corpses

213
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,383
are you gonna make tonight?

214
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:11,647
Is it weighing
on your conscience?

215
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,258
No.

216
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,564
It's weighing on my back.

217
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:19,438
I gotta haul this stiff
back to the lake.

218
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,380
Conductor make you
stay late again?

219
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,817
It was either this or write,
"I will not tap

220
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:53,254
my foot to the music"
on the blackboard 100 times.

221
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:55,213
Did you catch all the bad guys?

222
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,650
Not all of them.

223
00:15:57,652 --> 00:15:59,219
Mmm, good.

224
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:04,657
Then they need to keep you
on the payroll.

225
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:07,442
Aren't the hall's new acoustics
amazing?

226
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:09,270
Yeah tell me in the car.
I'm hungry.

227
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:14,536
Alright, well...
how was it today?

228
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:17,670
Oh, you know, same shit,
different day.

229
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:21,326
Well, Connolly,
from where I stand,

230
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:24,068
in your line of work,
boredom is a good thing.

231
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,809
Well. it's the boredom
I can handle.

232
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:29,814
What, are we not
playing well with others?

233
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:33,860
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

234
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:36,341
Jesus, come on,
let's go feed you.

235
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,822
Alright.

236
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,000
Any idea where we
packed our wedding photos?

237
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:47,308
Ah, I was on remote duty. So...

238
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:53,401
- Hey, look.
- Hmm.

239
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:56,972
- Where should we put it?
- I guess, ah, mothballs.

240
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,458
Here.

241
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:09,028
Make yourself useful.

242
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,597
Closet shelf or storage.

243
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,034
Come on.

244
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,600
Come on, let's go.

245
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:19,908
Aye, me.

246
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,217
Okay.

247
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:28,699
You should put that one out.

248
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,943
You look like him there.

249
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:59,076
Yeah, it's the pot
calling the kettle black.

250
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,643
Don't say that.
You're not like him,

251
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:03,515
and you need to find a way
to forgive him.

252
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,517
Jia, can I just please
watch some TV?

253
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,695
Can you stop trying to fix it?

254
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:14,221
Fine.

255
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:20,140
Yeah. Uh, just maybe one day
you could try to let it go.

256
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,838
You know, for me?

257
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,668
It'd be nice to live with
just one Connolly man.

258
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,891
The dead one sucks up
a lot of oxygen around here.

259
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,937
Yeah.

260
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,636
The storage.

261
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,598
Our patron donor

262
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,862
behind this landmark
concert hall renovation

263
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:49,213
is a third generation
Clevelander

264
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,824
and a self-made shipping magnate

265
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,391
who has made his family's name

266
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:55,349
synonymous with
community service.

267
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,960
His generous donations
over the years has enabled

268
00:18:57,962 --> 00:19:01,834
the Philharmonic not only
to survive but to flourish.

269
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,966
On behalf of
the Philharmonic board,

270
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:06,317
I ask you to join me
in welcoming

271
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,014
three-time Cleveland
Chamber of Commerce

272
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:10,712
Businessman of the Year
Angelo Leonetti.

273
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,676
Thank you, Madam President.

274
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:21,810
Well it seems that our
fair city has headed

275
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:24,248
on an exciting road
to a bright future,

276
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,902
and this magnificently
renovated concert hall

277
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,861
is for all of us,
generations to come.

278
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,819
Frankly, I can't wait to hear

279
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:32,778
these talented musicians
perform in it.

280
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,520
I am grateful to have
been able to contribute.

281
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:38,610
Thank you very much.
Enjoy the festivities.

282
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:43,051
Refreshments are
in the lounge.

283
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:17,170
This is Detective
Steven Kitchen, Cleveland P.D.

284
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:18,215
Leave a message.

285
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,749
Oh, what the fuck?

286
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:32,533
Cars come to us
with the plates pulled.

287
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:35,319
We were about to mash it
when we saw it still had one.

288
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,930
I contacted the DMV, they said
the plates were state-issued,

289
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:39,323
so I called you guys.

290
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,238
Did you check the trunk first?

291
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,630
Yeah, empty.

292
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:43,981
Forensics is on the way.

293
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:48,157
What the fuck
are you doing here, Connolly?

294
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,638
Relax, Brent, I called him.

295
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,771
I brought some coffees.

296
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,555
You hurt my feelings.

297
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:56,340
Asshole can't even show up
on time.

298
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:58,559
Would you two shut up?

299
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:01,736
When was Kitchen last seen?

300
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,303
Don't know.

301
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,000
Day before yesterday.

302
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:07,089
Yeah, he wouldn't
return my calls.

303
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:09,570
So, it looks like you
got a missing drug case

304
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:11,529
and no detective.

305
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,835
Jesus, I can't believe
this guy.

306
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:15,402
He's right, though.

307
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:19,060
I'm swamped,
and nobody else is free.

308
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,326
Come here, Michael.

309
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:30,678
Look, until we know where
Kitchen is,

310
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,811
I want you to loop me in.

311
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:35,509
Do you understand me?

312
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:38,425
I don't want you
disappearing like Kitchen.

313
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:40,514
You got it, Cap.
I'm on it.

314
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,605
Michael, Michael, Michael.

315
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:48,392
Please don't make me
regret this decision.

316
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:50,568
No, I got this, Cap.

317
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,047
Oh, God.

318
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,180
They questioned us
on the night,

319
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:55,747
they questioned us the next day.

320
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:57,792
Detective Kitchen
did a third pass.

321
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,141
Why are we at this again?

322
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:00,926
Because I need to hear it.

323
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:02,884
So you cut down a back alley.

324
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:04,277
It was a detour, roadwork.

325
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,018
There was a guy
filling potholes.

326
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,760
So one guy, a detour sign,

327
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:11,110
late at night,
down a back alley.

328
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:12,894
You didn't find this suspicious?

329
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:15,027
Are you saying we didn't
do our job, Detective?

330
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:18,247
I'm saying answer
the fuckin' question.

331
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:21,816
Alright, after the fact,
yeah, maybe.

332
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:24,428
In the moment, I saw a detour
and I detoured.

333
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,646
You get a good look at him?

334
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:27,561
He had a respirator
over his mouth.

335
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:31,913
I did see the guy had
a tattoo on his neck.

336
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:36,222
Black, jaggy, punk-ass
tribal-looking thing.

337
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:38,920
So, why were they even moving
the pseudoephedrine anyway?

338
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:41,140
To get it to a more
secure locker downtown.

339
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:42,663
But the merch,
was from a bust two months ago.

340
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:44,273
I mean, why move it now?

341
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:45,362
Well don't ask us.

342
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,015
We're just the messengers.

343
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:49,453
Did you mention the transfer
to anyone beforehand?

344
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,193
No... sir.

345
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,892
Is there anything else... sir?

346
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:55,025
That'll be all.

347
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:10,909
So Miss Consolo, where
does your case stand now?

348
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:12,563
Well, with my evidence
snatched,

349
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:15,348
it gets buried in
the Indiana Jones warehouse.

350
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,220
You know, every time
I think I've got a lead,

351
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:23,617
it disappears... my witnesses,
my only evidence, poof, gone.

352
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,880
All I'm left with are
hunches and theories.

353
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:27,273
Like what?

354
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:31,146
Okay, there's too many
disappearances

355
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:34,411
and witnesses recanting
and suspects moving away

356
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,934
through too many separate cases.

357
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,676
I believe there is
an organized crime network

358
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:40,329
behind this drug bust

359
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:43,115
and half the unsolved crimes
in this town.

360
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:44,899
I'll buy that.

361
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:46,640
Who's behind it?

362
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:49,164
Either off the grid...

363
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,950
or high-profile
and hiding in plain sight.

364
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:53,386
A name?

365
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:56,913
Someone like Angelo Leonetti.

366
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:02,134
Leonetti, shipping
Leonetti, who donates to every

367
00:24:02,136 --> 00:24:06,530
Cleveland civic anything,
including the police fund.

368
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:08,357
Bingo. Hey,

369
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,795
nobody goes after the goose
laying the golden eggs, right?

370
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:13,406
Why doesn't that feel
as strange as it sounds?

371
00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:17,366
My wife would kill me going
after the guy that rebuilt

372
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:21,198
the concert hall, she's a
cellist from the Philharmonic.

373
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,896
Gimme a breadcrumb.

374
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:27,028
Back your way
down the food chain.

375
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,640
If he's got a business front,
so do his associates.

376
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:33,472
- Such as?
- Check out Cohen Construction.

377
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,736
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

378
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:47,484
Mr. Cohen,
can I get you anything?

379
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,791
No.

380
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,490
Oh, everybody's here.

381
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,796
Mr. Leonetti,
how was the ceremony?

382
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:57,145
Very nice, very nice.
They had cake.

383
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:59,060
- Angelo.
- How ya doin', Kenny?

384
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:01,541
Loretta, hold my calls,
would ya?

385
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,108
- Yes sir.
- Yeah.

386
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,458
Albert, give us a minute,
would ya? Thanks.

387
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,416
Sit down.

388
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:09,897
Ahh.

389
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:13,379
- Thanks for coming, Kenny.
- Sure, sure.

390
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:17,078
So what can I do for you,
Angelo?

391
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,691
Well, look, I understand that
you're conducting business

392
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:22,257
outside of channels,

393
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:26,523
and I wanted to hear it
from the horse's mouth.

394
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,046
I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

395
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:29,830
Yes, you are.

396
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:32,180
You've overstepped your bounds.

397
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:34,443
The pseudoephedrine.

398
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:35,836
Look, I was gonna bring it
around to you.

399
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:37,492
But you didn't.

400
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:43,583
Have a fig, yeah?

401
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,193
No.

402
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:47,021
Come on, come on, come on.

403
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:49,154
- Have a fig, Kenny, come on.
- I don't want a fig.

404
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,375
Come on, I grow 'em myself.
They're good for ya.

405
00:25:57,947 --> 00:26:00,644
Look, we have this
gentleman's agreement.

406
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:02,210
There's the hierarchy.

407
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:04,561
You have not honored
that protocol.

408
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,650
I apologize, Angelo.

409
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:09,783
You know I would never do anything
to hurt our relationship.

410
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:12,699
I'd appreciate the situation
not repeating itself.

411
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:16,749
No, no, it won't,
I promise you, it won't.

412
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,098
- Then we're good.
- We're good?

413
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,316
- Yeah.
- We're good.

414
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:23,146
That's it, we're good.

415
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:41,512
No, I'm fine.

416
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:46,211
You ever tried that?

417
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:47,995
Nah.

418
00:26:47,997 --> 00:26:50,824
Looks like a geriatric
Bruce Lee movie

419
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:53,348
in slow motion.

420
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,437
You should try it.

421
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:58,484
Why ruin this body
with muscles?

422
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:03,881
It's like lethal force slowed
down into a meditative pace.

423
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:07,277
Perfect control.

424
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:11,279
We gotta clean things up

425
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:13,455
before questions
start getting asked.

426
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:15,066
So, when?

427
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:16,458
The sooner the better.

428
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,767
He works late most nights.

429
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,075
Okay.

430
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,441
Mr. Cohen?

431
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:45,183
Michael Connolly,
Cleveland P.D.

432
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:47,054
Just wonder if I could
have a moment of your time.

433
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:50,884
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure,
come on, have a seat.

434
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:54,585
Great. I'm looking into last
week's police van holdup.

435
00:27:56,762 --> 00:28:00,807
Oh yeah, yeah, I heard
about that on the news.

436
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,940
What's that got to do with me?

437
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:06,073
Well, we're checking out
businesses that employ ex-cons.

438
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:07,858
You got a program, right?

439
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,775
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
I give 'em a second chance,

440
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:13,341
give something back.

441
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,735
And the tax incentives
don't hurt.

442
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,305
I'm a pragmatist, you know?
Two birds with one stone.

443
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:24,093
Do you have any idea of anyone
that might have been involved?

444
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:31,229
What can I say?
They're all ex-cons.

445
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:33,753
I'm gonna have to ask to
look at your employee records.

446
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:36,234
- Just see who's working for you.
- You are, huh?

447
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:38,412
The department would
appreciate your cooperation.

448
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:42,851
I'll bet it would.

449
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:20,715
What the...

450
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:23,936
Damn kids.

451
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:39,863
Jesus Christ!

452
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:42,737
Evening, Mr. Cohen.

453
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:48,959
The man that came to see you
and just left.

454
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:51,788
Was that a cop?

455
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,704
Aren't you smart?

456
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:57,924
What's his name?

457
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:00,405
None of your business
what his name...

458
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,759
Connolly. Michael Connolly.

459
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,935
Thank you.

460
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:11,242
He had a folder with him.

461
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:14,158
What was in that folder?

462
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,987
He asked me for
some employee records.

463
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:20,338
It looks better
if I cooperate, okay?

464
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,734
You know, I value integrity.

465
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:29,869
Something you seem
to be lacking.

466
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,002
Hey, you wanna tell
your poodle

467
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:35,355
to stop scratching up my car,
you fuckin' Kraut?

468
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:40,271
Do you know who I work with,
huh?

469
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:42,403
If you touch me,
he'll have your head.

470
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:46,059
Who do you think sent me?

471
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,002
Oh, God.

472
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:18,265
What time
did you leave him?

473
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,180
About 7:30.
I must have been

474
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:22,052
the last person
to see him alive.

475
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:24,141
Well, next to last,
anyway.

476
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:25,316
Yeah.

477
00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:27,492
Wasn't a robbery.

478
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:29,798
Somebody didn't like me
talking to him.

479
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,891
So far no prints, Captain,
but we're still checking.

480
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,590
Wait, I got something.

481
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:41,247
We got blood and broken glass.

482
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:45,205
Type this against the victim,

483
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:47,642
run it through the database
and make sure I see the report.

484
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:49,862
Right away, sir.

485
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:53,126
Well, Connolly,
you needed a lead,

486
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:54,606
looks like you got you one.

487
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:55,999
Yeah.

488
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,566
Okay, so what
are we looking at?

489
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:01,874
Cohen used Leonetti's
company here, here, and here.

490
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:05,008
Yup... for shipping.

491
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,794
It's all legit. Michael, we've
got nothing with any teeth here.

492
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:11,101
Cohen's murders got enough
teeth to question him.

493
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:12,667
Neutral stuff... did he have any
enemies?

494
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:15,192
We need hard evidence.

495
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:17,455
Look, you can't go in
at that level,

496
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:20,545
- you'd just be poking the bear.
- Copy that, no bear fucking.

497
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:22,503
I'm serious, Michael.

498
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:27,247
Look, the bee stings the bear...
guess who wins?

499
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:30,122
Back your way
down the food chain.

500
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:36,300
No.

501
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:37,910
Nope.

502
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:38,998
No.

503
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,088
None of 'em.

504
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,829
Yeah, that's the little fucker.

505
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:46,701
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

506
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:47,966
Okay.

507
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:01,455
That was fuckin' lit.

508
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:02,717
Yeah.

509
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:04,719
What are you doin' tonight?

510
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:06,765
That's a good question.

511
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:08,288
What are you doing tonight?

512
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,335
- You.
- Oh-ho-ho!

513
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:13,380
So I hear you're the guy
to know.

514
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:15,165
Depends on what
you're looking for.

515
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,862
A little something
to party on?

516
00:33:16,864 --> 00:33:18,472
What else
you got down there, huh?

517
00:33:18,474 --> 00:33:20,126
- There's enough.
- Oh, yeah?

518
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,693
Yeah it's plenty, come on,

519
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:23,260
we're gonna have a good time,
right?

520
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:25,131
- Freeze, asshole!
- Hold still.

521
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:26,872
You're under arrest,
anything you say

522
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:29,179
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

523
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:31,703
But you already got
that memorized, don't ya?

524
00:33:31,705 --> 00:33:34,012
Fuck. Son of a bitch.

525
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:39,189
Keller Abrams,

526
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:42,540
let's skip right to the part
of who was on the holdup team.

527
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:45,412
- What holdup?
- Points for trying.

528
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:47,501
You were ID'ed at
the scene of the crime.

529
00:33:47,503 --> 00:33:50,243
In your line of work, you should
learn how to blend in more.

530
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:52,941
Look, it's late, I want
to get home for dinner.

531
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:56,206
So, as an unarmed accessory,
I can reduce your sentence

532
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,208
by you cooperating with me.

533
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,905
And if I don't?

534
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:01,776
Then I've got you
selling illegal narcotics

535
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:04,390
to my undercover cop...
it's win-win for me.

536
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,261
So what's in it for me?

537
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:12,135
Well, that says you've got
two priors,

538
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:15,138
so sentencing-wise this wouldn't
work out too well for you.

539
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,143
Let's just say I'll keep you
out of three-strike city.

540
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,406
Guy I work with
brought me in.

541
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:23,929
Ray Blaine.

542
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:26,410
Does he work for Cohen
Construction too?

543
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:29,282
Yeah, he's not shown up
all week.

544
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:30,849
Tell me about him.

545
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:32,938
What do you want to know?

546
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,072
Is he Pisces?
Does he have brown hair?

547
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,119
Take a fuckin' guess.

548
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:43,079
Okay, Ray, and me met up
before with one of the gunmen.

549
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,475
Guy bragged about having
a line in with a bigwig.

550
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,133
Can you put me
in touch with him?

551
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:06,580
Uhh! Ohh!

552
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:09,150
Fuck, yeah. Ahh!

553
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:13,370
Damn.

554
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:17,069
- You are good at that.
- My turn.

555
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:19,941
Let me catch my breath first,
hmm?

556
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:21,031
Ohh.

557
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:27,386
Yeah.

558
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:40,832
Did you paint in here?

559
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,704
Right.

560
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:46,925
Like I'd bother with this dump.

561
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:50,189
We're gonna get a place
of our own, aren't we?

562
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:53,061
Yeah, baby. Yeah,
once this money comes in,

563
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:55,020
we'll get a great place.

564
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:57,588
Maybe a new town?

565
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,984
Ray's gotta find the buyer
for the 'phedrine first.

566
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:05,248
Did that last bit of info
help?

567
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,249
- Yup.
- Yeah?

568
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,902
Yeah.

569
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:11,341
Yeah, it earned me a leg up
with the big man.

570
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:14,213
- It's gonna pay off big-time.
- Good.

571
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,564
Yeah.

572
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:21,004
Speaking of, have you heard
anything else?

573
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:30,664
- First things first.
- What?

574
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:33,537
Catch your breath yet?

575
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:35,278
- Oh.
- My turn.

576
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,977
Okay.

577
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:43,242
Keller's gotta get
Jimmy Marco to say

578
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:46,463
he was there,
and who else was a part of it.

579
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:48,116
And that Cohen hired them.

580
00:36:48,118 --> 00:36:51,078
Laura, breathe.
I got it.

581
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:55,602
- When's he meeting him?
- Ten o'clock.

582
00:36:55,604 --> 00:36:57,604
Okay. Well, let me know
what Marco says.

583
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:59,519
- Yeah.
- Okay?

584
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:01,347
Sarah, I told you
you didn't have to stay,

585
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,609
go get some lunch, honey.

586
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:04,483
I will, thanks.

587
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,537
Hey, Jimmy.

588
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:28,113
So what's so important
that we gotta meet?

589
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:30,768
Wondering what we're doing.

590
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,292
I haven't heard from Ray,
have you?

591
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,425
No.

592
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:38,604
Who do you sell the stuff to?

593
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:42,303
I don't know.

594
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:49,177
Are you okay?

595
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:52,572
You seem a little off.

596
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:54,184
I'm fine.

597
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:59,536
What about that bigwig
you had a line in with?

598
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:01,148
What'd you say his name was?

599
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:06,371
Why are you asking
so many questions?

600
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:09,546
I need to get paid.
I did a job,

601
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:11,506
I want to get paid.
I've got bills.

602
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,727
I didn't say his name.

603
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:20,731
Do me a favor, why don't
you lift your shirt?

604
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,559
What the fuck?

605
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,780
I fuckin' knew it,
motherfucker!

606
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:27,390
- Freeze!
- Jimmy, police!

607
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:29,217
- Shit!
- Jimmy, everybody relax.

608
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,394
- Hold it, Jimmy.
- Hey! Hey hey hey hey!

609
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:33,787
Relax, relax...
Gun! He's got a gun!

610
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:35,833
Gun!

611
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:38,838
Jimmy! Drop...
Drop the gun!

612
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:46,365
Freeze, motherfucker!

613
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,367
Cuffs, give me the cuffs.

614
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:49,803
Shots fired,
one subject down...

615
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:51,588
Don't you fuckin' move.

616
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,677
Requesting an ambulance
onsite.

617
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,158
What do we got?

618
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:01,600
Fuck.

619
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,390
You're quiet tonight.

620
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:14,395
Yeah, I just got a lot
on my mind.

621
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,876
What, work?

622
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:21,010
Oh, I got that big
holdup case.

623
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,622
Michael,
why didn't you say so?

624
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:28,670
I mean, I thought they
gave it to somebody else.

625
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:32,370
What happened?

626
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:38,027
Cap asked if I wanted
the case. I said yeah.

627
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:42,290
Well, aren't you excited?

628
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:45,206
No, it's just a lot of work.

629
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,252
Ah.

630
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:50,170
He teamed you up
with the other guy?

631
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:53,216
Kitchen?

632
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:57,610
Yeah, I'm on the same case.

633
00:39:57,612 --> 00:40:00,265
What time are
you going in tomorrow?

634
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:02,746
Eight o'clock,
organizing task force.

635
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:04,748
Hey, your phones in here,

636
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,227
you just got a text.

637
00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:07,490
What does it say?

638
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:09,100
"Internal Affairs meeting
in a.m.

639
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:10,797
about involvement
in tonight's shooting."

640
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:13,583
- I...
- You were in a shooting?

641
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:16,368
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want you to worry.

642
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,631
No.

643
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:21,244
You didn't want me to know.

644
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:26,160
I'm your partner, Michael...

645
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:29,512
not your backdrop.
There are two of us here.

646
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:32,604
You married a cop.

647
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:38,695
Right, I knew what I was
signing up for,

648
00:40:38,697 --> 00:40:41,088
I knew the dangers.

649
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,395
I just thought that we
were a team, you know,

650
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:46,050
that you wouldn't hide things
from me.

651
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:48,008
It's my job.

652
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,185
This is our life.

653
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:53,712
It affects me too.

654
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:00,632
Here.

655
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:19,257
So the perp pulls a piece
just like this

656
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:22,086
on your dad, point blank,
twitchy as shit.

657
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:25,655
You're dad was as cool
as a Buddha.

658
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:27,483
- Do you know what he did?
- Hmm.

659
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,138
He asks the perp had he ever
killed a guy.

660
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,184
The perp says no,

661
00:41:33,186 --> 00:41:37,318
and your dad said,
"It changes you, man.

662
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,018
Like, I take a bullet,
I'm done in a second.

663
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:46,458
My face will haunt you
in your nightmares.

664
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,766
Trust me. You don't want it."

665
00:41:49,768 --> 00:41:51,594
Do you know what happened?

666
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:52,856
The perp freezes,

667
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:55,075
your dad whip-grabs the pistol,

668
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:56,555
kung-fu's him
to the ground,

669
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:59,776
cuffs him
while I'm pissing my pants.

670
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:05,303
Your dad was one
stone-cold cop.

671
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:07,871
Yeah, he was one
stone-cold father, too.

672
00:42:07,873 --> 00:42:09,829
Oh, Mikey.

673
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:12,007
He did the best he could.

674
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,969
Whatever happened
that night he...

675
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:20,755
You read the report.

676
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:25,412
That was paper.

677
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:29,545
I wanna hear you tell it.

678
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,331
You were there.

679
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:36,247
Drugs went missing
from evidence.

680
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:39,424
I got word that
Stevie was setting up a deal

681
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:41,905
with the Italians.

682
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:48,302
So I go down there, maybe talk
some sense into your dad,

683
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:50,914
the Wop pulls a piece.

684
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,743
Everything went to shit.

685
00:42:53,745 --> 00:42:57,050
He shot him before I
could take him out.

686
00:42:57,052 --> 00:42:59,836
It was over in a second.

687
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,449
I'd like to feel that maybe your
dad was setting him up somehow.

688
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:07,800
Yeah, well, that's not how
Internal Affairs saw it.

689
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:12,065
I fought them to pay
out his benefits, but...

690
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:14,940
Your mom didn't deserve
to lose 'em.

691
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:21,553
I have always felt responsible.

692
00:43:21,555 --> 00:43:24,295
No, don't,
he did it to himself.

693
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:28,954
Mikey, you dad was a good man,
not a perfect one.

694
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:34,522
Anybody could have been tempted.
Anybody.

695
00:43:34,524 --> 00:43:37,177
I mean, he had a wife and a kid
to take care of

696
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:39,005
on a cop's salary.

697
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:43,444
He always had
this wall of approval

698
00:43:43,446 --> 00:43:46,970
that I can never quite
climb my ass over.

699
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:51,104
You know, I used to hate dinner

700
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:54,194
cause he'd grill me...

701
00:43:54,196 --> 00:43:57,241
"Was that up to code, Mikey?"

702
00:43:57,243 --> 00:44:02,507
And I spent my entire childhood
trying to get my ass up to code.

703
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:05,510
It was like running
through the desert,

704
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:09,949
chasing a...

705
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:12,386
- What are those things called?
- Mirage.

706
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:14,954
Mirage, yeah.

707
00:44:14,956 --> 00:44:18,046
Turns out it was all
a bunch of bullshit.

708
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,095
Mikey...

709
00:44:25,097 --> 00:44:28,794
I can say this
because I knew your dad.

710
00:44:28,796 --> 00:44:31,928
Your father had a vision...

711
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:35,192
the man that
he wanted you to be,

712
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:37,370
and that wasn't a lie.

713
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,116
Jimmy.

714
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:49,554
- Have a seat. How'd you sleep?
- Fuck you.

715
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:51,643
Well, let's see how
our date goes first.

716
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:54,124
How'd you get involved
in a police holdup?

717
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:55,516
Yeah, I wasn't.

718
00:44:55,518 --> 00:44:57,823
Well, Keller Abram
said otherwise.

719
00:44:57,825 --> 00:44:59,390
Keller Abram is dead.

720
00:44:59,392 --> 00:45:01,174
Well, you say that like
that's all I got on you,

721
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:03,002
but your parking lot adventure

722
00:45:03,004 --> 00:45:05,004
the other night is enough
to cost ya ten years.

723
00:45:05,006 --> 00:45:07,006
Listen, your only
bargaining chip

724
00:45:07,008 --> 00:45:08,706
is to tell me about the holdup.

725
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:13,099
This guy that brought you in,
Ray Blaine...

726
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:15,623
Yeah?

727
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:18,322
What's his plan?
Where is he now?

728
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:20,585
Haven't seen him
in a few days.

729
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:23,327
So either he took off
with your cut

730
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:25,853
or something happened to him.
I mean, either way...

731
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:30,421
He said he got a better offer
on the stuff,

732
00:45:30,423 --> 00:45:31,988
- Paris had hooked him up.
- Paris?

733
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,774
David Paris.

734
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,168
- Who's your buyer?
- He didn't say,

735
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,083
he just said he was going
downtown to a fish store.

736
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:41,475
Dinner fish or hobby fish?

737
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:43,828
Ya got me,
all I heard was fish.

738
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:49,266
Hmm. Well, I mean,
it sounds like

739
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:52,269
an awfully big score
for little Ray to mastermind.

740
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:53,879
Well, he didn't.

741
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:56,621
He put together the crew,
his boss is behind it.

742
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:58,362
Kenny Cohen,
how'd you know him?

743
00:45:58,364 --> 00:46:00,668
I don't really know him.

744
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,671
Keller said you were bragging about
having some in with some bigwig.

745
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:06,196
Now listen, Jimmy, I can make
this whole thing dependent

746
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:08,285
on you telling me what
you're not telling me.

747
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:10,591
- Bullshit.
- If you're withholding information

748
00:46:10,593 --> 00:46:13,943
that can tie together my case,
you bet your ass I can.

749
00:46:13,945 --> 00:46:15,596
Sometimes I pass info on
to this guy,

750
00:46:15,598 --> 00:46:17,033
he pays me,
what he does with it

751
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:19,383
is none of my business,
but sometimes...

752
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:24,692
sometimes after, the somebody
that's tied to it...

753
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:27,347
Look, any blowback lands
on me, it's over, you know?

754
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:29,612
No, I don't.

755
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,007
It's like a rumor around town,
you mess up, you disappear.

756
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:37,793
Jimmy, you're in police
custody, we can protect you.

757
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,753
No, you can't.

758
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:45,235
Alright, you know what,
the only other option

759
00:46:45,237 --> 00:46:47,759
is to put out the word
you spilled the beans

760
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:50,327
and we release ya
onto the street

761
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:52,285
and then we see if your bigwig

762
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:55,029
and his bogeymen
decide that you messed up.

763
00:46:58,337 --> 00:47:00,554
- I got him.
- Him who?

764
00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:02,774
Leonetti.

765
00:47:02,776 --> 00:47:05,168
- Angelo Leonetti?
- That's the one.

766
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:07,607
Wait, is this based on
the testimony of that kid?

767
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:12,740
Leonetti pays him for
information, people go missing.

768
00:47:12,742 --> 00:47:14,264
How do we play this?

769
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:18,964
Wait, Michael,
there's no "play this.

770
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:21,575
You're talking about one
of our city's patrons.

771
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:23,664
Marco's testimony is enough
to launch an investigation.

772
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:25,449
You're aware that
you're talking about

773
00:47:25,451 --> 00:47:28,278
the guy who bankrolls
the police fund every year,

774
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,715
he plays poker with the mayor,
Michael.

775
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:33,109
So I can't request
a warrant...

776
00:47:33,111 --> 00:47:35,241
There are people
that you go after

777
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:37,591
on the word of some scumbag
punk, and there's...

778
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:39,942
Michael, listen to me...
there's ones that you don't.

779
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:42,509
Cap, we can't let this guy
walk if he's responsible

780
00:47:42,511 --> 00:47:43,946
for half the crimes
in the city

781
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:45,948
just because of all the commas
and zeroes

782
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,514
he has in his tax return.

783
00:47:47,516 --> 00:47:49,777
Michael, you need to find
something

784
00:47:49,779 --> 00:47:52,780
to back up the kid's testimony.

785
00:47:52,782 --> 00:47:55,307
Otherwise, it's mitts off.

786
00:48:08,276 --> 00:48:10,059
Here ya go, missy.

787
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:12,148
Don't forget to water him.

788
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,239
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day.

789
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:41,438
Everybody goes for
the lionfish.

790
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,269
You gotta watch those fin rays,
though, they're poisonous.

791
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:48,575
Personally, I like this
little guy over here,

792
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:50,101
come check this out.

793
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,464
- Ohh... Wow.
- Stonefish.

794
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:09,511
Nobody ever sees
them coming.

795
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:13,339
You looking for anything
in particular today?

796
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:16,516
Ah, wife wanted a baby,
I said let's start with a fish.

797
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,650
Well, if you have any questions,
let me know.

798
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:21,088
Alright.

799
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,835
I just love these little shops.

800
00:49:30,837 --> 00:49:33,359
Little ma-and-pa's.
Been here long?

801
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:35,102
25 years.

802
00:49:36,886 --> 00:49:39,713
You haven't been bought out
by the box stores,

803
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:41,454
Fishes R Us?

804
00:49:41,456 --> 00:49:45,110
Not yet. It's tough
to stay afloat, though.

805
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:48,333
Take a whole lotta guppies.
Mind if I grab one of these?

806
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,119
Puccinaldi. Is that Italian?

807
00:49:54,426 --> 00:49:56,339
Born and raised
in Little Italy.

808
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:58,167
Oh, old-school.
Yeah, my dad, too.

809
00:49:58,169 --> 00:50:01,605
Oh yeah?
What'd he do?

810
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:03,652
A fisherman, actually.

811
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:10,007
You know, I think we need to
set you up with a starter fish.

812
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,129
We had an arrangement, Angelo.

813
00:50:46,826 --> 00:50:49,696
I pocket the 'phedrine,
your case gets buried.

814
00:50:49,698 --> 00:50:53,352
But then you got greedy.

815
00:50:53,354 --> 00:50:55,659
You took it back.

816
00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:57,965
And that upset the balance.

817
00:50:57,967 --> 00:51:00,751
This wasn't my hand, Jack.

818
00:51:00,753 --> 00:51:03,536
You stole what was mine.

819
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:05,582
I don't give a fuck
which minion did it.

820
00:51:05,584 --> 00:51:08,280
That problem has been
eliminated.

821
00:51:08,282 --> 00:51:10,413
And it's your fuckin' job
to cold-case it.

822
00:51:10,415 --> 00:51:13,764
Your sloppy elimination job
is the problem, Angelo,

823
00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:16,941
you left a fuckin' body
in a parking lot.

824
00:51:16,943 --> 00:51:20,162
Tell me, how do I sweep
that under the rug?

825
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:22,425
There's just so many holes
in the boat I can plug up.

826
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:25,471
Why don't you just pull off
your bloodhound puppy, huh?

827
00:51:25,473 --> 00:51:27,343
Cause he's nipping at heels.

828
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:29,345
It's a little late for that,
Angelo.

829
00:51:29,347 --> 00:51:33,175
Your jailbird?
He's flapping his jaw.

830
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:35,568
Give me a fuckin' break.

831
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,309
That's hearsay from
a goddamn lowlife.

832
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:40,051
It's enough to kick-start
the kid's case,

833
00:51:40,053 --> 00:51:42,967
and I've tugged his collar all
I can without raising eyebrows.

834
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:45,187
Take him off the case, Jack.

835
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:47,452
It's in your best interest.

836
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:52,237
That sounds a lot
like a threat to me.

837
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:55,371
Nah, that's just a little
friendly advice.

838
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:58,504
A threat would be more like
making

839
00:51:58,506 --> 00:52:01,028
your extracurricular
entrepreneurships public.

840
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,988
That goes both ways,
old friend.

841
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,427
No honor among thieves huh?

842
00:52:09,604 --> 00:52:13,040
Killing you, it just
might be worth it.

843
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:15,434
You know what
we got in common?

844
00:52:15,436 --> 00:52:17,088
We got enough common sense
to curb

845
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:19,960
our baser instincts for
the benefit of mutual gain.

846
00:52:19,962 --> 00:52:22,702
And we can hate each other
as much as we want,

847
00:52:22,704 --> 00:52:24,576
but we need each other.

848
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:28,580
Right the ship, Jack.

849
00:53:00,742 --> 00:53:01,917
Yeah?

850
00:53:03,919 --> 00:53:06,224
Confirmed?

851
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:08,359
Marco's dead?

852
00:53:10,709 --> 00:53:12,189
Yeah.

853
00:53:13,451 --> 00:53:15,496
Yeah, no, thanks.

854
00:53:18,804 --> 00:53:20,806
Fuck!

855
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:20,213
Born and raised in Little Italy.

856
00:54:21,736 --> 00:54:22,998
Shit.

857
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:43,147
Larceny, B and E, petty theft,
truancy...

858
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:45,018
I mean, he was a real
little Al Capone.

859
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,978
From the last one, May '77,
he did a year in Juvie.

860
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,763
So what, after
that he just went straight?

861
00:54:50,765 --> 00:54:53,331
Or he got smart.
Check out the police report.

862
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:57,640
Look who is listed at the last
B and E, and walked away,

863
00:54:57,642 --> 00:55:00,253
while Carmen did a year
in Juvie.

864
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:03,082
Oh, my God.

865
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:12,872
That was us once.

866
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:15,484
The hood didn't have
nice parks.

867
00:55:15,486 --> 00:55:18,356
We were knocking over
liquor stores.

868
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:22,404
- Could have been different.
- Nah, it's in the blood.

869
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:23,711
Yeah.

870
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:29,715
I gotta tell you something,
Carmen.

871
00:55:29,717 --> 00:55:32,283
I'm sick of all this drug shit.

872
00:55:32,285 --> 00:55:34,067
I wanna be done with it.

873
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:36,113
This is not how
I wanna be remembered.

874
00:55:36,115 --> 00:55:39,290
Kidding me? You're gonna be
remembered as a patron saint.

875
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:43,207
Ah, bullshit. It's all
built on a house of cards.

876
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:44,687
I guess I opened up
a can of worms

877
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:47,124
bringing the ephedrine back
from Cohen.

878
00:55:47,126 --> 00:55:49,518
I should have asked you first.
I'm sorry, Ange.

879
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,130
You didn't know.

880
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:56,481
- Carmen.
- Yeah?

881
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:59,441
About the pseudoephedrine...
you should handle it.

882
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:01,399
- Yeah, right.
- No, right.

883
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:04,141
Take it.
Just move the stuff.

884
00:56:04,143 --> 00:56:05,664
- You're serious?
- Yeah, yeah.

885
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:08,754
You know my contacts.
Just move the stuff.

886
00:56:08,756 --> 00:56:11,627
You can have my cut.

887
00:56:11,629 --> 00:56:13,542
- Huh?
- Hey, Ange,

888
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:16,109
you got a brain tumor
or something?

889
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:18,462
I don't have
a fuckin' brain tumor.

890
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:23,290
I don't trust anybody but you.

891
00:56:23,292 --> 00:56:24,729
Capisce?

892
00:56:26,295 --> 00:56:27,862
Thank you.

893
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:39,959
Detective Connolly,
I have the DNA results

894
00:56:39,961 --> 00:56:42,701
from the blood on that
glass shard at Cohen's car.

895
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:45,617
- Canis lupus familiaris.
- What is that?

896
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:47,097
Doggy.

897
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:49,101
Doberman.

898
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:52,321
Thank you.

899
00:57:57,648 --> 00:58:00,257
Shit!

900
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,586
Hey, I was just about
to call you.

901
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:26,979
A dog
just attacked me.

902
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:28,851
A dog just attacked you.
Where?

903
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:31,288
- In my office.
- In your office?

904
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:34,206
- In my fucking office.
- Jesus, you okay?

905
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:36,728
Wait, what kinda dog?

906
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,862
A big scary-as-shit kind,
with teeth.

907
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:41,211
Where is it now?

908
00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:43,343
I don't know.

909
00:58:43,345 --> 00:58:45,824
Okay listen, the blood match
on Cohen's car was a Doberman.

910
00:58:45,826 --> 00:58:47,304
Yeah, yeah,
that was it, a Doberman.

911
00:58:47,306 --> 00:58:48,827
I mean, we gotta be
getting close

912
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,220
if they're trying to scare you.

913
00:58:50,222 --> 00:58:52,920
Wait. Who else knows
about this case?

914
00:59:05,977 --> 00:59:08,630
You have one new message.

915
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:11,415
First new message sent today.

916
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:15,288
Evening, Sarah.

917
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,116
Who are you?

918
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:21,077
I'm a friend of Jimmy's.

919
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:23,645
You knew Jimmy?

920
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:25,951
Yeah.

921
00:59:25,953 --> 00:59:28,519
I'm really sorry
what happened to him.

922
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:32,567
You know, Jimmy used to
provide us with information

923
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,832
that you got from that female
attorney you're working with.

924
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:41,880
What did she and this young
detective talk about this morning?

925
00:59:41,882 --> 00:59:43,795
They talked about getting

926
00:59:43,797 --> 00:59:46,755
a search warrant
for Carmen Puccinaldi.

927
00:59:46,757 --> 00:59:49,671
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

928
00:59:52,763 --> 00:59:55,807
You know, I can get a lot
of information for you.

929
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:58,418
I can do whatever you want.
I have connections in

930
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,856
the District Attorneys office,
I'm really good at this,

931
01:00:00,858 --> 01:00:02,945
- I've been doing for a while.
- Yeah, yeah.

932
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:05,469
That's very good.

933
01:00:05,471 --> 01:00:07,778
I like that idea.

934
01:00:13,087 --> 01:00:15,786
May I have a glass of water?

935
01:00:17,439 --> 01:00:19,614
Okay.

936
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,921
Yeah, sure.

937
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:33,149
Carmen,
want another one?

938
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:35,806
- Yeah babe, hit me again.
- You got it.

939
01:00:37,024 --> 01:00:38,633
- Carmen.
- Hey, man.

940
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,286
Can I get you something?

941
01:00:40,288 --> 01:00:42,769
No, I'm fine, thank you.

942
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:50,166
Hey, listen.

943
01:00:50,168 --> 01:00:55,650
The cops are obtaining
a search warrant on you.

944
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,826
It's no problem.
Angelo will get me outta that.

945
01:00:57,828 --> 01:00:59,741
One phone call to the mayor.

946
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,744
No, it's past that point.

947
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:04,791
Says who?

948
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:12,579
He wants me to
take the fall again.

949
01:01:12,581 --> 01:01:14,409
Fuckin' Angelo.

950
01:01:21,242 --> 01:01:24,463
He's not untouchable, you know.

951
01:01:30,382 --> 01:01:32,776
So what's this, a warning?

952
01:01:34,865 --> 01:01:38,607
No, my friend,
it's a head start.

953
01:01:40,305 --> 01:01:42,609
Okay?

954
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:44,613
Take it easy.

955
01:02:15,906 --> 01:02:18,123
Goddamn it, I knew it.
Fuckin' cop.

956
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,300
Hey, what's up?

957
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:23,912
Open the door,
you little ravioli.

958
01:02:23,914 --> 01:02:26,566
We open in 20.

959
01:02:26,568 --> 01:02:28,394
Open the door.

960
01:02:28,396 --> 01:02:32,094
What happened,
your goldfish die?

961
01:02:32,096 --> 01:02:34,357
Yeah. I got the key in the back.
I just gotta...

962
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:37,275
Alright boys. Now, back alley.
Door. Right now. Get him.

963
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:40,887
Let's go. Move, move, move.

964
01:02:44,412 --> 01:02:46,240
Fuck! Where are the keys?!

965
01:02:48,068 --> 01:02:50,767
Fuck me.

966
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:53,811
- Hi.
- Fuck you!

967
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:57,597
Carmen, drop the gun.

968
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,643
You drop it.

969
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:01,516
Dude, seriously?

970
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:06,783
Four against one, you think
you're gonna get very far?

971
01:03:10,177 --> 01:03:12,003
Awright, fuck it,
I'll tell ya everything

972
01:03:12,005 --> 01:03:13,831
you wanna know about
Angelo Leonetti.

973
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,833
- Okay.
- I'm not letting

974
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:18,053
that motherfucker
throw me under the bus again.

975
01:03:18,055 --> 01:03:20,272
You cut me a deal, I'll tell
you who the real Angelo...

976
01:03:20,274 --> 01:03:22,100
Who shot?

977
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:24,363
Down, down, down, down,
down, get down!

978
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:25,887
Guys, check the roofs!

979
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:26,975
Check the roofs!

980
01:03:26,977 --> 01:03:28,585
Check the roofs!

981
01:03:28,587 --> 01:03:30,630
Man down, we got a man down!

982
01:03:30,632 --> 01:03:31,631
Someone check the roof.

983
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:54,091
You are low
man on the totem pole here.

984
01:03:56,702 --> 01:03:58,180
I believe there is

985
01:03:58,182 --> 01:04:00,184
an organized crime network.

986
01:04:02,055 --> 01:04:03,968
You need to find something

987
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:07,365
to back up the kid's testimony,
otherwise it's mitts off.

988
01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:12,759
Who's behind it?

989
01:04:12,761 --> 01:04:15,112
Someone like Angelo Leonetti.

990
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:54,976
I didn't realize
anyone was there. Sorry.

991
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:58,022
Well, I didn't mean
to startle you. Sorry.

992
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:01,156
No, it's okay.

993
01:05:01,158 --> 01:05:03,462
Embarrassed is more like it.

994
01:05:03,464 --> 01:05:06,378
No, on the contrary.

995
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:10,513
Johann Sebastian Bach's Courante

996
01:05:10,515 --> 01:05:12,732
requires great discipline,

997
01:05:12,734 --> 01:05:14,386
tempo giusto.

998
01:05:14,388 --> 01:05:17,520
Bravo. Impressive.

999
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:20,740
Your "name that tune"
is impressive.

1000
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:23,134
Are you a musician?

1001
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:26,007
Me, musician? No, no.

1002
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:28,574
But my grandfather was.

1003
01:05:28,576 --> 01:05:33,320
Unfortunately, it didn't
trickle down to me.

1004
01:05:34,974 --> 01:05:37,235
May I?

1005
01:05:37,237 --> 01:05:39,020
Sure, please.

1006
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:40,501
Thank you.

1007
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:45,550
Wow.

1008
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:51,467
What did your grandfather
play?

1009
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:54,428
My grand...
Oh! Violin.

1010
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:59,779
With the Berlin Philharmonics.

1011
01:05:59,781 --> 01:06:02,826
But unfortunately,

1012
01:06:02,828 --> 01:06:07,396
the Nazis came to power.

1013
01:06:07,398 --> 01:06:09,748
He was drafted.

1014
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:19,930
You know, my grandfather,
he used to tell me stories

1015
01:06:19,932 --> 01:06:22,628
from the war...

1016
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:25,370
horrific things, really.

1017
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:27,503
But he always told me.

1018
01:06:27,505 --> 01:06:32,899
I'm telling you this so that you
can one day tell your children

1019
01:06:32,901 --> 01:06:37,078
and they in their turn
can tell theirs

1020
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:40,298
and hopefully
this horrible thing

1021
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,521
will never happen again.

1022
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:01,493
My grandfather said,

1023
01:07:01,495 --> 01:07:05,021
"I wish they have sent me
to the front to die."

1024
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:12,722
No, instead, he was sent
to a concentration camp

1025
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:16,552
and he served in a unit
where they separated children

1026
01:07:16,554 --> 01:07:18,641
from their parents...

1027
01:07:18,643 --> 01:07:21,948
healthy children
to the work stations,

1028
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:24,779
and... the other children...

1029
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:32,611
One day the officers found
out that my grandfather

1030
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:34,657
was a great violinist,

1031
01:07:34,659 --> 01:07:37,573
and they ordered him
to put together

1032
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:42,099
some entertainment for the
officers when they had a party,

1033
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:45,322
entertainment performed
by the Jewish prisoners.

1034
01:07:47,106 --> 01:07:52,718
Then there was this
Christmas celebration...

1035
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:57,984
and there was a young girl,
12, 13 years old,

1036
01:07:57,986 --> 01:08:01,945
with the voice of an angel,
according to my grandfather,

1037
01:08:01,947 --> 01:08:05,429
and she sang for the officers.

1038
01:08:07,344 --> 01:08:09,779
Then one officer stood up
and said,

1039
01:08:09,781 --> 01:08:12,912
"No more of this Jewish shit!

1040
01:08:12,914 --> 01:08:16,351
I wanna hear
a German Christmas song,

1041
01:08:16,353 --> 01:08:18,570
I wanna hear Silent Night."

1042
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:23,271
She didn't know Silent Night,
the Jewish girl.

1043
01:08:23,273 --> 01:08:26,143
The officer went up to her
and slapped her

1044
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:29,714
and said, "You better sing
Silent Night."

1045
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:34,456
Officer went up
to my grandfather and said,

1046
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:38,636
"You take this piece of shit
outside and kill her."

1047
01:08:40,725 --> 01:08:44,118
Imagine that little girl,

1048
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:49,949
performing for those killers...

1049
01:08:49,951 --> 01:08:55,172
the fear when she didn't know
the song,

1050
01:08:55,174 --> 01:08:59,742
the terror...

1051
01:08:59,744 --> 01:09:02,225
when she thought
she was about to be shot.

1052
01:09:05,924 --> 01:09:10,927
My grandfather took the little
girl outside, as ordered,

1053
01:09:10,929 --> 01:09:13,886
but he couldn't kill her.

1054
01:09:13,888 --> 01:09:19,196
Instead he found a way out
from the camp

1055
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:23,246
and he told her,
"Run! Never look back."

1056
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:29,815
Well, my grandfather
survived the war,

1057
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:33,299
but he never touched
his violin ever again.

1058
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:41,871
Would you mind...

1059
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:44,397
playing the Courante for me?

1060
01:11:08,655 --> 01:11:10,266
Thank you.

1061
01:11:14,748 --> 01:11:17,098
Wait, I don't even know
your name.

1062
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:24,367
It's perfect that way,
isn't it?

1063
01:12:02,405 --> 01:12:06,842
Mr. Leonetti, Detective
Michael Connolly, Cleveland P.D.

1064
01:12:06,844 --> 01:12:09,105
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions.

1065
01:12:09,107 --> 01:12:10,541
This could be done
another time.

1066
01:12:10,543 --> 01:12:12,064
You always attend the funerals
of people who die

1067
01:12:12,066 --> 01:12:13,544
on your watch,
Detective Connolly?

1068
01:12:13,546 --> 01:12:15,851
I'm sorry for your loss,
Mr. Leonetti,

1069
01:12:15,853 --> 01:12:19,245
it's just that Mr. Puccinaldi's
last words were of you.

1070
01:12:19,247 --> 01:12:22,336
He said he wasn't willing
to die to protect you.

1071
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,468
Do you have any idea
what he might have meant?

1072
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:26,949
Alright, that's enough.
Leave Mr. Leonetti alone!

1073
01:12:26,951 --> 01:12:29,345
Now, now, now, Albert,
Albert please, please.

1074
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:36,785
Look, Detective Connolly,

1075
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:39,265
Mr. Puccinaldi
was a childhood friend,

1076
01:12:39,267 --> 01:12:42,051
and I am truly devastated
over his tragic death,

1077
01:12:42,053 --> 01:12:45,228
as well as the revelation
that apparently he hadn't put

1078
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:48,362
the habits of his juvenile
delinquent past behind him.

1079
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,320
But if you're on
a wild goose chase

1080
01:12:50,322 --> 01:12:53,323
to somehow link
his criminal activities to me,

1081
01:12:53,325 --> 01:12:55,458
there'll be consequences.

1082
01:12:58,548 --> 01:13:00,506
Tell your captain.

1083
01:13:02,203 --> 01:13:04,421
What consequences
am I telling him, sir?

1084
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:05,555
Let's go.

1085
01:14:54,577 --> 01:14:58,100
I need an ID on
8900 Chestnut Road.

1086
01:14:58,102 --> 01:15:00,494
Stand by.

1087
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:04,062
Private residence,
one Angelo J. Leonetti.

1088
01:15:04,064 --> 01:15:05,805
Alright, copy.

1089
01:15:11,942 --> 01:15:13,419
We're in the eighth inning,

1090
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:16,727
and so far it's been
a very tight game.

1091
01:15:16,729 --> 01:15:19,776
Two outs,
with a runner on first base...

1092
01:15:42,059 --> 01:15:44,668
Thanks, buddy.
Have a good night.

1093
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:45,887
I'll see ya in the morning.

1094
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:17,573
Good evening.

1095
01:16:22,316 --> 01:16:24,188
A little Scotch neat?

1096
01:16:25,406 --> 01:16:27,104
Yeah.

1097
01:16:31,761 --> 01:16:34,067
25 Mac, yeah?

1098
01:16:36,766 --> 01:16:38,287
- Thanks.
- Salude.

1099
01:16:38,289 --> 01:16:39,595
Salude.

1100
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:46,558
I thought Jack did
his own wet work.

1101
01:16:48,865 --> 01:16:50,606
Fuckin' Mick.

1102
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:55,173
So...

1103
01:16:55,175 --> 01:16:57,961
I didn't know you served
two masters, Schlychter.

1104
01:16:59,571 --> 01:17:03,268
Well, I gotta hand it
to both of ya,

1105
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:05,270
'cause not much surprises me.

1106
01:17:05,272 --> 01:17:07,838
But this...
this explains a little bit.

1107
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,191
Like Cohen's body bein'
left for the cops to find.

1108
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:25,595
I'll double whatever
he's paying ya.

1109
01:17:25,597 --> 01:17:27,728
I'm sorry.

1110
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:31,601
Compensation
is not the sole issue here.

1111
01:17:31,603 --> 01:17:33,385
Oh, integrity?
You?

1112
01:17:40,568 --> 01:17:42,440
Okay.

1113
01:17:43,963 --> 01:17:47,182
Carmen. Yeah, yeah.

1114
01:17:47,184 --> 01:17:50,881
Crossed my mind that
that might rankle your code.

1115
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:54,232
He was a likable little fucker,
wasn't he, huh? Ha.

1116
01:17:54,234 --> 01:17:57,932
I loved him, though.
I did, I loved him.

1117
01:17:57,934 --> 01:17:59,326
You don't mind if I smoke,
do ya?

1118
01:18:01,764 --> 01:18:03,504
Heh.

1119
01:18:23,524 --> 01:18:26,136
We ran a tight ship,
didn't we?

1120
01:18:27,311 --> 01:18:30,573
We sure did, Mr. Leonetti.

1121
01:18:30,575 --> 01:18:34,751
But eventually someone's
gotta pay the piper, right?

1122
01:18:34,753 --> 01:18:38,320
Fuck you, Schlychter,
you Kraut bastard.

1123
01:18:38,322 --> 01:18:40,931
Son of a...

1124
01:18:40,933 --> 01:18:45,111
Might be a Kraut,
but I'm not stupid.

1125
01:19:09,962 --> 01:19:11,572
Police!

1126
01:19:36,075 --> 01:19:37,988
Freeze!

1127
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:42,210
Attack! Go!

1128
01:19:47,739 --> 01:19:49,915
Klaus! Enough.

1129
01:19:55,225 --> 01:19:58,226
You don't work for Leonetti.

1130
01:19:58,228 --> 01:20:01,492
I did, but he's retired.

1131
01:20:04,147 --> 01:20:06,277
You better start thinking.

1132
01:20:06,279 --> 01:20:09,759
Your decisions affect
more than just you.

1133
01:20:09,761 --> 01:20:12,283
You see, I have another
assignment for tonight.

1134
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:21,205
Klaus, you traitor.

1135
01:20:21,207 --> 01:20:24,297
Come on, let's go.

1136
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:30,086
It's a beautiful night.

1137
01:20:34,742 --> 01:20:36,917
Michael?

1138
01:20:36,919 --> 01:20:39,833
Michael.

1139
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,574
I don't want you
disappearing like Kitchen.

1140
01:20:45,231 --> 01:20:47,492
I'll tell you everything
you wanna know about Angelo Leonetti.

1141
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,454
You always
attend the funerals of people

1142
01:20:52,456 --> 01:20:54,980
who die on your watch,
Detective?

1143
01:20:59,332 --> 01:21:02,681
Who do you think has to bury you?

1144
01:21:07,297 --> 01:21:11,212
Your father had a vision,

1145
01:21:11,214 --> 01:21:14,693
the man that
he wanted you to be,

1146
01:21:14,695 --> 01:21:17,261
and that wasn't a lie.

1147
01:21:17,263 --> 01:21:20,743
You've gotta
find a way to forgive him.

1148
01:21:24,967 --> 01:21:28,359
Hey. Hey, kid.

1149
01:21:28,361 --> 01:21:31,319
- Wake up, kid. Hey, you dead?
- Ahh.

1150
01:21:31,321 --> 01:21:33,625
Jesus, hell of a place
to take a nap.

1151
01:21:33,627 --> 01:21:36,411
Easy now, cowboy.
We had a 911. Shots fired.

1152
01:21:36,413 --> 01:21:39,240
Were some of them yours?

1153
01:21:39,242 --> 01:21:42,591
- I saw the shooter.
- Yeah, I know, we're on it.

1154
01:21:42,593 --> 01:21:44,332
He may still be in the area.

1155
01:21:44,334 --> 01:21:46,073
No, he's not.

1156
01:21:46,075 --> 01:21:49,554
Kid! Where the fuck you going?

1157
01:21:55,867 --> 01:21:58,302
- Cap, Leonetti's dead.
- What happened?

1158
01:21:58,304 --> 01:22:00,391
Shot in his house.
I got there right after

1159
01:22:00,393 --> 01:22:02,132
and went after the perp,
but he got away.

1160
01:22:02,134 --> 01:22:04,178
Okay, where are you?

1161
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:07,268
I'm heading back to the station
to get an APB on the shooter.

1162
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:09,531
Alright, I can call that in from here.
Come on over.

1163
01:22:09,533 --> 01:22:14,057
Okay, we got a white male,
fifties, black Jaguar,

1164
01:22:14,059 --> 01:22:17,582
Ohio plates P K Y 7 2 K.

1165
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:19,671
I'm five away.

1166
01:22:30,162 --> 01:22:32,599
- Cap!
- In the kitchen.

1167
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,558
- Fuck.
- You look like shit.

1168
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,168
Yeah, well, I had help.

1169
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:39,778
I should see the other guy,
right?

1170
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:41,171
Yeah, well,
I did see the other guy,

1171
01:22:41,173 --> 01:22:42,694
- I can ID this guy...
- Which, by the way,

1172
01:22:42,696 --> 01:22:44,740
I owe you an apology
on Leonetti.

1173
01:22:44,742 --> 01:22:46,568
He was in this after all...
You like this black, right?

1174
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:50,050
Yeah, yeah. Listen,
this guy is tying up loose ends.

1175
01:22:50,052 --> 01:22:52,356
He's gonna leave town.
He knows what I look like...

1176
01:22:52,358 --> 01:22:54,141
Michael, I know, I know.

1177
01:22:54,143 --> 01:22:56,754
They filled me in when I called
in the APB on Schlychter.

1178
01:23:06,677 --> 01:23:09,373
Mikey, do you remember when
your dad and I took you

1179
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:12,289
to Municipal Stadium
to see the Indians play

1180
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:14,467
on your seventh birthday?

1181
01:23:15,642 --> 01:23:18,078
It was cloudy out...

1182
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:22,821
and you were concerned that
it was gonna get rained out.

1183
01:23:22,823 --> 01:23:26,216
Do you remember what your dad
said to you?

1184
01:23:26,218 --> 01:23:30,875
He said, "No way am I gonna let
it rain on my son's birthday."

1185
01:23:33,051 --> 01:23:36,879
And sure enough, I'll be damned
if the sun didn't come out.

1186
01:23:36,881 --> 01:23:38,665
Schlychter.

1187
01:23:40,493 --> 01:23:42,539
I never said his name.

1188
01:23:44,323 --> 01:23:46,064
I know.

1189
01:23:48,893 --> 01:23:51,546
Guess Kitchen figured it out
too, huh?

1190
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:54,418
No.

1191
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:56,812
Kitchen wanted a bigger cut
to keep from snitching

1192
01:23:56,814 --> 01:24:00,076
to Leonetti that
I had had him tip off Cohen

1193
01:24:00,078 --> 01:24:01,991
to the drug transfer
to begin with.

1194
01:24:01,993 --> 01:24:04,863
So Cohen took the bait
and stole your drugs,

1195
01:24:04,865 --> 01:24:08,173
giving you the excuse
to take Leonetti down.

1196
01:24:10,523 --> 01:24:14,005
And I'm the dumb rookie cop
you threw on the case.

1197
01:24:16,268 --> 01:24:19,054
You're not as dumb
as I thought you were.

1198
01:24:22,318 --> 01:24:26,061
However, you did walk in here
without your gun, Michael.

1199
01:24:29,847 --> 01:24:32,021
Mikey...

1200
01:24:32,023 --> 01:24:35,938
I'll give you Kitchen's 20%.

1201
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:39,857
We take over Leonetti's
territory, we make a killing.

1202
01:24:44,862 --> 01:24:48,037
I'm sorry, Cap.

1203
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:50,868
Dirty cop's not
my five-year plan.

1204
01:24:53,305 --> 01:24:56,134
Schlychter said he had
one more assignment.

1205
01:24:59,659 --> 01:25:03,139
What was it, Cap?

1206
01:25:03,141 --> 01:25:04,749
You.

1207
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:06,142
- Ohh!
- Unhh!

1208
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,724
- Unhh!
- Ahhh!

1209
01:25:28,558 --> 01:25:32,127
I hated having to kill
your father, Mikey.

1210
01:25:34,651 --> 01:25:38,568
Klaus, go!

1211
01:25:39,612 --> 01:25:41,046
Schlychter!

1212
01:25:47,925 --> 01:25:50,971
Klaus, enough.

1213
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:56,801
Your fuckin' dog can't
even follow a command.

1214
01:25:56,803 --> 01:26:00,457
Well, he did, you asshole.

1215
01:26:00,459 --> 01:26:03,243
You fuckin' Kraut.

1216
01:26:03,245 --> 01:26:06,422
Yeah, I keep getting that. Hmm.

1217
01:26:27,094 --> 01:26:29,184
I'm sorry, Mikey.

1218
01:26:46,723 --> 01:26:48,942
Nice shot.

1219
01:26:51,118 --> 01:26:55,340
He was planning to kill me
after I killed you.

1220
01:26:59,997 --> 01:27:03,607
You could've taken me out.
Twice.

1221
01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:07,089
Oh, more than that.

1222
01:27:07,091 --> 01:27:10,701
Why didn't you?

1223
01:27:10,703 --> 01:27:16,185
Because we both descend
from misjudged men,

1224
01:27:16,187 --> 01:27:18,537
and you're an honorable one.

1225
01:27:21,584 --> 01:27:24,326
Oh, and Klaus likes you.

1226
01:27:29,635 --> 01:27:32,812
I'll give you 10 minutes
before I call it in.

1227
01:27:34,074 --> 01:27:35,944
Is that a warning?

1228
01:27:35,946 --> 01:27:38,165
It's a head start.

1229
01:28:27,824 --> 01:28:31,697
I got something to tell you.

1230
01:28:38,487 --> 01:28:40,706
I hate eggs.

1231
01:28:44,144 --> 01:28:46,408
You hate eggs?

1232
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:54,631
But... you love my Sunday morning
omelets.

1233
01:28:54,633 --> 01:28:57,332
I lied. I can't stand 'em.

1234
01:29:04,382 --> 01:29:06,904
Alright, it's your turn.

1235
01:29:06,906 --> 01:29:09,733
I like fortune cookies

1236
01:29:09,735 --> 01:29:12,954
that actually give you
a fortune,

1237
01:29:12,956 --> 01:29:15,435
like tell me I'm going
on a trip, or...

1238
01:29:15,437 --> 01:29:18,089
- Yeah. Yeah.
- like, I'm gonna win the lottery or something.

1239
01:29:18,091 --> 01:29:20,180
Yeah.

1240
01:29:35,152 --> 01:29:37,457
The thumb drive that
you took from Jack's house

1241
01:29:37,459 --> 01:29:40,024
has evidence on at least
half my open cases.

1242
01:29:40,026 --> 01:29:42,070
Well, be careful
what you wish for.

1243
01:29:42,072 --> 01:29:45,203
I'll remember. Next time.

1244
01:29:45,205 --> 01:29:48,598
Listen, go home,
put your feet up,

1245
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,905
it'll still be there tomorrow.

1246
01:29:50,907 --> 01:29:53,300
- Hey, Connolly.
- Yeah?

1247
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,565
You done good.

1248
01:29:59,002 --> 01:30:01,089
Divers are ready.
Where do you want 'em?

1249
01:30:01,091 --> 01:30:03,004
We gotta cover it all,
so start at the dock

1250
01:30:03,006 --> 01:30:04,266
and sweep your way out.

1251
01:30:04,268 --> 01:30:05,398
Copy that.

1252
01:30:07,576 --> 01:30:09,273
Hey, guys, so listen...

1253
01:30:12,711 --> 01:30:14,319
So you heard?

1254
01:30:14,321 --> 01:30:18,106
This Schlychter guy...
FBI, Interpol,

1255
01:30:18,108 --> 01:30:20,282
there's no record of him.

1256
01:30:20,284 --> 01:30:22,197
Ten-to-one they never find him.

1257
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:24,329
Yeah, that's
a pretty good bet.

1258
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:26,070
Internal Affairs
had a field day

1259
01:30:26,072 --> 01:30:27,724
with that thumb drive, though.

1260
01:30:27,726 --> 01:30:29,944
It's got Jack on the
phone ordering executions,

1261
01:30:29,946 --> 01:30:32,163
from Leonetti all the way down.

1262
01:30:32,165 --> 01:30:34,731
You were the last of 'em.

1263
01:30:34,733 --> 01:30:38,300
But you know, if Jack
would've been thinking,

1264
01:30:38,302 --> 01:30:40,824
he'd have called me.

1265
01:30:40,826 --> 01:30:43,566
I'd have killed you for free.

1266
01:30:43,568 --> 01:30:46,743
Well, with your aim,
I think I'd be safe.

1267
01:30:46,745 --> 01:30:48,878
Yeah, right.

1268
01:30:56,538 --> 01:30:58,451
I'm interviewing
the witness later today.

1269
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,585
Okay.

1270
01:31:17,341 --> 01:31:19,430
Did you know him?

1271
01:31:20,431 --> 01:31:22,607
He's my father.

1272
01:31:23,913 --> 01:31:25,913
I'm sorry for your loss.

1273
01:31:25,915 --> 01:31:28,395
You must be proud of him.

1274
01:31:33,052 --> 01:31:35,096
Yeah.

1275
01:31:35,098 --> 01:31:36,621
I am.
