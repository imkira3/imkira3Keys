1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:47,262
You were incredible.

3
00:00:47,718 --> 00:00:49,927
My heart is still racing.

4
00:00:51,377 --> 00:00:53,137
I felt it too.

5
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:55,174
All thanks
to your brute strength, Dash,

6
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:58,418
and your knowledge
of ancient Aramaic mathematics.

7
00:00:58,522 --> 00:01:01,421
Please. This has nothing to do
with my two doctorates

8
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:03,596
and my master's
in Gender Studies

9
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:07,462
and everything to do
with you, Dr. Lovemore.

10
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:09,809
The truth is,

11
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:12,294
I never thought I would find
the Lost City of D.

12
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:15,332
I would choose your words carefully.

13
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:17,196
They will be your last.

14
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,062
You led me right
to King Kalaman's tomb

15
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:24,755
and his queen's
legendary Crown of Fire.

16
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:27,758
And now I will be very rich,

17
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:30,554
and you will be very dead.

18
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:34,869
Hold up. Are these...
Are these your snakes?

19
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:36,594
No, they were just here.

20
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:39,149
There were just hundreds
of snakes in this temple

21
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:41,116
just waiting for us to show up?

22
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,325
- Who feeds them? You feed them?
- No, what do they eat?

23
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,638
Why is that one not biting that guy?
Why is that happening?

24
00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:48,606
- Are they trained not to bite henchmen or something?
- Yeah, well...

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,988
I mean,
the snake-to-temple ratio alone...

26
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:53,542
This is ridiculous.
Delete.

27
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,718
I... I think my character
can still work.

28
00:01:56,822 --> 00:01:58,547
Delete.

29
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,826
Loretta, you still have
a story to write.

30
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:02,828
Delete.

31
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,073
<i>Hey, it's me, Beth.</i>

32
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:09,593
<i>I don't want to pull the whole "I'm
your publisher" card, but I am.</i>

33
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,044
<i>And I'm really looking forward
to seeing this last chapter.</i>

34
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:14,184
<i>But no pressure.
No, there actually is pressure.</i>

35
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:18,464
<i>The exact amount of pressure that
motivates you but doesn't paralyze you.</i>

36
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:19,948
<i>You got this.</i>

37
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,468
Thank you.

38
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:24,608
<i>Me again.</i>

39
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,575
<i>Okay, so everything
is set for the book tour,</i>

40
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,509
<i>but, uh, the only thing we need
is a book to tour with.</i>

41
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:31,753
<i>I can't help but get the feeling
that you're not finishing</i>

42
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:34,307
<i>because you don't want
to leave your house.</i>

43
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:39,588
<i>Listen, I know these last five years
have been hard after John's passing,</i>

44
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:43,075
<i>and it feels easier
to live in your bathtub,</i>

45
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:45,836
<i>drinking Chardonnay on ice.</i>

46
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,735
<i>But, girl, there is a great
big world waiting for you</i>

47
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,842
<i>and a book tour that I can't cancel,
so just make it happen, all right?</i>

48
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:53,188
<i>Love you, bye!</i>

49
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:13,726
<i>We have to keep going.</i>

50
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,247
Let's see what's on the
other side of that door.

51
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,456
But what if
there isn't anything?

52
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:22,286
There's only one way
to find out.

53
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:25,117
Then Lovemore realized

54
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,498
the treasure she wanted
was lost forever

55
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:29,984
and her adventures
were coming to an end.

56
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:31,226
That doesn't feel right.

57
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,125
Yeah, but that's it.

58
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:34,678
That's the end.

59
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:45,275
Well, John,

60
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:46,966
here I go.

61
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,348
<i>Dulcius ex asperis.</i>

62
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:58,633
- Okay, honey, it's showtime.
- Are you sure about this?

63
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:02,326
Because I have a wedgie in the back
and in the front in this thing.

64
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,673
I feel like
a nerdy figure skater.

65
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,469
- Sexy. Stunner. I'm all about it.
- No, it's not. It's not.

66
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:09,506
- How do I move in this?
- Don't touch it.

67
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:11,818
- I'm not touching it. I'm holding it out.
- Stop it. Will you stop?

68
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:14,097
Get it out now 'cause you
can't do that onstage.

69
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,892
And we're done.
And we're done. Okay, good.

70
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:18,894
Do I need to be wearing
a glitter onesie?

71
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:20,448
You only have to wear this
for two hours.

72
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,519
Do not mess this up, do you hear me?
This is on loan.

73
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:24,624
Everyone's wearing
sequins right now.

74
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:28,214
- Why is she taking my photo?
- This is Allison.

75
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:30,630
She is our new
social media manager.

76
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:33,564
And she's gonna be helping us
target that younger demographic.

77
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:36,153
Meaning women in their 30s
who wish they were in their 20s.

78
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:37,775
Hey, what's up?

79
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,227
Um, I took over your socials,
so this morning you tweeted,

80
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:46,508
"Where are my ladies at?
Meet me at Ballroom G at 5:00 p.m.

81
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:48,062
#ShawnMendes.

82
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:51,030
#GaggingToMeetYouAll."

83
00:04:51,134 --> 00:04:53,688
Okay, we are having fun.
Let's go.

84
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,760
We need to remind people
that you are still alive.

85
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,279
People know I'm alive.

86
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,350
And to remind them
why this used to be

87
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:02,524
- the best selling franchise.
- In Romance.

88
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:05,251
Yes, which is the top
revenue-generating literary category.

89
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:08,220
Revenue-generating isn't how I would
describe our presales right now.

90
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:10,463
Just think of this as a way
that uses word of mouth.

91
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,189
Oh, you want word of mouth?
Here we go. How's this?

92
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:15,089
"The only thing more lost than
the city is the author herself."

93
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,952
"Loveless."
"Passionless."

94
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:20,956
Uh, "Way past her prime." And, oh,
"This is fake history at its worst."

95
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,235
A book tour could
change everything, okay?

96
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:25,651
We have to remind the fans
why they love you so much.

97
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:29,344
Real history. I merely season
it with a smidge more nudity.

98
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:31,657
History had a ton of nudity.

99
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,591
<i>Deep exploration.</i>

100
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:37,180
<i>Steamy wondering.</i>

101
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:42,323
<i>Will Lovemore and Dash find Queen
Taha's priceless Crown of Fire?</i>

102
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,221
<i>Join them on their search.</i>

103
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:46,258
So, listen, I wanted to
talk to you about something.

104
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:47,604
There's so many people.

105
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:49,847
I know how much you hate
doing these things,

106
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,678
so I've invited Alan to do
the Q and A with you today.

107
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:54,783
- What?
- And the rest of the book tour.

108
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,855
Beth, I expressly asked not to do any
more events with Dash... Alan, Alan!

109
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,789
- He's gonna humiliate me.
- He's not gonna humiliate you.

110
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,930
Thank you. You're very good at your job.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

111
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:05,242
Let me help you with that.

112
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:07,244
He is... He's
a body wash commercial.

113
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:09,212
He's always glistening
all over the place.

114
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:12,215
There hasn't been an event where
his shirt didn't come flying off.

115
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:13,837
- You wish.
- Well, he's already here,

116
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,081
so put on your big-girl panties
and let's get out there.

117
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:19,360
Remember, no grumpy face,
big words or boring academic talk.

118
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,742
Yes! Yes!

119
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:24,779
Come on, RTP!

120
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:26,367
Ha-ha!

121
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,714
Yes, my Lovemore-heads!

122
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:32,269
I am so excited
to introduce to you

123
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:36,204
the award-winning author,
Loretta Sage!

124
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:38,862
- Beth, I can't do this. I'm not ready.
- Are you kidding me?

125
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,691
Listen, I've got your back.
You got this.

126
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:42,314
Go give the people
what they want.

127
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,281
- It's not me they want.
- Get out there now!

128
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:50,667
Hi. How are you?
Nice to see you. Thank you.

129
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:57,743
Yep. Mount it.

130
00:07:00,194 --> 00:07:03,093
Mount it. Mount it.
Okay.

131
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:04,888
Find your center.

132
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,547
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

133
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,411
- The sexiest...
- All right!

134
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:14,518
...most influential hero
of a generation.

135
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:15,830
That's a bit strong.

136
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:18,557
His 20th cover
of an Angela Lovemore novel.

137
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:21,284
Dash McMahon!

138
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,257
Oh, my God! Dash!

139
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:54,282
- Take a bow.
- I already did mine. I did mine.

140
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:57,354
Okay, come on.
One more. I got you.

141
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:14,026
Did you guys rehearse that?
Oh, my God.

142
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:17,961
I'm loving this chemistry between you
two, and I got to say,

143
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,205
I love this book.

144
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:21,378
- Oh, thank you, Ray.
- Thank...

145
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:22,828
Spoiler alert.

146
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:24,209
A really bold choice

147
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:26,245
to not have them go
into the tomb at the end.

148
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:27,971
Talk about
what went into this one.

149
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,526
I mean, this one's such a
special book for me personally.

150
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,460
I... I don't know how to say
how much it means to me

151
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:36,669
that Loretta,
word writer extraordinaire,

152
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:39,810
has, you know,
named the book after me.

153
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:41,743
<i>The Lost City of Dash.</i>

154
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:42,951
<i>The Lost City of D.</i>

155
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,299
Um, but that's not what
the D stands for.

156
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:47,991
- It's D for "dick," right?
- No dick, no.

157
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,201
It's based on the name of an ancient
tribe, Dapocagihou-dysphem-ica.

158
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:55,861
And, um, it was too difficult for
the European colonizers to pronounce,

159
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:59,244
- so, in true colonial fashion they abbreviated it.
- No one cares about this.

160
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:01,073
That's so interesting.
Okay.

161
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,489
How about we take some
questions from the audience?

162
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:05,388
- Right here, handsome!
- Yes.

163
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:09,633
- Dash, what's your favorite romantic moment?
- Ooh.

164
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:14,259
What I would really like to know is what
is Loretta's favorite romantic moment?

165
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:16,295
Ooh, spicy.

166
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,332
Oh, uh...

167
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:21,127
Well, being a sapiosexual...

168
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:23,440
Oh, is that when they do
the snakes around the...

169
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:27,617
No. That's someone
who finds, uh, intellect

170
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,621
or intelligence,
uh, very sexy, you know.

171
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:32,829
Same.

172
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:34,555
Really?

173
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,074
Dash! Rip off your shirt!

174
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:40,906
No, no, no. We're not gonna do that today.
We're here for Loretta's book.

175
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:42,873
Do we have questions
for Loretta?

176
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:48,154
Uh, yes, studious-looking young lady?
What would you like to ask me?

177
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:50,295
Can you rip off Dash's shirt?

178
00:09:51,848 --> 00:09:54,678
No, no. We're not gonna
do this again. Sorry.

179
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:57,302
Rip it off! Rip it off!

180
00:09:57,405 --> 00:09:59,718
Rip it off! Rip it off!
Rip it off!

181
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:03,549
Of course. Of course, yes.
Can do.

182
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:05,793
Is this happening?

183
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,622
- You don't have to do this.
- Oh, we have to.

184
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:09,797
We have to give the people
what they want. Yes, yes.

185
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,627
We have to give the people
what they want, yes.

186
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:15,975
Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy.

187
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,739
<i>Because The Lost City of D
is Dash's final adventure.</i>

188
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:22,913
If there even is a next book,

189
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:26,123
it will open with Lovemore
receiving the tragic news

190
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:28,574
of his untimely death.

191
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:30,058
What?

192
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,612
- Shit. I'm sorry. My smartwatch is stuck.
- Ow. Hold on.

193
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:32,785
I know. Don't pull it.

194
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,408
It's okay. Just be real still.

195
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:35,926
- No. That's pulling it.
- You're pulling it.

196
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,619
You're gonna rip my wig off.
No, you can't...

197
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:44,003
Oh, my!

198
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:45,522
- Oh, my God.
- Is he okay?

199
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:47,248
God, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

200
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:50,009
- I'm so sorry.
- You're a bad person.

201
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:54,359
Stick around for the
costume contest at 6:00 p.m.

202
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,465
"If there is another book"?

203
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:02,470
I'm investing everything we've
got into this tour, okay?

204
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:06,025
I just don't think I have another
Dash and Lovemore adventure in me.

205
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:07,510
How does Dash die?

206
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:09,753
- Was it the snakes?
- No.

207
00:11:09,857 --> 00:11:12,204
Okay, so I have something
that I have to take care of.

208
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:14,758
You guys have an interview in
the next suite in ten minutes.

209
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:17,278
So can you please do me a favor
and be grown-ups

210
00:11:17,382 --> 00:11:18,900
and get yourselves there
on your own?

211
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:20,212
Okay. Thank you so much.

212
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:23,077
Does he die from
a staph infection?

213
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,115
It is a staph infection.
I knew it.

214
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,670
I-I... All right.

215
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,845
Look, I get it if you
need a break or something,

216
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:34,951
- but you can't just kill me, okay?
- Okay.

217
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:39,438
I hate that I have to ask this,
but you do know you're not Dash, right?

218
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:41,716
Dash is a character I made up.

219
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,062
Dash?

220
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:47,135
Thanks.

221
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,447
Thank you.

222
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:53,210
- Loretta, it's this way.
- No, I think it's this way.

223
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:55,661
Can't you see that Dash
means so much to people?

224
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,629
- Means so much to you.
- Not to me.

225
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:59,389
Well, yeah, to me,
but to other people too.

226
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:02,461
- What about Beth?
- You know what? Beth is gonna be fine.

227
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:06,396
She's gonna find plenty fresh,
young writers full of great ideas.

228
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,502
You can transition gracefully

229
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:10,952
into the shirt-on phase
of your modeling career,

230
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:12,402
and I can be left alone.

231
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,231
Everybody is happy.

232
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:16,130
No, it's this way.

233
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,063
Beth says you don't even
leave the house anymore.

234
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,203
I don't feel like
that's very happy.

235
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,206
You should be going out in the world,
filling yourself up on new experiences.

236
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,553
I'm already filled up.
I'm full. I'm fully satiated.

237
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:29,005
Why would you want to be stuck at home
alone when you could see the world?

238
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,627
You could be visiting
ancient Greece.

239
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:33,630
Okay. How could I visit
ancient Greece?

240
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:35,770
I get it. Because
you're afraid of flying.

241
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:39,291
No. Because ancient Greece
is in the past.

242
00:12:39,394 --> 00:12:40,948
Just like Dash.

243
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,261
Okay. You want to know who else
is stuck in the past? You are.

244
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:47,126
You're so afraid of life hurting you
again that you've stopped living.

245
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,543
You're like a human mummy.

246
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:53,063
I didn't, um...

247
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,514
Oh.

248
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:57,758
Mummies are human.

249
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:09,010
Stupid... Oh, crap.

250
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,048
I'm so sorry.
I-I will clean this up.

251
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:14,637
I am not a litterer,
I-I assure you that.

252
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,226
Do you, um... Do you think you
could, uh, call a car for me, please?

253
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,849
Thank you. Thank you.

254
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,784
Bring the car around.

255
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,337
God, is that someone's retainer?

256
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,788
I've never said the right thing
one time around her.

257
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,824
I get nervous
because she opens her mouth,

258
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:34,380
and just an encyclopedia of beautifulness
comes out, and I just never say...

259
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:35,796
You know
she's trying to kill me?

260
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,074
I just need those tomatoes.

261
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:40,525
You're right.
No, you're right.

262
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:42,112
I should apologize.
Thank you, man.

263
00:13:42,216 --> 00:13:44,459
- I appreciate that very, very much.
- You're welcome.

264
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:56,886
Uh, Loretta Sage. Yeah.

265
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:03,202
Uh...

266
00:14:04,514 --> 00:14:05,722
Hiya.

267
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:07,310
Uh, I did not order an UberPool.

268
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,382
Someone wants to meet you.
We'll have you right back.

269
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:11,659
Um...

270
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,422
Loretta!

271
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:18,045
Loretta! Loretta?

272
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,808
Uh, Loretta?

273
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:25,500
- Did you say "Loretta"?
- Yeah.

274
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:26,812
- Follow that SUV, man.
- No.

275
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,676
- Come on, please!
- No, no, no.

276
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,852
I'm not helping any more handsome
strangers. Fool me once. Mm-mmm.

277
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,269
<i>What is this, Taken? Am I "tooken"?</i>

278
00:14:35,372 --> 00:14:36,788
Am I sold already?

279
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:39,894
Am I...
Am I sold to him?

280
00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:43,657
- Ow. Stop.
- Oh, no. Did this feel creepy?

281
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,383
I said
don't make it creepy, guys.

282
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,316
I'm so sorry about the setting.

283
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,009
I just flew in.
I was in a real panic to meet you.

284
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:53,183
I didn't have time
to dress the place up much.

285
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:56,083
I read you love cheese,
so I just got them all.

286
00:14:56,186 --> 00:15:00,259
Are you the one who's been
emailing me for photos of my feet?

287
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:02,227
No. Um...

288
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,645
And I promise what I'm about to show
you is gonna make you very happy.

289
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:08,613
But first, a little bit

290
00:15:08,716 --> 00:15:11,926
about the mysterious rogue
you see before you.

291
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,308
Uh, my name is Abigail Fairfax.

292
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:17,345
- Abigail?
- It's a gender-neutral name, like Leslie or Beverly.

293
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,142
Yes, but you're Abigail Fairfax
of the media-mogul Fairfaxes?

294
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:25,284
Didn't you just
take over your company or...

295
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:29,323
No, that was my brother, actually.
That was Leslie. We're all very proud.

296
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:32,533
Ah. Yes, I should say so,
at such a young age to...

297
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:34,569
Some might even say too young.

298
00:15:34,673 --> 00:15:37,400
But that world
never really interested me.

299
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,092
My passions, as you may know,

300
00:15:40,196 --> 00:15:43,302
lie in the hidden things
in the world,

301
00:15:43,406 --> 00:15:46,029
things which defy possession.

302
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:49,170
Um, some might call me
a collector.

303
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:52,967
But there is one obsession
in particular

304
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:55,176
that has held me captive.

305
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,834
The Crown of Fire

306
00:15:57,938 --> 00:16:00,319
and its cascading red diamonds.

307
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:04,082
Is this a... Is this
a hidden-camera thing?

308
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:07,775
So imagine my surprise
when, in your new book,

309
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:11,158
amidst the pages
of coital reverie,

310
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,090
was something...

311
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:14,264
- Oh, God.
- ...quite magnificent.

312
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:18,683
I get it. I get it.
I so get it right now.

313
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:20,098
Oh, my gosh.

314
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:22,376
I literally thought
you guys kidnapped me.

315
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,965
I mean, this is marketing, right?
Beth set this up?

316
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,968
This was so good, you guys.
This was amazing.

317
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:31,316
You, with your gun
and your mustache

318
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:34,388
and your, "You'd better get
in there" and you know...

319
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:37,115
Oh, my God.

320
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:40,981
You, with the G.I.
Joe tone-on-tone outfit.

321
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:46,089
Your fictional archaeologist was making
real translations of a dead language.

322
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:49,092
- Mm-hmm.
- Something nobody else has been able to do.

323
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:51,612
Well, nobody else
had ever tried.

324
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,545
Is that right?
Am I saying the right thing?

325
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:55,305
Except you, right?

326
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:57,376
Except me!

327
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,206
Yes. See, it turns out

328
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,623
Loretta Sage was once a young
college girl doing her dissertation

329
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:05,591
on the dead language of the D
with her future husband,

330
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:08,802
dreaming of finding Kalaman's
tomb and the Crown of Fire.

331
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:12,012
I was sorry to read you gave
up your search after he died.

332
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,738
But what that means is,

333
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:16,913
you're all I have left.

334
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:20,192
All-All you have left
for... what?

335
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:21,331
Hmm.

336
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,369
Oh.

337
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:25,853
Here we go.

338
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,696
What is this?

339
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,493
I believe it is describing the
exact location of Kalaman's tomb,

340
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:49,049
in which Taha and her
priceless headdress are buried.

341
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,292
Well, if this were authentic,

342
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:56,746
you would still have to
uncover an entire city

343
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,887
that nobody
has been able to find.

344
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,647
I found it.

345
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:04,892
On a tiny, forgotten island in
the Atlantic called Isla Hundida.

346
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:08,551
What I have not been able to find
is Kalaman's final resting place.

347
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,935
This piece of parchment is the
only clue we found among the ruins.

348
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,179
I need someone
who can decipher these symbols.

349
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:18,354
I need you.

350
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:20,943
- Well...
- Miss Sage,

351
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:24,429
surely this isn't how
you want your story to end.

352
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:27,121
We both had our dreams crushed
by bad luck,

353
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:29,468
or in my case,
an arse-kissing little brother,

354
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:32,678
but this is our chance
to show them all.

355
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:34,370
Come with me...
to the island.

356
00:18:34,473 --> 00:18:39,616
Translate these symbols and
help me find the Crown of Fire.

357
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,343
You can name your price.

358
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:47,797
I must respectfully decline.

359
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:53,872
Well...

360
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:57,462
I can't say
I'm not disappointed.

361
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,845
But I understand how you feel.

362
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:05,953
Will you at least let us
give you a ride?

363
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:10,337
Oh, no, thank you.
I'll call for my own car, and I'll just...

364
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,672
I don't feel like you're listening
to me. This is urgent, and we...

365
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:38,710
Okay, so the police are saying
that they put out an APB...

366
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,470
- APB.
- ...on an SUV,

367
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:42,817
- and there's this 24-hour rule...
- Why is there a rule?

368
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:45,337
- ...and they won't do anything until...
- What about the FBI or the CIA?

369
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:47,408
- They said to call the police.
- I'm sure Loretta's fine.

370
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:50,101
When I was in college,
my friend Nicki went missing.

371
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:51,826
Everyone was, like,
freaking out.

372
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,277
But then she was just
in her car.

373
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:57,556
She was dead, but we found her.
She wasn't gone.

374
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,009
Um, what about...
Maybe we could get a PI

375
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,632
or, like, you know,
private security or...

376
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,634
What about an extraction team,
like the movie?

377
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,223
Yes! But who does that?
The ex-military, right?

378
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:11,916
Oh, yeah. I think I actually
have somebody that could help us.

379
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:14,988
- Oh.
- I did this meditation retreat,

380
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,162
and there was this
trainer guy there.

381
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:18,784
You should
see this guy meditate.

382
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:20,303
But he's ex-Navy SEAL.

383
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:24,204
He... He's a special ops trainer.
What was his name?

384
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:26,033
Yeah. Jack Trainer.

385
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:27,759
So he's a trainer
named Jack Trainer?

386
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:30,037
That's how I have everybody in my phone.
See, "Janice Mom."

387
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,590
"Larry Doorknob."
"Stacy Butt Stuff."

388
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:34,386
Look, this is what this guy does.
He finds people.

389
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,768
If there's anybody
that can help us, it's him.

390
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:46,226
<i>- Jack Trainer.
- Oh, so his name is actually Jack Trainer.</i>

391
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:50,230
Hi, uh, this is Alan
from "Touching Your Inner Self."

392
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:53,543
The meditation retreat?

393
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:58,341
Anyway, uh, okay.
Our friend Loretta has been kidnapped,

394
00:20:58,445 --> 00:20:59,894
and no one's helping us.

395
00:20:59,998 --> 00:21:01,482
<i>How long she been missing?</i>

396
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:02,828
Maybe two hours now.

397
00:21:02,932 --> 00:21:04,244
<i>Who is that?</i>

398
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:08,386
Um, this is B...
This is Beth. I'm Beth.

399
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:10,905
And Allison is on too, sir.

400
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:13,218
<i>Did she have any
Wi-Fi-enabled devices?</i>

401
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:16,221
- She's got her phone, right?
- No, I have her phone.

402
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:18,948
Oh! She has a smartwatch.
It ripped my wig off.

403
00:21:19,052 --> 00:21:21,986
<i>What was that scenario?
Never mind. Open the phone.</i>

404
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,642
<i>- Go to the smartwatch app.
- All right.</i>

405
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:26,059
<i>Then hit "Find My Smartwatch."</i>

406
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:29,096
Oh, my... That is so good.
That's why we called.

407
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,650
<i>"Anticipate the difficult
by managing the easy."</i>

408
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:35,447
<i>- Is that Oprah or Deepak?
- Laozi from Tao-te Ching.</i>

409
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:36,759
Oh, my God.

410
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,554
It's in the Atlantic.

411
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:41,005
- She's on a plane?
- How can you tell that?

412
00:21:41,108 --> 00:21:43,283
'Cause she can't swim that fast.

413
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,836
<i>Doesn't sound
like a ransom scenario.</i>

414
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:47,563
<i>My guess is blood sport,
Hunger Games type situation.</i>

415
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,497
<i>Possibly some coke-fueled
dark web scavenger hunt.</i>

416
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,637
<i>Real clown shit.
We'll have to move fast.</i>

417
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,674
<i>- How do we pay you?
- Cryptocurrency. Cash App.</i>

418
00:21:55,778 --> 00:21:59,264
<i>I'll have her back within 48
hours or your next rescue is free.</i>

419
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:00,852
How many people
need a next rescue?

420
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:02,474
More than you'd think.

421
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:04,407
<i>- I'm gonna need that phone.
- I'll bring it to you.</i>

422
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:07,272
<i>Let me know where she lands.
I'll meet you there, Alan.</i>

423
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,323
Hello.

424
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,053
Where am I?

425
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:31,158
Um, you're on my plane.

426
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:32,470
It's nice, isn't it? Hmm?

427
00:22:32,573 --> 00:22:34,403
The seats are made of
mama llama leather.

428
00:22:34,506 --> 00:22:37,613
Well, I'm getting off
your plane.

429
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:39,097
Unchain me!

430
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:40,754
That's your seat belt.

431
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:43,205
Did you chloroform me?

432
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,517
People actually do that?

433
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,557
Well, you know,
it's a classic for a reason.

434
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:52,490
My body feels drunk.

435
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:54,492
It'll wear off in a bit.
I am sorry.

436
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:57,011
I just couldn't wait around
for you to change your mind.

437
00:22:57,115 --> 00:22:59,566
- Stop playing jelly.
- Time is not on our side.

438
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,396
You see, the volcano
we're excavating around

439
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,467
has developed
a bad case of indigestion.

440
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:06,435
I'm rather worried that when it blows,

441
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:08,609
everything that's left of the
Lost City will be destroyed.

442
00:23:08,713 --> 00:23:10,611
Oh, my God.
My legs don't work.

443
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:16,134
So, this is our last chance to
find both the tomb and the crown.

444
00:23:16,238 --> 00:23:18,274
- Oh, God.
- Oh!

445
00:23:18,378 --> 00:23:20,656
Don't worry.
That's just our final descent.

446
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,765
But it is the beginning of the
greatest adventure of your life.

447
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:37,457
Welcome to the Lost City.

448
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:48,502
How did you find it?

449
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:50,746
So, the city was built
on a lava dome.

450
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:53,542
As the volcano became active,
the dome filled with lava,

451
00:24:53,645 --> 00:24:56,269
and sunken things
rose to the surface.

452
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:58,271
The D exposed itself.

453
00:24:58,374 --> 00:25:01,412
- The entire city?
- No, no. Just the tip.

454
00:25:01,515 --> 00:25:04,725
As soon as I heard rumors of the ruins,
I flew over and bought the place.

455
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:08,108
- The site?
- No. The island. The southern half.

456
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:10,559
I got a good deal 'cause
this is where the lava flows.

457
00:25:10,662 --> 00:25:12,906
We've been excavating
for a year now.

458
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:16,530
One doesn't kidnap a
romance novelist on day one.

459
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:18,670
Ah, yes, as the saying goes.

460
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:21,777
Rafi doesn't like it.
Do you, Rafi?

461
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,056
He says we're
disrespecting his heritage.

462
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,404
But not a lot of other job options
on the island, are there, Rafi?

463
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:30,579
Beggars can't be choosers.

464
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,246
No more charcuterie, I take it.

465
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:44,455
Mmm. Please.
I'm not a monster.

466
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:46,388
Whatever you need, just shout.

467
00:25:47,906 --> 00:25:52,773
Uh, leave one hand free.
She has some translating to do.

468
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:55,224
And then what?

469
00:25:55,328 --> 00:25:57,847
Loretta, I really wish
you would try and see

470
00:25:57,951 --> 00:26:00,091
what an exciting opportunity
this is for us.

471
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:04,095
I believe this text describes
the exact location of the tomb.

472
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:06,718
It's a logographic system.

473
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:10,066
Like cuneiform or hieroglyphics.

474
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,967
Now, if you have other documents
that possibly I can compare...

475
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,348
Yeah, no luck there.

476
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:18,247
We found some scratching
at a nearby waterfall,

477
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:19,248
but it was useless.

478
00:26:19,352 --> 00:26:20,905
Just pictures of women.

479
00:26:21,008 --> 00:26:25,599
Look, I, too, wish your dear
old dead archaeologist husband

480
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:28,430
was here to help,
but he's not, so,

481
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,640
time to shine, Loretta,
sex-book writer.

482
00:26:33,055 --> 00:26:34,781
They will come for me.

483
00:26:35,368 --> 00:26:37,093
Who, exactly?

484
00:26:37,197 --> 00:26:38,923
Your... Your many cats?

485
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:40,821
Oh, I don't have cats.

486
00:26:41,408 --> 00:26:43,237
Somehow even more sad.

487
00:26:43,341 --> 00:26:46,310
I have a hamster, asshole!

488
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:48,070
You have a hamster's asshole?

489
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,936
No, there was a...
there was a comma between... Forget it.

490
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,457
I bet your brother never had
to kidnap anyone!

491
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,785
Good to see you, man.

492
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:49,511
- Phone.
- Right.

493
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:02,627
What?

494
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:05,319
Yeah, I was thinking
that I could, you know,

495
00:28:05,423 --> 00:28:07,011
maybe just sort of
come with you.

496
00:28:07,114 --> 00:28:08,875
- Why?
- To help.

497
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:13,120
I know CPR. I know some light karate.
CrossFit certified.

498
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,743
Okay, okay, listen, listen!

499
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:17,297
I just... It's my fault.

500
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:19,506
Not the kidnapping and stuff,

501
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,682
but, like, I said some really mean
stuff to her, and I regret it,

502
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:24,408
and I just need to take it back.

503
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:25,892
I called her a human mummy.

504
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,653
Mummies are human.

505
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:31,725
I'm aware of that now, yes.

506
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:34,866
That is true.

507
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:35,971
Please.

508
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,940
All right, Alan,
I can't be responsible for you.

509
00:28:40,907 --> 00:28:41,908
Okay. Yeah.

510
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,980
- I need you to stay in the car.
- Yeah.

511
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:47,189
- In the car.
- In the car.

512
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,743
- The whole time.
- The whole time?

513
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:51,089
Whole time.

514
00:28:51,193 --> 00:28:52,436
Mm-hmm.

515
00:28:54,196 --> 00:28:55,473
Yes!

516
00:29:02,411 --> 00:29:03,757
This is me.

517
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,933
Really? Is this what
the SEAL teams use?

518
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,694
"Only a fool chooses a horse
by its color."

519
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:12,594
<i>Right, right.
The Tao-te Ching?</i>

520
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:15,838
No, it was on the sign
back there at the rental place.

521
00:29:24,364 --> 00:29:25,572
Thank you.

522
00:29:58,398 --> 00:29:59,848
What? What?

523
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,093
I was hoping to invite you
to breakfast,

524
00:30:04,197 --> 00:30:06,855
but it looks like
you still have work to do.

525
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:09,582
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

526
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:11,204
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

527
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:13,309
I believe this says

528
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:15,415
"rest" or "resting."

529
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,418
So it would be,
"Kalaman and his treasure..."

530
00:30:18,522 --> 00:30:23,009
And then there are some missing
pieces, and then "rest," "resting,"

531
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:26,530
and something about
"tears," so...

532
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:29,325
Resting where?

533
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:30,637
Hmm? Oh!

534
00:30:30,741 --> 00:30:33,502
Didn't say.
It doesn't say.

535
00:30:34,848 --> 00:30:37,851
Miss Sage,
I need you to do better.

536
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:41,406
Then next time maybe don't
kidnap a romance novelist, hmm?

537
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,719
My God,
this shouldn't be this hard!

538
00:30:43,823 --> 00:30:45,756
It is not some pauper's grave
we're looking for.

539
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:48,137
It is a monument to a great man!

540
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:50,174
King Kalaman was ambitious,
he was powerful,

541
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:52,728
he was the first man to
build a city in the Atlantic.

542
00:30:52,832 --> 00:30:55,489
The eyes of his subjects
would have turned to him.

543
00:30:55,593 --> 00:30:58,838
He would have had a pyramid,
a ziggurat, a tower

544
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,909
to hold his Crown of Fire.

545
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:03,912
All I need to know
is where it is.

546
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:07,260
I don't know if you recall,
but you only said translate it.

547
00:31:07,363 --> 00:31:09,503
I-I translated it.

548
00:31:10,297 --> 00:31:11,885
Translate it again.

549
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:20,549
One day, we're gonna laugh about this.

550
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:22,793
Such an adventure we're having.

551
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:30,248
I should go with you,
just for backup and awesomeness.

552
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:32,872
This is pretty awesome.

553
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,633
You got nature, the radio.

554
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:40,396
Yeah, you're right, but it's
very, very important to me

555
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,364
that she knows
that I came to rescue her.

556
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,159
Why?
Do you like this woman?

557
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,369
No, I just brought snacks
and stuff.

558
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,647
And she gets a little grumpy
when she's hungry.

559
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:53,168
Blood pressure drops. And I get that
because I'm a five-meal-a-day kind of guy.

560
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:56,067
Do you keto, by the way?
You look like you keto.

561
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:57,862
- No.
- No. Yeah.

562
00:31:57,966 --> 00:31:59,692
You don't need it.

563
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:01,279
What is it?

564
00:32:01,383 --> 00:32:04,973
I just want her to think of me
as more than a cover model.

565
00:32:05,076 --> 00:32:09,322
But, Alan, you are so much more.
You're my lookout.

566
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:12,774
Okay, can I at least do the part
where I put her in the car

567
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:16,605
and I just go,
"Shh. You're safe now"?

568
00:32:17,675 --> 00:32:19,677
Sure, champ.
She'll love that.

569
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:21,645
Oh, you're just going?
Going to start?

570
00:32:21,748 --> 00:32:24,164
You're starting
the mission now? Okay.

571
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:50,570
Oh!

572
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:01,098
Go to sleep.

573
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,059
- Alan.
- What?

574
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:32,923
This is a breach of trust, Alan.

575
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:34,579
I can help. Let me help.

576
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:40,620
Stay close. Stay alive.

577
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:46,730
Hey.

578
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:53,184
Go to sleep.

579
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:59,673
I got his head. What do I do with his head?
I'm just gonna set him down.

580
00:34:05,818 --> 00:34:07,026
No.

581
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:08,786
Hey, hey, no!

582
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,098
No, no, no!

583
00:34:17,657 --> 00:34:19,486
Ooh, yeah! Ooh.

584
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,556
Ow.

585
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,213
Teamwork, yeah!

586
00:34:22,317 --> 00:34:25,596
Great effort, Alan, but that man
was already unconscious.

587
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,391
I was already wound up.

588
00:34:28,323 --> 00:34:31,084
Just don't do it when I'm...

589
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:35,433
Hi.

590
00:34:37,677 --> 00:34:39,403
Oh!

591
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,302
On your seven!

592
00:34:47,238 --> 00:34:48,308
Oh!

593
00:34:53,106 --> 00:34:55,039
Trainer, he's not asleep!

594
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:57,317
Stay... Stay down. Stay down.

595
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:02,495
- You're doing great.
- Thanks.

596
00:35:02,598 --> 00:35:04,117
Where you going?

597
00:35:07,086 --> 00:35:09,605
What?

598
00:35:12,263 --> 00:35:13,747
Loretta Sage?

599
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:15,025
Yes.

600
00:35:15,128 --> 00:35:16,992
I'm getting you out of here.

601
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:21,065
- Why are you so handsome?
- My dad was a weatherman.

602
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:24,103
A-Alan?

603
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,243
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?

604
00:35:26,346 --> 00:35:29,142
- Uh, irregardless, I'm here to save you.
- That's not...

605
00:35:29,246 --> 00:35:31,489
- I think he meant "regardless."
- Yes.

606
00:35:32,905 --> 00:35:36,874
Ooh, uh, does she need saving in there,
Trainer? I think she's fine there.

607
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:40,153
No, no, leave it. Don't take their stuff.
They'll come after us.

608
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:44,364
Alan, why do you
keep doing that?

609
00:35:44,468 --> 00:35:46,435
Why do you keep doing that?
I had that one.

610
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:49,059
It's just getting mean now.
It's unnecessary.

611
00:35:49,162 --> 00:35:50,923
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to get one in.

612
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:54,098
- Excuse me. Would it be possible to remove me from the chair?
- No time.

613
00:35:54,202 --> 00:35:56,618
No time? There's been so much chitchat.

614
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,033
We should definitely go.

615
00:35:58,137 --> 00:35:59,759
Let's go! Let's go!

616
00:36:25,612 --> 00:36:26,751
Why are things exploding?

617
00:36:34,414 --> 00:36:35,450
I got...

618
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:38,315
Okay.

619
00:36:39,212 --> 00:36:40,489
Shh...

620
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:42,491
Shh. You're safe now.

621
00:36:42,595 --> 00:36:43,734
You're...

622
00:36:43,837 --> 00:36:45,978
How... How are you so calm?

623
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:48,566
- That was my... That was my line.
- Here.

624
00:36:50,706 --> 00:36:52,605
- What?
- Is that Reiki?

625
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:55,159
- Are you healing me?
- I think so.

626
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:58,473
- Ah.
- As Laozi says, "To the mind that is still..."

627
00:36:58,576 --> 00:37:01,476
- "...the whole universe surrenders."
- Hey, yeah, I know some...

628
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:04,375
I know some, um,
quotes that could be good for this moment.

629
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:06,205
<i>In omnia paratus.</i>

630
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:08,966
"Ready for anything."

631
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,727
Maybe we shouldn't be just staring
lovingly into each other's eyes

632
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:15,283
like you're gonna fall in love
like I'm not here.

633
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:16,801
Who are you?

634
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:19,632
Just a guy trying to do his job.

635
00:37:19,735 --> 00:37:22,531
And right now, that job
is to get this lovely lady...

636
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,878
Oh! Oh.

637
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:26,880
Oh, God. Okay.

638
00:37:28,054 --> 00:37:30,263
No. What is happening?

639
00:37:33,715 --> 00:37:35,682
Okay. What do we do?

640
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,891
We need to do... I can't see.

641
00:37:37,995 --> 00:37:39,410
I don't like it!

642
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:40,998
Here. Here!

643
00:37:41,102 --> 00:37:43,552
- Why would you throw a gun?
- Seriously?

644
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:47,763
- Get me out of the chair.
- I can't. We don't have time.

645
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:53,390
Gotta squeeze!
You got to do a Kegel or something!

646
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:55,875
- Kegel it!
- What do you think a Kegel is?

647
00:37:55,979 --> 00:37:58,360
I'm not in it, not in!
Still not in!

648
00:37:58,464 --> 00:38:00,845
- You got to go in more.
- Stop. Stop. Stop it!

649
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,951
Oh, oh, oh!

650
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:06,575
Oh, God. Get in the car, get in the car!
Start the car! Start the car!

651
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,956
- Go, go.
- Move your leg.

652
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,372
- Which one?
- Both of them! Move them!

653
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:16,102
- Forward, forward!
- Okay. Okay.

654
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:20,520
- I'm going! I'm going! Okay!
- Drive!

655
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:25,284
Shh. You're safe now. Shh.

656
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,321
Ow.

657
00:38:28,425 --> 00:38:30,565
- Shh. You're safe now.
- No, I'm not. Not safe.

658
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:32,429
Oh, no, am I bleeding?

659
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:35,535
- I don't think that's yours.
- Oh, no, that's a lot of blood.

660
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,676
Cheese and rice!

661
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,264
- Are those his brains?
- What?

662
00:38:40,368 --> 00:38:42,335
I think his brains
are on my face!

663
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:46,063
Definitely his brains are in my mouth.
I can taste his thoughts!

664
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:47,375
Focus on the road.

665
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:49,618
He just liked
training people. Trainer.

666
00:38:49,722 --> 00:38:52,587
- What are you talking about?
- He loved me.

667
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,279
Can you just scooch the car
over to the left?

668
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:59,111
- Get it off. Get it off.
- Oh, God.

669
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:00,491
Watch out!

670
00:39:04,702 --> 00:39:07,602
Oh! Oh! Oh!

671
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:11,606
Oh, did you see...

672
00:39:14,574 --> 00:39:15,610
No.

673
00:39:21,029 --> 00:39:22,341
Oh.

674
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,103
Oh, no. Oh, no.

675
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,140
Oh, no.

676
00:39:36,562 --> 00:39:38,115
Oh, no.

677
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:40,600
Alan?

678
00:39:40,704 --> 00:39:44,294
Oh, holy Christmas.
Are you okay? Are you okay?

679
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:46,468
Do you think you could
get me out of here?

680
00:39:46,572 --> 00:39:48,125
Yeah. Okay.

681
00:39:48,229 --> 00:39:51,128
- You just flew out of the car.
- I did. I did, indeed.

682
00:39:51,232 --> 00:39:52,681
Okay. I got you.
I got you.

683
00:39:52,785 --> 00:39:55,236
Can you get me out of the chair?
Get me out of the chair.

684
00:39:55,339 --> 00:39:57,169
You're right.
You're right. You're right.

685
00:39:58,515 --> 00:40:00,344
- Is that... Is that a nail filer?
- Yeah.

686
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:01,932
- Can you just rip it?
- It's working.

687
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:03,830
And maybe next time
I toss a gun at you,

688
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,832
you can catch it
instead of ducking.

689
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:09,146
How about the next time you toss a gun
at me, you say, "Hey, Alan, catch"?

690
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,114
Then maybe do that
before you throw it?

691
00:40:11,217 --> 00:40:13,323
Well, "here"
is a synonym for "catch."

692
00:40:13,426 --> 00:40:14,945
No, "here" is not a cinnamon
for "catch."

693
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:17,120
In a colloquial kind of way,
yes, it is.

694
00:40:17,223 --> 00:40:19,329
You say, "Here,"
I toss you a sweatshirt.

695
00:40:19,432 --> 00:40:21,434
You say, "Here,"
I toss you a pen.

696
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:24,610
How 'bout just,
"Hey! Catch! Gun!"

697
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,716
Anything that you want to throw,
I'll catch it because you said, "Catch."

698
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,580
And I'll catch it
because you said it.

699
00:40:29,684 --> 00:40:32,100
That is also an option,
and then we would have a gun with us.

700
00:40:32,204 --> 00:40:33,308
That's a thing.

701
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:35,690
- Be careful.
- Okay, we need to call...

702
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:37,450
Be careful.

703
00:40:37,554 --> 00:40:40,073
We need to call for help,
get to the airport and get out of here.

704
00:40:40,177 --> 00:40:42,179
- And I am driving.
- Okay.

705
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:47,253
Oh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh!

706
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,369
Okay, call for...
call for help.

707
00:40:59,472 --> 00:41:01,267
Where's your phone?

708
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,685
Okay.

709
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,140
- Tell me you caught them.
- I tagged the blond one.

710
00:41:13,797 --> 00:41:16,627
Oh, Loretta.

711
00:41:16,731 --> 00:41:18,802
What are you thinking?

712
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:22,012
You might've killed one of them,
but his partner's still with her.

713
00:41:22,115 --> 00:41:25,774
And he is clearly skilled,
highly trained

714
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,432
and very dangerous.

715
00:41:38,235 --> 00:41:42,308
So, Miss Sage said
she was gonna leave the event,

716
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:47,071
then got in a car
and left the event?

717
00:41:47,175 --> 00:41:49,867
- Did you try calling her?
- She doesn't have her phone.

718
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:51,386
- Stolen phone.
- Didn't say that.

719
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,250
Where's my magnifier?

720
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:55,356
Listen, can you please
help with Nana?

721
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:57,841
I don't want her hearing about Loretta
'cause it's going to upset her.

722
00:41:57,944 --> 00:42:01,016
- What about Loretta?
- Nothing, Nana. She just went on a trip.

723
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,397
- Good.
- Yeah.

724
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:04,951
That girl needed
to get out of the house.

725
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:09,232
So, this is the thing.
Loretta's phone is not stolen. I took it.

726
00:42:09,335 --> 00:42:13,788
I gave it to Alan. Alan then gave
it to the trainer, uh, Jack Trainer.

727
00:42:13,891 --> 00:42:16,169
And that is how we found
her wearable.

728
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:17,964
- And who's Alan?
- Dash.

729
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,898
- What's that?
- He's the hero in all of her books.

730
00:42:21,002 --> 00:42:24,039
- Nana. Hey, slut.
- Mm-mmm.

731
00:42:24,143 --> 00:42:27,077
Let's go in the other room and talk
about whichever war you lived through.

732
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,322
Okay. Come on, it'll be fun.
I'm sorry. It'll be fun.

733
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:32,358
Listen, Loretta Sage is missing.

734
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:34,671
When I looked at her smartwatch,
it said that she had flown

735
00:42:34,774 --> 00:42:36,431
to some island
I've never even heard about.

736
00:42:36,535 --> 00:42:38,261
That means y'all need
to do something about this.

737
00:42:38,364 --> 00:42:40,746
And if you can't, I will,
and that won't look good for you.

738
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,576
Pretty sure that's
outside our jurisdiction.

739
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,717
- You'd have to call the Feds.
- Okay.

740
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:49,202
And if you do go to the Feds,
put in a good word for me.

741
00:42:49,306 --> 00:42:51,688
- For me.
- For us.

742
00:42:57,314 --> 00:42:58,833
Oh, oh.

743
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,118
What are you gonna do,
put the car back together?

744
00:43:08,221 --> 00:43:10,431
Well... we could...

745
00:43:26,343 --> 00:43:29,035
- Where did you say the phone was?
- Passenger glove.

746
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,899
- What?
- Passenger glove compartment.

747
00:43:31,003 --> 00:43:32,245
Goodness.

748
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,869
Oh, my God.

749
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:37,216
Oh, my God. No phone, no car.
We're so gonna die out...

750
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,045
- Here.
- What is this?

751
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,806
Boots for the jungle.

752
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:43,498
It's not exactly
hiking boots, but...

753
00:43:43,602 --> 00:43:46,259
I figured your feet would be killing
you after wearing heels for this long.

754
00:43:46,363 --> 00:43:48,710
It was the best we could do.
They're Allison's. Sorry.

755
00:43:49,504 --> 00:43:51,575
Oh. Okay, well, thank you.

756
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,474
Here, oh, I got you cheese.

757
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:55,372
- Oh, my God.
- You got to stay hydrated.

758
00:43:55,476 --> 00:43:57,443
- Thank you so much.
- They didn't have glass bottles,

759
00:43:57,547 --> 00:43:59,549
so we'll definitely
hold onto it and recycle.

760
00:44:02,137 --> 00:44:06,832
Okay, so what we need to do is find a
phone, we need to call the authorities,

761
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,835
and we need to wait here until
somebody comes and rescues us.

762
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:13,459
Uh... This...
This is the rescue.

763
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:14,840
No one else is coming.

764
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,911
- I'm sorry?
- I'm the rescue.

765
00:44:17,014 --> 00:44:19,948
It was originally just gonna be me,
then I was like, Trainer should come.

766
00:44:20,052 --> 00:44:21,778
Oh, Trainer. Rest in peace.

767
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:26,127
So, our best bet is to get to the airport.
See this road right here?

768
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,923
From this area, just take a shortcut
through the jungle to the road.

769
00:44:29,026 --> 00:44:30,925
Did you just say "shortcut
through the jungle"?

770
00:44:31,028 --> 00:44:32,547
- Yeah.
- Okay, do you see us?

771
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:35,170
- Uh-huh.
- You are not Dash, and I'm not Lovemore. Okay?

772
00:44:35,274 --> 00:44:36,689
I'm Loretta, and you are Alan.

773
00:44:36,793 --> 00:44:39,105
- And jungles eat people like us, okay?
- Eat people.

774
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:42,523
And I don't want to mess up the jumpsuit.
It's on loan. So we're gonna stay put.

775
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:44,559
We're not just gonna
stand around here, okay?

776
00:44:44,663 --> 00:44:46,043
We're gonna go
through the jungle,

777
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:48,252
we're gonna go to the airport
and find a phone,

778
00:44:48,356 --> 00:44:51,359
- so you can have your cake and get what you want.
- "And eat it too"?

779
00:44:51,463 --> 00:44:53,913
If that's what you want to do
with your cake, fine. Let's go.

780
00:44:54,017 --> 00:44:55,950
- That's the only thing you do with cake.
- Not mine.

781
00:44:56,053 --> 00:44:58,504
I don't know what your people
do, but my people eat it.

782
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:00,817
You could give it
to someone as a gift.

783
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,129
Those people
are still going to eat the cake.

784
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,786
Everybody eats cake.

785
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,719
What about the kind
people jump out of?

786
00:45:06,823 --> 00:45:09,757
- They don't eat it, when they're in it.
- Oh, my God.

787
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:37,647
What did they
kidnap you for anyhow?

788
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,614
<i>Is it some weird sex stuff
like Taken?</i>

789
00:45:39,718 --> 00:45:41,271
Oh, my God, thank you.

790
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:44,101
I thought so too,
but the guy's one of the Fairfaxes.

791
00:45:44,205 --> 00:45:46,034
- Beverly?
- No, the older one.

792
00:45:46,138 --> 00:45:49,590
The really odd one that had the vlog
on finding Montezuma's treasure.

793
00:45:49,693 --> 00:45:52,109
<i>The dude that was on the news
for trying to raise the Titanic?</i>

794
00:45:52,213 --> 00:45:54,008
Yes,
he's looking for the Crown of Fire.

795
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:58,081
Wait a minute. Like the actual
Crown of Fire? Like the one...

796
00:45:58,184 --> 00:46:01,533
- So those ruins were...
- They were the Lost City of D, yes.

797
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:03,949
- What? Are you kidding me right now?
- Shh.

798
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,502
This is like your book.

799
00:46:05,606 --> 00:46:08,436
So we're basically on a Lovemore
and Dash adventure right now?

800
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,542
What is that?

801
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:13,130
What if Fairfax
actually finds the crown?

802
00:46:13,234 --> 00:46:14,615
He won't. He won't.

803
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:17,894
- Where do we go?
- Uh...

804
00:46:17,997 --> 00:46:19,965
Oh, oh, oh.

805
00:46:23,037 --> 00:46:25,177
Okay, uh, we need
to get in the water.

806
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,386
- W-What?
- We need to go by river.

807
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,319
No, no, I don't really do water.

808
00:46:29,422 --> 00:46:31,770
What do you mean, "do water"?
I'm not asking you to procreate with it.

809
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:34,324
Uh, my body and water
don't really go together.

810
00:46:34,427 --> 00:46:36,775
How do you feel about dying? Oh, God.

811
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,742
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're okay. You're okay.

812
00:46:38,846 --> 00:46:41,676
- I got you. Fine.
- I can swim. I can swim. Thank you very much.

813
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,851
- Where are you going?
- I'm crossing.

814
00:46:43,954 --> 00:46:45,922
No, we have to stay
in the water.

815
00:46:46,025 --> 00:46:48,476
<i>I researched aquatic counter-tracking
for my book, A Year in the Bush.</i>

816
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,582
They'll lose our tracks
in the water.

817
00:46:50,685 --> 00:46:53,481
Why is it warm here?
Wait, are you peeing?

818
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:55,587
Just go around it.

819
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:25,893
Okay, I think...

820
00:47:25,996 --> 00:47:27,895
I think we lost them, right?

821
00:47:27,998 --> 00:47:31,001
Yeah. That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.

822
00:47:31,105 --> 00:47:32,762
Okay, uh...

823
00:47:32,865 --> 00:47:35,281
- Don't panic.
- What do you mean, don't panic?

824
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:36,593
- Just don't panic.
- No.

825
00:47:36,697 --> 00:47:38,457
Stop saying "panic."
I'm panicking now.

826
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:40,424
You have something on your back.

827
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:42,737
No!

828
00:47:42,841 --> 00:47:44,325
- Stop screaming.
- What is that?

829
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,671
- What is that?
- Stop screaming.

830
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:47,224
- Do you have any on you?
- No. No.

831
00:47:47,328 --> 00:47:48,778
Why don't you have any on you?

832
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:50,676
Maybe the jumpsuit scared them off.
I don't know.

833
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,298
- Get 'em off.
- Oh, my God.

834
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,922
Okay. No, I can't touch
those blood-gorged mucous sacks.

835
00:47:55,025 --> 00:47:56,475
- Can you fling it?
- Right now.

836
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:57,959
- Get it.
- Just pick it and fling it.

837
00:47:58,063 --> 00:47:59,961
- Just pick it and fling it.
- You pick it and fling it!

838
00:48:00,065 --> 00:48:02,136
- Can you spin it off?
- Please, get it off.

839
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:04,276
I don't like touching it.
I'm feeling faint.

840
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:07,486
- They're sucking my soul out.
- Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop.

841
00:48:09,143 --> 00:48:11,386
Don't make that sound.

842
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:16,460
How many of them are there?

843
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:18,083
Oh, there's not many.

844
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,188
- It feels like there's so many.
- What are you...

845
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:21,604
- I feel so many.
- Oh!

846
00:48:21,707 --> 00:48:24,261
- Holy mother of God!
- Why are you praying?

847
00:48:24,365 --> 00:48:27,402
Is it that bad? It can't be that bad.
Is it that bad? How many?

848
00:48:27,506 --> 00:48:28,749
It's not great.

849
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:30,509
They're gonna suck
every bit of me out.

850
00:48:30,613 --> 00:48:33,270
Just please stop speaking.
I just need to... need to get low.

851
00:48:33,374 --> 00:48:35,100
Hold on a second.

852
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:37,999
Oh, God! I can feel them just...
they're just sucking out so much.

853
00:48:38,103 --> 00:48:40,968
I'm gonna be like a shriveled-up
skin sack when they're done.

854
00:48:41,071 --> 00:48:43,039
You cannot tell my dad
I died this way, okay?

855
00:48:43,142 --> 00:48:47,181
You gotta tell him I was wrestling an
anaconda with a sword or something.

856
00:48:47,284 --> 00:48:50,080
I'm like a blood Jamba Juice.
They're just sucking it all out.

857
00:48:50,184 --> 00:48:51,806
Why are they all
on my butt though?

858
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:54,533
Kind of like picking anchovies
off my Caesar salad.

859
00:48:54,637 --> 00:48:56,362
- It's actually not so bad.
- Anchovies?

860
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,054
Why do you go to food right now?

861
00:48:58,157 --> 00:49:01,022
Just find the queen,
and let's be done with this.

862
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:03,473
Think you're good.
I need to just check your front.

863
00:49:03,576 --> 00:49:05,820
Okay. I can't look.

864
00:49:08,064 --> 00:49:09,375
Is it bad?

865
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:12,585
- Uh, wow.
- What is it? Just say it.

866
00:49:12,689 --> 00:49:16,037
I mean, you expect it to,
you know, not...

867
00:49:16,141 --> 00:49:18,868
Then suddenly there it is,
and it is, uh...

868
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:21,215
- You know, you get excited for a person.
- What?

869
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:23,942
- I mean, I'm excited for all people.
- Why are you excited?

870
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,358
Well, you know, people
wonder, they wonder,

871
00:49:26,461 --> 00:49:28,084
but they don't know, right?

872
00:49:28,187 --> 00:49:30,673
They don't,
until suddenly they do know,

873
00:49:30,776 --> 00:49:35,091
and then they... they know
something that wasn't known before.

874
00:49:35,194 --> 00:49:37,058
Just...
Do I have any leeches or not?

875
00:49:37,162 --> 00:49:41,269
Oh, your plucky warrior hangs
in tranquil solitude.

876
00:49:41,373 --> 00:49:42,477
What?

877
00:49:42,581 --> 00:49:44,721
No, you're good.
You're good.

878
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,586
We were so brave just then.

879
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,933
Why do they go for the butt
so much?

880
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:14,095
What's that song you're singing?

881
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:17,202
<i>A song my abbi used to sing
to me when I was a kid.</i>

882
00:50:18,168 --> 00:50:20,826
- "If you suck life from the island...
- Yeah?

883
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,726
...the island
will suck of you."

884
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:27,764
Your grandma sang you songs about
getting sucked off by an island?

885
00:50:27,868 --> 00:50:30,215
It doesn't translate super well.

886
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:33,943
Is phantom leech syndrome,
like, a thing?

887
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:36,048
They don't lay eggs, do they?

888
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,374
Queen Taha?

889
00:51:39,974 --> 00:51:44,358
"King Kalaman
and his treasure laid to rest...

890
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:48,949
laid to rest
in the well of endless tears.

891
00:51:49,052 --> 00:51:50,985
Laid to rest in
the well of endless tears."

892
00:51:51,089 --> 00:51:52,953
- What does that mean?
- Loretta!

893
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,369
You gave me a heart attack.

894
00:51:56,059 --> 00:51:57,716
Where'd you go?

895
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:03,342
What is this?

896
00:52:03,446 --> 00:52:06,690
I'm not sure,
but maybe they gathered here?

897
00:52:09,245 --> 00:52:11,903
Can you imagine
being right here,

898
00:52:12,006 --> 00:52:14,664
right in this very spot
back then?

899
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:16,493
The stories that they told?

900
00:52:16,597 --> 00:52:19,358
So much history I'm sure
happened right here.

901
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:26,055
They've got us cornered.

902
00:52:26,158 --> 00:52:27,850
- Okay. We've got to go up. Come on.
- What?

903
00:52:27,953 --> 00:52:31,060
Have you seen what I'm wearing?
I'm in a glitter straitjacket.

904
00:52:31,163 --> 00:52:34,132
There's nowhere to go but up.
Come on. Let's go.

905
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:37,790
Oh! I should not be doing this.
I'm too old for this.

906
00:52:37,894 --> 00:52:38,999
No, you're not.
You're beautiful.

907
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:40,759
I didn't say I'm not beautiful.

908
00:52:40,863 --> 00:52:42,761
I said I'm too old
to be doing this.

909
00:52:42,865 --> 00:52:46,489
My skill is sitting and thinking
and eating when I can't think.

910
00:52:46,592 --> 00:52:49,009
Yeah, you definitely could be
wearing better shoes for this.

911
00:52:49,112 --> 00:52:51,011
You brought me these shoes.

912
00:52:51,114 --> 00:52:53,668
I can't go any further.
I can't go any further.

913
00:52:53,772 --> 00:52:55,498
I'm not doing so great here.

914
00:52:55,601 --> 00:52:57,017
You got it. Come on.

915
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,984
I know you think
that you're safer holding on,

916
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:00,365
but you have to keep going.

917
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,367
- I can't. I can't, I can't.
- Okay?

918
00:53:03,161 --> 00:53:04,610
- Do you smell that?
- Smell what?

919
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,474
- I smell something.
- Is it a predator? What is it?

920
00:53:06,578 --> 00:53:08,511
- A downward cascading fire?
- You got to smell deeper.

921
00:53:08,614 --> 00:53:09,788
I don't smell anything!

922
00:53:13,205 --> 00:53:16,450
Take a big, deep breath.

923
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:17,865
All right.

924
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:19,591
- Good job.
- Okay.

925
00:53:19,694 --> 00:53:23,319
- That was manipulative. Thank you.
- Yeah, it was.

926
00:53:23,422 --> 00:53:25,908
Here we go. I'm gonna help you
out a little bit, all right?

927
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:28,082
- One, two, three... Here we go!
- What are you doing?

928
00:53:28,186 --> 00:53:29,566
- Get out of there.
- Come on.

929
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,741
- No, no, don't flex.
- That's my hoo-hoo.

930
00:53:31,844 --> 00:53:34,778
Just ride the head.
Keep the hands moving and ride the head.

931
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:36,194
- Oh, God.
- You're doing great.

932
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:38,955
Sorry about the scratchy haircut.
Come on.

933
00:53:59,044 --> 00:54:01,288
<i>Dulcius ex asperis.</i>

934
00:54:01,874 --> 00:54:03,255
What was that?

935
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:04,877
Oh, nothing.

936
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:07,225
It was just something
that John and I would say

937
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:10,469
after we finished
something big, like a...

938
00:54:10,573 --> 00:54:12,540
like an archaeological dig
or a manuscript.

939
00:54:12,644 --> 00:54:15,958
It's Latin. It means
"sweeter after difficulty."

940
00:54:17,097 --> 00:54:18,477
What's...

941
00:54:18,581 --> 00:54:20,514
What's Latin
for "Loretta's a badass"?

942
00:54:20,617 --> 00:54:25,105
I am a badass.
I climbed a mountain.

943
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:28,177
Oh, my God. I wish Beth
could've seen us do this.

944
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,111
- Oh, God. Beth.
- Don't worry about Beth.

945
00:54:31,214 --> 00:54:34,700
She's probably got the whole
navy after us right now.

946
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:37,876
<i>I get that you think you have
to go to the island authorities yourself,</i>

947
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,397
<i>but don't worry, I'm keeping
Loretta's socials super active.</i>

948

950
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,267
And you're traveling alone?

951
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,201
Yes, I'm traveling alone.
Mm-hmm. I'm single.

952
00:54:52,787 --> 00:54:53,996
Then this might work.

953
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:55,928
- Okay! Talk to me.
- You'll hit New York.

954
00:54:56,032 --> 00:54:59,553
From there, you'll fly to Guinea,
where you can pick up a puddle jumper.

955
00:54:59,656 --> 00:55:00,726
A what?

956
00:55:01,658 --> 00:55:03,143
<i>- Small plane.
- Yeah, no leg room.</i>

957

That's fine. I'll take it.

958

<i>- Or you could just come home.
- Thank you.</i>

959
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,915
We need something more flammable.
Everything is just so wet.

960
00:55:17,019 --> 00:55:18,537
What's in here?
What's in your bag?

961
00:55:18,641 --> 00:55:20,505
- Uh...
- Oh, a lot. Okay.

962
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,058
What are you doing?

963
00:55:22,162 --> 00:55:24,026
Okay. Face masks.

964
00:55:24,129 --> 00:55:25,544
Yeah, that was like
a gift-basket thing.

965
00:55:25,648 --> 00:55:27,615
You brought a scented candle
into the jungle?

966
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:28,996
My mom gave me that.

967
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,653
It was like a weird gift
for Mother's Day.

968
00:55:30,756 --> 00:55:33,035
Your mom gives you gifts
for Mother's Day?

969
00:55:34,346 --> 00:55:35,140
<i>Noir...</i>

970
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:37,211
Eucalyptus rosemary oil.
Ooh.

971
00:55:37,798 --> 00:55:39,075
Oh, that smells good.

972
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:41,353
Um... Oh, okay. All right.

973
00:55:41,457 --> 00:55:43,079
Whoo! Yes!

974
00:55:43,183 --> 00:55:45,633
Yes, I made fire!

975
00:55:45,737 --> 00:55:49,292
- That's pretty impressive. You have to...
- It is a beautiful fire.

976
00:55:49,396 --> 00:55:51,329
Who would have thought?

977
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,917
Oh, you're just, um,
taking your shirt off?

978
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:57,059
That looks really uncomfortable.

979
00:55:57,162 --> 00:55:59,061
Are you okay? The back?

980
00:55:59,164 --> 00:56:03,237
Yeah. That is why
I don't do water.

981
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:05,619
- Okay.
- My body becomes an eighth-grader's face.

982
00:56:05,722 --> 00:56:08,587
Do you have anything for it?
Like some ointment or something?

983
00:56:08,691 --> 00:56:10,589
Yeah, I do. Well, I did.

984
00:56:10,693 --> 00:56:12,764
It was in a little,
tiny little bottle.

985
00:56:12,867 --> 00:56:14,835
It was this. I'm sorry.

986
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:16,975
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

987
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:18,425
It's okay.

988
00:56:18,528 --> 00:56:20,841
- Hold on. Yes. Come here. Come here.
- What?

989
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:23,361
- Come here. Sit down.
- Let me see.

990
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:24,948
- Just sit down.
- Right here?

991
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:26,260
Yeah.

992
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:29,091
Okay.

993
00:56:29,194 --> 00:56:31,058
Oh, no, you don't have to touch it.
It's okay. It's fine.

994
00:56:31,162 --> 00:56:33,164
I touched
your engorged sacks, so...

995
00:56:35,373 --> 00:56:37,099
- The leeches.
- Oh, okay.

996
00:56:37,202 --> 00:56:39,998
Okay, this might be
a little bit cold.

997
00:56:41,172 --> 00:56:42,897
- Sorry.
- Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

998
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:44,278
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

999
00:56:44,382 --> 00:56:46,349
Maybe this is how
Dash should die.

1000
00:56:46,453 --> 00:56:49,490
Horrible eczema outbreak.
That's so sexy.

1001
00:56:49,594 --> 00:56:51,113
I could make it work.

1002
00:56:51,561 --> 00:56:52,597
Yeah?

1003
00:56:53,253 --> 00:56:54,702
All right, then.

1004
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,705
How would you write this?

1005
00:56:57,809 --> 00:56:59,293
Okay.

1006
00:57:01,192 --> 00:57:04,505
"Warmed
by the fragrant fire..."

1007
00:57:04,609 --> 00:57:07,059
Mm-hmm.

1008
00:57:07,163 --> 00:57:09,061
- Starting strong.
- Mm-hmm.

1009
00:57:09,165 --> 00:57:12,272
"Lovemore's hands

1010

with every scarlet rim."

1015
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,567
And that didn't, uh...

1016
00:57:32,395 --> 00:57:33,914
didn't turn her off?

1017
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,226
No.

1018
00:57:36,054 --> 00:57:37,883
"Because with every
cardinal ridge,

00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:43,510
that only their bodies spoke."

1021
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,582
And what were
their bodies saying?

1022
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,102
"Take me...

1023
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,623
take me,

00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,901
take me."

1025
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,317
How's that?

1026
00:57:58,145 --> 00:57:59,422
It was good.

1027
00:57:59,526 --> 00:58:01,252
- Your back. I mean, how is your back?
- Good.

1028
00:58:01,355 --> 00:58:02,770
- Okay. You sure?
- Yeah.

1029
00:58:02,874 --> 00:58:07,430
- I also meant my back. Right there, yeah.
- Okay.

1030
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,715
Supplies.

1031
00:58:18,855 --> 00:58:23,135
Okay, I'm chilly. I think I'm gonna
probably turn in in a little bit.

1032
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:24,447
- Okay.
- You good?

1033
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:27,209
Yeah, I'm fire... fine.
I'm fine.

1034
00:58:27,312 --> 00:58:30,246
I'm not "fire."
I'm fine by the fire.

1035
00:58:30,936 --> 00:58:32,662
Okay. All right.

1036
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:43,880
Uh, it's up to you,
but if you're cold,

1037
00:58:43,984 --> 00:58:48,195
maybe we could probably both fit in
here, if you wanted to.

1038
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:50,577
Both of us?

1039
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,718
- Only if you want to. I mean, it's just...
- Yeah, no, that sounds...

1040
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,306
Uh...

1041
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:56,790
Okay. How do you...

1042
00:58:56,893 --> 00:58:58,861
You can go first,
then I'll figure it out.

1043
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:02,105
No, no, you go. It's definitely a
"ladies first" type of situation.

1044
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:04,867
- Keep hands out of the bag at all times.
- That's what I was gonna do.

1045
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:06,627
- Butt to butt.
- Hands out and butt to butt.

1046
00:59:06,731 --> 00:59:10,044
- Yeah. What do I do?
- Just get in. Go ahead and sit.

1047
00:59:10,148 --> 00:59:12,840
I sit first?
Okay. I'm in.

1048
00:59:14,394 --> 00:59:16,982
You're too heavy. You're gonna
flip this thing like a cruise ship.

1049
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,744
You watch yourself.
Hold on. I'm not in.

1050
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:23,023
Why is this engaging
my core so much?

1051
00:59:23,817 --> 00:59:25,715
How 'bout you shimmy?

1052
00:59:25,819 --> 00:59:27,924
- I can't breathe. I'm not breathing.
- Are you good?

1053
00:59:28,028 --> 00:59:29,340
My face.

1054
00:59:29,926 --> 00:59:31,169
Yeah. Okay.

1055
00:59:34,276 --> 00:59:35,760
Hands are out. Butt to butt.

1056
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:36,899
Okay.

1057
01:00:08,102 --> 01:00:09,690
Well!

1058
01:00:09,794 --> 01:00:10,933
Come on.

1059
01:00:11,036 --> 01:00:12,693
Come on! Let's hear it!

1060
01:00:12,797 --> 01:00:16,283
Let's give a nice round
of applause to Loretta!

1061
01:00:16,387 --> 01:00:18,009
She earned it.

1062
01:00:18,112 --> 01:00:21,978
A geriatric shut-in left you
holding your dicks in the jungle.

1063
01:00:22,082 --> 01:00:23,463
Good job, Loretta.

1064
01:00:23,566 --> 01:00:26,086
Boss, come on.
People are dying now.

1065
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:29,848
Don't you think that maybe
this has all gone too far?

1066
01:00:31,091 --> 01:00:32,817
Is it really worth it?

1067
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,303
I am on the cusp
of attaining the unattainable.

1068
01:00:36,407 --> 01:00:39,410
Something singular,
something no nation,

1069
01:00:39,513 --> 01:00:43,103
no emperor,
no brownnosing brothers ever have.

1070
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:46,313
The legendary Crown of Fire.

1071
01:00:46,762 --> 01:00:47,901
So, yes.

1072
01:00:48,004 --> 01:00:50,317
Yes, I would definitely say
it's worth it.

1073
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:01,570
Excuse me!

1074
01:01:01,673 --> 01:01:04,573
Excuse me, sir. I need to get
to my next connecting flight.

1075
01:01:04,676 --> 01:01:06,022
No flight.

1076
01:01:06,126 --> 01:01:08,715
The pilot is sick.
Come tomorrow.

1077
01:01:08,818 --> 01:01:10,958
No, no, sir. I cannot come tomorrow.
I need to do this today.

1078
01:01:11,062 --> 01:01:15,791
I need to get to the island Isla
Hundida tonight. Lives are at stake.

1079
01:01:15,894 --> 01:01:17,379
Come tomorrow.

1080
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,901
- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes?

1081
01:01:23,005 --> 01:01:27,078
I couldn't help but overhear
you say that you like steak.

1082
01:01:27,181 --> 01:01:30,461
Okay, this is
a little bit crazy,

1083
01:01:30,564 --> 01:01:32,359
but I also like steak.

1084
01:01:32,463 --> 01:01:34,810
- What?
- I also like steak.

1085
01:01:34,913 --> 01:01:38,365
Would you like to, maybe,
I don't know...

1086
01:01:38,469 --> 01:01:41,299
- Maybe there's a...
- No. "Lives are at stake."

1087
01:01:41,403 --> 01:01:43,163
I need to go
to the island tonight.

1088
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,682
- Ah.
- Yes.

1089
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:46,373
- Even more serious.
- Extremely.

1090
01:01:46,477 --> 01:01:49,480
Well, I believe that I
may be able to assist you.

1091
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:51,516
I have a cargo plane.

1092
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:56,383
Maybe after I make my delivery,
we could swing by your island.

1093
01:01:56,487 --> 01:01:59,282
I'm about to ask you something,
and you better tell me the truth.

1094
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:01,250
Have you ever
murdered anyone before?

1095
01:02:01,353 --> 01:02:04,598
No!

1096
01:02:08,188 --> 01:02:10,915
I don't know if I really buy it,
but let me tell you something.

1097
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:15,264
If you ever think about murdering me,
I promise, I will murder you first.

1098
01:02:15,367 --> 01:02:16,714
My pleasure.

1099
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,957
You are weird. Let's go.

1100
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:17,775
"King Kalaman and his treasure
laid to rest in the well

1101
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,846
of endless tears."

1102
01:03:21,537 --> 01:03:22,711
What is that?

1103
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:27,336
Oh, it's a... it's a thing.
I mean, it's not, uh...

1104
01:03:27,439 --> 01:03:29,683
You know, it's not
what you think it is.

1105
01:03:29,787 --> 01:03:33,584
So it's not Fairfax's fragment
of an ancient parchment?

1106
01:03:33,687 --> 01:03:37,484
Okay.
It's what you think it is.

1107
01:03:37,588 --> 01:03:39,037
Loretta, I thought
you were smarter than that.

1108
01:03:39,141 --> 01:03:41,937
Fairfax is never
gonna stop hunting us now.

1109
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,041
What were you thinking?

1110
01:03:43,145 --> 01:03:45,112
We have a volcano
that could bury the tomb

1111
01:03:45,216 --> 01:03:48,771
before we get to it, before we see
it, before we preserve its memory.

1112
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:50,808
- This is...
- I'm sorry. Is that what we're doing?

1113
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:53,431
'Cause no one told me.
When were you gonna tell me?

1114
01:03:53,535 --> 01:03:54,950
Why would I tell you?

1115
01:03:55,053 --> 01:03:56,883
We're in this together.
I came here to rescue you.

1116
01:03:56,986 --> 01:03:58,678
You know you're not Dash, right?

1117
01:03:58,781 --> 01:04:01,025
You don't ride in on a white
horse to rescue people.

1118
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:05,408
You... spray yourself with bronzer and
you stand in front of wind machines,

1119
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:07,031
which is great for you.

1120
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,792
How would you have any idea
what I'm actually like?

1121
01:04:09,896 --> 01:04:12,830
I know you. You're
a pretty open book, Alan.

1122
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:14,728
- Okay, then who am I?
- Really?

1123
01:04:14,832 --> 01:04:15,867
Yeah.

1124
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:20,147
O... Okay, uh...

1125
01:04:20,251 --> 01:04:23,357
You were a homecoming king and you
coasted on your good looks to LA,

1126
01:04:23,461 --> 01:04:25,981
but then realized that being the most
handsome kid in the middle of nowhere

1127
01:04:26,084 --> 01:04:27,810
doesn't mean
you're going to be a star.

1128
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:29,743
Until one day, when a woman
who couldn't publish her book

1129
01:04:29,847 --> 01:04:33,436
on Spanish colonization in the Atlantic
decided to write a romance novel,

1130
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,473
uh, chose you at random
to be on the cover.

1131
01:04:35,577 --> 01:04:38,994
Lucky for you and her,
the novels were a smashing success.

1132
01:04:39,097 --> 01:04:42,100
She kept writing her schlock,
you kept posing,

1133
01:04:42,204 --> 01:04:47,658
um, you know, neither one of us
becoming who we'd hoped we would be.

1134
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:51,869
Uh, and then one day,
we both die in the jungle

1135
01:04:51,972 --> 01:04:55,873
on one of those Atlantic islands
I wrote about all those years ago.

1136
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,012
Right?

1137
01:04:58,358 --> 01:04:59,670
Mm-hmm.

1138
01:05:10,957 --> 01:05:12,683
It was Sarasota, by the way.

1139
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,788
It's not nowhere.

1140
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:17,135
I grew up there with
my mom and two sisters.

1141
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:18,274
And yeah...

1142
01:05:19,275 --> 01:05:21,968
I started modeling
'cause I wanted to get away.

1143
01:05:22,071 --> 01:05:24,004
It was the only job
that I could think of

1144
01:05:24,108 --> 01:05:27,352
that could take me to all of the
places that I always dreamed of going.

1145
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:28,768
Then finally to Los Angeles,

1146
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:31,633
where I posed on the cover
of your romance novel.

1147
01:05:31,736 --> 01:05:34,636
And I was so embarrassed that one
of my friends might've seen me

1148
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:36,879
in that wig
on the cover of your book

1149
01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:39,641
that I avoided talking to them
for months.

1150
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,091
And then one day,

1151
01:05:42,816 --> 01:05:44,680
I'm walking home,

1152
01:05:44,784 --> 01:05:47,579
and I hear this lady yell,
"Dash!"

1153
01:05:47,683 --> 01:05:50,203
She runs up,
and she is so happy.

1154
01:05:50,306 --> 01:05:54,069
Then I thought,
"How could I be this embarrassed

1155
01:05:54,172 --> 01:05:56,865
about something
that makes people this happy?"

1156
01:06:00,213 --> 01:06:01,904
Loretta, you can do
whatever you want.

1157
01:06:02,008 --> 01:06:04,113
If you don't want to write
anymore, don't write.

1158
01:06:04,217 --> 01:06:08,704
But don't minimize the people that
love your work by calling it schlock.

1159
01:06:08,808 --> 01:06:11,362
That's not fair to them.

1160
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:15,469
You know what's ironic?
I thought you of all people would know

1161
01:06:15,573 --> 01:06:18,024
not to judge a book
by its cover.

1162
01:06:22,097 --> 01:06:24,686
Judge a book by its cover model.

1163
01:06:56,165 --> 01:06:57,339
Alan?

1164
01:06:57,442 --> 01:06:58,720
Alan.

1165
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:12,043
There's two of them.

1166
01:07:18,153 --> 01:07:20,845
- Loretta! I'm over here!
- Alan!

1167
01:07:21,915 --> 01:07:24,987
Alan! Motorcycles and guns,
motorcycles and guns!

1168
01:07:25,091 --> 01:07:27,231
Come on, this way!

1169
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:28,957
Stop shooting!

1170
01:07:34,203 --> 01:07:36,171
- Just give 'em the parchment!
- I can't.

1171
01:07:36,274 --> 01:07:38,932
Yes, you can, actually.
You just say, "Here," and throw it at 'em.

1172
01:07:39,036 --> 01:07:41,348
Right. And then I'm sure
they'll happily let us go.

1173
01:07:41,452 --> 01:07:43,454
- Okay, keep down.
- How do they keep finding us?

1174
01:07:43,557 --> 01:07:46,043
- You're basically a walking disco ball.
- We need to come up with a plan.

1175
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:47,216
I have an idea.

1176
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,770
We're gonna dig a hole,
throw our voices.

1177
01:07:48,873 --> 01:07:50,806
"We're over here."
Can you sound like a bird?

1178
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:53,222
- No, I have a plan.
- Alan, please, I'm thinking.

1179
01:07:53,326 --> 01:07:57,019
- I know, but I have a plan.
- Please, just let me think about...

1180
01:07:57,123 --> 01:08:00,747
- Wait a minute. They're shooting at you.
- Yeah, that's why we're hiding.

1181
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:03,163
No. No, no, no.
They're shooting only at you.

1182
01:08:03,267 --> 01:08:05,787
They won't shoot me.
It's my brain that's valuable.

1183
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:09,756
What? I don't think you actually
hear the things you say sometimes.

1184
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:12,552
- Maybe I can shield you.
- You are not shielding me.

1185
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:14,899
- I should be shielding you.
- Why? Because I'm a woman?

1186
01:08:15,003 --> 01:08:18,075
- That's supremely sexist.
- Well, look, I don't think using women as human shields

1187
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:20,905
is exactly the change that Gloria
Seinfeld had in mind, do you?

1188
01:08:21,009 --> 01:08:23,839
- Gloria Steinem?
- Whatever. Her too. You know what? Fine.

1189
01:08:23,943 --> 01:08:27,015
- Please mansplain sexism to me right now.
- Oh, my God. I am a woman.

1190
01:08:27,118 --> 01:08:29,224
I can't mansplain anything.

1191
01:08:29,327 --> 01:08:34,056
Uh, I'm a feminist, and I think a
woman can do anything a man can do.

1192
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,610
- We just need to stay here until they get tired.
- I have an idea.

1193
01:08:36,714 --> 01:08:38,405
- Please can I tell you my plan?
- Alan!

1194
01:08:38,509 --> 01:08:41,823
This is not a situation you can get
out of by ripping your shirt off.

1195
01:08:41,926 --> 01:08:43,859
Not my shirt.

1196
01:09:15,304 --> 01:09:16,616
Three!

1197
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,307
- Yes!
- Oh!

1198
01:09:22,415 --> 01:09:24,279
Oh.

1199
01:09:24,382 --> 01:09:27,627
That was different
than I had in my head.

1200
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:31,803
- I just wanted us to stop them.
- Could it have been the wind that made it do that?

1201
01:09:31,907 --> 01:09:34,013
No, I think it was us.
I think... we did it.

1202
01:09:34,116 --> 01:09:36,532
We did the one guy, right?
But that was, like...

1203
01:09:36,636 --> 01:09:39,984
We just wanted him to stop. But I think
the other guy could've moved, really.

1204
01:09:40,088 --> 01:09:42,228
So, that was...
that one was on him.

1205
01:09:42,331 --> 01:09:45,196
Even if we weren't here,
that could've happened.

1206
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,026
Why are you gonna stop
next to a cliff?

1207
01:09:47,129 --> 01:09:49,580
They were wearing helmets,
so maybe they're...

1208
01:09:49,683 --> 01:09:51,858
But the rest of their body
didn't have a helmet.

1209
01:09:51,962 --> 01:09:53,170
So there'd just be a head.

1210
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:55,551
They were driving
recklessly, right?

1211
01:09:55,655 --> 01:09:57,381
Don't be mean on a bike.

1212
01:09:58,071 --> 01:09:59,831
Don't do mean stuff on a bike.

1213
01:10:03,628 --> 01:10:05,872
I mean, perhaps they're fine.

1214
01:10:05,976 --> 01:10:08,392
Yeah, probably not.
But that's okay.

1215
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:12,775
That's all right.
You know, things happen. Let's go.

1216
01:10:14,985 --> 01:10:18,160
- You gonna put it back together?
- It's on loan.

1217
01:10:30,966 --> 01:10:33,279
- Look at me.
- Okay.

1218
01:10:34,176 --> 01:10:36,213
What more can I do, you know?

1219
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,249
You've done so much already,
Beth.

1220
01:10:38,353 --> 01:10:41,390
My poor, sweet, little Nana
has lost her sight.

1221
01:10:41,494 --> 01:10:44,221
The book release
is a complete disaster,

1222
01:10:44,324 --> 01:10:45,981
which I've leveraged
everything on,

1223
01:10:46,085 --> 01:10:48,432
so I'm probably,
most definitely broke right now.

1224
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:51,780
And most importantly,
I've lost a writer.

1225
01:10:51,883 --> 01:10:53,437
Who does that?
Who loses a writer?

1226
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:58,062
Okay, Beth, you remind me
of my best friend, Randy.

1227
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:00,651
Always looking out
for other people,

1228
01:11:00,754 --> 01:11:03,102
never taking care of herself.

1229
01:11:04,103 --> 01:11:05,518
Isn't that right, Randy?

1230
01:11:08,038 --> 01:11:09,901
She's like my therapist,
this one over here.

1231
01:11:10,005 --> 01:11:12,111
LOL. "Laughing Out Loud."

1232
01:11:12,214 --> 01:11:14,182
After you take care
of your friend,

1233
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:16,425
how about we go to a beach?

1234
01:11:16,529 --> 01:11:19,014
- What?
- Look, I have a pickup in Hawaii.

1235
01:11:19,118 --> 01:11:21,085
She doesn't have to come.

1236
01:11:21,189 --> 01:11:23,985
Okay! Okay, you can come!

1237
01:11:24,088 --> 01:11:26,090
She's hilarious.

1238
01:11:26,884 --> 01:11:28,713
Let me ask you something.

1239
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:30,922
We're all sitting here chitchatting,
but who's flying the plane?

1240
01:11:31,026 --> 01:11:32,959
- Autopilot.
- What?

1241
01:11:33,063 --> 01:11:35,789
Sir, go to the cockpit,
fly the plane.

1242
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:37,239
Okay.

1243
01:11:37,999 --> 01:11:39,759
I'm going to go land the plane.

1244
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:41,312
Okay.

1245
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:43,314
No, no, no. Take the goat.
Please, take the goat.

1246
01:11:43,418 --> 01:11:46,076
She's on break.
Enjoy the flight!

1247
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:22,836
- Hi.
- Hola.

1248
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:29,981
This English dude came in
and basically kidnapped her.

1249
01:12:32,122 --> 01:12:35,435
<i>Hey, it's Beth. Please leave a message,
and I'll get right back to you.</i>

1250
01:12:35,539 --> 01:12:38,404
Uh, hi, Beth.

1251
01:12:38,507 --> 01:12:39,508
It's me.

1252
01:12:39,612 --> 01:12:41,441
Uh, I'm alive!

1253
01:12:42,166 --> 01:12:44,203
Uh, listen, um...

1254
01:12:45,514 --> 01:12:46,550
Uh...

1255
01:12:47,999 --> 01:12:52,107
I'm sorry that I
blew up the book tour.

1256
01:12:52,211 --> 01:12:53,936
Um...

1257
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,422
I was just afraid

1258
01:12:57,561 --> 01:12:59,218
and selfish. Uh...

1259
01:12:59,321 --> 01:13:02,048
Oh, here comes Alan.
I'll call you back.

1260
01:13:05,224 --> 01:13:08,227
So, uh, police
are searching for Fairfax,

1261
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:10,781
and they're gonna provide us
protection while we're here.

1262
01:13:10,884 --> 01:13:12,714
Did they say
how long we'd be here?

1263
01:13:12,817 --> 01:13:15,475
They're gonna try to get us on a
puddle jumper later this evening.

1264
01:13:15,579 --> 01:13:17,788
But, uh, they said in the
meantime, the inn is really nice,

1265
01:13:17,891 --> 01:13:20,480
and we can get cleaned up
and maybe a change of clothes.

1266
01:13:20,584 --> 01:13:21,999
Okay.

1267
01:13:25,451 --> 01:13:27,004
Okay. Yeah.

1268
01:14:19,781 --> 01:14:21,231
Thank you.

1269
01:14:21,817 --> 01:14:25,062
Come on.

1270
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:26,408
Dance with your husband.

1271
01:14:26,512 --> 01:14:28,307
- No, no, no.
- He's not my husband.

1272
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:30,136
- It's okay.
- Dance with him.

1273
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,725
No, no. She doesn't want to.
She doesn't have the right shoes.

1274
01:14:32,828 --> 01:14:35,348
Actually, it's the only thing
these shoes are right for.

1275
01:14:35,452 --> 01:14:37,695
You don't have to do this.

1276
01:14:37,799 --> 01:14:39,559
It's okay. It's okay.

1277
01:14:40,457 --> 01:14:41,423
Yeah?

1278
01:16:00,053 --> 01:16:01,745
I wonder what she's saying.

1279
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:05,611
It's folklore.

1280
01:16:07,026 --> 01:16:09,062
Love song about a woman

1281
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:12,480
whose lover died,
and she didn't want to leave his side.

1282
01:16:13,515 --> 01:16:16,346
So she laid down
and refused to get up.

1283
01:16:16,932 --> 01:16:18,693
Must be scary.

1284
01:16:18,796 --> 01:16:22,697
Having to face your future without
the person that you planned it with.

1285
01:16:35,054 --> 01:16:36,607
What was that?

1286
01:16:38,747 --> 01:16:42,406
Excuse me. Excuse me. The, um...
the last line that you sang.

1287
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,857
<i>¿Quién llorará junto a mí?</i>

1288
01:16:47,791 --> 01:16:50,621
"The island will weep for
me in the well of endless tears."

1289
01:16:50,725 --> 01:16:54,107
What is that, the well of endless tears?
Is that a real place, or...

1290
01:16:54,211 --> 01:16:55,833
Sinkhole place.

1291
01:16:57,628 --> 01:16:59,354
<i>Thank you. Gracias, gracias.</i>

1292
01:16:59,458 --> 01:17:01,529
- Come here, come here.
- What is it?

1293
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:04,980
Hey, on the parchment, it said,

1294
01:17:05,084 --> 01:17:09,157
"King Kalaman and his treasure laid
to rest in the well of endless tears."

1295
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,366
I thought
maybe it was a metaphor.

1296
01:17:11,884 --> 01:17:13,437
It's not.

1297
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:16,406
The Well of Endless Tears
is a place.

1298
01:17:16,509 --> 01:17:18,511
It's a sinkhole.

1299
01:17:18,615 --> 01:17:20,789
There's a sinkhole on the map.

1300
01:17:22,135 --> 01:17:23,896
I think the tomb is there.

1301
01:17:23,999 --> 01:17:26,381
- This is so much better than your books.
- What?

1302
01:17:26,485 --> 01:17:27,969
There's like...
No, I don't mean any offense.

1303
01:17:28,072 --> 01:17:29,971
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
- It's, like, equal.

1304
01:17:30,074 --> 01:17:32,283
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
- Look at you. You want to go there.

1305
01:17:32,387 --> 01:17:34,251
- What? No.
- I can see. Yes, you do.

1306
01:17:34,355 --> 01:17:37,461
That would be insane. That would be insane.
I just... I just...

1307
01:17:37,565 --> 01:17:41,948
It's just that we're so close to
it, but, you know, we can't...

1308
01:17:42,052 --> 01:17:43,364
No.

1309
01:17:43,467 --> 01:17:46,159
This is your story.
How do you want to write it?

1310
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:49,266
I'd like to know
that it's there,

1311
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:51,026
that all this meant something.

1312
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:52,994
Okay. Then let's go.

1313
01:17:53,097 --> 01:17:54,961
We'll stay one more day.
As soon as the sun's up,

1314
01:17:55,065 --> 01:17:56,825
we're gonna go find
the Well of Endless Tears.

1315
01:17:56,929 --> 01:17:59,794
- But what if it's nothing?
- So what? Then we say we tried.

1316
01:17:59,897 --> 01:18:01,140
And Fairfax?

1317
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:03,660
The cops are after Fairfax.
Don't worry about him.

1318
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:05,558
This is crazy.

1319
01:18:05,662 --> 01:18:07,353
- Yeah, but look at you.
- What?

1320
01:18:07,457 --> 01:18:10,425
It's the very first time I've
ever seen you totally unafraid.

1321
01:18:11,046 --> 01:18:12,772
And alive.

1322
01:18:12,876 --> 01:18:15,396
I'm gonna go tell them our plans
have changed and find us a ride.

1323
01:18:15,499 --> 01:18:16,949
Where are you going?

1324
01:18:20,608 --> 01:18:22,679
I see you met my friend here.

1325
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:27,166
He told me you were just
about to jump on a plane,

1326
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:29,720
without so much as
saying goodbye.

1327
01:18:29,824 --> 01:18:33,241
I said, "No way.
Not my Loretta.

1328
01:18:33,344 --> 01:18:37,797
Not when she's the only one
who can lead me to the tomb."

1329
01:18:41,214 --> 01:18:43,285
Stop squeezing so hard.

1330
01:18:44,114 --> 01:18:46,910
Ow. Get your hands off of me!

1331
01:18:47,773 --> 01:18:49,637
Ow! Let go!

1332
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,328
I-I need a car.

1333
01:18:51,432 --> 01:18:53,364
A car, an auto.
Does anybody have an auto?

1334
01:19:01,856 --> 01:19:02,926
No, no. No.

1335
01:19:03,651 --> 01:19:04,962
I-I-I need an auto.

1336
01:19:05,066 --> 01:19:06,412
I'll trade you my watch.

1337
01:19:06,516 --> 01:19:07,931
It's a really expensive watch.
Do you have a car?

1338
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:09,553
It's a Bulgari.
This thing glows in the dark.

1339
01:19:09,657 --> 01:19:11,452
- It's waterproof.
- I have motorcycle.

1340
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,812
Cool, isn't it?

1341
01:19:26,915 --> 01:19:30,022
I always thought, why can't your
personal tank also have a minibar?

1342
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:31,610
Have a drink.

1343
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:33,266
Do you mind?

1344
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:34,785
Uh, yes.

1345
01:19:34,889 --> 01:19:37,029
He has a bit of a grudge
against you, I'm afraid.

1346
01:19:37,132 --> 01:19:39,928
Something about a motorbike
accident his friends had?

1347
01:19:40,032 --> 01:19:41,205
Why are you doing this?

1348
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:43,069
I want something
nobody else has.

1349
01:19:43,967 --> 01:19:45,796
When my father gifted...

1350
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:50,387
As I was saying,

1351
01:19:50,491 --> 01:19:53,424
when my father gifted his empire

1352
01:19:53,528 --> 01:19:55,979
to my baby brother...

1353
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,539
Who is that?

1354
01:20:13,272 --> 01:20:15,481
Is that a Ken doll on a moped?

1355
01:20:16,275 --> 01:20:17,794
I know him from somewhere.

1356
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:19,554
Oh, I-I-I doubt that.

1357
01:20:19,658 --> 01:20:21,867
Because what you are looking at

1358
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:24,870
is a highly trained
combat specialist,

1359
01:20:24,973 --> 01:20:28,563
forged in the furnaces
of Afghanistan, Iraq,

1360
01:20:28,667 --> 01:20:31,255
Kuwait, Sa... Sarasota...

1361
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,430
Incredible skin.
No eczema problems.

1362
01:20:33,534 --> 01:20:37,227
And he will not stop
until I am safe!

1363
01:20:37,330 --> 01:20:39,540
So you pull
this space tank over,

1364
01:20:39,643 --> 01:20:42,784
unless you would like to perish
like his friends did.

1365
01:20:42,888 --> 01:20:46,305
And he is responsible
for their perishment.

1366
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:49,101
He might not have meant to,

1367
01:20:49,204 --> 01:20:52,483
but they... perished, so...

1368
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:08,672
Okay, who-who is this?

1369
01:21:08,776 --> 01:21:10,674
I have seen him
somewhere before.

1370
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:14,402
No, no, no.

1371
01:21:14,505 --> 01:21:16,231
That's your cover model,
isn't it?

1372
01:21:16,335 --> 01:21:18,613
Yes. I knew
I knew him from somewhere.

1373
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:20,581
Get up there.

1374
01:21:20,684 --> 01:21:22,065
And kill him creatively.

1375
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:24,274
I love watching hunks fail.

1376
01:21:26,621 --> 01:21:28,865
I guess I-I will
have that drink.

1377
01:21:30,556 --> 01:21:31,833
Oh, shit.

1378
01:21:31,937 --> 01:21:34,491
Is it okay
if I just top 'er off?

1379
01:21:34,595 --> 01:21:35,768
Yeah, that's fine, but...

1380
01:21:35,872 --> 01:21:37,839
Oh, my God,
have you used a glass before?

1381
01:21:37,943 --> 01:21:39,289
Sorry.

1382
01:21:39,392 --> 01:21:40,877
What would Jack Trainer do?

1383
01:21:43,086 --> 01:21:44,156
It's hot in here.

1384
01:21:44,259 --> 01:21:47,262
Anyone else feeling
how hot it is?

1385
01:21:47,366 --> 01:21:48,436
Are you trying to be sexy?

1386
01:21:48,539 --> 01:21:50,334
This is very weird.
Please, stop.

1387
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,336
I could set your world on fire.

1388
01:22:02,933 --> 01:22:05,246
Go to sleep! Go to sleep!

1389
01:22:05,349 --> 01:22:07,075
Go to sleep! Sleep!

1390
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:11,321
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1391
01:22:11,424 --> 01:22:12,702
Time-out.

1392
01:22:12,805 --> 01:22:13,737
Time-in!

1393
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:22,401
No! Don't shoot her!
I need her!

1394
01:22:24,058 --> 01:22:25,922
Oh, Jesus!

1395
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:27,440
Ow, ow, ow.

1396
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:33,792
Move your foot! Move your foot!

1397
01:22:36,864 --> 01:22:39,073
Go to sleep, asshole.

1398
01:22:39,176 --> 01:22:40,833
Get out there! Look!

1399
01:22:45,424 --> 01:22:46,736
A bigger guy?

1400
01:22:46,839 --> 01:22:48,047
Oh, no.

1401
01:22:49,393 --> 01:22:50,636
What?

1402
01:22:53,121 --> 01:22:54,053
Move it!

1403
01:22:55,779 --> 01:22:58,092
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1404
01:22:58,989 --> 01:23:00,888
Hey! Get in.

1405
01:23:01,405 --> 01:23:02,510
Him or me?

1406
01:23:06,617 --> 01:23:11,415
This is not one of your cheap,
vapid lady-fantasy books, Loretta.

1407
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:13,486
This is real life.

1408
01:23:14,418 --> 01:23:16,282
And we will kill him.

1409
01:23:16,386 --> 01:23:18,112
Tell us where the tomb is.

1410
01:23:32,782 --> 01:23:34,093
Hi.
So, whoever's in charge,

1411
01:23:34,197 --> 01:23:36,820
I need you to send
officials to go here.

1412
01:23:36,924 --> 01:23:38,028
Here.

1413
01:23:39,167 --> 01:23:40,997
We are closed.

1414
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,446
You're closed?

1415
01:23:44,379 --> 01:23:47,486
You know I've been trying to
take a nap for a year and a half?

1416
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:49,143
A year and a half.

1417
01:23:50,075 --> 01:23:53,181
I have been burning the candle
at both ends,

1418
01:23:53,285 --> 01:23:54,631
the midnight oil,

1419
01:23:54,735 --> 01:23:57,703
since way before
my friend got kidnapped.

1420
01:23:57,807 --> 01:23:59,670
And all I want to do

1421
01:24:00,223 --> 01:24:02,363
is kick my feet back

1422
01:24:02,466 --> 01:24:03,709
and drink some wine

1423
01:24:03,813 --> 01:24:06,194
that I'm probably
too tired to drink.

1424
01:24:06,298 --> 01:24:08,231
And I want a massage.

1425
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:12,994
I want someone to massage
my shoulders and my feet,

1426
01:24:13,098 --> 01:24:15,134
and I want it at the same time.

1427
01:24:15,238 --> 01:24:18,931
And I don't care if logistically
that doesn't make sense.

1428
01:24:19,035 --> 01:24:21,692
Because I have worked hard.

1429
01:24:22,555 --> 01:24:25,006
The same way that
I know that you have.

1430
01:24:25,904 --> 01:24:28,113
So I hate to ask you

1431
01:24:28,216 --> 01:24:30,598
to leave this place open
a few more minutes,

1432
01:24:30,701 --> 01:24:32,634
because if we don't,

1433
01:24:32,738 --> 01:24:36,293
a very close friend of mine
and her cover model

1434
01:24:36,397 --> 01:24:38,157
are going to die.

1435
01:25:01,008 --> 01:25:02,561
No good way in, boss!

1436
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:04,805
What about the caves?

1437
01:25:05,564 --> 01:25:06,910
That's too dangerous!

1438
01:25:07,014 --> 01:25:10,017
Well,
we'll be very careful then.

1439
01:25:23,582 --> 01:25:24,894
Well, come on!

1440
01:25:29,588 --> 01:25:31,417
- This way.
- I have a rule about

1441
01:25:31,521 --> 01:25:33,040
not going into
super creepy caves.

1442
01:25:44,396 --> 01:25:47,330
- Julian?
- His name is Julian?

1443
01:25:47,433 --> 01:25:50,298
He seems more like
a Buck or a Bruce.

1444
01:25:50,402 --> 01:25:51,886
Lead the way.

1445
01:25:55,579 --> 01:25:57,961
Go on. Don't be scared.

1446
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:29,510
Watch your step there.

1447
01:26:29,613 --> 01:26:30,787
Bruce!

1448
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:31,892
- Julian. Oh, no!
- Julian!

1449
01:26:31,995 --> 01:26:33,617
Whoa.

1450
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:35,240
Whoa.

1451
01:26:35,896 --> 01:26:37,380
Well...

1452
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:39,934
Let's not have
his death be in vain.

1453
01:26:40,038 --> 01:26:42,799
- Onward and upward.
- What do you mean onward?

1454
01:26:42,903 --> 01:26:45,353
We're not gonna go
and get him now, are we?

1455
01:26:45,457 --> 01:26:46,872
Oh, man.

1456
01:26:59,264 --> 01:27:00,921
- It's nothing.
- Okay.

1457
01:27:01,024 --> 01:27:03,716
Yeah. Look, let's just
go back to the boat.

1458
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:05,684
This is over.
Nobody else has to die.

1459
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:07,962
No, no, no. Ha-ha!
It's a breeze.

1460
01:27:08,066 --> 01:27:10,516
There's a tunnel.
This could lead to the tomb.

1461
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:12,484
- That's not person-sized.
- Ah, speak for yourself.

1462
01:27:12,587 --> 01:27:14,865
Come on.
It's practically a kiddie slide.

1463
01:27:14,969 --> 01:27:17,282
- More like a rock sphincter.
- Or a troll anus.

1464
01:27:17,385 --> 01:27:19,767
All right, well, you are
going through the anus...

1465
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:21,182
the hole... the tunnel!

1466
01:27:21,286 --> 01:27:23,288
- Why her?
- You are our canary in the coal mine.

1467
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:24,806
No, that's impossible.
I can't.

1468
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:26,360
Please let us know
if you get through.

1469
01:27:26,463 --> 01:27:28,776
If we don't hear from you,
Fabio's got to die.

1470
01:27:28,879 --> 01:27:31,054
Wait,
I'm the damsel in distress?

1471
01:27:31,744 --> 01:27:32,987
It's okay. I'm fine.

1472
01:28:09,023 --> 01:28:11,474
I can't.
I'm so sorry. I can't.

1473
01:28:11,577 --> 01:28:13,303
- Hey.
- What?

1474
01:28:14,028 --> 01:28:15,996
Hey, you smell that?

1475
01:28:16,099 --> 01:28:19,033
You mean centuries worth of bat feces?
Yes, I definitely smell that.

1476
01:28:19,137 --> 01:28:21,346
You gotta take
a big breath for me.

1477
01:28:26,454 --> 01:28:27,835
There you go.

1478
01:28:27,938 --> 01:28:29,802
You can do it, Loretta.

1479
01:28:42,746 --> 01:28:45,508
I think I see a way out.

1480
01:28:49,063 --> 01:28:51,272
Oh, cheese and rice!

1481
01:28:55,966 --> 01:28:57,313
I made it!

1482
01:28:57,416 --> 01:28:58,900
I made it!

1483
01:28:59,004 --> 01:29:01,489
See? Totally safe.

1484
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:03,560
Go on. Your turn.

1485
01:29:05,252 --> 01:29:08,151
I'm coming through!
Be right there, okay?

1486
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:14,459
Why would they build this here?

1487
01:30:15,563 --> 01:30:17,289
But how is anyone
supposed to worship

1488
01:30:17,393 --> 01:30:19,084
or remember you
if they can't even see it?

1489
01:30:19,188 --> 01:30:21,051
They aren't.

1490
01:30:21,155 --> 01:30:24,124
This isn't a monument
to Kalaman's power.

1491
01:30:25,228 --> 01:30:27,817
It's a hiding place
for a grieving woman.

1492
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,372
Taha came here
to be with her fallen lover.

1493
01:30:33,029 --> 01:30:34,479
She just wanted to be alone.

1494
01:30:36,136 --> 01:30:37,654
Taha doesn't want us here.

1495
01:30:37,758 --> 01:30:39,104
God, shut up, Rafi.

1496
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:41,071
It's just the volcano.

1497
01:30:42,728 --> 01:30:44,040
Come on.

1498
01:30:49,183 --> 01:30:50,840
We have to keep going.

1499
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,677
All right.
Let's go, Muscles.

1500
01:31:01,471 --> 01:31:03,301
Open it up.

1501
01:31:03,404 --> 01:31:05,855
- Don't disturb them.
- She will be wearing the headdress.

1502
01:31:05,958 --> 01:31:08,547
Come on. We didn't come all this
way just to pay our respects.

1503
01:31:08,651 --> 01:31:10,308
I can't, um...

1504
01:31:13,069 --> 01:31:15,278
<i>- Uh...
- I'm sorry, abuela.</i>

1505
01:31:36,506 --> 01:31:37,818
What is that?

1506
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:42,374
Are those... seashells?

1507
01:31:43,133 --> 01:31:45,998
The crown is made of seashells?

1508
01:31:46,102 --> 01:31:47,655
Where's the treasure?

1509
01:31:48,656 --> 01:31:50,106
She's holding him.

1510
01:31:52,902 --> 01:31:54,662
You mean the dead guy?

1511
01:32:01,186 --> 01:32:02,394
Look.

1512
01:32:04,396 --> 01:32:06,122
It's their courtship.

1513
01:32:06,226 --> 01:32:10,126
Kalaman is searching the island
for something.

1514
01:32:12,956 --> 01:32:14,544
Rare red seashells.

1515
01:32:14,648 --> 01:32:19,653
To prove his love,
he gave her one shell every day for a year

1516
01:32:19,756 --> 01:32:21,310
and made them into a crown,

1517
01:32:21,413 --> 01:32:24,209
bright red like
the flame of their love,

1518
01:32:24,313 --> 01:32:27,695
until the day came
where she accepted his proposal.

1519
01:32:27,799 --> 01:32:29,559
It was never about jewels.

1520
01:32:29,663 --> 01:32:33,391
Kalaman and Taha's riches
weren't material.

1521
01:32:35,324 --> 01:32:37,257
It was their love.

1522
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,707
That's what it meant.
That was enough.

1523
01:32:39,811 --> 01:32:41,019
So that's it?

1524
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:44,816
All of that time and money

1525
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:49,234
spent on, what,
just a cheap metaphor?

1526
01:32:49,338 --> 01:32:52,133
- It's a pretty rich metaphor.
- Oh, shut up!

1527
01:32:52,237 --> 01:32:54,274
We got to go. We got to go now.

1528
01:32:54,377 --> 01:32:57,553
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, no, no. You are staying here.

1529
01:32:57,656 --> 01:32:59,727
You think it's all
so sweet and poetic.

1530
01:32:59,831 --> 01:33:02,316
Well, then you can stay here
and spend your last moments

1531
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:05,354
pondering the richness
of that metaphor.

1532
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:08,322
- Get in.
- What? Come on, man.

1533
01:33:08,426 --> 01:33:10,876
- Oh, God. Just get in. Get in the tomb.
- Okay, okay.

1534
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,603
It's better to be buried
alive than buried dead, I guess.

1535
01:33:13,707 --> 01:33:16,986
- It's really not.
- You know, it is a shame, really.

1536
01:33:17,089 --> 01:33:18,608
This is a hell of a story.

1537
01:33:18,712 --> 01:33:21,404
Pity you won't be around
to tell it. Come on.

1538
01:33:21,508 --> 01:33:23,095
- But they'll die.
- So will you

1539
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:25,788
if you don't stop being such a snowflake!
Get over here!

1540
01:33:35,384 --> 01:33:37,386
This is fine.
This is not an active nightmare

1541
01:33:37,489 --> 01:33:39,146
I've had since
I was 14 years old.

1542
01:33:40,906 --> 01:33:42,391
Ow!

1543
01:33:42,494 --> 01:33:46,222
Why are you going so fast?
It's not a race.

1544
01:33:51,227 --> 01:33:53,540
Wait, no! What are you doing?
Come back here!

1545
01:33:53,643 --> 01:33:58,338
You may have bought the island,
but now the island owns you!

1546
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,685
You can't just leave me here!

1547
01:34:02,721 --> 01:34:05,103
Rafi! Come back!

1548
01:34:07,277 --> 01:34:08,693
I need a boat!

1549
01:34:18,116 --> 01:34:20,221
Hey, hey, stop! Stop!

1550
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:24,087
Help! Help!

1551
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:26,296
One of the locals
just stole my boat!

1552
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,160
Have you seen a woman?

1553
01:34:28,264 --> 01:34:31,371
She's a brunette
in a sequined jumpsuit.

1554
01:34:31,474 --> 01:34:35,478
No. Is she in some sort
of trouble?

1555
01:34:47,145 --> 01:34:48,871
It's kind of funny.

1556
01:34:50,286 --> 01:34:52,081
I used to think this...

1557
01:34:52,184 --> 01:34:54,083
this sort of thing
was so romantic.

1558
01:34:54,186 --> 01:34:55,567
Yeah?

1559
01:34:55,671 --> 01:34:59,019
Being locked in a coffin
about to be buried by lava,

1560
01:34:59,122 --> 01:35:01,711
or... cuddling dead people?

1561
01:35:02,505 --> 01:35:05,577
Just laying down
with a lost love.

1562
01:35:05,681 --> 01:35:06,889
Like Taha did.

1563
01:35:09,443 --> 01:35:10,651
- God.
- Oh...

1564
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:12,619
Oh, God.

1565
01:35:12,722 --> 01:35:14,931
I'm sorry.

1566
01:35:15,035 --> 01:35:17,486
I'm sorry that
I couldn't save you.

1567
01:35:17,589 --> 01:35:19,557
I'm sorry I couldn't be Dash.

1568
01:35:20,143 --> 01:35:21,421
You're right.

1569
01:35:22,456 --> 01:35:24,009
You're nothing like Dash.

1570
01:35:24,113 --> 01:35:27,150
You didn't ride in on a
white horse to save me.

1571
01:35:27,254 --> 01:35:32,639
You rode in on a...
borrowed scooter with a broken muffler.

1572
01:35:34,019 --> 01:35:35,435
Yeah.

1573
01:35:35,538 --> 01:35:38,438
I never could've written
a Dash like you.

1574
01:35:40,336 --> 01:35:42,269
'Cause I never knew

1575
01:35:42,959 --> 01:35:44,754
a Dash like Alan.

1576
01:35:44,858 --> 01:35:47,308
I was so afraid
of being hurt by life again

1577
01:35:47,412 --> 01:35:48,793
that I just stopped living.

1578
01:35:48,896 --> 01:35:50,898
Couldn't see the good things
in front of me.

1579
01:35:51,002 --> 01:35:54,488
I'm just so sorry
I didn't see you sooner.

1580
01:35:55,455 --> 01:35:57,180
I have a confession too.

1581
01:35:57,284 --> 01:36:01,184
See, I was really liking where
this new story of ours was headed.

1582
01:36:01,288 --> 01:36:04,498
I just wanted to see how
it was gonna turn out, I guess.

1583
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:08,364
<i>The Adventures
of Loretta and Alan.</i>

1584
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:12,402
No, it would need
a better title than that.

1585
01:36:12,506 --> 01:36:14,474
Yeah, definitely.
Definitely.

1586
01:36:15,613 --> 01:36:19,409
Sorry. Just...
Taha's femur is poking me.

1587
01:36:23,103 --> 01:36:24,863
Rafi must have left that.

1588
01:36:24,967 --> 01:36:27,487
How do you forget your crowbar?
It's gonna help us escape.

1589
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:29,212
No, he left it on purpose.

1590
01:36:29,316 --> 01:36:31,007
Oh, cool. I always liked him.

1591
01:36:31,111 --> 01:36:32,526
- One...
- Okay.

1592
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:34,459
- ...two, three!
- Okay.

1593
01:36:34,563 --> 01:36:38,498
I would've preferred him to not leave
us here in the first place, but...

1594
01:36:39,188 --> 01:36:40,016
Okay.

1595
01:37:01,072 --> 01:37:03,281
<i>Dulcius ex asperis.</i>

1596
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:09,529
Sweeter after difficulty.

1597
01:37:16,156 --> 01:37:17,606
Go up!
Run for the trees!

1598
01:37:18,814 --> 01:37:21,713
Wait. Nope. Never mind.
Trees are on fire.

1599
01:37:22,162 --> 01:37:23,853
Okay.

1600
01:37:25,441 --> 01:37:27,305
We can go back
through the tunnel.

1601
01:37:28,271 --> 01:37:29,549
Nope. Tunnel's a no-go.

1602
01:37:34,657 --> 01:37:36,625
Um, okay.
I'm open to other ideas.

1603
01:37:36,728 --> 01:37:40,283
There's a current.
We can follow it into the ocean.

1604
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:42,009
How do we know
what's on the other side?

1605
01:37:42,527 --> 01:37:43,597
We don't.

1606
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:47,567
There's only one way
to find out.

1607
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:50,777
- Worth the rash.
- Yeah?

1608
01:38:11,763 --> 01:38:12,764
Alan?

1609
01:38:21,221 --> 01:38:22,463
Alan!

1610
01:38:59,915 --> 01:39:00,916
Alan?

1611
01:39:01,019 --> 01:39:03,712
A... Alan?

1612
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:05,921
Alan!

1613
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,926
Oh, my God! You're alive!

1614
01:39:11,029 --> 01:39:13,273
- I'm alive.
- Oh, my God. I thought I killed you.

1615
01:39:16,241 --> 01:39:17,208
Is that Beth?

1616
01:39:17,311 --> 01:39:18,554
Loretta!

1617
01:39:19,175 --> 01:39:20,349
Beth!

1618
01:39:20,452 --> 01:39:22,109
- Beth!
- Beth!

1619
01:39:22,213 --> 01:39:23,455
Beth!

1620
01:39:29,116 --> 01:39:30,497
Beth, you're here!

1621
01:39:31,153 --> 01:39:32,361
Why are you here?

1622
01:39:32,464 --> 01:39:35,260
I told you I got your back,
girl!

1623
01:39:35,847 --> 01:39:37,642
I'm so sorry!

1624
01:39:37,746 --> 01:39:39,851
I destroyed the jumpsuit!

1625
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:41,301
What?

1626
01:39:41,404 --> 01:39:43,924
Never mind! Later.

1627
01:39:44,028 --> 01:39:46,030
I found a British guy in a cave.

1628
01:39:46,133 --> 01:39:48,618
I thought he was a little boy,
but he has a full beard.

1629
01:39:48,722 --> 01:39:52,001
Beth, that's Fairfax!
He kidnapped us!

1630
01:39:52,105 --> 01:39:54,866
He's a bad guy, Beth!
He killed my trainer!

1631
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:55,971
Get him!

1632
01:39:56,488 --> 01:39:57,662
Stop him!

1633
01:40:05,497 --> 01:40:07,707
I got your back, girl.

1634
01:40:09,847 --> 01:40:11,814
Where were you running?
It's a boat.

1635
01:40:11,918 --> 01:40:13,436
This guy's hilarious.

1636
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:15,266
Got you.

1637
01:40:15,369 --> 01:40:16,646
Swim over to the rock!

1638
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:18,821
- I don't got you. No, I got you.
- I got you.

1639
01:40:18,925 --> 01:40:20,823
We're gonna get you.
It's gonna be okay.

No, you can take Randy.

Remember, you are
my platonic man friend.

Platonic?
I like the sound of that.

How did you know?

1661

Um...

- Okay. I'll write it.

Okay.

Why are you laughing at me?

01:42:59,706 --> 01:43:02,812
- Okay, no, you can't throb.
- Why not?

1693
01:43:02,916 --> 01:43:04,642
Can't come out of the
gate with a throb.

1694
01:43:04,745 --> 01:43:07,058
- You throb all the time.
- I don't come out of the gate with it.

1695
01:43:07,162 --> 01:43:09,060
- You have to earn the throb.
- Who made you the queen of throb?

1696
01:43:09,164 --> 01:43:12,857
It's usually a chapter four thing. You
want it brought up appropriately in four.

1697
01:43:12,961 --> 01:43:15,066
I think you throb in all the chapters.
"Pulsating."

1698
01:43:15,170 --> 01:43:17,103
It's a precursor to throb.

1699
01:43:17,206 --> 01:43:19,312
- "Undulating."
- You just jumped to five.

1700
01:43:19,415 --> 01:43:22,280
- How 'bout they just kiss? Why not?
- Just like a regular kiss?

1701
01:43:22,384 --> 01:43:24,248
Yeah. Like a
beginning-of-the-chapter kiss.

1702
01:43:24,351 --> 01:43:25,939
I'm good at starting...

1703
01:43:29,805 --> 01:43:31,289
How was that? Any notes?

1704
01:43:32,049 --> 01:43:35,431
Very good first chapter attempt.

1705
01:45:00,689 --> 01:45:02,173
Psst!

1706
01:45:02,829 --> 01:45:04,313
Psst.

1707
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,281
Psst.

1708
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,318
Mother...

1709
01:45:09,422 --> 01:45:11,148
You were dead.

1710
01:45:11,251 --> 01:45:14,116
Your brains came out of your face
and hit the back of my throat.

1711
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:16,774
- He was in my mouth.
- Don't say he was in your mouth.

1712
01:45:16,877 --> 01:45:18,500
- I could taste you.
- Don't ever say that.

1713
01:45:18,603 --> 01:45:23,781
We only use 10% of our brain,
so I just switched to another 10%.

1714
01:45:23,884 --> 01:45:26,715
So, you're okay?

1715
01:45:26,818 --> 01:45:28,510
One hundred percent.

1716
01:45:28,613 --> 01:45:30,098
Meaning 10%.

1717
01:45:30,201 --> 01:45:31,961
We thought you were dead.

1718
01:45:32,065 --> 01:45:34,792
Naturally, I have some anger
issues I need to let go of.

1719
01:45:34,895 --> 01:45:37,243
- Of course.
- And resentment.

1720
01:45:39,141 --> 01:45:40,487
So good to see you, man.

1721
01:45:40,591 --> 01:45:42,662
Okay,
let's keep the chatter down.

1722
01:45:42,765 --> 01:45:47,149
We're closing our eyes
and reconnecting to our breath.

1723
01:45:48,219 --> 01:45:49,324
Great.

1724
01:45:50,152 --> 01:45:51,153
Great.

1725
01:45:51,243 --> 01:45:53,243
