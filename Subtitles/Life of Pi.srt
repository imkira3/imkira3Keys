1
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,707
<i>So you were raised in a zoo?</i>

2
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,083
<i>Born and raised.</i>

3
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,712
<i>In Pondicherry, in what was
the French part of India.</i>

4
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,748
<i>My father owned the zoo...</i>

5
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,214
<i>and I was delivered on short
notice by a herpetologist...</i>

6
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,880
<i>who was there to check
on the Bengal monitor lizard.</i>

7
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,432
<i>Mother and I
were both healthy...</i>

8
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,218
<i>but the poor lizard escaped...</i>

9
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,433
<i>and was trampled
by a frightened cassowary.</i>

10
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,900
The way of karma, huh?

11
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,440
The way of God.

12
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,151
That's quite a story.

13
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,028
I had assumed your father was a

14
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,526
mathematician
because of your name.

15
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,787
Far from it, I was named
after a swimming pool.

16
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,786
There is a swimming pool named "Pi"?

17
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,202
You see,
my uncle Francis was born

18
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,455
with too much
water in his lungs.

19
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,882
They say the doctors
swung Francis around

20
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,092
by the ankles to
clear the water out...

21
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,924
and that's what gave him the
huge chest and skinny legs...

22
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,384
that made him
such a great swimmer.

23
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,016
Is Francis actually your uncle?

24
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,885
He said he was
friends with your father.

25
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,056
He's my honorary uncle,
I call him Mamaji.

26
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,975
My father's best friend,
my swimming guru.

27
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,733
<i>I trained with him three
times a week at the ashram.</i>

28
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,944
<i>His lessons would save my
life in the end.</i>

29
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:20,113
A mouthful of water will not
harm you, but panic will.

30
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,620
Remember to breathe now,
don't hold your breath.

31
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,459
Good boy.

32
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,631
I hope you don't
mind vegetarian.

33
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,134
No, no. Not at all.

34
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,260
And your name?
Huh?

35
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,423
You were going to tell me how
you got your name, I think.

36
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,594
Oh, yes. I got it from something
Mamaji once told my father.

37
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,478
You see, most travelers collect

38
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,181
postcards or teacups
on their journeys...

39
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,348
but not Mamaji.

40
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,609
Mamaji collects swimming pools.

41
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,486
He swims in every
pool he comes upon.

42
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,493
<i>One day, Mamaji
said to my father that,</i>

43
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,456
<i>of all the pools
in the world...</i>

44
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,960
<i>the most beautiful was
a public pool in Paris.</i>

45
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,712
<i>That the water
there was so clear,</i>

46
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,006
<i>you could make your
morning coffee with it.</i>

47
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,509
<i>That a single swim
there changed his life.</i>

48
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,150
<i>Before I was born, he said...</i>

49
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,903
<i>"If you want your son
to have a clean soul...</i>

50
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:39,487
<i>you must take him one day to
swim in the Piscine Molitor."</i>

51
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,495
<i>I never understood why my father
took this so much to heart.</i>

52
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:49,160
But he did, and I was named
"Piscine Molitor Patel."

53
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,371
<i>Imagine me trying
to explain that name.</i>

54
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,211
<i>I barely made it to
the age of 11 before...</i>

55
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,421
Hey, Piscine!

56
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,214
Are you pissing right now?

57
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,385
Look at him, he's pissing!

58
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,724
<i>With one word, my name went from
an elegant French swimming pool...</i>

59
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,684
<i>to a stinking Indian latrine.</i>

60
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,686
<i>I was "Pissing" everywhere.</i>

61
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,522
No Pissing in the schoolyard!

62
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,692
<i>Even the teachers
started doing it.</i>

63
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,197
<i>Not deliberately, of course.</i>

64
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,236
So, then, what might occur
if we release gas too quickly?

65
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,527
Pissing?

66
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,246
He said "Pissing."

67
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,546
That's enough!
Order! Order!

68
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,792
<i>When we returned the next
year for our first day of school,</i>

69
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,092
<i>I was prepared.</i>

70
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,548
Present, sir.

71
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,139
Piscine Patel.

72
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,056
Good morning.
I am Piscine Molitor Patel.

73
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,233
Known to all as...

74
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,733
Pi, the sixteenth letter
of the Greek alphabet...

75
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,571
which is also used in mathematics
to represent the ratio...

76
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,237
of any circle's circumference
to its diameter.

77
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,452
An irrational number
of infinite length,

78
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,666
usually rounded
to three digits...

79
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,369
as 3.14.

80
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,082
Pi.

81
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:24,589
Very impressive, Pi.
Now, sit down.

82
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,767
<i>And from then on,
you were "Pi"?</i>

83
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,471
<i>Well, no, not quite.</i>

84
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,689
Nice try, Pissing.

85
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,686
<i>But I still had the whole
day ahead of me.</i>

86
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,445
<i>French class was next.</i>

87
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,777
<i>Je m'appelle</i>
Piscine Molitor Patel.

88
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,616
<i>Dit Pi.</i>

89
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,320
<i>Then, geography.</i>

90
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:52,116
These are the first
20 decimal places of pi.

91
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,286
<i>My last class of the
day was mathematics.</i>

92
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,877
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

93
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:11,306
Three.
Seven. Five. Eight. Nine.

94
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:16,144
Eight. Five. Eight. Nine.

95
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,150
It's right.
He's really doing this.

96
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,734
Pi! Pi! Pi!

97
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:27,823
<i>By the end of that day,
I was Pi Patel, school legend.</i>

98
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,577
Um, Mamaji tells me you're a
legend among sailors, too.

99
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,872
Out there, all alone.

100
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,205
Oh, I don't even know
how to sail.

101
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,496
And I wasn't alone out there.
Richard Parker was with me.

102
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,374
Richard Parker?

103
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,042
Mamaji didn't tell me
everything.

104
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,053
He just said I should look you
up when I got back to Montreal.

105
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,055
So, what were you
doing in Pondicherry?

106
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,346
Writing a novel.

107
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,352
By the way,
I enjoyed your first book.

108
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,018
So, this new one,
is it set in India?

109
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,684
No, Portugal, actually. But
it's cheaper living in India.

110
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,442
Ah, well, I look
forward to reading it.

111
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,569
You can't.

112
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,950
I threw it out.

113
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,950
Two years trying to bring
this thing to life...

114
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,952
and then one day, it
sputtered, coughed and died.

115
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,618
Oh, I'm sorry.

116
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,957
Uh, I was sitting in this coffee
house in Pondicherry one afternoon,

117
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,165
mourning my loss...

118
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:28,095
when this old man at the table next
to me struck up a conversation.

119
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,929
Yeah, Mamaji, he does that.

120
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,088
When I told him about my
abandoned book, he said...

121
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,309
"So, a
Canadian who's come to French India

122
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,057
in search of a story."

123
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,268
"Well, my friend, I know an
Indian in French Canada...

124
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,229
with the most
incredible story to tell."

125
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:46,568
"It must be fate that the
two of you should meet."

126
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,111
Well, I haven't spoken about
Richard Parker in so many years.

127
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,906
So, what has
Mamaji already told you?

128
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,667
He said you had a story that
would make me believe in God.

129
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,251
He would
say that about a nice meal.

130
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,258
As for God, I can only
tell you my story.

131
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,095
You will decide for yourself
what you believe.

132
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,927
Fair enough.

133
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,017
Let's see, then.
Where to begin?

134
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,311
Pondicherry is the
French Riviera of India.

135
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,399
<i>In the streets
closest to the ocean,</i>

136
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,197
<i>you might think you were
in the south of France.</i>

137
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,783
<i>A few blocks inland,
there's a canal.</i>

138
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,289
<i>Just beyond that
is Indian Pondicherry.</i>

139
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,832
<i>And the Muslim quarter
is just to the west.</i>

140
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,464
When the French handed Pondicherry
back to us in 1954...

141
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,127
the town decided that some sort
of commemoration was in order.

142
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:54,131
<i>My father, who was a clever
businessman, came up with one.</i>

143
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,722
<i>He ran a hotel, and he got
the idea to open a zoo...</i>

144
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,683
<i>in the local
botanical gardens instead.</i>

145
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:07,022
<i>As it also happened, my mother
was a botanist in the gardens.</i>

146
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:11,907
<i>They met, married, and a year
later my brother Ravi was born.</i>

147
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,238
<i>I came two years after that.</i>

148
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,409
It sounds magical,
growing up in...

149
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,537
Amen.

150
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,172
Yeah, let's eat.

151
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,171
I didn't know
Hindus said "amen."

152
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,676
Catholic Hindus do.

153
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,926
Catholic Hindus?

154
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,007
We get to feel guilty before hundreds
of gods, instead of just one.

155
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,427
But you're a Hindu first?

156
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,563
None of us knows God
until someone introduces us.

157
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,520
I was first introduced
to God as a Hindu.

158
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,277
There are 33 million gods
in the Hindu religion.

159
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,529
How can I not come to
know a few of them?

160
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,277
<i>I met Krishna first.</i>

161
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,238
Yashoda once accused
baby Krishna of eating dirt.

162
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,080
"Tut, tut you naughty boy -
you shouldn't do that."

163
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,292
But he didn't!

164
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,840
That's what he told her.

165
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,925
"I didn't eat dirt."

166
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,721
Yashoda said,
"No? Well then..."

167
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,049
"Open your mouth."

168
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,968
So Krishna opened his mouth.

169
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,137
And what do you think
Yashoda saw?

170
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,437
What?

171
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:33,822
She saw in Krishna's mouth
the whole entire universe.

172
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,139
<i>The gods were my
superheroes growing up.</i>

173
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,600
<i>Hanuman, the monkey god...</i>

174
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,609
<i>lifting an entire mountain
to save his friend Lakshman.</i>

175
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,111
<i>Ganesh, the elephant-headed...</i>

176
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,524
<i>risking his life to defend the
honor of his mother, Parvati.</i>

177
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:22,780
<i>Vishnu, the supreme soul,
the source of all things.</i>

178
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,867
<i>Vishnu sleeps, floating on the
shoreless cosmic ocean...</i>

179
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,957
<i>and we are
the stuff of his dreaming.</i>

180
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,331
Spectacle.

181
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,795
Don't let these stories and
pretty lights fool you, boys.

182
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,056
<i>Religion is darkness.</i>

183
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,854
<i>My dear appa believed
himself part of the new India.</i>

184
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,977
<i>As a child, he had had polio.</i>

185
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,361
<i>He used to lie in bed racked with
pain, wondering where God was.</i>

186
00:14:56,187 --> 00:15:00,363
<i>In the end, God didn't save
him, Western medicine did.</i>

187
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,155
<i>My amma went to college...</i>

188
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,165
<i>and thought her family was part
of the new India as well...</i>

189
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,997
<i>until her parents
cut her off...</i>

190
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,537
<i>because they thought
she was marrying beneath her.</i>

191
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,418
<i>Her religion was the only
link she had to her past.</i>

192
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,726
<i>I met Christ in the
mountains when I was 12.</i>

193
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,609
<i>We were visiting relatives,
tea growers in Munnar.</i>

194
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:39,022
<i>It was our third day there.
Ravi and I were terribly bored.</i>

195
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,112
Challenge.
I'll give you two rupees.

196
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,449
Run in to that church
and drink the holy water.

197
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,202
You must be thirsty.

198
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,453
Here.

199
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,414
I brought you this.

200
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,470
Why would a god do that?

201
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,764
Why would
He send His own son...

202
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,309
to suffer for the sins
of ordinary people?

203
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,443
Because He loves us.

204
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,814
God made Himself
approachable to us,

205
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,613
human,
so we could understand Him.

206
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,369
We can't understand God
in all His perfection.

207
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,122
But we can understand God's son

208
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,874
and His suffering
as we would a brother's.

209
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,335
That made no sense.

210
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:20,965
Sacrificing the innocent to atone
for the sins of the guilty...

211
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,125
What kind of love is that?

212
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,638
<i>But this son...</i>

213
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,299
<i>I couldn't get
him out of my head.</i>

214
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,472
<i>If God is so
perfect and we are not...</i>

215
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,687
why would He want
to create all this?

216
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,227
Why does He need us at all?

217
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,523
All you have to know
is that He loves us.

218
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,905
God so loved this world
that He gave His only son.

219
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,035
<i>The longer
I listened to the priest...</i>

220
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,198
<i>the more I came to like
this son of God.</i>

221
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:57,335
Thank you, Vishnu,
for introducing me to Christ.

222
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,128
<i>I came to faith
through Hinduism</i>

223
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,506
<i>and I found God's
love through Christ.</i>

224
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,175
<i>But God wasn't
finished with me yet.</i>

225
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,862
<i>God works in mysterious ways.</i>

226
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,524
<i>And so it was,
He introduced Himself again.</i>

227
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,406
<i>This time by the name of Allah.</i>

228
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,710
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

229
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,552
<i>My Arabic
was never very good...</i>

230
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,390
<i>but the sound and feel of the
words brought me closer to God.</i>

231
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,769
<i>In performing Salah...</i>

232
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,101
<i>the ground I touched
became holy ground...</i>

233
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,734
<i>and I found a feeling
of serenity and brotherhood.</i>

234
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,072
This lamb is exquisite.

235
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,791
It's the best
dish on the table.

236
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,959
You're all missing out.

237
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,585
You only need to convert to three
more religions, Piscine...

238
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,922
and you will spend your life on holiday.

239
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,422
Are you going to Mecca
this year, Swami Jesus?

240
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,842
Or to Rome for your
coronation as Pope Pi-us?

241
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,765
You stay out of this, Ravi.

242
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,021
Just as you like cricket,
Pi has his own interests.

243
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,432
No, Gita, Ravi has a point.

244
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:47,153
You cannot follow three different
religions at the same time, Piscine.

245
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,608
Why not?

246
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,366
Because believing in
everything at the same time...

247
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,779
is the same as not believing
in anything at all.

248
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,119
He's young, Santosh.
He's still finding his way.

249
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,706
And how can he find his way
if he does not choose a path?

250
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,832
Listen, instead of leaping from
one religion to the next...

251
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,000
why not start with reason?

252
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,007
In a few hundred years...

253
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,888
science has taken us farther in
understanding the universe...

254
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,800
than religion has in 10,000.

255
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,350
That is true.

256
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,809
Your father is right.

257
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,518
Science can teach us more
about what is out there...

258
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,482
but not what is in here.

259
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,194
Some eat meat,
some eat vegetable.

260
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,700
I do not expect us all
to agree about everything...

261
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,702
but I would much
rather have you

262
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,529
believe in something
I don't agree with...

263
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,495
than to accept
everything blindly.

264
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,503
And that begins
with thinking rationally.

265
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,669
Do you understand?

266
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,551
Good.

267
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,430
I would like to be baptized.

268
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,435
So, you're a Christian
and a Muslim?

269
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,024
And a Hindu, of course.

270
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,359
And a Jew, I suppose.

271
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,525
Well, I do teach a course on the
Kabbalah at the university.

272
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,365
And why not? Faith is a
house with many rooms.

273
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,120
But no room for doubt?

274
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,952
Oh, plenty.
On every floor.

275
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,536
Doubt is useful.

276
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,747
It keeps faith a living thing.

277
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,083
After all, you cannot know
the strength of your faith

278
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,379
until it's been tested.

279
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,212
Where's Selvam? We shouldn't
be in here without him.

280
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,880
Stop worrying.

281
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,392
I have seen him
do this a thousand times.

282
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,766
I want to meet our new tiger.

283
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:49,813
Pi!

284
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,566
Hello? Richard Parker?

285
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,941
A tiger? Richard
Parker was a tiger?

286
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,950
Yeah, he got his name
through a clerical error.

287
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,113
A hunter caught him drinking from
a stream when he was a cub...

288
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,077
and named him Thirsty.

289
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,244
When Thirsty got too big, the
hunter sold him to our zoo...

290
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,253
but the names got switched on
the paperwork.

291
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,873
The hunter was listed
as Thirsty,

292
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,834
and the tiger
was called Richard Parker.

293
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,637
We laughed about it,
and the name stuck.

294
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,506
Let's go...

295
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,476
before we get into trouble.

296
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,477
I want to see him close up.

297
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,104
You're not a zookeeper.

298
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,106
Come on!

299
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,622
That's it, Richard Parker.

300
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,503
It's for you.

301
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:21,984
No!

302
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,321
What are you thinking?

303
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,164
Are you out of your mind?

304
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,371
Who gave you permission
to come back here?

305
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,912
You have just ignored everything
I've ever taught you.

306
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,256
I just wanted to
say hello to him.

307
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,505
You think that tiger
is your friend?

308
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,011
He's an animal, not a playmate.

309
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,344
Animals have souls.

310
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,850
I have seen it in their eyes.

311
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,097
Find Selvam.

312
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,777
You're sure, Sir?
Pi's just a boy.

313
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,862
Do it. Go ahead!

314
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,537
Animals do not think
like we do.

315
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,543
People who forget that
get themselves killed.

316
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,878
That tiger is not your friend.

317
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,542
When you look into his eyes...

318
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:23,133
you are seeing your own
emotions reflected back at you.

319
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,047
Nothing else.

320
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,141
Don't be stupid.
Say you're sorry.

321
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,761
What have you done, Piscine?

322
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,226
You know what your father
said about coming back here.

323
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,234
I am sorry. I was...

324
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,148
What are you thinking?

325
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,063
This is between
a father and his sons.

326
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,317
He said he's sorry.

327
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,951
You want to scar them for life?

328
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,080
Scar them?
That boy almost lost his arm.

329
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,581
But he's still a boy.

330
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,457
He will be a man
sooner than you think.

331
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,586
And this is a lesson I do not
want them ever to forget.

332
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,750
Selvam!

333
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,756
<i>...and so has placed
the country in a state of emergency.</i>

334
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,139
<i>Under the directive, the states
of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu...</i>

335
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,350
<i>will be placed under the direct
authority of the central government.</i>

336
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,230
<i>Police will be granted powers...</i>

337
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,733
<i>to arrest and indefinitely
detain citizens</i>

338
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,526
<i>responsible for the uprising.</i>

339
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,820
<i>Things changed after
the day of Appa's lesson.</i>

340
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,659
<i>The world had lost
some of its enchantment.</i>

341
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:16,830
<i>School was a bore. Nothing but
facts, fractions and French.</i>

342
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,417
<i>Words and patterns that went
on and on, without end.</i>

343
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,083
<i>Just like
my irrational nickname.</i>

344
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,553
<i>I grew restless
searching for something</i>

345
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,267
<i>that might bring meaning
back into my life.</i>

346
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,101
<i>And then, I met Anandi.</i>

347
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,862
<i>Mother made me study music.</i>

348
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,447
<i>And one day, my teacher
came down with the flu.</i>

349
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,745
<i>He asked if
I could take his place,</i>

350
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,619
<i>playing rhythms
for a dance class.</i>

351
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,097
No.

352
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,217
If you do not concentrate...

353
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,763
you cannot express your
love of God through dance.

354
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,057
Feel the ground
beneath your feet.

355
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,726
Open your gaze out
onto the horizon.

356
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:28,443
Let that spiritual energy pulse
through you and out into the world.

357
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,570
Through <i>abhinaya</i>.

358
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,827
Anandi, come to the front.
Lead them.

359
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,616
Why are you following me?

360
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,874
What?

361
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,662
You were following me.

362
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,133
What does this mean?

363
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,219
In the dance,
you went from pataka...

364
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,843
which means the forest.

365
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,805
And then you did...

366
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,353
<i>samputa...</i>

367
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,185
which means
something that is hidden.

368
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,975
And after that, you did this.

369
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,195
And then you did <i>chatura.</i>

370
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,904
But at the very end,
you did this.

371
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,323
None of the other
dancers did that.

372
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,656
What did you mean? The god of
love is hiding in the forest?

373
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,666
No, that also means
the lotus flower.

374
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,499
Lotus flower
is hiding in the forest?

375
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,416
Why would a lotus flower
hide in the forest?

376
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,434
And this is Richard Parker.

377
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,807
He is the most
magnificent creature

378
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,513
we've ever had here.

379
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,691
Look at the way
he's turning his head.

380
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,900
Showing off. Like a dancer.

381
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,361
No, he heard something.

382
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,329
He's listening, you see?

383
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,873
We have talked
about it for some time.

384
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,213
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

385
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,719
Pi?

386
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,714
Sorry, you've been...

387
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,427
Worried.

388
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,388
For my family.

389
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,555
Our animals are worth far more
abroad than here in India.

390
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,723
And if the town council
stops supporting us...

391
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,732
I don't know where we will be.

392
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,269
So, it is what we have to do.

393
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,151
Do you understand?

394
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,234
I'm sorry,
what are we talking about?

395
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,820
We are leaving India.

396
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,657
What?

397
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,248
We are selling the zoo.

398
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,123
The zoo was never ours to sell.
The land belongs to the town.

399
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,417
But the animals are ours
and if we sell them...

400
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,677
we will have enough
to start a new life.

401
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,089
But where would we go?
Our life is here, <i>Appa.</i>

402
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,256
Canada.

403
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,097
I have some opportunities
for work in Winnipeg.

404
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,263
I'll be shipping most of the
animals for sale in North America.

405
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,978
We can get freighter passage
for the whole family.

406
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,600
So...

407
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,360
It is settled.

408
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,271
We will sail like Columbus.

409
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,529
But Columbus
was looking for India.

410
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,869
<i>It takes
a lot of work to sell a zoo.</i>

411
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,712
<i>Before we left...</i>

412
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:16,509
<i>Anandi and I had time enough
to break each other's hearts.</i>

413
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,337
<i>Of course, I promised
I would come back one day.</i>

414
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:22,673
<i>It's funny.</i>

415
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,968
<i>I remember everything else
about our last day.</i>

416
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,229
<i>But I don't remember
saying goodbye.</i>

417
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:41,196
Pi? They're
serving dinner below.

418
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,002
Piscine...

419
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,667
you have a whole life
ahead of you.

420
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,012
We are doing this
for you and Ravi.

421
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,384
Come inside
and have some dinner.

422
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,690
Vegetarian, please.

423
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,899
Oh, my sons and I are vegetarians.
Do you have anything...

424
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,194
No, no, no.
Not more gravy.

425
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,112
You don't want gravy?
No.

426
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,240
No, I want something
vegetarian.

427
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,576
Oh.

428
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,711
<i>Pas de problème.</i>

429
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,260
She asked if you have
something vegetarian.

430
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,056
The cow that produced
this liver was vegetarian,

431
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,138
the pigs that went into
these sausages were vegetarian.

432
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,594
Very funny.

433
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,063
But my wife doesn't eat liver.

434
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,523
<i>Pas de problème.</i>

435
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:02,489
Then she can eat the sausage,
the rice, and the gravy.

436
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,983
Or you can cook your own food.

437
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,820
Haw dare you talk
to my wife like that?

438
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,285
Here's your rice.

439
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,076
I cook for sailors...

440
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,752
not curry-eaters.

441
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,412
What did you say?

442
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:18,463
Let go of me!

443
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:22,133
Who do you think you are?
You're nothing but a servant!

444
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,758
I feed people!
You feed monkeys!

445
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,930
Hello.

446
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,643
I am happy Buddhist.

447
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,600
So, I eat rice

448
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,606
next to gravy.

449
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:44,315
On ship, gravy is not meat.

450
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,653
Is taste.

451
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,701
You try?

452
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,384
Don't worry.

453
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:17,682
We will have plenty of fresh
supplies after we stop in Manila.

454
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:23,146
Why give Orange Juice
tranquilizers?

455
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,235
She's not going to
cause any trouble.

456
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,368
The stress of traveling
is not good for the animals...

457
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,325
and it helps
with the seasickness.

458
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:39,666
We don't want to be cleaning up
after a seasick orangutan...

459
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,497
do we?

460
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,047
<i>My father was a businessman.</i>

461
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,553
<i>He had never tended
the animals himself.</i>

462
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:55,431
I realized...

463
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,565
leaving India must have been
harder for him than it was for me.

464
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,780
So...

465
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,403
Have I forgotten anything?

466
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,726
I think you've set the stage.

467
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,238
So far, we have an Indian boy named
after a French swimming pool...

468
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,704
on a Japanese ship full of
animals, heading to Canada.

469
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,118
Yes.

470
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:23,039
Now, we have to send our boy into
the middle of the Pacific and...

471
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,208
And make me believe in God.

472
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,086
Yeah.

473
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,129
We'll get there.

474
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,766
It was four days
out of Manila...

475
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,057
above the Mariana Trench,
the deepest spot on Earth.

476
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,697
<i>Our ship,
The Tsimtsum, pushed on,</i>

477
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,817
<i>bullishly indifferent
to its surroundings.</i>

478
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:57,156
<i>It moved with the slow, massive
confidence of a continent.</i>

479
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,825
Ravi?

480
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,953
Did you hear that, Ravi?

481
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,329
I'm sleeping.

482
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,490
It's a thunderstorm.
Let's go watch.

483
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:41,954
Are you crazy?

484
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,210
We will get hit by lightning.

485
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,296
No, we won't. It will
hit the bridge first.

486
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,168
Don't tempt a storm, Pi.

487
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,936
Whoa.

488
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,655
Oh!

489
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,952
More rain! More rain!

490
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,957
Lord of Storms!

491
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,583
Whoa!

492
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,998
Lightning!

493
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,055
Ah!

494
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,085
<i>Amma!</i>

495
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,503
<i>Appa!</i>

496
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,802
Ravi! Get out! Get out!

497
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,423
Help me!

498
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,972
Help!

499
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,471
Get in the boat!

500
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,636
Please! Save my family!

501
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,601
Don't scare, okay?
Wait, stay here!

502
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,356
You have to help them!
Please!

503
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,812
Put this on.

504
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,398
No, no, my family!
Please!

505
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,152
We have to help them!

506
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,613
We don't have time.
My family's back there!

507
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,028
We help!
You must go!

508
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,366
Who let all the animals out?

509
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,781
You have to go now!

510
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,245
No, wait, my father!
He can't swim!

511
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,372
Go!

512
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,257
Hang on to the boat!
Hold, hold!

513
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,092
Bring it down!

514
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:31,013
Hey! You!
What are you doing?

515
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,686
Jump!

516
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,059
Hey, hey!

517
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:43,464
Hey! Over here!
Over here!

518
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,837
Richard Parker?

519
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,669
No! No!

520
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:25,756
No! Go away! Go away!

521
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,237
Agh!

522
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,718
<i>Amma!</i>

523
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,855
<i>Appa!</i> Ravi.

524
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,233
I'm sorry.

525
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:51,861
I'm sorry!

526
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,301
Hari?

527
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,836
Looks as though your drugs
haven't worn off yet.

528
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:33,860
Orange Juice!
Orange Juice!

529
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,367
Welcome to Pi's Ark.

530
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,485
Where is your boy,
Orange Juice?

531
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:30,909
Don't worry, I bet mother
and father found him.

532
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,877
They'll all be here soon.

533
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,224
Hello!

534
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,018
Hello!

535
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,106
Anybody!

536
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,584
No!

537
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:07,964
Stop it! No!
Stop it! Stop it!

538
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:11,466
No! No!

539
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,563
I'm sorry, Orange Juice.

540
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,900
I don't have any seasickness
medicine for you.

541
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,117
Supplies.
Oh, supplies!

542
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,100
Yes! Yes!

543
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,737
No! No!

544
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,573
No! No!

545
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:57,133
Come on! Come on!

546
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,013
Come on!

547
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,451
Mmm.

548
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,215
<i>My name is Pi Patel.</i>

549
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,214
<i>I have been in a shipwreck.</i>

550
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,555
<i>I am on a lifeboat alone...</i>

551
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,055
<i>with a tiger.</i>

552
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:58,058
<i>Please send help.</i>

553
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,886
God, I give myself to you.

554
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,923
I am your vessel.

555
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:58,554
Whatever comes, I want to know.

556
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,357
Show me.

557
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,737
There are no lines.

558
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:23,037
<i>Set your house in order and
dig in for the battle to survive.</i>

559
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,839
<i>Establish a strict
schedule for eating,</i>

560
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:28,379
<i>keeping watch and getting rest.</i>

561
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:32,296
<i>Do not drink
urine or sea water.</i>

562
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:38,390
<i>Keep busy but avoid
unnecessary exertion.</i>

563
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,728
<i>The mind can be kept occupied
by playing card games...</i>

564
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:47,228
<i>Twenty Questions, or! Spy.</i>

565
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:54,072
<i>Community singing is another
surefire way to lift the spirits.</i>

566
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,827
<i>Telling stories
is highly recommended.</i>

567
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,959
<i>Above all, don't lose hope.</i>

568
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:19,180
<i>Few things can sap the spirit
faster than seasickness.</i>

569
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:25,191
<i>Waves are most strongly felt when a
boat turns sideways to the current.</i>

570
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:29,979
<i>A sea anchor is used as a drag to
keep the boat's head to the wind.</i>

571
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,819
<i>Proper use of them
can increase control</i>

572
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,613
<i>and reduce seasickness
during rough seas.</i>

573
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,742
<i>For castaways who must share
their lifeboats with large,</i>

574
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,198
<i>dangerous carnivores...</i>

575
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:44,660
<i>it's advisable to establish
a territory as your own.</i>

576
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,328
<i>Try this method.</i>

577
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,586
<i>Step one.</i>

578
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,791
<i>Choose a day when waves are
moderate, but regular.</i>

579
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:54,170
<i>Step two. With the lifeboat
facing into the waves...</i>

580
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:58,800
<i>making the ride as comfortable as
possible, blow your whistle soothingly.</i>

581
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,511
<i>Step three. Turn the lifeboat
sideways to the waves...</i>

582
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:05,856
<i>accompanied by harsh,
aggressive use of the whistle.</i>

583
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,641
<i>With sufficient repetition...</i>

584
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,935
<i>the animal will associate
the sound of the whistle...</i>

585
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:12,567
<i>with the discomfort
of seasickness.</i>

586
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,404
<i>Similar methods have long been
used by circus trainers...</i>

587
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,661
<i>though they generally lack
access to rough seas.</i>

588
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:22,827
Let the trumpets blare!

589
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:26,744
Let the drum rolls begin!

590
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,171
Prepare to be amazed!

591
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:34,551
Here it is, for your
enjoyment and instruction!

592
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:39,514
The show you've been waiting
for all your life...

593
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,643
will soon begin!

594
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,267
Are you ready for
the miracle of it?

595
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,434
Well, then, I give to you...

596
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,026
the astounding Bengal tiger!

597
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:10,379
Hello, Richard Parker.
Sorry about the choppy ride.

598
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:49,285
Mine! You understand?
Yours, mine!

599
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,422
You understand?

600
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,424
Ew!

601
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,095
<i>Step four.</i>

602
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,856
<i>Disregard steps
one through three.</i>

603
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:43,968
Here, Richard Parker.
I got some water for you.

604
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:02,317
<i>In the zoo, we fed our tigers an
average of five kilos of meat a day.</i>

605
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:06,028
<i>Richard Parker
will be getting hungry soon.</i>

606
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,575
<i>Tigers are powerful swimmers,
and if he gets hungry enough...</i>

607
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,752
<i>I'm afraid the little
bit of water between us</i>

608
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,875
<i>won't be any protection.</i>

609
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,540
<i>I need to find a way
to feed him.</i>

610
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:22,256
<i>I can eat the biscuits but God
made tigers carnivores...</i>

611
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,508
<i>so I must learn to catch fish.</i>

612
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,390
<i>If I don't,
I'm afraid his last meal</i>

613
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,684
<i>will be a skinny,
vegetarian boy.</i>

614
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,567
Patience!

615
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:49,654
What am I doing?

616
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,216
Wait! I'm thinking.

617
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,808
Thirty-two cartons
of biscuits.

618
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,608
Ninety-three cans of water.

619
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,345
I'm sorry.

620
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,678
I'm sorry.

621
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:10,601
Thank you, Lord Vishnu.

622
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:14,897
Thank you for coming in the form
of a fish and saving our lives.

623
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,695
Thank you.

624
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:28,405
<i>Of course, I brought all
the biscuits and water</i>

625
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:31,081
<i>on the raft with me
to keep them safe.</i>

626
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,496
<i>Idiot.</i>

627
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,256
<i>Hunger can
change everything you</i>

628
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,584
<i>ever thought you
knew about yourself.</i>

629
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,764
Here, it's yours!

630
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,318
Oh! Ah!

631
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,172
Mine! Mine!

632
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,815
<i>I can't risk my life every time</i>

633
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:53,697
<i>I have to climb
onto the boat for supplies.</i>

634
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:56,032
<i>It's time to settle this.</i>

635
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,076
<i>If we're going
to live together,</i>

636
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,704
<i>we have to learn
to communicate.</i>

637
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,494
<i>Maybe Richard Parker
can't be tamed,</i>

638
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:06,376
<i>but with God's will,
he can be trained.</i>

639
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:17,364
No!

640
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:27,791
Good.

641
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:49,953
Go, Richard Parker. Go.

642
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:52,918
Go on home,
I'll leave you alone.

643
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,050
I'll respect that, I promise.

644
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:02,715
Go. Come on.

645
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,391
Yes!

646
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:49,019
<i>I never thought
a small piece of shade</i>

647
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,813
<i>could bring me
so much happiness.</i>

648
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:57,275
<i>That a pile of tools,
a bucket, a knife, a pencil...</i>

649
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,484
<i>might become my
greatest treasures.</i>

650
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:03,784
<i>Or that knowing Richard Parker was
here might ever bring me peace.</i>

651
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,286
<i>In times like these...</i>

652
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:08,698
<i>I remember that he has
as little experience</i>

653
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:11,330
<i>with the real world as I do.</i>

654
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:14,837
<i>We were both raised in a zoo
by the same master.</i>

655
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:19,967
<i>Now we've been orphaned, left to
face our ultimate master together.</i>

656
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:23,675
<i>Without Richard Parker,
I would have died by now.</i>

657
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,181
<i>My fear of him keeps me alert.</i>

658
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,640
<i>Tending to his needs
gives my life purpose.</i>

659
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,062
Dolphins.

660
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,353
Hey, Richard Parker!

661
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,413
Hey!

662
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:53,720
<i>Above all, don't lose hope.</i>

663
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:29,634
Eight, five, five,
zero, three, six, six...

664
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:32,304
zero, eight, zero, one...

665
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:37,267
three, six, zero, four,
six, six, eight...

666
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:47,481
What are you looking at?

667
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:54,029
Talk to me.

668
01:23:57,658 --> 01:23:59,877
Tell me what you see.

669
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:10,090
<i>Words are all I have
left to hang on to.</i>

670
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:14,011
<i>Everything mixed up.
Fragmented.</i>

671
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:19,763
<i>Can't tell daydreams, night
dreams, from reality anymo...</i>

672
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,945
Storm, Richard Parker.

673
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:08,815
No!

674
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:15,564
No!

675
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:42,386
Praise be to God!

676
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,059
Lord of all worlds!

677
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:48,848
The compassionate,
the merciful!

678
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,227
Ah!

679
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:57,189
Come out.

680
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:02,866
Richard Parker! Come out,
you have to see this!

681
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:05,864
It's beautiful!

682
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:21,051
Don't hide yourself!
He's come to us!

683
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:22,886
It's a miracle!

684
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:40,073
Come out and see God,
Richard Parker!

685
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:56,082
Why are you scaring him?

686
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:57,249
Oh, God!

687
01:28:57,415 --> 01:29:02,091
I've lost my family!
I've lost everything!

688
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:06,680
I surrender!
What more do you want?

689
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:32,334
I'm sorry, Richard Parker.

690
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:42,934
We're dying, Richard Parker.

691
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:49,147
I'm sorry.

692
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:25,855
<i>Amma, Appa,</i> Ravi...

693
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:31,194
I'm happy I'm going
to see you soon.

694
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:42,994
Can you feel the rain?

695
01:34:01,511 --> 01:34:06,392
God, thank you for
giving me my life.

696
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,562
I'm ready now.

697
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,770
Richard Parker?

698
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:33,691
Mmm.

699
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,199
Excuse me.

700
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:26,664
Move.

701
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:29,868
Move. Excuse me.

702
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:44,469
Hey! Hey!

703
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:46,838
Hey, come on!

704
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:50,842
Hey.

705
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:55,268
Hey, get away.
This is my bed.

706
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,897
<i>It was a human tooth?</i>

707
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:09,155
Don't you see? The
island was carnivorous.

708
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:12,157
Carnivorous?
Like a Venus Flytrap?

709
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:15,160
Yes, the whole island.

710
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:19,790
The plants, the water in those
pools, the very ground itself.

711
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:23,461
During the day, those
pools held fresh water.

712
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:25,747
But at night,
some chemical process

713
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:28,834
turned the water
in those pools into acid...

714
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:32,011
acid that dissolved
those fish...

715
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:34,672
that sent the meerkats
scurrying into the trees,

716
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:36,974
and Richard Parker
running to the boat.

717
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:39,135
But where did
the tooth come from?

718
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:42,101
Years ago, some poor fellow,
just like me...

719
01:41:42,263 --> 01:41:45,016
must have found himself
stranded on that island...

720
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:48,527
and, like me, thought he
might stay there forever.

721
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:53,533
But all that the island gave him by
day, it took away again by night.

722
01:41:55,026 --> 01:42:00,203
To think, how many hours spent
with only meerkats for company.

723
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:02,787
How much loneliness taken on.

724
01:42:03,159 --> 01:42:05,378
All I know is that
eventually he died

725
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:07,455
and the island digested him...

726
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:10,375
leaving behind only his teeth.

727
01:42:11,709 --> 01:42:15,179
I saw how my life would end
if I stayed on that island.

728
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:17,056
Alone and forgotten.

729
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:22,558
I had to get back to the
world, or die trying.

730
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:29,189
<i>I spent the next day
preparing the boat.</i>

731
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:31,400
<i>I filled my stores
with fresh water...</i>

732
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:34,240
<i>ate seaweed until my stomach
could take no more...</i>

733
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:36,742
<i>and brought as many
meerkats as I could fit</i>

734
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:39,912
<i>into the storage locker
for Richard Parker.</i>

735
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:43,166
<i>I couldn't leave
without him, of course.</i>

736
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:45,167
<i>It would mean killing him.</i>

737
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:49,881
<i>And so,
I waited for his return.</i>

738
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:53,922
<i>I knew he wouldn't be late.</i>

739
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:57,589
Richard Parker!

740
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:12,437
<i>No one has seen that
floating island since.</i>

741
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:15,903
<i>And you won't read about those
trees in any nature book.</i>

742
01:43:16,065 --> 01:43:20,115
<i>And yet, if I hadn't found those
shores, I would have died.</i>

743
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:22,621
<i>If I hadn't
discovered that tooth,</i>

744
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:25,792
<i>I would have been lost,
alone forever.</i>

745
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:28,453
<i>Even when God seemed
to have abandoned me...</i>

746
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:30,121
<i>He was watching.</i>

747
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:33,086
<i>Even when He seemed indifferent
to my suffering...</i>

748
01:43:33,249 --> 01:43:34,717
<i>He was watching.</i>

749
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:38,721
<i>And when I was beyond all hope
of saving, He gave me rest...</i>

750
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:41,974
<i>then gave me a sign
to continue my journey.</i>

751
01:43:54,812 --> 01:43:57,361
<i>By the time we reached
the Mexican shore,</i>

752
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,239
<i>I was afraid to
let go of the boat.</i>

753
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:04,155
<i>My strength was gone.
I was so weak.</i>

754
01:44:04,321 --> 01:44:08,121
<i>I was afraid that in two feet of
water, so close to deliverance...</i>

755
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:10,332
<i>I would drown.</i>

756
01:44:19,587 --> 01:44:23,592
<i>I struggled to shore
and fell upon the sand.</i>

757
01:44:23,758 --> 01:44:25,510
<i>It was warm and soft...</i>

758
01:44:25,676 --> 01:44:28,976
<i>like pressing my face
against the cheek of God.</i>

759
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:34,353
<i>And somewhere, two eyes were
smiling at having me there.</i>

760
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:42,110
<i>I was so spent,
I could hardly move.</i>

761
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:51,289
<i>And so, Richard Parker
went ahead of me.</i>

762
01:44:52,661 --> 01:44:56,711
<i>He stretched his legs
and walked along the shore.</i>

763
01:45:00,461 --> 01:45:03,715
<i>At the edge of the jungle,
he stopped.</i>

764
01:45:03,881 --> 01:45:06,350
<i>I was certain he was going
to look back at me...</i>

765
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:09,729
<i>flatten his ears
to his head, growl.</i>

766
01:45:09,887 --> 01:45:13,983
<i>That he would bring our
relationship to an end in some way.</i>

767
01:45:15,893 --> 01:45:19,067
<i>But he just stared ahead
into the jungle.</i>

768
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:25,244
And then, Richard Parker,
my fierce companion...

769
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:28,076
the terrible one
who kept me alive...

770
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:34,496
disappeared
forever from my life.

771
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:44,005
<i>After a few hours, a member
of my own species found me.</i>

772
01:45:44,505 --> 01:45:47,600
<i>He left and returned with a
group who carried me away.</i>

773
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,058
<i>I wept like a child.</i>

774
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:56,567
<i>Not because I was overwhelmed at
having survived, although I was.</i>

775
01:45:57,434 --> 01:46:03,612
<i>I was weeping because Richard
Parker left me so unceremoniously.</i>

776
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:07,616
<i>It broke my heart.</i>

777
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:15,954
You know, my father was right.

778
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,873
Richard Parker never
saw me as his friend.

779
01:46:19,456 --> 01:46:23,381
After all we had been through,
he didn't even look back.

780
01:46:24,545 --> 01:46:26,545
But I have to believe there
was more in his eyes...

781
01:46:26,589 --> 01:46:29,593
than my own reflection
staring back at me.

782
01:46:29,758 --> 01:46:32,056
I know it.
I felt it.

783
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:35,147
Even if I can't prove it.

784
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:41,938
You know,
I've left so much behind.

785
01:46:42,104 --> 01:46:45,483
My family, the zoo,
India, Anandi.

786
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:49,912
I suppose, in the end, the whole of
life becomes an act of letting go.

787
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:53,498
But what always
hurts the most...

788
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:57,287
is not taking a moment
to say goodbye.

789
01:46:58,996 --> 01:47:03,172
I was never able to thank my
father for all I learned from him.

790
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:06,338
To tell him,
without his lessons...

791
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,174
I would never have survived.

792
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,975
I know Richard Parker is a
tiger, but I wish I had said...

793
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:17,811
"It's over.
We survived."

794
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:21,773
"Thank you for saving my life.
I love you, Richard Parker."

795
01:47:21,936 --> 01:47:24,655
"You will always
be with me."

796
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,534
"May God be with you."

797
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:38,043
I don't know what to say.

798
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:46,969
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

799
01:47:49,964 --> 01:47:52,183
It is a lot to take in.

800
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:55,302
To figure out
what it all means.

801
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:56,641
If it happened, it happened.

802
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,314
Why should it have
to mean anything?

803
01:48:00,849 --> 01:48:03,819
Some of it is
pretty incredible.

804
01:48:03,978 --> 01:48:06,322
See, I was the only one
who survived the shipwreck.

805
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:10,071
So the Japanese shipping company
sent two men to talk to me...

806
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:13,078
in the Mexican hospital
where I was recovering.

807
01:48:15,155 --> 01:48:17,078
I still have a copy
of their report.

808
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:22,338
They had insurance claims
to settle...

809
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:25,420
and they wanted to find out
why the ship sank.

810
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:27,885
They didn't believe me, either.

811
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:34,846
Thousands of meerkats on a
floating carnivorous island...

812
01:48:35,009 --> 01:48:36,932
and no one has ever seen it?

813
01:48:37,094 --> 01:48:39,893
Yes, just like I told you.

814
01:48:40,055 --> 01:48:41,773
Bananas don't float.

815
01:48:41,932 --> 01:48:43,434
Why are you
talking about bananas?

816
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,274
You said the orangutan floated
to you on a bundle of bananas.

817
01:48:46,437 --> 01:48:48,280
But bananas don't float.

818
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:49,782
Are you sure about that?

819
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,443
Of course they do.
Try it for yourself.

820
01:48:53,402 --> 01:48:57,578
In any case, we are not here to
talk about bananas or meerkats.

821
01:48:57,740 --> 01:49:01,085
Look, I’ve just told you along
story and I'm very tired.

822
01:49:01,243 --> 01:49:06,124
We are here because a Japanese
cargo ship sank in the Pacific.

823
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:08,759
Something I never forget.

824
01:49:09,918 --> 01:49:12,387
I lost my whole family.

825
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:18,807
Get him some water.

826
01:49:21,263 --> 01:49:23,482
We don't mean to push you.

827
01:49:24,558 --> 01:49:27,437
And you have our
deepest sympathies.

828
01:49:27,603 --> 01:49:29,605
But we have come a long way...

829
01:49:29,772 --> 01:49:32,946
and we are no closer to
understanding why the ship sank.

830
01:49:33,108 --> 01:49:35,236
Because I don't know.

831
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:36,949
I was asleep.
Something woke me up.

832
01:49:37,112 --> 01:49:39,661
It could have been an
explosion, I can't be sure.

833
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:41,746
And then the ship sank.

834
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:43,957
What else do you want from me?

835
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:46,417
A story that won't make us
look like fools.

836
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:49,584
We need a simpler story
for our report.

837
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:51,923
One our company can understand.

838
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:54,672
A story we can all believe.

839
01:49:57,508 --> 01:50:00,512
So, a story without things
you've never seen before.

840
01:50:01,011 --> 01:50:02,354
That's right.

841
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:06,689
Without surprises. Without
animals or islands.

842
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:09,524
Yes. The truth.

843
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:20,869
So, what did you do?

844
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:27,379
I told them another story.

845
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:29,377
Four of us survived.

846
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:32,798
The cook and the sailor
were already aboard.

847
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:34,928
The cook threw me a lifebuoy
and pulled me aboard...

848
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:38,637
and Mother held on to some bananas
and made it to the lifeboat.

849
01:50:40,217 --> 01:50:43,221
The cook was a disgusting man.

850
01:50:43,387 --> 01:50:45,606
He ate a rat.

851
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:48,893
We had food enough for weeks, but he
found the rat in the first few days...

852
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:52,734
and he killed it, dried
it in the sun and ate it.

853
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:55,115
He was such a brute, that man.

854
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,244
But he was resourceful.

855
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:03,575
It was his idea to build
the raft to catch fish.

856
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:06,960
We would have died in those
first few days without him.

857
01:51:09,246 --> 01:51:13,752
The sailor was the same man who
brought rice and gravy, the Buddhist.

858
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:17,296
We didn't understand much of what he
said, only that he was suffering.

859
01:51:17,754 --> 01:51:19,927
He had broken his leg
horribly in the fall.

860
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:23,185
We tried to set it as best we could,
but the leg became infected...

861
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:28,100
and the cook said that we had
to do something or he'd die.

862
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:29,646
The cook said he'd do it,

863
01:51:29,766 --> 01:51:32,110
but Mother and I had
to hold the man down.

864
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:34,780
And I believed him,
we needed to do it.

865
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:37,282
So...

866
01:51:38,942 --> 01:51:42,037
I kept saying,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

867
01:51:42,196 --> 01:51:46,042
And he just kept looking at me.
His eyes were so...

868
01:51:49,203 --> 01:51:52,673
I'll never understand the point
of that man's suffering.

869
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:56,051
I can still hear him.

870
01:51:56,793 --> 01:52:00,468
The happy Buddhist,
he only ate rice and gravy.

871
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:07,725
We didn't save him, of course.

872
01:52:07,888 --> 01:52:09,310
He died.

873
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:12,510
The morning after, the cook
caught his first dorado...

874
01:52:12,643 --> 01:52:15,692
and I didn't understand what he had
done at first, but Mother did...

875
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:18,824
and I had never seen
Mother so angry.

876
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,573
"Stop whining and
be happy," he said.

877
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:24,579
"We need more food or we'll die.
That was the whole point."

878
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:26,661
"What was the whole point?"
Mother asked.

879
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:30,919
"You let that poor boy die in
order to get bait, you monster!"

880
01:52:32,412 --> 01:52:33,584
The cook got furious.

881
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:35,666
He started towards her
with his fist raised...

882
01:52:35,832 --> 01:52:38,881
and Mother slapped him hard,
right across the face.

883
01:52:39,044 --> 01:52:40,921
I was stunned.

884
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:43,557
I thought he was going
to kill her right then.

885
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:46,760
But he didn't.

886
01:52:48,679 --> 01:52:51,398
The cook didn't stop
at bait either, no.

887
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:54,192
The sailor...

888
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:58,280
He went the same
way the rat went.

889
01:53:01,024 --> 01:53:03,527
The cook was a resourceful man.

890
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:09,871
It was a week later that he...

891
01:53:11,576 --> 01:53:13,749
Because of me.

892
01:53:13,912 --> 01:53:16,882
Because I couldn't
hold on to a stupid turtle.

893
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:19,919
It slipped out of my hands
and swam away.

894
01:53:20,085 --> 01:53:22,429
And the cook came up and he punched
me on the side of my head...

895
01:53:22,587 --> 01:53:24,806
and my teeth clacked
and I saw stars.

896
01:53:24,965 --> 01:53:26,137
I thought he was
going to hit me again...

897
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,340
but Mother started pounding
on him with her fists...

898
01:53:28,427 --> 01:53:30,225
screaming,
"Monster, monster!"

899
01:53:30,387 --> 01:53:31,855
She yelled at me
to go to the raft.

900
01:53:33,765 --> 01:53:36,564
I thought she was coming with
me, or I'd never have...

901
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:42,107
I don't know why I didn't
make her go first.

902
01:53:44,109 --> 01:53:46,453
I think about that every day.

903
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:56,167
I jumped over and turned back
just as the knife came out.

904
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:02,586
There wasn't anything
I could do.

905
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:06,423
I couldn't look away.

906
01:54:10,635 --> 01:54:13,104
He threw her body overboard.

907
01:54:14,765 --> 01:54:18,611
And then the sharks came.
And I saw what they...

908
01:54:23,315 --> 01:54:24,942
I saw.

909
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:33,625
The next day, I killed him.

910
01:54:34,785 --> 01:54:37,629
He didn't even fight back. He
knew he had gone too far...

911
01:54:37,788 --> 01:54:39,961
even by his own standards.

912
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:43,380
He'd left the knife
out on the bench,

913
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:46,634
and I did to him what
he did to the sailor.

914
01:54:49,383 --> 01:54:52,637
He was such an evil man,
but worse still, he...

915
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:57,353
He brought the evil out in me.

916
01:54:58,809 --> 01:55:01,187
And I have to live with that.

917
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:10,654
I was alone in a lifeboat...

918
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:14,374
drifting across
the Pacific Ocean.

919
01:55:15,075 --> 01:55:16,918
And I survived.

920
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:25,340
After that, they
had no more questions.

921
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:29,177
The investigators didn't seem
to like the story, exactly.

922
01:55:30,006 --> 01:55:34,512
But they thanked me, they
wished me well, and they left.

923
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:43,357
So the stories...

924
01:55:46,022 --> 01:55:48,400
both the zebra
and the sailor...

925
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,782
broke their leg.

926
01:55:51,194 --> 01:55:54,414
And the hyena killed the
zebra and the orangutan.

927
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:58,870
So... the hyena is the cook.

928
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:01,546
The sailor is the zebra.

929
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:04,591
Your mother is the orangutan.

930
01:56:04,916 --> 01:56:08,045
And you are...

931
01:56:08,879 --> 01:56:11,302
the tiger.

932
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:17,100
Can I ask you something?

933
01:56:18,597 --> 01:56:20,440
Of course.

934
01:56:20,599 --> 01:56:24,445
I've told you two stories about
what happened out on the ocean.

935
01:56:24,603 --> 01:56:27,903
Neither explains what caused
the sinking of the ship...

936
01:56:28,064 --> 01:56:32,240
and no one can prove which story
is true and which is not.

937
01:56:32,402 --> 01:56:35,747
In both stories,
the ship sinks...

938
01:56:35,906 --> 01:56:38,830
my family dies and I suffer.

939
01:56:39,284 --> 01:56:40,752
True.

940
01:56:43,288 --> 01:56:45,586
So, which story do you prefer?

941
01:56:53,089 --> 01:56:55,262
The one with the tiger.

942
01:56:56,259 --> 01:56:58,512
That's the better story.

943
01:57:01,848 --> 01:57:03,600
Thank you.

944
01:57:04,184 --> 01:57:06,607
And so it goes with God.

945
01:57:18,323 --> 01:57:20,166
Mamaji was right.

946
01:57:21,159 --> 01:57:23,457
It's an amazing story.

947
01:57:24,871 --> 01:57:26,794
Will you really
let me write it?

948
01:57:26,957 --> 01:57:28,379
Of course.

949
01:57:28,542 --> 01:57:31,796
Isn't that why Mamaji
sent you here, after all?

950
01:57:35,799 --> 01:57:37,392
My wife is here.

951
01:57:37,551 --> 01:57:39,792
Do you want to stay for dinner?
She's an incredible cook.

952
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:40,975
I didn't know you had a wife.

953
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:43,356
And a cat and two children.

954
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:46,352
So, your story does
have a happy ending.

955
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:49,484
Well, that's up to you.

956
01:57:49,813 --> 01:57:52,157
The story is yours now.

957
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:08,544
Hmm.

958
01:58:09,541 --> 01:58:13,762
"Mr. Patel's is an astounding
story of courage and endurance...

959
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,890
unparalleled in the
history of shipwrecks."

960
01:58:17,048 --> 01:58:21,349
"Very few castaways can claim to
have survived so long at sea...

961
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:24,060
and none in the company...

962
01:58:24,222 --> 01:58:26,896
of an adult Bengal tiger."

963
01:58:29,352 --> 01:58:30,649
Hi, Dad.

964
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:33,740
We have a guest.
Let me introduce you.

965
01:58:34,608 --> 01:58:35,734
Hi.
Hi.

966
01:58:36,026 --> 01:58:37,278
Nice to meet you.

967
01:58:37,444 --> 01:58:38,696
Adita.

968
01:58:39,696 --> 01:58:40,913
Ravi.
