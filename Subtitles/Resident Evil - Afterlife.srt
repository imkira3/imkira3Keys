<i>My name is Alice.</i>

3
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:06,539
<i>I worked for Umbrella Corporation
in a secret laboratory...</i>

4
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:09,459
<i>...developing experimental
viral weaponry.</i>

5
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,127
<i>There was an incident.</i>

6
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:12,587
<i>A virus escaped.</i>

7
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:14,756
<i>Everybody died.</i>

8
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:17,592
<i>Trouble was...</i>

9
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,928
<i>...they didn't stay dead.</i>

10
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:23,848
<i>This was the start of an apocalypse
that would sweep the entire world.</i>

11
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:27,352
<i>The men responsible for this disaster
took refuge underground...</i>

12
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:30,855
<i>...and continued to experiment
with the deadly T-Virus.</i>

13
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:34,359
<i>They felt secure
in their high-tech fortress.</i>

14
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:36,945
<i>But they were wrong.</i>

15
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:03,554
Biohazard terminated.

16
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,223
Central Shibuya.

17
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,059
Confirm?

18
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,812
I confirm.

19
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,149
Nice shooting.

20
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,694
And I lead three to one.

21
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,445
The night is young.

22
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:21,447
Plenty more fish in the--

23
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,660
Toshi, are you okay?

24
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:28,788
Toshi, where are you?

25
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,639
Sentry three respond.

26
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:33,519
We lost contact with another one.

27
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:37,106
- Chairman Wesker.
- Report.

28
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:40,526
Sir, a half-hour ago,
we began to lose contact...

29
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:42,862
...with some of our perimeter sentries.

30
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:45,907
- How many have we lost?
- All of them.

31
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,493
And you waited 30 minutes to tell me?

32
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:52,538
We thought it was a communications
problem. I didn't want to disturb you.

33
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:54,791
Give me the surface gate.

34
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,631
- This is Chairman Wesker.
- Sir.

35
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,049
Report your situation.

36
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:04,634
<i>Everything is quiet here.</i>

37
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:06,260
No sign of intruders?

38
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:11,390
- Hotaka.
- We have movement.

39
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,227
Multiple targets.

40
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,145
Surface gate, identify targets.

41
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:18,064
Repeat, identify targets.

42
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:20,441
Sir, Elevator 2 is moving.

43
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,485
I want security at that entrance.

44
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,353
Hey, boys.

45
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:06,232
Is that any way to treat a lady?

46
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:25,293
Tell security to flood
the main entrance with nerve gas

47
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:29,422
Sir, our men are still up there.

48
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,845
Any more questions?

49
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:41,017
Intruders in Sectors 1 through 5,
7 and 8.

50
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,311
Reports of gunfire
in Sectors 10 and 11.

51
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,649
Stay at your stations.

52
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,277
All security protocols
are now in full effect.

53
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,070
Lock down all elevators.

54
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:56,449
Seal all internal blast doors.

55
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,410
And I want damage reports.

56
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,082
Come on, move.

57
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,169
- Go, go. Everybody-
- Get out.

58
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,014
<i>Turbulence. Turbulence. Turbulence.</i>

59
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,062
<i>Turbulence. Turbulence.</i>

60
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,579
<i>Turbulence. Turb--</i>

61
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,763
Any last words?

62
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,154
How nice to finally meet the real you.

63
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,074
Hurts, doesn't it?

64
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:52,244
Well, that's just the start
of the bad news.

65
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,371
All those powers of yours:

66
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:58,459
Speed, strength, accelerated healing.

67
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:02,880
- Well, you can kiss all those goodbye.
- What have you done?

68
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:07,509
The serum I've injected you with is
neutralizing the T cells in your body.

69
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,637
Put simply...

70
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,682
...the Umbrella Corporation
is taking back its property.

71
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:17,311
You just didn't work out,
so you're being recalled.

72
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,870
I'm what you used to be.

73
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,164
Only better.

74
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,749
Please wait.

75
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,459
Last words?

76
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,087
Thank you.

77
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,922
For killing you?

78
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:47,883
For making me human again.

79
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:54,348
<i>Pu/I up. Terrain. Terrain.</i>

80
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,374
<i>This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.</i>

81
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,709
<i>There is no infection.</i>

82
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:06,545
<i>We offer safety and security,
food and shelter.</i>

83
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:12,342
<i>This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.</i>

84
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,595
<i>There is no infection.</i>

85
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,556
<i>While I took revenge on Umbrella...</i>

86
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:21,143
<i>...the last handful of survivors
took a chopper to safety.</i>

87
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,521
<i>They were headed for a town
in Alaska called Arcadia.</i>

88
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,024
<i>We'd received radio transmissions
from there.</i>

89
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,319
<i>They offered food and shelter,
safety and security.</i>

90
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:34,156
<i>A haven, free of infection.</i>

91
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,047
May 3rd, 1600 hours.

92
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:53,050
A hundred and seventy-seven days
without signs of life.

93
00:18:54,384 --> 00:19:01,391
I'm at 58.37 degrees north,
134.58 degrees west.

94
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:07,147
Closing in on the coordinates for
Arcadia, but no signs of it on any map.

95
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,235
I hope Claire and the others made it.

96
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,969
You're not coming?

97
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,637
Take care of the others.

98
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,056
Good luck, K-Mart.

99
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,601
Claire.

100
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,680
May 3rd.

101
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,682
1930 hours.

102
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,809
Arcadia.

103
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,687
No such place exists.

104
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:36,314
Just an empty field.

105
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:37,858
And a beach.

106
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,321
But we all heard the transmissions.

107
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,615
Someone must have sent them.

108
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:50,245
Someone must have brought
all these people here.

109
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:53,665
But Why?

110
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,793
And where did they go?

111
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:04,301
Day 177. Signing off.

112
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:10,974
I don't know
if I can do this much longer.

113
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,061
What if I'm the last one?

114
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,480
What if there is no one else?

115
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:20,233
No one to watch these tapes.

116
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,571
Is this my punishment...

117
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,782
...for letting all this happen?

118
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,829
Hey. Wait!

119
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,377
Wait, please! Stop!

120
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,092
Hello.

121
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,637
Hello?

122
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,474
Answer me.

123
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,249
Hey, he)'

124
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,460
It's okay.

125
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,339
Sorry about that.

126
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,800
But I had to get this thing off of you.

127
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,052
What is this?

128
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,553
Who did this to you?

129
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,935
Do you even know who I am?

130
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,358
My name is Alice.

131
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,111
We met in the Nevada desert
18 months ago.

132
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,072
Any of this sound familiar?

133
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,117
Mikey, Carlos, L.J.?

134
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,994
K-Mart?

135
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,872
You left in a helicopter...

136
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,917
...with a group of survivors
headed for Alaska.

137
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,836
Arcadia, remember?

138
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,971
<i>Arcadia, remember?</i>

139
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:40,058
<i>Arcadia, remember?</i>

140
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:06,209
May 4th, 0800 hours.

141
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:09,546
Plotting a course for Prince Rupert
in British Columbia.

142
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,882
I'll pass Vancouver,
drop down to Seattle.

143
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:18,638
After that, it's San Francisco
and the rest of the Western seaboard.

144
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,521
My passenger
is still as talkative as ever.

145
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,607
Whatever that thing was...

146
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:32,235
...it was injecting her
with some sort of drug.

147
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:35,238
Something that causes memory loss.

148
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:39,075
I just hope the effects
aren't permanent.

149
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,301
<i>Your name...</i>

150
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,512
<i>is Alice, right?</i>

151
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:01,848
<i>She speaks.</i>

152
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,310
Look, I'm sorry about back there.

153
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,980
I don't know what happened.

154
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,443
I don't remember anything.

155
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,697
I don't even know my name.

156
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:20,075
It's Claire.

157
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:23,995
Claire Redfield.

158
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,915
Claire?

159
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,708
Sound familiar?

160
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,295
Not really.

161
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,465
You'll get used to it.

162
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:40,595
Perhaps you can cut me loose now.

163
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,932
We should get to know each other
a little better first.

164
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,967
City of Angels.

165
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:28,643
May 6th, 1800 hours, Los Angeles.

166
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,062
No signs of life.

167
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:32,981
Not even the undead.

168
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,153
Some must have burnt with the city.

169
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,864
But what about the rest?

170
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,214
Oh, my God.

171
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,674
What?

172
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:01,509
Look over there.

173
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,937
Damn.

174
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,286
It's a plane.

175
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,538
It's a plane!

176
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,248
I knew it.

177
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,920
- I told you they would come.
- Hey, we're down here. Hello!

178
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:13,498
No way we're getting in there.

179
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,838
Where is he going?

180
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,257
Why is he flying away?

181
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:25,885
- It's not flying away. It's circling.
- Circling?

182
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:30,640
Damn, he's low.

183
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,101
Down!

184
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:36,938
What the hell is he doing?

185
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,319
He's gonna land.

186
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:46,155
He's gonna land.
Get the stuff out of the way.

187
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,783
- Land?
- Yeah.Land.

188
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,620
That is one crazy son of a bitch.

189
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,082
This may get a little rough.

190
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,334
Then cut me loose.

191
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:08,428
Thanks.

192
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,847
Just don't do anything crazy, all right?

193
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:15,018
Nothing as crazy
as what you have in mind.

194
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,903
- Come on, Kim, move it.
- I'm trying.

195
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,155
Well, try!

196
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,707
All right, hold on.

197
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:43,171
Hurry, he's coming.

198
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:48,760
Come on.

199
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:39,352
- Come on, pull it. Come on.
- Come on, pull!

200
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,023
Good. Good.

201
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,692
Good work.

202
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:47,860
That's it.

203
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,696
Good job.

204
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:01,249
- Nice landing.
- I think technically it's called crashing.

205
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:07,505
Luther West.

206
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:10,049
Alice. That's Claire.

207
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:14,637
Luther West. A pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

208
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:21,978
Hi, my name's Crystal.

209
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:26,149
No, no. Enough with the introductions.
So you're here to help us, right?

210
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,276
- Can you get us out?
- You from Arcadia?

211
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:30,570
- What did you say?
- Are you from Arcadia?

212
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:33,656
- What do you know about Arcadia?
- They said they'd help.

213
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,159
There are survivors.
Civilization and safety.

214
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,744
Infection free.

215
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:41,038
- So they sent you, right?
- No.

216
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:44,041
But there are others out there
like you?

217
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,502
It's just us.

218
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:48,379
There's to be no rescue?

219
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:50,590
I'm sorry.

220
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,972
- Sorry.
- Look, don't take it so bad.

221
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,891
They had their hopes up and...

222
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:02,602
Thought you could take them
to the promised land.

223
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,353
Angel Ortiz.

224
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:06,439
That was some fine flying.

225
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:08,107
Thanks.

226
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:19,118
- What's the prognosis?
- She'll live.

227
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,787
Yeah.

228
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,914
You know...

229
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,083
...I have the strangest feeling
I know you.

230
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:32,089
Yeah, I get that a lot.
You're a sports fan, huh?

231
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:34,884
Do you like basketball?

232
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:36,093
Not really.

233
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,804
No?

234
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:43,017
Well, maybe just a fan
of fine timepieces.

235
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:48,815
Yeah.

236
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:52,318
Luther here is our resident superstar.

237
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:55,029
So tell me about Arcadia.

238
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,697
What exactly do you know?

239
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,783
Just from their transmissions.

240
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,327
We've been receiving their broadcast
all week.

241
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:04,914
Food and shelter, safety and security,
no infection.

242
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,958
We thought they sent you.

243
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:10,253
We've been launching flares for days
to get their attention.

244
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,547
- Flares?
- Yeah.

245
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:16,092
Who's gonna see flares
from Alaska?

246
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,302
- Alaska?
- Alaska?

247
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:20,346
Arcadia. I've been there.

248
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:23,474
It's in Alaska.
It's a town, or so we thought.

249
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,268
A town?

250
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,686
I don't think so.

251
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:30,314
Take a look.

252
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:32,233
At what?

253
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,698
You see?

254
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:42,034
It's not a town.

255
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:45,538
It's a ship.

256
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:49,125
I recorded this from the shortwave.

257
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:51,627
<i>This is Arcadia,
on the emergency frequency.</i>

258
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:53,421
<i>There is no infection.</i>

259
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:56,048
<i>We offer safety and security,
food and shelter.</i>

260
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:57,508
It's the same message.

261
00:36:57,675 --> 00:37:00,511
They must have sailed the coast,
picking up survivors.

262
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:04,390
<i>This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.</i>

263
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:07,685
What is that?

264
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:09,353
I don't know.

265
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,898
That was the last we heard from them.

266
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,317
Then it just stopped.

267
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:17,278
That was two days ago.

268
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,947
We've been sending up flares
on the hour.

269
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:23,326
So when you arrived, of course,
we thought they sent you.

270
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,252
Claire.

271
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:36,047
That ship over there.

272
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,882
<i>That's Arcadia.</i>

273
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:39,342
I know.

274
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:42,303
- You remember?
- I remember the beach.

275
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:51,103
<i>People were coming to help us.</i>

276
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:54,315
What happened?
Why didn't you go with the others?

277
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:56,943
I don't know.

278
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,528
I can't remember.

279
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:05,743
<i>We have to get to that ship.</i>

280
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,663
<i>We have to get to that ship.</i>

281
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:33,330
Welcome to your new home,
cell block B.

282
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,380
Crystal's our cook.

283
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:45,509
The menu's not extensive,
but she is a master of what she does.

284
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:47,678
Sorry I didn't bring better news.

285
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:51,557
Get used to disappointment, right?
That's what my agent used to say.

286
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:53,267
Were you an actress?

287
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:56,437
I came to Hollywood,
ended up waiting tables.

288
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:59,482
Why are we waiting?
Excuse me. I'm hungry. Thank you.

289
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,734
- Get out of here, man.
- Thank you.

290
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:08,199
I met plenty of creeps like him
in my time.

291
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,534
What's his story?

292
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:13,746
Back in the world, he was some
kind of big movie producer.

293
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:15,915
The boy's got a stick up his ass.

294
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:23,255
Kim Yong used to intern for him. Still
hasn't figured the world has changed.

295
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:38,729
That plane,
do you think it could still fly?

296
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:44,568
- It can fly, but it only seats two.
- So take us to Arcadia one at a time.

297
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:47,613
Look, I think she was lucky
to land here once.

298
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,699
Five or six times would be suicide.

299
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,451
No offense.

300
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:55,538
None taken.

301
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,962
There has to be another way out.
We have to get to that ship.

302
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:06,298
Well, there is the--

303
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:09,969
What?

304
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:11,762
Nothing.

305
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,641
Look, it would be a waste of your time.

306
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:19,395
I have time to waste.

307
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,985
When the shit hit the fan,
we took refuge in the prison.

308
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:29,655
It seemed like it had the biggest,
strongest walls.

309
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:32,575
The best chance
of keeping those things out.

310
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:37,621
By the time we got here, the guards
and inmates were already long gone.

311
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:42,001
I guess when people started eating
one another...

312
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:45,379
...there wasn't much point
in keeping anybody locked up.

313
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,507
We thought the place
was abandoned...

314
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:51,010
...until we made a discovery.

315
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:57,558
Wendell...

316
00:41:57,808 --> 00:41:59,518
...time to take a break.

317
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:02,563
It's about goddamn time.
I hate being down here.

318
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:06,150
I'm hearing movement in the walls.

319
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:08,444
So let's check it out.

320
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:11,488
I'll be back in a minute.

321
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:15,201
Come on.

322
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:54,406
Name's Chris.

323
00:42:57,493 --> 00:43:00,412
You were the one flying that plane.

324
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:03,666
How do you know that?

325
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:07,378
Wendell isn't the only one
that hears things.

326
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:10,172
I'm glad you made it.

327
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:13,425
Maybe you can talk some sense
into these people.

328
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:16,387
What do you mean?

329
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:20,266
Isn't it obvious?

330
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:22,434
I'm not a prisoner.

331
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:25,938
I shouldn't be in here.

332
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:32,361
I was working with a military unit.

333
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:35,739
We were using this place
as a staging post.

334
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,743
Things were already bad
when the order came through...

335
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,954
...to release all the inmates.

336
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:45,207
We needed as many people
on the streets as possible...

337
00:43:45,374 --> 00:43:47,334
...to fight those things.

338
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,129
And it was chaos.

339
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:54,216
We were pulling out and a gang
of the prisoners jumped me.

340
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:56,844
I guess they thought I was a guard.

341
00:43:57,011 --> 00:44:00,556
I woke up, my unit was gone.

342
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:03,017
I was in here.

343
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:05,519
Their idea of a joke.

344
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:08,772
You don't believe me.

345
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:13,485
Do the others?

346
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:16,447
You need to get me out of here.

347
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:18,866
- We're all trapped here.
- That's true.

348
00:44:19,408 --> 00:44:21,618
But I can help you.

349
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:23,620
Seen enough?

350
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:25,622
- You find anything?
- No.

351
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:28,459
I know a way out of this place.

352
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:37,343
If you get me out of here,
I'll do the same for you.

353
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:40,512
You're gonna need me!

354
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:43,432
Have you checked
what he's talking about?

355
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,267
His way out?

356
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:49,313
He's not telling us shit till we
let him out. And I'm not letting him out.

357
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,564
The man is a killer.

358
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:52,524
- Really?
- I can see it in his eyes.

359
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:54,068
How can you be so sure?

360
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:55,652
I know people.

361
00:44:55,819 --> 00:44:58,405
Interesting. So tell me.

362
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:01,575
What do you see
when you look into my eyes?

363
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:12,336
Holy shit.

364
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:15,255
Girl's gotta be prepared.

365
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,386
What would you possibly want
with those?

366
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:21,887
It's a hobby.

367
00:45:22,513 --> 00:45:24,264
A hobby?

368
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:26,308
All right.

369
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,519
Well, I'll see you in the morning.

370
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:41,198
No sign of anyone on deck.

371
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:45,411
Your friends are out there?

372
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:49,123
I think so.

373
00:45:49,706 --> 00:45:51,667
You don't remember?

374
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,044
It's coming back.

375
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:56,088
Slowly.

376
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:01,927
Nothing that makes any sense.

377
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:47,282
We still have running water.

378
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:49,076
That's very civilized.

379
00:47:49,243 --> 00:47:50,536
We do our best.

380
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,332
It's cold.

381
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:57,793
Our best only goes so far.

382
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:00,254
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

383
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,716
I guess I should leave you to it.

384
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,009
I guess you should.

385
00:48:06,343 --> 00:48:07,511
I'll be right outside.

386
00:48:07,678 --> 00:48:09,304
Thank you.

387
00:48:23,277 --> 00:48:24,278
Luther?

388
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:29,157
Luther?

389
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:23,295
- Take it easy, honey.
- Move it.

390
00:49:23,629 --> 00:49:26,590
Okay,
I'm just gonna be on my way now.

391
00:49:26,757 --> 00:49:29,343
Okay, take it easy. Take it easy.

392
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:30,969
Get out of my sight.

393
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:03,585
What is that smell?

394
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:05,712
Must have burrowed up
from the sewers.

395
00:50:06,088 --> 00:50:08,340
Wendell said he heard things moving.

396
00:50:08,507 --> 00:50:11,176
What? So these things can
just burst out anywhere?

397
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:13,428
We gotta get out of this place.

398
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:15,263
Arcadia will send help.

399
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,808
No one's coming to get us.
Okay? No one.

400
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:20,352
We have to help ourselves.

401
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:23,188
- This plane that you have.
- Won't hold everybody.

402
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:24,981
- Well, we can draw straws.
- No.

403
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:28,068
We all get out of here
and no one gets left behind.

404
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:29,444
Great.

405
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:31,279
How are we gonna do that?

406
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:33,824
Walk out of here, just single file?

407
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,701
Are you crazy?

408
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:39,538
- They didn't want him getting out.
- He's dangerous.

409
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:42,541
Angel, what do you think?

410
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,502
I think we don't have much of a choice.

411
00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:47,170
This is insane.

412
00:50:47,337 --> 00:50:49,840
Crystal, Crystal, look at me.
What do you think?

413
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:55,429
- I mean, not even you're that dumb.
- I guess I am. I agree with Angel.

414
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:58,932
If this guy thinks he knows a way out,
I wanna hear it.

415
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:00,642
All right.

416
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:02,602
Seriously?

417
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:06,189
This is a mistake.

418
00:51:06,356 --> 00:51:09,484
This is a big mistake.
You better keep your eyes on him.

419
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:24,958
I was wondering how long
it would take.

420
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:41,808
<i>_I__
- All right, let's get the hell out of here.</i>

421
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:47,564
- Claire?
- What?

422
00:51:50,901 --> 00:51:52,152
Claire, it's me.

423
00:51:57,324 --> 00:51:59,409
It's Chris.

424
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:03,914
I don't know you.

425
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,582
Claire.

426
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:07,334
I'm your brother, remember?

427
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:11,588
What the hell's happened to you?

428
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:14,174
It's okay.

429
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:15,592
Let him go.

430
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:22,724
Look, she suffered
some sort of memory loss.

431
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:24,935
If you really are her brother...

432
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:27,145
...it'll come back.

433
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:30,440
All right, this is touching.
Family reunion.

434
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:36,112
If we could just get a move on, please,
before we're all eaten the fuck alive.

435
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:50,085
Behind those doors is a UPV,
urban pacification vehicle.

436
00:52:50,252 --> 00:52:52,837
The prison kept it
in case of a serious riot.

437
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:57,467
Sixteen-wheeler, steel plate,
water cannon. It seats 20.

438
00:52:57,634 --> 00:52:59,594
Ten tons of fun.

439
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:02,764
We roll on out in style,
drive right over them.

440
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:06,101
The lock's jammed.
But we can cut through it.

441
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:09,312
When we hit the coast,
we have to transfer to a boat.

442
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:12,315
- We're gonna need more firepower.
- I got you covered.

443
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:16,152
When I was stationed here,
we used the basement as an armory.

444
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,530
It's got every weapon
you can dream of.

445
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:21,950
How do you know your unit
didn't take them with them?

446
00:53:22,117 --> 00:53:23,743
Because by the end...

447
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:27,122
...there were more guns
than there were people to use them.

448
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:33,336
You go get the guns. Luther.

449
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:38,717
Oh, my God.

450
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:47,058
What is this?

451
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:50,145
They had pumps to keep the water
out of the foundations.

452
00:53:50,312 --> 00:53:54,691
When the electricity failed, some of
the lower levels started filling up.

453
00:53:54,858 --> 00:53:57,277
There's another two floors down there.

454
00:53:57,444 --> 00:53:59,613
And how far down is the armory?

455
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,823
All the way.

456
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:05,910
Luther, come on.

457
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:09,247
Get back. Get back.

458
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:16,755
Where do you think you're going?

459
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:19,132
I was a swim champ
back in high school.

460
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,719
- Is that right?
- Here.

461
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,893
You're gonna trust me with a gun?

462
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:32,937
Yeah. Why not?

463
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:37,525
Luther, just shoot that motherfucker.

464
00:54:44,074 --> 00:54:46,076
What the fuck is that thing?

465
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:13,765
All right. Let's go.

466
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,536
Let's go.

467
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:01,855
Nice.

468
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:18,162
Damn.

469
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,725
There must be hundreds of them
out there.

470
00:58:39,309 --> 00:58:41,603
We can't go back that way.

471
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:49,235
- Oh, shit.
- What do you mean, "oh, shit"?

472
00:58:49,402 --> 00:58:51,487
What--? What is this?

473
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,197
What do you think it is?

474
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:55,783
Don't tell me
that thing fits inside of there.

475
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,827
Can you put this back together?

476
00:58:57,994 --> 00:59:00,121
Maybe, but it could take a week.

477
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:02,332
What do we do now?

478
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:04,584
I know.

479
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:11,883
Bennefi...

480
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:15,261
...what have you done?

481
00:59:21,768 --> 00:59:24,312
Luther, we gotta get out of here.
Come on.

482
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,300
Did you hear that?

483
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,348
Come on, baby. Come on.

484
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:02,225
- What are we doing?
- Getting out.

485
01:00:02,392 --> 01:00:04,268
- But the others.
- Fuck the others.

486
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:06,020
Now, get on board.

487
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:08,231
Bennett, what are you doing?

488
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:11,192
- Hey!
- Kim Yong! Don't do this.

489
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,610
Open this door.

490
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:16,155
Bennett, please.

491
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,912
Bennefi!

492
01:00:29,544 --> 01:00:30,920
Oh, shit!

493
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:35,216
That's right, bitch. Fuck you.

494
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:42,724
Yes! Yes!

495
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,350
Son of a bitch.

496
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:46,686
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

497
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:49,564
He's headed for the Arcadia.

498
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:02,994
Alice.

499
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:25,683
Come on!

500
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:42,325
Head for the shower block.

501
01:01:44,911 --> 01:01:46,996
- Move.
- I'll meet you there.

502
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:51,501
This thing has no power.

503
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:54,128
We won't need power.

504
01:01:58,466 --> 01:01:59,884
Oh, shit.

505
01:02:13,356 --> 01:02:15,191
Hold on!

506
01:02:23,866 --> 01:02:25,868
Hey, head to the shower block. Go.

507
01:03:26,762 --> 01:03:28,639
Over here!

508
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:21,442
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

509
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:27,156
This is some kind of joke, right?

510
01:04:27,323 --> 01:04:30,910
The tunnels lead to the sewers,
the sewers lead to the storm drain.

511
01:04:31,077 --> 01:04:33,371
This storm drain leads to the sea.

512
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:36,374
- It's our only chance.
- I'll take point.

513
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,625
I got your back.

514
01:04:41,379 --> 01:04:42,630
Ladies.

515
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,679
All right, you're next.

516
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:53,557
- I can't do it.
- You can.

517
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:55,935
Let's go!

518
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:07,102
Those things are close.

519
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:13,651
We found a way out just down there.
The tunnels drop into a storm drain.

520
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:16,153
Go. Be careful.

521
01:09:24,078 --> 01:09:25,287
Where's Kim Yong?

522
01:09:28,332 --> 01:09:30,417
Go. Go.

523
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:47,518
I knew you'd make it.

524
01:09:56,944 --> 01:09:58,737
Luther!

525
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:00,698
Help!

526
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:07,079
Luther!

527
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:13,460
You can't help him now.

528
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:17,298
We have to move on.

529
01:11:47,388 --> 01:11:49,682
No welcome party, huh?

530
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,911
It looks like Bennett made it.

531
01:12:13,038 --> 01:12:15,124
Let's check inside.

532
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:35,811
- Did you find anyone?
- Nothing.

533
01:12:35,978 --> 01:12:39,398
I checked the crew quarters.
They're all gone.

534
01:12:39,565 --> 01:12:41,984
Looks like they left in a hurry.

535
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:46,739
<i>This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.</i>

536
01:12:46,905 --> 01:12:51,034
<i>There is no infection. We offer safety
and security, food and shelter.</i>

537
01:12:52,745 --> 01:12:55,497
Fuel, power,
everything's running normally.

538
01:12:55,664 --> 01:12:56,749
Look at this.

539
01:12:56,915 --> 01:12:58,709
It's the ship's log.

540
01:12:58,876 --> 01:13:01,378
The crew launched the lifeboats
three days ago.

541
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:04,423
Exactly when
the transmissions stopped.

542
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:07,384
But it says
there are still 2000 survivors on board.

543
01:13:15,142 --> 01:13:18,270
We have to search every inch
of this ship.

544
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:36,288
Umbrella.

545
01:13:36,455 --> 01:13:38,207
Of course.

546
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,084
I remember them coming for us.

547
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:03,607
This whole thing, Arcadia, was a lie.

548
01:14:03,941 --> 01:14:05,984
No, it's worse than that.

549
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:07,903
It's a trap.

550
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:45,357
Where is everybody?

551
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:50,529
I don't understand.

552
01:14:58,787 --> 01:15:00,539
I think I do.

553
01:15:01,874 --> 01:15:03,625
They're underneath our feet.

554
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:13,510
They're holding survivors
to experiment on them.

555
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,055
Look.

556
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:20,142
It's K-Mart. She's here.

557
01:15:20,309 --> 01:15:21,393
Bring them up.

558
01:15:22,644 --> 01:15:24,354
All of them.

559
01:15:43,624 --> 01:15:45,500
Here she is.

560
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:46,710
K-Mart.

561
01:15:46,877 --> 01:15:47,920
Get her out.

562
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,636
K-Mart, it's okay. It's okay.

563
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:59,681
- K-Mart, it's all right.
- I'll get this off her. Let everyone out.

564
01:16:00,307 --> 01:16:03,101
We're your friends.
Right now, we need your help.

565
01:16:03,435 --> 01:16:05,395
Let me get this off you.

566
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:49,226
Why am I not surprised?

567
01:18:49,476 --> 01:18:51,645
You weren't too hard to find.

568
01:18:51,812 --> 01:18:54,731
Our satellite system is still operational.

569
01:18:54,898 --> 01:18:58,110
And there aren't too many people
flying nowadays.

570
01:18:58,276 --> 01:19:03,115
And besides, I always knew
you'd be drawn to your friends.

571
01:19:04,324 --> 01:19:05,367
L_Qyal'Â£y...

572
01:19:05,992 --> 01:19:07,994
...highly overrated.

573
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:13,250
Stop.

574
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:16,336
Down.

575
01:19:17,629 --> 01:19:20,632
Wouldn't want you harming my pets.

576
01:19:23,218 --> 01:19:24,594
Drop your guns.

577
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:33,478
Thank you. Kick them to me.

578
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:37,816
Good.

579
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,946
You don't look so good, Bennett.

580
01:19:43,113 --> 01:19:46,324
Yeah, I'm looking forward to playing
with your pretty face.

581
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:48,243
What do you want from me?

582
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:51,663
The T-Virus brought me back.

583
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:58,753
But it's so strong.

584
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,090
It fights me for control.

585
01:20:02,883 --> 01:20:05,969
I thought if I ingested
fresh human DNA...

586
01:20:06,136 --> 01:20:08,138
...I could redress the balance.

587
01:20:08,722 --> 01:20:11,474
No wonder your crew abandoned ship.

588
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:12,976
No matter.

589
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:15,270
Now I have a new subordinate.

590
01:20:16,104 --> 01:20:17,939
And a new plan.

591
01:20:18,106 --> 01:20:22,194
You were the only one who
successfully bonded with the T-Virus.

592
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:25,488
Your DNA is stronger than the others.

593
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:27,824
I ingest you...

594
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:30,160
...I gain control.

595
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:34,873
That's pretty smart thinking.

596
01:20:35,332 --> 01:20:38,001
There's only one problem
with that plan.

597
01:20:38,168 --> 01:20:40,337
Stop right there.

598
01:20:40,962 --> 01:20:42,672
And what is that?

599
01:20:43,006 --> 01:20:45,258
I'm not on the menu.

600
01:21:24,339 --> 01:21:28,218
Well, isn't this one big family reunion?

601
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:31,471
Chris and Claire Redfield.

602
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:35,809
You've really become quite
an inconvenience for me.

603
01:21:37,102 --> 01:21:39,938
I told you I'd be bringing a few friends.

604
01:21:44,317 --> 01:21:47,112
You should have brought more.

605
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:05,148
Claire. Claire!

606
01:23:11,404 --> 01:23:12,447
Chris!

607
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:16,284
Chris!

608
01:23:58,201 --> 01:24:01,413
Don't even think about it.

609
01:24:08,753 --> 01:24:10,422
Who the fuck are you?

610
01:25:01,848 --> 01:25:02,974
I don't think so.

611
01:25:25,205 --> 01:25:27,957
Don't-- Don't you shut them.
I'm a producer!

612
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:32,295
Open those doors.

613
01:25:32,462 --> 01:25:35,173
You are gonna deal
with some serious consequences.

614
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,133
You motherfuckers.

615
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,302
Open the--

616
01:25:43,056 --> 01:25:45,558
You're gonna live to regret this,
all of you!

617
01:25:53,316 --> 01:25:55,109
Oh, God.

618
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:58,238
I just wanna go home.

619
01:26:06,704 --> 01:26:07,872
Hey...

620
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:09,958
...it's gonna be okay.

621
01:26:12,335 --> 01:26:13,545
No.

622
01:26:13,711 --> 01:26:15,338
Chris! Alice!

623
01:26:35,108 --> 01:26:36,609
Come on!

624
01:27:19,986 --> 01:27:22,196
I didn't want you to miss that.

625
01:27:41,716 --> 01:27:43,551
That's right.

626
01:27:44,636 --> 01:27:46,929
Star power, bitches.

627
01:27:57,982 --> 01:27:59,942
It's a miracle.

628
01:28:01,653 --> 01:28:05,323
I never dreamed there would be
this many of us left alive.

629
01:28:08,493 --> 01:28:10,536
So, what's next?

630
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:19,087
<i>This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequen--</i>

631
01:28:20,713 --> 01:28:22,548
I say...

632
01:28:23,341 --> 01:28:25,301
...we live up to the promise.

633
01:28:26,302 --> 01:28:30,348
This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.

634
01:28:30,515 --> 01:28:35,978
Location 118.30 degrees west,
34.05 degrees north.

635
01:28:36,145 --> 01:28:37,730
<i>There is no infection.</i>

636
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:40,775
<i>Repeat, there is no infection.</i>

637
01:28:40,942 --> 01:28:45,530
We offer safety and security,
food and shelter.

638
01:28:45,697 --> 01:28:49,325
If you are out there, we will help you.

639
01:28:49,575 --> 01:28:51,536
There is hope.

640
01:29:16,227 --> 01:29:18,938
- What is that?
- Trouble.

641
01:30:32,887 --> 01:30:35,515
Deployment in T-minus 57 seconds.

642
01:30:35,681 --> 01:30:38,476
When you hit the deck,
you watch your formation.

643
01:30:38,643 --> 01:30:40,770
Take no prisoners and shoot to kill.

644
01:30:40,937 --> 01:30:43,022
Total enemy numbers are unknown...

645
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:46,526
...but will include Umbrella fugitives
and prime targets.

646
01:30:46,692 --> 01:30:50,905
Claire Redfield, Chris Redfield
and Project Alice.

647
01:30:51,322 --> 01:30:53,157
So, people...

648
01:30:53,324 --> 01:30:58,120
...whatever's waiting for you out there,
just know one thing:

649
01:30:58,704 --> 01:31:02,542
You are gonna be in for the fight...

650
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:05,002
...of your lives.

651
01:36:44,842 --> 01:36:46,135
