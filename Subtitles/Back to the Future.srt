October is
inventory time,

3
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,969
so right now,
Statler Toyota

4
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,929
is making the best
deals of the year

5
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,182
on all
1985-model Toyotas.

6
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,808
You won't find a better car

7
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:44,187
at a better price with better
service anywhere in Hill Valley.

8
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,565
That's Statler Toyota
in downtown Hill Valley.

9
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,529
The Senate is expected
to vote on this today.

10
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:57,784
In other news, officials at the
Pacific Nuclear research facility

11
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,536
have denied the rumor that
a case of missing plutonium

12
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,873
was in fact stolen from
their vault two weeks ago.

13
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,417
A Libyan terrorist group
had claimed responsibility

14
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:07,710
for the alleged theft.

15
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,879
However,
officials now attribute

16
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,381
the discrepancy to
a simple clerical error.

17
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,636
The FBI, which is investigating
the matter, had no comment.

18
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,720
Hey, Doc?

19
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,432
Doc?

20
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,352
Hello! Anybody home?

21
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,687
Einstein, come here, boy.

22
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,357
What's going on? Oh, God.

23
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,151
Oh, Jesus!

24
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,030
That is disgusting.
Where the hell is he?

25
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,278
Whoa!

26
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,658
Rock 'n' roll.

27
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,417
Yo.
Marty, is that you?

28
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,544
Hey. Hey, Doc.
Where are you?

29
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,796
Thank God
I've found you.

30
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,298
Listen, can you meet me at
Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15?

31
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,133
I made a major breakthrough,
and I'll need your assistance.

32
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,426
Wait a minute.
1:15 in the morning?

33
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,511
Yeah.

34
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,262
Doc, what's going on?

35
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,306
Where you been all week?
Working.

36
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,766
Where's Einstein?
Is he with you?

37
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,559
Yeah, he's right here.

38
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,270
You know, Doc, you left
your equipment on all week.

39
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,940
My equipment.
That reminds me, Marty.

40
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,483
You better not hook up
to the amplifier.

41
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,860
There's a slight
possibility of overload.

42
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,321
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

43
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,824
Good. I'll see you tonight.
Don't forget now.

44
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,701
1:15 a. m.,
Twin Pines Mall.

45
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,827
Right.

46
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,335
Are those my clocks
I hear?

47
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,088
Yeah, it's 8:00.

48
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,674
Perfect!
My experiment worked!

49
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,260
They're all exactly
25 minutes slow!

50
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,263
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Doc.

51
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,016
Are you telling
me that it's 8:25?

52
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,225
Precisely.

53
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,687
Damn!
I'm late for school.

54
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,499
Jennifer. Marty, don't go this way.

55
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,583
Strickland's
looking for you.

56
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,002
If you get caught, it'll
be four tardies in a row.

57
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,298
All right, come on.
I think we're safe.

58
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,509
You know, this time
it wasn't my fault.

59
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,928
The doc set all his
clocks 25 minutes slow.

60
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,262
Doc?

61
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,724
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?

62
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,311
Tardy slip for you,
Miss Parker.

63
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,690
And one for you, McFly. I
believe that makes four in a row.

64
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,735
Let me give you a nickel's
worth of free advice, young man.

65
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,988
This so-called Dr. Brown is
dangerous. He's a real nutcase.

66
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,491
You hang around with him, you're
gonna end up in big trouble.

67
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,867
Ooh. Yes, sir.

68
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,163
You got a real attitude
problem, McFly. You're a slacker.

69
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,082
You remind me of your
father when he went here.

70
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,543
He was a slacker, too.

71
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,711
Can I go now,
Mr. Strickland?

72
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,463
I noticed your band
is on the roster

73
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,549
for the dance auditions
after school today.

74
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,051
Why even bother, McFly?
You don't have a chance.

75
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,928
You're too much
like your old man.

76
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,264
No McFly ever amounted
to anything

77
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,057
in the history
of Hill Valley.

78
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,186
Yeah, well,
history is gonna change.

79
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,773
Next, please.

80
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,738
Okay, guys,
let's rock 'n roll.

81
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,367
All right.

82
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,912
We're the...
We're the Pinheads.

83
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,040
One, two, three.

84
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,730
Okay, that's enough.
Thank you, fellas.

85
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,940
Hold it, fellas.

86
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,693
I'm afraid you're
just too darn loud.

87
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,987
Next, please.

88
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,491
Bring up
the next group, please.

89
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,371
Re-elect Mayor
"Goldie" Wilson.

90
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,457
Progress is
his middle name.

91
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,626
"Too loud. "
I can't believe it.

92
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,337
I'm never gonna get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

93
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,797
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

94
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,300
I just don't think
I'm cut out for music.

95
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,344
But you're good, Marty.
You're really good,

96
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,221
and this audition
tape of yours is great.

97
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,348
You've gotta send it in
to the record company.

98
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,225
It's like Doc's always
saying. Yeah, I know. I know.

99
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,351
"If you put
your mind to it,

100
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,937
"you can
accomplish anything. "

101
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,022
That's good advice, Marty.

102
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,565
All right,
okay, Jennifer.

103
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,609
What if I send in the tape
and they don't like it?

104
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,611
What if they say
I'm no good?

105
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,988
What if they say, "Get out of
here, kid. You got no future"?

106
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,283
I mean, I just don't think I
can take that kind of rejection.

107
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,369
Jesus, I'm starting to
sound like my old man.

108
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,204
Come on. He's not that
bad. Save the clock tower.

109
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,832
At least he's letting you
borrow the car tomorrow night.

110
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,418
Check out that 4x4.

111
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,420
That is hot.

112
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,755
Okay. Back her up.

113
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,092
Someday, Jennifer.
Someday.

114
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,054
Wouldn't it be great to take
that truck up to the lake?

115
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,058
Throw a couple of
sleeping bags in the back.

116
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,353
Lie out
underneath the stars.

117
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,272
Stop it.
What?

118
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,733
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?

119
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,026
No, get out of town.

120
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,862
My mom thinks I'm going
camping with the guys.

121
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,531
Jennifer, my mother
would freak out

122
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,949
if she knew I was going
up there with you,

123
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,201
and I'd get the
standard lecture about

124
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,662
how she never did that kind
of stuff when she was a kid.

125
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,623
I mean, look, I think
the woman was born a nun.

126
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,209
She's just trying to
keep you respectable.

127
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,461
Well, she's not doing
a very good job.

128
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,754
Terrible.

129
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,508
Save the clock tower.
Save the clock tower.

130
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,637
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an
initiative to replace that clock.

131
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,307
Thirty years ago, lightning
struck that clock tower

132
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,142
and the clock
hasn't run since.

133
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,519
We at the Hill Valley
Preservation Society

134
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,022
think it should be preserved
exactly the way it is

135
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,857
as part of our history
and heritage.

136
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:50,983
There you go, lady.
There's a quarter.

137
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,109
Thank you.

138
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,235
Don't forget
to take a flyer.

139
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Right.

140
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,322
Save the clock tower!

141
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,575
Where were we?

142
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,160
Right about here.

143
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,328
Jennifer!

144
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,791
It's my dad. I've got to go. Right.

145
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,335
I'll call you tonight.

146
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,544
I'll be at my grandma's.

147
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,047
Here, let me
give you the number.

148
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,094
Bye.

149
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,307
Bravo, Tango, Delta 6-2-9.

150
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,477
Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.

151
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,482
Perfect.
Just perfect.

152
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,116
I can't believe you'd
loan me your car

153
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,034
without telling me
it had a blind spot.

154
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,702
Blind spot? I could've been killed.

155
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,414
Now, Biff, now,
I never noticed

156
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:32,501
that the car had any blind spot
before when I would drive it.

157
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,002
Hi, Son.

158
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,296
What, are you blind,
McFly? It's there.

159
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,257
How else do you explain
that wreck out there?

160
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,343
Biff, can I assume

161
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,805
that your insurance is
going to pay for the damage?

162
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,182
My insurance?
It's your car.

163
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,475
Your insurance
should pay for it.

164
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,102
I wanna know who's
going to pay for this?

165
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,062
I spilled beer all over it
when the car smashed into me.

166
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,230
Who's gonna pay
my cleaning bill?

167
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,314
Ah...

168
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,358
And where's
my reports?

169
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,943
Well, I haven't
finished those up yet,

170
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,696
but I figured since
they weren't due till...

171
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,699
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home? Huh?

172
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,702
Think, McFly. Think!
All right.

173
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,871
I got to have time
to get them retyped.

174
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,205
Do you realize
what would happen

175
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,083
if I hand in my reports
in your handwriting?

176
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,710
I'll get fired.

177
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,588
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

178
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,590
Would you?
Of course not, Biff.

179
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,134
Now, I wouldn't
want that to happen.

180
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,053
Now, look. I'll finish
those reports on up tonight,

181
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,973
and I'll run them on over
first thing tomorrow, all right?

182
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,892
Not too early.
I sleep in Saturday.

183
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,226
McFly, your shoe's untied.

184
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,311
Oh.

185
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,771
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

186
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,732
Got the place fixed
up nice, though, McFly.

187
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,069
I have your car towed
all the way to your house

188
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,821
and all you got for me
is lite beer?

189
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,248
What are you
looking at, butthead?

190
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,294
Say hi to your mom
for me.

191
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,090
I know what you're
going to say, Son,

192
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,801
and you're right.
You're right.

193
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,890
But Biff just happens
to be my supervisor,

194
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,603
And I'm afraid I'm just not
very good at confrontations.

195
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,481
But the car, Dad.

196
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,944
I mean, he wrecked it.
He totaled it.

197
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,947
I needed that car
tomorrow night, Dad.

198
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,199
Do you have any idea how
important this was to me?

199
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,325
Do you have any clue?

200
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,078
I know, and all I can
say is, I'm...

201
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,749
Believe me, Marty,
you're better off

203
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,752
without having to worry
about all the aggravation

204
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,089
and headaches of
playing at that dance.

205
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,840
He's
absolutely right, Marty.

206
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,426
The last thing you
need is headaches.

207
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,896
Kids, we're going to have to
eat this cake by ourselves.

208
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,857
Your Uncle Joey didn't
make parole again.

209
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,572
I think it would be nice if
you all dropped him a line.

210
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,407
Uncle
"Jailbird" Joey?

211
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,950
He's your brother, Mom.

212
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,870
Yeah. I think it's a major
embarrassment, having an uncle in prison.

213
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,164
We all make mistakes
in life, children.

214
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,958
God damn it.
I'm late.

215
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,710
David,
watch your mouth!

216
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,379
You come here and kiss your
mother before you go. Come here.

217
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,549
Come on, Mom. Make it
fast. I'll miss my bus.

218
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,509
See you later, Pop.

219
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,345
Time to
change that oil.

220
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:37,019
Hey, Marty. I'm not
your answering service.

221
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,521
While you were outside
pouting over the car,

222
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,857
Jennifer Parker
called you twice.

223
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,358
I don't like her, Marty.

224
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,570
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

225
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,531
Oh, Mother, there's nothing
wrong with calling a boy.

226
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:53,118
I think it's terrible.
Girls chasing boys.

227
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,872
When I was your age, I never
chased a boy or called a boy

228
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,499
or sat in a parked car
with a boy.

229
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,045
Then how am I supposed
to ever meet anybody?

230
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,173
Well, it'll just happen.

231
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,758
Like the way
I met your father.

232
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,553
That was so stupid. Grandpa
hit him with the car.

233
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,805
It was meant to be.

234
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,185
Anyway, if Grandpa
hadn't hit him,

235
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,936
then none of you
would have been born.

236
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,313
Yeah, well.

237
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,649
I still don't understand
what Dad was doing

238
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,150
in the middle
of the street.

239
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,694
What was it, George?
Bird-watching?

240
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,905
What, Lorraine? What?

241
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,325
Anyway, your Grandpa
hit him with the car

242
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,118
and brought him
into the house.

243
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,413
He seemed so helpless,

244
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,169
like a little lost puppy, and
my heart just went out to him.

245
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,422
Yeah, Mom, we know. You've told
us this story a million times.

246
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,840
You felt sorry for him,

247
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,384
so you decided
to go with him

248
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,010
to the Fish Under
the Sea dance.

249
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,263
No. It was the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

250
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,226
Our first date.
I'll never forget it.

251
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,354
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember, George?

252
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,945
Your father kissed me for the very
first time on that dance floor.

253
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,032
It was then
that I realized

254
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,993
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

255
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,065
Hello.

256
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,608
Marty, you didn't
fall asleep, did you?

257
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,152
Doc.

258
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,613
No. No, don't be silly.

259
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,950
Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.

260
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,870
Can you stop by my place and pick
it up on your way to the mall?

261
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,706
Yeah. I'm on my way.

262
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:29,107
Einstein! Hey, Einstein,
where's the doc, boy? Huh?

263
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,372
Doc!

264
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,999
Marty! You made it!

265
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,125
Yeah.

266
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,294
Welcome to my latest
experiment. This is the big one,

267
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,255
the one I've been
waiting for all my life.

268
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,798
Well, it's a DeLorean...

269
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,716
Bear with me, Marty. All your
questions will be answered.

270
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,134
Roll tape
and we'll proceed.

271
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,261
Doc,

272
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,345
is that a DEVO suit?

273
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,721
Never mind that now.

274
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:42,889
Not now.

275
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,015
All right. I'm ready.

276
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,351
Good evening.
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

277
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,603
I'm standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.

278
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,274
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a. m.,

279
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,609
and this is temporal
experiment number one.

280
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,736
Come on, Einie. Hey,
hey, boy, get in there.

281
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,114
That a boy!
In you go. Sit down.

282
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,575
Put your seat belt on.
That's it.

283
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,747
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

284
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,207
Okay.

285
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,169
Please note that
Einstein's clock

286
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,172
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

287
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,841
Got it?
Right. Check, Doc.

288
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,925
Good.

289
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,055
Have a good trip, Einstein.
Watch your head.

290
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,062
You got that thing
hooked up to the car?

291
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,315
Watch this.

292
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,692
Yeah. Okay. Got it.

293
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:40,989
Jesus!

294
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,537
Not me!
The car! The car!

295
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,182
If my calculations
are correct,

296
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,352
when this baby
hits 88 miles per hour

297
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,854
you're going to see
some serious shit.

298
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,558
Watch this.
Watch this.

299
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,996
What did I tell you?

300
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,541
88 miles per hour!

301
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,129
The temporal
displacement occurred

302
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,549
exactly 1:20 a. m.
And zero seconds!

303
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,177
Jesus Christ!

304
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,680
Jesus Christ, Doc!
You disintegrated Einstein!

305
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,391
Calm down, Marty. I didn't
disintegrate anything.

306
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:36,187
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

307
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,647
Then where the hell
are they?

308
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,232
The appropriate
question is,

309
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,859
"When the hell
are they?"

310
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:45,405
You see, Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

311
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,825
I sent him
into the future.

312
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,953
One minute into the future, to be exact.

313
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,248
At precisely 1:21 a. m.
And zero seconds,

314
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,209
we shall catch up with him
and the time machine.

315
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,757
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Doc.

316
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,303
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine

317
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,638
out of a DeLorean?

318
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,765
The way I see it,

319
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,725
if you're going to build
a time machine into a car,

320
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,643
why not do it
with some style?

321
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,897
Besides, the stainless-steel
construction made the flux dispersal...

322
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,941
Look out!

323
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:07,946
What? Is it hot?

324
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,739
It's cold. Damn cold.

325
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,370
Einstein,
you little devil!

326
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,666
Einstein's clock is
exactly one minute

327
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,127
behind mine
and still ticking!

328
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:26,840
He's all right.
He's fine.

329
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,259
And he's completely unaware
that anything happened.

330
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,970
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

331
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,639
That's why his watch is
exactly one minute behind mine.

332
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,807
He skipped over
that minute

333
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,767
to instantly arrive
at this moment in time.

334
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,686
Come here. I'll show you how it works.

335
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,895
All right.

336
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,316
First, you turn
the time circuits on.

337
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,697
This readout tells you
where you're going.

338
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,990
This one tells you
where you are.

339
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,575
This one tells you
where you were.

340
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,994
You input your destination
time on this keypad.

341
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,328
Say you want to
see the signing

342
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,956
of the Declaration
of Independence.

343
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,043
Or witness
the birth of Christ.

344
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,465
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

345
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,260
November 5th, 1955.

346
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:20,351
Yes, of course.
November 5th, 1955.

347
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,937
What? I don't get it.
What happened?

348
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,984
That was the day I invented time
travel. I remember it vividly.

349
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,653
I was standing on the edge
of my toilet, hanging a clock.

350
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,863
The porcelain was wet.
I slipped,

351
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,489
hit my head on
the edge of the sink,

352
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,617
and when I came to,
I had a revelation,

353
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:39,037
a vision, a picture in my
head, a picture of this.

354
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,459
This is what makes time travel
possible. The flux capacitor.

355
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,336
Flux capacitor?

356
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,880
It's taken me almost 30 years
and my entire family fortune

357
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,382
to realize the vision
of that day.

358
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,718
My God,
has it been that long?

359
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,222
Things have certainly
changed around here.

360
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,058
I remember when
this was all farmland

361
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,268
as far as the eye
could see.

362
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,980
Old man Peabody
owned all of this.

363
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:10,818
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

364
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:18,409
This is heavy-duty, Doc.
This is great.

365
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,412
Does it run on regular
unleaded gasoline?

366
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,081
Unfortunately, no.
It requires something

367
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,291
with a little more kick.
Plutonium.

368
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,627
Plutonium.
Wait a minute.

369
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,088
Are you telling me that
this sucker is nuclear?

370
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,173
Hey, hey, hey! Keep
rolling. Keep rolling there.

371
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,092
No, no, no,
this sucker's electrical,

372
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,385
but I need
a nuclear reaction

373
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,929
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts
of electricity I need.

374
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,599
Doc, you don't just walk into
a store and buy plutonium.

375
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,851
Did you rip that off?

376
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,606
Of course. From a group
of Libyan nationalists.

377
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:49,899
They wanted me to
build them a bomb,

378
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,443
so I took their plutonium and, in
turn, gave them a shoddy bomb casing

379
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,237
full of used
pinball machine parts.

380
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,281
Come on. Let's get you
a radiation suit. Jesus!

381
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,740
We must prepare
to reload.

382
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,355
It's safe now.
Everything's lead-lined.

383
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,401
Don't you lose
those tapes now.

384
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,902
I need that
as a record.

385
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,864
Let's put this back here.
There we go.

386
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,993
I almost forgot
my luggage.

387
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,829
Who knows if they've got
cotton underwear in the future?

388
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,205
I'm allergic to
all synthetics.

389
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,915
The future?

390
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,709
That's where
you're going?

391
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,336
That's right,
25 years into the future.

392
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,464
I've always dreamed of seeing the
future, looking beyond my years,

393
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,674
seeing the progress
of mankind.

394
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:57,967
Why not?

395
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:01,846
I'll also be able to see who
wins the next 25 World Series.

396
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,348
Doc.

397
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,474
Huh?

398
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,060
Look me up when
you get there.

399
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,313
Indeed, I will.
Roll 'em.

400
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,113
I, Dr. Emmett Brown,

401
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,576
am about to embark on
an historic journey.

402
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,038
What am
I thinking of?

403
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,624
I almost forgot to
bring extra plutonium.

404
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,251
How did I ever expect to get
back? One pellet, one trip.

405
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,961
I must be
out of my mind.

406
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,591
What is it, Einie?

407
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,601
Oh, my God.

408
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,479
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

409
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,647
Run for it, Marty!

410
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,773
Who? Who?

411
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,651
Who do you think?
The Libyans!

412
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,447
Holy shit!

413
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,328
I'll draw their fire!

414
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,337
Doc, wait!

415
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,019
No!

416
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,814
You bastard!

417
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,959
Go! Damn Soviet gun.

418
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,008
Go!

419
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,218
Come on!
Move, damn it!

420
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:47,970
Jesus!

421
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,575
Holy shit!

422
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,037
Let's see if you
bastards can do 90.

423
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,216
What is it?
What is it, Pa?

424
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,220
Looks like an airplane
without wings.

425
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,599
That ain't no airplane.
Look.

426
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,912
Children!

427
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,331
Listen... Whoa.

428
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,219
Hello?

429
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,724
Excuse me.

430
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,395
Sorry about your barn.

431
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,444
It's already mutated
into human form! Shoot it!

432
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:12,698
Take that, you mutated
son of a bitch!

433
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,079
Get away!

434
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,414
Hold it.

435
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,375
Shoot it, Pa!

436
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:27,838
My pine! Why you...

437
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:33,302
You space bastard!
You killed our pine!

438
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,642
All right. All right.
Okay, McFly.

439
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,852
Get a grip on yourself.
It's all a dream.

440
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,730
It's just
a very intense dream.

441
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,233
Listen,
you got to help me.

442
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,610
Don't stop,
Wilbur! Don't!

443
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,655
It can't be.

444
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,079
This is nuts.

445
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,127
Come on.

446
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,421
Perfect.

447
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,373
Remember, fellow citizens,
the future is in your hands.

448
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,252
If you believe in progress,
re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

449
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,379
Progress is
his middle name.

450
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,048
Mayor Red Thomas'
progress platform

451
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,676
means more jobs,
better education,

452
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,554
bigger civic improvements
and lower taxes.

453
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,641
On election day, cast your
vote for a proven leader.

454
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,060
Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

455
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,524
This has got to
be a dream.

456
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,294
Hey, kid.
What'd you do? Jump ship?

457
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,378
What?

458
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,130
What's with
the life preserver?

459
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,387
I just want to
use the phone.

460
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,680
Yeah, it's in the back.

461
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,935
Brown.

462
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:54,730
Great. You're alive.

463
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,035
Come on.

464
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,336
Do you know where
1640 Riverside...

465
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,047
Are you going to
order something, kid?

466
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,009
Yeah. Give me a Tab.

467
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:27,304
Tab? I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

468
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,473
Right.
Give me a Pepsi Free.

469
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,309
You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're going to pay for it.

470
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:35,604
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, okay?

471
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,690
Something without sugar.

472
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,532
Hey, McFly.

473
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,245
What do you think
you're doing?

474
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:52,621
Biff.

475
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,374
I'm talking to you, McFly,
you Irish bug!

476
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,626
Hey, Biff. Hey, guys.
How are you doing?

477
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,461
You got my homework
finished, McFly?

478
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,798
Well, actually, I figured since
it wasn't due till Monday...

479
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,675
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home?

480
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,137
Think, McFly. Think!
Okay.

481
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,097
I got to have time
to recopy it.

482
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,348
You realize
what would happen

483
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,934
if I hand in my homework
in your handwriting?

484
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,728
I'll get kicked
out of school.

485
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,272
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

486
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,191
Would you?

487
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,317
Now, of course not,
Biff.

488
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,319
No. I wouldn't want that to happen.

489
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:25,946
What are you
looking at, butthead?

490
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,365
Biff, get a load of
this guy's life preserver.

491
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,159
Dork thinks he's
going to drown.

492
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,536
How about
my homework, McFly?

493
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:36,540
Okay, Biff. Well, I'll
finish that on up tonight

494
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,918
and then I'll bring it over
first thing tomorrow morning.

495
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,545
Not too early.
I sleep in Sundays.

496
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,921
Oh, McFly,
your shoe's untied!

497
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,175
Don't be so gullible, McFly. Okay.

498
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,342
I don't want to see
you in here again.

499
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,137
Okay. All right.
Bye-bye.

500
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:12,951
What?

501
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,328
You're George McFly.

502
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,246
Yeah. Who are you?

503
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,956
Say! Why do you
let those boys

504
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,541
push you around
like that for?

505
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,918
Well, they're
bigger than me.

506
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,629
Stand tall, boy. Have
some respect for yourself.

507
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,923
Don't you know, if you let
people walk over you now,

508
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,092
they'll be walking over you
for the rest of your life.

509
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,593
Look at me.
You think I'm gonna

510
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,345
spend the rest of my life
in this slop house?

511
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,222
Watch it, Goldie.
No, sir!

512
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,515
I'm gonna make
something of myself.

513
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,808
I'm going
to night school,

514
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:38,102
and one day,
I'm going to be somebody.

515
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,062
That's right.
He's going to be mayor.

516
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,522
Yeah, I'm...

517
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,565
Mayor!

518
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:48,237
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.

519
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,822
A colored mayor.
That'll be the day.

520
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:52,241
You wait and see, Mr.
Caruthers. I will be mayor.

521
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,618
I'll be the most powerful
man in Hill Valley,

522
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,495
and I'm going to
clean up this town.

523
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,540
Good. You can start
by sweeping the floor.

524
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:06,213
Mayor Goldie Wilson.
I like the sound of that.

525
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:22,146
Hey, Dad! George!
Hey, you on the bike!

526
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,470
He's a peeping Tom.

527
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,186
Dad!

528
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,034
Hey, wait a minute. Wait
a minute. Who are you?

529
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,872
Stella! Another one
of these damn kids

530
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,332
jumped in front
of my car!

531
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:27,502
Come on out here! Help
me take him in the house!

532
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,010
Mom? That you?

533
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:39,097
There,
there, now. Just relax.

534
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,770
You've been asleep for
almost nine hours now.

535
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,066
I had a horrible nightmare.

536
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:54,655
I dreamed that I went back
in time. It was terrible.

537
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,032
Well,

538
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:01,119
you're safe and sound now,
back in good old 1955.

539
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,622
1955?

540
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,213
You're my...
You're my...

541
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,464
My name is Lorraine.

542
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,092
Lorraine Baines.

543
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,260
Yeah.

544
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:20,055
But you're...
You're so...

545
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,642
You're so thin!

546
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,437
Just relax, Calvin. You got
a big bruise on your head.

547
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,568
Where are my pants?

548
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:36,738
Over there,
on my hope chest.

549
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,243
I've never seen purple
underwear before, Calvin.

550
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,830
Calvin? Why do you
keep calling me Calvin?

551
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,833
Well, that is your name,
isn't it? Calvin Klein?

552
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,044
It's written all over
your underwear.

553
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,839
Oh, I guess they
call you Cal, huh?

554
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,884
No, actually,
people call me Marty.

555
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,344
Oh.

556
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,389
Pleased to
meet you, Calvin.

557
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,683
Marty.

558
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,477
Klein.

559
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,153
Do you mind
if I sit here?

560
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,446
No. Fine.

561
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,906
No. Good.
Fine. Good.

562
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,119
That's a big bruise
you have there.

563
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,165
Lorraine,
are you up there?

564
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,250
Oh, my God!
It's my mother!

565
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,295
Quick!
Put your pants back on!

566
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:44,348
So, tell me, Marty, how
long have you been in port?

567
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,432
Excuse me?

568
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,516
I guessed
you're a sailor.

569
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,769
That's why you wear
that life preserver.

570
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,354
Coast Guard.

571
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,356
Sam, here's
the young man

572
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,857
you hit with your car
out there.

573
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,025
He's all right.
Thank God.

574
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,319
What were you doing in the middle
of the street, a kid your age?

575
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,321
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

576
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,989
Sam, you quit fiddling
with that thing.

577
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:02,491
Come in here
to dinner.

578
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,576
Now, let's see.
You already know Lorraine.

579
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,497
This is Milton, this
is Sally, that's Toby,

580
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:11,792
and over there in the
playpen is little baby Joey.

581
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,462
So, you're my uncle Joey.

582
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,715
Better get used
to these bars, kid.

583
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,928
Yes. Joey just loves
being in his playpen.

584
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:24,721
He cries whenever
we take him out,

585
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:26,807
so we just leave him
in there all the time.

586
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,101
Well, Marty, I hope
you like meatloaf.

587
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,395
Listen,
I really ought to...

588
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:32,687
Sit here, Marty.

589
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,148
Sam, stop fiddling
with that thing

590
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,692
and come in here
and eat your dinner.

591
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,238
Look at it roll.

592
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,365
Now we can watch Jackie
Gleason while we eat.

593
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,126
It's our first
television set.

594
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,836
Dad just
picked it up today.

595
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,797
Do you have
a television?

596
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,758
Well, yeah. You know
we have two of them.

597
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,636
Wow! You must be rich.

598
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,263
Oh, honey,
he's teasing you.

599
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,807
Nobody has two
television sets.

600
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:16,148
Hey. Hey,
I've seen this one.

601
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:17,649
I've seen this one!
This is a classic.

602
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:21,027
This is where Ralph dresses
up as a man from space.

603
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,531
What do you mean, you've
seen this? It's brand-new.

604
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,950
Yeah, well,
I saw it on a rerun.

605
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,494
What's a rerun?

606
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:30,704
You'll find out.

607
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:35,375
You know, Marty, you look so
familiar to me. Do I know your mother?

608
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,837
Yeah, I think
maybe you do.

609
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,505
Oh, then I want
to give her a call.

610
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,257
I don't want her
to worry about you.

611
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,717
You can't.

612
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:47,888
That is,
nobody's home.

613
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:50,265
Oh.

614
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,766
Yet.

615
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,393
Oh.

616
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,898
Listen, do you know
where Riverside Drive is?

617
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,483
It's on the other
end of town.

618
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,110
A block past Maple.
East end of town.

619
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:03,570
Wait a minute,
a block past Maple.

620
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,156
That's John F.
Kennedy Drive.

621
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,034
Who the hell
is John F. Kennedy?

622
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,410
Mother?

623
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:13,663
With Marty's parents
out of town,

624
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:16,625
don't you think he ought
to spend the night?

625
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:19,127
I mean, after all, Dad almost
killed him with the car.

626
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,296
That's true, Marty.

627
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,006
I think maybe you
should spend the night.

628
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,633
I think you're
our responsibility.

629
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,343
Gee, I don't know.

630
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,178
And he can sleep
in my room.

631
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,847
I gotta go!
I gotta go!

632
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:32,349
Thanks very much.
It was wonderful.

633
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:36,770
You were all great. See
you all later. Much later.

634
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:44,027
He's a very
strange young man.

635
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,237
He's an idiot.

636
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:49,282
Comes from upbringing. His
parents are probably idiots, too.

637
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:50,867
Lorraine,
you ever have a kid

638
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:53,245
who acts that way,
I'll disown you.

639
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,409
Doc?

640
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,869
Don't say a word.

641
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,247
I don't wanna
know your name.

642
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,498
I don't want to know
anything about you.

643
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,333
Listen, Doc...
Quiet!

644
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,918
Doc, it's me, Marty.
Don't tell me anything.

645
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:44,170
Doc, you got to help...
Quiet. Quiet.

646
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,925
I'm going to
read your thoughts.

647
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,596
Let's see now. You've come
here from a great distance?

648
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,805
Yeah. Exactly.

649
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,015
Don't tell me!

650
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,100
You want me to
buy a subscription

651
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,518
to the
Saturday Evening Post.

652
00:48:58,603 --> 00:48:59,644
No.

653
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:01,187
Not a word.
Not a word now!

654
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,439
Quiet.

655
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:08,194
Donations. You want me
to make a donation

656
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,530
to the Coast Guard
Youth Auxiliary.

657
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,532
Doc.

658
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:15,076
I'm from the future.

659
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:19,372
I came here in a time
machine that you invented.

660
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:24,544
Now, I need your help to
get back to the year 1985.

661
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,505
My God.

662
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,137
Do you know
what this means?

663
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:40,143
It means that this damn
thing doesn't work at all!

664
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,145
Doc, you got to help me.
You are the only one

665
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,564
who knows how your
time machine works.

666
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:48,485
Time machine? I haven't
invented any time machine.

667
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,822
Okay. All right,
I'll prove it to you.

668
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:56,076
Look at my driver's
license. Expires 1987.

669
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,661
Look at my birthday,
for crying out loud!

670
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,746
I haven't even
been born yet.

671
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,165
And look
at this picture.

672
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,250
It's my brother,
my sister and me.

673
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,629
Look at her sweatshirt, Doc.
"Class of 1984"?

674
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,590
Pretty mediocre
photographic fakery.

675
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,926
They cut off
your brother's hair.

676
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,845
I'm telling the truth, Doc.
You got to believe me.

677
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,014
Then tell me,
future boy,

678
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,936
Who's President of the
United States in 1985?

679
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,396
Ronald Reagan.

680
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,856
Ronald Reagan?
The actor?

681
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,985
Then who's vice president?
Jerry Lewis?

682
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,531
I suppose Jane Wyman
is the First Lady.

683
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,699
Whoa. Wait, Doc!

684
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,992
And Jack Benny is
secretary of the treasury.

685
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,494
Doc, you gotta
listen to me.

686
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,663
I've had enough practical
jokes for one evening.

687
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,914
Good night,
future boy!

688
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,374
No, wait, Doc. Doc.

689
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,252
The bruise on your head,
I know how that happened.

690
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,753
You told me
the whole story.

691
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:50,296
You were standing
on your toilet

692
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,423
and you were
hanging a clock,

693
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,717
and you fell and you hit
your head on the sink.

694
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,720
That's when you came up with
the idea for the flux capacitor,

695
00:50:56,804 --> 00:51:00,807
which is what makes
time travel possible.

696
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:18,074
There's something wrong with
the starter, so I hid it here.

697
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:32,422
After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

698
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,720
The flux capacitor.

699
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,864
It works!

700
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:01,951
It works!

701
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,955
I finally invent
something that works!

702
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,833
You bet your ass
it works.

703
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:12,796
Somehow we've got to sneak
this back to my laboratory.

704
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,798
We've got to
get you home!

705
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,258
Okay, Doc, this is it.

706
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,137
Never mind that.
Never mind that now.

707
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:24,641
Why, that's me! Look
at me! I'm an old man.

708
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:25,975
Good evening.
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

709
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,144
I'm standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.

710
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,230
Thank God,
I've still got my hair.

711
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,315
What's on Earth is
this thing I'm wearing?

712
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,567
This is a radiation suit.

713
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,402
Radiation suit?

714
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,489
Of course. 'Cause of all the
fallout from the atomic wars.

715
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:43,493
This is truly amazing.

716
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,830
A portable
television studio.

717
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,414
No wonder your president
has to be an actor.

718
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,667
He's gotta look good
on television.

719
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,169
Whoa. This is it. This is
the part coming up, Doc.

720
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,380
No, no, no,
this sucker's electrical,

721
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:56,506
but I need
a nuclear reaction

722
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,383
to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts...

723
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,260
What did I just say?

724
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:05,348
This sucker's electrical,

725
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,558
but I need
a nuclear reaction

726
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:08,351
to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts...

727
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,770
1.21 gigawatts!

728
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,482
1.21 gigawatts.

729
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,111
Great Scott!

730
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,490
What the hell
is a gigawatt?

731
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:27,579
How could I have been so
careless? 1.21 gigawatts!

732
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:30,373
Tom, how am I going to
generate that kind of power?

733
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,083
It can't be done,
can it?

734
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,919
Doc, look. All we need
is a little plutonium.

735
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,881
I'm sure that in 1985,

736
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,133
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore,

737
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,969
but in 1955, it's a
little hard to come by.

738
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,389
Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid you're stuck here.

739
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,640
Whoa, whoa.

740
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:52,145
Doc, stuck here? I can't be
stuck here. I got a life in 1985.

741
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,313
I got a girl.

742
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:54,439
Is she pretty?

743
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:58,943
Doc, she's beautiful.
She's crazy about me.

744
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:03,323
Look at this. Look what she wrote
here, Doc. I mean, that says it all.

745
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,160
Doc, you're my only hope.

746
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:11,164
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only
power source capable of generating

747
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,667
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

748
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,003
What did you say?

749
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,254
A bolt of lightning.

750
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,339
Unfortunately,
you never know

751
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:22,550
when or where it's
ever going to strike.

752
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,428
We do now.

753
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:34,103
This is it!
This is the answer.

754
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:37,273
It says here that
a bolt of lightning

755
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,358
is going to
strike the clock tower

756
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:41,694
at precisely 10:04 p. m.
Next Saturday night!

757
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,701
If we could somehow
harness this lightning,

758
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:53,122
channel it into
the flux capacitor,

759
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,209
it just might work.

760
00:54:56,502 --> 00:55:00,755
Next Saturday night, we're
sending you back to the future!

761
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,591
Okay, all right.
Saturday's good. Saturday's good.

762
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:05,468
I can spend
a week in 1955.

763
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,303
I can hang out.
You can show me around.

764
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,222
Marty, that is completely
out of the question.

765
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,640
You must not
leave this house.

766
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,725
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

767
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,395
Anything you do can have serious
repercussions on future events.

768
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,230
Do you understand?

769
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:20,066
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

770
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:21,901
Marty,

771
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,780
have you interacted with
anybody else today, besides me?

772
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,702
Yeah, well, I might've sort
of bumped into my parents.

773
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:32,328
Great Scott!

774
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,706
Let me see that photograph
again of your brother.

775
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:41,504
Just as I thought. This proves
my theory. Look at your brother.

776
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,967
His head's gone.
It's like it's been erased.

777
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,679
Erased from existence.

778
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,351
Whoa.

779
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:58,187
They really cleaned this
place up. Looks brand-new.

780
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,272
Now remember.

781
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,606
According to my theory,
you interfered

782
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,858
with your parents'
first meeting.

783
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,192
If they don't meet,
they won't fall in love,

784
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,069
they won't get married
and they won't have kids.

785
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,195
That's why your
older brother's

786
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,530
disappearing from
that photograph.

787
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,824
Your sister will follow, and
unless you repair the damage,

788
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,117
you'll be next.

789
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,036
Sounds pretty heavy. Weight
has nothing to do with it.

790
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:16,122
Which one's your pop?

791
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,624
That's him.

792
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,502
Okay.
Okay, you guys.

793
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,382
Very funny. You guys
are being real mature.

794
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,342
Maybe you were adopted.

795
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,970
Okay, real mature, guys.

796
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,264
Okay, pick up my books.

797
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,390
McFly.

798
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:36,184
That's Strickland.

799
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,728
Jesus, didn't that guy
ever have hair?

800
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,564
Shape up, man.
You're a slacker.

801
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,734
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

802
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:45,860
No.

803
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,779
What did your mother
ever see in that kid?

804
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,155
I don't know, Doc.

805
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,948
I guess she felt
sorry for him

806
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:53,367
'cause her dad hit him
with the car.

807
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,912
Hit me with the car.

808
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,997
That's the Florence
Nightingale effect.

809
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:01,417
It happens in hospitals when nurses
fall in love with their patients.

810
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:02,752
Go to it, kid.

811
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:06,422
Hey, George, buddy.

812
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,383
I have been looking
all over for you.

813
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:12,428
You remember me, the guy who
saved your life the other day?

814
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:13,596
Oh.

815
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,680
Yeah.
Good.

816
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,766
There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

817
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,772
Lorraine?

818
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:23,981
Calvin!

819
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,194
I'd like you to meet my
good friend George McFly.

820
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,531
Hi. It's really
a pleasure to meet you.

821
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:33,741
How's your head?

822
00:57:33,826 --> 00:57:35,159
Good. Fine.

823
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:37,120
Oh. I've been so
worried about you

824
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,080
ever since you ran off
the other night.

825
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,623
Are you okay?
Yeah.

826
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,126
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

827
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,460
Come on!

828
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,130
Isn't he a dreamboat?

829
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,844
Doc, she didn't
even look at him.

830
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:54,470
This is more serious
than I thought.

831
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,514
Apparently, your mother is
amorously infatuated with you,

832
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,224
instead of your father.

833
00:57:58,851 --> 00:57:59,976
Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.

834
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,729
Are you trying to tell me that
my mother has got the hots for me?

835
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:04,939
Precisely.

836
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,065
Whoa. This is heavy.

837
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,734
There's that word again.
"Heavy. "

838
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,153
Why are things so heavy
in the future?

839
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,321
Is there a problem with the
Earth's gravitational pull?

840
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:13,489
What?
The only way

841
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:14,991
we're going to get those
two to successfully mate

842
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,450
is if they're
alone together,

843
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:19,162
so you've got to get your
father and mother to interact

844
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,330
in some sort of social...

845
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,208
What? You mean like a date? Right!

846
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,502
What kind of date?
I don't know.

847
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:28,129
What do kids do
in the '50s?

848
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:31,007
They're your parents.
You must know them.

849
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,216
What are their
common interests?

850
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:34,260
What do they
like to do together?

851
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,345
Nothing.

852
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,640
Look! There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.

853
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,684
Of course! The Enchantment
Under the Sea dance!

854
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,144
They're supposed
to go to this.

855
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,979
That's where they kiss
for the first time.

856
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,439
All right, kid.

857
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,107
You stick to
your father like glue

858
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:49,734
and make sure he takes
her to that dance.

859
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,944
George, buddy.

860
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:56,032
Remember that girl I
introduced you to, Lorraine?

861
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,706
What are you writing?

862
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,791
Uh... Stories.

863
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:10,171
Science fiction stories
about visitors

864
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:13,883
coming down to Earth
from other planets.

865
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:19,597
Get out of town! I didn't
know you did anything creative.

866
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,224
Let me read some.

867
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:22,892
Oh. No, no, no, no.

868
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,811
I never let anybody
read my stories.

869
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,813
Why not?

870
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:30,107
Well, what if they
didn't like them?

871
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,652
What if they told me
I was no good?

872
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:37,573
I guess that would be pretty
hard for somebody to understand.

873
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,577
No. No, not hard at all.

874
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:45,331
So, anyway, George.
About Lorraine.

875
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,334
She really likes you.

876
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:52,255
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her

877
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,090
to the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

878
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,341
Really?
Oh, yeah.

879
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,511
All you got to do is go
over there and ask her.

880
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,597
What? Right here, right
now, in the cafeteria?

881
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:02,765
What if she said no?

882
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:06,310
I don't know if I could take
that kind of a rejection.

883
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:11,023
Besides, I think she'd
rather go with somebody else.

884
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,526
Who?

885
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,445
Biff.

886
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,115
Don't kid around.
Come on.

887
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,449
I'm gonna leave.

888
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,410
You want it.
You know you want it.

889
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:24,620
You know you want me
to give it to you.

890
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:27,290
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

891
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:31,294
Maybe you are and you
just don't know it yet.

892
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:33,212
Get your meat hooks
off of me.

893
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:34,338
You heard her.

894
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:37,800
She said,
get your meat hooks off.

895
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,469
Please.

896
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,389
So what's it to you,
butthead?

897
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,767
You know, you been
looking for a fight.

898
01:00:56,695 --> 01:01:00,740
Since you're new here, I'm
going to cut you a break, today.

899
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:06,329
So, why don't you make like
a tree and get out of here.

900
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,259
George!

901
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,637
Why do you keep
following me around?

902
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:26,682
Look, George...
I'm telling you, George,

903
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:28,517
if you do not ask
Lorraine to that dance,

904
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,102
I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

905
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,645
But I can't go
to the dance.

906
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,857
I'll miss my favorite television
program, Science Fiction Theatre.

907
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:38,319
Yeah, but, George, Lorraine
wants to go with you.

908
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,528
Give her a break.

909
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:43,783
Look, I'm just not ready to
ask Lorraine out to the dance,

910
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:47,787
and not you or anybody
else on this planet

911
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:50,456
is going to make me
change my mind.

912
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,256
Science Fiction Theatre.

913
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:31,872
Who are you?

914
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,505
Silence, Earthling.

915
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,426
My name is Darth Vader.

916
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:51,934
I am an extraterrestrial
from the planet Vulcan.

917
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,187
Marty!

918
01:02:58,358 --> 01:02:59,442
Marty! Marty!

919
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:00,609
Hey, George, buddy.

920
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:03,070
You weren't at school. What
have you been doing all day?

921
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:06,073
I overslept.
Look, I need your help.

922
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:07,616
I have to
ask Lorraine out,

923
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:08,784
but I don't know
how to do it.

924
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:11,704
All right. Okay, listen, keep your
pants on. She's over in the cafe.

925
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,831
God! How do you...

926
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,377
What made you change
your mind, George?

927
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:21,380
Last night, Darth Vader
came down from Planet Vulcan

928
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:25,384
and told me that if I didn't take
Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.

929
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:28,554
Let's just keep this brain-melting
stuff to ourselves, okay?

930
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,763
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

931
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:32,141
All right, okay.
There she is, George.

932
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,976
Now just go in there
and invite her.

933
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,644
Okay. But I don't
know what to say.

934
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:36,812
Just say anything,
George.

935
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:40,941
Say whatever's natural, the first
thing that comes into your mind.

936
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,486
Nothing's coming
to my mind.

937
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,279
Jesus, George, it's a
wonder I was even born.

938
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,322
What? What?

939
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:47,907
Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing.

940
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:52,578
Look, tell her destiny
brought you together.

941
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,580
Tell her that she is
the most beautiful girl

942
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,499
you have ever seen
in the world.

943
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,542
Girls like that stuff.

944
01:03:58,919 --> 01:03:59,919
What are you doing,
George?

945
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,795
I'm writing this down.
This is good stuff.

946
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,380
Yeah. Okay, let's go.

947
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:04,924
Can you take care of that? Right.

948
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:26,362
Lou, give me a milk.

949
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,114
Chocolate.

950
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:50,386
Lorraine. My density
has popped me to you.

951
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:52,972
What?

952
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,223
Oh.

953
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,726
What I meant
to say was...

954
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,896
Wait a minute. Don't I
know you from somewhere?

955
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:02,439
Yes.

956
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,652
Yes. I'm George.
George McFly.

957
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:08,946
I'm your density.

958
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,240
I mean,

959
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,076
your destiny.

960
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:16,370
Oh.

961
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,497
Hey, McFly.

962
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,838
I thought I told you
never to come in here.

963
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,551
Well, it's going
to cost you.

964
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,178
How much money
you got on you?

965
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:35,639
How much do
you want, Biff?

966
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,441
All right, punk.

967
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:46,525
Now I'm going to...

968
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,277
Whoa, whoa, Biff.
What's that?

969
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:58,037
That's Calvin Klein.
Oh, my God, he's a dream.

970
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,246
Whoa, whoa.

971
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:01,123
Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!

972
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,374
Hey!

973
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:05,628
I'll get it
back to you, all right?

974
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,380
You broke it!

975
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:09,798
Come back here!

976
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,761
Wow. Look at him go!

977
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:16,889
Get him!

978
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,404
To the car!
Go! Go!

979
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:39,953
What's that
thing he's on?

980
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:41,497
It's a board
with wheels.

981
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,165
He's an absolute dream.

982
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,458
Come on, come on!

983
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,085
Look out for the car!

984
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,102
Whoa!

985
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:21,245
I'm going
to ram him.

986
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:29,795
Shit!

987
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:42,474
Ooh!

988
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,739
Thanks a lot, kid.

989
01:07:57,866 --> 01:08:00,284
I'm going to get
that son of a bitch.

990
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:01,410
Where does
he come from?

991
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,370
Yeah,
where does he live?

992
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,666
I don't know,
but I'm going to find out.

993
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,840
Oh, my God.

994
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:18,343
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

995
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,095
Run for it, Marty!

996
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,185
Oh, my God.

997
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:29,897
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

998
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,356
Run for it, Marty!

999
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,734
Doc?

1000
01:08:34,486 --> 01:08:37,446
Hi, Marty. I didn't
hear you come in.

1001
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,949
Fascinating device,
this video unit.

1002
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,619
Listen, Doc.

1003
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:44,661
You know,
there's something

1004
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:45,913
I haven't told you
about the night

1005
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:47,331
we made that tape. Please,
Marty, don't tell me.

1006
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:48,707
No man should know too
much about his own destiny.

1007
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,167
You don't understand.
I do understand.

1008
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,460
If I know too much
about my own future,

1009
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:52,961
I can endanger
my own existence.

1010
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,380
Just as you've
endangered yours.

1011
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:59,259
You're right.
Now...

1012
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:02,221
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

1013
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:04,056
Please excuse the crudity
of this model.

1014
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,475
I didn't have time to build
it to scale or paint it.

1015
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,477
It's good.
Thank you. Thank you.

1016
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:10,979
Okay, now.

1017
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,273
We run some industrial-strength
electrical cable

1018
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:15,192
from the top of
the clock tower

1019
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,902
down, suspending it
over the street

1020
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,570
between these
two lamp posts.

1021
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,657
Meanwhile, we've
outfitted the time vehicle

1022
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,200
with this big pole
and hook,

1023
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:26,245
which runs directly
into the flux capacitor.

1024
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:31,834
At the calculated moment, you
start off from down the street,

1025
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,168
driving directly
toward the cable,

1026
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:36,171
accelerating to
88 miles per hour.

1027
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,883
According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 p. m. This Saturday night,

1028
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:43,595
lightning will strike the clock
tower, electrifying the cable

1029
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,931
just as the connecting
hook makes contact

1030
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:49,643
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor

1031
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,187
and sending you
back to 1985.

1032
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:54,314
All right, now.
Watch this.

1033
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,316
You wind up the car
and release it.

1034
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:00,320
I'll simulate
the lightning.

1035
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:09,788
Ready.

1036
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,674
Set.

1037
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:26,972
Release.

1038
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:47,534
You're instilling me with
a lot of confidence, Doc.

1039
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:48,994
Don't worry. I'll take
care of the lightning.

1040
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,663
You take care
of your pop.

1041
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:55,834
By the way, what happened
today? Did he ask her out?

1042
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,044
I think so.

1043
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,170
What did she say?

1044
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,597
It's your mom!
She's tracked you down!

1045
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,933
Quick! Let's cover
the time machine.

1046
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,740
Hi, Cal... Marty.

1047
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,659
Mom. Lorraine.

1048
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,412
How did you know
I was here?

1049
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:34,873
I followed you.

1050
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,709
Oh. This is my doc...

1051
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:40,879
My uncle,
Doc Brown.

1052
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:43,465
Hi.
Hi.

1053
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:49,721
Marty, this may
seem a little forward,

1054
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:54,309
but I was kind of
wondering if you'd ask me

1055
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:58,230
to the Enchantment Under
the Sea dance on Saturday.

1056
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:04,111
Wow, you mean... You
mean nobody's asked you?

1057
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:07,864
No. Not yet.

1058
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,118
What about George?

1059
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,995
George McFly?

1060
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:19,543
He's kind of cute
and all, but not...

1061
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:24,548
Well, I think
a man should be strong,

1062
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,719
so he can stand up
for himself

1063
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,014
and protect
the woman he loves.

1064
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:38,103
Don't you?

1065
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:40,689
Yeah.

1066
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:43,150
I still
don't understand.

1067
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:46,319
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her

1068
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:49,156
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

1069
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,908
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

1070
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:53,910
She just doesn't
know it yet.

1071
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:54,995
That's why
we got to show her

1072
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:57,039
that you, George McFly,
are a fighter.

1073
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,041
You're somebody who's
gonna stand up for yourself,

1074
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,584
somebody who's
gonna protect her.

1075
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,879
Yeah, but I've never picked
a fight in my entire life.

1076
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:06,715
Look, you're not going to
be picking a fight, Dad.

1077
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,009
Daddy-o.

1078
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,386
You're coming to
her rescue, right?

1079
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:12,637
Okay, let's go over
the plan again.

1080
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,473
8:55, where are
you going to be?

1081
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:16,141
I'm going to be
at the dance.

1082
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,267
Right. And where
am I going to be?

1083
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,352
You're gonna be
in the car with her.

1084
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:20,896
Right, okay.
So, right around 9:00,

1085
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,397
she's going to get
very angry with me.

1086
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,900
Why is she going to
get angry with you?

1087
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,319
Well, because, George,
nice girls get angry

1088
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,654
when guys take
advantage of them.

1089
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,909
You mean you're going
to go touch her on her...

1090
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,453
No. No, George, look.

1091
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,247
It's just an act, right?

1092
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:43,043
Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

1093
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:46,671
You see us struggling
in the car.

1094
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:50,258
You walk up, you open
the door, and you say...

1095
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,637
Your line, George.

1096
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,098
Oh!

1097
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:59,601
Hey, you, get your
damn hands off her!

1098
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:03,271
You really think
I ought to swear?

1099
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,356
Yes, definitely.

1100
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,066
God damn it,
George, swear.

1101
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,151
Okay.
So, now you come up.

1102
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:09,361
You punch me
in the stomach.

1103
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,238
I'm out for
the count, right?

1104
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:14,533
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

1105
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,827
You make it
sound so easy.

1106
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:19,371
I just... I wish
I wasn't so scared.

1107
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:20,705
George, there's nothing
to be scared of.

1108
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,333
All it takes is
a little self-confidence.

1109
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:26,128
You know, if you
put your mind to it,

1110
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:27,671
you can
accomplish anything.

1111
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,509
...Hill Valley area weather
this Saturday night.

1112
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,595
Mostly clear,
with some scattered clouds.

1113
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,389
Lows tonight in
the upper 40s.

1114
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,391
Are you sure
about this storm?

1115
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:44,396
Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future?

1116
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,566
You know, Marty, I'm going
to be very sad to see you go.

1117
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,859
You've really made
a difference in my life.

1118
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:51,069
You've given me
something to shoot for.

1119
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:55,323
Just knowing that I'm going
to be around to see 1985.

1120
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:57,325
That I'm going to
succeed in this!

1121
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,954
That I'm going to have a
chance to travel through time!

1122
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:09,087
It's going to be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you

1123
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:12,132
about everything that's
happened in the past few days.

1124
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:14,801
I'm really going
to miss you, Marty.

1125
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:17,971
I'm really going
to miss you.

1126
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,518
Doc, about the future...

1127
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:24,686
No!

1128
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,689
Marty!
We've already agreed

1129
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,065
that having information
about the future

1130
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,609
can be
extremely dangerous.

1131
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,194
Even if your
intentions are good,

1132
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,237
it can backfire
drastically.

1133
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:36,698
Whatever you've
got to tell me,

1134
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:39,868
I'll find out through
the natural course of time.

1135
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:42,871
"Dear Dr. Brown.

1136
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:46,082
"On the night that
I go back in time,

1137
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,293
"you will be

1138
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,171
"shot by terrorists.

1139
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:54,758
"Please take whatever
precautions are necessary

1140
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:57,302
"to prevent
this terrible disaster.

1141
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,430
"Your friend,

1142
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:02,724
"Marty. "

1143
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:15,111
'Evening, Dr. Brown.
What's with the wire?

1144
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:18,114
Oh, just a little
weather experiment.

1145
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:20,951
What you got
under here?

1146
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:22,035
No! Don't touch that!

1147
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:24,913
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

1148
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,207
You got a permit
for that?

1149
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,583
Of course I do.

1150
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:39,177
Just a second. Let me
see if I can find it here.

1151
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:35,900
Do you mind if we
park for a while?

1152
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,112
That's a great idea.
I'd love to park.

1153
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,196
Huh?

1154
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:42,991
Marty, I'm almost
18 years old.

1155
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,993
It's not like I've
never parked before.

1156
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:47,078
What?

1157
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:50,623
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?

1158
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:54,002
No.

1159
01:17:58,758 --> 01:18:01,176
Lorraine! Lorraine,
what are you doing?

1160
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,970
I swiped it from the old
lady's liquor cabinet.

1161
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:06,973
Yeah, well,
you shouldn't drink.

1162
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:08,016
Why not?

1163
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,142
Because you...

1164
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:12,645
You might regret it
later in life.

1165
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,607
Marty, don't be
such a square.

1166
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,609
Everybody who's
anybody drinks.

1167
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:24,616
Jeez, you smoke, too?

1168
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:28,995
Marty, you're beginning to
sound just like my mother.

1169
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:41,549
We're going to
take a little break,

1170
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,134
but we'll be back
in a while,

1171
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:45,804
so don't nobody
go nowhere.

1172
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:05,490
Marty?
Why are you so nervous?

1173
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,118
Lorraine.

1174
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:13,206
Have you ever
been in a situation

1175
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:15,083
where you knew you had
to act a certain way,

1176
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,335
but when you got there,
you didn't know

1177
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,170
if you could go
through with it?

1178
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,715
You mean like how you're
supposed to act on a first date?

1179
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,050
Sort of.

1180
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:27,512
I think I know
exactly what you mean.

1181
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,639
You do?

1182
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:32,767
You know what I do
in those situations?

1183
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:33,977
What?

1184
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,103
I don't worry.

1185
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:56,749
This is all wrong.
I don't know what it is.

1186
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:01,880
But when I kiss you,
it's like I'm kissing

1187
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:05,049
my brother.

1188
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:08,052
I guess that doesn't
make any sense, does it?

1189
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:12,140
Believe me,
it makes perfect sense.

1190
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:15,685
Somebody's coming.

1191
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:23,818
You caused 300 bucks damage
to my car, you son of a bitch.

1192
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:27,197
And I'm going to take it
out of your ass. Hold him.

1193
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,533
Let him go, Biff.
You're drunk.

1194
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:33,828
Well, look-ey
what we have here.

1195
01:20:36,624 --> 01:20:40,251
No, no! You're staying right
here with me. Come on, Lorraine.

1196
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:41,377
Let me go!

1197
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:42,712
Leave her alone,
you bastard!

1198
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,631
Take him in back, all
right? I'll be right there.

1199
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:47,800
Just admit that you want it. Come on.

1200
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:50,178
Well, go on.
This ain't no peep show.

1201
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:58,061
Hey, let's put him
in there.

1202
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,521
Yeah!

1203
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,274
That's for
messing up my hair.

1204
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,443
What the hell are
you doing to my car?

1205
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,987
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

1206
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:13,159
Who you calling "spook,"
peckerwood?

1207
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,287
Hey, hey,
listen, guys...

1208
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:18,957
Look, I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, okay?

1209
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:20,875
Get home to
your mama, boy.

1210
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,043
Biff!

1211
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:23,211
Hurry, Biff!

1212
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,588
Let me out of here!

1213
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,883
Reginald,
where are your keys?

1214
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:31,135
The keys
are in the trunk.

1215
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:32,720
Say that again?

1216
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,639
I said,
the keys are in here.

1217
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:49,654
Come on!

1218
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,492
Hey, you,
get your damn hands off...

1219
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:57,620
Oh.

1220
01:21:57,705 --> 01:22:00,331
I think you got
the wrong car, McFly.

1221
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,668
George, help me!
Please!

1222
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,629
Just turn around, McFly,
and walk away.

1223
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:08,673
Please, George.

1224
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:09,841
Are you deaf, McFly?

1225
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,010
Close the door
and beat it.

1226
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:18,182
No, Biff.
You leave her alone.

1227
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,727
All right, McFly.

1228
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:27,609
You're asking for it, and
now you're going to get it.

1229
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:30,486
Biff, stop it!

1230
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,781
Biff, you'll
break his arm!

1231
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:36,534
Biff, no!

1232
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:39,662
Give me
a hand here, Reginald.

1233
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:43,291
Damn it, man!
I sliced my hand!

1234
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,834
Whose are these?
Mine.

1235
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:46,836
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1236
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:50,048
You're going to
break his arm!

1237
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:53,843
Biff! Biff,
leave him alone!

1238
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:56,387
Let him go!
Let him go!

1239
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,130
Are you okay?

1240
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,528
Who is that guy?

1241
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:54,821
That's George McFly.

1242
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,702
That's George McFly?

1243
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:02,078
Excuse me.

1244
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,841
The storm.

1245
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:19,512
Hey, guys, you gotta get back
in there and finish the dance.

1246
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,013
Hey, man.
Look at Marvin's hand.

1247
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:22,223
He can't play with
his hand like that,

1248
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,433
and we can't
play without him.

1249
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,977
Yeah, well. Look,
Marvin, you got to play.

1250
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,229
See, that's where they kiss for
the first time on the dance floor.

1251
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:30,022
And if there's no music,
they can't dance.

1252
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:31,399
If they can't dance,
they can't kiss.

1253
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,860
If they can't kiss, they can't
fall in love and I'm history.

1254
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:35,111
Hey, man,
the dance is over

1255
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:37,739
unless you know somebody
else that can play the guitar.

1256
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:47,540
This is for all
you lovers out there.

1257
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:54,172
Earth angel, Earth angel

1258
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,550
Will you be mine?

1259
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:00,803
My darling dear

1260
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,431
George, aren't you
going to kiss me?

1261
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,016
I don't know.

1262
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,936
Scram, McFly.
I'm cutting in.

1263
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:19,906
Earth angel, Earth angel

1264
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:22,408
The one I adore

1265
01:25:22,493 --> 01:25:24,494
Hey, boy,
you all right?

1266
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,079
I can't play.

1267
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:28,247
George!

1268
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:46,974
George!

1269
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:49,560
George.

1270
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:54,023
Excuse me.

1271
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:06,077
The vision of your happiness

1272
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:11,457
Earth angel, Earth angel

1273
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:15,336
Please be mine

1274
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:18,047
My darling dear

1275
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:21,425
Love you for all time

1276
01:26:22,219 --> 01:26:25,471
I'm just a fool

1277
01:26:26,557 --> 01:26:29,600
A fool in love

1278
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:34,272
with you

1279
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:45,032
Yeah, man, that was good.
Let's do another one.

1280
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:47,034
No. I got to go.

1281
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:50,621
Come on, man. Let's do
something that really cooks.

1282
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,499
Something that cooks.

1283
01:26:58,881 --> 01:26:59,922
All right.

1284
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:01,007
All right!

1285
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:06,387
All right.

1286
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:10,725
All right,
this is an oldie, but...

1287
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:16,105
Well, it's an oldie
where I come from.

1288
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,401
All right, guys, listen,
this is a blues riff in B.

1289
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:23,529
Watch me for the changes,
and try and keep up, okay?

1290
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:43,299
Way down in Louisiana
Down in New Orleans

1291
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:46,135
Way back up in the woods
among the evergreens

1292
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:49,055
There stood a log cabin
made of earth and wood

1293
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:51,766
Where lived a country boy
name of Johnny B. Goode

1294
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,518
He never ever learned
to read or write so well

1295
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:57,188
He could play the guitar
just like he's ringing a bell

1296
01:27:57,314 --> 01:28:01,275
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go

1297
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:03,861
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1298
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:06,280
Go, Johnny, go, go

1299
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:08,991
Hey, George, I heard you
laid out Biff. Nice going.

1300
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:11,369
George, you ever think of
running for class president?

1301
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,871
Johnny B. Goode

1302
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,876
Go, Johnny, go, go

1303
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,629
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1304
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:24,465
Go, Johnny, go, go

1305
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:26,759
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1306
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:30,221
Johnny B. Goode

1307
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:35,309
Chuck!
Chuck, it's Marvin.

1308
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:37,979
Your cousin,
Marvin Berry.

1309
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:40,815
You know that new sound
you're looking for?

1310
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,775
Well, listen to this.

1311
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:55,306
I guess you guys aren't
ready for that yet.

1312
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,267
But your kids are
going to love it.

1313
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:03,898
Lorraine.

1314
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:06,567
Marty, that was
very interesting music.

1315
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:08,235
Yeah.

1316
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:10,237
I hope you don't mind,

1317
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,364
but George asked if
he could take me home.

1318
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:15,534
Great! Good.
Good, Lorraine.

1319
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:17,036
I had a feeling
about you two.

1320
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:19,455
I have a feeling, too.

1321
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,207
Listen, I got to go,

1322
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:26,003
but I wanted to tell you
that it's been educational.

1323
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:29,507
Marty, will we ever
see you again?

1324
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:31,926
I guarantee it.

1325
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:35,429
Well, Marty, I want to thank
you for all your good advice.

1326
01:30:35,514 --> 01:30:37,848
I'll never forget it.

1327
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:40,142
Right, George.

1328
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,022
Well, good luck,
you guys.

1329
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:47,691
Oh!

1330
01:30:49,027 --> 01:30:52,947
One other thing. If
you guys ever have kids,

1331
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:55,449
and one of them,
when he's eight years old,

1332
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:58,536
accidentally sets fire
to the living room rug,

1333
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,497
go easy on him.

1334
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:03,791
Okay.

1335
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:11,507
Marty.
Such a nice name.

1336
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,598
Damn!
Where is that kid?

1337
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,061
Damn!

1338
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:27,898
Damn! Damn!

1339
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:38,617
You're late! Do you
have no concept of time?

1340
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:41,078
Hey, come on.
I had to change.

1341
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:44,081
Do you think I'm going
back in that zoot suit?

1342
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:46,834
The old man really
came through. It worked.

1343
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:49,003
He laid out Biff
in one punch.

1344
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,171
I didn't know
he had it in him.

1345
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:53,465
He's never stood up
to Biff in his life.

1346
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:56,010
Never?

1347
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:57,845
No. Why?
What's the matter?

1348
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:02,641
All right! Let's set
your destination time.

1349
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:09,732
This is the exact time
you left.

1350
01:32:10,108 --> 01:32:13,569
Let's send you back at
exactly the same time.

1351
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,657
It'll be like
you never left.

1352
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:24,830
Now, I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

1353
01:32:24,915 --> 01:32:26,790
That's where
you'll start from.

1354
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:29,210
I've calculated
the precise distance,

1355
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:31,962
taking into account
the acceleration speed

1356
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:33,797
and wind resistance
retroactive

1357
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:36,508
from the moment
the lightning strikes,

1358
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:41,096
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

1359
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:43,849
When this alarm goes off,
you hit the gas.

1360
01:32:43,934 --> 01:32:45,017
Right.

1361
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:54,860
Well, I guess
that's everything.

1362
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:00,532
Thanks.

1363
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:01,825
Thank you.

1364
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,958
See you
in about 30 years.

1365
01:33:10,669 --> 01:33:12,002
I hope so.

1366
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:15,214
Don't worry!

1367
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:17,591
As long as you
hit that wire

1368
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:20,761
with the connecting hook at
precisely 88 miles an hour,

1369
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:23,847
the instant the lightning
strikes the tower

1370
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:27,434
everything will be fine.

1371
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:28,686
Right.

1372
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39,530
What's the meaning
of this?

1373
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:41,282
You'll find out
in 30 years.

1374
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:43,450
It's about the future,
isn't it?

1375
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:44,618
It's information
about the future.

1376
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:46,245
Wait a minute.

1377
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:48,247
I warned you
about this, kid.

1378
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:51,166
The consequences
could be disastrous!

1379
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:53,669
Doc, that's a risk you're
going to have to take.

1380
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:55,337
Your life depends on it!

1381
01:33:55,422 --> 01:33:56,588
No!

1382
01:33:57,048 --> 01:34:00,384
I refuse to accept
the responsibility.

1383
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,678
In that case, I'll
tell you straight out.

1384
01:34:07,434 --> 01:34:08,851
Great Scott!

1385
01:34:16,776 --> 01:34:19,820
You get the cable, I'll
throw the rope down to you.

1386
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,697
Right! I got it!

1387
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:57,149
Doc!

1388
01:35:04,783 --> 01:35:06,367
Come on, come on.
Let's go!

1389
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:09,119
All right!
Take it up!

1390
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:13,457
Go!

1391
01:35:20,507 --> 01:35:21,507
Doc!

1392
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:22,633
What?

1393
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:26,136
I have to tell you
about the future.

1394
01:35:26,346 --> 01:35:27,388
What?

1395
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:30,724
I have to tell you
about the future!

1396
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:32,142
What?

1397
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:37,064
On the night I go
back in time, you get...

1398
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:41,819
Doc!

1399
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:52,287
Go!

1400
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:54,248
No, Doc!

1401
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:55,582
Look at the time!

1402
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:59,670
You've got less than four
minutes. Please, hurry!

1403
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:12,599
Yeah!

1404
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:09,114
Damn it, Doc! Why did you
have to tear up that letter?

1405
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:11,158
If I only had more time.

1406
01:37:14,162 --> 01:37:16,538
Wait a minute.
I got all the time I want.

1407
01:37:16,623 --> 01:37:20,209
I got a time machine. I can
just go back early and warn him.

1408
01:37:20,293 --> 01:37:22,836
Okay. Ten minutes
ought to do it.

1409
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:29,676
Okay. Time circuit's on.
Flux capacitor, fluxing.

1410
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:32,262
Engine running.
All right.

1411
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:37,100
No. No, no.

1412
01:37:38,645 --> 01:37:40,854
Come on. Not this time.
Come on. Come on.

1413
01:38:51,301 --> 01:38:52,593
Come on.

1414
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:57,806
Here we go. Here we go.
This time. Come on.

1415
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,977
Please. Please.
Come on!

1416
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:41,702
Doc.

1417
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:19,966
Crazy drunk driver.

1418
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:31,895
Whoo!

1419
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:37,359
All right. Fred.

1420
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:41,655
You look great.
Everything looks great.

1421
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:46,910
1:24. I still got time.
I'm coming, Doc!

1422
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:55,335
No! No, not again!
Come on! Come on!

1423
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:10,433
Libyans.

1424
01:43:33,082 --> 01:43:34,124
No!

1425
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:36,960
You bastard!

1426
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:51,641
Go!

1427
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,136
Doc! Doc!

1428
01:44:33,601 --> 01:44:35,769
No! No!

1429
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:52,202
You're alive.

1430
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,046
Bulletproof vest?

1431
01:45:04,382 --> 01:45:06,049
How did you know?

1432
01:45:06,842 --> 01:45:09,260
I never got a chance
to tell you.

1433
01:45:22,817 --> 01:45:26,861
What about all that talk about
screwing up future events?

1434
01:45:26,946 --> 01:45:29,030
The space-time continuum?

1435
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:32,409
Well, I figured,
what the hell?

1436
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:44,587
So, how far ahead
are you going?

1437
01:45:44,672 --> 01:45:47,674
About 30 years.
It's a nice, round number.

1438
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:52,220
Look me up when you get there,
all right? Guess I'll be about 47.

1439
01:45:52,304 --> 01:45:53,555
I will.

1440
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:55,390
Take care.

1441
01:45:56,142 --> 01:45:57,350
You, too.

1442
01:45:57,435 --> 01:45:59,769
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.

1443
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:03,273
Oh. And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

1444
01:46:03,983 --> 01:46:05,275
You bet.

1445
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:11,883
What a nightmare.

1446
01:47:23,229 --> 01:47:26,189
If Paul calls me, tell him I'm
working at the boutique late tonight.

1447
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:28,358
Linda, first of all, I'm
not your answering service,

1448
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:29,984
second of all,
somebody named Greg

1449
01:47:30,069 --> 01:47:31,945
or Craig called you
just a little while ago.

1450
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:33,613
Well, which one was it,
Greg or Craig?

1451
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:36,407
I don't know! I can't keep up
with all of your boyfriends.

1452
01:47:36,492 --> 01:47:37,617
Hey.

1453
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:40,370
What the hell is this?

1454
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:42,205
Breakfast.

1455
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:45,125
Did you sleep in your
clothes again last night?

1456
01:47:45,209 --> 01:47:46,543
Yeah. I...

1457
01:47:47,545 --> 01:47:50,088
Yeah. What are
you wearing, Dave?

1458
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:53,216
Marty, I always wear
a suit to the office.

1459
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:56,761
You all right?
Yeah.

1460
01:47:57,555 --> 01:47:58,638
I think we
need a rematch, George.

1461
01:47:58,722 --> 01:47:59,764
A rematch?

1462
01:47:59,849 --> 01:48:00,890
Why? Were you cheating?

1463
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:01,975
No.

1464
01:48:02,059 --> 01:48:03,935
Hello.
Good morning.

1465
01:48:06,021 --> 01:48:07,522
Mom! Dad!

1466
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:09,482
Did you hit your head?
Marty, are you all right?

1467
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:13,570
You guys look great.
Mom, you look so thin.

1468
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:16,447
Why, thank you, Marty.
George!

1469
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:19,993
Good morning,
sleepyhead.

1470
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:22,287
Good morning, Dave.
Linda.

1471
01:48:22,371 --> 01:48:23,746
Good morning, Mom.

1472
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:26,332
Marty, I almost forgot.
Jennifer Parker called.

1473
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:30,044
I sure like her, Marty.
She is such a sweet girl.

1474
01:48:30,588 --> 01:48:32,589
Isn't tonight the night
of the big date?

1475
01:48:32,673 --> 01:48:34,632
What? What, Ma?

1476
01:48:34,717 --> 01:48:36,092
Aren't you going up
to the lake tonight?

1477
01:48:36,177 --> 01:48:38,845
You've been planning it
for two weeks.

1478
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:41,598
Mom, we talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

1479
01:48:41,682 --> 01:48:42,807
The car's wrecked.

1480
01:48:42,892 --> 01:48:44,475
Wrecked?
Wrecked?

1481
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,685
When did this happen?
Why wasn't I told?

1482
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:46,769
Quiet down.

1483
01:48:46,854 --> 01:48:48,354
I'm sure the car is fine.

1484
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:50,690
Why am I always the last one
to know about these things?

1485
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:53,860
See? There's Biff out
there waxing it right now.

1486
01:48:54,278 --> 01:48:55,695
Now, Biff, I want
to make sure that

1487
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:58,615
we get two coats of wax
this time, not just one.

1488
01:48:58,699 --> 01:49:00,283
I'm just finishing up
the second coat now.

1489
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:02,952
Now, Biff,
don't con me.

1490
01:49:04,455 --> 01:49:06,497
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1491
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:09,667
I meant I was just
starting on the second coat.

1492
01:49:10,753 --> 01:49:14,589
Biff. What a character. Always
trying to get away with something.

1493
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:18,051
I've had to stay on top of
Biff ever since high school.

1494
01:49:18,135 --> 01:49:20,220
Although,
if it wasn't for him...

1495
01:49:20,304 --> 01:49:21,888
We never would
have fallen in love.

1496
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:23,431
That's right.

1497
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,684
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly,
this just arrived.

1498
01:49:26,769 --> 01:49:29,562
Oh, hi, Marty. I think
it's your new book.

1499
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:35,985
Honey!
Your first novel.

1500
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:37,111
Like I've
always told you,

1501
01:49:37,196 --> 01:49:40,114
you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

1502
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:42,700
Oh, Marty,
here's your keys.

1503
01:49:42,785 --> 01:49:44,577
You're all waxed up,
ready for tonight.

1504
01:49:45,162 --> 01:49:46,329
Keys?

1505
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,305
How about a ride,
mister?

1506
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,515
Jennifer.

1507
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:10,603
Oh, are you a sight for sore
eyes! Let me look at you.

1508
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:14,232
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

1509
01:50:14,316 --> 01:50:15,733
I haven't.

1510
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:19,570
You okay?
Is everything all right?

1511
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:23,992
Oh, yeah.

1512
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:27,996
Everything is great.

1513
01:50:42,219 --> 01:50:46,472
Marty! You've got to come back with me!

1514
01:50:47,266 --> 01:50:48,474
Where?

1515
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:49,726
Back to the future.

1516
01:50:54,356 --> 01:50:56,482
Wait a minute.
What are you doing, Doc?

1517
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:58,568
I need fuel.

1518
01:51:02,031 --> 01:51:04,449
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.

1519
01:51:04,533 --> 01:51:06,576
No, no. Doc,
I just got here, okay?

1520
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,661
Jennifer's here. We're gonna
take the new truck for a spin.

1521
01:51:08,746 --> 01:51:11,998
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.

1522
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:13,666
Wait a minute, Doc. What
are you talking about?

1523
01:51:13,751 --> 01:51:15,793
What happens to us
in the future?

1524
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:17,628
Do we become assholes
or something?

1525
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:18,838
No, no, no,
no, Marty.

1526
01:51:18,922 --> 01:51:20,673
Both you and Jennifer
turn out fine.

1527
01:51:20,758 --> 01:51:22,216
It's your kids, Marty.

1528
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:24,552
Something has got to
be done about your kids.

1529
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:34,020
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't
have enough road to get up to 88.

1530
01:51:34,104 --> 01:51:38,274
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.
