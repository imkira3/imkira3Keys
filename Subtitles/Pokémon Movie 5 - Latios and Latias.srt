- [Girl #1] Yes. It tells everything.

- [Girl #1] All about Latios and Latias.
- [Girl #2] Also about the jewel, right?

28
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:31,366
[Girl #1] Right. But the last chapter

So, tell me what
the last chapter's about, Oakley.

35
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:21,079
It tells all about
how to operate a machine,

36
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:24,683
something called
the defense mechanism of Altomare.

It's amazing.

According to that book,
it's the most powerful weapon ever built.

I'm not really interested in that.

I care much more

It turns out you have to use
the Soul Dew to power it.

43
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:56,284
Why do they call it the Soul Dew?

44
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:59,088
They say it contains
the soul of a Latios,

45
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:01,152
and it looks like a giant dewdrop.

46
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,633
Speaking of Latios, we have to remember
to capture those Pokémon for Giovanni.

47
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:07,464
Right.

Are they just statues,
or do they really exist?

154
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:58,669
They say they do.

155
00:11:58,743 --> 00:12:01,871
- I sure would like to see the real ones.
- Pika.

156
00:12:01,946 --> 00:12:02,970
Me, too.

157
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:06,278
- I bet they're really cool.
- [Ross] Yeah.

158
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:10,185
I guess we never see them because things
are always so peaceful around here,

159
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:13,247
we haven't really needed
their protection.

160
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:37,005
[Annie] If these Latios and Latias
are supposed to be guarding the town,

161
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:38,810
how come we haven't seen them yet?

162
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,044
[Oakley] It's not that simple.

163
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:43,917
The book said they can take on
a completely different shape,

164
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:46,081
even human beings, if they want to.

165
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:48,591
- That's pretty cool.
- Yeah, it is.

166
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,289
But they're still Pokémon,
so this scanner will find them.

167
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:55,696
They have lower body temperatures than us.
Bingo.

168
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,701
That's one of them.

169
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,330
Let's go pay our new friend
a visit, shall we?

170
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,181
We all scream for ice cream!

171
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,150
[Yelling, moaning]

172
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:16,153
- Was that Team Rocket?
- Huh?

173
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,087
- They didn't spot us, did they?
- Who are they?

174
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:24,685
They're spies for Giovanni.

175
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,196
Don't tell me you've never heard
of Annie and Oakley.

176
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,792
This could be just the chance
we've been waiting for.

177
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:33,804
Why don't we follow them?
They're obviously up to no good.

178
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:36,466
Yeah, and that could be good for us.

179
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,135
Besides, they owe me
a chocolate chip mint.

180
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,804
Wobbuffet!

181
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,645
[Ross] That place has great seafood,
and if you're still hungry,

182
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:49,050
there's an ice cream place
around the corner.

183
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,851
- [Misty] Thanks for everything, Ross.
- [Ross] Any time. Enjoy your stay.

184
00:13:52,924 --> 00:13:53,982
[All] We will!

185
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:55,457
- [Ross] <i>Ciao!</i>
- [All] <i>Ciao!</i>

186
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:57,551
- [Brock] Ice cream?
- [Ash] Absolutely.

187
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,723
- [Brock] Let's go.
- [Misty] I hope they have pistachio.

188
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:05,131
Pika?

189
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:06,500
Pika-pika!

190
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:08,766
- Come on, Vaporeon.
- [Trilling]

191
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,074
Pika!

192
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:15,505
Pika.

193
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,569
Pi?

194
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:20,778
Pika!

195
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:23,878
[Delighted squeals]

196
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:28,291
- Pikachu, don't you want any ice cream?
- Pika-pika!

197
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:30,884
Come on. Let's go.

198
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:33,095
Hmm?

199
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,600
Uh... uh... ah...

200
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,568
Pika?

201
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:47,367
- Pika?
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.

202
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:51,507
[Giggling]

203
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:53,209
Hi!

204
00:14:59,257 --> 00:15:02,920
[Oakley] She's taken on the form of a girl,
so that must be Latias.

205
00:15:02,994 --> 00:15:05,428
Is she kidding?
With that hairstyle?

206
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:08,393
[Annie] Amazing.

207
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:11,731
She really is a Pokémon.

208
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:17,735
Excuse me.

209
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:21,108
I love that shirt.
Where'd you get it, Latias?

210
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:24,972
- Espeon.
- Ariados.

211
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:29,281
- Ari! Ari!
- Espe! Espe!

212
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,081
Pika-pi!

213
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:36,560
Wait, Pikachu.

214
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,291
Ari!

215
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,429
Ari! Ari!

216
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:59,171
Why did you run away?
We just wanted to tell you something

217
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,310
- about the shirt you're wearing.
- It's last year's color.

218
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:04,651
- [Laughing]
- [Ash] Hey!

219
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,982
- What do you think you're doing?
- Pika!

220
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:11,222
We're just trying to prevent
a fashion disaster.

221
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:12,887
Well, this is no way to do it.

222
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:15,797
Oh? Would you like to give her
some tips instead?

223
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,027
Yes, please do.

224
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,899
- I've got a tip for you. Leave her alone.
- Pikachu!

225
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:22,405
Oh, I didn't know
she had a bodyguard.

226
00:16:22,473 --> 00:16:24,338
You're not going to hurt us, are you?

227
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:27,037
Whatever would we do
if he attacked us, Annie?

228
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,875
Espeon, show Oakley what we would do.

229
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,175
Espeon!

230
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:34,013
[Groaning]

231
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:37,543
That was a dirty trick.
Two can play at this game.

232
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,489
- Pikachu, get him.
- Pika!

233
00:16:40,558 --> 00:16:42,355
Espeon! Espe!

234
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:44,622
Pikachu, thunderbolt them!

235
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:46,686
Pika-chu!

236
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:48,698
[Screaming]

237
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,499
Come on. Let's go.

238
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:53,434
Pika-chu!

239
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:58,135
This was a very expensive outfit,
and now it's completely ruined.

240
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:02,111
- Espeon, go after them, now!
- You, too. Capture them.

241
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,172
- Espe! Espe!
- Ari! Ari!

242
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:22,965
[Panting]

243
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,418
- Pika!
- Come on.

244
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:50,492
[Ash, Pikachu panting]

245
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,763
Let's see. Uh...

246
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:05,943
[struggling] Hey!

247
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,773
Have you seen my new boat?

248
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:13,342
Hey, where are we going?

249
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,549
- Huh?
- Pika?

250
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:22,286
[Misty] Ash, we're going to the museum.

251
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,488
[Brock] The ice cream is great.
You should've got some.

252
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,430
We're right back where we started.

253
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:30,831
Who were those people anyway?

254
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,837
Where'd she disappear to?

255
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:49,243
- [All gasp]
- Pika!

256
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:50,443
[Brock] Cool.

257
00:18:50,518 --> 00:18:53,419
[Ash] It looks more like a palace
than a museum.

258
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:03,254
[Oakley] I found the kid and that Pikachu.

259
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:06,892
But it doesn't look like he's
hanging out with Latias anymore.

260
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:09,334
We need to keep it that way.

261
00:19:24,752 --> 00:19:27,084
Is this a fossil of a Pokémon?

262
00:19:27,154 --> 00:19:30,453
[Lorenzo] You might say that.
It's also a reminder of our past.

263
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:34,119
These fossils are of Pokémon
that once terrorized Altomare.

264
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:35,389
[Brock] Wow.

265
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:38,227
[Lorenzo] One was an Aerodactyl,
and the other was a...

266
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,096
- [Misty] Kabutops?
- That's right.

267
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:43,664
Come have a look over here.

268
00:19:43,838 --> 00:19:48,605
This is called the D.M.A.,
the Defense Mechanism of Altomare.

269
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:50,541
[Yelling]

270
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:55,573
I have seen the light.

271
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:58,584
I will definitely meet a girl in this town.

272
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:01,382
- Just don't hold your breath.
- [Chirping]

273
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:03,480
[Lorenzo] Long ago,
the Aerodactyl and Kabutops

274
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:06,219
were taught by an evil trainer
to attack people.

275
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:10,195
So, everyone lived in fear until Latios came
and brought water to the town,

276
00:20:10,264 --> 00:20:13,791
drowning the evil Pokémon
and turning our streets into canals.

277
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:18,134
That's when the town was named Altomare,
which means "high sea."

278
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:20,867
That's also when they built the D.M. A...

279
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:25,139
They wanted to make sure that no one
would ever disrupt their peace again.

280
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:27,476
- Fortunately, they never had to use it.
- [Gasping]

281
00:20:30,484 --> 00:20:33,248
- It's just a sacred monu...
- Wait a sec.

282
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:35,314
- It's her.
- [Gasping]

283
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:38,256
- Don't touch it!
- It was an accident.

284
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:40,759
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

285
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,530
Thanks for the tour, mister.
It was really interesting.

286
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:50,763
See you guys later.

287
00:20:50,838 --> 00:20:54,330
- Where is he going?
- I don't know.

288
00:20:58,846 --> 00:21:02,111
Which way did she go?

289
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:04,651
There she is.
Now's our chance.

290
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:08,548
Come on, Pikachu.

291
00:21:27,141 --> 00:21:28,972
Hey, wait up!

292
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:42,652
- Careful.
- Sorry.

293
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,323
- Hey!
- Pika!

294
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:52,195
Why'd you disappear like that before?

295
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,756
I don't know you.

296
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:55,893
Hey! Wait!

297
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,448
Huh?

298
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:22,523
Let's try this way.

299
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:28,534
- Murkrow!
- Murkrow!

300
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:31,332
- Pika?
- [Buzzing]

301
00:22:33,507 --> 00:22:35,498
- Where is she?
- Pika.

302
00:22:35,576 --> 00:22:38,272
She acted like she'd never seen me before.

303
00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:40,609
- Pika!
- Huh?

304
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:43,576
There you are.

305
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:46,586
Hey, what's the big idea?

306
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:13,610
Slow down, will ya?

307
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:24,154
[Gasping]

308
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:41,898
[Cooing]

309
00:23:49,817 --> 00:23:50,977
Hey!

310
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:56,552
Pika. Pi-ka...

311
00:23:56,624 --> 00:23:57,852
Pikachu!

312
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:15,563
- [Gasping]
- Pika-pi!

313
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,102
- Pika!
- Ah!

314
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:35,922
- [Yelping]
- [Buzzing]

315

[Twittering]

316
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,264
This place is amazing.

317
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:58,641
Hey!

318
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:15,729
- Pika?
- Hmm?

319
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:27,774
- Huh?
- Pika!

320
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,609
[Yelling]

321
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,512
Pika!

322
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,489
- Try and hit it.
- Pikachu!

323
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,485
Pika-pi!

324
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:49,353
- Pikachu!
- Pika-chu!

325
00:25:59,574 --> 00:26:01,565
[Shrilling]

326
00:26:08,116 --> 00:26:09,515
It's Latios.

327
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:12,144
[Angry shrilling]

328
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,553
- Why is he so mad at us?
- [Girl] What's going on here?

329
00:26:15,624 --> 00:26:17,455
What are you doing to Latios?

330
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:19,517
[Ash stammers]

331
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:22,961
- Well?
- Hold on a second.

332
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:26,364
We weren't doing anything.
We just followed this girl here.

333
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:28,925
- This is my friend, Pikachu.
- Pikachu!

334
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,598
And I'm Ash.
I'm a Pokémon trainer.

335
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,935
Really?

336
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,842
- Latios, get 'em.
- [Man] That's enough.

337
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:39,210
Bianca, Latios.

338
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,749
I'm sure this boy means no harm.

339
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:44,216
- Grandpa, they were...
- Hey, I know you.

340
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:46,277
But they...

341
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:50,290
It's okay. Latias, do you want
to play with your new friends?

342
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,724
Latias? Hey!

343
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:05,402
No offense, but I thought Latias
was the name of a Pokémon.

344
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:14,574
- [Yelling, moaning]
- [Shrilling]

345
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:16,913
Thanks. I'm okay. Thanks a lot.

346
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:19,715
- [Shrilling]
- [Laughing]

347
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:23,219
She must have really taken a liking
to this young man.

348
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:26,226
- Pika.
- [Shrilling]

349
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:28,228
- Pika!
- [Cooing]

350
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:34,098
- Pika? Pikachu!
- [Shrilling]

351
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:37,469
Pika!

352
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:39,530
[Shrilling]

353
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:41,599
Pika!

354
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:44,668
[Both shrilling]

355
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,077
Pika!

356
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,392
I'm Bianca. Sorry I almost
attacked you before, Ash.

357
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,893
That's okay.

358
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:02,088
I do have a few questions, though.

359
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:06,429
[Lorenzo] I suppose you're wondering why
Latias looked exactly like Bianca.

360
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:07,695
Yeah.

361
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,602
That's one of her powers.
She can take the shape of a human.

362
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:13,732
And since we're best friends,
she turns into me a lot.

363
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:20,640
- Pika! Pika!
- [Shrilling]

364
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:23,149
- Pika!
- Huh?

365
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:25,516
[Shrilling]

366
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:28,183
- [Laughing]
- Pika!

367
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:30,349
[Shrilling]

368
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:32,450
Hey, what are you doing?

369
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:35,185
Hey, come on!

370
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:37,231
That's my favorite hat.

371
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,062
[Trilling]

372
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,260
Got it.

373
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,209
[Shrilling]

374
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:26,912
- How is this happening?
- Don't be afraid, Ash.

375
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:30,178
Latios has the power to project
to us exactly what he's seeing.

376
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:32,811
- It's sight sharing.
- Sight sharing?

377
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,128
This is a rare privilege,
to see through the eyes of Latios.

378
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,099
I guess Latios thinks he can really
trust you and Pikachu.

379
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:03,983
Latias, this is amazing.
Tell Latios we say thanks.

380
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,451
Pika-pika!

381
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:22,667
[Ash] How long have you guys known
Latios and Latias?

382
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,331
[Bianca] Grandpa's known them
since they were babies.

383
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,433
[Lorenzo] Since their father
brought the water to our town.

384
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:33,106
He rescued the people from a life of terror
and left us this beautiful water city.

385
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:35,240
But I'm afraid it was too much for him.

386
00:30:35,316 --> 00:30:39,446
[Bianca] He used all his power to bring
the water, and then vanished into thin air.

387
00:30:39,521 --> 00:30:43,389
[Lorenzo] In his place, there was a
beautiful crystal orb called the Soul Dew,

388
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,892
said to contain the spirit of Latios.

389
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,896
So, Latios died saving the town,
and his children became orphans.

390
00:30:49,964 --> 00:30:52,762
- I'm afraid so, Ash.
- [Shrilling]

391
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:56,292
[Ash] Hey, this looks like the defense
mechanism that's in the museum.

392
00:30:56,371 --> 00:31:00,967
[Lorenzo] That diagram shows how
the Soul Dew is used to power it.

393
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,669
Where is the Soul Dew?

394
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:10,083
That's really cool.

395
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:15,420
I'll tell you something, Ash.

396
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,017
That beautiful jewel contains
not only the spirit of Latios,

397
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:23,826
but, in the wrong hands,
the power to destroy our town.

398
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:26,799
It must never leave this pool.

399
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:30,702
So, you see, it's important that
its location be kept a secret.

400
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:32,171
Right.

401
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,003
- [Shrilling]
- Hi, Latias.

402
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:37,670
- [Yelling]
- Pika.

403
00:31:37,745 --> 00:31:41,306
- Latias, hold on a second.
- Pika!

00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:43,213
[Yelling]

- [Trilling]
- [Laughing]

406
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,391
She wants to play some more.

407
00:31:56,464 --> 00:32:00,127
Sorry. I've got to go find my friends.

408
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:03,193
- But we'll play again real soon.
- Pika!

409
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:06,029
- Shall we head back then?
- Okay.

410
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:10,870
- Bye, you guys.
- Pikachu!

411
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,678
[Shrilling]

412
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:25,017
[Computerized beeping]

413
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:33,253
[Lorenzo] We can cut through here.

414
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:40,192
- Where are we?
- This is my workshop.

415
00:32:40,271 --> 00:32:42,796
- Grandpa makes gondolas here.
- Cool.

416
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:45,934
It's a job that keeps me
pretty busy in this town.

417
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:51,982
Bianca, why don't you take Ash
the rest of the way back to town?

418
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,483
Okay.

419
00:33:02,493 --> 00:33:05,894
Bianca, why were those two girls
chasing you before?

420
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:09,161
- Did you know 'em?
- What are you talking about?

421
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:11,133
It must have been Latias.

422
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:15,229
- Somebody was chasing Latias?
- Yeah. These two girls were.

423
00:33:15,306 --> 00:33:19,606
That's weird. Hmm.

424
00:33:38,796 --> 00:33:39,785
There they go.

425
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:42,526
All we got to do is follow 'em
over them rooftops.

426
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,659
I used to be quite a good gymnast.

427
00:33:44,736 --> 00:33:47,796
This is our big chance.
I can almost taste it.

428
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:49,669
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

429
00:33:56,614 --> 00:33:58,343
[Struggling]

430
00:33:58,416 --> 00:33:59,883
[Meowth] Hey, my foot! Ow!

- [Panting, gasping]
- [Jessie squeals]

432
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:12,587
That was a close one.

433
00:34:12,664 --> 00:34:14,825
- Wobbuffet!
- [All] Oof! Huh?

434
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:18,969
[All scream]

435
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,502
Team Rocket, blast...

[grunting]

437
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:33,906
Esp!

438
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:37,853
Hmm? Well, hello there.
Are you lost?

439
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:39,549
You don't look familiar.

440
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:41,683
- [Growling]
- Uhh!

441
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:45,258
[Groaning, thudding]

442
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:53,362
Bravo, Espeon.

- [Trilling]
- [Shrilling]

446
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:19,826
They must be in here somewhere.

447
00:35:19,897 --> 00:35:22,195
This is where the kid
was playing with them.

448
00:35:23,801 --> 00:35:24,597
[Shrilling]

449
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:28,036
We're in luck. It looks like now
they wanna play with us, Annie.

450
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:29,573
I know.

451
00:35:30,908 --> 00:35:32,773
First one to catch Latios wins.

452
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:35,005
[Angry shrilling]

453
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,641
Uh-oh. That's a new one.

454
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,914
These two are just full of surprises.

455
00:35:43,988 --> 00:35:46,456
Which, of course,
makes them even more desirable.

456
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:02,534
Right there.
Espeon, use your swift attack.

457
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,971
[Howling]

458
00:36:06,043 --> 00:36:07,943
These sunglasses rule.

459
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:11,843
It's Latias.
Ariados, use your nightshade.

460
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,577
Ari! Ari!

[Shrieking]

If you wanna be the hero,
we'll take you first.

463
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:34,437
Huh?

464

- Espeon, psybeam.

- Espeon, tackle attack.
- Espe! Espe!

468
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,857
Psychic attack, Espeon.

469
00:36:57,929 --> 00:36:59,726
Ariados, string shot.

471
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:12,336
Come on.

472
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:18,381
Going somewhere?

473
00:37:20,284 --> 00:37:22,752
[Shrilling]

474
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:35,863
At least we got one of them.

475
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:39,130
That may be all we need.

476
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:42,195
Especially if we have...

477
00:37:43,674 --> 00:37:45,505
[struggling]... this.

478
00:37:46,677 --> 00:37:49,339
[Straining] Stubborn little gem, isn't it?

479
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:52,678
- Just try not to break it.
- I don't think that's possible.

480
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:55,414
Got it.

481
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:57,477
[Laughing]

482
00:37:57,555 --> 00:38:00,615
Let me just take a look at this thing.

483
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:04,058
[Delighted gasping]

484
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:08,462
It's like it's... spiritual or something.

485
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:11,558
- You know what I mean, Oakley?
- I found it.

486
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,337
Well, technically, yes,
but it belongs to both of us.

487
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:18,398
That's not what I'm talking about.
Check this out.

488
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:19,636
What is it?

489
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,736
[Oakley] The etching in this stone
explains how the Soul Dew

490
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:25,077
is used to power the D.M.A.

491
00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:27,811
[Annie] Didn't we have that info
from the book we stole?

492
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:30,820
[Oakley] But this has a lot of stuff
the book didn't have.

493
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:33,015
[Annie] Like what?

494
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,820
[Oakley] Hold on a sec.
It's written in some kind of code.

495
00:38:35,893 --> 00:38:37,656
Are you gonna be able to crack it?

496
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:42,665
[Oakley] It says the defense mechanism
must only be used as a last resort.

497
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:45,998
It'll cause the water to recede
and destroy the Soul Dew.

498
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:50,006
[Annie] I don't care about the water,
but we can't destroy my beautiful jewel.

499
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:52,936
Our jewel.

500
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,478
- Be careful with it.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

501
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:57,480
They probably just made that stuff up

502
00:38:57,548 --> 00:39:00,847
so people wouldn't try to use
the defense mechanism against them.

503
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,058
[Bianca] Oh, no!

504
00:39:20,499 --> 00:39:22,831
You were right. It's gone.

505
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,733
Just as I suspected.

506
00:39:26,372 --> 00:39:29,307
We better get to the museum right away.

507
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:56,263
It's working.

508
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:58,235
- Cool.
- Yeah.

509
00:40:16,755 --> 00:40:18,916
Perfect.
Just like the book said.

510
00:40:18,991 --> 00:40:21,186
We only have one more thing to do.

511
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:30,891
- Just what do you think you're doing?
- I guess you're a light sleeper.

512
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,371
We can help you with that.
Espeon, psychic attack.

513
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:40,310
- [Growling]
- [Groaning]

514
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:42,108
[Thudding]

515
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:44,172
Sweet dreams.

516
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:46,114
Now, where were we?

517
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,131
Look at it go!

518
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:29,858
- [Light snoring]
- Pi?

519
00:41:29,928 --> 00:41:32,123
Pika.

520
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,029
Pika!

521
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:38,933
What's the matter, Pikachu?
Huh?

522
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,230
Bianca?

523
00:41:42,307 --> 00:41:43,934
Hey, what's up?

524
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,378
- [Misty and Brock] She's Latias?
- Right.

525
00:41:53,452 --> 00:41:56,114
Latias, I'd like for you
to meet my friends.

526
00:41:56,188 --> 00:41:57,485
This is Misty and Brock.

527
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:01,689
- Mm-hmm.
- Hi.

528
00:42:11,503 --> 00:42:15,564
- [Shrilling]
- [Gasping]

529
00:42:20,345 --> 00:42:25,476
Latios, you've got to open your eyes
so Latias can see what's happening to us.

530
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:28,179
[Bianca] Latios! Please!

531
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:45,993
This is the control seat.

532
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:48,266
It doesn't look very comfortable.

533
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,173
[Shrilling, yelping]

534
00:42:52,845 --> 00:42:54,039
Oh, no! Latios!

535
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,054
- It's happening.
- [Gasping]

536
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,822
How did we get in here?

537
00:43:06,892 --> 00:43:09,622
- What's going on, Ash?
- Sight sharing.

538
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,219
Sight sharing?

539
00:43:11,296 --> 00:43:14,595
We're seeing exactly
what Latios is seeing right now.

540
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:19,100
- Bianca and Lorenzo.
- Pikachu.

541
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,070
Somebody's stolen the Soul Dew.

542
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,848
Let's see what this baby's made of.

543
00:43:37,956 --> 00:43:40,789
First, we'll bring in some reinforcements.

544
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:44,158
Are you crazy?
You're going to destroy the entire city!

545
00:43:44,229 --> 00:43:48,290
Kabutops, Aerodactyl, rise!

546
00:43:59,111 --> 00:44:00,840
[Shrieking]

547
00:44:01,046 --> 00:44:02,775
Kabutops!

548
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,749
- It's the fossils.
- The evil fossils.

549
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:08,082
- Aerodactyl.
- And Kabutops.

550
00:44:08,153 --> 00:44:11,850
- How is this happening?
- Think about what you're doing.

551
00:44:11,924 --> 00:44:14,791
All right, you two,
bring me back that Latias.

552
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,058
- [Shrieking]
- Kabutops! Kabutops!

[Shrilling]

557
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,138
Ash, what is going on?

558
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,614
I think we're in trouble.

559
00:44:37,683 --> 00:44:40,174
- Everybody in this city is in trouble.
- Huh?

560
00:44:41,202 --> 00:44:44,137
I can control the whole world from in here!

561
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,265
Initiate citywide lockdown.

562
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,536
[Maniacal laughing]

563
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:54,980
- Let's get out of this place.
- Where did we leave the boat?

564
00:44:55,049 --> 00:44:56,983

- Hey!
- What's going on here?

568
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:12,530
- I had nothing to do with it!
- Mama!

569
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,692
It was their idea!

570
00:45:21,909 --> 00:45:24,707
That's right.
We don't want any intruders.

571
00:45:37,558 --> 00:45:40,118
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

No! Latias!

- Ash!
- Where's he going?

574
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:56,508
We'll be okay.
We're going to the museum.

575
00:45:56,577 --> 00:45:59,375
- We have to stop them.

can you guide me to the museum?

If Ash gets in trouble,
he's gonna need his Pokémon.

- Yeah!

633
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,182
- Thanks, you guys.
- Pika!

[Shrilling]

635
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:20,260
There she is.

636
00:50:20,337 --> 00:50:23,670
Not that kid again!

637
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:26,005
It's not too late
if you stop what you're doing.

638
00:50:26,076 --> 00:50:28,476
Just remove the jewel
and release Latios.

639
00:50:28,546 --> 00:50:29,604
Do it now!

640
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:32,906
Pops, I don't care if your town dries up.

641
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:36,747
With this machine, I have the power
to control the entire world if I want to.

642
00:50:36,821 --> 00:50:38,618
Oakley.

643
00:50:38,689 --> 00:50:41,089
All right, now to have some fun.

00:51:18,462 --> 00:51:19,554
Pika-pi!

648
00:51:24,535 --> 00:51:26,628
Not gonna get away this time.

[All shriek]

650
00:51:36,814 --> 00:51:40,272
- Pika!
- [Screaming]

651
00:51:41,952 --> 00:51:44,284
Now for the grand finale.

652
00:51:52,329 --> 00:51:55,856
I am really getting good at this.

653
00:51:55,933 --> 00:51:58,265
[Gagging]

654
00:52:12,116 --> 00:52:14,107

655
00:52:14,785 --> 00:52:17,015
- [Groaning]
- Pika!

656
00:52:17,087 --> 00:52:21,319
- [Shrilling]
- Latias!

657
00:52:23,193 --> 00:52:26,060
- Latias, are you okay?
- Pikachu!

658
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,495
[Shrilling]

659
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:29,054
We better get going.

660
00:52:30,301 --> 00:52:32,997
What is happening to my control panel?

661
00:52:33,637 --> 00:52:34,695
[Gasping]

662
00:52:39,143 --> 00:52:41,407

[Shrilling]

665
00:52:56,894 --> 00:52:58,759
Pikachu, thundershock them.

666
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:00,990
Pika-chu!

667
00:53:04,068 --> 00:53:06,730
- Are you guys all right?
- I think so.

668
00:53:06,804 --> 00:53:09,136
We must hurry.

669
00:53:09,206 --> 00:53:11,606
Pikachu, you got to help us out.

670
00:53:11,675 --> 00:53:13,506
Pika-chu!

671
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:20,510
What is happening to that thing?

672
00:53:20,584 --> 00:53:21,608

[Yelping]

676

We've got to turn it off
before it's too late.

677
00:53:38,469 --> 00:53:40,960
Oakley? Oakley!

678
00:53:42,272 --> 00:53:43,933
Annie!

679
00:53:47,144 --> 00:53:48,941

[Both shrilling]

681
00:53:54,952 --> 00:53:56,783
We have to save Latios.

682
00:53:56,854 --> 00:53:58,754
Pikachu, try a thundershock.

683
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:00,084
Pika-chu!

684

[Shrilling, pained yelping]

691
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:28,180
He's hurt badly.

[Shrilling]

693
00:54:39,129 --> 00:54:40,619
I've got to help them.

[All struggle, strain]

[Shrilling]

696
00:54:56,547 --> 00:55:01,143
That's weird. It just stopped.
I guess it was Latios.

697
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:05,985
[Shrilling]

698
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:08,889
[Trilling]

699
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:15,365
Latios. You're okay.

700
00:55:15,432 --> 00:55:15,522
Hmm.

701
00:55:15,522 --> 00:55:17,251
Hmm.

702
00:55:17,324 --> 00:55:18,655
Oh!

703
00:55:22,863 --> 00:55:26,424
Hey, Oakley, the party's over.
Come on. Wake up.

704
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:33,434
- [Groaning] What happened?
- I think you got a little in over your head.

705
00:55:35,342 --> 00:55:37,537
- [Brock] Ash!
- [Misty] Are you guys all right?

706
00:55:37,611 --> 00:55:40,341
Maybe I'll hold on
to that jewel from now on.

707
00:55:40,414 --> 00:55:42,109
How does that sound?

708
00:55:42,182 --> 00:55:44,878
- I think we should get out of here.
- Uh-huh.

709
00:55:47,955 --> 00:55:50,287
What happened to it?

710
00:55:50,357 --> 00:55:53,884
It's all black and weird-looking.
Check it out.

711
00:55:56,263 --> 00:55:58,390
- Don't touch that!
- Huh?

712
00:55:58,465 --> 00:56:01,798
[Screaming]

713
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:11,076
[Girls gasp, squeal]

714
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,108
What's happening?

715
00:56:18,185 --> 00:56:21,450
The prophecy was true.
The Soul Dew is dying.

716
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:24,183
It's been out of the pool
for much too long.

717
00:56:24,257 --> 00:56:26,623
- All the water is leaving.
- [All] Oh!

718
00:56:30,998 --> 00:56:32,056
Look at that!

719

[Shrieking]

720

[Gasping]

722
00:56:59,893 --> 00:57:01,952
[Ash] It's all gone.

723
00:57:02,029 --> 00:57:03,894
[Lorenzo] I'm afraid it's coming back.

724
00:57:03,964 --> 00:57:06,125
[Misty] What do you mean?

725
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:10,431
[Shrilling]

726
00:57:10,504 --> 00:57:12,335

[Shrilling]

734
00:57:59,019 --> 00:58:01,419
- Latias!
- Latios!

735
00:58:01,488 --> 00:58:02,682
Pikachu!

[Gasping]

743
00:59:59,706 --> 01:00:01,173
Where are they?

744
01:00:01,241 --> 01:00:03,835
- Look. The water.
- [All] Huh?

745
01:00:17,524 --> 01:00:20,220
- [All sigh]
- I'd kill for a hot bath right now.

746
01:00:20,293 --> 01:00:21,817
[Groaning]

747
01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:24,956
[All] Huh? Aah!

748
01:00:26,766 --> 01:00:29,064
This is not what I had in mind.

749

[Gasping, screaming]

750
01:00:30,904 --> 01:00:32,997

Huh?

755
01:01:04,604 --> 01:01:07,164
[Annie] You had to go for world domination.

756
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,334
It wasn't enough that we had
the most beautiful, valuable jewel

757
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:11,775
in the entire universe.

758
01:01:11,845 --> 01:01:13,540
You had to be a control freak.

759
01:01:13,613 --> 01:01:16,013
[Oakley] Don't knock it till you try it.

760
01:01:16,082 --> 01:01:21,019
Do you have any idea what it's like
having that kind of control over everything?

761
01:01:21,087 --> 01:01:23,419
[Annie] Too bad you didn't have
control over yourself.

762
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:26,982
- [Oakley] Like you did.
- What are you talking about?

763
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:30,552
The Soul Dew?
You tried to pick it up, remember?

764
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:34,361
Oh, yeah. Anyway, we should
probably go home now, right?

765
01:01:34,434 --> 01:01:35,924
I'd love to.

- [Oakley] No kidding.

768
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:43,667
[Annie] No, I mean, I'm not too good
with closed spaces.

769
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:46,303
[Oakley] You're not too good
with closing your mouth, either.

- Pika? Pika-pi!
- Huh? Oh!

774
01:02:10,715 --> 01:02:12,273
[Ash] It's Latias.

[Shrilling]

782
01:02:41,246 --> 01:02:44,443
So, that light is Latios?

783
01:02:49,654 --> 01:02:53,750
Like his father,
Latios gave his life to save the city.

784

[Shrilling]

785

- Sight sharing.

789
01:03:12,844 --> 01:03:14,277
[Bianca] That's right.

790
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,109
Latios, is this what you're seeing?
Show us.

791
01:03:37,769 --> 01:03:41,899
The earth is so pretty... so blue.

[Mournful shrilling]

795
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,905
- It's perfect. Just like the old one.
- Yeah.

796
01:04:51,976 --> 01:04:54,706
We now have a new guardian of Altomare.

Hmm?

01:05:39,624 --> 01:05:41,353
Thank you for everything.

803
01:05:41,426 --> 01:05:44,156

Hold on.

805
01:05:45,797 --> 01:05:48,994
Bianca was going to the market,
but she may still be here.

806
01:05:49,067 --> 01:05:53,333
[Lorenzo] Bianca!
Your friends are leaving!

807
01:05:53,404 --> 01:05:55,531
I'm afraid you just missed her.

808
01:05:55,606 --> 01:05:58,769
[Ash] Tell her we said thanks and goodbye.

Pika-pika!

814
01:06:10,154 --> 01:06:11,781
Huh?

815
01:06:14,325 --> 01:06:17,920
Bianca. Hey, driver, can you pull over?

816
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:34,139
Hey.

Bye.

822
01:06:56,234 --> 01:07:00,728
Wait a sec.
Was that Bianca or Latias?

823
01:07:00,805 --> 01:07:05,674
I don't know...
but I am extremely jealous!
