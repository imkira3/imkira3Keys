1
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:31,030
The sea is watching...

2
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:38,080
The beginning of the world...

3
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,320
The sea knows...

4
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,930
Of the end of the world...

5
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:59,180
So it shows...

6
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:06,250
The path to be followed...

7
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:12,660
So he guides us...

8
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:19,530
Towards a correct world...

9
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:34,980
Pain, suffering, he collects it all...

10
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:49,330
Big and gentle, he cuddles them all...

11
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,670
I will destroy
all pirates!

12
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,940
I'll just follow master Z.

13
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,520
Catch this!

14
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,490
I'll also follow master Z.

15
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,750
Smash Buster!

16
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,040
Smash Buster!

17
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,770
Retreat! Fall back!

18
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,340
Master Z...

19
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,210
How long has it been?
Master.

20
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,350
What brings you here?

21
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,020
Borsalino!

22
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,420
I've warned you not to depend too much on you're Pika Pika no Mi power.

23
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,430
You're still hard as rock,
like always.

24
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,460
Master Zephyr.

25
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,530
I abandoned that name.

26
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,970
I am Z!

27
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,380
Don't you think you're feeling
too sure of yourself

28
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,810
by becoming "Admiral Kizaru" of the Navy?!

29
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,250
I didn't come here to remember the past.

30
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,820
You won't be able to match my speed with that heavy weapon.

31
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,290
What will you use the
Dyna Rocks for?

32
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,730
Since ancient times,
I never got along with you!

33
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,470
Come, return the Dyna Rocks.

34
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,000
They say that the Dyna Rocks
rival the Ancient Weapons.

35
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,280
How about we use them
to celebrate our reunion?

36
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,790
Dyna Rocks cause a massive explosion
when exposed to oxygen.

37
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,420
Let's Go!

38
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,480
Master Z!

39
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,730
Damm!

40
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,630
What in the hell is the Navy doing?

41
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,020
Come on!

42
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,820
Come on, baby!

43
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,730
I'm always a
lively skeleton.

44
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,470
Come on!

45
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,870
It's good drinking while watching
the cherry blossoms.

46
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,270
Right, Chopper?

47
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,840
Yes! I love drinking milk
while watching the leaves as well!

48
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,180
Cherry... No, It's me!

49
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,820
Meat!

50
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,860
It stinks!
I smell poison!

51
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,570
It's a deadly poison!

52
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,070
What is it, Chopper?

53
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,900
He was poisoned?

54
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,610
Chopper!

55
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,540
He took poison...

56
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,140
I remembered!

57
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,080
Do you have any idea of what it is?

58
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,420
Listen to this song..."The poison I took".

59
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,750
It's a song?!

60
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,290
Now that I think about it,
the taste of the drink is...

61
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,760
Wait, or was it
always like this?

62
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,640
They are always so lively.

63
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,570
Plant care,
taking care of plants.

64
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,280
Come on, my children!
I want you to give birth to a lot of Pop Greens!

65
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,780
The worms exterminator,
the great Usopp, shall protect them!

66
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,950
Usopp!

67
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,760
So it's your fault!

68
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,590
Look! Usopp was
caught by the poisonous milk!

69
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,790
It's your fault
for being there!

70
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,600
The poison is
for killing worms!

71
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,200
If you die, it means you are worms!

72
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,770
Well, then we can relax.
After all, we are not insects.

73
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,480
So, are you ok?

74
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,950
The taste is a bit different,
but it's also pretty good.

75
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,050
It's a little bitter...
is it because I'm becoming an adult?

76
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,350
Let me try it.

77
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,490
That's horrible!

78
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,730
Agricultural chemicals
also affect the human body.

79
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,200
I am the cherry tree...
I'm slowly spreading...

80
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,810
Luffy, the cherry tree!
The autumn will end.

81
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,780
Wait a bit more, cherry!
Lets go!

82
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,110
It's south... I'm going south!

83
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,710
Change of course!

84
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,550
Damn you, why
did you spilled my drink?

85
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,220
Frankly, they make so much noise...

86
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,450
Why can't you rest quietly?

87
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,220
Hey, be quiet! Damn it.

88
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,630
Nami!

89
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,630
Delivery of the special orange juice!

90
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,400
Thank you, Sanji.

91
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,030
I'd also love some dessert!

92
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,170
Nami! Yes,
with pleasure!

93
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,870
Hey, Sanji!

94
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,340
I also want dessert! And meat!

95
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,910
I want some candies!

96
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,050
Me too!

97
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,580
I want cola!

98
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,420
My drink is ending!

99
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,220
I want dessert too!

100
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,220
Shut up, bastards!

101
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,220
When you ask something to someone,
it has to be politely, you idiots!

102
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,630
I was born only
for the ladies!

103
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,070
It taste bad!

104
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,840
Hey, Usopp, your poison is here again.

105
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,880
I'm not using it anymore!

106
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,540
What is this?

107
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,780
It's snow!

108
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,220
No, its not freezing to be snow.

109
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,450
What is it?

110
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,320
This is... volcanic ashes!

111
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,990
Volcanic ashes?!

112
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,730
That's disgusting!

113
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,930
The ashes entered
your fur, did it not?

114
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,670
Let's take a bath together after.

115
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,530
-Bath?
-Together?!

116
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,530
Today
is not my bath day...

117
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,840
But I'll take it,
this is very disgusting.

118
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,140
Me... Can I take a bath
with you as well?

119
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,680
Can I?

120
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,950
Look, my face
is also disgusting!

121
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,960
Don't hurt your
feelings by what you said.

122
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,660
No...

123
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Brooke, you can
take a bath with me!

124
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,300
I love you, Chopper!

125
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,940
Hey, Nami!
Do you have any idea?

126
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,140
The needle that pointed to the direction that came the volcanic ashes

127
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,140
began rotating randomly.

128
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,680
It is a strange movement.

129
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,850
It looks like a lost child
who lost their parents.

130
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,720
Lost?
How so?

131
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,620
For example, the volcanic eruption that released those ashes,

132
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,490
could've exploded the entire island.

133
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,930
And because of that
the needle stopped pointing?

134
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,930
That's impossible!

135
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,700
This is the New World!?

136
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,900
That's right, you bastard.
Don't be surprised.

137
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,970
Disappear before the beauty of Nami.
You cherry shit.

138
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,540
Nami, some tea.

139
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,610
Thank you.

140
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,880
Anyway, we have to avoid at all cost, the island the needle was pointing at.

141
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,950
In that case, Nami...

142
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,560
There is someone we can't
show that pointer by any means.

143
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,890
That's true.

144
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,690
Choosing the safest route

145
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,830
and guarantee the
crew life is my job.

146
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,430
Hey, that needle is
moving very interestingly!

147
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,870
Luffy!?

148
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,270
Let's go there!

149
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,240
Crap!
He saw it!

150
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,210
I smell adventure!

151
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:06,980
Wait, Luffy! You didn't listed correctly!
According to Nami, those ashes were...

152
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,250
Hey, guys!
Our route has been decided!

153
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,680
Get ready!

154
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,050
Luffy!...

155
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,330
But...

156
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,100
If the pointer is crazy,
how will we know where the island is...

157
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,530
Be quiet.

158
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,730
I'm a navigator.

159
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,600
If we decide to go,
I can take you anywhere.

160
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,670
Luffy, keep an eye out.

161
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,110
Leave it to me!

162
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,740
Hey, is it really alright
choosing it like this?

163
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,680
In the New World, the path you
choose can cost us our lives.

164
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,050
Franky,
Turn 20 degrees to port.

165
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,720
Turning 20 degrees
to port.

166
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,160
Hey, do you hear me?

167
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,330
We don't know what might happen,
so prepare yourselves!

168
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,830
We can't do anything.

169
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,100
After all, he is the captain.

170
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,850
But we don't want to get
involved with volcanoes

171
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,850
or anything that can
threaten our lives!

172
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,620
Castaway located.

173
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,420
Prepare to rescue him immediately!

174
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,030
He's being dragged!

175
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,600
Leave it to me!

176
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,740
Luffy, whats wrong?

177
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,810
I'm running out of strength...

178
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,350
Pull, pull!

179
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,150
Luffy, don't let go yet!

180
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,790
Luffy, are you ok?

181
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,730
So? Is he alive?

182
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:09,700
His heart rate and breathing are weak, but he's only passed out, he's not in danger.

183
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
Really?

184
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,140
I hope we didn't get someone
problematic again.

185
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,540
A big guy all bruised!

186
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,210
And this business in his left arm...

187
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,180
Just by looking, anyone
can tell its not just something.

188
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,720
Thats really made of Kairouseki.

189
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,220
I get it! Thats why Luffy lost his
strength when he touched it.

190
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,560
A powerful weapon
made of Kairouseki...

191
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,700
Awesome!

192
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,030
Thats not it!

193
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,900
Kairouseki has the same
energy as the ocean.

194
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,510
A weapon made from that material...

195
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,110
means that it was made
to end Devil Fruit users.

196
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,880
He might be an enemy.

197
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,250
and we can't lower our
guard in the New World.

198
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,660
If you're worried, throw him overboard.

199
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,060
Idiot!
We can't do that.

200
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,330
I don't want to!

201
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,560
He might kill you as
soon as you heal him.

202
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,070
Even so, I'm a doctor!
I can't abandon him.

203
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,140
Whats the problem?

204
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,010
Heal him, Chopper.

205
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,580
If he's the
enemy, I'll finish him off.

206
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,810
Is that alright?

207
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,880
Yes! Thank you, Luffy!

208
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,750
Well, as a see warrior,
of course it's alright.

209
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,220
Damn, they are so carefree.

210
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,430
I really have a bad
feeling about this...

211
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,360
It's exciting, right?

212
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,130
There is no need for
that kind of excitement.

213
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,680
Luffy, it looks like he woke up!

214
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,850
Yes, it seems so.

215
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,120
Hey, crappy cooker.

216
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,650
Shut your mouth.

217
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,650
I know, you shit marimo.

218
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,790
Got that?
We caught a big fish.

219
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,490
Are you ok?

220
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,160
You don't need to force yourself.

221
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,700
You were floating in the see,
do you remember it?

222
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,470
Yes, I remember.

223
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,770
Thank you for the great treatment.

224
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,840
It looks like I came back
to life, doctor...?

225
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,880
Chopper!

226
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,850
Doctor Chopper.
You are a great medic.

227
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,950
Praising me doesn't
get me happy, you idiot!

228
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,820
You are the captain of this ship?

229
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,090
Can you tell?

230
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,460
Yes I can.

231
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,800
I've seen a lot of
young man like you.

232
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,900
I'm a specialist when it comes to
understanding your powers.

233
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,930
Really?

234
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,340
What will you do? Stay with us until we arrive to the next island?

235
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,740
I got a Vivre Card, my friends should be using that to get here.

236
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,280
Old man...

237
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,450
thats a cool weapon!

238
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,250
Where do they sell those?

239
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:17,690
When I lost my arm to a damn pirate, a crazy scientist from the Navy made this one for me.

240
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,630
Battle Smasher.

241
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,230
It's made of Kairouseki,
the weakness of the Devil Fruit users

242
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:29,270
this way I destroy their power and crush them with this powerful squeeze.

243
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,240
Dr. Chopper, I don't
recommend something heavy like this.

244
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,680
Awesome!

245
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,940
I can't get it off without a special key, so something terrible can happen

246
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,450
if I fall with it
on the ocean.

247
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,350
Old man, are you a Marine?

248
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,420
No. I got too old for that, so I left them.

249
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,720
I'm doing something different now.

250
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,090
What are you doing?

251
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,890
I'm fighting for the
mission I gave myself.

252
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,630
What are you fighting against?

253
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,800
It looks like I'm being questioned.

254
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm sorry about that.

255
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,940
It's just that it would be
bad for us if you were a Marine.

256
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,140
Would there be a
problem if I were a Marine?

257
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,640
Yes. After all, we are pirates.

258
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,350
Really?
You are pirates.

259
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,160
Luffy!

260
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,630
Nami, go outside!

261
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,490
Take care of it, please.

262
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,760
How painful... a punch from a
Kairouseki weapon really works.

263
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,800
Straw Hat...

264
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,100
Why are you a pirate?

265
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,210
To become the Pirate King!

266
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,210
Pirate King...

267
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,120
Pirate King?!

268
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,500
He's strong!

269
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,010
Damn!

270
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,010
Brooke! Let's fight too!

271
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,050
Ok!

272
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,150
They're here?

273
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,460
I am a Vice-Admiral of the New Navy, Ain!

274
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,370
We are confiscating
this pirate ship.

275
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,270
Do not resist.
You will only shorten your lives.

276
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:52,410
There is no pirate that doesn't
resist when he's asked not to!

277
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,950
Even we started to attack!

278
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,430
Mosa Mosa!

279
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,670
What the hell is this?

280
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,930
-Thats is...
-A Devil Fruit user!

281
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,300
Mosa Mosa no Mi ability...

282
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,940
Mosa Mosa Dance can control
every plant there is!

283
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,790
Things look dangerous out there as well.

284
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,320
Let's end this now!

285
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,620
Dos Fleur!

286
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,490
What...

287
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,630
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa!

288
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,300
He's so fast that I
can't establish a target!

289
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,940
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa Mosa!

290
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,940
Can't breathe...

291
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,840
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa!

292
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
Be careful!

293
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,950
Don't come down!

294
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,150
Mosa Mosa!

295
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,020
What is this?...

296
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,150
-Stop it!!

297
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,150
Mosa Mosa Mosa!

298
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,660
No!  No!  No!

299
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,360
Gust Sword!

300
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,700
Modo Modo!

301
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,300
Nami!

302
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,780
How dare you do that with Nami?!

303
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,550
Heavy Point!

304
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,680
Modo Modo!

305
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,950
Chopper!

306
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:50,400
No! Stop...
Don't come close...

307
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,960
No!
No! No!

308
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,600
Brooke!

309
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Stop!!

310
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,240
Seis Fleur!

311
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,210
You are also a
Devil Fruit user, right?

312
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,410
What have you done with
Nami and Chopper?

313
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,150
Robin! Stop using
your ability!

314
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,680
Modo Modo!

315
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,590
I ate the Mono Mono no Mi.
I am a regressive person.

316
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,430
My ability can transform
anything 12 years in time.

317
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,840
Now you should be about 18 years old.

318
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,100
I'm so tiny!

319
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,480
If I touch you two more times, you will regress 12 years two times, in other words, 24 years,

320
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,150
Making your
existence disappear.

321
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,950
Smash Buster!

322
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,400
Mosa Mosa!

323
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,810
You'll become the
Pirate King with that power alone?

324
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,640
Don't make me laugh.

325
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,420
Should I crush you like this?

326
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,350
What do you think, Pirate King?

327
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,590
What's you're name?

328
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,030
Monkey D. Luffy.

329
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,700
I get it.
You're Garp grandson.

330
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,600
Master Z,
I'm happy you're alright.

331
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,010
We're destroying this pirate ship
with a simultaneous attack from out fleet.

332
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,580
Luffy!

333
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,310
Are you ok, Luffy?

334
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,650
I am the Commander
of the New Navy, Z!

335
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,230
I will obliterate every
single pirate!

336
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,830
Try to survive while you still can.

337
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,900
Pirates!

338
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,800
Damn!

339
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,540
Wait!...

340
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:20,180
Our fight...
Our fight isn't over yet!

341
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,990
Sunny!...

342
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,560
Damn!

343
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,860
Chopper, take that off!
We're really in danger!

344
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,700
Luffy!

345
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,670
Luffy, let's run!

346
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,710
Franky, let's retreat!

347
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,350
Come on! Damn!

348
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,620
I'm free! Super!...

349
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:12,270
Come on, Sunny! I believe in you!

350
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,100
Emergency escape system!

351
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,210
Coup D'Burst!

352
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,770
They really did that.

353
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:59,280
Originally, they are our trump card to protect the Final Points of the pirates.

354
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,850
Using the Dyna Rocks to
destroy the Final Points...

355
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:11,690
The first Final Point sank
with the base that protected them.

356
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,200
Z objective is to destroy
the three Final Points...

357
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,830
...and destroy the
sea of the New World.

358
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:27,010
Even that man would get injured if he was caught in the Dyna Rocks explosion.

359
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,310
He's alive.

360
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:37,620
Everyone here must know this.
He doesn't know when to fall.

361
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,020
Z....

362
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,320
Or rather, former
Admiral of the Navy, Black Fist Zephyr

363
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,830
He is alive.

364
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,730
Either way, we have to recover the Dyna Rocks, no matter the cost.

365
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,030
He may have taken
care of us in the past...

366
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,970
...but now he is our enemy,
enemy of justice.

367
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,870
And everyone who's
part of the New Navy...

368
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,510
...even if Z is alive.

369
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,650
They all should be disposed of...

370
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,680
...in the name of justice.

371
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:16,160
Hunt Z and his New Navy
with all the power of the Navy!

372
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:21,060
Let's recover the Dyna Rocks
and execute absolute justice!

373
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,570
If the Final Points were destroyed, the world would be as well.

374
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,410
Is that really a lie?

375
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,540
You think that if it was a lie we
would take this so seriously?

376
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,910
I understand what Z is planing.

377
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,180
He wants to end with all the
pirates of the New World.

378
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,020
If he uses the Final Points,
that becomes possible.

379
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:56,060
But of course, he won't destroy only the pirates, he'll kill all the innocent citizens as well.

380
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,530
Vice-Admiral Garp...
Who is this Z?

381
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,110
A man who was our comrade once.

382
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,710
We were friends.

383
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,050
We should have been comrades.

384
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:23,860
Zephyr... your anger is
so strong to destroy the world?

385
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,560
Do you hate
us that much?

386
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,790
Luffy!

387
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,190
I'm going to
completely fix Sunny!

388
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:01,390
It will take some time, but while
I fix it you'll go after Z, right?

389
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,560
Yes, I'm leaving Sunny with you!

390
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,140
This is for the doctor.
This if for the load...

391
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,440
I'm so sorry...

392
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:14,810
All of this because I
wanted to save that Z.

393
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,040
Don't apologize.

394
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,880
A pirate shouldn't regret
doing what he believed in.

395
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,880
It's not your fault.
We all know that.

396
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,390
Thank you.

397
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,030
New Navy...
Who could that Z be?

398
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,330
When he found out we were pirated, e attacked out of nowhere!

399
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,270
The ability of that
Binz is problematic.

400
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,170
Next time we are going
to settle things straight.

401
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,080
Besides, we need to avenge Sunny, that showed so much bravery.

402
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,280
If it wasn't for Sunny strength,

403
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,850
we would all be swimming at sea because of the Navy attack.

404
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,650
We need to find that New Navy
and pay them back.

405
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,250
Are you serious?!

406
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,760
I don't want to mess with
those dangerous people again.

407
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,430
Let's just stay in this island
until Sunny is repaired!

408
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,030
What are you talking about?

409
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:14,470
If we don't find them,
my body won't return to normal!

410
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,940
Me neither!

411
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,640
I don't want to stay like this!

412
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,840
With this body of a child,
I can't do anything!

413
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,580
The navigation in the New World
will be a lot harder!

414
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:32,090
As navigator, I need to get back to normal, so I can guide Sunny Go!

415
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,750
That's right!

416
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,360
I didn't said for you to
continue like this.

417
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,290
It would be a problem if
I didn't return to normal as well.

418
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,300
I bet you're happy to be 18 again and having everything in the right place again.

419
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,840
I'm sorry!

420
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:55,370
Honestly. Don't joke around
when our ladies are in trouble.

421
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,980
But, wait a second...

422
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:07,550
That means I'll be able to closely follow Nami's precious days while her body matures?

423
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,890
I'll be able to see the moment when the larva turns into a beautiful butterfly?!

424
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,330
That's incredibly awesome!

425
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,860
Disgusting.

426
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,200
Hu? I'm going to kill you,
you marimo!

427
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,540
If you went back into a kid,
I'd give you a lesson.

428
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,610
Idiot!...

429
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,570
I'd defeat you even as a kid!

430
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,610
What did you say?

431
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:33,480
Then I would defeat you even
younger, with 3 year old!

432
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,510
Idiot!...

433
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,380
And I would have defeated
you when I was a baby!

434
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,350
-Hu?!
-What did you say?!

435
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,990
This is no time to fight!

436
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
You know...

437
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:50,760
Actually, my
age was also decreased...

438
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,470
It looks like...

439
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,470
It didn't change...

440
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,970
Anything...

441
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:59,010
I was also touched by
that Ain from the New Navy.

442
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,710
Speaking about it, it's true.

443
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,080
But it didn't change anything...

444
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,710
No! Brooke,
dead and only bones.

445
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,280
I've been a
corpse for more than 50 years...

446
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,420
But something changed
that had never happened before.

447
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,520
My age went back 12 years.

448
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,360
Look, my hair has the
softness of 12 years ago!

449
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,760
No it hasn't!
You painted your hair!

450
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,430
Then were you
happy to rejuvenate?

451
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,400
You don't need to
go back?

452
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,410
Yes, that's right.

453
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:38,710
No, No! I also want...
to return to normal?

454
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,780
How do I know?!

455
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:48,390
For us to go back to normal, we have to gather information about Z and the New Navy.

456
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,460
Do you need
something, old man?

457
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,460
If it's the price of consulting
the doctor, talk to our navigator.

458
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,730
Did Z showed up again?

459
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,870
Old man,
do you know Z?

460
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:09,640
Many pirate ships have been attacked around here and comes to these docks.

461
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:16,020
All the injured pirates
say they were attacked by Z.

462
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,020
Grandpa told me that when when costumers come to the docks,

463
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,590
they are all pirates
saying they were attacked by Z.

464
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,330
They come to fix their ships
and they use the docks,

465
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:34,200
We receive the ships that
were totally destroyed by the navy.

466
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:41,140
My grandpa was a sailor, so he takes care of the pirates or anyone that comes with a problem.

467
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:48,310
I only like people that risks their lives here in the New World, searching for their dreams.

468
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:57,590
Many were totally defeated by Z, lost their way and abandoned the New World.

469
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,360
Z is stealing the men
freedom on the sea.

470
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,600
Even if staying by their side
is wrong, I won't accept that.

471
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,240
If you were defeated by Z and
even so you want to face him,

472
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,910
I'd like to give you my
strongest equipment I have stored.

473
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,550
Strongest equipment?

474
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,550
Amazing! A powerful equipment!

475
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,820
Wait a second!

476
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,750
What, Nami? He said the
strongest! The strongest!

477
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,260
Before that,
we have to pursue Z!

478
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:34,360
And with Z attacks, our
clothes were all burned,

479
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,060
So we have to take care of that first.

480
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,370
If we stay the whole
time with these cherry fantasies,

481
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,200
we're going to raise suspicion when we are looking for information about him.

482
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,270
First we have to gather
information and clothes!

483
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,540
The strongest equipment
to defeat Z comes after that!

484
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,210
Got it.

485
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,550
Nami is small, but she's
the boss of it all, right?

486
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:59,950
Excuse me, do you have any big city on this island where we can get some information and clothes?

487
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,760
This island has nothing
besides our docks.

488
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,360
How about you go to
the neighboring island?

489
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:11,460
They are very popular
for the hot springs and volcanoes.

490
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,600
And now there is the sea train passing there, it has a lot of people visiting!

491
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,070
Sea train? Are you talking
about that sea train?

492
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,210
Yes.

493
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,200
That's right.
Luffy, Marino, Bones.

494
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,810
You guys are very strange. Leave it to us that we'll gather the information.

495
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,640
Isn't that right, Nami-swan,
Robin-chwan?

496
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,440
You're strange too, Sanji.

497
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,850
A lover face also won't do.

498
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,820
We will gather
the information!

499
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,520
No... But I wanted to go with you...

500
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,530
Let's enjoy the hot springs.
How about we rest before the battle?

501
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,860
Leave the new clothes to
me, I'll take care of them.

502
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,370
Looks like there is some
great brands on this island.

503
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,440
Okay, we're here!

504
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,640
Guys, don't get yourselves
caught by the Navy!

505
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,110
Spread out!

506
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,320
Honestly... Devil Fruit users
are full of weak points!

507
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,030
They lose their
strength even with that?

508
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,800
If we don't get the
upper part wet, we will still survive.

509
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,440
That's nice.

510
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,840
Can we really stay
here wasting our time?

511
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,680
Thats right! I want to beat him up, that Z!

512
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,110
You Idiot!

513
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:13,020
If a delinquent like you starts walking though out this island full of Marines,

514
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,590
it will cause us trouble again.

515
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:19,890
Nami told us already, right?

516
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:24,360
That we're letting them and Chopper gather information about Z?

517
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:43,050
Good, right?
A beautiful dancer!....

518
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,620
Everyone is so excited!

519
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,960
I'm happy you
liked it, sir.

520
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,430
Are you going on a date now, sir?

521
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,230
Yes. Leave it shining, please!

522
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:01,730
I can feel it...
I can feel it in my bones...

523
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,600
Everything goes away
along with the exhaustion.

524
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,370
Z....

525
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:12,910
I got distracted with the weapon in his arm and I let my guard down.

526
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:17,580
Since you're a Devil Fruit user, and you attack him without thinking...

527
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:22,460
and get caught by that Kairouseki arm again, you'll lose all your strength.

528
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,430
Let me and
Marimo take care of Z.

529
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,630
I don't want you to do anything.

530
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,760
I will finish him off.

531
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,000
Next time, I'll dodge that arm of his and attack him with everything I got!

532
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,740
You're lively as always.

533
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:42,940
I got tired of waiting
for you guys here.

534
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,590
Aokiji!

535
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:58,290
What's wrong, guys?
Who is this person?

536
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:02,100
A Marine! Admiral Aokiji of the Navy!

537
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,130
Admiral?!

538
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,830
Hi there. How long has it been?

539
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:16,880
We've finished
positioning the Dyna Rocks.

540
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,940
Understood.

541
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,750
When this volcano erupts,

542
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:29,220
those Navy brats...

543
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:34,560
Will know of my rage and
the scale of my hatred.

544
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,160
-Zoro, Sanji!

545
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:38,930
-Yes!

546
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:42,300
What does an Admiral
want with me?

547
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,770
Calm down, don't get too excited.

548
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,140
What do you want with us?

549
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,380
Don't tell me...

550
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,550
It's nothing like that.

551
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,250
I don't want to
capture you now.

552
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:01,320
I left the Navy, you should've known that.

553
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,920
I'm not a Navy Admiral anymore.

554
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,660
Then what are you?

555
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:12,200
What? I don't like a skeleton asking me that...

556
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:15,130
But since I'm not an Admiral anymore...

557
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,470
Am I an ally of justice?

558
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:19,340
No, that's not it...

559
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,440
What am I?

560
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,540
How should I know?

561
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:29,780
How will we know?! Well, that's it. I have no intention of fighting with you now.

562
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:37,390
Think about it. If I wished to fight, I wouldn't be in a hot spring where I can't use my powers.

563
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,990
You were waiting for us?

564
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:42,030
That's right.

565
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,900
I don't want
to stay here anymore...

566
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,340
So, let's talk
about the rest outside.

567
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,220
Ah, this?...

568
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:07,650
Well, how can I say,
I got carried away too much.

569
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,870
Chopper, have you found anything?

570
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:26,210
I heard some rumors that a few Marines came to this island after Z.

571
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,910
But I couldn't get
anything more.

572
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,210
Only rumors, hu?

573
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,210
In the store I'm at,
really has more Marines arriving...

574
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:38,280
...but I don't know
if it's because of Z...

575
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,620
...or due to Robin's popularity.

576
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,760
Robin is that
much popular?

577
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,960
Just look at how much I got for being her manager!

578
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,530
Awesome!

579
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,670
We can't do
anything with rumors alone.

580
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,570
So, what will we do?

581
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,940
I know! Leave it to me.

582
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,980
What happened to you leg?

583
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:11,250
Have you ever heard that in the world, there are things that it's best not to ask?

584
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,250
Then I won't ask...

585
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:17,260
Bu the way, why did
you fought against Akainu?

586
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,490
Aren't you both friends?

587
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:23,960
Well, well. You're really a
brat without any consideration..

588
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:27,630
No comments about that too.

589
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,940
Then, why are you here?

590
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,040
You really don't learn anything.

591
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,780
Well, that I can answer you.

592
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,380
Enjoying the hot springs.

593
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,050
That's what I'd like to say...

594
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:44,480
But actually,
I can't stay relaxing too much.

595
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:48,120
I'm chasing after a certain man.

596
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,560
You guys fought
against a strong guy, right?

597
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,060
Z...

598
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,560
That old man was strong, wasn't he?

599
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:01,500
After all, he is a former
Navy Admiral.

600
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,870
Sorry for the wait.

601
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:05,910
Thank you.

602
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:08,870
Young lady, you are
very small, but you strive a lot.

603
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:14,050
Mr. Marine, don't you
have any cool story to tell me?

604
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,050
You know Z?

605
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,120
Young lady,
how do you know Z?

606
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,860
Everyone knows him!

607
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:25,960
The adults are talking...
That you've come here to capture Z!

608
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:32,470
Ah, the rumors are
already saying that?

609
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:33,600
Ah, hey!

610
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,200
What's the problem?

611
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,470
So, Z is really
in this island?

612
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:42,510
That's right. We've come here
to take the bad guy Z.

613
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:44,310
We are heroes of justice!

614
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,910
So, what is Z objective?

615
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:49,750
What is he doing
here on this island?

616
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,050
That's enough.

617
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,820
To destroy the End Point.

618
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:55,690
End Point?...

619
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,660
Is that a lie just to scare me?

620
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,930
It so happens
that it's not a lie...

621
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:04,330
That's enough!

622
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:10,570
You guys drank too much already.
You're talking too much.

623
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,140
We're truly sorry, sir!

624
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,110
And you've got a lot
of interest in Z, young lady.

625
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16,840
Is there any objective behind that?

626
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:21,810
No! That man
asked me to ask about Z!

627
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:22,750
Crap!

628
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:24,580
It really is a strange man.

629
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,320
Nami threw
the blame on us!

630
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,620
Should we run for it?

631
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:34,190
It's really a shame, but it's enough disguising myself as a manager.

632
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:36,500
I have got to work.

633
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,830
Would you come with
me, young lady?

634
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,540
Let me go!

635
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,340
Seis Fleur!

636
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,610
-Let's run away!
-Yes.

637
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:57,120
-Captain!
-Are you alright?

638
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:59,990
That's the power of
the Hana Hana no Mi!

639
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:03,490
That woman is Nico Robin
of the Straw Hat pirates!

640
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:05,830
Don't let her escape!

641
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:06,860
Yes, sir!

642
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,430
The world is in the
Great Era of the pirates.

643
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,440
At sea, arise and vanish pirates
that go after the One Piece.

644
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,040
When some disappear, other are born.

645
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:25,640
Does pirates appear because the One Piece is on the other side of the sea of the New World?

646
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,250
Or does One Piece exists
because Pirates also exist?

647
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,450
Do dreams come first?
Or is it the people?

648
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,460
In some moments,...

649
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:42,160
when pirates choose their dreams, they loose their happiness and the loved ones cry for them.

650
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,160
What must be done?

651
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,300
Is there an answer?

652
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:53,970
The former Navy Admiral,
Z, found an answer by force.

653
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,910
If the One Piece
disappears, so will the pirates.

654
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,450
It's a very simple way of thinking, is it not?

655
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:08,590
I left the Navy, but I want to see where does the bath that Z has chosen will take him.

656
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:13,460
But I don't
know what to do next.

657
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,200
Straw Hat Luffy.

658
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:24,870
You'll follow your conviction
and face Z again, right?

659
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:28,640
Show me your
answer.

660
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,140
See you later.

661
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,810
Z is on this island.

662
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:43,790
Even so well disguised, in the end, we ended up creating a huge conflict!

663
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,290
But we got the information we needed!

664
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:50,660
Z is on this island!
Despite not knowing what he plans.

665
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,800
There they are!

666
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:54,730
Go on ahead!

667
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:58,900
Hissatsu! Midori Bosshi, Devil!

668
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,380
That's it!

669
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,650
Let's regroup with Luffy and the others?

670
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:07,680
Yes!

671
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,150
What do you think about
the clothes I got you?

672
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:14,120
It combines a lot, doesn't it?
With me, I mean.

673
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,890
-With you?!

674
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:17,660
I have a great taste.

675
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,190
Shut up...

676
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,230
Try to survive while you
still can, Pirates!

677
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,400
Luffy, Luffy!

678
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,400
Usopp and the other arrived.

679
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,510
And they brought a lot of friends along.

680
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:38,440
In the end, they caused a mess.

681
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,110
If so, we should have ...

682
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:46,520
Hey, Luffy! Let's ask them where Z is,
leave a few unharmed!

683
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,760
Luffy, take care of them...

684
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,060
Please.

685
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,540
That's...

686
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,950
Haoushoku no Haki...

687
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,980
Hey! Where is Z?

688
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,650
On the other side of the island.

689
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:23,890
My squad should be
chasing him now.

690
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,550
Tekkai!

691
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:03,100
Your justice is useless.

692
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,600
Justice, freedom...

693
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,740
You'll have to start
everything all over again.

694
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:37,800
It looks like the
Dyna Rocks worked on this island.

695
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,700
With that, the destruction of the
second End Point was a success.

696
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:49,610
Grande Imbuto.

697
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,780
We'll achieve that goal when
the third End Point is destroyed.

698
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,750
The pirates will vanish from the sea,

699
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:03,200
and the world will see
once more, a beautiful dawn.

700
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,960
Gomu Gomu no...

701
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,200
Rifle!

702
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,930
What are you doing here?

703
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,400
You pirate brats......!

704
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,200
Who are you calling a brat?

705
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,010
If you keep talking,
I'll kill you, old geezer!

706
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:26,080
Old man! Return
my friends back to normal!

707
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,950
Ain, Binz!

708
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:28,980
Yes!

709
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:30,710
Understood.

710
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:34,050
I'll take care of the swordsman.

711
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:37,090
Damn Marimo!
Going ahead like that...

712
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:40,860
Right! I don't even need
to fight! Go on, guys!

713
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:45,200
Mosa!

714
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,800
Mosa, Mosa, Mosa!

715
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,610
When a pirate wants something,
they take it by force, right?

716
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:01,510
If you want to return your friends to normal, come and get it the pirate way!

717
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:03,880
Damn! We've got not choice.

718
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,950
Usopp!

719
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,220
I'm going to
fight Z one on one.

720
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,020
Luffy!

721
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:15,200
Z...!

722
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,930
Help me!

723
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,900
We won't be able to run away!

724
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,530
Someone help us!

725
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,200
Stop right there.

726
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,920
Ladies, go to
the sea train and be careful.

727
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,150
Thank you very much!

728
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,570
Doesn't he care
about anyone?

729
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:32,840
Isn't this too much craziness?

730
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,640
This time you wont
catch me with that weapon!

731
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:45,380
You accelerated the flow of your blood.

732
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:49,210
To increase the skills
of your body over the limit?

733
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:51,590
Gear Second!

734
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,070
You said you'd become the Pirate King, Right?

735
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:13,810
Yes! I'll find the One Piece
and become the Pirate King!

736
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:15,080
I get it now...

737
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,410
But do you have determination?

738
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:22,550
Are you determined
to risk your own life?

739
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:23,490
I am!

740
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:26,120
But what about your
friends?!

741
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:43,510
Are you prepared to sacrifice your friends in order to fulfill your objective

742
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:47,340
and walk on top of
their corpses to continue?

743
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:00,020
Hurry up! Their not here yet?

744
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:04,360
If we wait too long, we'll
also be caught by the volcano!

745
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:10,000
Are they...

746
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,200
...alright?

747
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:15,670
Modo, Modo!

748
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:17,710
That's enough!

749
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:22,350
If we find each other
again, I'll kill you next time.

750
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,220
Time's up!

751
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:36,060
Look at this!

752
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:41,860
She ran away?

753
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,100
What a crazy ninja...

754
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:02,810
If you stay always afraid of this Smasher, you won't hit me with any attack!

755
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,550
Who said I was afraid?!...

756
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,860
Fear and pain weaken
your determination.

757
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:14,230
Smash Tornado!

758
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:31,580
I'm a rubber man, bullets wont work!

759
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:34,610
Really?

760
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,850
I'm loosing my strength...

761
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,220
Your body won't move anymore.

762
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:46,890
This ammo is
made of Kairouseki.

763
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,630
You didn't expected this, did you?

764
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:52,900
After all, it's not an easy
task getting Kairouseki.

765
01:00:53,930 --> 01:01:00,270
This thing wouldn't hit the most powerful who live here in the New World,

766
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:05,940
but works wonders on those who are too convinced in their own power and let their guard down.

767
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:10,720
You too
are a sinful man.

768
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,790
This straw hat
also got old...

769
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:24,300
I'm going to bury it with my own hands, together with this Great Pirate Age.

770
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:29,670
Give it back!

771
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:33,470
I got that hat from
Shanks, to take care of it!

772
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,270
I promised I would find
him and give him that hat back!

773
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:37,440
Give it back!

774
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:43,150
The one who dragged you into this pirate business was Shanks, the redhead?!

775
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,620
His sins are also deep...

776
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,820
Give it back.

777
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,990
Don't you worry.

778
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:55,930
When my plan, the Grande
Imbuto get's completed,

779
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:58,700
He will have
the same fate as you.

780
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:02,500
Those convinced fools who call them selves the Four Emperors...

781
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:08,470
Will all die without being able to do anything... Without even knowing of my plan.

782
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:09,980
Don't mock...

783
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:12,510
...on Shanks!

784
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:25,920
That's not good!

785
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,460
It seems that the
pyroclastic flow began.

786
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:30,900
Usopp!

787
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,130
Where is Luffy?...

788
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,100
Luffy!

789
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,670
Luffy! Luffy!

790
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,130
Luffy!

791
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:38,740
Luffy!

792
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:44,880
We can't do anything against that.

793
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,040
Lets go, guys!

794
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,250
How fast is that, really?

795
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,760
They say its more than 100 KM/h!

796
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,190
I get it!

797
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:00,860
I know! If this is a descent,

798
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,390
Hissatsu Midori Bosshi!

799
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,060
Boaty Banana!

800
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,930
Jump!

801
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,140
We need more speed!

802
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:14,810
It has no engine! It's just a boat!

803
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,440
Look out!
We're gonna hit!

804
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,140
It also has no helm!
It's just a boat!...

805
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,250
To the right!

806
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,550
Now it's divided in two!

807
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,020
We won't make it!

808
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:35,390
Damn it!

809
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,830
They're here!

810
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,400
Those are some nice fireworks, huh!

811
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,870
It blew up the entire island...

812
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,680
Master... What
about that straw hat guy?

813
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,650
The fire mountain
will decide his fate.

814
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,360
One Piece?
Everything in this world?

815
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,930
What a ridiculous dream.

816
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:58,870
How many sacrifices do they think it took? How much suffering and hatred?

817
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:08,210
They can call that will, freedom... If that's what they call the new age, then I'll squash it all!

818
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:15,280
I'll use my own hands to get rid of all the pirates in this world, to the very last.

819
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:21,190
Your dreams will
end in deep hatred.

820
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:28,200
I, Z, will close the
curtains on the Great Pirate Age!

821
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:35,070
What happened to him
in the past was really terrible.

822
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:41,480
But causing a tragedy like this, involving innocent civilians as a motive...

823
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,240
It is not right...

824
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,850
Dry as always...

825
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:50,790
Not everyone can easily
separate things like you do.

826
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,360
Am I right, Sengoku?

827
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:05,630
Vice-Admiral Garp!

828
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,130
What is it?

829
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:13,340
Z... No, the former Marine, Admiral Zephyr...
What kind of person was he?

830
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:21,750
He, more than anyone,
believed in the Navy justice.

831
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:25,780
Then why is he
doing this?

832
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,420
A certain accident happened.

833
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:30,090
An accident?

834
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:33,890
Zephyr was a serious man.

835
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:39,130
Even on the dangerous battlefields, he was always in front of his subordinates,

836
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:43,930
and he risked his life fighting
against the rivals of that era.

837
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,340
He became an Admiral of
the Navy when he was still young.

838
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:57,180
And when he was living an happy life, his wife and son were killed by a pirate that hated Zephyr.

839
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:02,390
By fully understanding the burden of
having a position as a Navy Admiral...

840
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:06,720
Zephyr kept that hatred and
sadness in the bottom of his heart

841
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,530
and continued his mission.

842
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:18,400
The years passed and Zephyr pledged himself on training the young Marines. The man who created all Marines...

843
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:26,340
Every soldier that raised their
patents lately, are his apprentices.

844
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,160
I want to
create a hero.

845
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:35,330
However, a bigger
tragedy fell upon him.

846
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,470
The training ship of the new
recruits commanded by Zephyr

847
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,910
was attacked by a pirate
with Devil Fruit powers.

848
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:58,520
And only Zephyr and two more survived, everyone else were killed. Zephyr lost his arm.

849
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,520
Took an arm from a Navy Admiral?

850
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:06,900
And then, Zephyr got a weapon to defeat Devil Fruit users, from the Navy scientists.

851
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:11,200
And together with his disciples,
he created an attack unit.

852
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,540
And he hunted down
Devil Fruit users.

853
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:18,540
He was still in the Navy,

854
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,010
but that was when they
weren't disappointed with the Navy.

855
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:35,190
And then, the only thing that was keeping him in the Navy was destroyed.

856
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:43,900
That year, the pirate that had killed his disciples,
was chosen to be a War Lord by the government.

857
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,570
And so, Zephyr left the navy.

858
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:53,380
And now he showed
up in the New World.

859
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:58,250
Hating pirates...
Disappointed with the Navy...

860
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:02,250
Leading the organization
he created, the New navy.

861
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,450
The unacceptable reality...

862
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,690
has changed that man.

863
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:14,220
You suck, Navy!

864
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:20,830
Why does Black Fist
Zephyr is called Z now?

865
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:22,170
Z..........

866
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,700
Who knows?

867
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:30,670
I can't say that. Enemies
without hesitation are strong.

868
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:41,020
The sea is watching...

869
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:46,890
The beginning of the world...

870
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:53,730
The sea knows...

871
01:09:54,530 --> 01:10:00,000
Of the end of the world...

872
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:07,680
Even if I...

873
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:14,320
...disappear...

874
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:21,090
He knows everything...

875
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:26,660
You shouldn't be afraid...

876
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:33,900
...the orientations of the sea.

877
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:40,340
As you are here...

878
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:47,250
...you should not fear it.

879
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:53,090
Because your friend are waiting for you.

880
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:59,900
I hated that song,
master.

881
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:05,900
A song for the Marines who
travel north does not excite me.

882
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,740
You liked that, didn't you?

883
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:17,350
Yes. This is the best drink.

884
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:21,720
I also used to drink that
a lot, imitating you.

885
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,720
I wanted to be a cool man like you.

886
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:29,230
You came to give a lecture
to a stubborn old man?

887
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:33,330
Sorry,
but I won't stop.

888
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,770
Do you intend to die?

889
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:38,900
If that happens, there is no problem.

890
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,840
It's to get rid of
the evil called pirates.

891
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,240
The Navy can't execute
the true justice.

892
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:50,910
I'm sorry, but step aside.

893
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:54,450
Next time we meet,
let's drink together.

894
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:59,260
Go now, I don't want to kill you.

895
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:00,790
Neither do I.

896
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,290
Master Zephyr...

897
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:51,210
This is a Kairouseki bullet?

898
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:54,410
It was on Luffy's shoulder.

899
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:18,100
How long will
you stay here?

900
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:21,940
A-Aokiji!

901
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:25,240
You!...

902
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,950
What is Aokiji doing here?

903
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,280
It's alright.

904
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,250
We met a few moments ago.

905
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:40,960
Z is a former Navy Admiral?

906
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:44,830
He stole the Dyna
Rocks from the Navy.

907
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:45,960
Dyna Rocks?!

908
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,170
What is that?

909
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:53,170
Those are rocks they say it has a power comparable to the Ancient Weapons.

910
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:55,740
If they receive an impact and are exposed to oxygen, they create a massive explosion.

911
01:13:55,740 --> 01:14:03,480
But due to its massive power, it's use is forbidden in civil zones.

912
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:07,890
The Navy has control of them all.
And now Z stole them?

913
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:14,930
He wants to use them to destroy the three End Point's of the New World.

914
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:18,130
Stop right there!
What are these End Points?

915
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,670
At the New World sea there are three magma concentrations,

916
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:25,070
and they call it End Point.

917
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:29,410
When I heard that from
a Marine, I doubted it...

918
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:31,280
Does that really exist?

919
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:35,910
I can't believe that breasted
lady turned into this dull little girl...

920
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:37,750
Are you listening to me?!

921
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:40,680
Does the End Point
really exist? Or not?

922
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:44,890
They do.

923
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:48,360
First, second...

924
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:54,570
Even when they hear the news about those two islands, all the pirates must be laughing thinking thinking it's nonsense.

925
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:59,600
Many know the legend of the End Points, but no ones believes it.

926
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:05,080
But the government investigated and declared the legend was false!

927
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,950
It's because the investigation results were different from what was announced.

928
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:16,020
The government used every possible means to make the world believe it was a lie.

929
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:20,290
Don't you think it would be terrible if pirates showed up wanting to use that?

930
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:25,200
Only the Government and the Navy superiors know about that.

931
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:32,600
But no one never thought
a former Admiral would use that.

932
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,700
That's true.

933
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:37,940
If it was a lie, the Navy
wouldn't be so desperate.

934
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,450
We got involved with a very dangerous man.

935
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:47,280
Z already destroyed two
End Points with the Dyna Rocks.

936
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,590
If he destroys the last one...

937
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:55,960
There will be a chain reaction that connects all three End Points.

938
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,960
Reaction?

939
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:04,640
There will be a major catastrophic eruption, that will burn the entire New World sea!

940
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:10,170
Every single pirate in the
New World will get burned to death.

941
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:15,580
But if he does that, he'll also
involve the innocent people!

942
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:20,480
Wait a second! He will involve
civilians... That's just wrong!

943
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,690
Don't you think you're
thinking too much about yourselves?

944
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:30,830
How much fear and victims do you think pirates cause in the world? Don't tell me you don't know.

945
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,330
Z hates all of that...

946
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:37,100
He hates it so much that
he doesn't care if he dies along.

947
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,200
It doesn't matter!

948
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,070
I'm going there to get my hat back!
I'm going to settle things with him!

949
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:48,210
Are you crazy, Luffy?
The New World will be destroyed!

950
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:51,220
I promised Shanks.

951
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:56,820
That I would become a great
pirate and return him that hat.

952
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:02,490
If I let that guy take my hat, I won't be able to become the Pirate King.

953
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:05,500
But you know...
The New World will...

954
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:10,700
That won't work with the
stubbornness of our captain.

955
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,140
Nami, which way?

956
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,710
Ah, yes. Let's see...

957
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:23,750
I've already offered my life
to captain Luffy, so I'll follow him.

958
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,320
Then let's go.

959
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:31,760
Do we really
need to do that?

960
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,530
Isn't the fate of the New
World too much for us?

961
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:38,500
You two want to stay?

962
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:44,370
What are you saying, you idiot?
When did I said that?

963
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:48,210
Of course I'm going!
I'm the brave sea warrior!

964
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:49,370
Isn't that right, Chopper?

965
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,410
Yes! Let's go!

966
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:57,080
War with that darned man!

967
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:13,430
Franky, how much longer?

968
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:17,070
It's ready!...
The repair is finished!

969
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:18,940
We can go at any time!

970
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,110
Super!

971
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:29,450
Guys, thank you!

972
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,680
What are you saying?

973
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:41,160
It seems they've decided.

974
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,930
The island where the last End Point is, where Z is... It's this way.

975
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,370
An Eternal Pose?!
Why are you giving this to us?

976
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:51,340
What do you mean, why?

977
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:54,810
Without it, you can't go
to the island where Z is.

978
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:56,610
Well, that's true, but...

979
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,610
The Navy is moving,
they also went to the last island.

980
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:01,680
The Navy too?

981
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:07,150
As two End Points were already destroyed, the Navy is taking it seriously now.

982
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:11,390
If you loose to Z, you'll be
destroyed along with the New World.

983
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:17,860
Even if you win, you'll be surrounded by the Navy and you'll also be destroyed.

984
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:22,870
Anyway, I want to
see it until the end.

985
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:27,040
Our initial objective was returning Nami and the others to normal,

986
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,770
and now it turned into a battle with the future of the New World at stake.

987
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:35,250
Guys, do you remember
the strongest equipment?

988
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:43,350
They brought the ships
Z sunk to these docks.

989
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:51,230
The old with pity to throw away the things and dreams that others have left behind... And he saved it all.

990
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:54,530
So, it's
great, isn't it?

991
01:19:55,070 --> 01:20:01,070
Let's bring along the feelings of the pirates
defeated by Z, and attack him with everything!

992
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,110
I'm counting on you!

993
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:12,020
Defeat Z, that's trying to
take the sailors freedom!

994
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,730
Guys!

995
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:37,010
When I grow up,
I want to be a hero!

996
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:40,910
Which one should I be,
a Navy Admiral or a Pirate?

997
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:43,080
Pirates aren't Heroes.

998
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,450
Really?

999
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:47,920
They're both
the same to you?

1000
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,250
Yes...

1001
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:50,750
You guys are cool!

1002
01:20:57,430 --> 01:21:01,130
Gari! The best is
to do what you like!

1003
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:28,890
Keep going in this direction!

1004
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:30,530
Prepare the frontal cannon!

1005
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,000
Target: Enemy fleet!

1006
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,800
Ready...

1007
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,210
Frontal cannon, fire!

1008
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,020
I see it! It's the last island!

1009
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:02,830
They're here!

1010
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:04,860
Don't let them
reach Master Z!

1011
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:14,400
Where the hell is Z?

1012
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:17,370
Let us pass!

1013
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:21,650
You go on ahead!

1014
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:28,720
Take that!

1015
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,320
Usopp 100 Tons Hammer!

1016
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,390
Take that!

1017
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:34,360
I'll leave the
rest with you!

1018
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,830
Leave the rest to me, Usopp!

1019
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:38,560
Guard Point!

1020
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,700
Shooting with full power!

1021
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:49,310
Z...!

1022
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:57,050
They got separated...

1023
01:22:57,950 --> 01:23:00,250
But it's an awesome sight...

1024
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:01,220
Modo, Modo!

1025
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:07,760
I won't let you reach the master!
I'm going to stop you!

1026
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,330
I'm glad...

1027
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:12,260
I have nothing against you, mas this is to return my friends to normal.

1028
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:16,070
I'm fighting with everything I got.

1029
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,470
Indeed, if we fight normally,
I'm not going to win.

1030
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:22,340
But I'll win him some time.

1031
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:27,340
I don't mind dieing for
Master Z ideals.

1032
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:30,480
Your master ideals, uh...

1033
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:34,020
So you're ready to throw
your lives away for that?

1034
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:38,160
However, I felt hesitation
in you sword.

1035
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:41,490
Don't be so sure of
your self, you pirate!

1036
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:46,530
You lowly pirate!

1037
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:49,230
You have no right to live!

1038
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:53,140
Die before Master Z!

1039
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,610
Master... Master... always that,
are you kids, by any chance?

1040
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,620
I'm getting tired.

1041
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,710
It started...

1042
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:40,250
So that the old man doesn't get sad, we're going to kill the Straw Hat's without leaving any of them alive.

1043
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:46,480
Gomu Gomu no Pistol!

1044
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,820
-Don't let him get away!
-Shoot him!

1045
01:25:56,430 --> 01:25:57,460
Take that!

1046
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:20,620
Modo, Modo!

1047
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,300
Listen do the requiem
of the other world.

1048
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,970
Soul Solid!

1049
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,340
Mil Fleur!
Gigantesco Mano! Stomp!

1050
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:08,630
Take that!

1051
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,600
Hissatsu Midori Bosshi!

1052
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,870
Take Javelin!

1053
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:24,080
I'm going to show you the
power of my Magical Clima-Tact!

1054
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:25,850
Heat Ball!

1055
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:27,350
Cool Ball!

1056
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:32,520
Thunderbolt Tempo!

1057
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:54,210
Damn you Nami!
You got us too!

1058
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:57,050
That was
quite a shock!

1059
01:27:57,650 --> 01:28:00,150
-It was good, wasn't it?
-What was good?

1060
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:03,550
You guys defeated
a lot of them.

1061
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:04,590
What about Luffy?

1062
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:06,690
He went on ahead...

1063
01:28:06,690 --> 01:28:08,590
Then let's go right after him...

1064
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:10,760
Guys, look!

1065
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:14,000
Those are the Pacifists!

1066
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,630
But those are different
from the ones we saw before...

1067
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,070
You came, boy.

1068
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:29,810
The explosion that's going to destroy the last End Point already began.

1069
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:33,280
I didn't come
here for that.

1070
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,450
I'm only here to
get my straw hat back!

1071
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:39,760
This hat?...
What does it mean to you?

1072
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:41,430
It's what shows me the path.

1073
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:44,290
The path to become the Pirate King.

1074
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:56,270
I wont allow pirates to have dreams!
And I'll destroy the sea you keep sailing!

1075
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,350
Remember this...

1076
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:09,120
The name of whom will
destroy evil... my name is Z!

1077
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:22,670
That's useless!

1078
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:26,340
Did you stopped thinking
and came here just to attack me?

1079
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:38,350
Not good!

1080
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,530
Sorry it took so long, guys!

1081
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,860
Let's go, partner!

1082
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:55,830
It's here!

1083
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,040
Iron Pirate!

1084
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,840
General Franky!

1085
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:17,420
Awesome!

1086
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:21,890
Franky Radical Beam!

1087
01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:30,570
That's so cool!

1088
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:41,450
Mosa, Mosa!

1089
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:44,050
Sky Walk!

1090
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:48,590
Diable Jumble!

1091
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:55,660
Take this!

1092
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:15,350
Santoryu!

1093
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:17,580
Seiryuuin!

1094
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:22,450
Ryuusui!

1095
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:30,330
If you're not sure,
cut them your self.

1096
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:34,100
I prefer the sexy Nami!

1097
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,370
Sexy fire!

1098
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,370
Burn

1099
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:42,210
Meteor attack of love!

1100
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:42,210
Take this!

1101
01:31:50,410 --> 01:31:53,180
You can fall in love, Nami.

1102
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:33,620
I'm back!

1103
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:35,360
I also came back to normal!

1104
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,230
-Really?

1105
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:40,130
It's really great! The 90 years!

1106
01:32:40,130 --> 01:32:42,130
Zoro and the other did it!

1107
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:45,170
Now there is only Z left!
Let's join Luffy!

1108
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,680
It's useless!

1109
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,180
You can't destroy my justice!

1110
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:03,090
Gomu Gomu no Pistol!

1111
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:07,390
Gatling!

1112
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:16,900
Even being a
pirate, you have courage.

1113
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:19,300
Much better than that wimpy Navy!

1114
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,570
But...!

1115
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:22,140
Gear Third!

1116
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:26,040
Gigant Pistol!

1117
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:36,990
I am... Z!

1118
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,790
Z!...

1119
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:45,560
Smash Buster!

1120
01:34:08,490 --> 01:34:09,320
Luffy.

1121
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:21,970
Boy...

1122
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:25,970
Why do you want to
face me so much?

1123
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:31,980
Even if you defeat me,
in the end, you're still a pirate.

1124
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:36,210
Nobody from the
society will thank you.

1125
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:39,020
And so what?

1126
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,250
I'll do what I want!

1127
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:47,390
If I'm not able to defeat you, I also won't be able to become the Pirate King.

1128
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:50,260
Is that so?

1129
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:54,200
You sound like a kid.

1130
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:16,390
You'll do what you want?

1131
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:20,390
If that's the case,
I'll do the same.

1132
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:27,030
I'll dedicate my entire life
to end with your ambition!

1133
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:31,570
Come at me! This is the final battle!

1134
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:50,650
Black Fist Zephyr... has returned!

1135
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:56,950
I will do it!

1136
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:04,330
I will become the Pirate King!

1137
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:11,130
My name is... Z!

1138
01:37:15,670 --> 01:37:17,240
You bastard!

1139
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:06,120
I got old...

1140
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:11,030
With only that and my body
doesn't want to move anymore...

1141
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:13,100
What a shame...

1142
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,940
That fun moment
ended so quickly...

1143
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:24,370
Frankly, that battle ended
right on time, what a close call.

1144
01:38:24,370 --> 01:38:25,710
Luffy!

1145
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:43,790
Those who follow their dreams, destroy everything and move on.

1146
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,730
Take your straw
hat and my life.

1147
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:53,840
I don't want your life.

1148
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:56,070
I'm already satisfied.

1149
01:38:58,180 --> 01:39:00,140
If you want to
continue, I don't mind.

1150
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:03,480
No.

1151
01:39:04,150 --> 01:39:06,250
I'm also satisfied.

1152
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:08,590
Luffy!

1153
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,960
Are you okey, Luffy?

1154
01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:16,330
Guys!...

1155
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:18,000
"Guys", nothing!

1156
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:19,930
You went on ahead again!

1157
01:39:21,230 --> 01:39:22,370
Master Z!

1158
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,270
Ain... Binz...

1159
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:36,150
Forgive me... for giving
you so much work...

1160
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:39,850
Me... Me...

1161
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:42,890
I'm happy to
see that you're alright.

1162
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:47,690
It seems everyone is gathered here.

1163
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:50,730
Kizaru...!

1164
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:55,500
It's a shame that the Straw Hat and Master Zephyr are almost dead.

1165
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:59,500
But seeing you're all going
to die anyway, it's the same.

1166
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:02,410
Damn it,
just at time like this...

1167
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:06,740
You brought them all...

1168
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:13,550
At the end, I did what I wanted.

1169
01:40:14,150 --> 01:40:17,120
Now I have to pay
the price for doing what I wanted.

1170
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:21,090
Or I wouldn't be able
to face the ones that went before me.

1171
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,290
Straw Hat Luffy.

1172
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:27,730
You have your own adventure, don't you?

1173
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:31,700
Leave the rest with me, Z!

1174
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:32,640
Old man!

1175
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,470
No, Master!

1176
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:48,550
Kuzan! You made a place
where I'd be able to die?

1177
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,990
Master! Master! Master...

1178
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:58,160
Master...

1179
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:19,420
Yasakani no Magatama!

1180
01:41:22,050 --> 01:41:24,990
Borsalino!

1181
01:41:24,990 --> 01:41:27,960
Good bye, master Zephyr!

1182
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:56,520
I'll give you
guys your last training!

1183
01:42:50,910 --> 01:42:51,940
Don't cry!

1184
01:42:55,610 --> 01:43:00,420
He ended his life as he wanted to.

1185
01:43:03,890 --> 01:43:05,420
Don't you think he's incredible?

1186
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:30,610
We're going to remember this!

1187
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:32,720
Come at me when you want!

1188
01:43:33,650 --> 01:43:36,950
I'm the hero of justice, my name is...

1189
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:40,960
Z!...
