irrespective of suit.

of a woman's name.

What was that name?

118
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,554
- Her name was Lilly.
- That is correct.

119

- Then go back and try again.
- Back where?

How is it detonated?

- Right.
- Find the bomb,

and you will find the bomber.

00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:14,157
Ticket? May I see your ticket?

168
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,636
They wouldn't put the doer in front of me.

169
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,938
- The doer?
- You're the pretty girl.

170
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,778
- CONDUCTOR: Ticket?
- The distraction.

171
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,679
- Distraction?
- Every sim has one.

172
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,014
Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?

173
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,213
- We are gonna try, sir.
- Are you talking about Bryan?

174
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:38,156
Hey, Grandpa,
what the hell was the delay back there?

175
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,117
- What are you late for?
- What?

176
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:44,392
You seem concerned about the time.
What are you late for?

177
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:47,434
I'm on my way to an asshole festival.
I hear you're headlining.

178
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,526
That's funny. What are you, a comedian?

179
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,695
Yeah.

180
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,201
He is a comedian.

181
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:54,936
Sit down.

182
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,331
Freak.

183
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,474
Fans.

184
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:01,781
That's the guy.

185
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,477
He came in third on America's Got Talent.
Got cited twice for a DUI.

186
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,648
- (ANNOUNCER CHATTERING)
- We talked about him.

187
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,747
- Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

188
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:13,520
Glenbrook Station.

189
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,891
Yeah, but by 1:00
the bridge is gonna be jammed.

190
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,223
WOMAN: Damn it!

191
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:19,663
MAN: I'm sorry.

192
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,861
WOMAN: Just let me get it, okay?

193
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,803
Hey, mister!

194
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,242
Hey!

195
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,405
Hey! You dropped this.

196
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:37,544
Thanks.

197
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:53,799
ANNOUNCER: All aboard.

198
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,294
Doors are closing.

199
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:13,679
This is a Chicago-bound train.

200
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,985
The explosion came from behind me.

201
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,053
- What's with you?
- I don't have time to talk to you right now.

202
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,496
MAX: I got time for you.

203
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:27,431
Next stop, Chicago.

204
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,302
Union Station.

205
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,173
Holy shit.

206
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,617
(BEEPS)

207
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,428
Goodwin?

208
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:32,260
You gonna tell me how to disarm this?

209
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,060
Uh...

210
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,303
Should I...

211
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:42,433
Unplug it?
Or do you want me to just leave it? Or...

212
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,543
Okay, um...

213
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:49,744
(EXHALES)

214
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,410
I'm just gonna leave it.

215
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:56,146
Okay?

216
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,187
I'll be late.

217
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,206
Ladies and gentlemen, transit security.

218
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,876
- No, you're not.
- Due to a classified security breach,

219
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:28,318
I need all of you to turn off
any personal electronic devices

220
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,719
until we pull into the station, okay?

221
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,153
That means laptops, cell phones.
Cell phone, sir? Cell phone, sir.

222
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,456
Thank you very much.
Pagers, anything electronic.

223
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,997
Thank you. It's just a precautionary
measure. Nothing to worry about.

224
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,564
So which is it?
Security breach or precautionary measure?

225
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:42,363
Sir? Sir.

226
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:45,797
Is there a problem here, sir?

227
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,306
- I'm in the middle of a very big deal.
- Sean?

228
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,843
- I need you to turn that off.
- Why don't you show me that ID again?

229
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:51,900
- Sean?
- Turn it off.

230
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,007
- Turn it off.
- What's your problem, asshole?

231
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,137
Hey!

232
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,345
Sean! What are you doing?

233
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,550
Hey, not a good idea, ma'am.
Not a good idea.

234
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,413
That's not a good idea.

235
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,047
- I think you broke his jaw.
- It's okay.

236
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,284
He's not any more real than you are.

237
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,758
I'm not real?
How about next time you drive to work?

238
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:09,022
Not gonna be a next time.

239
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,043
(GASPING)

240
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:28,773
Stabilize.

241
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,986
Lower your pulse.

242
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,249
Did you find the bomb?

243
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,819
Yes.

244
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,199
There's hydraulic fluid all over the floor.

245
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,168
It's not a concern, Captain.

246
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,002
- What is...
- Tell me about the bomb.

247
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,512
Where's that man?
I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.

248
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,015
He looks like he's in charge.
I want to talk to him.

249
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,243
That's irrelevant, Captain.

250
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,114
I want to talk to your commanding officer!

251
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,414
You can talk to him upon completion
of your mission.

252
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,458
My mission is in Afghanistan,
where my unit is.

253
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:14,790
I flew two goddamn sorties yesterday!

254
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,958
You've been with us for two months.

255
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,568
Did you ID the bomber?

256
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,671
No. Where's my unit?

257
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,502
And under whose jurisdiction
is this simulation?

258
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,877
Captain, this is not a simulation.
Lives are depending on you.

259
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:36,671
What lives?

260
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:40,182
What do you remember about the bomb?
Tell me about the detonator.

261
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,584
No, no, no. What lives?
What are you talking about?

262
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:45,090
I need to be briefed.

263
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,268
Sir, I need to give him something.

264
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,661
That's fine. Go ahead.

265
00:18:58,738 --> 00:18:59,932
Okay.

266
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,604
Get ready to send him back in.

267
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:08,111
MAN: We're still waiting. Justin is trying to do
all the profiles right now.

268
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,978
At 7:48 this morning,
Central Standard Time,

269
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:14,748
a bomb exploded on a commuter train
outside of Chicago,

270
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,289
killing everyone on board.

271
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,257
And that's the train that you've been on.

272
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,420
No, no, no. I'm right here.
You're talking to me right now.

273
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:26,062
A man named Sean Fentress
was on that train.

274
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:30,694
He, for all intents and purposes, is now you.

275
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,500
Every second spent explaining things

276
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,542
puts more innocent civilians at risk.

277
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,637
- This makes no sense.
- The train explosion

278
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:42,739
was the first attack of a series.
There are going to be more.

279
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,309
Now, did you find the bomb?

280
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,688
In the restroom.

281
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,223
Ventilation panel above the sink.

282
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,158
Cell phone detonator.

283
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:58,055
Are we done?

284
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:01,561
No, no. But that's good.
That's very, very good, Captain.

285
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,100
Good.

286
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:08,802
Our records show that 1,812 calls ended
at the moment of the explosion.

287
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,333
Fifty-two of those calls were tethered
to the cell tower nearest the train.

288
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,710
So, one of those calls was made
by our bomber.

289
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:18,478
Do you remember a freight train passing by
just before the explosion?

290
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,212
- Yes.
- The explosion was timed

291
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:21,686
to engulf the passing freight train,

292
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:25,748
which means the bomber had to be watching
both trains when the call was made.

293
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,653
Fifty-two callers.

294
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,218
One of those is our bomber.

295
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:34,063
I want you to concentrate on the passengers
in your car. Get to know them.

296
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,196
Narrow the suspect pool.
Look for ones who seem

297
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,831
quiet or withdrawn.

298
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,569
Who seem nervous.

299
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,270
As always, you will have eight minutes.

300
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,510
Eight minutes and then I blow up again?

301
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,040
Yes.

302
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:56,381
I need you to discipline yourself
on this next pass.

303
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,549
Perform only the tasks that we assign you.

304
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,990
Everything else is irrelevant.

305
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,152
Charge the drivers.

306
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:04,355
Okay. Has my father even...

307
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:15,269
I took your advice.

308
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,234
It was very good advice.

309
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,107
MAN: Watch it.

310
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:23,774
- CHRISTINA: You're kind of quiet today.
- (CAN OPENING)

311
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,340
Just got a lot on my mind.

312
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:26,407
Careful.

313
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:27,780
CHRISTINA: Yikes.

314
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,412
- So sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

315
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,584
Ticket?

316
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:35,650
That was very kind of you.

317
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,099
You're very decent.

318
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,638
Thank you.

319
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:52,311
You're real.

320
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,740
Ticket?

321
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:57,174
- COLTER: How's everything today?
- It's good.

322
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,718
- Anything out of the ordinary?
- No.

323
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,346
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
- I meant behavior on the train.

324
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:06,051
Does anything, anybody
seem strange to you?

325
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:07,752
You're a little strange.

326
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:14,092
How about you?
Does anybody look suspicious?

327

with the minister and Denoff there.

He's the expendable one.

00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:29,268
When a light bulb is turned off,
there's an after-glow,

490
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,468
a lingering, halo-like effect.
Have you seen it?

491
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,668
- Yes.
- Of course.

492
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,616
The brain is like that.
Its electromagnetic field remains charged,

493
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,811
just briefly, even after death.
Circuits remain open.

494
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,951
Now, there's another peculiarity
about the brain.

495
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,718
It contains a short-term memory track

496
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,452
that's approximately eight minutes long.

497
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:49,957
Like a convenience store security camera

498
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:53,396
that only records the last portion
of the day's activity on its hard drive.

499
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:56,263
Now, in combining these two phenomena,

500
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:58,899
circuitry that remains viable post-mortem

501
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:01,462
and a memory bank
that goes back eight minutes,

502
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,873
source code enables us to capitalize
on the overlap.

503
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,841
Sean Fentress died on that train.

504
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,141
Of all the passengers aboard,

505
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:12,673
he was your best link.
You two share compatibility

506
00:34:12,752 --> 00:34:16,586
in terms of gender, body-size,
and your synaptic maps.

507
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:18,350
What happens after the eight minutes?

508
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:22,785
After? Nothing.
You cease to exist on the train.

509
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:27,823
You cannot exist inside the source code
beyond Fentress's eight minutes.

510
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:33,471
Source code is not time travel.

511
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:37,168
Rather, source code is time reassignment.

512
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:41,179
It gives us access to a parallel reality.

513
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,579
Now, the deaths on that train were a tragedy,

514
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:45,048
but source code empowers us...

515
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:48,314
No, but I saved one person.

516
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:50,947
That girl that's always sitting
across from me.

517
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:53,753
I pulled her off the train.

518
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:55,589
Give me her name.

519
00:34:56,862 --> 00:35:00,320
Christina. I don't remember her last name.

520
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,197
Her name was Christina Warren.

521
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:11,404
- Yes.
- She was 28.

522
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,775
- That's her.
- Born in Wilmette, Illinois.

523
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:15,006
Died this morning on the train.

524
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:19,811
No, no. I pulled her off. She's fine.

525
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:20,909
No, she isn't.

526
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:22,415
Believe me. She is.

527
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:23,844
Believe me!

528
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:26,187
She saw me get hit by the express train.

529
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,156
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- No, no, no, wait.

530
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:32,357
Sir, we have to send him in.
A second attack is imminent, Dr. Rutledge.

531
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:33,455
What second attack?

532
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:36,627
The train was just the beginning,
a letter of intent.

533
00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:38,333
(STAMMERING)

534
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:40,201
What aren't you telling me here?

535
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:44,066
We have information
that downtown Chicago is the next target,

536
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,338
and they're planning to detonate
a dirty bomb.

537
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:48,809
Do you have any idea
how many people would die

538
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:51,406
if an explosion of that magnitude
were to occur in the city?

539
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:52,877
We're evacuating as we speak.

540
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,545
We have to stop it before it happens.
Do you understand?

541
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:58,351
GOODWIN: If you find the bomber,
his second attack,

542
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:00,949
the real attack, we think, can be prevented.

543
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:04,760
We have very little time left. Out here,
the clocks only move in one direction.

544
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:07,131
Charge the drivers.

545
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:10,100
GOODWIN: On the upper deck of the next
carriage, there's a conductor's compartment.

546
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:12,461
It's a small office containing a strongbox.

547
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:14,836
Inside is a loaded handgun.

548
00:36:14,907 --> 00:36:18,104
Get to it. You are authorized to use
whatever force necessary.

549
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,005
CHRISTINA: (ECHOING) I took your advice.

550
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,385
It was very good advice.

551
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,658
You're still here.

552
00:36:34,727 --> 00:36:36,786
Of course I am.

553
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:37,851
Guess what?

554
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,190
You quit your job
and you enrolled in an LSAT course.

555
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,057
Good guess.

556
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:43,258
Soda can.

557
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:44,893
- Coffee spill.
- (TRICKLING)

558
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:47,772
Listen to me.

559
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:49,736
Don't answer this.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

561
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:52,303
You deserve better than that guy.

562
00:36:52,845 --> 00:36:55,609
Everything looks more beautiful
in retrospect, doesn't it?

563
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,447
- CONDUCTOR: Ticket?
- How did you know that was...

564
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,311
- Are we going to make up the 10 minutes?
- We are going to try, sir.

565
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:02,013
- How well do you know me?
- MAX: Hey, Grandpa...

566
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:03,349
Not that well, apparently.

567
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,287
Do you know me well enough
that if I did something that looked

568
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:07,120
a little strange
and was maybe even a little bit dangerous,

569
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,251
but I told you to trust me anyway,
that you could do that?

570
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:11,990
No.

571
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:15,628
Wow. That was honest.

572
00:37:18,037 --> 00:37:20,335
You're beautiful. You're kind.

573
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:22,501
And you're painfully honest.

574
00:37:22,942 --> 00:37:25,433
Who are you?
And what did you do with Sean Fentress?

575
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:26,944
It's the new me.

All right, I don't wanna hurt you.

CHRISTINA: No, I'm not gonna sit in my seat,
all right? He's bleeding.

583
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:54,831
He needs medical attention.

584
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:59,201
Is it true that you tried to steal a gun
out of the train's security box?

585
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:00,795
Careful, ma'am.

586
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:04,474
- Damn it!
- What were you thinking?

587
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:07,272
- Can I borrow your phone?
- No! You need to go to the hospital, Sean.

588
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:10,315
- Please, please, let me borrow your phone.
- No! Why do you want my phone?

589
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:17,888
What would you do
if you only had a minute left to live?

590
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,951
I don't know.

591
00:39:22,895 --> 00:39:24,658
I would call my dad.

592
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:28,031
I would hear his voice,

593
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:31,896
and I'd tell him I was sorry.

Oh, yeah, the gun in the strongbox,
that was a really great idea. Thanks for that.

598
00:40:03,335 --> 00:40:04,393
Did you make any progress?

599
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,260
Can I get access to a phone?

600
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,406
I need to talk to my father.

601
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:12,470
I will try to work on that soon.
Yes. I will try.

602
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,441
Goodwin, how am I doing?

603
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,280
I'm just trying
to measure my performance here.

604
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:25,221
Have you ever gone back in?
Am I doing better than you did?

605
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:28,954
We are wasting valuable time here.

606
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:40,132
No, no.

607
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:43,333
I have never been on the other side
of a source code mission.

608
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:46,343
- I wouldn't be a viable candidate.
- Why not?

(MUTTERING) CAOC-N. What is that?

Because the specifications
are extremely narrow.

611
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:53,616
What are they?

612
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:56,779
Captain, you should have found a suspect
by now.

613
00:40:57,156 --> 00:41:00,956
This tactical advantage,
this tremendous tool that we've given you,

614
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,721
don't squander it thinking. Do.

615
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,994
Please contact my father for me.

616
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:10,135
This will stop at some point, Captain.

617
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:13,527
As soon as you finish the mission.

618
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:16,936
And you're doing really great.

619
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,066
And this will end.

620
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:24,073
Now, whoever planted the bomb
had to have equipment of some kind.

621
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:27,448
Some gloves, a screwdriver to get
into the overhead vent,

622
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:28,508
flashlight, something.

623
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:32,515
Check bags and backpacks,
briefcases, anything.

624
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:37,729
So, I took your advice.

625
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,087
- It was very good advice.
- Hey, Grandpa...

626
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:59,644
- What are you doing?
- I'm just trying to remember something.

627
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:01,652
- What is that?
- It's a military patch.

628
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,519
Were you in the military?

629
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:07,648
A friend of mine was.

630
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:12,390
He was in Afghanistan and he disappeared,
and no one's heard from him since.

631
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,202
Do you have the Internet on your phone?

632
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:19,828
No.

633
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:23,799
It's just connected to the office
by a really long piece of string.

634
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:28,506
Do you think you can see
what you could find on this guy?

635
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,810
- Sure.
- He's just been on my mind a lot lately.

636
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,544
His name is Captain Colter Stevens.
He's in the 17th Airborne.

637
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:35,443
Okay. You owe me.

638
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,152
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

639
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,554
Why don't I get one for you now?

640
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,092
Okay. Christina?

641
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:43,883
Um...

642
00:42:44,463 --> 00:42:47,057
I've been having these dreams lately.

643
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,967
Really vivid.

644
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:52,926
And you've been in them.

645
00:42:54,006 --> 00:42:55,030
Really?

646
00:42:55,107 --> 00:42:58,702
What? Oh. No. Not like that.
Not that I wouldn't. I...

647
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:00,267
It's just...

648
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,066
Um...

649
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:27,830
I'll call you back in a minute, all right? Yeah.

650
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:30,703
- Cramming?
- Uh, yeah.

651
00:43:31,243 --> 00:43:32,369
For what?

652
00:43:33,312 --> 00:43:37,908
Psych. And I got a big test this morning,
so I should get back to it.

653
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:40,110
Can I borrow a pen?

654
00:43:43,522 --> 00:43:44,921
Yeah, sure.

655
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:50,026
Whoa! Hey, that's not cool, man!

656
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:52,855
Hey, your bag is a mess.

657
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:54,798
What are you doing, man?

658
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:58,529
Never find what I'm looking for.
It's just like my bag. It's just like my bag.

659
00:43:58,603 --> 00:43:59,900
How about you let the guy
have his bag back?

660
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,268
Finish your deal.

661
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,274
Stay out of this, tough guy.
It doesn't end well for you.

662
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:06,108
This guy.

663
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,238
Don't do that.

664
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:10,577
Nothing. What am I doing?

665
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,645
Jesus.

666
00:44:15,354 --> 00:44:16,343
Dick.

667
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:17,479
CAOC-N.

668
00:44:17,556 --> 00:44:21,424
- WOMAN: Can you believe that?
- Asshole.

669
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:32,498
Excuse me, ma'am?

670
00:44:32,571 --> 00:44:34,038
Hey, how are you doing? Good morning.

671
00:44:34,106 --> 00:44:37,132
- Do you work at Walter Reed?
- Yeah, I used to.

672
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:40,476
- I'm in the military.
- You're in the military?

673
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:41,944
Yeah. Yeah, I am. I was wondering...

674
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,208
Then what was going on down there?

675
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,548
Oh, you know, uh...

676
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:52,954
We were just having a little bit
of an argument, actually, about this patch.

677
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,015
Is that what they train you to do?
Assault civilians?

678
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:58,256
No, ma'am, please. Do any of these letters,
they look familiar to you?

679
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:59,422
Do you know what the "N" stands for?

680
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:03,799
It's Air Force, and the "N" stands for Nellis.

681
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:06,167
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.

682
00:45:06,238 --> 00:45:08,433
Thank you. Can I borrow your phone?

683
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,432
You know what?
Actually, I can pay you for it.

684
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:14,605
I don't even need to borrow it.
I can pay you for it. I have $100.

685
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,580
- Just for a couple minutes...
- I don't want your money. Just bring it back.

686
00:45:17,649 --> 00:45:19,844
All right. Thank you so much.

687
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:30,128
This is a Chicago-bound train.

688
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:32,990
Next stop, Chicago,

689
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:35,432
Union Station.

690
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:37,763
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

691
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,100
Post Operator.

692
00:45:49,681 --> 00:45:52,741
- Rutledge, please.
- Please hold.

693
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,783
Name, please?

694
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:56,946
You tell him
Captain Colter Stevens is calling.

695
00:45:57,022 --> 00:45:59,923
- Hold the line.
- ANNOUNCER: All aboard.

696
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,322
Doors are closing.

697
00:46:01,393 --> 00:46:03,918
OPERATOR: Dr. Rutledge
will be on in a moment.

698
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:08,864
I have to tell you something.

699
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,629
- I know. I found him.
- Your friend?

700
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:14,934
- I got him. Nellis Air Force Base. Las Vegas.
- No, he's not...

701
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:17,101
He's dead, Sean.

702
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:19,902
What?

703
00:46:21,213 --> 00:46:24,444
I'm sorry. Your friend was killed
in action two months ago.

704
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,948
No, you must've gotten the name wrong.

705
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:29,543
Colter Stevens.
17th Airborne helicopter pilot.

706
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:31,088
It was on the first site I tried.

707
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:36,120
His father's name is Donald, right?

708
00:46:37,529 --> 00:46:39,360
This is from last week.

709
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:42,195
"Donald Stevens will join host,
Leonard Watt, to discuss

"in a fire fight just outside of Kandahar."

716

I'm sorry.

GOODWIN: (ECHOING) Captain?

718
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:11,293
Sean? Talk to me.

719
00:47:11,363 --> 00:47:13,263
Captain?

720
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:17,234
Captain Stevens,
my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin.

721
00:47:17,302 --> 00:47:20,237
You're with Operation Beleaguered Castle.
You're safe.

722
00:47:23,642 --> 00:47:24,631
Hey, this guy's crashing!

723
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:26,504
(RAPID BEEPING)

724
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:31,173
GOODWIN: Captain, just tell me what you see.
Just look and speak.

725
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:33,012
COLTER: I see a card.

726
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,278
GOODWIN: That's good.

727
00:47:36,488 --> 00:47:39,150
COLTER: Do you copy?
We are taking a lot of RPG fire here.

728
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:40,316
GOODWIN: That's very good.

729
00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:52,861
Am I dead?

730
00:47:59,811 --> 00:48:02,905
A radio listing is saying that I died
in a helicopter crash, in country,

731
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:04,107
and my father received a medal for me.

732
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:05,774
Your condition's not the issue here.

733
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,549
You need to focus on preventing
any subsequent attack.

734
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,178
Everything else is irrelevant.

735
00:48:10,855 --> 00:48:13,415
A news report saying that I'm dead
is irrelevant?

736
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:18,185
Until the person or persons
who blew up that train are in custody, yes.

737
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:21,193
Goodwin,

738
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,029
one soldier to another, am I dead?

739
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:39,850
Part of your brain remains activated.

740
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:44,212
What about the rest of me?
I can see my hands and my feet.

741
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:45,415
They still move.

742
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:47,647
They are a manifestation.

743
00:48:47,726 --> 00:48:50,092
They're just your way of making sense
of all this.

744
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:54,921
So, what are you saying?
Are you saying that I'm imagining this?

745
00:48:56,167 --> 00:49:00,263
I'm imagining that I'm still alive,
that I'm in this capsule?

746
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,410
MAN: We have core temp dropping.

(RUMBLING)

748
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:38,666
Captain, what just happened?

749
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:46,575
I asked you a question.

750
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:47,845
(SIGHS)

751
00:49:48,787 --> 00:49:52,154
The capsule is a manifestation as well.

752
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:54,282
Where am I?

753
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:56,115
That's classified.

754
00:49:57,395 --> 00:49:58,521
Fuck you!

755
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,336
Captain, I cannot imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

756
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:10,499
But if we're to prevent a second attack,
we need to send you back immediately.

757
00:50:10,575 --> 00:50:14,011
And, Captain,
you cannot deviate from the mission

758
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,307
while inside the source code,

759
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,745
even to investigate your...

760
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:20,150
Even to investigate what happened to you.

761
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:23,945
There's only one continuum on this end
and it can't be unsettled.

762
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:27,884
Well, you know what? I did unsettle it.
I called you from the train.

763
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,893
Just before the explosion,
so at 7:46 this morning,

764
00:50:31,963 --> 00:50:35,524
- they paged you with a call from me.
- You may have made that call from the train,

765
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,400
but I would never receive it here.
It's a different reality, Captain.

766
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:40,938
If the call even went through,

767
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:44,099
it would be received
by a different me entirely.

768
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:50,307
This may be difficult for you to hear,
but you are a hand on a clock, understand?

769
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:53,475
We set you, you move forward.
We reset you, you move again.

770
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:57,043
And that represents the entirety
of your function here.

771
00:50:57,122 --> 00:50:58,783
You know what?
Next time I'll send you a pizza!

772
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:00,547
I'll see if that makes an impression!

773
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:05,255
You cannot alter the continuum
of this reality from within the source code.

774
00:51:05,864 --> 00:51:07,126
This can't be legal, what you're doing.

775
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:10,725
In fact, your acquisition by this program
as well as the program itself

776
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:13,464
has been reviewed and sanctioned
by military court.

777
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:20,337
Many soldiers would find this
preferable to death.

778
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:23,869
The opportunity to continue
serving their country.

779

(STAMMERS)

780
00:51:25,717 --> 00:51:29,278
Have you spent much time in battle, sir? Huh?

781
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:31,416
That's immaterial.

782
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,750
Any soldier I've ever served with would say
that one death is service enough.

783
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:40,128
Fine. You can have that in return
for completing this mission.

784
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,429
- Have what?
- I'll give you what you want.

785
00:51:43,835 --> 00:51:46,463
Terminate your service. Let you die.

786
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:50,830
This is taking too long.

787
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:53,370
You've been too easy on him.
No more rest periods.

788
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:59,176
I am certain we can find other servicemen

789
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,480
with wounds similar to yours
who would consider

790
00:52:01,553 --> 00:52:03,817
being a part of this program an honor.

791
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:06,980
What? No, wait, what?

792
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:09,182
Send him back.

793
00:52:10,195 --> 00:52:11,287
Charge the drivers.

794
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:19,331
And Captain Stevens,
I'd like you to remember

795
00:52:19,404 --> 00:52:22,271
that it's not only about you,
but it's also about

796
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,969
two million real-world Americans.
Now, you may not value your own life,

797
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:28,939
I do, however, ask that you value theirs.

798

Calm yourself. You're back.
Did you find the bomber?

802

He's not gonna send me back in,
is he, Goodwin?

(SIGHS) I'm still waiting on an answer.

967
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:00,451
Are you married, Captain?

968
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,050
Um...

969

-You deserve to celebrate.
-Sure.

No, I'm fine.

974

Why? Are you asking me on a date?

975

Sorry. Poor taste.

- Are you married?
- Hmm?

977
01:06:22,513 --> 01:06:23,537
No.

978
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:25,871
I am divorced.

979
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:30,582
Do you think
there's an alternate version of you?

980
01:06:31,255 --> 01:06:32,950
A Goodwin who made different choices?

981
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:35,785
What do you mean?

982
01:06:36,393 --> 01:06:39,794
Like, a you who didn't get married
and get divorced.

983
01:06:39,863 --> 01:06:42,093
Or just married someone else.

984
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,394
A woman who took
a different fork in the road.

985

No, I don't, Captain.

986

What you experienced was a shadow.

987
01:06:54,712 --> 01:06:57,704
It was an afterimage of a victim on a train.

988

to alter the past.

It was designed to affect the future.
And you've done that.

992
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,561
I missed something, Captain.

993
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:20,898
That train shouldn't have blown up.

994
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:22,461
There must have been a second detonator,

995

It's a computer program, Captain.

997

The girl on the train, all the others,
they're lost.

998
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:35,317
I'm sorry about that.

we told Captain Stevens

1060
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:29,979
that we were gonna let him die.

1061
01:12:31,048 --> 01:12:32,538
Let him die?

1062
01:12:32,983 --> 01:12:35,315
He just saved millions of lives today.

1063

How many other disasters
might he avert down the line?
