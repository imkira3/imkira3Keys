CARRUTHERS: I'm telling you something...

3
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:58,605
You've got to be careful when
you're doing your stakeouts.

4
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,905
I did one for... I was
on one for six months.

5
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:03,575
I gained, like, 20, 25 pounds.
You keep eating this crap...

6
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:06,885
Well, that's my problem, though.
I don't gain weight. I tried.

7
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:08,615
That's 'cause you're 12 years old.

8
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:09,945
Yeah, well, then, who gives a shit?

9
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:11,545
Can I get you something to drink?

10
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,185
You're disgusting.

11
00:01:13,284 --> 00:01:15,786
Come on, don't keep it by the water either.

12
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,997
Don't even let it rub shoulders
with the other bottle.

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,959
Do you know what?
Urine is good for your skin.

14
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:27,048
My grandmother... I swear to God,
my grandmother told me.

15
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:31,594
She said... She did, 'cause when
I used to get a zit or something, she said...

16
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:33,221
She pissed on your face?

17
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:35,847
Get the fuck out of here.
Are you fucking nuts?

18
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:37,891
- What?
- It's my grandmother!

19
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:40,936
You just told me your grandma said
that piss is good for your skin.

20
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,145
Have some respect. Come on.

21
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,772
STEVE ON RADIO:
We have some activity here.

22
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:49,444
Why don't you speak a little louder, Steve?
Just keep it fucking down.

23
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,238
What, now?
- The old man's in bed.

24
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,990
The nurse is in there
and then Serna is somewhere in the house.

25
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:56,826
- Who's in the back? Who's in the back? Joe.
- Joe.

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,204
Joe, are you guys seeing anything?

27
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:02,165
Because if you are,
it's certainly not coming up here in the van

28
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:04,376
and we'd certainly like
to see what's going on.

29
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,836
We've been here for 16 hours.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,005
It's pretty dead.

31
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:11,675
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

32
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:16,471
All right well, just stay awake, guys.
Stay on it. Stay alert.

33
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:19,432
AGENT 1: Hey, yo, Mike,
where are you, man? I can't see you now.

34
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:20,850
Are you nervous?

35
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:23,645
What?

36
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:26,481
- What kind of deodorant do you use?
- I don't use deodorant.

37
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:28,567
- Look at you.
- What? I live in a van.

38
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,859
What does that mean?

39
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,820
It's bad for you. It causes Alzheimer's.

40
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:32,988
What?

41
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,490
Alzheimer's. You get Alzheimer's
if you're using antiperspirant

42
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:36,658
with aluminium.

43
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,702
I'm sorry. I forgot. I don't remember
what you said. What?

44
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:40,036
Fucking asshole.

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,832
Watch it. Watch it.
Watch who your superior is, pal.

46
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:52,465
STEVE: Serna just picked up
the house phone.

47
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:54,509
AGENT 2: He's on the phone now.
He is on the phone. He's on the phone.

48
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:56,219
AGENT 1: I got some movement in there.

49
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:59,097
Ricky, pan to the right and zoom in.

50
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,225
Okay, we got him. We got him. We got him.

51
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,476
Here we go. Here we go.

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,895
Zoom back in and stay there.

53
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,397
STEVE: He is on the phone. Do you guys
have any transmission? He's on the phone.

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,690
Quiet, quiet. We got it.

55
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,734
- He's talking to someone right now.
- Just keep zooming in.

56
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,819
- SERNA: Buzz.
- Dialogue hot. Dialogue hot.

57
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:16,155
Everybody off the walkies now.
Everybody off air.

58
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,448
You got clicks?

59
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,452
PADICHE: Clicks? No.
Nothing on my end. The line's clean.

60
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,078
STEVE: Do you guys have
any signal out there?

61
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,581
Yeah, we got it. Please stay off the walkies.

62
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,375
STEVE: Buzzy, I'm upstairs. I can't talk
very loud. Primo's downstairs.

63
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,295
PADICHE: I've been sitting by this phone
for 20 fucking hours.

64
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,131
STEVE: Now listen to me, Buzzy.
He's going to clip Israel.

65
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,674
Clip? He's gonna kill him?

66
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:36,842
Buddy Israel?

67
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:39,637
Now, I was eavesdropping,
so let me lay this thing out neat.

68
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,805
All right, I'm listening. Go ahead.

69
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,976
Now, what I heard downstairs is
they got a guy. Some Swede.

70
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,186
Swede.

71
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,772
- You know a Swede? You know of a Swede?
- Nothing.

72
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:53,234
Supposedly, a specialist.
And he ain't coming cheap.

73
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:58,614
So I'm thinking we jump, get to Israel before
the Swede can, we're in a power position.

74
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,449
- We grab him...
- It's a double-cross.

75
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,117
...ransom him back, pick up that nut.

76
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,203
We're that much closer to
doing our own thing.

77
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,538
Kidnapping? Can we bring this off?

78
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,959
Hey, we keep our mouth shut, play the part,
nobody suspects a thing.

79
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,169
The old man's on the fade, Buzzy.
Fuck them, you know.

80
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,672
These guys got balls. Let me tell you.
These guys got some balls.

81
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,839
Do they ever.

82
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,424
Jesus Christ, this is our time now.

83
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,177
You think they'll really
kick ransom for Israel?

84
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,971
You ain't heard the punch line.

85
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:25,640
But before I get to it, one more thing.
I should probably bring it up.

86
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,475
Primo wants Israel's heart.

87
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,688
- What'd he just say?
- He's going to cut his heart out.

88
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,648
His heart? Jesus, what for?

89
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,651
He's been snitching to the world.
I can't even blame Primo.

90
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,195
You know, he's old-school Sicilian.
This is how they hate.

91
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,864
Now, big concern for me, at least,
we crew up.

92
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,618
Let's not fuck around. Someone's cousin,
some zip off the boat from Naples.

93
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,869
Zip off the boat?

94
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,163
Let's get pros. People who know
how to behave.

95
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,415
This thing's gonna blow up huge.

96
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,543
You know, there's a pair of broads
I think might be very good for this.

97
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,752
Which broads?

98
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,546
They're reliable? They're good? What?

99
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,425
Two of the best. They hit those Chinamen,
took out the big triad.

100
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:04,554
These girls are worth every penny.
I'll call Loretta. She handles both of them.

101
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,472
All right.
Odds are they're gonna get into some shit.

102
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,640
Might have to put people down.

103
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,058
These guys aren't fucking around.

104
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,395
PADICHE: Well, just so I get a quote
in my head, how much is the Swede getting?

105
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,813
That's the punch line. You ready?

106
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,023
Here's the punch line.

107
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,566
One million flat.

108
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,359
Holy shit.

109
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,070
If word hits the street
that there's a million-dollar bounty

110
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,780
for Buddy fucking Israel,

111
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,284
you're gonna have every fucking hit man
in the free world looking for him.

112
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,704
We got to move quickly. No more tomorrow.
I got to go, Buzzy.

113
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,956
- He said one million.
- One million.

114
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,625
One million, plus the fucking heart.

115
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,169
- Plus the heart.
- And Buddy Israel.

116
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,881
Holy shit.

117
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,425
These guys want him bad.

118
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,345
Ladies and gentlemen, there's a guy,

119
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,014
he is one of the biggest stars in the world.

120
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:52,267
And we are thrilled to have him stop by.

121
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:55,270
And he's won all kinds of awards.

122
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,898
He has won Entertainer of the Year

123
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:01,193
every year in Las Vegas
for the last five years.

124
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:04,780
Ladies and gentlemen, would you give
a big round of applause,

125
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:09,701
a big Las Vegas welcome,
to a great Las Vegas star

126
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:13,163
and his name is Mr Buddy Israel!

127
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,998
Come on out here!

128
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:18,585
DUPREE: Buddy "Aces" Israel.

129
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,964
Card sharp. Illusionist.

130
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:27,970
Asshole.

131
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:31,390
I say this
from the bottom of my heart. Retire.

132
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:32,558
Douchebag.

133
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,562
Five-time Vegas Showman of the Year.

134
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:45,362
The wiseguys, for some fucking reason,
love him.

135
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:48,824
They think he's, like, a mystic.
You know, something special.

136
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,159
Nice shot.

137
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,041
Now, Buddy starts making friends.
The connected kind.

138
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,419
He's doing the Sinatra thing.

139
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,090
Becomes the unofficial mob mascot.

140
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,842
Can I whack anybody?
Who am I gonna whack?

141
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,218
Stop it. Stop it.

142
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,346
Now he's got connections. He's got pull.

143
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,347
So he starts to make plays.

144
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,892
Wants to live the mob life for real.

145
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:20,438
Bankrolls a couple of B&Es. Rich folks.

146
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:23,691
Fronts some smash-and-grabs, pawn shops,
jewellery stores, that kind of thing.

147
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,904
Then he gets his dick wet.
Strong-arm robbery.

148
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,198
Get in the van, man! Get in the van now!
Go! Go! Go!

149
00:07:33,284 --> 00:07:35,745
Vegas lounge act turns legitimate thug.

150
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,082
Truth is, Buddy don't know the fucking ball
from the bounce.

151
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,209
What do you got?

152
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:42,335
He's a wannabe.

153
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:46,505
Like most wannabes, he starts
fucking up fast and picking up speed.

154
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:50,593
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?

155
00:07:50,676 --> 00:07:53,304
That's good work. Good fucking work.
I love it.

156
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,769
His little criminal foray shines a floodlight
on the entire Carlotta organisation.

157
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:03,648
Cops get curious, they start camping out
and everything goes sideways

158
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:05,733
real fucking quick.

159
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:09,612
People get pinched, snitches snitch.

160
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:14,283
The next thing you know, Buddy Israel
has brought the heat to bear

161
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:18,079
on none other than
Mr Primo Sparazza himself.

162
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:19,455
Enforcer,

163
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:23,167
extortionist, killer.

164
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,462
Sparazza has been rumoured
to have performed

165
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:29,090
in excess of 100 contract murders,

166
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:32,885
including one of the Bureau's most
celebrated agents, Freeman Heller.

167
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:34,470
I thought Heller was a double-op?

168
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:37,973
He worked for the OSS
before joining the Bureau in its heyday.

169
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:42,102
He was the first operative assigned
with infiltrating the mob.

170
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:44,688
Fake identity, falsified backgrounds,

171
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:46,982
everything that is now
standard operating procedure,

172
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:49,442
- Heller implemented way back when.
...your attention to these overlays,

173
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:53,196
I'll show you exactly what I meant
when I said, "Change my face."

174
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,284
And as a result, his undercover work
was highly successful.

175
00:08:57,367 --> 00:09:00,829
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

176
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:03,081
I will have my ears pinned back.

177
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:07,586
Removing a slight piece of bone in my chin,
I will alter my jaw line.

178
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:12,007
Eventually, he reached the rank of capo
inside the Carlotta crime family,

179
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,719
but due to some internal slipup,
his cover was compromised.

180
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:18,638
Primo Sparazza was given the contract
to kill him.

181
00:09:20,348 --> 00:09:22,642
Sparazza is a bit of a spectre.

182
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:27,022
Over the years, the serious crimes with
which he was thought to be involved with,

183
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:29,566
including Heller's murder,
could never be traced back to him.

184
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,153
A dedicated viciousness
and slavish devotion to mob doctrine

185
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:35,572
had Sparazza's star on the rise.

186
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:37,824
So they relocated him to Nevada
and made him the head

187
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:38,992
of the Las Vegas Cosa Nostra.

188
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:40,118
Water.

189
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:41,703
What's his connection to Israel?

190
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:44,164
Sparazza introduced Israel to the life.

191
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:48,335
Gave him his first big break onstage,
brought him up through the ranks.

192
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:51,129
And Israel played the situation
very shrewdly.

193
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:53,965
Slowly amassing the loyalties
of Sparazza's top men,

194
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:55,550
with the idea of toppling the throne.

195
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:58,178
You know,
I've seen some stupid moves, but...

196
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:01,096
Well, you spend your life pulling rabbits
out of hats and sawing people in half,

197
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,681
anything seems possible.

198
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:05,351
Israel wanted to touch something real,
something dangerous.

199
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:09,813
But what he wound up doing was splitting
the family into dual factions.

200
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:12,900
Sparazza on one side, Israel on the other.

201
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,617
The infighting that followed drew
the interest of every investigative body

202
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,494
operating under the canopy
of the federal government.

203
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:24,703
This is it, right here.

204
00:10:24,787 --> 00:10:26,288
Presently, we have...

205
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:30,751
Sixteen state and federally-funded agencies
running concurrent criminal probes

206
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,753
on select members of La Cosa Nostra.

207
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:36,632
LOCKE: With Israel being the target
of virtually every one.

208
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:40,135
His testimony has the potential
of blowing the lid

209
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:42,638
off of what's left of La Cosa Nostra
in this country.

210
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:45,391
That alone warrants total immunity
from prosecution

211
00:10:45,474 --> 00:10:48,602
and a vanishing act
with the Witness Protection Programme.

212
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:55,985
The wiretaps on Serna and Padiche,
mention of Israel's heart?

213
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:58,320
Well, that corroborates
what we already know.

214
00:10:58,404 --> 00:10:59,488
Sparazza's health is in rapid decline

215
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:04,451
and before he dies, he is demanding
the heart of his sworn enemy.

216
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:09,707
A recently opened million-dollar escrow
account has been traced back to Sparazza.

217
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,334
That, and the mention
of this mysterious Swede

218
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:14,837
makes the contract on Israel
all the more real.

219
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,255
How real?

220
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:23,137
How about six figures for that fool?
How's that love?

221
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,222
- Bullshit.
- No, baby.

222
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:30,184
They heard about that triad hit,
the work y'all put in.

223
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:32,061
And they recognise the skills.

224
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:33,605
Now, you all want this?

225
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:36,524
- Hell, yeah.
- Well, I'm gonna get it for you.

226
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:37,901
What?

227
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,824
There it is! There it is!

228
00:11:44,908 --> 00:11:46,826
You called the right bitches
for this one, man.

229
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,998
You see? Write that shit down.

230
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:58,338
Are you saying that just because me and
baby girl here got a rep on the rise,

231
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,882
you know, we chipped some nails
on some niggas,

232
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:04,677
they want us to go in
and drop this mafioso motherfucker?

233
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:08,806
The way it works, girl. Y'all peeled
some serious caps. Word travels.

234
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,061
So, we're supposed to go in there,
bust on this punk

235
00:12:13,144 --> 00:12:14,979
and remove his heart. Is that for real?

236
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:20,026
You go in and pull him out.
That heart shit? That's just for flavour.

237
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,030
Now, I'm still trying to get the down-low
from this cat Padiche.

238
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:28,952
What we got right now
is a number and a name.

239
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:30,370
Buddy Israel.

240
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:32,622
What else did Padiche say?

241
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:35,917
He said the shit might get hot
and might get heavy.

242
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,921
I said, "Cool.
'Cause I got two of the hottest,

243
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:41,756
"heaviest bitches alive."

244
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:44,425
- Like who?
- Like Pasquale Acosta.

245
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:46,553
Blood-money mercenary.

246
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:51,265
His countrymen have dubbed him
the more dubious "El Estrago."

247
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:53,267
"The Plague."

248
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:57,312
American educated. Fluent in over
a dozen languages. Freelanced for the CIA.

249
00:12:57,813 --> 00:13:01,733
Noted for his legendary torture techniques.

250
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:13,078
When he was caught by the SAS
in Northern Ireland,

251
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:15,706
in prison he chewed off his fingertips
to the bones,

252
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:18,000
so he couldn't be printed or ID'd by Interpol.

253
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,586
Is it possible that he could be involved
in this?

254
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:25,048
A million-dollar hit fee would draw some
huge flies. And Acosta's pure mercenary.

255
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:29,970
He has a history of taking on tough kills,
and he's certainly not alone.

256
00:13:30,053 --> 00:13:32,806
- Who else?
- How about the Tremor Brothers?

257
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,644
Three of them.
Same skank mom, different deadbeat dads.

258
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:40,647
They're used for
that suicide-style, kamikaze shit.

259
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:42,441
Heard about that dinner club in Cleveland?

260
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:46,486
That got squat-fucked, shot to shit,
slashed and burned?

261
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,363
What happened?

262
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:52,326
Well, the Tremor Brothers go rip-shit riot
on the whole fucking place.

263
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:55,621
Seven dead, 28 wounded.

264
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,789
Just to get this one fucking guy.

265
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:03,462
In the course of the melee, one of them
gets shot in the neck. He passes out.

266
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:06,340
Another one catches blowback
from a jammed piece.

267
00:14:06,423 --> 00:14:07,507
He's temporarily blinded.

268
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:10,928
Third one gets a bullet lodged in his back,
he can't walk.

269
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:17,683
They're speed-freak, neo-Nazi assholes
who read and recite

270
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:20,186
Mein Kampf like it was Mother Goose.

271
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:21,812
They're meaner than shit,
they're dumber than hell

272
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:23,356
and these motherfuckers will go megaton

273
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:29,153
at the drop of a hat.

274
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:30,696
SYKES: I ain't never heard of him.
WATTERS: Me, neither.

275
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:35,243
Then listen up, 'cause he may wind up
being your main competition.

276
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:39,205
His name is Soot. Lazlo Soot.

277
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:45,211
A lot of folks want this white boy clapped.
Word is Soot is working for one of them.

278
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:50,341
Now, they don't know where he's from,
how long he's been in the game,

279
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,218
or even what he looks like.

280
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:56,806
But when Soot decides to move
on somebody,

281
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:01,727
they're the last ones to see it coming.

282
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:38,555
DUPREE: So, there it is.

283
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:42,517
The bond on Buddy Israel expires
in 18 hours. After that, it's a jump ball.

284
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,436
Who posted the bond?

285
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,439
Same guys who hired me,
his former law firm.

286
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:50,066
He walked out the door after he made bail.
Hasn't been seen since.

287
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,654
If this Israel really is the great white whale
of snitches,

288
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:58,116
then what are we doing messing
with the mob, who are,

289
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,871
correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they're
going to pour boxes of bullets into his ass?

290
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:03,997
Here we go.

291
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,082
What incentive is there to track him

292
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,336
on something as small time
as a fucking skip trace?

293
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:10,795
I take it you're not going.

294
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,548
No, I'm gonna go into Kentucky

295
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:15,634
and take Fort Knox
with a fucking slingshot,

296
00:16:15,717 --> 00:16:17,260
and after that I'm gonna go
into hell after Hitler.

297
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:20,764
Would you please find your fangs,
you fucking coward,

298
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:24,142
and get with this? What is wrong with you?

299
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:27,187
Seriously. What is wrong with you?

300
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:31,858
Listen, I know where Israel is, okay?

301
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:35,862
So we have maybe a day

302
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:38,240
before that location that I know

303
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:41,493
gets grapevined and
the whole fucking world gets hip to this.

304
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:44,079
He's in Lake Tahoe on the Nevada side.

305
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:45,872
We got to lay something out, though.

306
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:48,166
You go up in there ad-libbing and shit,
it's your ass.

307
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,086
- What are we talking on the split?
- Forty-five a piece for you two.

308
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:52,712
Ten percent finder's fee for me.

309
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:55,257
- So, what's the time frame?
- Fast as we can get you there.

310
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,677
We wait any longer,
someone gonna dead this fool.

311
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,844
MESSNER: Then we lose our witness.

312
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:02,138
And we lose our case.

313
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:06,225
Now, Israel's manager,
a man by the name of Morris Mecklen,

314
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:09,728
has guaranteed us that Israel will enter
into protective custody

315
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:12,648
once the government has approved his deal.

316
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:15,734
Now, we've been monitoring
Mecklen's phone calls,

317
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:18,153
and we've learnt that Israel
is at the penthouse level

318
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:22,408
of the Nomad Hotel and Casino
in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

319
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:25,578
- The high-roller suite?
- No, that's the last place they'd look.

320
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:28,581
Israel's lawyers were left holding
the bag after he skipped bail.

321
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:32,418
And Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners,
has learnt of his whereabouts.

322
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:35,838
And he's dispatched a local bondsman
by the name of Jack Dupree

323
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,716
to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas.

324
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,887
It's very simple, gentlemen.
We can't allow that to happen.

325
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,264
A Gulfstream is waiting
at the Reagan National Airport

326
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:48,017
to transport you to Lake Tahoe.

327
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,103
And I'll be flying to Los Angeles
to finalise Israel's deal.

328
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:55,816
No former witness against the mob
has been as crucial or as important

329
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,778
as Buddy "Aces" Israel.
He's not only essential to our case,

330
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,865
he is our case.

331
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:07,578
And understand that if an attempt
is made on his life,

332
00:18:07,661 --> 00:18:11,832
it'll be made by those
of the strictest professional calibre.

333
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:16,045
They are amoral, ruthless
and without restraint.

334
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:20,007
They must not succeed.

335
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,594
PADICHE: Sid.

336
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:27,472
SERNA: Yeah, Buzzy, I just got a call
from the mansion. The Swede has arrived.

337
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:28,681
No shit.

338
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:33,770
The old man sent for him. So get yourself
on a plane and get your ass to Lake Tahoe.

339
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:22,777
Are you fucking kidding me?

340
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:26,573
Fuck you.

341
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,583
Goodbye.

342
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,959
Good luck.

343
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:41,045
Godspeed.

344
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:43,381
- Good day, sir.
- Hey, baby.

345
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:45,967
- Don't fuck... What the...
- Where you going?

346
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:53,974
You call Mecklen?

347
00:19:55,142 --> 00:19:56,810
I got the machine.

348
00:19:57,102 --> 00:19:58,437
What did you say?

349
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:00,939
I leave message.

350
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:04,026
I know you left a message.
What did you say?

351
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:08,572
Hugo, you're staring at me
like I just asked you

352
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:10,574
for the fucking square root of something.

353
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:13,952
What did you say to Mecklen
on the little motherfucking machine?

354
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:18,498
That you were returning his call
and you were very, very concerned.

355
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:21,084
Wow, that's fantastic work, man.

356
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:23,712
You have the wisdom
of a 6,000 or 7,000-year-old man.

357
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:24,880
That's fantastic.

358
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:26,798
We don't have to fill up
the whole blackboard after all.

359
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:28,175
Do me a favour, will you?

360
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:30,636
Will you tell me what that is?

361
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:31,970
About what?

362
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:34,973
Look at the collar on that coat.
What does that look like? That stain?

363
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:43,815
I don't know. Cinnamon roll?

364
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:48,570
Is it cinnamon roll?
The cinnamon. The roll of the cinnamon?

365
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:52,449
That looks like jizz.

366
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:53,659
Yeah.

367
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:56,370
Eastern European jizz.

368
00:20:56,453 --> 00:21:02,334
That looks like some fuckhead shot his load
on a $12,000 calfskin jacket!

369
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:06,296
The twist is it's my $12,000 calfskin jacket!

370
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,175
So, you got the semen, okay,
you've got the human ejaculate

371
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:13,637
that's been allowed to soak in
for, like, 7 hours! All right?

372
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,430
Work its way into the fabric fucking fibres...

373
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:18,516
If you like, I send out.

374
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,396
To what? Incinerate?

375
00:21:24,313 --> 00:21:25,648
Hugo!

376
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:30,611
There isn't a fucking laundry detergent
or dry cleaning product

377
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:33,197
known to man that will get that clean.

378
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:36,534
Some shit, suffice it to say,
just don't wash out!

379
00:21:36,617 --> 00:21:40,246
- Do you want my apology?
- Only if you really, truly mean it.

380
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:42,039
I very sorry.

381
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:46,586
- Are you a colossal fucking idiot?
- I am, yes.

382
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:49,922
Get the phone. It's probably Mecklen.
Get Vitoli up here and start cleaning.

383
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:51,090
All right?

384
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:53,801
And please, for me, will you do one thing?

385
00:21:57,513 --> 00:21:58,764
Get out of my fucking sight.

386
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:01,142
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

387
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:05,313
We're about three miles
from the Nomad now.

388
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:09,901
SERNA ON TAPE: So do this in the next day
or so, get to Israel before the Swede can,

389
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:11,861
- we're in a power position.
- All right, we'll be awaiting word.

390
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:13,487
All right, we got time.
Want to go grab something to eat?

391
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:15,573
Yeah. Any word on this Swede?

392
00:22:15,656 --> 00:22:17,408
No, just the mention in that phone call.

393
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:20,119
There's no Swedish hit man
on anyone's radar.

394
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:21,370
Maybe he's that good.

395
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:23,456
You know, never been caught.
No criminal record. It's possible.

396
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:25,833
Maybe, but that's very unlikely.

397
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:29,378
Jesus, I'll tell you, engineering
this kind of play against Sparazza,

398
00:22:29,462 --> 00:22:33,257
going to these lengths that these two guys
are going, they're playing some long odds.

399
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:36,093
Coffee? Anything?
I don't want to order without...

400
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:37,220
No, no, we cool.

401
00:22:37,303 --> 00:22:39,930
- Coffee?
- No, no, thanks, darling. Lovely.

402
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:42,432
So, I spoke to Loretta this morning.

403
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:45,519
And she told me you, more or less,
have a plan of attack.

404
00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:49,189
My associate, Mr Serna,
I can get him on the phone

405
00:22:49,272 --> 00:22:52,275
and if you could just speak to him
and tell him your plan...

406
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:56,988
- Your plans. What you got in mind?
- Pussy.

407
00:22:58,907 --> 00:22:59,991
I'm sorry?

408
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:01,576
Pussy.

409
00:23:02,285 --> 00:23:03,620
Pushy?

410
00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:07,457
Pussy.

411
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,294
Yeah, Israel likes pussy.

412
00:23:11,378 --> 00:23:12,963
And we like

413
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:15,215
that he likes...

414
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:16,758
Pussy.

415
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:18,051
Correct.

416
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:19,219
Well,

417
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:21,388
enough said.

418
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:25,809
Hi, Jack. Great, good, super.
Come on in. Good to see you.

419
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:28,478
- How you doing? Pete.
- Hello. Rip Reed. Come in. Good. Good.

420
00:23:28,562 --> 00:23:30,647
Great. Come on. What's that in there...

421
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,650
Hello? Great. Come on in. Sorry about that.

422
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:36,152
- Hey, Hollis.
- Rip Reed. Hello, Hollis. Come on in.

423
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:39,322
So, Jack, he tells me you guys
a couple of ex-cops?

424
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:42,868
- Yeah, we worked vice, like, 6 years.
- Is that right?

425
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:43,994
- Four.
- Four years.

426
00:23:44,077 --> 00:23:45,161
- About six years.
- Vice.

427
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:47,873
Four, six, five. They didn't teach you
how to count, I guess, huh?

428
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:50,500
But I bet you guys
got a bunch of stories, right? I don't.

429
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:54,462
I grew up soft with the private schools
and little blazers, you know, and...

430
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:56,673
Everyone talked things out, you know?

431
00:23:56,756 --> 00:24:00,594
No one ever threw any blows.
Still to this day, never punched in the face.

432
00:24:00,677 --> 00:24:02,679
Imagine that? I'm pretty much a pantywaist.

433
00:24:02,762 --> 00:24:05,180
I don't say this to be self-deprecating.
I just, you know,

434
00:24:05,264 --> 00:24:07,808
don't have much of an opinion of myself.
I'd much rather be like you guys.

435
00:24:07,892 --> 00:24:10,811
You know, bar fighters and big,
swinging dicks, taking care of shit.

436
00:24:10,895 --> 00:24:15,399
You know, sadly, this is it.
You know, it's disgusting. Thanks, God!

437
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:20,029
Dog-pile of piss-poor physique on top of
a small cock and hereditary alcoholism.

438
00:24:20,112 --> 00:24:21,572
I appreciate it!

439
00:24:23,324 --> 00:24:25,784
I'm babbling. I do that drunk. Please forgive.

440
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:26,952
Let's get to the business at hand.

441
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:31,081
This wanted felon here, Buddy Israel,
little Rick Springfield, I guess.

442
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:34,335
And his bail-bond bobbing around
up there out at the lake.

443
00:24:34,418 --> 00:24:36,503
Rip, hand to God, you got nothing
to worry about with this.

444
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:38,088
- Yeah?
- Okay? I've assembled a team now.

445
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,798
We're gonna go in,
we're gonna get this guy,

446
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:41,467
and everyone is gonna leave
the theatre grinning.

447
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,135
No problem. Will not be a problem.
No problem.

448
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:46,138
Great, that's good. You're feeling it,
you're feeling it. Come on.

449
00:24:46,222 --> 00:24:48,182
Outstanding! Get it up there!

450
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:51,227
Come on. Come on, man. And bones it.

451
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:55,731
Huh? Right there, and then padlock it
and then you put the chain on it.

452
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:57,816
That's a new one I'm working on.

453
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,195
- Really getting the hairy eyeball off that guy.
- No, no. No, no.

454
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:02,780
- He's all right?
- He's all right. Tell him.

455
00:25:02,863 --> 00:25:06,825
This is good, though, what you're telling
me. All right? I need to hear this stuff.

456
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:08,077
Little boosts.

457
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,664
Helps allay my fears. I pass
that peace of mind along to my partners.

458
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:13,749
All right. Look up. Hey, man.
That's not yours.

459
00:25:13,832 --> 00:25:15,000
Put the fucking rabbit down.

460
00:25:15,084 --> 00:25:16,585
Appreciate it. Get your dick-beaters off it.

461
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:20,005
Couple of things.
The hangers-on, his posse, you know,

462
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:23,217
they're all strapped or packing heat,
whatever the phrase is.

463
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,094
- I don't know what you guys call it.
- Strapped.

464
00:25:25,177 --> 00:25:26,262
Strapped? Well, so, they got guns.

465
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:29,013
What else? He drinks, you know.
Self-medicates. Total cliché.

466
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:33,476
This guy. He's a strung-out, washed-up,
has-been, jerk, snitch,

467
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,645
fucking drunk, seven-layer loser.

468
00:25:35,728 --> 00:25:37,939
Right. Now I'm praying he puts up a fight!

469
00:25:38,022 --> 00:25:41,568
Please! Please, please, rape him
if it's possible!

470
00:25:41,651 --> 00:25:44,946
Punch him in the seat or something,
you know? Hit him in the brown.

471
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:49,367
I don't know. Anyway, I believe
we had a retainer for services rendered.

472
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:51,077
$50,000.

473
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,288
ISRAEL: $50,000 for this fucking suite?

474
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:56,916
- Yo, calm down.
- Don't tell me to fucking calm down!

475
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,794
- That's all they're gonna give us.
- Look at the attention we gettin', man.

476
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:03,631
We campaigning like niggas ain't hot.
We hot.

477
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:07,010
And they losing a whole floor's worth
of business, saying it's under construction.

478
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:10,054
I am not shelling out this kind of bread
for this shithole, all right?

479
00:26:10,138 --> 00:26:12,849
This is a junior suite in Vegas. So, fuck this

480
00:26:12,932 --> 00:26:14,017
and the fucking animal kingdom.

481
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,395
- What?
- Vitoli not answer the phone.

482
00:26:17,478 --> 00:26:21,774
Go down there and get him.
Go down there! Come on. Let's go.

483
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:24,319
- Has Mecklen called?
- No.

484
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:28,907
When do we get concerned?

485
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,534
We don't get concerned.
We'll see movement on this soon.

486
00:26:31,618 --> 00:26:33,870
All right? We just got to knock off
a few more hours.

487
00:26:33,953 --> 00:26:36,164
These flowers have wilted. Call the florist.

488
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:37,999
No, I need you to chill.

489
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:40,043
I need you to call the florist.

490
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:44,839
When your guy gonna call?
That's what's happening.

491
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:48,843
Hey, yo, Beanie.

492
00:26:51,095 --> 00:26:53,597
Hey, ladies. Get up.

493
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,974
Beans.

494
00:26:57,476 --> 00:27:00,145
Bag them and get some more on deck,
all right?

495
00:27:07,528 --> 00:27:08,862
All right, y'all.

496
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:10,906
We did the damn thing.

497
00:27:11,573 --> 00:27:15,077
Now proceed to the front
in an orderly fashion,

498
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:19,122
or how the fuck y'all want to,
but get the fuck going.

499
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:22,251
Let's go, step lively. Get your ass up.
Put your clothes on, girl.

500
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:26,296
You're acting like y'all on sundial.
Y'all need to be on stopwatch.

501
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,763
Damn it. I didn't realise how fucked up
I was till I just saw your ass, girl.

502
00:27:34,846 --> 00:27:38,600
You went from Beyoncé to Bigfoot
in less than six fucking hours.

503
00:27:38,684 --> 00:27:39,810
Fuck you, pussy!

504
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:43,272
Hey, we did that dance, bitch. Kick rocks.

505
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:45,274
Goddamn!

506
00:27:45,357 --> 00:27:48,569
Hey, yo, is this Madame Alex?

507
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:50,445
Hey, y'all got sick leave?

508
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:53,282
'Cause one of your hoes just got fucked up!

509
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:55,325
Yeah, she might be missing some work.

510
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:59,955
Oh, hell, no! This is nice.
This is real nice! Play it up!

511
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:02,749
What you doing, girl?
Come on, man. Come on.

512
00:28:04,877 --> 00:28:06,753
- Hoes gotta go.
- Get them out of here. Let's go!

513
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:08,755
Get them to the elevator.

514
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:11,216
- GIRL: Fuck you! Give me my purse!
- Shut the fuck up!

515
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,760
Hey, bitch! You forgot your hat!

516
00:28:13,844 --> 00:28:17,513
- Get your hands off me, asshole!
- Take your shit, bitch.

517
00:28:18,014 --> 00:28:20,975
Thanks, Paul. Israel's awake.

518
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:25,104
There was apparently a fight
with some prostitutes,

519
00:28:25,188 --> 00:28:26,230
but he wasn't involved.

520
00:28:26,314 --> 00:28:28,482
- What, like an actual fight? They...
- Yeah, a fight.

521
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:31,194
- Jesus Christ.
- A scuffle, a donnybrook. Yeah.

522
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:35,281
He had one of his men call a madam
for another group of girls.

523
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:36,782
- We're getting robbed here, man.
- Seriously.

524
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:38,117
Three days staring at Sparazza's house.

525
00:28:38,201 --> 00:28:40,912
This guy's got hookers
up there fistfighting.

526
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:42,955
Look at all you're missing.

527
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,499
Have you checked this stuff out yet?
This is unbelievable.

528
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:48,377
You know that Sparazza's had
major elective plastic surgery.

529
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:49,503
Fifteen of them. Right?

530
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:51,756
Fifteen separate procedures since 1952.

531
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:52,924
Look at the work he's had done.

532
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:56,344
Nose, three times. Eyes. Eyelids. Jaw.

533
00:28:56,427 --> 00:28:58,262
You take every has-been actor in Hollywood,

534
00:28:58,346 --> 00:28:59,805
- they haven't been cut this much.
- Easy.

535
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:02,099
Crazy, you know.
Wall-to-wall felony offences.

536
00:29:02,183 --> 00:29:06,020
Murder, of course. Extortion.
Arson. Grand larceny. Blah, blah, blah.

537
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:09,106
And a paternity suit, just to,
you know, round out the portfolio there.

538
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,317
And not one single criminal charge
laid against him.

539
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,320
Well, you can't kill over a hundred people
without knowing how to tiptoe.

540
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:16,989
Yeah, but the Bureau knows he killed Heller.

541
00:29:17,114 --> 00:29:18,491
Then why not go after him for that?

542
00:29:18,574 --> 00:29:20,493
Heller was buried by the agency.

543
00:29:20,576 --> 00:29:24,330
Any time an operative failed, or was
perceived to have failed, he was blackballed.

544
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:25,498
Look at what happened to Ness.

545
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:27,542
Ness and the Untouchables
took down Capone.

546
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,710
Heller got shot and killed.
The bad guys beat him.

547
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:32,421
Worse, Sparazza walked.
How much longer you think?

548
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:34,840
Who knows? Locke has been
with the lawyers from Justice

549
00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:36,008
since yesterday afternoon.

550
00:29:36,092 --> 00:29:39,804
Israel's manager is acting as his attorney.
That's what's holding things up.

551
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:43,181
So I want to be in that penthouse
a half a second after this deal is done.

552
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:44,850
We gonna get any guff from the hotel staff?

553
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:46,184
Israel's obviously paid them off.

554
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:48,353
We're not gonna have any trouble
with the hotel staff.

555
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:51,356
You show them your ID
with the letters "FBI" in all caps,

556
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:53,900
it's instant compliance.
I've seen it happen a hundred times.

557
00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:58,613
Special Agent Gerald Diego, Federal Bureau
of Investigation, San Francisco Field Office.

558
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:01,366
We're conducting a series
of impromptu inspections

559
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:02,617
for the Nevada Gaming Commission,

560
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,244
and I'd like to speak
with your head of security.

561
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:07,831
Okay, just one second.
Just hang on, sir.

562
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:19,593
Where'd you get these?

563
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,013
Same place that rents to the guards.

564
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:25,223
All right, there's a shift change at 9:00 a. M.

565
00:30:25,307 --> 00:30:29,186
The graveyard gets off. We're gonna slip in
with the daytime guys when they go on.

566
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:32,314
But what about access cards, passkeys?

567
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,941
Yeah, well, we'll get our hands on those
when we get inside.

568
00:30:35,025 --> 00:30:36,651
Basically, there's two security levels, okay?

569
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:39,487
You got your casino-floor,
count-room surveillance,

570
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,740
then you got your general security.

571
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:44,576
But I guess your friend
don't want to hear this.

572
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:49,456
Hollis? Come on. Get the fuck out of the car.
Come on. Come on.

573
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:52,584
- How about we put a gun to your head?
- We've been through that already.

574
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,879
Well, then quit acting like someone
took a shit in your cereal bowl, all right?

575
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:57,839
Reed paid us 50 grand.

576
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:59,549
What am I doing? Am I standing here?

577
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:01,885
- Am I standing here?
- Your attitude is fucking horrible.

578
00:31:01,968 --> 00:31:03,053
- It's embarrassing.
- All right. Cut it out.

579
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:04,471
Two security levels.

580
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:08,432
The one we're going in
under the guise of is general hotel security.

581
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:10,768
They're basically
in charge of standing around the lobby

582
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:12,686
with their dicks in their hands,
you know what I mean?

583
00:31:16,982 --> 00:31:21,111
There's a 35-person employee contingent
that goes at 9:00 in the morning.

584
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:24,240
We're gonna break up, split apart,
blend in with them

585
00:31:24,323 --> 00:31:26,200
and reconnoiter at the hotel.

586
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:14,748
Come here! Get over here!

587
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,730
You stay down! You stay down!
Do you hear what I'm saying?

588
00:32:45,361 --> 00:32:48,031
I forgive you, Darwin.

589
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:52,202
Shoot, I appreciate that, man.

590
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:58,124
If I needed your car and me and my brothers
were wanted by the law,

591
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:00,501
I would've killed you to get it, too.

592
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:02,587
You would've?

593
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,339
Hell, yeah.

594
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:09,219
We's just at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

595
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:11,804
So don't feel so bad, chief.

596
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,391
Oh, damn.

597
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:19,187
All right, then.

598
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,898
You know, up here in heaven, it's beautiful.

599
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,444
Really?

600
00:33:27,153 --> 00:33:29,322
I'll see you up here someday.

601
00:33:30,406 --> 00:33:31,908
You think so?

602
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:36,454
I know so.

603
00:33:51,094 --> 00:33:52,554
Small world.

604
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:02,980
All right, enough grab-assing, goddamn it!

605
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:06,733
Grab them suits and the car.

606
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:09,778
And pitch them poor fellas in the lake.

607
00:34:11,446 --> 00:34:14,116
And y'all follow me over to the hotel.

608
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:23,584
Yeah, you want some of me?
Yeah, just wait till we get outside!

609
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:24,877
Let go of me!

610
00:34:26,587 --> 00:34:28,797
Let go of my arm!

611
00:34:30,674 --> 00:34:32,050
Shut up! Fuck off!

612
00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:34,887
That's gonna be real incognito
going in like that.

613
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,471
This is real brilliant. You're brilliant.

614
00:34:36,555 --> 00:34:38,265
- Okay, why don't you just chill for now?
- Whatever.

615
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:39,933
Would you like two beds in your room?

616
00:34:40,017 --> 00:34:42,186
No, no, we're not together. No.

617
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:46,607
Come on, baby. Don't be shy.
Just one bed, please.

618
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,151
- Hey!
- Come on, baby.

619
00:34:49,234 --> 00:34:51,737
You know I'm playing with your pretty ass.

620
00:34:52,154 --> 00:34:53,405
Let me ask you a question.

621
00:34:53,488 --> 00:34:55,616
Y'all really let hoochies like that
stay up in here?

622
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,285
I mean, 'cause y'all must be burning sheets
by the ton.

623
00:34:58,368 --> 00:34:59,411
Well...

624
00:34:59,494 --> 00:35:02,331
As a female, that shit right there
don't get you?

625
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:06,710
Okay, it's bitches like that the reason
why niggas don't pay our species any mind!

626
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:10,047
They don't respect us!
Yeah, we just meat for male consumption.

627
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,798
Pieces of ass and pussy.

628
00:35:11,882 --> 00:35:14,593
Something pretty in lipstick and eyeliner
that can suck a fucking cock!

629
00:35:14,676 --> 00:35:16,512
- My ass!
- Shut up. What do you have to shout for?

630
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:18,346
She's asleep!
I'm trying to wake this bitch up! Man!

631
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:20,556
Come here! Come here!

632
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,560
Bitches like that
make me weep for what could be.

633
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:28,356
If we all sisters everywhere, black, white,
brown and yellow,

634
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:29,690
put our shit down one time,

635
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:33,194
a unified front, you know, the female race,

636
00:35:33,277 --> 00:35:37,281
mobilised, baby, moving as one!
You feel me?

637
00:35:37,365 --> 00:35:38,950
I'm gonna need a minibar key, too.

638
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:49,710
MAN ON TAPE RECORDER: Say your name.
Then say, "How can I be of assistance?"

639
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:52,088
VITOLl: I don't understand.

640
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:55,174
I didn't ask for your understanding.

641
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:58,094
I asked for your name,
followed by the phrase,

642
00:35:58,177 --> 00:36:00,888
"How can I be of assistance?"

643
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:04,892
My name is Vitoli.
How can I be of assistance?

644
00:36:04,976 --> 00:36:06,269
Bravo.

645
00:36:10,064 --> 00:36:13,734
My name is Vitoli.
How can I be of assistance?

646
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:26,622
My name is Vitoli.
How can I be of assistance?

647
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:32,003
My name is Vitoli.
How can I be of assistance?

648
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:41,262
My name is Vitoli.
How can I be of assistance?

649
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:46,183
Vitoli!

650
00:36:47,642 --> 00:36:48,768
Vitoli!

651
00:36:49,102 --> 00:36:52,230
Let's go! What, your phone broke or what?

652
00:36:53,648 --> 00:36:55,817
Buddy wants you now up top.

653
00:36:57,652 --> 00:37:00,071
Where are you, you big nut?

654
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:02,782
Vitoli!

655
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:04,451
Come on, bitchy bitch.

656
00:37:05,952 --> 00:37:08,455
You open the fucking door.

657
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:13,043
Come on!

658
00:37:57,629 --> 00:37:59,881
ISRAEL: No, I tell you something.
You know what? Listen to me. Listen.

659
00:37:59,965 --> 00:38:03,760
The deal is off in five minutes
unless they give us something.

660
00:38:03,844 --> 00:38:05,679
MECKLEN: I don't know what to say to you.
It is what it is.

661
00:38:05,762 --> 00:38:07,388
- Bullshit! It isn't!
- Listen...

662
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:10,850
I am not... I don't know how to say it
any fucking louder, Morrie.

663
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:12,101
I am not giving up my boys.

664
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:14,186
- And they are bricking us...
- All right? End of fucking song.

665
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,397
...on that particular issue, pally.

666
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,026
I've been cohabitating with these people
for the last 30 hours.

667
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,614
These are the premier prick cocksuckers
of all time.

668
00:38:25,698 --> 00:38:28,617
And I feel beaten by them. I feel bloodied.

669
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:30,327
You're just gonna have to play ball.

670
00:38:30,411 --> 00:38:33,622
No, I don't have to do shit, which includes
cooperating with these fuckers,

671
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:35,374
until I get what I want!

672
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:41,380
Listen to me.
If we have to give them someone,

673
00:38:41,463 --> 00:38:44,341
give them Hugo, all right?

674
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,721
I can take that because he needs that
regimented prison shit that they'll give him.

675
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:51,974
It's bigger than that. They want everybody.

676
00:38:52,516 --> 00:38:55,186
Ivy, Beanie, Hugo, the works.

677
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,023
This is not a fucking swap meet,
all right, Morrie?

678
00:39:00,232 --> 00:39:02,026
I'm not giving up my boys
and you fucking know that.

679
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:03,194
I gave you Sparazza.

680
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:05,905
I'm gonna give them Sparazza
and the west-coast syndicate gift-wrapped.

681
00:39:05,988 --> 00:39:07,489
Get it fucking done!

682
00:39:07,573 --> 00:39:12,077
Listen to me, kid.
Let's not antagonise this any more, okay?

683
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:15,956
If we push this,
they are gonna revoke your protective status

684
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,250
and that nullifies any agreement we got.

685
00:39:18,334 --> 00:39:20,669
And that is mate. Checkmate, kiddo.

686
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:55,203
All right.

687
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,562
- Israel rolled!
- He's giving them all up, isn't he?

688
00:40:20,645 --> 00:40:23,690
His entire entourage. He doesn't have
a friend in the world. We got to move.

689
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:25,525
Son of a bitch. The Justice lawyers sign off?

690
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:27,735
Yeah, that's happening.
Look, if he's gonna run,

691
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:28,945
he's gonna run now, so we got to go!

692
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:31,823
I'm gonna call security and make sure
the whole place is locked down.

693
00:40:31,906 --> 00:40:33,491
We got to keep him in that penthouse.

694
00:40:33,575 --> 00:40:35,827
ACOSTA: I'd like to take a look
at the penthouse.

695
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,873
No, I'm sorry, the penthouse
is currently under construction.

696
00:40:39,956 --> 00:40:41,791
MAN ON RADIO: Do a sweep
on camera three. Maybe we can pick him up.

697
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:45,628
Bill, can I speak to you privately?

698
00:40:45,837 --> 00:40:47,130
If you get a chance...

699
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:51,426
Gary? Let's get our personnel up
on the catwalk over 12.

700
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:53,428
I don't like the rolls
that table's been getting.

701
00:40:53,511 --> 00:40:54,846
It's tough, huh?

702
00:40:55,263 --> 00:40:57,639
This is tough. I don't know... This...
I don't know how you do this.

703
00:40:57,723 --> 00:40:59,516
I mean,
you have to keep your eye on everything.

704
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,351
And everybody all the time.

705
00:41:01,435 --> 00:41:03,562
- Yeah, it can be a chore.
- I'll bet.

706
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:05,355
So, Bill, if I'm getting this right,

707
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:08,358
so you currently have the penthouse level
under construction?

708
00:41:08,442 --> 00:41:09,610
- That's correct.
- Okay.

709
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:14,239
But with these down,
doesn't that pose a major security concern?

710
00:41:14,323 --> 00:41:17,201
I mean, as you said, you got to keep
your eye on everything at all times.

711
00:41:17,284 --> 00:41:19,578
Well, we were worried
about the dust and debris from the work

712
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:21,496
going on up there ruining the cameras.

713
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,123
- So you shut them off?
- Yes.

714
00:41:23,207 --> 00:41:27,753
Hey, Bill, you said there's some situation
on 12? It's table 12?

715
00:41:27,836 --> 00:41:31,089
Table 12. Okay?
I need somebody over at table 12.

716
00:41:31,173 --> 00:41:35,636
A little blue-haired lady there
who's rolled about 14 times. Thank you.

717
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:37,888
Something happened at table 14?

718
00:41:39,306 --> 00:41:40,557
Table 12!

719
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:42,351
I got it.

720
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:45,812
You shut them off.

721
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:48,440
Yes. I mean, no, we...

722
00:41:48,524 --> 00:41:52,444
There's personnel stationed at both ends
of that hallway 24 hours a day.

723
00:41:52,528 --> 00:41:54,154
Okay. What kind of personnel?

724
00:41:54,238 --> 00:41:55,572
Right now?

725
00:41:56,073 --> 00:42:02,079
A six-man security force plus Vitoli,
our executive butler, so seven men, total.

726
00:42:02,162 --> 00:42:04,665
You have an executive butler on the floor?

727
00:42:04,748 --> 00:42:07,876
Just in terms
of the men that are up there now, my team,

728
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:12,923
serving lunch and dinner
and just generally doing upkeep.

729
00:42:13,006 --> 00:42:15,801
I'm not clear on the table. Is it table...
I'm at 12.

730
00:42:15,884 --> 00:42:18,637
I don't know what you're seeing
right now, Bill.

731
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:23,182
It's a little blue-haired lady.
I'm looking at her right now. Table 12!

732
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:27,061
She is killing it, all right?
I want you to keep an eye on her! That's all!

733
00:42:27,353 --> 00:42:30,481
- It's got to be frustrating.
- Copy that. We got her now.

734
00:42:30,898 --> 00:42:33,734
- No guests, though, on the penthouse?
- No.

735
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:35,069
We have noticed a lot of action
on that table.

736
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,738
- Come on, Bill.
- We just want to know what's going on.

737
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:40,783
You got some sultan.

738
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:45,162
- One of your whales.
- No.

739
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:47,290
Big spender? Come on.

740
00:42:47,373 --> 00:42:48,624
- No, no.
- Likes a lot of space?

741
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:50,710
Did you cook up
this little construction thing?

742
00:42:50,793 --> 00:42:51,836
- Is this a...
- No, no.

743
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:55,089
We've been looking to renovate
that area of our hotel for some time now.

744
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:58,009
The security in place
is solely to preserve floor integrity.

745
00:42:58,301 --> 00:43:00,136
And who else has access to the floor, Bill?

746
00:43:02,597 --> 00:43:05,516
I'm sorry. We're covering
some very sensitive material here,

747
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,685
and I've got to safeguard myself,

748
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:10,646
so if you could just show me
your ID again, get your clearance.

749
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,023
Of course, great. If you could just tell me

750
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:13,941
who has access to the floor,
I think we could...

751
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:18,154
I have the sole pass and relieve
all of the personnel myself personally.

752
00:43:18,237 --> 00:43:20,781
- Now, if we can just see your ID...
- Absolutely.

753
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,579
Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?
I need to speak to security right away.

754
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:31,667
This is Special Agent Donald Carruthers
of the FBI. Hello? Is anyone there? Hello?

755
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:36,172
Is that

756
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:38,299
blood?

757
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:40,218
Yes, it is.

758
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:43,554
It's filling up your lungs right now.

759
00:43:44,554 --> 00:43:49,851
In less than a minute,
you're gonna asphyxiate and pass out.

760
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:53,104
But you shouldn't be feeling any pain
right now, okay?

761
00:43:55,357 --> 00:43:57,567
Hey, hey.

762
00:43:59,486 --> 00:44:00,904
Close your eyes.

763
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:06,743
Close your eyes.

764
00:44:07,744 --> 00:44:09,204
Close your eyes.

765
00:44:10,497 --> 00:44:14,960
Don't make this face
the last thing you ever see.

766
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,589
Because...

767
00:44:19,673 --> 00:44:23,426
Heaven may hold it against you.

768
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,846
Am I really dying?

769
00:44:27,472 --> 00:44:28,807
Bill.

770
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:32,143
Yeah, William.

771
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,774
We're all dying.

772
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,130
MESSNER: So it's a confirmed
double homicide.

773
00:45:00,213 --> 00:45:01,923
CARRUTHERS: Nobody from security
is picking up the line.

774
00:45:02,007 --> 00:45:04,968
Gunshot vics,
dumped in the lake, maybe an hour cold.

775
00:45:05,218 --> 00:45:06,344
You're on speakerphone.

776
00:45:06,428 --> 00:45:07,637
- AGENT: Am I on the speakerphone?
- Yeah, go, go, go, go.

777
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:09,638
We got an ID pending on a Jack Dupree.

778
00:45:09,722 --> 00:45:11,932
He's a bail bondsman
out of Las Vegas, Nevada.

779
00:45:12,016 --> 00:45:13,809
Did you recover anything from his person?

780
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:15,436
We got a receipt out of his pocket.

781
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:17,396
- It was for a uniform rental.
- What kind of uniform?

782
00:45:17,479 --> 00:45:19,315
The receipt was partially destroyed
by the lake water.

783
00:45:19,398 --> 00:45:20,566
- What kind of uniforms?
- What kind of uniforms?

784
00:45:20,649 --> 00:45:22,234
It was listed as maroon in colour.

785
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:23,819
CARRUTHERS: Maroon?
AGENT: Maroon.

786
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,615
- With maroon, that's Nomad security.
- Were these uniforms recovered?

787
00:45:27,698 --> 00:45:29,158
- No, we're still looking.
- Fuck!

788
00:45:29,241 --> 00:45:31,619
Deputy? I need you...

789
00:45:31,702 --> 00:45:34,079
I need you to lock down...
I need you to limit physical activity...

790
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:38,000
- Is that clear?
- Nobody gets in the hotel.

791
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:41,086
Nobody gets near the crime scene.
Make it happen, okay?

792
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,005
- Dupree was going in as security.
- Yep.

793
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:44,548
I'm gonna go over to the hotel.

794
00:45:44,632 --> 00:45:46,217
You take the car. You get over to the lake.

795
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,427
- You find out whatever you can.
- What are you gonna do?

796
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:50,554
I'm gonna get to Israel before they do.

797
00:45:50,638 --> 00:45:52,598
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- And why?

798
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:55,100
Because we don't need to bring any more
shit down on our heads.

799
00:45:55,184 --> 00:45:58,479
I'm saying we're gonna hit whoever's
between us and Israel. That's how I'm on it.

800
00:45:58,562 --> 00:45:59,897
I ain't trying to dead the whole floor

801
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,357
and I don't want to be killing no women.

802
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,650
No matter how they make their living.

803
00:46:02,733 --> 00:46:07,112
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm getting some
fucked-up feedback off of that earpiece.

804
00:46:09,865 --> 00:46:11,534
- That's better?
- Yeah, much.

805
00:46:11,617 --> 00:46:12,868
What you hearing right now?

806
00:46:12,952 --> 00:46:16,539
There was something about some
faggot-ass fed being up in the building.

807
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:21,085
- A fed? Like FBI?
- Yeah. That's all right though. That's cool.

808
00:46:21,168 --> 00:46:23,671
It's just some little casino inspection.
Don't trip.

809
00:46:23,754 --> 00:46:28,342
All right, then. When them tricks
hit the lobby, I want you to holler at me.

810
00:46:28,425 --> 00:46:31,262
I'm gonna meet them on their way up,
blend in real nice.

811
00:46:32,137 --> 00:46:35,890
Once I'm inside, I'm puttin' chrome
to Israel's head and backing out hot.

812
00:46:35,974 --> 00:46:37,767
Anybody get gully, you know.

813
00:46:37,851 --> 00:46:39,686
I'm gonna grip and rip.

814
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:42,897
I got some handloads up here
ready to put some niggas out. Trust me.

815
00:46:42,981 --> 00:46:46,568
Just remember it's more
of a rescue than a rampage, all right?

816
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:50,196
Hey, come on, man.
You know I had to bring big mama through.

817
00:46:51,531 --> 00:46:53,491
- You got the.50 up?
- Sure do.

818
00:46:53,575 --> 00:46:55,702
What the fuck?
What the fuck are you trying to shoot?

819
00:46:55,785 --> 00:46:56,828
A jumbo jet out of the sky?

820
00:46:56,911 --> 00:46:58,163
Blast down the moon?

821
00:46:58,246 --> 00:47:01,708
Any of these niggas make one false move,
these bitches taking dirt naps.

822
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:04,085
I ain't trying to be up here all day.
And I tell you what.

823
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:07,422
That bitch-ass fed get in the way,
RIP, nigga.

824
00:47:11,467 --> 00:47:15,930
Fucking Kevlar, the way I had to stitch it,
this shit is itchy as hell.

825
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,695
Let me ask you a question.
You heard from that nigga, Keith?

826
00:47:30,778 --> 00:47:33,281
Or he still fucking
with that little light-skinned girl?

827
00:47:33,364 --> 00:47:35,825
I ain't trying to break a sweat off
of that motherfucker.

828
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:37,994
Yeah, fuck that nigga, man.

829
00:47:38,077 --> 00:47:41,289
Anyway, we got each other.
That's all the love we ever gonna need.

830
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:42,457
Feel me?

831
00:47:43,124 --> 00:47:44,959
You feel me, girl?

832
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,378
Oh, wait a minute.

833
00:47:47,879 --> 00:47:50,507
I think the ho train just arrived.

834
00:47:51,966 --> 00:47:56,179
Damn! Four skank-ass bitches.
That's your crew.

835
00:47:56,262 --> 00:47:57,721
Hey, fuck you. All right.

836
00:47:57,804 --> 00:48:01,642
Fuck you and this fucking wig
'cause this shit is getting on my nerves.

837
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:04,311
I'm on my way out.

838
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:10,984
I'm going to just chill in the hallway
until they come up in the elevator.

839
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:12,486
And you let me know, all right?

840
00:48:14,696 --> 00:48:17,908
You just get up in there
and do your thing, baby girl.

841
00:48:17,991 --> 00:48:21,620
Mama's got your back.
Mama's got your back, baby.

842
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:27,668
SERNA: Buzzy? Buzz?

843
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:30,504
- Yeah, it's me.
- All right, you got clicks? Anything?

844
00:48:30,587 --> 00:48:32,714
No, nothing on my end.

845
00:48:32,798 --> 00:48:35,634
- So, how we looking?
- Looks very good.

846
00:48:35,717 --> 00:48:37,344
Fucking thrilled to hear it.

847
00:48:37,427 --> 00:48:40,222
So, this sit-down, you must have felt it
from them then, huh?

848
00:48:40,305 --> 00:48:42,558
Cold blood, Sid. Dead eyes.

849
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:46,395
Okay, yeah, good. So you're at the hotel.
Everything's all right?

850
00:48:46,478 --> 00:48:47,813
It's quiet.

851
00:48:47,896 --> 00:48:49,022
So, you're not seeing anything?

852
00:48:49,106 --> 00:48:51,900
No signs of trouble, nobody lurking,
no threats? Nothing?

853
00:48:51,984 --> 00:48:54,486
Absolutely no.
We got nothing to worry about.

854
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,196
Israel's in the penthouse now, right?

855
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,740
Yeah. I guess he's been holed up there
for a week or so.

856
00:48:58,824 --> 00:49:00,826
- How are we on time?
- The Swede's been dispatched.

857
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:01,952
He's flying himself.

858
00:49:02,035 --> 00:49:05,873
All right, damn, all right.
So he's headed to Tahoe then, huh?

859
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:08,375
Yeah. We're in a bit of a footrace
right now, Buzzy.

860
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:13,005
It's a matter of who outhustles who,
you know? We just got to get to Israel first.

861
00:49:13,088 --> 00:49:14,256
It's getting done, Sid.

862
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:18,552
We got to get him, Buzz. Everything,
and I mean everything is riding on this.

863
00:49:18,635 --> 00:49:22,263
We're gonna get Israel. Trust me.

864
00:49:31,314 --> 00:49:33,900
HUGO ON RECORDER:
You open the fucking door.

865
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,608
AGENT: I'm sorry, sir.

866
00:50:15,691 --> 00:50:16,984
But this is eyes only.

867
00:50:17,068 --> 00:50:18,945
They told me to hand deliver.

868
00:50:35,127 --> 00:50:36,796
Where did this come from?

869
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:39,674
They dug it up in archives
as part of the Sparazza investigation.

870
00:50:57,941 --> 00:50:59,150
Has anyone else seen this?

871
00:50:59,234 --> 00:51:03,071
Only the Director himself.
He asked that you contact him immediately.

872
00:51:04,322 --> 00:51:07,159
Should we inform Messner and Carruthers?

873
00:51:08,827 --> 00:51:11,621
No. Things have changed.

874
00:51:11,705 --> 00:51:13,081
Get the Director on the phone

875
00:51:13,165 --> 00:51:15,417
and have our jet at the tarmac at LAX
in half an hour.

876
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,585
Yes, sir.

877
00:51:27,929 --> 00:51:29,014
Officer!

878
00:51:29,598 --> 00:51:31,808
- Hugo, what's happening, man?
- Right.

879
00:51:32,058 --> 00:51:34,352
Well, yeah, hey, you're good to go in.

880
00:52:12,932 --> 00:52:15,559
Hey, man. Where the fuck Vitoli at?

881
00:52:18,687 --> 00:52:22,816
The fuck do you mean? I ain't trying
to clean this shit up myself, dawg.

882
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,361
Hey, don't even think I'm touching
my man's coat

883
00:52:25,444 --> 00:52:28,489
that I know you nutted all over,
you no-aiming ass.

884
00:52:28,864 --> 00:52:32,034
Man, what the fuck was you thinking,
barebacking them bitches, Hugo?

885
00:52:32,117 --> 00:52:36,121
I bet you your dick is disintegrating
as we speak, player!

886
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:40,543
Stupid-ass motherfucker.
Now, what the fuck is wrong with you, man?

887
00:52:40,626 --> 00:52:41,710
Hugo!

888
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:35,805
So, what did Mecklen have to say?

889
00:53:37,223 --> 00:53:38,933
They're getting close, man.

890
00:53:39,017 --> 00:53:43,313
Got about a handful of deal points
and then we're getting close.

891
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,065
What are you shaking for, man?

892
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:50,612
- But it's all good, right?
- Yeah.

893
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:58,870
- Look at me, man. Look at me.
- What's up? I'm working.

894
00:53:59,871 --> 00:54:02,040
- Yeah, okay.
- What's up?

895
00:54:02,874 --> 00:54:04,959
You believe in loyalty, don't you?

896
00:54:05,043 --> 00:54:06,586
Do I believe in loyalty?

897
00:54:06,669 --> 00:54:08,713
Especially the kind of loyalty

898
00:54:08,796 --> 00:54:12,175
where an otherwise sensible motherfucker
like myself

899
00:54:12,258 --> 00:54:14,969
- put his own best interests aside...
- That's why you're my man.

900
00:54:15,053 --> 00:54:17,180
'Cause outside a goddamn dog,

901
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:20,433
that kind of loyalty, my kind of shit,

902
00:54:21,643 --> 00:54:23,645
don't get no more dedicated

903
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:25,605
- or devout.
- What are you trying to say?

904
00:54:25,688 --> 00:54:28,566
What I've been saying. I need to get
your head of security right now.

905
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,610
He's not picking up the extension.

906
00:54:30,693 --> 00:54:32,487
I know that. What floor are they on?

907
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,989
- I don't know right now.
- What floor are they on, Ricky?

908
00:54:35,073 --> 00:54:38,201
Okay, you know,
that's one of our guys right over there.

909
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,495
Excuse me?

910
00:54:43,998 --> 00:54:45,291
Excuse me?

911
00:54:45,917 --> 00:54:47,168
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

912
00:54:47,252 --> 00:54:49,045
Special Agent Donald Carruthers, FBI.

913
00:54:49,128 --> 00:54:51,089
I need to get to
your penthouse level immediately.

914
00:54:51,172 --> 00:54:52,549
Well, I'm headed there right now. Sure.

915
00:54:52,632 --> 00:54:55,134
- Is this an emergency?
- Let's hope not.

916
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:13,652
I'm going down.

917
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:15,863
I'll bet you are.

918
00:55:22,578 --> 00:55:24,246
Faggot-ass redneck.

919
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:27,291
What'd you say?

920
00:55:27,374 --> 00:55:29,126
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator.

921
00:55:29,209 --> 00:55:32,212
Are these bitches
on a permanent smoke break or what?

922
00:55:32,754 --> 00:55:36,341
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
The ho train has left the station.

923
00:55:36,425 --> 00:55:37,759
Yeah, they're headed straight to you.

924
00:55:37,843 --> 00:55:39,553
- Good.
- Skank-ass bitches.

925
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,388
But that's the role you wanted to play.

926
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,640
Yeah, that says a whole lot about you.

927
00:55:43,724 --> 00:55:45,726
A ho, ho lot.

928
00:55:53,442 --> 00:55:55,068
What up, G?

929
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:58,947
Speak, come on. Speak up.

930
00:55:59,031 --> 00:56:01,575
Bitch, I'm about to ball this.

931
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:05,412
Okay, then. Punk.

932
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:06,747
No, it was not made clear to me.

933
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,873
This is the first I'm hearing of it.

934
00:56:07,956 --> 00:56:10,125
Have you contacted Agent Carruthers?

935
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:13,629
Yeah, cell reception up here is terrible,
but until you or I speak with him,

936
00:56:13,712 --> 00:56:15,547
he's the SAC and he's the guy I answer to...

937
00:56:15,631 --> 00:56:17,007
REPORTER: As to the identity
of the two bodies...

938
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:18,592
Look, in less than an hour,
you're gonna have

939
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,928
40 to 50-odd field agents
arriving in Lake Tahoe

940
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,387
without the slightest clue as to why.

941
00:56:22,471 --> 00:56:24,764
We are instructed to take Israel
into protective custody.

942
00:56:24,847 --> 00:56:25,932
That's a two-man operation.

943
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:28,100
What you're describing now
is a much larger movement.

944
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:30,645
- Messner?
- Listen. Hold it. I need to speak with Locke.

945
00:56:30,728 --> 00:56:31,812
Get him on the phone.

946
00:56:31,896 --> 00:56:33,689
If the situation's changed,
I need to hear it from him.

947
00:56:33,773 --> 00:56:35,274
- You Messner?
- Yeah. Who's this?

948
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:37,652
Take a look at that. Hollis Elmore.
Vegas resident.

949
00:56:37,735 --> 00:56:38,820
Used to be with the PD down there.

950
00:56:38,903 --> 00:56:40,696
Agent Messner, we recovered the car.

951
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:44,450
- What car?
- Dupree's car. '89 Cadillac Sedan DeVille.

952
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:47,620
- Where did you find it?
- Parking structure at the Nomad.

953
00:57:03,344 --> 00:57:04,846
Are the overheads necessary?

954
00:57:04,929 --> 00:57:07,181
Turn the overheads off! Now!

955
00:57:07,265 --> 00:57:09,767
- Not exactly low profile, is this?
- No, sir.

956
00:57:09,851 --> 00:57:11,102
Hotel locked down at all?

957
00:57:11,185 --> 00:57:13,354
I couldn't tell you that right now, sir.

958
00:57:13,437 --> 00:57:15,940
Hugo, what the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

959
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:21,445
What, you stuck on stupid or something?
I know. You rode a little bus to school.

960
00:57:21,988 --> 00:57:26,033
Hey, man, stop using that fucking lotion,
man. You look like a damn Muppet.

961
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:28,703
And don't let your bitch cut your hair
no more, dawg.

962
00:57:28,786 --> 00:57:31,747
It look like she put a bowl
on that shit, man. Damn.

963
00:57:31,831 --> 00:57:35,001
Hey, but you need to bring your ass
down here and help me out, Hugo, for real.

964
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:37,211
I ain't cleaning all this shit up myself, man.

965
00:57:37,295 --> 00:57:40,047
I'm tired.
I ain't no fucking cleaning lady, dawg.

966
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:43,509
For real. Bring your ass down here. Shit.

967
00:57:54,978 --> 00:57:56,062
What the fuck?

968
00:57:58,899 --> 00:58:01,401
Hell, no. You didn't do that, dawg.

969
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:08,450
What'd you say to Mecklen?

970
00:58:09,242 --> 00:58:12,913
What I've always been saying,
let's make the fucking deal.

971
00:58:13,663 --> 00:58:14,873
You see,

972
00:58:15,665 --> 00:58:19,336
this is one of them rare moments
where your ass get a chance

973
00:58:19,419 --> 00:58:20,587
to be completely honest.

974
00:58:23,006 --> 00:58:27,052
If I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen,
assume the shit is rhetorical.

975
00:58:27,969 --> 00:58:29,554
Assume I already know.

976
00:58:31,348 --> 00:58:33,141
What do you see right now?

977
00:58:34,142 --> 00:58:37,312
You see exactly and only

978
00:58:38,188 --> 00:58:43,109
what I choose to show you.
That is illusion, Ivy.

979
00:58:43,276 --> 00:58:48,073
That is the lie that I tell your eyes.
Making the magic happen

980
00:58:48,156 --> 00:58:52,536
in the moment, in that split second,

981
00:58:52,786 --> 00:58:56,623
but seeing behind this motherfucker
and knowing

982
00:58:59,543 --> 00:59:02,337
- that it's all bullshit.
- Yeah, you're on some bullshit.

983
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:06,591
But I can shape it, I can shift it,
I can make it as real as this room.

984
00:59:06,675 --> 00:59:10,720
That's why I'm valuable here, Ivy.
And that is why you are not.

985
00:59:10,804 --> 00:59:12,805
- I ain't valuable?
- I am sorry.

986
00:59:12,888 --> 00:59:16,267
I love you. I never wanted it
to be like this. You know that.

987
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:20,396
It don't matter what you wanted.
It's what you did.

988
00:59:21,438 --> 00:59:24,400
If you thought old man Primo
could twist your shit up,

989
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:28,904
wait till you see what I'm about to do here.

990
00:59:59,977 --> 01:00:01,520
I don't believe this.

991
01:00:04,815 --> 01:00:06,817
Battery's completely dead.

992
01:00:08,986 --> 01:00:12,990
Forget it. You won't get a signal in here.
You'll have to wait.

993
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:16,744
What about that line?
Can't you contact your people with that?

994
01:00:16,827 --> 01:00:19,455
No, these phones
are hardwired directly to maintenance,

995
01:00:19,538 --> 01:00:21,790
but once we reach the penthouse,
I can call down.

996
01:00:21,874 --> 01:00:24,376
I'll have the elevators taken offline, sir.

997
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,007
LOCKE: Pasquale Acosta.

998
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:33,344
Blood-money mercenary. El Estrago.

999
01:00:34,178 --> 01:00:35,512
The Plague.

1000
01:00:36,262 --> 01:00:38,848
When he was caught by the SAS in Belfast.

1001
01:00:38,932 --> 01:00:42,018
And in prison,
he chewed off his fingertips to the bone.

1002
01:00:47,774 --> 01:00:49,776
Why don't you have maintenance do it?

1003
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,279
- Do what, sir?
- Shut the elevator down.

1004
01:00:53,363 --> 01:00:56,699
An emergency shutdown
of our entire elevated lift system, sir?

1005
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:58,827
No. That has to be handled by my staff, sir.

1006
01:01:11,714 --> 01:01:13,883
How long have you been working here?

1007
01:01:15,009 --> 01:01:16,344
Bill?

1008
01:01:19,556 --> 01:01:23,226
MAN: Oh, my God, I need an ambulance
for Bill! I'm in the security room.

1009
01:01:39,409 --> 01:01:41,244
- Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
- No, no.

1010
01:01:41,327 --> 01:01:42,912
But that definitely sounds like gunshots,

1011
01:01:42,996 --> 01:01:44,330
and I don't know where it's coming from.

1012
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:46,249
It's your IFB, man.
Somebody got a earpiece.

1013
01:01:46,332 --> 01:01:47,667
You just picking up their signal.

1014
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:50,587
We need Nomad hotel security
to lock down the elevators immediately.

1015
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:53,715
Girl. Please don't tell me
this motherfucker just went off.

1016
01:01:53,798 --> 01:01:56,217
- Man, these fools.
- What? What's wrong? What?

1017
01:01:56,301 --> 01:02:00,095
Man, fucking security's shutting down
the elevators in your building.

1018
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:04,766
AUTOMATED VOICE: Please remain calm.

1019
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:05,934
Now that's the power, there.

1020
01:02:06,018 --> 01:02:10,564
Elevator service has been temporarily
suspended and will resume momentarily.

1021
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:12,858
Please remain calm.

1022
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:17,446
Elevator service has been temporarily
suspended and will resume momentarily.

1023
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:19,364
Well, let's get on it, then.

1024
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:33,003
- I wanna pick them down there.
- In the elevator.

1025
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:37,216
More duct. Come on, more duct.
A little more duct.

1026
01:02:44,473 --> 01:02:46,141
That's how we do!

1027
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:48,811
Now, okay, okay.

1028
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:54,358
Now, I'm a registered nurse
and this was my bath not a half hour ago.

1029
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:58,153
Whoopsie. We'll take care of that.

1030
01:02:58,237 --> 01:03:01,573
Hey, Boogie! I need you to go in,

1031
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:04,368
get my heating pad, get my blanket.

1032
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:08,038
- Nana, not during training.
- Okay, Grandma's big helper boy?

1033
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:10,582
Nana, Nana. Nana?

1034
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,001
Grandma will get it. Go on.

1035
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:15,003
Little angel butt.

1036
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:17,548
I feel like you're eyeballing me, dawg!

1037
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,926
I don't like punk bitches eyeballing me.

1038
01:03:21,009 --> 01:03:24,303
You got beef? You got beef?
You want some of this? Yeah.

1039
01:03:33,563 --> 01:03:35,064
What? What?

1040
01:03:35,815 --> 01:03:38,151
See? Skills. Skills.

1041
01:03:43,781 --> 01:03:45,366
Fucking stop it.

1042
01:03:52,498 --> 01:03:53,583
Yeah!

1043
01:03:55,877 --> 01:03:58,004
FEMALE REPORTER: The two men
were slain here earlier today,

1044
01:03:58,087 --> 01:04:00,965
as authorities speculate as to
the apparent disappearance of a third.

1045
01:04:01,048 --> 01:04:03,176
The name of one victim is being withheld,

1046
01:04:03,259 --> 01:04:06,304
but the other victim in being identified
as Jack Dupree...

1047
01:04:06,387 --> 01:04:11,225
Oh, shit. Goddamn it!
Son of a fucking bitch! Fuck!

1048
01:04:11,309 --> 01:04:14,020
MALE REPORTER:
The vehicle registered in Mr Dupree's name

1049
01:04:14,103 --> 01:04:17,648
has been recovered in the parking lot
of the Nomad Hotel and Casino.

1050
01:04:18,024 --> 01:04:21,027
Don, if you can hear this,
I'm in the hotel, north side.

1051
01:04:21,903 --> 01:04:23,863
I changed lives for you.

1052
01:04:25,323 --> 01:04:28,659
You ain't never had to wash
another man's blood off,

1053
01:04:29,619 --> 01:04:32,788
dig it out of your fingernails.
You had us for that.

1054
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:36,125
You ain't never made no real beef
on your own.

1055
01:04:36,709 --> 01:04:38,794
Shit, as light in the ass as you are,

1056
01:04:38,878 --> 01:04:40,671
bet you ain't never had to make
nothing more

1057
01:04:40,755 --> 01:04:43,007
- than a fucking fist your whole life.
- Ivy...

1058
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:46,844
So if you think I'm gonna let
your little punk ass with the dirt I done...

1059
01:04:46,928 --> 01:04:48,012
Listen to me.

1060
01:04:48,095 --> 01:04:50,472
...sell me off like a fucking field nigga...

1061
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:53,183
- You know I wouldn't.
...hand me to the feds like your last chip...

1062
01:04:53,266 --> 01:04:54,643
Whatever you think, whatever...

1063
01:04:54,726 --> 01:04:57,145
You must be out of your fucking mind.

1064
01:04:57,229 --> 01:04:58,313
If you...

1065
01:04:58,396 --> 01:04:59,564
Motherfuck! Motherfucker!

1066
01:05:02,692 --> 01:05:04,444
You're out of your fucking mind!

1067
01:05:04,528 --> 01:05:05,904
You fucked up...

1068
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,407
You're fucked up, Ivy!

1069
01:05:09,491 --> 01:05:10,617
- Hugo! You hit?
- No! No, no, no!

1070
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:14,162
- Mr Israel!
- I'm in here! Ivy's trying to kill me!

1071
01:05:14,246 --> 01:05:16,039
- Motherfuck you!
- Fuck you!

1072
01:05:16,122 --> 01:05:17,415
- Get in here!
- Come on.

1073
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:20,210
Shit.

1074
01:05:20,293 --> 01:05:22,963
Drop that goddamn gun now
or you're a dead man!

1075
01:05:24,923 --> 01:05:26,758
Jesus Christ. Beanie's dead.

1076
01:05:38,145 --> 01:05:39,771
You murdered Beanie.

1077
01:05:39,855 --> 01:05:43,400
Put the guns down. He's got nothing.
Get him out of here.

1078
01:05:43,483 --> 01:05:45,110
- Jimmy, cuff him.
- Put him in...

1079
01:05:45,193 --> 01:05:47,154
Take him to the service exit. It's quick.

1080
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,739
Get back here. We'll handle the rest of it.
You all right, Hugo?

1081
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,534
- He's fine.
- He's giving us up to the feds, Hugo!

1082
01:05:52,617 --> 01:05:54,202
Yo, get out of here, Hugo, man!

1083
01:05:54,286 --> 01:05:56,496
He working with them people, Hugo!

1084
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:59,291
It's all bullshit. You know that, Hugo.

1085
01:05:59,374 --> 01:06:01,877
You all right? You stay with me.
Stay with me.

1086
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,297
Mecklen's gonna call any second, all right?
All right? You with me?

1087
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:07,132
You with me, baby? Huh?

1088
01:06:09,676 --> 01:06:11,136
We're almost home.

1089
01:06:23,564 --> 01:06:24,773
These two are down.

1090
01:06:24,857 --> 01:06:26,734
What the fuck is going on?

1091
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:33,991
Come on, you fucker.

1092
01:06:37,328 --> 01:06:38,996
WATTERS: Forget it. It's done.

1093
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,581
Hey, quit saying that, all right?

1094
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:43,709
Girl, I just saw muzzle flashes
coming from that suite.

1095
01:06:44,502 --> 01:06:46,837
That's probably
where you heard the shots earlier.

1096
01:06:46,921 --> 01:06:49,590
Somebody just deaded Israel's ass.
It's a wrap.

1097
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:53,636
I ain't come all this way just to pack it up
because you thinking something up.

1098
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:56,764
Whatever, man. We can bounce out,
chill for a little bit.

1099
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:59,391
Shoot a little craps. Maybe spend the night.

1100
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:11,195
Come on, baby, look.
We could break down now...

1101
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:12,696
Shit, girl.

1102
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:13,864
What?

1103
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:19,036
These two dudes
just sitting in the elevator, all shot up.

1104
01:07:19,537 --> 01:07:23,082
Whatever it was, it got way past words.

1105
01:07:23,165 --> 01:07:24,750
What are they doing right now?

1106
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:27,545
Dying.

1107
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:31,882
So, them fellas, the ones that was shot
and tossed into the lake?

1108
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:34,134
Them police officers, too?

1109
01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:42,058
Them are left over after my hysterectomy,
so they'd be a few years old.

1110
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:44,102
I'm not gay because I have a beard.

1111
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,854
My fingers are cut off.

1112
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,730
Poor me.

1113
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,067
Warren, go and practise
your nunchakus now.

1114
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:53,069
Leave us be alone, shug.

1115
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,209
Go on, now, shug.

1116
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:10,253
Anytime, anytime, fag.

1117
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,255
I am sorry about that boy.

1118
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,799
His mama abandoned him
going on a year now

1119
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:16,551
and his daddy, my boy Dale,

1120
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:20,013
he's over at the Reno-Washoe
Correctional Facility.

1121
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,891
Got some clarity issues.

1122
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:25,935
Did some home-invasion,
sodomy-torture type stuff.

1123
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,896
Wrote a bunch of bad cheques.

1124
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:31,816
My husband, Bill, committed suicide
by hanging about nine months back.

1125
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,570
And ever since then, little Boogie there
has been man of the house.

1126
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,742
I don't think that's been opened
since my husband died.

1127
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:43,369
I might just borrow this for a little while.

1128
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,455
MESSNER: Your IFB working?

1129
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,581
No, that's why we're on walkies.

1130
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:47,957
Jurisdiction's a nightmare right now.

1131
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:49,501
- Anything more on Dupree's car?
- Nothing.

1132
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:52,295
You mean to tell me that nobody noticed
anyone getting out of a Cadillac

1133
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,463
that looked like a wiffle ball?

1134
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,589
- I know.
- Where's your guy?

1135
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:55,715
Right here.

1136
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:56,883
Ricky, this is Agent Messner.

1137
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,927
Tell him exactly what happened,
nice and slow.

1138
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:02,429
Yeah, so, earlier,
there was that guy, Carruthers...

1139
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:03,972
Yeah, Agent Carruthers.
Do you know where he is?

1140
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:05,474
- No. He wanted to know...
- Yeah, he's here right now.

1141
01:09:05,557 --> 01:09:06,642
We're talking to the kid.
We need about two minutes.

1142
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:07,810
...which floor security was on.

1143
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,229
And then later I saw him get on the elevator
with the other agent.

1144
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:11,730
Wait, hold on. Wait a minute.
What other agent?

1145
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,066
There were no other agents.
Our agents are landing here now.

1146
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:16,026
- There was nobody here.
- He said he was from San Francisco.

1147
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:17,861
Did he give you a name?

1148
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:20,197
Spanish something. It was Diego or Garcia.

1149
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,990
Yeah, run both those names
through the DC database.

1150
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:23,158
Something stinks here.

1151
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,409
Call San Francisco. See if they...

1152
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,328
You know,
he was wearing one of our jackets.

1153
01:09:26,411 --> 01:09:27,663
- What?
- Who was?

1154
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,332
The other agent.
He said he was here to do some inspections.

1155
01:09:30,415 --> 01:09:32,626
Then later, when I saw him get on
the elevator with Carruthers...

1156
01:09:32,709 --> 01:09:34,711
This man identified himself
as a federal agent?

1157
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:35,963
Yeah, I mean, he had the badge
and everything.

1158
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:38,924
And when you saw him later,
he was wearing one of your security jackets.

1159
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:40,175
Yeah.

1160
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,637
And that didn't seem odd to you?

1161
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:46,515
I mean, I thought they gave it to him
so he could...

1162
01:09:46,598 --> 01:09:47,808
Walk with me.

1163
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:52,020
Okay, so obviously,
we got a man posing as one of us.

1164
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:55,524
Make your team aware,
but do it quietly. Okay?

1165
01:09:58,277 --> 01:09:59,444
Fuck it.

1166
01:10:00,028 --> 01:10:02,364
Okay, now let's get
a tactical team assembled. We're going up.

1167
01:10:02,447 --> 01:10:04,074
Okay, we need to get
these elevators powered up.

1168
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,200
All right, maintenance,

1169
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:07,119
I need somebody
to power up these elevators immediately.

1170
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:10,247
I need to get Deputy Director Locke
on a hard line as soon as possible.

1171
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:11,373
All right, done.

1172
01:10:11,456 --> 01:10:12,499
Come on, step back, step back.

1173
01:10:12,624 --> 01:10:14,084
- Come on...
- Are you kidding?

1174
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:25,636
I thought you were gonna go...

1175
01:10:26,137 --> 01:10:29,432
Gonna go down and get Vitoli.
Get him back up here.

1176
01:10:29,724 --> 01:10:30,933
We gotta...

1177
01:10:31,601 --> 01:10:33,269
We gotta pack up.

1178
01:10:34,061 --> 01:10:35,771
We gotta pack it up now.

1179
01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:40,401
Bring him up here. We gotta get packed up.
We're gonna pack it up.

1180
01:10:40,485 --> 01:10:43,154
All right? Where is he?

1181
01:10:43,946 --> 01:10:46,908
- WATTERS: He's dead.
- No, I said dying, not dead.

1182
01:10:47,283 --> 01:10:48,367
Shit.

1183
01:10:52,121 --> 01:10:53,289
Shit, girl.

1184
01:10:53,748 --> 01:10:55,333
One of them is a fed.

1185
01:10:56,042 --> 01:10:57,877
Hello, did you hear me?
Did you hear what I said?

1186
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,420
I said one of them has got a FBI badge.

1187
01:10:59,504 --> 01:11:01,255
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold up, hold up.

1188
01:11:01,339 --> 01:11:03,049
I'm getting all kinds of shit
over this scanner.

1189
01:11:03,132 --> 01:11:05,843
- Just chill for a second.
- AGENT: Shots fired. West tower. Nomad...

1190
01:11:11,057 --> 01:11:12,725
All right, hold on.

1191
01:11:13,434 --> 01:11:16,896
Just lay still for a minute.
Let me figure out... What the fuck...

1192
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:18,731
Get out of the way.

1193
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,324
Fuck.

1194
01:11:30,076 --> 01:11:31,536
You ain't gonna believe this shit.

1195
01:11:33,996 --> 01:11:35,540
Both these motherfuckers is feds.

1196
01:11:35,623 --> 01:11:36,791
No. One of them is not.

1197
01:11:36,874 --> 01:11:39,210
One of them is bullshit.
It's all over the air here.

1198
01:11:39,293 --> 01:11:42,421
They got a impostor.
Some fool with a fake badge.

1199
01:11:42,505 --> 01:11:45,716
You think it might be that motherfucker
that Loretta was telling us about? Soot?

1200
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,970
Wait. Hold up, hold up.
What I got here is a Gerald Diego.

1201
01:11:51,471 --> 01:11:52,764
A Donald Carruthers.

1202
01:11:53,014 --> 01:11:56,977
Which one of them is for real?
'Cause I'm gonna kill the one that ain't.

1203
01:11:57,477 --> 01:12:00,063
Stop the elevator. Stop the elevator.

1204
01:12:14,452 --> 01:12:15,537
Come on.

1205
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:55,035
They revoked the deal.

1206
01:12:55,202 --> 01:12:57,496
They revoked the deal. They pulled it.

1207
01:12:57,829 --> 01:12:59,873
Wait, wait. What do you mean?
What do you mean, man?

1208
01:12:59,956 --> 01:13:02,083
We got it, we got 'em, we got 'em.
What do you mean?

1209
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:05,921
I don't know. It was the Deputy Director.
That prick, Locke.

1210
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:08,757
He just smashed everything.
He wouldn't tell me why.

1211
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,925
We're done.

1212
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:12,552
They're yanking us, Buddy.

1213
01:13:13,678 --> 01:13:17,097
They killed us. They killed us.

1214
01:14:12,236 --> 01:14:13,904
Three minutes.

1215
01:14:19,618 --> 01:14:21,203
Prepare to move.

1216
01:14:33,257 --> 01:14:34,675
North elevator door's open.

1217
01:14:34,758 --> 01:14:37,052
Possible aggression inside.
Check your fire.

1218
01:14:37,136 --> 01:14:38,595
Clear on my mark.

1219
01:14:39,888 --> 01:14:41,389
Shar. Shar seven,

1220
01:14:41,473 --> 01:14:42,765
I'm pinched.

1221
01:14:43,516 --> 01:14:44,976
Bring some heavy shit.

1222
01:14:45,059 --> 01:14:46,895
Fire from the sky. My count.

1223
01:14:47,228 --> 01:14:48,563
Bet.

1224
01:16:11,687 --> 01:16:13,522
Oh, my God.

1225
01:16:36,628 --> 01:16:37,963
SYKESS: Bring it.

1226
01:17:03,989 --> 01:17:05,699
Get the fuck down!

1227
01:17:08,619 --> 01:17:09,703
Get down!

1228
01:17:13,499 --> 01:17:16,168
Put your fucking hands in the air!

1229
01:17:16,251 --> 01:17:17,961
Throw your weapons down!

1230
01:17:18,545 --> 01:17:20,255
Step out of the elevator!

1231
01:17:20,339 --> 01:17:22,841
- Are these feds fake or real?
- I don't know!

1232
01:17:23,008 --> 01:17:24,593
Please, Sharice!

1233
01:17:27,054 --> 01:17:28,721
Oh, shit! I'm shot!

1234
01:17:31,015 --> 01:17:32,266
Georgia!

1235
01:17:37,396 --> 01:17:40,191
Georgia, where are you?
I can't fucking hear you.

1236
01:17:49,408 --> 01:17:50,910
How bad?

1237
01:17:51,494 --> 01:17:53,287
- Mortal.
- What?

1238
01:17:54,038 --> 01:17:55,748
- Mortal.
- No.

1239
01:17:55,998 --> 01:17:57,333
Fuck!

1240
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:59,252
Secure these suspects!

1241
01:18:03,172 --> 01:18:06,592
I need medical assistance.
I got multiple officers down.

1242
01:18:07,343 --> 01:18:08,928
- Watch him.
- You're okay. No, no. Stay awake.

1243
01:18:09,971 --> 01:18:13,141
Get me a medic! Get me a fucking medic!

1244
01:18:13,975 --> 01:18:16,269
- Where's that medic?
- Fuck.

1245
01:18:16,352 --> 01:18:18,479
If you can hear me, girl,
I can't see shit from where I am.

1246
01:18:18,563 --> 01:18:19,939
I'm moving down for a better sight line.

1247
01:18:20,022 --> 01:18:23,693
I got officers down.
Repeat, on the seventh floor, officers down.

1248
01:18:23,776 --> 01:18:24,861
Let me isolate the...

1249
01:18:24,944 --> 01:18:28,322
Never mind! Just get in there.
Get in there and pin that girl!

1250
01:18:28,698 --> 01:18:32,034
Sharice? Can you hear me? I'm hit.

1251
01:18:32,618 --> 01:18:33,995
Oh, shit.

1252
01:18:34,078 --> 01:18:36,497
I don't know how bad this is. Shit.

1253
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:38,332
That shit probably got through that Kevlar.

1254
01:18:43,796 --> 01:18:45,298
It's on the way up to the penthouse.

1255
01:19:16,828 --> 01:19:18,163
Lester!

1256
01:19:19,998 --> 01:19:21,082
Fuck.

1257
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:51,988
- Move! Move! Hurry!
- Clear the valet area.

1258
01:19:54,074 --> 01:19:55,450
Fuck. Come on!

1259
01:19:55,534 --> 01:19:56,910
AGENT: Left side of the building's
sealed off.

1260
01:19:57,994 --> 01:19:59,955
Goddamn. Can you hear me?

1261
01:20:01,373 --> 01:20:03,083
Get this shit off!

1262
01:20:03,792 --> 01:20:04,960
Move!

1263
01:20:11,466 --> 01:20:12,884
Girl, where are you?

1264
01:20:15,886 --> 01:20:18,139
God damn it, Georgia! Just say something!

1265
01:20:31,277 --> 01:20:32,403
Mother...

1266
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:37,449
Fuck!

1267
01:20:40,286 --> 01:20:41,370
I'm hit!

1268
01:20:46,917 --> 01:20:48,711
We need a medic!

1269
01:20:49,086 --> 01:20:50,171
Fuck!

1270
01:20:50,754 --> 01:20:51,964
Fuck!

1271
01:20:52,673 --> 01:20:53,716
Get me a medic!

1272
01:20:53,799 --> 01:20:56,051
I need a medic. I need a medic.

1273
01:21:00,764 --> 01:21:02,433
Somebody get him out of there!

1274
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:07,563
I fucked up.

1275
01:21:08,272 --> 01:21:11,233
I fucked up!

1276
01:22:00,698 --> 01:22:02,534
I got three coming down now.

1277
01:22:13,753 --> 01:22:15,421
Go! Move. Move.

1278
01:22:20,176 --> 01:22:21,845
Forgive me.

1279
01:22:24,305 --> 01:22:25,932
Get your hands up!

1280
01:22:29,936 --> 01:22:31,855
Check the vitals on this guy.

1281
01:22:32,188 --> 01:22:33,439
Initiate all clear.

1282
01:22:33,523 --> 01:22:34,607
- Clear.
- Clear.

1283
01:22:34,691 --> 01:22:36,359
Floor's secure, sir.

1284
01:22:36,442 --> 01:22:37,777
Okay, come in.

1285
01:22:39,028 --> 01:22:41,030
Hold him there till we get somebody up.

1286
01:22:43,408 --> 01:22:44,868
Where is Carruthers and Messner?

1287
01:22:44,951 --> 01:22:47,245
Carruthers is dead.
Messner's unaccounted for.

1288
01:22:47,328 --> 01:22:48,371
Account for him!

1289
01:22:52,375 --> 01:22:55,587
- What's your name, baby girl?
- Georgia.

1290
01:22:57,046 --> 01:22:58,339
Georgia.

1291
01:22:59,466 --> 01:23:01,843
You know you saved this black man.

1292
01:23:02,886 --> 01:23:04,470
Now all you got to be is grateful.

1293
01:23:07,181 --> 01:23:09,183
You hurting pretty bad, huh?

1294
01:23:10,225 --> 01:23:11,310
I got shot twice.

1295
01:23:13,479 --> 01:23:16,815
I think I accidentally shot and killed
my boy today.

1296
01:23:19,193 --> 01:23:24,072
If it gives you any comfort, you know,
I was going in there to act a fool, baby.

1297
01:23:25,616 --> 01:23:28,702
Straight-rocking heat, slaying niggas, man.

1298
01:23:29,203 --> 01:23:30,704
For real?

1299
01:23:32,414 --> 01:23:36,668
Your boy very well
might have been one of them.

1300
01:23:39,004 --> 01:23:41,882
I probably would've busted on you, too.

1301
01:23:42,049 --> 01:23:44,218
What a shame that would have been.

1302
01:23:48,514 --> 01:23:50,682
What was you doing here, anyway?

1303
01:23:52,309 --> 01:23:56,271
We was after some fool named Israel.

1304
01:23:58,148 --> 01:24:01,985
Damn, girl,
you're gonna make a nigga fall hard.

1305
01:24:02,569 --> 01:24:06,406
Put her down. Put her down
and get up against the wall right now.

1306
01:24:08,575 --> 01:24:11,620
Show me your hands.
Show me your fucking hands!

1307
01:24:11,954 --> 01:24:14,790
Drop the gun down or I'll fucking drain you.
Put the gun down!

1308
01:24:14,873 --> 01:24:18,168
I didn't do your man downstairs.
I found him like that.

1309
01:24:18,919 --> 01:24:20,045
Whether you believe me or not,

1310
01:24:20,129 --> 01:24:22,589
you know, that ain't even the least bit
important right now.

1311
01:24:22,673 --> 01:24:25,300
We're going to work this out and live,

1312
01:24:25,843 --> 01:24:28,554
or we gonna keep doing the same shit
we've been doing.

1313
01:24:28,636 --> 01:24:32,181
I ain't got no problem with you
or your Bureau,

1314
01:24:33,099 --> 01:24:37,395
so I think you're better off just moving on
and letting us be.

1315
01:25:21,147 --> 01:25:23,149
Agent Messner is on his way in.

1316
01:25:44,754 --> 01:25:46,464
- Agent Messner.
- What's going on?

1317
01:25:46,547 --> 01:25:49,175
Are you all right, son?
You need some medical attention?

1318
01:25:49,258 --> 01:25:51,177
No, I don't need medical attention.
Tell me what's going on.

1319
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:54,679
- Okay, come on, sit down.
- Please, no, I don't want to sit. Explain it.

1320
01:25:54,763 --> 01:25:56,973
It's very difficult to explain everything
right now.

1321
01:25:57,057 --> 01:25:58,517
Much larger matters loom.

1322
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,685
I'm sorry to hear about Carruthers.

1323
01:26:00,769 --> 01:26:03,355
- He's a good man.
- Director Locke?

1324
01:26:05,857 --> 01:26:09,110
He's had a sustained arrhythmic episode,
severe cardiac distress.

1325
01:26:09,194 --> 01:26:10,821
I can't help him here.
We have to take him to...

1326
01:26:10,904 --> 01:26:12,072
Okay, gentlemen,
let's get him up on the roof.

1327
01:26:12,155 --> 01:26:14,825
Get Mr Israel up on the roof.
He's travelling back with us.

1328
01:26:14,908 --> 01:26:16,660
I can't explain everything right now.

1329
01:26:16,743 --> 01:26:17,994
No, I...

1330
01:26:18,453 --> 01:26:21,039
- I need you to go back to Washington.
- What the hell happened here?

1331
01:26:21,123 --> 01:26:23,458
I'm sorry,
I cannot disclose anything more right now.

1332
01:26:23,542 --> 01:26:24,584
So many people are dead.

1333
01:26:24,668 --> 01:26:25,794
I need you to return to Washington.

1334
01:26:25,877 --> 01:26:28,255
- You'll be debriefed in the days to come.
- Explain it now.

1335
01:26:28,338 --> 01:26:30,340
Go back to Washington.

1336
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:31,716
There he goes!

1337
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,595
No, don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me, please!

1338
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:39,349
He went this way! Please, don't shoot me.
Don't shoot! Please! Don't shoot.

1339
01:26:53,113 --> 01:26:56,616
FBI. You gotta get up there! Got to go!

1340
01:27:09,171 --> 01:27:10,839
Get these hotel guests out
in the hallway there.

1341
01:27:10,922 --> 01:27:12,424
Just clear them down the hall.

1342
01:27:16,595 --> 01:27:18,846
Make room. Make room, please.

1343
01:27:26,979 --> 01:27:29,773
We'll have to go all the way around
to the other side.

1344
01:27:30,774 --> 01:27:33,277
Clear the way here. Clear the way.

1345
01:28:27,456 --> 01:28:28,582
Hey.

1346
01:28:32,336 --> 01:28:35,047
- That your car?
- No, I...

1347
01:28:37,758 --> 01:28:39,426
I'm confiscating it.

1348
01:28:40,511 --> 01:28:41,636
FBI.

1349
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:44,139
- Oh, you're FBI.
- Yeah.

1350
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:47,809
Yes, I am. I would advise you
to lower your weapon, sir.

1351
01:28:48,309 --> 01:28:51,146
You're investigating those murders
out at the lake, huh?

1352
01:28:51,312 --> 01:28:54,649
- Say what?
- Three men were ambushed and shot.

1353
01:28:54,732 --> 01:28:57,861
Two died
and had their bodies dumped in the lake.

1354
01:28:58,695 --> 01:29:01,531
The other has severe hypothermia,

1355
01:29:02,323 --> 01:29:06,453
possible dementia, and will probably be
a multiple amputee by week's end.

1356
01:29:06,536 --> 01:29:08,496
Shit, okay. You're right.

1357
01:29:10,248 --> 01:29:11,583
I'm sorry.

1358
01:29:13,835 --> 01:29:17,046
You shot me.
And you murdered my friends.

1359
01:29:17,547 --> 01:29:19,549
Yeah, I know.

1360
01:29:21,176 --> 01:29:23,970
- And you dumped us in the lake.
- Pretty much.

1361
01:29:24,179 --> 01:29:26,598
You were here hunting
the man named Israel, weren't you?

1362
01:29:26,848 --> 01:29:30,226
Is that who you was here for? Israel?

1363
01:29:31,853 --> 01:29:34,522
I guess we both got beat out then,
didn't we?

1364
01:29:35,106 --> 01:29:36,441
Yeah, goddamn.

1365
01:29:36,774 --> 01:29:40,779
Crazy motherfuckers up there, huh?
Gee whiz.

1366
01:29:43,114 --> 01:29:45,241
Just give us your keys
and get the fuck out of here.

1367
01:29:45,325 --> 01:29:46,409
Okay.

1368
01:29:57,045 --> 01:29:59,714
I'm really sorry about all that.

1369
01:30:01,216 --> 01:30:03,635
Shit gets wild and crazy.

1370
01:30:04,219 --> 01:30:08,096
Fate just up and fucks you
for no good reason.

1371
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,015
You know?

1372
01:30:10,891 --> 01:30:12,851
It's the way of the world!

1373
01:30:13,227 --> 01:30:15,187
The way it's always gonna be.

1374
01:30:17,523 --> 01:30:19,024
Okay, now.

1375
01:30:20,067 --> 01:30:21,401
Peace, bro.

1376
01:30:33,372 --> 01:30:34,873
Oh, fuck this.

1377
01:31:44,108 --> 01:31:47,445
Suicide of some sort.
You know, troubles with the law. Drugs.

1378
01:31:47,528 --> 01:31:48,654
Deal with the patients.

1379
01:31:48,738 --> 01:31:51,657
All right, Doctor, thank you.
You know, just make it sound good.

1380
01:31:51,741 --> 01:31:52,825
Okay.

1381
01:31:54,327 --> 01:31:55,995
Where's Israel?

1382
01:31:58,456 --> 01:32:00,500
- What are you doing here?
- My debriefing.

1383
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:03,669
Your debriefing? Your debriefing
will be handled in DC, like I told you.

1384
01:32:03,753 --> 01:32:05,630
No, we need to handle it now.

1385
01:32:13,554 --> 01:32:15,556
You are instructed to get out...

1386
01:32:17,225 --> 01:32:18,976
What are you doing, Agent Messner?

1387
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,895
Walk. Let's go.

1388
01:32:22,355 --> 01:32:24,941
You're going to tell me
why no call was made

1389
01:32:25,024 --> 01:32:27,693
to inform us that the Israel situation
had been altered.

1390
01:32:27,777 --> 01:32:29,904
Why I and my friend and partner,

1391
01:32:29,987 --> 01:32:32,115
whose body
is going into a furnace tomorrow,

1392
01:32:32,198 --> 01:32:33,324
were never fucking contacted.

1393
01:32:33,407 --> 01:32:36,202
- I cannot discuss it.
- You can and you will.

1394
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:39,872
You are finished.

1395
01:32:39,956 --> 01:32:42,458
Look at my fucking face.
You just figure that out?

1396
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:48,965
Get that gun out of my spine
or engage the safety, please.

1397
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:50,675
Thank you.

1398
01:33:02,686 --> 01:33:04,229
Make it make sense.

1399
01:33:06,231 --> 01:33:08,233
They are father and son.

1400
01:33:10,861 --> 01:33:12,279
Israel's mother was 19

1401
01:33:12,362 --> 01:33:14,906
at the time when she and Sparazza
had a brief affair

1402
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:17,117
of which Israel was the byproduct.

1403
01:33:17,367 --> 01:33:20,036
That same year,
she brought a paternity suit against him.

1404
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,997
Paternity suit? Just for fun?

1405
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,082
Our surveillance of Padiche, Serna...

1406
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:28,044
All bogus and bad information
that set off a series of unfortunate events.

1407
01:33:28,128 --> 01:33:29,671
- He's gonna clip Israel.
- Buddy Israel.

1408
01:33:29,754 --> 01:33:31,006
Buddy Israel.

1409
01:33:31,089 --> 01:33:32,174
Buddy Israel.

1410
01:33:32,257 --> 01:33:34,634
- They got a guy. Some Swede.
- Swede?

1411
01:33:34,718 --> 01:33:37,387
- Any word on this Swede?
...the mention of this mysterious Swede.

1412
01:33:37,471 --> 01:33:40,015
There's no Swedish hit man
on anyone's radar.

1413
01:33:40,098 --> 01:33:43,226
Dr Ingstrom, the Swede,
is not a hired killer.

1414
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:44,644
Supposedly a specialist.

1415
01:33:44,728 --> 01:33:47,481
He's had a sustained arrhythmic episode,
severe cardiac distress.

1416
01:33:47,564 --> 01:33:50,358
He's actually the head of cardiology
at Stockholm University.

1417
01:33:50,442 --> 01:33:51,902
Primo wants Israel's heart.

1418
01:33:51,985 --> 01:33:53,862
- Heart?
- Mention of Israel's heart?

1419
01:33:53,945 --> 01:33:56,406
He's one of the best heart surgeons
in the world.

1420
01:33:56,490 --> 01:33:58,909
The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot,

1421
01:34:00,410 --> 01:34:02,537
the man who escaped
the penthouse yesterday...

1422
01:34:02,746 --> 01:34:04,080
Don't shoot me!

1423
01:34:04,414 --> 01:34:05,499
...in disguise.

1424
01:34:05,582 --> 01:34:09,211
He was hired by Sparazza
to neutralise Israel's entourage.

1425
01:34:11,129 --> 01:34:14,132
Dr Ingstrom was here
to perform the surgery.

1426
01:34:14,216 --> 01:34:18,220
And as father and son,
they are blood compatible.

1427
01:34:26,936 --> 01:34:29,980
You're talking about a transplant,
aren't you?

1428
01:34:30,564 --> 01:34:32,399
You're talking about
a fucking heart transplant.

1429
01:34:32,483 --> 01:34:35,444
You're gonna kill Israel to save Sparazza.

1430
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:39,907
No.

1431
01:34:42,409 --> 01:34:44,954
Well, they dug it up in archives
as part of the Sparazza investigation.

1432
01:34:45,037 --> 01:34:47,790
That Sparazza
had major elective plastic surgery?

1433
01:34:47,873 --> 01:34:49,875
It wasn't elective.
It was undertaken to save his life.

1434
01:34:49,959 --> 01:34:51,085
Look at the work he's had done.

1435
01:34:51,168 --> 01:34:53,921
It wasn't cosmetic. It was reconstructive.

1436
01:34:54,213 --> 01:34:56,423
Look at the date of the first procedure.

1437
01:34:56,507 --> 01:34:58,509
Fifteen separate procedures since 1952.

1438
01:34:58,592 --> 01:35:02,179
Same year that Sparazza
supposedly murdered Freeman Heller.

1439
01:35:02,263 --> 01:35:06,183
I'd like to show you exactly what I meant
when I said, "Change my face."

1440
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,728
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

1441
01:35:09,812 --> 01:35:11,730
I will have my ears pinned back.

1442
01:35:11,814 --> 01:35:15,734
Removing a slight piece of bone in my chin
I will alter my jaw line.

1443
01:35:16,402 --> 01:35:20,114
A procedure known as rhinoplasty
will reduce the size of my nose.

1444
01:35:20,364 --> 01:35:22,491
If you add facial hair
to the equation, gentlemen,

1445
01:35:22,575 --> 01:35:25,119
you have a face
that looks nothing like mine,

1446
01:35:25,494 --> 01:35:28,289
and more importantly,
nothing like a federal agent's.

1447
01:35:28,372 --> 01:35:30,291
- Oh, Christ.
- I will maintain a slight limp.

1448
01:35:30,416 --> 01:35:32,835
My accent will be a regional Calabrese.

1449
01:35:33,085 --> 01:35:35,337
My birthplace, Cosenza, Italy.

1450
01:35:35,421 --> 01:35:36,547
That's him.

1451
01:35:36,672 --> 01:35:37,798
And my name...

1452
01:35:37,882 --> 01:35:40,342
- That's Heller.
...will be Primo Sparazza.

1453
01:35:41,719 --> 01:35:44,512
Now, gentlemen, I understand
that this is a dramatic approach.

1454
01:35:44,596 --> 01:35:47,599
He went deep cover in 1940.
He could have ripped the Mafia apart.

1455
01:35:47,682 --> 01:35:48,725
But I firmly believe...

1456
01:35:48,808 --> 01:35:51,102
Dismantled most of the organised crime
in this country.

1457
01:35:51,186 --> 01:35:54,647
...this is the only way
to truly infiltrate organised crime.

1458
01:35:54,731 --> 01:35:58,151
His superiors were convinced
that he had gone rogue,

1459
01:35:58,234 --> 01:35:59,527
swapped allegiances,

1460
01:35:59,611 --> 01:36:01,738
so they gave the order
to terminate his cover.

1461
01:36:01,821 --> 01:36:05,492
All this time, we were told
that it was Sparazza that killed Heller,

1462
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:08,703
when it was us, the FBI.

1463
01:36:11,873 --> 01:36:13,541
And we didn't kill him.

1464
01:36:15,293 --> 01:36:18,546
He survived. But the injuries he sustained

1465
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:22,050
required constant surgery,
forever altering his features.

1466
01:36:22,133 --> 01:36:26,888
So he assumed the identity of his alter ego.

1467
01:36:27,889 --> 01:36:30,934
The figment of Primo Sparazza
became flesh and blood,

1468
01:36:31,017 --> 01:36:33,895
and Freeman Heller was no more.

1469
01:36:36,648 --> 01:36:40,360
Now, the brass wanted Heller's op
removed from official records,

1470
01:36:40,443 --> 01:36:42,987
so they buried it completely
and they wrote Heller off.

1471
01:36:43,238 --> 01:36:45,865
All the agents from that era,
they're dead and gone,

1472
01:36:45,949 --> 01:36:48,159
so history defaulted to fable.

1473
01:36:48,243 --> 01:36:51,746
Until now. Heller's op predated
the second World War.

1474
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:53,706
About 60 years of amassed intel.

1475
01:36:53,790 --> 01:36:56,376
Do you have any idea
of how valuable that is?

1476
01:36:56,459 --> 01:36:57,544
Yeah.

1477
01:36:59,504 --> 01:37:00,880
So you made another deal, didn't you?

1478
01:37:00,964 --> 01:37:03,049
Israel's deal with the government
was tossed out.

1479
01:37:03,133 --> 01:37:07,053
We are now trying to rehabilitate him,
so we can attempt a transplant.

1480
01:37:07,137 --> 01:37:09,721
You realise that you're doing this
to save Sparazza?

1481
01:37:09,805 --> 01:37:12,558
No, son. I'm doing all this to save Heller.

1482
01:37:12,641 --> 01:37:14,852
So you send us in there, bugles blaring,

1483
01:37:14,935 --> 01:37:17,646
and when it bottoms out,
we're the last to know!

1484
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:19,898
We need cohesion
to move forward son, not...

1485
01:37:19,982 --> 01:37:24,445
Oh, shitcan the cue-card rhetoric
and talk to me like a man.

1486
01:37:24,528 --> 01:37:29,408
You withheld information while
Carruthers lay dying in vain and in the dark.

1487
01:37:29,491 --> 01:37:32,995
And your reasons for doing that
are exactly what?

1488
01:37:35,164 --> 01:37:36,331
That?

1489
01:37:38,125 --> 01:37:40,085
Some mob fossil?

1490
01:37:40,878 --> 01:37:43,213
A monster that the Bureau built?

1491
01:37:43,297 --> 01:37:46,341
You tell me something,
is he the Rosetta Stone

1492
01:37:46,425 --> 01:37:48,760
that's going to blow the lid off
the last 60 years?

1493
01:37:48,844 --> 01:37:49,887
Possibly.

1494
01:37:49,970 --> 01:37:52,222
Is he gonna show you
where all the bodies are buried?

1495
01:37:52,389 --> 01:37:57,186
Or is his ultimate worth bullshit?

1496
01:37:57,269 --> 01:37:59,271
Utterly useless?

1497
01:37:59,354 --> 01:38:02,441
- That's a risk we take.
- Yeah, empty pockets.

1498
01:38:02,524 --> 01:38:06,028
Empty pockets paid for
by the lives of our own people.

1499
01:38:06,111 --> 01:38:07,362
You're blowing this way out of proportion.

1500
01:38:07,446 --> 01:38:08,906
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1501
01:38:08,989 --> 01:38:11,033
- My guy is dead.
- You're starting to piss me off.

1502
01:38:11,116 --> 01:38:12,993
The Bureau betrayed us.

1503
01:38:13,076 --> 01:38:14,620
- Wake up.
- You betrayed us...

1504
01:38:14,703 --> 01:38:15,954
- Stop pointing...
...Deputy Director Locke.

1505
01:38:16,038 --> 01:38:17,122
Get that thing out of my face.

1506
01:38:17,206 --> 01:38:18,999
You betrayed us
the way you betrayed them.

1507
01:38:19,124 --> 01:38:20,209
You fucking asshole!

1508
01:38:23,796 --> 01:38:27,090
Okay, if you like, I'll take
your verbal resignation right here,

1509
01:38:27,174 --> 01:38:28,258
right now.

1510
01:38:28,342 --> 01:38:31,803
Do you want your career to end here, now,
like this?

1511
01:38:32,470 --> 01:38:33,638
Your call.

1512
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:36,766
Now, I'm prepared to dismiss your behaviour.
And in light of what's happened,

1513
01:38:36,849 --> 01:38:37,892
I understand it.

1514
01:38:37,975 --> 01:38:39,185
I really do, and I'm truly sorry.

1515
01:38:39,268 --> 01:38:40,812
But a decision has been made.

1516
01:38:40,895 --> 01:38:44,232
And we're required to abide by it,
regardless of our personal feelings.

1517
01:38:44,315 --> 01:38:47,151
Feelings that might run contrary
to the collective good.

1518
01:38:47,235 --> 01:38:49,570
And that, I need you to understand.

1519
01:38:49,654 --> 01:38:52,490
It's time for you to get on a jet back to DC

1520
01:38:52,573 --> 01:38:55,201
