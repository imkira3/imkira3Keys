1
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:04,631
<i>Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.</i>

2
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,186
<i>I hear the train a comin'
it's rolling round the bend</i>

3
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:21,398
<i>And I ain't seen the sunshine
since I don't know when</i>

4
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:26,987
<i>I'm stuck in Folsom prison
and time keeps draggin' on</i>

5
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:32,093
<i>But that train keeps a rollin'
on down to San Antone</i>

6
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,585
<i>When I was just a baby
my mama told me "son"</i>

7
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:45,631
<i>"Always be a good boy
don't ever play with guns"</i>

8
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:51,470
<i>But I shot a man in Reno
just to watch him die</i>

9
00:00:54,431 --> 00:01:00,229
<i>When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry</i>

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

11
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:38,183
I got another 15.

12
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,894
Not today, you don't. You're up.

13
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,440
You know the deal.

14
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:48,777
Successfully complete the mission,
you get ten years off your sentence.

15
00:01:51,738 --> 00:01:53,865
<i>You fail to follow my orders in any way</i>

16
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:57,786
<i>and I detonate the explosive device
in the base of your skull.</i>

17
00:01:57,953 --> 00:01:58,953
Good dog.

18
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:00,789
<i>We are a black ops unit.</i>

19
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:03,417
<i>Meaning, nothing you see here
ever happened.</i>

20
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:04,583
Savant.

21
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,904
<i>Your commanding officer
will be Colonel Rick Flag.</i>

22
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,922
Or would you rather be called Durlin?

23
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:10,882
I'd rather not be called at all.

24
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:14,553
But I'll do anything
to get out of this hellhole.

25
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,641
Well, welcome to "anything."

26
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:25,897
So this is the famous Suicide Squad.

27
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,525
Well, we consider
that term degrading.

28
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:30,861
The official term is "Task Force X."

29
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:32,321
And love 'em or hate 'em,

30
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:35,115
these are your brothers and sisters
for the next few days.

31
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,828
Oh!

32
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:41,872
Whoa.

33
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:57,596
<i>Captain Boomerang.</i>

34
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:00,223
<i>Blackguard.</i>

35
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,517
<i>Mongal.</i>

36
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:04,436
<i>Javelin.</i>

37
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:07,397
<i>T.D.K.</i>

38
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:09,816
<i>Weasel.</i>

39
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:13,403
<i>And, of course...</i>

40
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,156
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
Had to go number two.

41
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,741
Hmm, good to know.

42
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:19,659
Flag.

43
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,745
Oh, sorry. Comin' through.

44
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:22,870
Hey, Boomer.

45
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:24,471
What are you doing back
in prison, Harls?

46
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:26,500
I got road rage. In a bank.

47
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,794
Oh. So sorry. Comin' through.

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,213
- Turn it around. There. No.
- There? Here?

49
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,548
Put it in there.
Now you're safe.

50
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:34,715
All right.

51
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:36,218
Thanks, man.

52
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:39,471
Prepare for liftoff.
And away we go.

53
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:48,414
- Harley and T.D.K...
- Digger.

54
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:49,791
...have they worked
together before?

55
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:50,875
Not yet. I'm excited.

56
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:51,959
What does
Savant do again?

57
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:53,068
It's Brian Durlin.

58
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:55,654
He's an expert in weapons
and hand-to-hand combat.

59
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:58,102
Yeah, well, I'm putting 20 on
him that he's gonna bite it.

60
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,574
Me too. And Weasel,

61
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:01,052
- Boomer and Mongal.
- Yeah, I think...

62
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:03,370
Is Mongal an alien
or some type of god?

63
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:05,247
- What are you doing?
- Oh. Hey.

64
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,391
Just making sure
everything was ready to go.

65
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:07,517
Good meeting, everybody.

66
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,292
Just our normal,
casual morning meeting.

67
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,812
Yeah, I just gotta, uh,
do this thing.

68
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:12,036
Nothing weird about it.

69
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,410
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

70
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:17,509
Flag.

71
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,112
<i>Yeah, we're T-minus five
from the drop.</i>

72
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:20,363
Get the whole team safely

73
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:21,596
<i>to that beach, Colonel.</i>

74
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:24,224
<i>You will receive further orders
once there.</i>

75
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:41,658
We're in a butcher's freezer, Harls,

76
00:04:41,825 --> 00:04:45,078
surrounded by dead hogs
hangin' on hooks.

77
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:46,538
Only they don't know it yet.

78
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:48,957
Leave him alone, Boomer.

79
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:51,334
What does T.D.K. stand for?

80
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:52,502
What?

81
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:55,130
Your name is T.D.K., correct?

82
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:56,465
Yeah.

83
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:58,550
And it stands for what?

84
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:00,677
It stands for me.

85
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:02,012
It's what a name is.

86
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:03,805
Your name is letters?

87
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:06,308
All names are letters, dickhead.

88
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:12,272
I love your accent.

89
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,566
American women all love accents.

90
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:17,360
We do. 'Cause we don't got none.

91
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:21,615
- Yo, is this a dog?
- What?

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,909
Is this thing a dog?

93
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,203
- A... A dog?
- Yes.

94
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,622
What kind of dog
do you think it is, mate?

95
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,788
I don't know, I'm not familiar
with all the breeds.

96
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,584
I'm gonna go with Afghan Hound.

97
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:34,794
Since when does an Afghan Hound
have bloody thumbs?

98
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,838
Oh, my God, is it a werewolf?

99
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:38,524
I've wanted to meet a werewolf forever.

100
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,401
- Yo, they sat me next to a werewolf?
- That's not right.

101
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,928
Yo, let me out.
I do not fuck with werewolves.

102
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:45,347
Hey, hey, he's not a werewolf, okay!

103
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:46,848
He's a weasel. He's harmless.

104
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:49,267
I mean, he's not harmless,
he's killed 27 children,

105
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:52,562
but, you know, we got him to...
I think he's agreed to do this.

106
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:56,024
Whatever the case,
just everyone get into position to drop.

107
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,294
Did anyone check
on whether Weasel could swim?

108
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:40,086
The Weasel is dead! I repeat,

109
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:42,088
<i>the Weasel is dead.</i>

110
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:44,924
Northeast, all clear.
Approach the shore.

111
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,091
<i>Over.</i>

112
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:48,178
Savant, hold your position.

113
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,055
Roger that.

114
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:56,519
Amateurs.

115
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:11,451
Waller, we're
on the beach and dry.

116
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,184
- Blackguard. Get down, you...
- Hey, guys!

117
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,995
- There's fucking soldiers everywhere!
- Hey.

118
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,479
You can come out now, it's just me.

119
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:41,064
What the fuck is Blackguard doin'?

120
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:42,774
I'm the one who contacted you.

121
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,585
Is this what's supposed to happen?
What the fuck?

122
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,128
Blackguard, get back into your position.

123
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:48,154
Look, look. I brought everybody, look.

124
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,948
They're right behind me.

125
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:52,117
Whoa. Hey.

126
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,035
Hey, guys. Whoa.

127
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:56,746
We got a deal, right? Uh... Uh...

128
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:58,248
Waller, we're made.

129
00:08:58,415 --> 00:08:59,958
I'm the one who called you.

130
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:07,507
Blackguard sold us out.

131
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:11,261
<i>He contacted the fucking
Corto Maltese Army!</i>

132
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:13,471
<i>Waller, we need to retreat.</i>

133
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:15,222
Negative, Flag.

134
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:16,599
The mission is too important.

135
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:17,976
<i>This is a tough group.</i>

136
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,269
<i>- You can make it.</i>
- Okey-doke.

137
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:20,913
Waller, with all due respect,
we're in the middle

138
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:22,105
of a goddamn... Harley, wait!

139
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,523
Whoo-hoo!

140
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:05,774
Zero-two-two-seven is wide open.

141
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,276
Colonel, dispatch
The Detachable Kid.

142
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,278
T.D.K., two o'clock!

143
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:14,449
T.D.K. is "The Detachable Kid"?

144
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:35,887
What the fuck?

145
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:38,515
I didn't pick the damn team!

146
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:41,726
Don't worry, Flag, I got the bird.

147
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:44,771
Mongal! Don't.

148
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:49,234
Huh?

149
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:01,162
Strewth!

150
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,543
Boomer!

151
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,408
Savant is off the rails.

152
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:40,493
Savant, turn back.

153
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,790
<i>Savant.</i>

154
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,879
Savant, I'm warning you,
this is desertion.

155
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:54,299
Savant!

156
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:56,843
This is your last chance.
Turn back around.

157
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,596
<i>You are in violation of your agreement!</i>

158
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,975
<i>Oh, please! No.</i>

159
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:09,397
Damn it.

160
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:25,827
How's Team Two holding up?

161
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,252
Team Two, check.
Set point bravo.

162
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:35,214
All troops on the south beach
are engaged.

163
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:38,051
Team Two is clear to go
on the north beach.

164
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,929
Congratulations, Bloodsport.

165
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:56,361
How'd you do it, Waller?

166
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,656
There's no soldiers out here
on patrol at all.

167
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:02,659
<i>Let's just say they were distracted.</i>

168
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:10,083
<i>Teddy sniffing glue
he was twelve years old</i>

169
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,293
<i>Fell from the roof on East Two-nine</i>

170
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:14,879
<i>Cathy was eleven
when she pulled the plug</i>

171
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,423
<i>On twenty six reds and a bottle of wine</i>

172
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:19,634
<i>Bobby got leukemia, fourteen years old</i>

173
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:22,553
<i>He looked like sixty five when he died
He was a friend of mine</i>

174
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:25,181
<i>Those are people who died, died</i>

175
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,725
<i>Those are people who died, died</i>

176
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:30,144
<i>Those are people who died, died</i>

177
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:32,355
<i>Those are people who died, died</i>

178
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:35,483
<i>They were all my friends and just died</i>

179
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:40,071
<i>G-berg and Georgie
let their gimmicks go rotten</i>

180
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,448
<i>So they died of hepatitis
in upper Manhattan</i>

181
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,201
<i>Sly in Vietnam, bullet in the head</i>

182
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:48,162
<i>Bobby OD'd on Drano
on the night that he was wed</i>

183
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:50,123
<i>They were two more friends of mine</i>

184
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:52,583
<i>Two more friends that died</i>

185
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,336
<i>Those are people who died, died</i>

186
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,964
<i>Those are people who died, died</i>

187
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,299
<i>Those are people who died, died</i>

188
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,927
<i>Those are people who died, died</i>

189
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,847
<i>They were all my friends and they died</i>

190
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,435
<i>Mary took a dry dive from a hotel room</i>

191
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:12,645
<i>Bobby hung himself
from a cell in The Tombs</i>

192
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:14,522
<i>Judy jumped in front of a subway train</i>

193
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:17,942
<i>Eddie got slit in the jugular vein</i>

194
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,611
<i>And Eddie, I miss you
more than all the others</i>

195
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:22,989
<i>And I salute you brother</i>

196
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:24,449
<i>Those are people who died, died</i>

197
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:45,970
<i>I was not ready for the road</i>

198
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:53,519
<i>I was so discontent
to wear that heavy load</i>

199
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:58,816
<i>And so I got down on my knees</i>

200
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:04,489
<i>I made a sucker's prayer</i>

201
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:07,366
<i>A grim bode of baudelaire before</i>

202
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,329
<i>I wanna love somebody
but I don't know how</i>

203
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,126
Oh, jeez.

204
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:18,586
Oh.

205
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:20,922
Here you go, champ.

206
00:15:21,464 --> 00:15:24,342
<i>I've been so long lonely
and it's getting me down</i>

207
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:28,304
Excuse me.

208
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:32,850
Who the fuck is Bloodsport?

209
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,311
Robert DuBois.

210
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:37,605
A world-class marksman.

211
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:40,441
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

212
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,068
His father was a mercenary

213
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:45,154
who trained his son to kill
from the moment he was born.

214
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:47,782
He's in prison for putting
Superman in the ICU

215
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:49,617
with a kryptonite bullet.

216
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:53,246
- DuBois?
- Same answer as the last time.

217
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:54,664
Piss off.

218
00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:00,002
I'm not joining your
goddamn Suicide Squad.

219
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,212
We'll see.

220
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,006
You have a visitor.

221
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:20,398
They said you got in trouble.

222
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,608
I stole.

223
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:23,985
You stole what?

224
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,905
- A style watch.
- A star latch?

225
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:32,034
A style watch.
You can watch TV on it.

226
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,961
Why would you want to
watch TV on your watch?

227
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,454
I don't know.

228
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,057
Next time you want
to nick something,

229
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:38,165
you take a partner,

230
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:39,584
and they can be your lookout.

231
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:41,252
That's your advice?

232
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:42,711
Yeah.

233
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,338
- You're a terrible father.
- Hey,

234
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,066
I didn't ask to be a father
in the first place.

235
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,383
You make that perfectly clear.

236
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:48,968
Your mother sprung that one on me.

237
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,762
Well, she's not around anymore,
so you can lay off of her, okay?

238
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:53,097
Oh, I tried to lay off her,

239
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,900
but then she dragged out
the paternity test.

240
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,601
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

241
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,019
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

242
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,395
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

243
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:01,022
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

244
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,106
Fuck you!

245
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:06,110
I can't believe you don't care
that I stole, only that I got caught!

246
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,713
I don't only care that you got caught,

247
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:08,905
I care that you got caught

248
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:11,824
for stealing something as stupid
as a fucking TV watch!

249
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:14,118
It does other things too!

250
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:16,871
But nothing that your phone
can't fucking do! It's embarrassing!

251
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:21,292
No, what's fucking embarrassing
is having you as my father.

252
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:30,968
Yeah, well, I told you, Tyla,

253
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,888
when I came here that
any goodness I ever had in me

254
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,432
had been wrung out bare by my old man.

255
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,851
And I also told you to go out there
and do your own thing

256
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:43,272
and stay far away
from me or anyone like me, didn't I?

257
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:45,608
So, why are you here
when you and I both know

258
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:48,319
I have nothing good to offer you?

259
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:52,365
Because my court date is coming up,

260
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:56,535
and Miss Waller said
maybe you could help me out.

261
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,955
To get me to lead
your shite fucking mission,

262
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,141
you're gonna send
my 14-year-old daughter to prison?

263
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,165
No.

264
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,711
Your daughter is 16, DuBois.

265
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,606
- You're a real father of the year.
- Fine.

266
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,107
You know what,
Tyla needs to grow up anyway

267
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,651
'cause she's a little ditzy
like her fucking mother.

268
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:12,551
So, a year in juvie, no fucking problem.

269
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:16,180
Not juvie.
Being 16 in the state of Louisiana

270
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:18,808
means that under
the right circumstances,

271
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,559
she could be tried as an adult.

272
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,186
And, if convicted,

273
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,231
could be sent right here
to old Belle Reve.

274
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:28,109
And in here, well, you never know
what might happen

275
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,444
to a frail young thing like that.

276
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,154
Shames me to say

277
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:37,660
that we have the highest mortality rate
in the entire U.S. prison system.

278
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,282
Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

279
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,374
You're threatening my fucking daughter!

280
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,084
I'm protecting this country.

281
00:18:45,251 --> 00:18:47,086
- Everyone stand down.
- Miss Waller, I...

282
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,171
Stand down!

283
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,803
I wouldn't take such extreme measures...

284
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,680
Oh, extreme?
Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

285
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:59,724
...if this mission
weren't more important

286
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,183
than you could possibly imagine.

287
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,560
Fuck your mission.

288
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:04,407
You have the military
experience necessary,

289
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,856
and everything in your
psychological profile tells me

290
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:08,543
you have what it takes to be a leader.

291
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:10,234
No, I'm no fucking leader!

292
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:11,777
Then I'll make you one.

293
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,784
Are you in or out?

294
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:25,708
Good. Let's meet your team.

295
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,503
- Come on.
- Fuck me, man.

296
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,881
Let's go.

297
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:33,299
She was gonna kill his kid?

298
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:38,763
Each member
of the team is chosen

299
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:42,391
for his or her own completely
unique set of abilities.

300
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,479
This is Christopher Smith,
known as Peacemaker.

301
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,981
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

302
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:51,192
His father was a soldier
who trained his son

303
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,319
how to kill from the moment
he was born.

304
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:55,279
- Are you having a laugh?
- What?

305
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:57,174
You just said each member
of the team is chosen

306
00:19:57,198 --> 00:19:59,700
for their unique abilities.
He does exactly what I do.

307
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:00,867
But better.

308
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,096
- I always hit my targets dead center.
- I hit them more in the center.

309
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,723
Well, you can't hit something
more in a center.

310
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:06,290
- I use smaller bullets.
- What?

311
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:08,977
They go inside your bullet holes
without even touching the side.

312
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:11,629
Next up is King Shark.

313
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:12,796
Holy shit.

314
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:14,465
What the fuck?

315
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:16,256
Some people claim

316
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,303
that Nanaue is a descendant
of an ancient shark god.

317
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,430
Whatever the case,
he's strong and deadly.

318
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:22,640
Does it talk?

319
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:25,392
- Book read.
- Wow.

320
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:26,661
Book's upside-down.

321
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,285
See that? It's pretending
to read a book.

322
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:32,691
So smart, me.
Enjoy book so much.

323
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:33,859
Be a mite careful,

324
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:35,319
as he's developed a taste

325
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,904
- for human meat.
- Huh?

326
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,323
Next, we have Cleo Cazo,

327
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,867
Ratcatcher 2.

328
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:43,661
Settle down!

329
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:44,745
Ooh.

330
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,348
What, we couldn't afford Ratcatcher 1?

331
00:20:46,372 --> 00:20:48,624
- He's dead.
- This is his daughter.

332
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,584
Cazo, will you be joining us?

333
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:52,670
I just woke up.

334
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,964
I don't function well
early in the morning.

335
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,424
My deepest apologies for disturbing you.

336
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:58,759
Hmm, it's all right.

337
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,846
Get your ass out here!

338
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:09,228
Millennials.

339
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:13,983
Oh, no way.

340
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,361
- That's not coming with us.
- She controls rats.

341
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,947
I know, I caught that.
It's a disgusting superpower.

342
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:22,825
This is Sebastian.
Say hello, Sebastian.

343
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,787
I'm not shakin'
the rat's hand.

344
00:21:28,164 --> 00:21:31,333
And finally, we have Abner Krill.

345
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,169
What's that 'round his neck?

346
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:36,338
A power dampener.
They call him the Polka-Dot Man.

347
00:21:36,422 --> 00:21:38,549
Polka-Dot Man.

348
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,218
What's he do,
throw polka dots at people?

349
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,971
He does.

350
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:46,087
He throws polka dots at people.

351
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,683
Hey, Polka-Dot Man,

352
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,269
I was hoping you'd entertain
my kid's birthday party.

353
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:52,646
You fucking pussy!

354
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,150
These are soldiers?

355
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:57,818
We need to debrief.

356
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,745
Fuck.

357
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:10,039
Corto Maltese

358
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:13,792
is a small island nation
off the coast of South America.

359
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:18,130
Over the past 100 years, the country
has been ruled with an iron fist

360
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:19,715
by the Herrera family.

361
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:24,178
But, a week ago, this guy,

362
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:27,932
General Silvio Luna,
along with his right-hand man,

363
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,226
Mayor General Mateo Suarez,

364
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,229
took control
of the Corto Maltese government

365
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,773
in a violent military coup.

366
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,652
The entire Herrera family were
hanged in a public execution.

367
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:42,571
Although the United States

368
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:45,407
did not condone
the excesses of the Herrera regime,

369
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:48,160
they were non-antagonistic
toward the U.S.

370
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:52,081
Luna, however,
is virulently anti-American.

371
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:53,874
So, you want us to kill Luna?

372
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,417
No.

373
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:57,378
This is Jotunheim.

374
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:02,299
A scientific experimentation facility
containing something known only

375
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,885
as Project Starfish.

376
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:10,266
Our intelligence sources tell us that
Starfish is extraterrestrial in origin.

377
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,768
In the hands of the Luna regime,

378
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:17,314
it is potentially cataclysmic
for Americans and the world.

379
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:21,485
Your mission is to infiltrate Jotunheim

380
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:25,322
and destroy every trace
of Project Starfish.

381
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,740
How are we supposed to get in?

382
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:28,993
Gaius Grieves, the Thinker,

383
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,954
is a geneticist in charge
of Project Starfish.

384
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:34,832
After hours, he hangs out
at a gentlemen's club

385
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:37,960
known as La Gatita Amable.

386
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:40,921
Get Grieves to help you
by whatever means necessary

387
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,424
and he can get you into Jotunheim.

388
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,010
Any questions?

389
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:48,804
What is that?

390
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,807
That is an overhead projector.

391
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,309
Do you ever use it anymore?

392
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,810
No, not really.

393
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:56,770
So, why don't you just throw it away?

394
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:57,937
Peacemaker?

395
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,650
Starfish is a slang term
for a butthole.

396
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:03,569
Think there's any connection?

397
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:06,822
No.

398
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:08,699
No...

399
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:09,866
Nanaue.

400
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,035
...connection.

401
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,201
Hand.

402
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:15,874
Yes, that is your hand, Nanaue,
very good.

403
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,378
We're all gonna die.

404
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:22,297
I hope so.

405
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,674
Oh, for fuck's sake.

406
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:51,325
Control, we have a disturbance
south of here.

407
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:53,532
<i>It's just a diversion, Bloodsport.</i>

408
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:56,497
All right, we cut through the jungle
to get to Valle Del Mar.

409
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,457
Don't they have blockades
at the city limits?

410
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,666
That's the word.

411
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,419
How we getting in?
Especially with Charlie the Tuna here.

412
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:03,986
How the hell am I supposed to know?

413
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:05,214
You're the leader.

414
00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:06,621
You're supposed to be decisive.

415
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:09,468
And I've decided that you should eat
a big bag of dicks, how's that?

416
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:10,761
You're being facetious.

417
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,864
But if this whole beach
was completely covered in dicks,

418
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,366
and somebody said
I had to eat every dick

419
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,700
until the beach was clean for liberty,

420
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:16,934
I would say no problemo.

421
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:20,020
Why would someone put penises
all over the beach?

422
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,665
- Who knows why madmen do what they do?
- Well, you know what I think?

423
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,109
I think liberty is just your excuse
to do whatever you want.

424
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:29,113
Whether that's to eat
a beach full of dicks or killin' folk.

425
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:33,367
Oh, yeah?

426
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,620
At least I don't kill men
for money like you.

427
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:38,330
Oh, here we go.

428
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:41,166
There's something wrong with your skin.

429
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,626
It's just a rash.

430
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:43,961
That's a rash?

431
00:25:57,683 --> 00:25:58,684
Oh, no.

432
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:04,565
You...

433
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:07,443
are the only one...

434
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:12,823
fit to carry my javelin.

435
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:23,292
Carry it for...

436
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,191
Carry it for who?

437
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:48,817
For what? What the heck?

438
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,044
Who am I supposed to carry it for?

439
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,799
This is so frustratin'.

440
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,117
He just told me I have to carry
this javelin for a reason,

441
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,119
but he didn't say why!

442
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:04,958
Waller? Waller. Waller!

443
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,094
All right, we'll camp here,

444
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,221
and tomorrow we'll go
straight through to the city

445
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:20,557
to get to La Gatita Amable by nightfall.

446
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,297
What?

447
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,567
How deep of a sleeper are you?

448
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:56,653
I was having the most wonderful dream.

449
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,382
If it was you about to be eaten
by King Shark, then you're psychic.

450
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,286
I don't believe
he would do that.

451
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,493
He has very kind eyes.

452
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:09,082
Hungry.

453
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,126
You bastard!

454
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,962
Uh...

455
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,476
All right, calm down with the rats!

456
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:30,145
- What?
- I have a thing with rats.

457
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,230
- You have a thing with rats?
- Yes.

458
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,900
- And you're on a team with me?
- Not something I asked for!

459
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:38,796
What are you laughing at me for, man?
Why the fuck are you in your underwear?

460
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,197
Tighty-whities? Really?

461
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:41,883
- Now, that's just racist.
- No.

462
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:42,908
<i>It's not racist.</i>

463
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,285
<i>- They're tighty-whities.</i>
- Oh, come the fuck on.

464
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,788
Bloodsport's got a rat phobia.

465
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:50,123
What?

466
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:51,333
You didn't tell me

467
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,418
<i>you had a fear of rats, DuBois?</i>

468
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:56,254
I'm an assassin!
Why would I share my liabilities?

469
00:29:57,673 --> 00:29:58,753
For fuck's sake.

470
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,594
Aw. He's offering you a pretty leaf
to show you he means no harm.

471
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,081
Why the fuck would I want a leaf?

472
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:07,391
Just get the rats out of here!

473
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:16,233
- Oh, fuck's sake.
- Huh. Cool.

474
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:22,114
Hey, we gonna kill
Megalodouche now, or what?

475
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:23,841
<i>Nanaue's the strongest
member of your team.</i>

476
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,909
You need him to get into Jotunheim.

477
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:28,471
Yeah, well, we can't function as a team
if we gotta watch our back

478
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:30,872
from one of our own
eatin' our bollocks.

479
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:36,753
Nanaue, would you eat your friends?

480
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:40,048
I no friends.

481
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,509
You have no friends?

482
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:48,598
If you did, would you eat them?

483
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,058
Yes.

484
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:57,023
No?

485
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,985
Then, can we be your friends?

486
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,320
Come on.

487
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:03,864
He's obviously lying.

488
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:09,494
If I die 'cause I gambled on love...

489
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:13,123
it will be a worthy death.

490
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,709
Friends.

491
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:25,594
You are a little idiot.

492
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:38,064
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
I'm good at my job.

493
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,149
I found him.

494
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:40,609
Check it out.

495
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:43,111
Look, right here, a mile north.

496
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:45,280
Task Force X,

497
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:47,073
you have an additional
mission directive.

498
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,452
<i>We've located Colonel Rick Flag.
He's been taken by the enemy.</i>

499
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:51,661
Rick Flag?

500
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:52,954
<i>I know, you both served</i>

501
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,749
on special forces in Qurac
that took down Avral Kaddam.

502
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,502
<i>Flag was the one
who initially recommended you.</i>

503
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:02,047
You had other operatives
in Corto Maltese and didn't tell us?

504
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,689
<i>There was
no tactical advantage.</i>

505
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:06,259
<i>Now there is.</i>

506
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:09,179
<i>I've uploaded the location on your MTS.</i>

507
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:13,016
<i>Terminate his captors
with extreme prejudice.</i>

508
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:18,188
<i>Kill anyone you see.
These are dangerous people.</i>

509
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:21,942
<i>Recover Flag
before moving on to the city.</i>

510
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,739
That's where they're holding Flag.

511
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:30,075
Nothing like a bloodbath
to start the day.

512
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,369
They call you Peacemaker?

513
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:34,329
I cherish peace with all my heart.

514
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:37,791
I don't care how many men, women,
and children I need to kill to get it.

515
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,794
I thought
you were the crazy one.

516
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:42,629
I am.

517
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:44,256
All right.

518
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,674
Let's get it.

519
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:49,677
Boss.

520
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:51,388
<i>Gracias.</i>

521
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,695
No, no, no!

522
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:39,579
No, no, no!

523
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:05,188
Hmm?

524
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:10,568
Non-lethal.

525
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:11,820
You lose.

526
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,072
Exploding compression bullets.

527
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,411
No one likes a show-off.

528
00:35:19,577 --> 00:35:22,163
Unless what they're showing off
is dope as fuck.

529
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,876
Fuck. That's true.

530
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,185
He does throw polka dots at people.

531
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:47,188
I'm sorry it's so... flamboyant.

532
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:50,025
It looks cool. I think.

533
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:53,653
I don't like to kill people, but if I
pretend they're my mom, it's easy.

534
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,405
T.M.I., mate.

535
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:05,457
DuBois?

536
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:07,500
Hey, Flag.

537
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,170
What the hell are you doing here?

538
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,381
Waller told us that you were...

539
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:14,924
Uh...

540
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:16,885
Are you drinkin' tea?

541
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:19,804
This is Sol Soria, she's the leader
of the freedom fighters,

542
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:22,223
the resistance trying to
take down the current government.

543
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,933
They saved my life.

544
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:27,771
Oh, wow.

545
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,816
Why did my people not alert me
of your arrival?

546
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:36,297
- We didn't see any people.
- Yeah, I didn't see anybody on the way.

547
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:38,340
- There's no one out there.
- They were gone when we got here.

548
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:41,743
I turned them into my mother
in my head and killed them.

549
00:36:57,634 --> 00:37:02,388
Typical Americans.
Just run in, guns blazing.

550
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,682
I know, it's just messed up.

551
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,644
- These guys, they're...
- What's this one do?

552
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:13,399
They're fucking idiots, but right now
our objectives align with yours.

553
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,237
If Jotunheim contains the technology
our intelligence says it does,

554
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,157
then it could be used on the people
of Corto Maltese as well as Americans.

555
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:26,329
That's why we need your help
to get into the city so we can stop 'em.

556
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:29,707
Is that rat waving at me?

557
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:36,589
It appears it is.

558
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:39,259
Why?

559
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,678
I'm gonna guess because it's friendly.

560
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:47,142
Luna and Suarez
murdered my entire family.

561
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:51,271
I'd make a deal with the Devil
to stop them.

562
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:57,694
Your people will have our help
getting to Valle Del Mar

563
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:02,157
to apprehend this Gaius Grieves.

564
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,630
Hey.

565
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:21,342
- What is this?
- You slaughtered my staff!

566
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:24,012
They were loyal to the Herreras.

567
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:26,472
Who are you loyal to, Thinker?

568
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,558
They call you "Thinker," yes?

569
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:32,437
All that shit in your face
is to make your brain good?

570
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:35,106
Yes, makes my brain good.

571
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:37,650
Are you being sarcastic with me?

572
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,695
- Hey! Hey.
- I shall do to you

573
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,655
- as we did to your employees.
- Hey. Mateo!

574
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,289
What is this?

575
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:54,959
Project Starfish.

576
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:57,503
It's been the primary focus
of my experiments here

577
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,381
for the past 30 years.

578
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,016
Here.
What... What is it doing here?

579
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:12,018
Oh!

580
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:14,187
It is having little babies.

581
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,356
Not progeny,

582
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:18,233
extensions of itself.

583
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:21,152
They take hosts,

584
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:24,989
and those hosts in turn
become part of the central being.

585
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:29,410
It feeds on their consciousnesses.

586
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:34,707
Grows larger, more powerful.

587
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,881
So...

588
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,470
where is this Project Starfish now?

589
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,460
Marvelous idea, Presidente.

590
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:25,383
But as I've noted, I've been working
with the beast for 30 years.

591
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:30,013
And there's no one but me
capable of controlling it.

592
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:31,639
Well, then...

593
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,268
welcome to the team.

594
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:43,067
<i>SÃ­,</i> Camila.

595
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:44,838
Presidente.

596
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:51,492
You are making
a big mistake

597
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:52,577
throwing me down here!

598
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,037
I will be outta here soon enough

599
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,914
and I will kill every last one of you,

600
00:40:57,081 --> 00:41:01,002
Colto Maltese-tezios. Maltese-els.

601
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:03,671
Malte-multoids. Colt-a-mults?

602
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,424
Whatever you <i>Mario Kart</i>-racing
d-bags are called!

603
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:08,801
Please.

604
00:41:09,802 --> 00:41:10,802
Put this on.

605
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:24,984
Oh, wow.

606
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:30,782
I'm a princess.

607
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:54,847
<i>SeÃ±orita</i> Quinn,

608
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:56,474
on behalf of the entire staff

609
00:41:56,641 --> 00:42:00,186
of Our Honorable General
Presidente Silvio Eleuterio Luna,

610
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:01,513
it's a pleasure to serve you.

611
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:04,273
<i>Gracias.</i>

612
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:10,446
My mother said to count back again.

613
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:11,989
Ten, nine,

614
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:14,325
eight, seven, six,

615
00:42:14,826 --> 00:42:16,744
five, four, three,

616
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:21,290
two, one. Ha!
Coronel, beat that...

617
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:28,840
Oh.

618
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:31,467
Forgive my appearance,
<i>SeÃ±orita</i> Quinn.

619
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,097
I have admired you from afar

620
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:38,891
for many years now.

621
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:40,184
<i>SeÃ±orita.</i>

622
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:42,562
Me?

623
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:46,190
You're a hero to me,
as well as to my people.

624
00:42:46,357 --> 00:42:48,734
I think you might got me confused.

625
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:51,779
Harley Quinn's fire and rebellion
in the face of American oppression

626
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:53,990
is something to which
my entire country aspires.

627
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:55,450
Oh.

628
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:56,909
I have prepared lunch.

629
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:00,830
Would you be so kind as to join me?

630
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:05,084
I'm so kind, sure.

631
00:43:05,293 --> 00:43:08,546
<i>So if you're lonely</i>

632
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:12,258
<i>Why'd you say you're not lonely?</i>

633
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:17,221
<i>Oh, you're a silly girl
I know I heard it so</i>

634
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:21,476
<i>It's just like you to come and go</i>

635
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,978
<i>And know me
No, you don't even know me</i>

636
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:29,567
<i>You're so sweet to try</i>

637
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,278
<i>Oh my, you caught my eye</i>

638
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:36,449
<i>A girl like you's just irresistible</i>

639
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:52,298
<i>So if you're lonely</i>

640
00:43:52,381 --> 00:43:54,842
<i>Why'd you say you're not lonely?</i>

641
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,638
<i>Oh, you're a silly girl</i>

642
00:43:58,721 --> 00:44:01,098
<i>I know I heard it so</i>

643
00:44:01,182 --> 00:44:03,017
<i>It's just like you to come and go</i>

644
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:04,560
You want me to what?

645
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:08,105
To marry me.

646
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:10,024
You're joshing.

647
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:12,360
Might I be frank, Harley?

648
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,111
You might be.

649
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:17,823
Good, listen.

650
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,493
Since I took control,
the majority love me.

651
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,871
But some find me to be

652
00:44:24,747 --> 00:44:26,624
an unacceptable leader.

653
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:29,669
What kinds of dicks
would find that?

654
00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:31,837
Don't they know how awesome you are?

655
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:33,284
Have you shown them the birdies?

656
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:36,467
It may sound archaic to
someone from your part of the world,

657
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:39,053
but my people, the Corto Malteseans,

658
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,557
- they're very old-fashioned.
- Corto Malteseans, of course.

659
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:44,183
And I am a bachelor.

660
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:46,852
So they want you to get hitched?

661
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:49,230
My people say
you would make the perfect wife.

662
00:44:50,022 --> 00:44:53,359
Because, you know,
you symbolize anti-American fervor.

663
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:55,778
Oh.

664
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:58,864
But I am a romantic, Harley.

665
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:02,702
I agreed to meet with you
just to appease them.

666
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:07,331
However, upon spending
the day with you,

667
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:11,711
I find myself hardly able
to think straight.

668
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:16,299
- You are perfect in every...
- You are so freaking hot.

669
00:45:24,223 --> 00:45:26,267
<i>So if you're lonely</i>

670
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:30,187
<i>Why'd you say you're not lonely?</i>

671
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:32,732
<i>You're so sweet to try</i>

672
00:45:32,815 --> 00:45:35,234
<i>Oh my, you caught my eye</i>

673
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:39,864
<i>A girl like you's just irresistible</i>

674
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:42,825
Harley Luna.

675
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:46,454
I like the ring of that.

676
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,813
That's Jotunheim?

677
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:19,820
Nazis came here seeking asylum
after World War Il.

678
00:46:21,572 --> 00:46:26,494
They built Jotunheim to continue
their unorthodox experiments.

679
00:46:27,995 --> 00:46:31,499
Until the Herrera family accepted
the bounty on the Nazis' heads

680
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:33,417
and killed them all.

681
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:34,584
Wowza.

682
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,463
Many years ago,
the rumors began of a beast.

683
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:42,218
These dark rumors helped
the Herrera family maintain power.

684
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:45,846
They would send their political enemies
and their families to the fortress,

685
00:46:46,013 --> 00:46:47,348
never to return.

686
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:51,519
I have recently learned...

687
00:46:52,353 --> 00:46:54,271
these were not rumors.

688
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:56,607
They were murdering thousands

689
00:46:56,774 --> 00:47:00,403
in bizarre experiments
with this creature.

690
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:04,615
Well, it must be a big relief
to got it in your hands now, huh?

691
00:47:05,282 --> 00:47:06,701
Absolutely.

692
00:47:07,785 --> 00:47:11,455
Now, it is our enemies
who shall be fearful.

693
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:17,753
If anyone dares to say a negative word
about their new president today,

694
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,633
their parents, their children,
and anyone they ever loved

695
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,137
will be sent to Jotunheim
to feed the beast.

696
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:29,473
I'm sorry.

697
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:35,604
Recently, I made a promise to myself
that the next time I got a boyfriend,

698
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:38,566
I'd be on the lookout for red flags.
And if I saw any,

699
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:40,192
I would do the healthy thing

700
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,445
and I would murder him.

701
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:49,368
And killing kids?
Kind of a red flag.

702
00:47:50,995 --> 00:47:51,996
I know, I know.

703
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,957
I know what you're tryin' to say.
"Harley, why not just leave?"

704
00:47:55,124 --> 00:47:57,668
And I'd say, "Why are you
screaming at me? I'm not deaf.

705
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:59,086
I'm standing right here."

706
00:47:59,462 --> 00:48:00,880
And then I'd say,

707
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:05,050
"When your taste in men
is as bad as mine,

708
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:08,345
they don't just go away quietly.

709
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:13,100
They slash your tires
and they kill your dogs and

710
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:15,936
tell you that the music you like
ain't real music at all."

711
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:18,481
And all the cruelty...

712
00:48:24,862 --> 00:48:27,198
tears you apart after a while.

713
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:41,587
You were real pretty and all,

714
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:47,635
and R.I.P. to that absolutely beautiful
monster between your legs, but...

715
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:50,304
all in all...

716
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:53,849
I think you're more pretty like this...

717
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:58,437
with all those rotten thoughts
emptied from your head.

718
00:49:01,357 --> 00:49:03,192
I can't believe this thing had a bullet.

719
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:11,033
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

720
00:50:20,269 --> 00:50:22,396
BRING ME THE HEADS
OF THE SUICIDE SQUAD

721
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:29,320
What the hell
are you doin'?

722
00:50:30,905 --> 00:50:33,490
We're tired, Colonel. We need a rest.

723
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:35,326
Goddamn hobbyists.

724
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:36,869
We cannot stop.

725
00:50:37,036 --> 00:50:38,805
We need to hurry
if you're going to help my people.

726
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:40,998
Hey. We're not here to help your people.

727
00:50:41,248 --> 00:50:43,000
But she's right, we gotta keep moving.

728
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:45,377
I carry friend?

729
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:47,713
It's okay, Nanaue.

730
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:52,551
It's happening to his face again.

731
00:50:52,718 --> 00:50:54,219
- It's nothing, I slipped.
- Hey.

732
00:50:54,386 --> 00:50:57,389
Norman Bates, if that shit's contagious,
we need to know.

733
00:50:57,556 --> 00:50:59,433
It's not.

734
00:51:00,184 --> 00:51:01,664
- What is it?
- It's a...

735
00:51:04,438 --> 00:51:06,482
It's an interdimensional virus.

736
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:09,818
Fuck is that?

737
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:13,197
My mother was a scientist
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

738
00:51:13,364 --> 00:51:16,158
and she was obsessed with turning me
and my brothers and sisters

739
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:17,826
into superheroes.

740
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:20,913
She infected me.

741
00:51:21,747 --> 00:51:24,583
Now, if I don't, you know,
expel the dots twice a day...

742
00:51:25,376 --> 00:51:26,627
Then what?

743
00:51:28,921 --> 00:51:30,547
They'll eat me alive.

744
00:51:31,924 --> 00:51:34,385
What happened to
your brothers and sisters?

745
00:51:36,512 --> 00:51:37,680
Some lived.

746
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:39,473
Some...

747
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:42,850
died.

748
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:47,022
And your mom, where is she now?

749
00:51:51,527 --> 00:51:53,195
Everywhere.

750
00:52:00,536 --> 00:52:03,205
Okay. Let's move out.

751
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:06,875
Come on, we must hurry,
or we'll be late to meet my contact.

752
00:52:16,385 --> 00:52:17,654
<i>I heard the men saying something</i>

753
00:52:17,678 --> 00:52:20,431
<i>The captains tell they pay you well</i>

754
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:23,225
<i>And they say they need sailing men to</i>

755
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:29,815
<i>Show the way and leave today
Was it you that said, how long?</i>

756
00:52:32,151 --> 00:52:33,402
<i>How long?</i>

757
00:53:14,026 --> 00:53:15,736
Nom, nom!

758
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,241
Are you Milton?

759
00:53:22,868 --> 00:53:24,995
<i>Si.</i>

760
00:53:28,415 --> 00:53:30,417
Milton will drive you through town

761
00:53:30,584 --> 00:53:31,627
and to La Gatita Amable.

762
00:53:31,794 --> 00:53:35,255
There are clothes in the boxes
for all of you so you can blend in.

763
00:53:35,464 --> 00:53:38,050
That said, the walking <i>tiburÃ³n</i>

764
00:53:38,217 --> 00:53:39,802
is gonna have to stay out of sight.

765
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,428
I wear disguise.

766
00:53:42,179 --> 00:53:44,973
Oh, you're going to wear a disguise.

767
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,141
<i>SÃ­.</i>

768
00:53:46,225 --> 00:53:47,476
Hey, he's learnin' Spanish.

769
00:53:47,643 --> 00:53:49,770
And what kind of disguise?

770
00:53:49,937 --> 00:53:52,231
- Fake moustache.
- Oh.

771
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:55,234
Yeah, fake moustache
isn't gonna cut it, mate.

772
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:02,157
There's gonna be a lot of soldiers
watching Jotunheim.

773
00:54:02,991 --> 00:54:05,285
- If they discover us there...
- Let's pray they do not,

774
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:06,453
or you will all be dead.

775
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,205
If they do,

776
00:54:08,372 --> 00:54:10,457
that'll leave the palace vulnerable.

777
00:54:12,126 --> 00:54:15,546
Luna and the other generals
will be left without protection.

778
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:25,639
You're a good man, Colonel Flag.

779
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:31,562
You still look exactly like yourself.

780
00:54:31,728 --> 00:54:33,568
That's the worst fake moustache
I've ever seen.

781
00:54:33,981 --> 00:54:35,861
And if you had fooled us,
we'd have to kill you,

782
00:54:36,024 --> 00:54:38,986
shark-shaped bloke with a moustache
creeping up on us like that.

783
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:40,529
Fuck!

784
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:43,365
You, you.

785
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:48,787
Aw.

786
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:51,415
He always wants
to be near you.

787
00:54:51,582 --> 00:54:53,208
I think he senses good in you.

788
00:54:53,375 --> 00:54:55,210
Yeah, there's no good in me.

789
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:01,592
Damn.

790
00:55:01,758 --> 00:55:04,052
Supposed to play golf
with Senator Cray this weekend.

791
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:06,299
I'm gonna look a fool.

792
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:07,490
<i>Waller, come in.</i>

793
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:09,808
Ugh.

794
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:11,894
You missed.

795
00:55:11,977 --> 00:55:14,855
- <i>Waller, do you copy?</i>
- We're losing connection.

796
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:17,357
Waller.

797
00:55:19,735 --> 00:55:20,903
Fuck's sake.

798
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:22,696
- <i>Task Force X.</i>
- Waller.

799
00:55:22,863 --> 00:55:23,906
<i>You there?</i>

800
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,908
<i>The military must have put</i>

801
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:28,160
signal jammers around the city.

802
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:30,954
Your comms are down,
but we can still activate the bombs,

803
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:33,041
not to mention what will happen
to your daughter.

804
00:55:33,415 --> 00:55:35,250
So, no funny business.

805
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:36,793
<i>Do you copy, DuBois?</i>

806
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:38,377
Copy.

807
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:40,130
Fuck you!

808
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:43,592
Hey, uh, all that stuff
about his daughter,

809
00:55:43,759 --> 00:55:46,303
you wouldn't really do that, right?

810
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:49,264
You don't know half
of what I would do, John.

811
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:10,786
What?

812
00:56:11,745 --> 00:56:14,414
Why are you so afraid of rats?

813
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:19,544
Why are you so in love with them,
Ratcatcher 2?

814
00:56:20,754 --> 00:56:22,089
You know what I think?

815
00:56:22,256 --> 00:56:24,800
I think you have a serious case
of daddy issues.

816
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:28,428
I have no issues
with how much I loved my father.

817
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:39,398
Although he was a genius...

818
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,696
we lived homeless in the streets
of Portugal 'cause of his...

819
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:49,950
burdens.

820
00:56:52,536 --> 00:56:55,372
He built the machines I employ today...

821
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,459
...and taught me
the secrets of calling the rats.

822
00:57:03,547 --> 00:57:06,300
They brought us trinkets to live on.

823
00:57:07,259 --> 00:57:10,887
And they kept us warm at night,
when we would have frozen.

824
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:16,810
- But eventually...
<i>- Papa.</i>

825
00:57:16,977 --> 00:57:17,978
<i>Papa, wake up.</i>

826
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:19,980
...my father's burdens...

827
00:57:20,856 --> 00:57:23,066
became too heavy to carry.

828
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:24,609
<i>No.</i>

829
00:57:24,776 --> 00:57:25,776
<i>No, Papa.</i>

830
00:57:25,777 --> 00:57:29,115
- And he was gone.
<i>- Papa, wake up.</i>

831
00:57:33,994 --> 00:57:36,872
I took his machinery
and came to America.

832
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:38,665
That is the dream, right?

833
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,835
But I was arrested

834
00:57:42,711 --> 00:57:45,213
for armed bank robbery,
do you believe it?

835
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,799
The state considered the rats a weapon.

836
00:57:51,178 --> 00:57:52,387
What?

837
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,642
You remind me of my daughter...

838
00:57:58,518 --> 00:58:00,312
the reason I'm here.

839
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:04,232
Why are you so afraid of rats?

840
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,735
My old man.

841
00:58:08,153 --> 00:58:09,488
When I was a lad,

842
00:58:09,738 --> 00:58:11,615
if I didn't finish a task right,

843
00:58:11,782 --> 00:58:13,909
he would dole out the punishment.

844
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:19,998
And one day, he just locked me
in a crate for 24 hours.

845
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,378
And it was full of starvin' rats.

846
00:58:25,921 --> 00:58:28,632
As imperfect my father was...

847
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:34,471
he loved me.

848
00:58:37,933 --> 00:58:39,643
I wish I could give that to you.

849
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:45,023
Don't you worry, yeah?

850
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:47,734
I'm gonna get you out of here alive.

851
00:58:47,901 --> 00:58:50,737
I'm going to get you out of here alive.

852
00:58:58,036 --> 00:59:01,039
<i>SeÃ±ores,</i>
this is the place.

853
00:59:25,272 --> 00:59:27,482
So, when's this Thinker guy
supposed to be here?

854
00:59:27,649 --> 00:59:29,089
Supposed to be
in the next few hours.

855
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,503
Looks like we gotta find
something to do

856
00:59:30,527 --> 00:59:32,571
to pass the time.
Uh, miss?

857
00:59:32,654 --> 00:59:34,531
How about some, uh...

858
00:59:34,698 --> 00:59:36,658
What do you guys drink
around here, Fernet?

859
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:38,094
How about a round of Fernets
for the table.

860
00:59:38,118 --> 00:59:39,119
<i>- Comprende?
- SÃ­.</i>

861
00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:42,247
Hey, Pissmaker, we're on a mission.

862
00:59:42,414 --> 00:59:45,667
Easy, Inspector Gadget.
A little drink never hurt nobody.

863
00:59:45,834 --> 00:59:47,294
Except for the thousands of people

864
00:59:47,377 --> 00:59:49,713
killed in drunk driving
accidents every year.

865
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,092
Come on, DuBois,
this could be our last drink.

866
00:59:55,093 --> 00:59:56,261
<i>Gracias.</i>

867
00:59:56,428 --> 00:59:57,429
Just one.

868
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:00,265
- You're gonna be that guy?
- I'm gonna be that guy.

869
01:00:01,183 --> 01:00:02,559
Hey, <i>chica.</i>

870
01:00:03,602 --> 01:00:05,061
Forgot the rat.

871
01:00:09,733 --> 01:00:11,985
Here's to being alive in three hours.

872
01:00:12,736 --> 01:00:15,155
I'll be alive. You speak for yourself.

873
01:00:27,501 --> 01:00:30,003
There you go, there you go.

874
01:00:30,295 --> 01:00:32,547
Don't give any more to Polka!

875
01:00:33,423 --> 01:00:36,051
<i>I can't sleep,
I hope I stay awake</i>

876
01:00:36,134 --> 01:00:39,054
<i>Cause I've been running
running, running all day</i>

877
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:45,393
<i>Long nights, no peace
I feel like everybody's eyes on me</i>

878
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:48,522
<i>I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake</i>

879
01:00:49,272 --> 01:00:51,816
<i>Cause I've been running
running, running all day</i>

880
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:58,365
<i>Long nights, no peace
I feel like everybody's eyes on me</i>

881
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:00,700
<i>I can't sleep</i>

882
01:02:04,806 --> 01:02:05,926
Go. Go.

883
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:19,696
That is a gun.

884
01:02:19,863 --> 01:02:21,197
So, smile.

885
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:26,286
We're old mates who are gonna
take a trip to Jotunheim.

886
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,081
Yup.

887
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:34,794
Even with my help,
you think you can get into Jotunheim?

888
01:02:35,629 --> 01:02:38,006
Well, if we can't,
I've got a Great White out back

889
01:02:38,089 --> 01:02:39,249
that's looking for some chum.

890
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:40,425
Now, come on.

891
01:02:43,094 --> 01:02:44,137
All right...

892
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:46,931
nice and easy.

893
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,563
Oh, fuck.

894
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:14,834
No, no, no!

895
01:03:22,509 --> 01:03:23,885
All right...

896
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:25,529
Take him out
through the back, all right.

897
01:03:25,553 --> 01:03:28,306
Find my coordinates in the pad
and meet me in half an hour.

898
01:03:28,473 --> 01:03:30,475
- What?
- Hey, did you hear what I said?

899
01:03:30,642 --> 01:03:32,143
- Yes, but...
- Go.

900
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,854
Let's go.

901
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:39,567
Hey, calm down.

902
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:42,038
There's no need to disturb
everyone's night.

903
01:03:42,195 --> 01:03:44,035
I'm right here,
I'm the one you're looking for.

904
01:03:44,072 --> 01:03:47,200
Yep, us too.
We're his American companions.

905
01:03:47,367 --> 01:03:48,410
What?

906
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,704
Ow!

907
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,129
- Come on. Go.
- He...

908
01:04:01,923 --> 01:04:03,133
Oh, God.

909
01:04:04,259 --> 01:04:05,659
Move it!

910
01:04:07,345 --> 01:04:08,345
Come on!

911
01:04:08,805 --> 01:04:09,805
Hey!

912
01:04:22,652 --> 01:04:24,738
Your equipment manipulates
animal behavior, clever.

913
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:27,240
I'm working on something
similar with humans.

914
01:04:27,407 --> 01:04:29,117
Be quiet, please.

915
01:04:29,284 --> 01:04:30,452
You are perceivably panicked.

916
01:04:30,618 --> 01:04:32,996
I'm guessing that you are not the alphas
of this battalion.

917
01:04:33,163 --> 01:04:36,249
Do you want a dozen angry rodents
crawling up your ass?

918
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:38,727
My answer might not be what you expect.

919
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,172
Go, go!

920
01:04:43,298 --> 01:04:49,679
<i>I do not mind the rain sometimes</i>

921
01:04:54,267 --> 01:04:56,269
<i>'Cause that's the only way
the roses bloom</i>

922
01:04:56,436 --> 01:04:58,396
I'm sorry for you.

923
01:04:58,563 --> 01:05:03,193
But soon you will all be joining
your deranged compatriot, Harley Quinn.

924
01:05:04,569 --> 01:05:05,987
Is Harley alive?

925
01:05:06,154 --> 01:05:07,614
Not for long.

926
01:05:07,781 --> 01:05:12,327
Mayor General Suarez can be rather harsh
when extracting information.

927
01:05:14,204 --> 01:05:18,208
<i>The feeling, it comes at a cost, oh my</i>

928
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:24,047
<i>My poor heart is
My only friend, only friend</i>

929
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:29,719
<i>And I've come to love a heavy sky
Heavy sky</i>

930
01:05:29,803 --> 01:05:31,971
<i>Dim mak.</i>

931
01:05:33,056 --> 01:05:34,856
That's the Cantonese term for it.

932
01:05:34,974 --> 01:05:36,935
In Japan, it's <i>kyusho jitsu.</i>

933
01:05:37,685 --> 01:05:40,730
In English, it's simply the Death Touch,

934
01:05:41,606 --> 01:05:44,275
how to kill a man
with a single blow.

935
01:05:44,442 --> 01:05:48,363
Of course it's possible to kill a man
with a single blow.

936
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:54,077
But it's a matter of chance,
and cannot be wielded with certainty.

937
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:57,372
- That's what they say.
- They?

938
01:05:57,914 --> 01:05:59,165
- Amateurs.
- On one?

939
01:05:59,332 --> 01:06:00,416
One.

940
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:06,965
I don't smoke.

941
01:06:09,592 --> 01:06:14,138
<i>I do not mind the rain sometimes</i>

942
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:48,775
All right.

943
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,654
Let's go to Jotunheim.

944
01:07:54,197 --> 01:07:55,281
Nope.

945
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:58,076
There's somethin'
we gotta take care of first.

946
01:07:58,201 --> 01:07:59,202
What?

947
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:11,506
<i>I ain't got nobody</i>

948
01:08:11,673 --> 01:08:16,260
<i>Nobody cares for me
No...</i>

949
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:26,980
I will ask again.

950
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:32,026
How many meta-power teammates
arrived with you to Corto Maltese?

951
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:35,238
Sixty-nine.

952
01:08:35,321 --> 01:08:36,322
Sixty-nine?

953
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,909
How could you get 69 troops into the...

954
01:08:56,801 --> 01:09:02,640
<i>I'm so sad and lonely</i>

955
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:11,232
<i>Won't some sweet momma
Come and rescue me...</i>

956
01:09:33,463 --> 01:09:34,606
You gotta be kiddin' me.

957
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:35,983
You're gonna risk the entire mission

958
01:09:36,007 --> 01:09:37,735
for a mental defective
dressed as a court jester.

959
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,820
This coming from a guy
that wears a toilet seat on his head.

960
01:09:39,844 --> 01:09:41,947
- We don't leave one of our own behind.
- You're okay with this?

961
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:44,324
No, but I've been around Flag
when he's got a rag in his mouth.

962
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:46,017
- Best not to tug it.
- Motherfucker!

963
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:49,562
Hey, wake up, wake up.

964
01:09:49,729 --> 01:09:51,049
All right, let's go.

965
01:09:54,317 --> 01:09:56,086
All right,
we'll enter through the third floor,

966
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:58,362
go to the inner staircase,
and then down to the cellar

967
01:09:58,529 --> 01:09:59,965
where they usually keep their detainees.

968
01:09:59,989 --> 01:10:01,269
Hopefully, Harley's still alive.

969
01:10:01,949 --> 01:10:04,410
It's not a toilet seat,
it's a beacon of freedom!

970
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:27,326
<i>I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go</i>

971
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:35,585
<i>Paid for every dance
selling each romance</i>

972
01:11:36,085 --> 01:11:38,754
<i>Ooh, what they're saying</i>

973
01:11:41,591 --> 01:11:43,676
<i>There will come a day
and youth will pass away</i>

974
01:11:43,759 --> 01:11:46,429
<i>What, what will they say about me</i>

975
01:11:46,512 --> 01:11:50,474
<i>When the end comes I know
there's a just a gigolo's</i>

976
01:11:51,184 --> 01:11:53,394
<i>Life goes on without me</i>

977
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:57,940
<i>I'm just a gigolo everywhere I go</i>

978
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:04,780
<i>Paid for every dance
selling each romance</i>

979
01:12:05,364 --> 01:12:07,992
<i>Ooh, what they're saying</i>

980
01:12:08,075 --> 01:12:11,746
<i>And there will come a day
and youth will pass away</i>

981
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:15,082
<i>What will they say about me</i>

982
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:19,295
<i>When the end comes I know
there's a just a gigolo's</i>

983
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:20,671
<i>Life goes on without me</i>

984
01:12:23,466 --> 01:12:29,639
<i>'Cause I ain't got nobody</i>

985
01:12:29,722 --> 01:12:34,560
<i>Oh and there's nobody that cares for me</i>

986
01:12:34,644 --> 01:12:38,272
<i>There's nobody that cares for me</i>

987
01:12:38,356 --> 01:12:44,654
<i>I'm so sad and lonely</i>

988
01:12:44,737 --> 01:12:45,797
<i>Sad and lonely, sad and lonely</i>

989
01:12:47,073 --> 01:12:48,741
<i>Won't some sweet mama</i>

990
01:12:48,824 --> 01:12:50,910
<i>Come and take a chance with me</i>

991
01:12:51,452 --> 01:12:53,829
<i>'Cause I ain't so bad</i>

992
01:12:53,955 --> 01:13:00,419
<i>Sing on, pretty love song
all of the time</i>

993
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:05,258
<i>She will only be, only be</i>

994
01:13:11,806 --> 01:13:15,726
<i>I ain't got nobody</i>

995
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:18,104
<i>Oh and there's nobody that cares for me</i>

996
01:13:20,856 --> 01:13:24,777
<i>There's nobody that cares for me</i>

997
01:13:26,779 --> 01:13:28,990
<i>Nobody that cares for me</i>

998
01:13:29,073 --> 01:13:32,159
<i>Nobody that cares for me</i>

999
01:14:10,323 --> 01:14:11,324
<i>Hola.</i>

1000
01:14:21,584 --> 01:14:22,626
Um...

1001
01:14:42,563 --> 01:14:44,523
Ratatouille, what do you got?

1002
01:14:45,358 --> 01:14:47,318
Third floor hallway's clear.

1003
01:14:48,069 --> 01:14:49,153
Abner?

1004
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,947
There doesn't seem
to be any incoming traffic.

1005
01:14:53,074 --> 01:14:54,158
Bird.

1006
01:14:55,743 --> 01:14:57,620
Nanaue, stay off the comm.

1007
01:15:01,582 --> 01:15:03,185
Colonel, I got a clean shot
on the only one in the office.

1008
01:15:03,209 --> 01:15:04,710
Just give the word.

1009
01:15:13,177 --> 01:15:15,137
Fire on three,

1010
01:15:15,304 --> 01:15:17,515
- two...
- What are you guys doing?

1011
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:21,519
I... You.
We're here to save you.

1012
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:26,190
You were gonna... save me?

1013
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:28,901
It was a really good plan, too.

1014
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,737
Well, I can go back inside,
and you can still do it.

1015
01:15:31,904 --> 01:15:33,364
That's patronizing.

1016
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,616
Yeah, no, it's not...

1017
01:15:37,743 --> 01:15:39,537
Uh, what's with the javelin?

1018
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:41,122
I'm waitin' for God to tell me.

1019
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:43,090
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

1020
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:45,876
Or Him. Or any of them, really.

1021
01:15:46,043 --> 01:15:47,128
Okay.

1022
01:15:47,753 --> 01:15:49,004
Okay.

1023
01:15:50,214 --> 01:15:51,733
Are you two all right, yeah?

1024
01:15:51,757 --> 01:15:53,068
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

1025
01:15:53,092 --> 01:15:54,092
Harley Quinn.

1026
01:15:54,093 --> 01:15:55,511
Bloodsport.

1027
01:16:00,433 --> 01:16:03,227
All right, who ate
all the fucking empanadas?

1028
01:16:03,394 --> 01:16:05,896
Mine were very good. I had the chicken.

1029
01:16:06,772 --> 01:16:08,315
All right...

1030
01:16:08,482 --> 01:16:11,152
here's the deal.
We fail the mission, you die.

1031
01:16:11,318 --> 01:16:14,530
We find out any information
you give us is false, you die.

1032
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:17,867
If we find out you have
personalized license plates, you die.

1033
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:19,076
What? No.

1034
01:16:19,243 --> 01:16:22,121
- If you mismatch blacks, you die.
- No.

1035
01:16:22,288 --> 01:16:24,081
If you cough
without covering your mouth...

1036
01:16:24,165 --> 01:16:26,459
Harley. Those last three aren't things.

1037
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:28,265
Although, probably
don't need to say this,

1038
01:16:28,377 --> 01:16:30,045
but that isn't
an open invitation for you

1039
01:16:30,129 --> 01:16:31,273
to cough without covering your mouth.

1040
01:16:31,297 --> 01:16:33,150
All right, we're gonna need you
to drive the minibus,

1041
01:16:33,174 --> 01:16:35,759
with all of us inside,
past the guards at the front gate.

1042
01:16:35,926 --> 01:16:38,613
Once through the gate, we'll use you
to get through the retinal scanner.

1043
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:40,848
There are security cameras everywhere.

1044
01:16:41,015 --> 01:16:42,641
They're being dealt with.

1045
01:16:53,402 --> 01:16:55,571
We'll neutralize the soldiers there
and enter.

1046
01:16:55,738 --> 01:16:58,240
Once we're inside,
we separate into teams.

1047
01:16:58,407 --> 01:17:00,534
I am walking back and forth.

1048
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:01,701
Okay.

1049
01:17:01,744 --> 01:17:04,025
You're gonna lead me and Ratcatcher 2
to Project Starfish.

1050
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:05,974
I'm going with you
'cause I don't trust this guy.

1051
01:17:05,998 --> 01:17:07,350
No, no, no,
you're coming with me.

1052
01:17:07,374 --> 01:17:09,919
Our munitions expertise are needed
to place the explosives,

1053
01:17:10,085 --> 01:17:13,547
starting at the first floor,
going all the way to the top.

1054
01:17:13,714 --> 01:17:15,966
Once we're clear,
we blow the tits off that thing,

1055
01:17:16,133 --> 01:17:17,426
and go home.

1056
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,803
This is suicide.

1057
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:21,805
Well, that's kind of our thing.

1058
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:23,682
Yeah.

1059
01:17:30,231 --> 01:17:32,149
This is insane.

1060
01:18:09,812 --> 01:18:14,275
<i>Hey
Must be a devil between us</i>

1061
01:18:14,984 --> 01:18:16,860
Yeah, no.

1062
01:18:17,111 --> 01:18:21,824
<i>Whores at the door
Whore in my bed</i>

1063
01:18:22,241 --> 01:18:23,993
I love the rain.

1064
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,787
It's like angels are
splooging all over us.

1065
01:18:26,954 --> 01:18:28,372
It's good for cover.

1066
01:18:28,539 --> 01:18:30,082
Yep, that too.

1067
01:18:33,002 --> 01:18:36,171
<i>If you go, I will surely die</i>

1068
01:18:36,964 --> 01:18:39,383
<i>We're chained</i>

1069
01:18:40,342 --> 01:18:42,219
<i>We're chained</i>

1070
01:18:42,803 --> 01:18:47,433
<i>We're chained</i>

1071
01:18:47,516 --> 01:18:49,184
<i>We're chained</i>

1072
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,604
<i>We're chained</i>

1073
01:18:52,521 --> 01:18:54,315
<i>We're chained</i>

1074
01:18:54,857 --> 01:18:56,233
<i>We're chained</i>

1075
01:18:57,067 --> 01:18:59,069
<i>We're chained</i>

1076
01:18:59,612 --> 01:19:01,614
<i>We're chained</i>

1077
01:19:01,947 --> 01:19:03,574
<i>We're chained</i>

1078
01:19:04,033 --> 01:19:06,660
<i>We're chained</i>

1079
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,743
You son of a bit...

1080
01:20:07,429 --> 01:20:10,057
Input the emergency code. Now!

1081
01:20:10,349 --> 01:20:12,351
Well, go on then!

1082
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:37,830
Yo!

1083
01:20:38,919 --> 01:20:40,129
Okay, Pokey.

1084
01:20:40,504 --> 01:20:41,672
You get a bomb,

1085
01:20:41,839 --> 01:20:42,839
you get a bomb.

1086
01:20:42,923 --> 01:20:44,818
Harley and I will meet you
up on the second floor.

1087
01:20:44,842 --> 01:20:46,635
Yeah? All right.

1088
01:21:29,511 --> 01:21:31,305
God damn it, Nanaue.

1089
01:21:32,389 --> 01:21:33,974
No!

1090
01:21:34,141 --> 01:21:35,684
Quit bein' a play baby.

1091
01:21:36,143 --> 01:21:37,936
Peacemaker.

1092
01:21:38,979 --> 01:21:40,623
It's actually very nice.

1093
01:21:40,647 --> 01:21:42,357
Just put it against the wall.

1094
01:21:44,026 --> 01:21:45,402
It looks nothin' like me.

1095
01:21:45,569 --> 01:21:46,987
Move. Move it.

1096
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:51,575
This way.

1097
01:22:11,762 --> 01:22:13,096
<i>SÃ­.</i>

1098
01:22:19,353 --> 01:22:21,647
<i>VÃ¡monos. VÃ¡monos!</i>

1099
01:23:03,814 --> 01:23:05,107
Good God.

1100
01:23:05,274 --> 01:23:06,775
If God existed,

1101
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:09,987
wouldn't this be proof
that he wasn't good at all?

1102
01:23:10,779 --> 01:23:12,406
What the hell is this?

1103
01:23:12,573 --> 01:23:15,200
I thought you were looking
for Project Starfish.

1104
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:19,162
You've brought us visitors,
have you, Grieves?

1105
01:23:19,329 --> 01:23:21,748
Have you come to save me
from that madman?

1106
01:23:21,915 --> 01:23:23,917
Thirty years he's kept me here.

1107
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:25,711
Tortured me.

1108
01:23:25,878 --> 01:23:28,881
Had his way with me.

1109
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:10,297
I call it Starro the Conqueror.

1110
01:24:11,089 --> 01:24:12,799
That's meant to be derisive.

1111
01:24:13,592 --> 01:24:14,927
Sorry, old chum.

1112
01:24:15,093 --> 01:24:17,930
These two are here to kill you.
It's out of my hands.

1113
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:19,890
We need to help these people.

1114
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:23,518
Impossible, dear.
They're corpses below those stars.

1115
01:24:24,186 --> 01:24:25,437
Who are they?

1116
01:24:27,105 --> 01:24:29,566
The fodder of powerful men
through every age.

1117
01:24:29,733 --> 01:24:31,526
Dissidents,

1118
01:24:31,693 --> 01:24:33,070
journalists,

1119
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:35,489
political rivals,

1120
01:24:35,656 --> 01:24:38,158
and their loved ones.

1121
01:24:40,118 --> 01:24:41,745
Oh, please,

1122
01:24:41,912 --> 01:24:45,165
unclutch your fucking pearls, Flag.

1123
01:24:45,332 --> 01:24:47,626
We serve the same master.

1124
01:24:47,793 --> 01:24:50,337
We were sent here to stop you.

1125
01:24:50,504 --> 01:24:51,505
Child,

1126
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:53,674
your government didn't send you here

1127
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,635
to protect the world
from alien technology.

1128
01:24:56,802 --> 01:25:00,472
Your government sent you here
to cover up their part in it.

1129
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:03,016
You're a goddamn liar.

1130
01:25:03,308 --> 01:25:06,645
American goddamn astronauts
found Starro.

1131
01:25:07,187 --> 01:25:09,940
<i>Yankee-fucking-doodle dandies.</i>

1132
01:25:10,023 --> 01:25:11,525
Although the Cold War was ended,

1133
01:25:11,692 --> 01:25:16,113
your government saw the potential
in weaponizing such a powerful beast,

1134
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:21,284
but banish the thought of any such
experiments being held on American soil.

1135
01:25:21,827 --> 01:25:26,832
Your people have always been squeamish
about the sacrifices necessary

1136
01:25:27,457 --> 01:25:29,292
for scientific advancement.

1137
01:25:29,459 --> 01:25:30,627
So,

1138
01:25:31,586 --> 01:25:34,965
the United States made a secret deal
with the Corto Maltese government

1139
01:25:35,132 --> 01:25:37,592
to conduct
their illegal experiments here

1140
01:25:37,759 --> 01:25:38,844
<i>in Jotunheim.</i>

1141
01:25:39,011 --> 01:25:41,179
<i>And they hired me to oversee them.</i>

1142
01:25:41,346 --> 01:25:45,183
And now, because of
a run-of-the-mill fucking military coup,

1143
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:47,644
they're gonna destroy
30 years' worth of efforts.

1144
01:25:47,811 --> 01:25:49,104
Yeah!

1145
01:25:49,271 --> 01:25:50,981
You're the real victim here.

1146
01:25:51,064 --> 01:25:54,002
The hell you doing here? You're supposed
to be upstairs plantin' explosives.

1147
01:25:54,026 --> 01:25:55,819
I told you I didn't trust him.

1148
01:25:56,486 --> 01:25:58,447
Your records are located
in those computers?

1149
01:26:01,491 --> 01:26:03,577
Colonel, what are you doing?

1150
01:26:04,411 --> 01:26:08,331
I joined the military to serve
my country, not to be its puppet.

1151
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:11,334
What are you doing?

1152
01:26:14,588 --> 01:26:15,964
Who are you going
to show that to?

1153
01:26:16,131 --> 01:26:19,217
The press.
Goddamn people deserve to know.

1154
01:26:19,384 --> 01:26:21,029
I'm tired of coverin' up
their dirty little secrets.

1155
01:26:21,053 --> 01:26:22,554
This time
these sons of bitches

1156
01:26:22,637 --> 01:26:24,282
are gonna be held account...

1157
01:26:24,306 --> 01:26:25,626
I can't let you do that, Colonel.

1158
01:26:25,682 --> 01:26:27,350
- Excuse me?
- I'm truly sorry.

1159
01:26:27,517 --> 01:26:30,371
Miss Waller charged me with makin' sure
those records don't leave this building.

1160
01:26:30,395 --> 01:26:32,147
Of course, I shoulda known.

1161
01:26:32,314 --> 01:26:34,649
Waller's always got a backup.

1162
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:36,568
Come on, man, this isn't personal.

1163
01:26:36,818 --> 01:26:39,196
Holdin' a gun on me
is pretty fucking personal.

1164
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:41,615
What is that?

1165
01:26:42,365 --> 01:26:43,825
I'm gonna need that drive, Colonel.

1166
01:26:45,577 --> 01:26:47,579
Those morons set off
the explosives too early.

1167
01:26:47,746 --> 01:26:48,789
Hand over the drive!

1168
01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:51,374
Let's go, come on!

1169
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:53,001
They experimented on children.

1170
01:26:53,293 --> 01:26:54,961
No one is sayin'
what they did was right.

1171
01:26:55,295 --> 01:26:57,255
They experimented on children!

1172
01:26:57,422 --> 01:27:00,217
That information gets out,
it causes an international incident!

1173
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:02,677
Keepin' the peace is worth any price,

1174
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:04,888
including the life
of a hero like yours, sir,

1175
01:27:05,055 --> 01:27:06,223
so please...

1176
01:27:07,891 --> 01:27:09,226
don't make me do this.

1177
01:27:48,306 --> 01:27:49,850
What have you people done?

1178
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:07,659
Sebastian, come!

1179
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:45,655
Okay, we gotta calm down.
Let's all just... Let's talk about this.

1180
01:28:45,822 --> 01:28:47,342
I understand where you're coming from.

1181
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:48,575
I crossed a line.

1182
01:28:48,742 --> 01:28:50,285
Okay, I crossed a line!

1183
01:28:50,452 --> 01:28:52,537
I realize that,
but I'm ready to change.

1184
01:28:52,704 --> 01:28:54,539
I am ready to change.

1185
01:28:54,706 --> 01:28:56,583
And I didn't mean to hurt you...

1186
01:30:46,776 --> 01:30:48,653
You motherfucker.

1187
01:31:28,318 --> 01:31:29,778
Peacemaker.

1188
01:31:31,112 --> 01:31:33,156
What a joke.

1189
01:32:06,106 --> 01:32:07,107
Cleo.

1190
01:32:08,733 --> 01:32:10,485
Give me back the drive.

1191
01:32:31,923 --> 01:32:34,426
I told you that information
can't get out. Fuck!

1192
01:32:34,592 --> 01:32:38,304
So, okay, okay, destroy the hard drive.
Why kill me?

1193
01:32:45,854 --> 01:32:47,605
Because I'm thorough.

1194
01:32:49,816 --> 01:32:51,025
Oh, my...

1195
01:32:51,484 --> 01:32:52,861
Sorry, kid.

1196
01:32:53,027 --> 01:32:54,487
No, no...

1197
01:33:04,289 --> 01:33:05,540
All right, troops are coming.

1198
01:33:05,707 --> 01:33:07,750
This floor, and then nine floors left.
Let's go!

1199
01:33:07,917 --> 01:33:09,294
Come on!

1200
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:32,293
New dumb friends.

1201
01:34:45,431 --> 01:34:47,475
Aw, fizzle sticks. Hold on.

1202
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,504
Has anyone got eyes or ears on any more?

1203
01:35:16,671 --> 01:35:18,006
They killed Milton!

1204
01:35:20,133 --> 01:35:21,884
Milton was still with us?

1205
01:35:22,051 --> 01:35:23,862
- Where'd you think he was?
- I don't know.

1206
01:35:23,886 --> 01:35:25,364
I thought he stayed back with the bus.

1207
01:35:25,388 --> 01:35:26,431
What was Milton gonna do?

1208
01:35:26,598 --> 01:35:27,849
He was helping us!

1209
01:35:29,726 --> 01:35:31,019
- Who's Milton?
- What?

1210
01:35:31,102 --> 01:35:32,854
I don't remember any Milton.

1211
01:35:33,021 --> 01:35:36,316
Fuck! He has been with us
the whole time.

1212
01:35:36,482 --> 01:35:37,859
Somebody named Milton

1213
01:35:38,026 --> 01:35:40,695
- has been with us the whole time?
- Yes!

1214
01:35:40,862 --> 01:35:42,506
I don't think so.
I think I would've noticed

1215
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:44,949
if a guy named Milton's been with us.

1216
01:35:45,116 --> 01:35:46,534
It's not a very common name.

1217
01:35:46,701 --> 01:35:49,245
I don't think
I've ever even met a Milton.

1218
01:35:49,662 --> 01:35:51,247
Are you messing around right now?

1219
01:35:51,581 --> 01:35:52,874
He was a really nice guy,

1220
01:35:53,041 --> 01:35:55,418
and he sacrificed himself to help us.

1221
01:35:55,877 --> 01:35:57,253
And now look at him.

1222
01:35:57,587 --> 01:35:59,172
He's dead.

1223
01:36:01,007 --> 01:36:05,553
Oh, that guy!
Milton, Milton.

1224
01:36:09,098 --> 01:36:11,601
So, when did this great love affair
with Milton start?

1225
01:36:11,768 --> 01:36:14,896
I liked him from the beginning, okay?
I just didn't say anything until...

1226
01:36:17,398 --> 01:36:19,067
No!

1227
01:38:13,681 --> 01:38:16,058
Harley! Give us a hand!

1228
01:38:25,026 --> 01:38:26,027
Hey!

1229
01:38:37,622 --> 01:38:38,915
<i>Vamos. Vamos.</i>

1230
01:39:22,834 --> 01:39:23,835
Oh!

1231
01:40:13,342 --> 01:40:15,678
Oh, fuck, fuck.

1232
01:40:18,306 --> 01:40:20,641
Oh, fuck off!

1233
01:40:21,392 --> 01:40:22,435
Oh.

1234
01:40:42,121 --> 01:40:43,456
Sorry, kid.

1235
01:40:43,623 --> 01:40:45,166
No, no, no.

1236
01:41:40,221 --> 01:41:41,806
How?

1237
01:41:41,973 --> 01:41:43,683
Smaller bullets.

1238
01:41:48,562 --> 01:41:50,940
He killed Colonel Flag.

1239
01:41:52,233 --> 01:41:54,151
He wanted to share this with the press.

1240
01:41:54,318 --> 01:41:56,070
It's proof the American government

1241
01:41:56,153 --> 01:41:58,906
was behind Project Starfish
the whole time.

1242
01:42:33,858 --> 01:42:34,942
Whoa. Whoa.

1243
01:42:50,207 --> 01:42:51,792
I think it's trying to get out.

1244
01:42:51,959 --> 01:42:53,669
- What?
- Starro the...

1245
01:43:16,859 --> 01:43:17,860
Whoa.

1246
01:44:26,971 --> 01:44:29,140
Cover your faces!

1247
01:45:17,104 --> 01:45:18,105
<i>Si.</i>

1248
01:45:18,647 --> 01:45:19,690
<i>Si.</i>

1249
01:45:52,598 --> 01:45:54,767
- Whoa.
- What the fuck is that?

1250
01:45:54,850 --> 01:45:56,393
Uh... Hey, guys?

1251
01:45:59,146 --> 01:46:00,731
Oh, shit, there's...

1252
01:46:19,458 --> 01:46:21,627
This city is mine.

1253
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:55,160
Uh, Miss Waller,
I think the feed is back up.

1254
01:46:57,413 --> 01:46:59,623
Oh, my God, Miss Waller!

1255
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:02,209
We've got a freaking <i>kaiju</i>
up in this shit!

1256
01:47:11,427 --> 01:47:12,904
<i>Task Force X, come in.</i>

1257
01:47:12,928 --> 01:47:14,388
<i>Are you there?</i>

1258
01:47:17,016 --> 01:47:18,392
Uh-huh.

1259
01:47:18,559 --> 01:47:19,768
<i>Whatever signal jammers</i>

1260
01:47:19,935 --> 01:47:21,228
were blocking our communications

1261
01:47:21,312 --> 01:47:23,206
must have been in the building
you just demolished.

1262
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:26,191
Yeah, well, we've got a mite issue
over here, Waller.

1263
01:47:26,358 --> 01:47:28,485
It's Project Starfish, Miss Waller.

1264
01:47:28,652 --> 01:47:29,945
It's headed towards the city,

1265
01:47:30,029 --> 01:47:32,948
and I think it wants to feed
on as many people as it can.

1266
01:47:37,244 --> 01:47:38,329
<i>Not our problem.</i>

1267
01:47:38,495 --> 01:47:40,831
<i>If you've destroyed Jotunheim
and the records within,</i>

1268
01:47:40,914 --> 01:47:42,416
<i>you've achieved the objective.</i>

1269
01:47:42,583 --> 01:47:45,085
<i>Corto Maltese is no longer a U.S. ally.</i>

1270
01:47:45,252 --> 01:47:46,892
If anything,
the White House will consider

1271
01:47:46,962 --> 01:47:48,797
fomenting disruption in a hostile nation

1272
01:47:48,964 --> 01:47:50,174
a positive development.

1273
01:48:23,791 --> 01:48:25,209
You heard what she said.

1274
01:48:46,438 --> 01:48:47,439
Fuck.

1275
01:48:53,112 --> 01:48:54,863
Bloodsport is off mission.

1276
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:56,115
What the...

1277
01:48:57,199 --> 01:48:58,826
She'll kill you, you know.

1278
01:48:58,992 --> 01:49:00,202
That's her business.

1279
01:49:01,036 --> 01:49:03,872
I knew Sebastian sensed good in you
for a reason.

1280
01:49:04,039 --> 01:49:06,333
Just keep that fucking rat away from me.

1281
01:49:06,667 --> 01:49:08,252
Ratcatcher is also off mission.

1282
01:49:08,752 --> 01:49:10,003
Bloodsport, Ratcatcher,

1283
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:12,673
<i>- turn around.</i>
- Where go, friends?

1284
01:49:13,382 --> 01:49:14,633
<i>Nanaue!</i>

1285
01:49:16,135 --> 01:49:18,637
I know what I'm carrying
the javelin for.

1286
01:49:28,897 --> 01:49:30,315
Krill, turn around now!

1287
01:49:30,482 --> 01:49:32,693
<i>Turn back now, God damn it!</i>

1288
01:49:35,404 --> 01:49:36,613
- Open it.
- Miss Waller...

1289
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:37,780
Open it!

1290
01:49:39,533 --> 01:49:41,201
What are you doing, Task Force X?

1291
01:49:46,457 --> 01:49:48,041
Fuck!

1292
01:49:50,544 --> 01:49:51,879
Turn around now, God damn it!

1293
01:49:52,045 --> 01:49:54,756
<i>You dumb pieces of shit!</i>

1294
01:49:54,923 --> 01:49:56,216
<i>Motherfuckers!</i>

1295
01:49:57,759 --> 01:50:00,220
<i>God damn it, Task Force X,
this is your last</i>

1296
01:50:00,387 --> 01:50:02,389
motherfucking warning!

1297
01:50:06,602 --> 01:50:10,105
Oh, my God!
What the fuck did you do?

1298
01:50:11,523 --> 01:50:13,108
All those people, John.

1299
01:50:14,026 --> 01:50:15,235
Little kids.

1300
01:50:19,907 --> 01:50:24,119
Task Force X, the creature is headed
to Calle Principal.

1301
01:50:24,286 --> 01:50:25,454
Avoid Avenida Medrano,

1302
01:50:25,621 --> 01:50:27,581
- there is a swarm of infected.
- Jesus.

1303
01:50:27,748 --> 01:50:31,335
So, your clearest path is Calle Aguero.

1304
01:50:31,502 --> 01:50:34,296
Get on the satellite, Dale,
you fucking dickhead!

1305
01:50:34,463 --> 01:50:35,881
Yes, ma'am.

1306
01:51:58,130 --> 01:51:59,423
Huh?

1307
01:52:04,678 --> 01:52:06,555
Harley, take the high ground!

1308
01:52:12,894 --> 01:52:16,607
Nanaue! Monster is nom nom!

1309
01:52:16,773 --> 01:52:19,234
Monster nom nom?

1310
01:52:19,693 --> 01:52:20,693
Yes!

1311
01:52:29,494 --> 01:52:31,663
Abner, do you see who that is?

1312
01:52:31,747 --> 01:52:33,498
Huh?

1313
01:52:33,665 --> 01:52:35,208
It's your mom!

1314
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:10,911
I'm a superhero!

1315
01:53:11,495 --> 01:53:13,664
I'm a motherfucking super...

1316
01:54:03,338 --> 01:54:04,965
God!

1317
01:54:10,595 --> 01:54:14,641
<i>No! No!</i>

1318
01:54:32,075 --> 01:54:33,368
Oh, no...

1319
01:54:41,376 --> 01:54:43,628
This city

1320
01:54:43,795 --> 01:54:47,382
is mine!

1321
01:54:48,091 --> 01:54:50,135
This city isn't yours.

1322
01:54:51,261 --> 01:54:53,764
This city isn't ours.

1323
01:54:54,347 --> 01:54:56,475
This city is theirs.

1324
01:55:00,479 --> 01:55:02,022
Oh, hell.

1325
01:56:21,601 --> 01:56:23,228
Why rats, Papa?

1326
01:56:24,354 --> 01:56:28,483
Rats are the lowliest and most despised
of all creatures, my love.

1327
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:31,194
If they have purpose...

1328
01:56:32,821 --> 01:56:34,531
so do we all.

1329
01:58:20,637 --> 01:58:22,806
I was happy,

1330
01:58:22,973 --> 01:58:27,477
floating, staring at the stars.

1331
01:59:01,011 --> 01:59:02,530
<i>A group of escaped convicts</i>

1332
01:59:02,554 --> 01:59:03,555
<i>saved a city of millions</i>

1333
01:59:03,638 --> 01:59:07,559
<i>on the small island nation
of Corto Maltese today.</i>

1334
01:59:07,726 --> 01:59:08,810
That's my dad.

1335
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:11,914
<i>Because of these people,</i>

1336
01:59:11,938 --> 01:59:15,066
<i>Corto Maltese will have
free democratic elections</i>

1337
01:59:15,150 --> 01:59:17,944
<i>- for the first time in 90 years.
- Viva</i>

1338
01:59:18,153 --> 01:59:20,947
<i>Corto Maltese! Viva...</i>

1339
01:59:21,114 --> 01:59:23,324
<i>Corto Maltese! Viva...</i>

1340
01:59:23,491 --> 01:59:25,577
<i>Corto Maltese! Viva...</i>

1341
01:59:25,744 --> 01:59:28,246
- That's my dad.
<i>- ...Corto Maltese! Viva...</i>

1342
01:59:36,588 --> 01:59:37,839
Yeah.

1343
01:59:40,508 --> 01:59:41,508
Yeah.

1344
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:44,846
<i>Oh, that's just a taste
of what's on that drive.</i>

1345
01:59:45,013 --> 01:59:47,307
<i>I've uploaded it all to a secure server.</i>

1346
01:59:48,266 --> 01:59:50,143
<i>Now, if you kill any one of us,</i>

1347
01:59:50,310 --> 01:59:52,312
or my daughter ever sees
the inside of a prison,

1348
01:59:52,479 --> 01:59:53,730
it goes public.

1349
01:59:53,897 --> 01:59:55,356
If we all go free,

1350
01:59:55,523 --> 01:59:57,442
it never has to see the light of day.

1351
01:59:59,069 --> 02:00:01,613
I told you
I'd make you a leader, DuBois.

1352
02:00:02,906 --> 02:00:04,282
<i>You got a deal.</i>

1353
02:00:24,385 --> 02:00:25,553
Nanaue.

1354
02:00:41,486 --> 02:00:43,822
Look, I know Flag wanted
to give the drive to the press,

1355
02:00:43,988 --> 02:00:47,575
but we just saved a whole bloody city.
We can't have it all.

1356
02:00:50,495 --> 02:00:51,663
Flag was my friend.

1357
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:53,248
Mine too.

1358
02:00:54,999 --> 02:00:56,918
And I haven't got many of those.

1359
02:00:59,212 --> 02:01:01,422
I could be your friend, Milton.

1360
02:01:01,923 --> 02:01:02,924
Not my name.

1361
02:01:03,258 --> 02:01:04,676
What?

1362
02:01:04,843 --> 02:01:07,011
What are you talkin' about?
We just had a conversation

1363
02:01:07,095 --> 02:01:09,305
for, like, three hours
about how your name is Milton.

1364
02:01:09,472 --> 02:01:10,723
Didn't.

1365
02:01:10,807 --> 02:01:12,183
Yes, we did.

1366
02:01:12,350 --> 02:01:14,394
No. Our ride's here.

1367
02:01:14,477 --> 02:01:16,271
Hmm.

1368
02:01:18,189 --> 02:01:19,440
Nom nom?

1369
02:01:19,607 --> 02:01:20,607
Really?

1370
02:01:20,608 --> 02:01:22,652
That is what you're
thinkin' about right now?

1371
02:01:22,819 --> 02:01:25,113
No. That nom nom though.

1372
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:26,823
No, it's not nom nom.

1373
02:01:28,867 --> 02:01:30,201
No!

1374
02:01:40,837 --> 02:01:42,037
<i>I don't care about a fancy car</i>

1375
02:01:44,257 --> 02:01:46,759
<i>Unless it's taking me to you</i>

1376
02:01:47,844 --> 02:01:51,222
<i>And I don't care about how far you are</i>

1377
02:01:51,639 --> 02:01:55,810
<i>You know I'll always come through
for you</i>

1378
02:02:09,199 --> 02:02:12,493
<i>I don't wanna miss
another birthday party</i>

1379
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:15,747
<i>Or any day in between</i>

1380
02:02:16,372 --> 02:02:19,876
<i>I picture us holding hands
when we're older</i>

1381
02:02:20,084 --> 02:02:22,587
<i>Though it's probably just a dream</i>

1382
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:26,591
<i>'Cause life is so busted</i>

1383
02:02:26,674 --> 02:02:29,969
<i>Life is so busted</i>

1384
02:02:30,053 --> 02:02:33,765
<i>My car is so busted</i>

1385
02:02:33,848 --> 02:02:36,976
<i>Life I'm so busted</i>

1386
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:40,730
<i>And I just wanted to be loved by you
by you</i>

1387
02:02:42,607 --> 02:02:44,609
<i>I just wanted to be loved by you, by you</i>

1388
02:02:44,692 --> 02:02:48,071
<i>I just wanted to be loved by you</i>

<i>Take another hit to the diaphragm</i>

1391
02:03:55,972 --> 02:03:57,682
<i>I never drew the diagram</i>

02:03:57,765 --> 02:04:01,477
<i>How to deal with this shit

1393
02:04:01,853 --> 02:04:03,771
<i>You're my dream, you're my nightmare</i>

1394
02:04:03,855 --> 02:04:07,233
<i>Life is a bitch, she don't fight fair
Leave you right there</i>

1395
02:04:07,317 --> 02:04:10,111
<i>I was hoping
that you'd notice my despair</i>

1396
02:04:10,194 --> 02:04:13,156
<i>Run away from the pain
I don't care, 'cause</i>

1397
02:04:14,198 --> 02:04:18,953
<i>First they incite the violence</i>

1398
02:04:19,037 --> 02:04:24,625
<i>Turn around and then
they invite the silence</i>

1399
02:04:24,709 --> 02:04:30,840
<i>Burn it down and I think I need

02:04:43,436 --> 02:04:46,814
<i>I'm back to the black again

<i>So I stick, poke with my kinfolk</i>

1414
02:05:12,382 --> 02:05:16,803
<i>Gimme drink, smoke

02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:30,775

<i>Oh no! Oh no!</i>

1421
02:05:36,823 --> 02:05:40,201
<i>I'm back to the black again

02:05:52,046 --> 02:05:54,382
<i>Oh no! Oh no!</i>

1427
02:10:53,973 --> 02:10:55,766
Said they found him in the rubble.

1428
02:10:55,933 --> 02:10:57,733
They were shocked
his heart was still beating.

1429
02:10:57,852 --> 02:11:00,396
I wasn't certain how safe it was,
shipping him back here.

1430
02:11:00,563 --> 02:11:03,691
But, if anything,
he's shown he's resilient.

1431
02:11:03,774 --> 02:11:07,486
It'll take some surgery, but eventually
we'll get him back up to speed.

1432
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:11,073
You realize this is revenge, right?

1433
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:12,658
Waller knows we double-crossed her,

1434
02:11:12,825 --> 02:11:16,120
and she's getting back at us
by saddling us with this douchebag.

1435
02:11:16,287 --> 02:11:17,371
Yep.

1436
02:11:17,663 --> 02:11:19,957
I heard he was sort of a hero
down in Corto Maltese.

1437
02:11:20,124 --> 02:11:22,293
Oh, is that what you heard?
