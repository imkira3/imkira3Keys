It's been a while since our last date,
Batman. I thought you'd forsaken me.

12

Crime fighting leaves little time

But you're never far from my thoughts.

first, Batman. We make a pretty good team,

You see, in a criminal,

43
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:53,591
the psyche's battle
between good and evil is often one-sided

44

but what if there was a way
to remove the evil?

45

the evil out of super criminals

would make our jobs a lot easier.

314
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:30,100
Tut can someday be
a productive member of society.

315
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:34,312
So you are saying the only hope to ridding
Gotham of the scourge of King Tut

316
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:38,567
is to send him to prison where he can
get the help he so desperately needs?

317
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,194
- Well, I...
- No further questions.

318
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:45,615
Your Honor, I'd like to call
Professor McElroy to the stand.

319
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,409
(GASPS)

320
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:52,205
Professor, you stated for the court that
you have no memory of your actions

321
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,457
when King Tut takes over.

322
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:58,879
None whatsoever. No one is more
horrified by King Tut's actions than I.

323
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:03,300
But isn't it true that
without your expertise in Egyptology,

324
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,218
Tut couldn't commit his crimes?

325
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:07,345
Well, I suppose that's true, but...

326
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:11,474
Thereby making you the real
mastermind behind his schemes.

327
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,351
Homina homina homina.

328
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,396
No further questions, Your Honor.

(GLASSES CLINK)

330
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:25,614
Fifteen years with possible
time off for good behavior.

331
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,616
Tough break for the professor.

332
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:31,328
Yes, poor devil. Still, justice was served.

333
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,664
At this rate, you'll be lead DA again
in no time, Harvey.

334
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:38,627
Batman nabs the super crooks,
and I send them to the state pen.

335
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,921
The same place Batman sent you.

336
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:44,758
Why, Dick, I hope you don't feel like
a third wheel when I'm around.

337
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,385
After all, I'm only Bruce's best friend.

338
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,763
You're his ward.

339
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,600
But the truth is,
if it wasn't for Batman's help

340
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:59,230
or Bruce's friendship during my dark time,
who knows where I'd be right now?

341
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,066
Robbing a bank?

342
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:08,198
Oh, my! Two handsome bachelors who are
still best friends after all these years?

343
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,494
Oh! It's enough to give a girl the vapors.

344
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:15,997
Anyway, it's time I confessed to
the other reason for my visit.

345
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,207
Go on.

346
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:20,251
There is a charity that's dear to my heart,

347
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:24,047
the Society for Underprivileged
Fraternal Twins.

348
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,465
A worthy cause.

349
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:28,134
The stigma of being the less-attractive twin

350
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,845
is a heavy burden no one should have to bear.

351
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:32,472
Of course I'll do it.

352
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:38,478
Marvelous. I've already found the venue.
The newly refurbished Winning Pair Casino.

353
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:39,896
It'll be great fun.

354
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,149
It's the Bat-phone, sir.

If you'll excuse us, Harv. Dick and I
are due at our weekly badminton lesson.

Holy... Gosh, yes, you're right.

357
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,910
Of course, Bruce. I'll be in touch.

358
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,581
Pigs in a blanket, Mr. Dent?

359
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,251
Yes, Commissioner?

360
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:06,256
Batman, an odd package has arrived
at my office, explicitly addressed to you.

361
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,466
Curious. We'll be right there.

362
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,843
To the Batcave!

363
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:15,598
- It's a book.
- A world atlas to be precise.

It can only be from
that master of a thousand stolen plots.

368
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,071
- The Bookworm.
- Indeed.

369
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,783
Come, Robin, we have some reading
to catch up on.

370
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:43,418
Why would Bookworm give us a world atlas?

371
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,128
Despite its poor condition,

372
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:49,132
I was able to
detect several pages were missing.

373
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:52,135
Pages of different world capitals.

374
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:54,137
I'm still stumped, Batman.

375
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:57,098
Think. Longitudes and latitudes.

376
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,978
ROBIN: <i>Holy overdue book! Of course!</i>

377
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,815
He's using longitudes and latitudes

378
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:08,985
to correspond to
the library's classification method.

380

Now you've got it, old chum.

381
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,326
Based on my encyclopedic knowledge
of the card catalog,

382
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:19,412
those numbers correspond to rare editions

426
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:12,418
Bookworm knew nothing about the clue
that was sent to Commissioner Gordon.

00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:16,172
Which is why I suspect
someone wanted us to catch 'em.

00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:19,342
You mean there's another
fiendish force behind these crimes?

But who?

430
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:25,265
Think, Robin. What common theme
do the stolen books all share?

Hmm.

They were all stories
featuring themes of duality.

I see Tut's crimes, though Egyptian
themed, also focused on the number two.

434
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,070
The biplane, the double-decker bus.

435

The number two? A double-cross.

01:02:58,526 --> 01:03:00,194
You did this.

953
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,530
I'll destroy you.

954
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:05,283
No, he's my friend.

955
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,410
He believed in me when no one else would.

956
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:09,537
He was a fool to trust us.

957
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:12,498
There's no us anymore, Two-Face.

958
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:16,210
I'm Harvey Dent... (GRUNTS)

959
01:03:16,377 --> 01:03:18,296
District Attorney... (GRUNTS)

960
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:21,507
And I'm bringing you to justice. (GROANS)

961
01:03:23,009 --> 01:03:24,719
(GRUNTING)

962
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:28,973
(GROANING)

963
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:32,059
Harvey!

964
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:54,665
Batman. Bruce, old friend.

965
01:03:58,753 --> 01:04:00,713
BATMAN: Let's get out of here, Harvey.

966
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:19,774
Batman, are you all right?

967
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:21,484
- I'm fine, Robin.
- (SIRENS BLARING)

968
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:23,110
What about Two-Face?

969
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:25,279
He's gone, Boy Wonder.

970
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,740
He's... (GROANS)

971
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:44,298
GORDON: Batman, we rounded up
all of the super criminals.

972
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:46,133
But Catwoman's gone.

973
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,177
That tricky minx.

974
01:04:48,344 --> 01:04:51,305
Still, Robin and I owe our lives to her.

975
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:56,060
However were you able to outwit that
Grand Guignol gonzo, Two-Face?

976
01:04:56,352 --> 01:04:58,938
I'm afraid to say I cheated, Commissioner.

977
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:02,817
During our fight,
I replaced Two-Face's coin with a blank.

978
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:06,445
His inability to act
gave me the opening I needed.

979
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:08,864
That poor abandoned soul.

980
01:05:09,115 --> 01:05:11,992
But even Harvey Dent must again
pay for his crimes

981
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:14,036
no matter what his mental state.

982
01:05:14,203 --> 01:05:17,498
True, but for now,
there's quite a mess in Gotham

983
01:05:17,665 --> 01:05:18,833
we must clean up.

984
01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:29,301
Initiating Bat-evil-essence antidote bombs.

985
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:30,511
(BEEPING)

986
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:32,596
(BOMBS WHISTLING)

987
01:05:49,155 --> 01:05:51,699
- (CONTINUES FIRING)
- Take that, you two-faced fiends!

988
01:05:51,866 --> 01:05:55,536
Decorum, old chum,
they are citizens after all.

989
01:05:56,203 --> 01:05:58,372
Gosh, yes. Sorry, Batman.

990
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,166
(CONTINUES FIRING)

991
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:03,669
Batman's cured all of Gotham.

992
01:06:03,836 --> 01:06:05,838
That is, most of Gotham.

993
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:08,716
(GROWLING)

994
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:12,511
- (BOMB WHISTLING)
- (GRUNTS)

995
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:19,894
Faith and begorrah. I feel like I've been
on a three-day bender.

996
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,486
GORDON: No matter how dire the peril,

997
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:31,197
no matter how hopeless the odds,

998
01:06:31,906 --> 01:06:34,408
you can always count on Batman.

999
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,668
Gosh, Bruce, it's been months.

1000
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,296
How do you think Harvey will act
when he sees us?

1001
01:06:47,463 --> 01:06:49,840
The warden says
Harvey's been a model prisoner.

1002
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:52,593
I mean, about him
knowing our secret identities.

1003
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:57,097
This is one time I'm afraid
even Batman doesn't know what to expect.

1004
01:06:57,264 --> 01:07:01,810
Master Bruce, Mr. Dent has arrived
for his charity bachelor auction.

1005
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:14,114
Thanks, Bruce.

1006
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:17,701
Once again, you've helped me
in ways I can never begin to repay.

1007
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:21,830
Ah, don't mention it, Harvey,
that's what old friends are for.

1008
01:07:21,997 --> 01:07:23,707
Say, I'd better get up there.

1009
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:27,086
Holy amnesia! He doesn't remember.

1010
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:28,629
Two-Face knew our secret,

1011
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:32,174
but it seems Harvey has
repressed that memory.

1012
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:36,136
Clearly, Two-Face lies dormant,
buried deep in Harvey's psyche.

1013
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:39,014
For now, we can only hope it stays that way.

1014
01:07:39,265 --> 01:07:41,016
(CROWD CHEERING)

1015
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:47,690
I wonder if Harvey
will be auctioning himself.

1016
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:50,776
(LAUGHING) Oh!

1017
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:53,737
I might need to borrow some money, Alfred.

1018
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:55,281
Why, Mrs. Cooper.

1019
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:59,493
Heavens to Betsy, I'm all a tingle, Bruce.

1020
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:00,744
Bruce?

1021
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:03,998
HARVEY: <i>Thank you for that warm welcome.</i>

1022
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:05,332
<i>And now, without further ado,</i>

1023
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:08,335
I'd like to present
our first item up for auction,

1024
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:12,673
the most eligible bachelor in Gotham City,

1025
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:16,010
Batman.

1026
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,511
(ALL GASPS)

1027
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,722
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

1028
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:23,183
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

1029
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:26,520
Who will make the first bid?

1030
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:32,610
Holy Hugh Hefner!

1031
01:08:33,694 --> 01:08:35,404
Meow.
