1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,514
Fast bike, huh?

3
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:09,892
Yeah, sometimes.

4
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:12,144
Want me to fill it up?

5
00:02:12,353 --> 00:02:14,939
I'm not here for the gas.

6
00:02:15,397 --> 00:02:17,691
You can keep an eye on it for me.

7
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:51,392
Leave it on the road, guys.

8
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,895
That stunt almost cost me my ride, boy.

9
00:02:55,354 --> 00:02:59,400
-You were in my way. I was in a hurry.
-Well, now you'll be late.

10
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:03,404
Hey! Get your dirty little punk ass
off my car.

11
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:10,119
What is it about driving cars
that makes you all such assholes?

12
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:40,983
Can you do something
about these dirty windows?

13
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:43,485
Five bucks.

14
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:45,321
Make it 1 0.

15
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,327
Thanks.

16
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:54,538
Buckle up.

17
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:06,634
Well. It didn't take long
for you to find trouble.

18
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:10,387
Step up. I'm running
a two-for-one special today.

19
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:12,515
Special, huh?

20
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,687
Can I get fries with that?
Because I'm hungry as hell.

21
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:22,691
-What's up, Ford? How you doing, boy?
-Good to see you, man.

22
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,486
-Wish I could say the same for you.
-Welcome home.

23
00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:29,532
Thanks, man.
Val, Dalton. Late as usual.

24
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:33,827
Dude's gone six months in Thailand
without a word...

25
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,746
...and now he's busting our chops.

26
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:38,290
Since when did you get so sensitive?

27
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:40,042
I got a rally to get to.

28
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,044
You must be in a hurry to die.

29
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:46,048
Henry James and his boys aren't gonna be
as happy to see you as we are.

30
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:49,885
-You were on the run. Why you back now?
-I gotta make things right.

31
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:54,557
I couldn't stop thinking about her.

32
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:58,894
-And here I thought it was all about us.
-Look...

33
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:03,148
...this is my mess, not yours.
You don't have to make this run.

34
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:06,777
-We can't let you have all the fun.
-You're gonna need us.

35
00:05:09,864 --> 00:05:11,657
Yes, I am.

36
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:13,617
Still know how to ride that thing?

37
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:16,245
We'll have to race
the twisties to find out.

38
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:21,208
Ford, what the hell are you doing?

39
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:25,129
I don't want to miss that look
on your face when I blow past you.

40
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,343
What the--?

41
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:50,941
-We got company.
-Out of my way, punk!

42
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:57,740
What's his problem?

43
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:01,619
I got him!

44
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:08,834
-Your ass is mine.
-Let's go, punk.

45
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:11,420
Come on, what you got?

46
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:14,381
-You like that?
-Bring that piece of shit on.

47
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:38,781
I'm burning, I'm burning.

48
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:46,038
-Relax!
-You should've let him burn!

49
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:47,581
He could've killed us!

50
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:52,044
Hey, punk, we ain't done yet.
Move out of the way.

51
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:55,047
Let's see if this guy fights
as bad as he rides.

52
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:57,842
-Walk away.
-You got loud pipes...

53
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,094
...but you ain't saying nothing!

54
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:02,179
You ain't gonna like how this ends.

55
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:24,451
It's your turn to burn, white boy.

56
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:38,883
What's up, J? Drop something?

57
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:41,302
Just taking care of some business, T.

58
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:49,226
Ford. I heard you was up in lndochina
eating sushi and shit.

59
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,065
-I thought sushi came from Japan.
-I know where sushi come from, nigga.

60
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:58,068
I ain't even talking to you.

61
00:10:01,906 --> 00:10:04,909
You know I could smash you right now.

62
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:07,161
You and your little tricycle friends.

63
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:11,332
But I'm gonna give you a pass.

64
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,710
Consider it a welcome-home present.

65
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:20,341
Under one condition. Somebody gonna
give my brother a new bike.

66
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:23,469
-I want his bike.
-I ain't giving you shit.

67
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:33,229
There's only one way
you're getting one of these bikes.

68
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:39,944
I know you been gone a long time, Ford.

69
00:10:40,152 --> 00:10:43,405
But not long enough to forget
who run things around here.

70
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:48,494
I hate to see you end up as Dojo's dinner.

71
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:51,080
Trey. One-time.

72
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,711
Probably not a good time
to be feeding Dojo anything, huh?

73
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,257
Get that bike from you later.

74
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,889
Hey, officer, how's it going?

75
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:11,225
Beautiful day today.

76
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,771
-What are you waiting for?
-What you think?

77
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,857
Go show these boys how to ride.

78
00:12:00,065 --> 00:12:03,068
-How about a ride?
-This thing might be too much for you.

79
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:06,155
-We'll never know till I'm on it.
-All right, you too.

80
00:12:06,322 --> 00:12:09,325
It's not that I don't enjoy your company.

81
00:12:10,075 --> 00:12:11,368
Just be gentle with him.

82
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:18,709
-Nice bike.
-Nice ass.

83
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:21,170
Got a name?

84
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:23,172
Yeah.

85
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:35,559
Ford. What's he doing here?

86
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:50,032
Forecast for today:
sun, sun and more sun.

87
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:53,702
Highs 94 to 103.
Don 't forget your sunscreen, folks.

88
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:58,332
Southwest winds 10 to 15 miles per hour,
with locally higher gusts.

89
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:11,053
Be with you in a second.

90
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:14,223
Looking for something in particular?

91
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:18,811
You got one of them seats
in a pink Naugahyde?

92
00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:20,896
Maybe with a little gold fringe?

93
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,733
You never were funny, Ford.

94
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:27,862
Oh, come on, you used to think
I was funny.

95
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,905
Maybe you lost your sense of humor.

96
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:33,033
I think I have a pretty good
sense of humor.

97
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:36,579
Like the morning you skipped town
before agents raided my shop...

98
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:39,915
...waving warrants, telling me
my boyfriend's a drug dealer?

99
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:43,294
That was funny.
I laughed my ass off for weeks.

100
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:45,713
I wrote you letters.

101
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:49,091
-I made fires.
-I tried to call.

102
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,928
Y eah, but my phone was tapped
for six months. That was fun too.

103
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:56,724
-Can I explain?
-Let me guess.

104
00:13:56,891 --> 00:14:00,603
You're sorry, you didn't mean to hurt me,
you were trying to protect me...

105
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:03,814
-...and it wasn't your fault.
-lt was my fault.

106
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:05,816
-We're closed.
-The sign said--

107
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:09,778
Well, the sign lied. Thanks.

108
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:12,406
You too, Ford.

109
00:14:16,535 --> 00:14:18,454
You don't know how many times
I've...

110
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:21,415
...played this out in my head
the last six months.

111
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,293
Must be frustrating.

112
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,590
You got balls even coming here.

113
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:34,595
Feds and the Hellions are after you and
Henry James thinks you stole his bikes.

114
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:36,096
Yeah.

115
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:40,809
Well, that's because I did.

116
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:44,438
-Ford?
-Yeah?

117
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:48,067
-Go now, please, before l--
-Before what?

118
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,512
And to think we almost decided
to go to the beach this weekend.

119
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,182
Lucky for me, Luther hates to swim.

120
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:26,146
Henry.

121
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:30,442
I don't know why
you're buying a new seat, Ford.

122
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:33,237
Looks like you haven't
broken in your old one yet.

123
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:36,699
Looks like Ford prefers to ride bitch to me.

124
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:40,494
It looks to me like you ought
to buy a new seat yourself, Henry.

125
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:46,709
Share one with your friends long enough
and you're liable to catch something.

126
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:08,522
Heard you were in lndochina.

127
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:11,233
Some shit like that.

128
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:14,945
-Good food there?
-Thailand, actually...

129
00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:17,615
...but the food was great.
Thanks for asking.

130
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:20,075
You're a pretty funny guy, Ford.

131
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,579
Tell me...

132
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:25,915
...you got a punch line for this:

133
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:29,210
Where are my goddamn bikes?

134
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:31,504
You really want them...

135
00:16:33,464 --> 00:16:35,007
...or what's inside them?

136
00:16:38,594 --> 00:16:40,888
Where are they?

137
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:46,560
-Why don't you just cut it out of him.
-No, he won't.

138
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:50,064
He's too smart for that.

139
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:54,318
Because he knows if he touches me
he'll never get his shit back.

140
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:56,362
Then again...

141
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,822
...I'm not that smart.

142
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:00,783
Shane.

143
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:12,670
You've got till sundown
to hand over my bikes.

144
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:45,661
-Your brother said we had a deal.
-Junior don't do deals around here, I do.

145
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:51,917
Well, if Junior ain't allowed to make deals,
he shouldn't be allowed to speak.

146
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:57,131
That's funny, because I was
thinking the same thing.

147
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:03,470
I didn't come here to watch you
pet your dog, primate.

148
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,348
I didn't invite your Dukes of Hazzard ass.

149
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:10,769
So you can raise up whenever you feel it.
The answer is no.

150
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:13,814
You're not slinging your dope
on my streets.

151
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:19,195
Hand me that bottle.

152
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:21,197
Look...

153
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:25,201
... I'm not some dimebag street punk.

154
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,203
I'm a businessman.

155
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:32,041
And I'm telling you to make this right.

156
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,378
I wouldn't give a shit
if you was Don Corleone himself.

157
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:39,173
The answer is still no.

158
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:41,091
So get out of my face.

159
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:51,977
What the hell was you looking at?

160
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:54,897
I love you.

161
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:59,777
Trey, what's wrong? I thought you
would've been down with that shit.

162
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:01,779
You could've made a killing.

163
00:19:01,946 --> 00:19:05,991
First you gonna act a fool
up there on the road, now this?

164
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:07,618
What's wrong with you?

165
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:11,413
You messing with
my goddamn good nature, boy.

166
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:15,209
Go get me a beer, man.
You messing up my buzz.

167
00:19:16,252 --> 00:19:19,255
Get me a Diet Pepsi. Don't slam my door.

168
00:19:19,463 --> 00:19:21,924
You better count to 1 0!

169
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:26,387
-I'm gonna whup his ass.
-Shut up. Put Rasan and Nomo on him.

170
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:28,764
Dojo got more sense than that boy.

171
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,942
Henry, looks like
you're the one riding bitch.

172
00:19:58,502 --> 00:20:01,505
Looks like your engine
could use a little work.

173
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:05,342
What part of "l don't love you
anymore, you're a bastard...

174
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:08,637
...and I never wanna see you again"
didn't you understand?

175
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,058
How about the part that stops you
from driving off right now?

176
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:40,544
Thirsty?

177
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:04,735
All right, one beer. But you' re buying.

178
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,917
-What up, Junior? You all right?
-No, l' m definitely not all right. Move!

179
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:45,609
Watch out, white boy.

180
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:48,279
-Call it an accident?
-How about I kick your ass?

181
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:50,865
No, I prefer we still call it an accident.

182
00:21:51,782 --> 00:21:54,910
-How about now?
-Now it looks like you owe me a beer.

183
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:57,955
-Junior! Junior!
-I'm gonna kill you!

184
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:00,207
Come on, chill!

185
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:27,318
I'm gonna talk to you. Why you always
got to show your ass, man, huh?

186
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:29,945
Why you can't come here
and play your position?

187
00:22:30,154 --> 00:22:31,780
Look at me, boy.

188
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:35,618
I love you. You're my brother,
but you better stop embarrassing me.

189
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:38,162
Stop acting so damn crazy.

190
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,373
And I got your back for life.

191
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:46,212
Well, if you got my back, then show me,
blood, on everything!

192
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,633
You ain't got my back, man. You ain't
got my back, Trey. Forget you, man.

193
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:53,010
Watch out. Get out of my way, man.

194
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:57,431
Dawson's Creek almost beat
your brother's ass, blood.

195
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,559
Shut up, man. Go get my dog.

196
00:23:00,768 --> 00:23:04,146
-What're we gonna do about Ford?
-Junior just solved our problem.

197
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:07,733
-Why don't we just grab him right now?
-No, not now.

198
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:11,320
I got a better idea. Get the boys.

199
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:16,158
What is it with you, Ford? Everywhere
you go, everything turns to hell.

200
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,828
Yeah, it's a talent I have.

201
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,546
Go powder your nose, China.

202
00:23:33,884 --> 00:23:35,845
Let's have some fun.

203
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:54,947
-That's him. Get him.
-There he is.

204
00:24:02,496 --> 00:24:06,959
We'd like to thank the Hellions for
messing up another gig. I'm out of here.

205
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:09,336
He ain't going anywhere.

206
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:11,881
-Here he comes.
-There he goes. Get him!

207
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,175
See you, Junior.

208
00:24:37,907 --> 00:24:40,075
Hey, what's up, man?

209
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:44,747
Hey. What's up?

210
00:24:45,956 --> 00:24:48,000
Hey, dude.

211
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:54,632
Damn!

212
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:01,305
You screwed me, Junior.

213
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:06,810
I assume you're apologizing
for setting up a deal you couldn't do.

214
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,400
I made promises based on your black ass.

215
00:25:20,825 --> 00:25:24,537
And now I've got a problem.

216
00:25:26,372 --> 00:25:29,625
-But you're gonna help me out of it.
-Yo, dog.

217
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:34,255
Just give me time. I'm gonna talk to Trey.
We could work this out, man.

218
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:36,924
I could make this happen, all right?

219
00:25:38,175 --> 00:25:40,344
Time's up.

220
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:55,317
You know what to do, baby?

221
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,700
There's this one road that winds up
the coast from Bangkok to Pattani.

222
00:26:03,534 --> 00:26:06,287
It's got mountains on one side,
ocean on the other...

223
00:26:06,453 --> 00:26:10,332
...so close sometimes it feels like
you can just drag your foot in it.

224
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,756
I tell you, the last six months, every time
I took that drive I thought about you.

225
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:21,010
Did you come all this way
to sell me a trip to Thailand?

226
00:26:23,637 --> 00:26:26,473
You got to the bottom of this beer.
Explain away.

227
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:30,102
All right.

228
00:26:30,311 --> 00:26:35,649
First met Henry about a year ago. I didn't
like him, but he was a paying customer.

229
00:26:35,816 --> 00:26:38,736
I fixed his chopper a couple times.

230
00:26:48,913 --> 00:26:53,792
Six months ago,
he turns up at your shop...

231
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:57,546
...with these two bikes. He asked me
if I'd mind looking after them.

232
00:26:57,755 --> 00:26:59,298
I figure,
what the hell, right?

233
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:01,592
So I do.

234
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:06,972
Then I go to move them, they don't start.
So I check the tanks.

235
00:27:07,223 --> 00:27:10,059
They're filled with kilos of crystal meth.

236
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:12,645
So first thing, I get them out of there.

237
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:17,233
So that's why that fed McPherson
raided my shop after you split.

238
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:21,362
And you dropped off
the face of the Earth.

239
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:26,659
I took off...

240
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:30,871
...so that you wouldn't get dragged into it.

241
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:34,583
I split.

242
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:37,753
Now I'm the only one involved with Henry.

243
00:27:37,962 --> 00:27:39,672
So you left to protect me?

244
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:45,052
What'd you think, you were gonna just
come back and explain everything...

245
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:49,306
...and then we'd just ride off
into the sunset together?

246
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,947
More or less.

247
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,826
Well, which is it? More or less?

248
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:14,039
Well, I was actually thinking Mexico.

249
00:28:39,857 --> 00:28:41,817
-You're killing me.
-Get your gear on.

250
00:28:41,984 --> 00:28:44,653
-Not a good time.
-Heading to Cabo. Shane's coming.

251
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,363
-Damn, really?
-Yeah.

252
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,746
-Give me 1 0 minutes, all right?
-Come on.

253
00:28:56,749 --> 00:28:58,542
Move.

254
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:01,337
Move, man! Move!

255
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,048
Damn!

256
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:07,510
Wait. That's my brother, man.

257
00:29:07,718 --> 00:29:09,261
It's all right.

258
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:14,475
Oh, no. No, man.
I'm taking him with me.

259
00:29:14,683 --> 00:29:16,519
You can't do that, son.

260
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:23,317
Now, we're gonna find out who done this.

261
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:26,904
If you have any ideas who would
want to kill your brother--

262
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:30,449
If I knew who did this,
you'd have two dead bodies right now.

263
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:33,869
We got a witness.
Says she saw the whole thing.

264
00:29:34,078 --> 00:29:37,248
A white male, mid-20s,
rode a custom motorcycle.

265
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:41,043
-Wore black and orange leathers.
-Black and orange leathers?

266
00:29:41,252 --> 00:29:44,088
Hey, you know somebody
who fits that description?

267
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:47,675
Not anymore.

268
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:51,387
Let's go!

269
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:09,738
FBl. Agent McPherson,
federal gang task force.

270
00:30:10,447 --> 00:30:13,742
Sheriff Barnes.
You don't look like your typical fed.

271
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:18,581
What'd you expect? A cheap suit,
late-model Taurus, a $1 0 haircut?

272
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:21,292
How'd y'all get here so fast?

273
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,587
Get this many motorheads
in one place, all wearing colors...

274
00:30:24,795 --> 00:30:27,298
...something's bound to happen.
Pays to be close.

275
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:29,758
Oh, this is Agent Henderson.

276
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:34,013
Don't let her good looks fool you.
She's one of the best field operatives.

277
00:30:35,139 --> 00:30:37,600
Excuse me, I have to take this.

278
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,605
Yeah. Hi, baby.
I'm at a crime scene right now.

279
00:30:42,771 --> 00:30:44,982
-It's a typical homicide.
-Typical homicide?

280
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:48,027
Maybe you can explain to me
what a typical homicide is.

281
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:51,447
All right, I'll take care of it.
Y eah, I promise.

282
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:53,282
-I've got an eyewitness.
-You do?

283
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:55,701
-Yeah.
-You've practically got this solved.

284
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,662
I love you too. Jesus Christ.

285
00:30:58,871 --> 00:31:01,790
We've got the murder weapon
and she saw the whole thing.

286
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:04,418
Congratulations.

287
00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:09,131
I don't care if we have to comb
every inch of California.

288
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,762
I want that boy Ford, and I want
his head in Dojo's bowl by midnight.

289
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:18,307
-Amen?
-Amen.

290
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:21,810
Come on, boy.

291
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:47,169
Motel policy for cash customers.

292
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:48,754
Jay.

293
00:31:49,547 --> 00:31:51,090
-Got him.
-Son of a bitch.

294
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:53,843
-I tried to pop Ford six months ago.
-He's cute.

295
00:31:54,051 --> 00:31:57,179
You can visit him in prison. Map.

296
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:01,350
That's why you broke, you eat too much.

297
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:07,606
-I got it.
-That's okay.

298
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:11,944
What were you planning on paying with,
your good looks or your smile?

299
00:32:16,073 --> 00:32:18,909
I love a girl who can
take care of herself, man.

300
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:22,204
I would've come back too.

301
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:24,874
If you boys will excuse me.

302
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:30,921
It seems like I'm overdue
for some paint and bodywork myself.

303
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:35,384
So, what are you gonna do about Henry?
We got a plan, right?

304
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:40,764
Y eah, once we're in the clear, I'm gonna
tell Henry where he can pick up his shit.

305
00:32:43,184 --> 00:32:44,977
Of course...

306
00:32:46,061 --> 00:32:49,607
...I'm also gonna call that punk
McPherson and tell him.

307
00:32:49,815 --> 00:32:51,942
Arrange a get-together with the evidence.

308
00:32:52,151 --> 00:32:54,695
That way everybody gets
what they deserve, right?

309
00:32:54,904 --> 00:32:57,573
Henry gets his shit,
McPherson gets Henry...

310
00:32:57,781 --> 00:33:00,242
...and we all go to Mexico and get drunk.

311
00:33:02,536 --> 00:33:06,415
As I reported earlier, Wallace, a member
of an Inglewood motorcycle gang...

312
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:10,586
... the Reapers, was brutally murdered
last night with a motorcycle chain.

313
00:33:10,794 --> 00:33:14,256
With the help of an eyewitness,
the FBI has come up with a suspect:

314
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:17,301
Cary Ford, a white male
in his late 20s.

315
00:33:17,468 --> 00:33:20,221
Ford was last seen riding
a black custom motorcycle...

316
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:22,640
... wearing orange and black
racing leathers.

317
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:25,392
If you have any idea
as to his whereabouts...

318
00:33:25,768 --> 00:33:28,437
...please contact the local authorities.

319
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:32,650
Cary Ford is now the prime suspect
in the murder of Junior Wallace.

320
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:36,237
Call the sheriff, Hal.

321
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:38,948
Ford was just spotted at Lone Pine.

322
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:41,200
Let's drive a little.

323
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:53,712
Yeah.

324
00:33:53,921 --> 00:33:56,340
Heard on the scanner
they spotted the white boy.

325
00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:00,261
-Dawson's Creek, the white boy.
-All right, get me a map.

326
00:34:02,346 --> 00:34:04,515
We gotta make up some time.

327
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:45,222
-Y eah?
-Give me Ford.

328
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:49,268
Ford. It's for you.

329
00:34:51,562 --> 00:34:53,856
-Ford.
-Change in plans.

330
00:34:54,064 --> 00:34:55,941
Seems your buddy Junior's dead.

331
00:34:56,108 --> 00:34:57,401
Feds think you did it.

332
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:01,322
Reapers think you did it.
Hell, everybody thinks you did it.

333
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,200
You tell me where my stuff is
and it all goes away.

334
00:35:04,575 --> 00:35:06,202
I don't take orders, Henry.

335
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,454
-Never have, never will.
-What's that?

336
00:35:08,662 --> 00:35:11,415
Ever heard that what you put out
comes back tenfold?

337
00:35:11,582 --> 00:35:15,252
You spent too much time in Chink Land,
Ford. What does that mean?

338
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:18,964
It means I don't wanna be next to you
when the shit hits the fan.

339
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:20,716
And by the way, Henry...

340
00:35:20,925 --> 00:35:24,720
... "Chink Land" implies China.
I was in Thailand, it's a different country.

341
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:26,722
Hey, my phone!

342
00:35:28,098 --> 00:35:30,226
Hold it right there.

343
00:35:34,522 --> 00:35:36,732
Everybody down on the ground!

344
00:35:36,941 --> 00:35:38,901
Quit shooting!

345
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,653
You got the wrong guy.

346
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:43,364
We'll let the sheriff sort it out
when they get here.

347
00:35:43,572 --> 00:35:46,325
-Are you okay?
-I got it under control!

348
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,160
I didn't kill anybody.

349
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:50,329
Shit!

350
00:35:53,707 --> 00:35:55,417
You Earl?

351
00:35:57,294 --> 00:35:59,588
Loved your French toast.

352
00:36:01,757 --> 00:36:04,176
-Down.
-Like I said, I love a girl...

353
00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:07,304
-...who can take care of herself.
-Thanks.

354
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:10,599
You're on the news.
That guy you got in a fight with is dead.

355
00:36:10,808 --> 00:36:14,645
-Henry set me up, wants his drugs back.
-Why don't you give them back.

356
00:36:14,854 --> 00:36:18,023
-It's the only insurance I got.
-You were with me last night.

357
00:36:18,232 --> 00:36:20,109
I'm your alibi. Down, Earl!

358
00:36:20,317 --> 00:36:22,027
Tell the cops.

359
00:36:22,194 --> 00:36:25,197
Right now it ain't the cops
that I'm worried about.

360
00:36:25,364 --> 00:36:26,657
Not good.

361
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:28,576
-Reapers!
-He's right, Shane.

362
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:31,328
You think we could finish
this conversation later?

363
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,209
All right. Once we're in the clear,
you call the cops. Agreed?

364
00:36:38,252 --> 00:36:39,628
What should I do with this?

365
00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:43,591
Forget what I said about liking women
who can take care of themselves.

366
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:48,846
Sorry, it's gonna get crazy.
You'll be safer here than running with us.

367
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:51,724
-See you back in L.A.
-What am I supposed to do?

368
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:53,809
Hang out with Earl?

369
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,370
Which way?

370
00:37:14,163 --> 00:37:15,789
Which way did you say, old man?

371
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,338
-Which way?
-Shortcut!

372
00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:29,512
Let's catch them,
kill them and bury them!

373
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:36,477
They're still on us!
Shit! There's more of them!

374
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:39,188
-What are we gonna do, Ford?
-Where we going?

375
00:37:40,314 --> 00:37:41,607
I'm working on it!

376
00:38:06,131 --> 00:38:08,092
Which way did they go?

377
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:20,938
Damn! Come on!

378
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:47,548
Now can we call the cops?

379
00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:49,508
-No.
-Why not?

380
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:52,136
Because it's not just the cops,
it's McPherson.

381
00:38:52,803 --> 00:38:54,180
McPherson?

382
00:38:54,346 --> 00:38:56,140
The guy that tore up your shop.

383
00:38:56,473 --> 00:38:58,350
He already thinks I'm a drug dealer.

384
00:38:58,517 --> 00:39:02,271
Now he thinks I shot Junior.
And he has no reason to think otherwise...

385
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:05,774
-...unless I can prove it.
-Bad just turned to worse. Bent link.

386
00:39:05,983 --> 00:39:08,110
This just keeps getting
better and better.

387
00:39:09,028 --> 00:39:11,280
I got a spare in my toolkit.

388
00:39:12,865 --> 00:39:14,492
He was strangled, by the way.

389
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:16,660
-Who?
-Junior.

390
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:20,998
-He was strangled with a bike chain.
-Shit.

391
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:25,836
Henry used the chain off his own bike.

392
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:31,133
-How do you know that?
-How do you know?

393
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:33,427
Yeah, how did you know that?

394
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:35,971
Well, it's....

395
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:37,848
It's complicated.

396
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:42,895
-You turning left, or we going to Oregon?
-It's right.

397
00:39:43,062 --> 00:39:44,355
It's right? What--?

398
00:39:44,563 --> 00:39:47,733
Get the finger out of my face.
I know where I'm going.

399
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,072
Henry just screwed himself.

400
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:55,825
-See those scratches and nicks?
-Yeah.

401
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:58,369
Well, it picks them up
from the sprocket.

402
00:39:58,577 --> 00:40:01,580
Now, no two bikes
got the same chain-wear pattern...

403
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:04,458
...because no two sprockets
are the same.

404
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:08,838
So we match the chain
used to kill Junior with Henry's bike...

405
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:12,007
...and we got him.

406
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,760
Like a fingerprint.

407
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:17,638
Try not to move your lips
so much when you think.

408
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:21,809
Now we call the cops, right?

409
00:40:22,893 --> 00:40:24,687
Now we call the cops.

410
00:40:27,857 --> 00:40:30,109
-Real cute, guys.
-Get a room.

411
00:40:40,578 --> 00:40:43,581
-McPherson, it's F--
-Ford. Looks like you' re trading up.

412
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:46,458
Going from drug trafficking
to first-degree murder.

413
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:49,128
-I was set up.
-ln my business I hear that a lot.

414
00:40:49,336 --> 00:40:51,881
-Loud. Recorder's on.
-Who wants to set you up?

415
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:53,966
Henry James.

416
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:57,636
Leader of the Hellions.
Now, why would he wanna do that?

417
00:40:57,845 --> 00:41:00,514
Those drugs you were looking for
belong to Henry.

418
00:41:00,681 --> 00:41:04,476
I stashed them the night before you
raided the shop. He wants them back.

419
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:08,105
Tell me where the drugs are,
I might buy that'd give Henry motive.

420
00:41:08,314 --> 00:41:12,610
-Maybe we can work something out.
-"Maybe" don't cut it. Arrest Henry...

421
00:41:12,776 --> 00:41:16,071
-...then I'll take you to the drugs.
-Arrest him? On what grounds?

422
00:41:16,363 --> 00:41:17,656
First-degree murder.

423
00:41:18,115 --> 00:41:21,035
-What if I tie the murder weapon to Henry?
-Big "if. "

424
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:22,745
Arrest him.

425
00:41:23,037 --> 00:41:25,623
-Get his bike, I'll show you.
-Get his bike. Okay.

426
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:29,627
Anyone else you'd like me to arrest?
Ex-girlfriend, second-grade teacher--?

427
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:32,922
-Hold on, I'm making a list.
-You're not listening to me.

428
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,508
-Henry killed Junior.
-I don't know that.

429
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:37,676
Then you can't help me!

430
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:50,272
Well, that didn't fly.

431
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:53,567
Screw it. Let's haul ass down
to Mexico and don't look back.

432
00:41:53,776 --> 00:41:56,111
As much as I hate to say it,
I agree with him.

433
00:41:57,488 --> 00:42:00,783
-We're going to L.A.
-Oh, yeah. That makes sense.

434
00:42:00,991 --> 00:42:03,744
I have to get Henry's bike.
That will clear me.

435
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:07,623
They'll have checkpoints on every
dirt road between here and the coast.

436
00:42:07,832 --> 00:42:10,501
We're not exactly hard
to spot driving these.

437
00:42:10,668 --> 00:42:14,880
-You wanna ditch the bikes?
-No, I'd rather be fast than invisible.

438
00:42:16,173 --> 00:42:19,510
Come on. Wouldn't be any fun
if it was easy, right?

439
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:23,973
I live my life a quarter mile at a time.

440
00:42:24,598 --> 00:42:27,935
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

441
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:45,494
Po-po got the highways
blocked from here to L.A.

442
00:42:45,703 --> 00:42:47,163
L.A.?

443
00:42:47,371 --> 00:42:50,666
Why would he go to the one place
he know I got on lockdown?

444
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:54,170
-Let's catch him on the interstate.
-No, he's smarter than that.

445
00:42:54,378 --> 00:42:55,838
He trying to backdoor us.

446
00:42:56,463 --> 00:42:57,923
He going through the Palms.

447
00:42:58,591 --> 00:43:01,343
That's the way I'd go.
And that's the way we going.

448
00:43:08,726 --> 00:43:13,689
Henry James did pull six months
in L.A. County last year for possession.

449
00:43:14,565 --> 00:43:16,358
Maybe Ford is onto something.

450
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:21,822
Then you can 't help me!

451
00:43:23,866 --> 00:43:26,368
Call in. Check everything
from Lone Pine and L.A.

452
00:43:26,577 --> 00:43:30,206
-You think Ford's going back to L.A.?
-He's going after Henry James.

453
00:43:30,414 --> 00:43:34,001
If he's right and Henry did set him up,
that's what I'd do. Let's go!

454
00:43:34,168 --> 00:43:37,171
-You have to pay for the gas.
-Oh, right.

455
00:43:55,189 --> 00:43:56,982
Reapers!

456
00:44:06,325 --> 00:44:08,702
-We'll lose them in the Palms!
-Are you crazy?

457
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:10,371
I hate it when he does this!

458
00:44:10,538 --> 00:44:14,750
-They going into the trees!
-I could see that, fool! Stay on Ford.

459
00:44:41,777 --> 00:44:44,446
-I got his ass!
-They're shooting at us, Ford!

460
00:44:44,655 --> 00:44:45,948
-I know!
-What do we do?

461
00:44:46,157 --> 00:44:47,783
Go right! They'll follow me!

462
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:22,443
Meet the twins!

463
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,253
All right, Ford!

464
00:45:42,379 --> 00:45:44,423
Just you and me, baby!

465
00:46:11,075 --> 00:46:13,160
Shouldn't pick on girls.

466
00:49:14,049 --> 00:49:15,759
You all right?

467
00:49:20,431 --> 00:49:23,267
I just jumped my bike
onto the roof of a moving train.

468
00:49:23,434 --> 00:49:26,687
It's amazing what you can do
when you have no choice.

469
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:33,944
Where are Val and Dalton?

470
00:49:35,488 --> 00:49:38,324
He had me, dog. He had me.
I was gone!

471
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:41,452
He's the one snatched me up out of there!

472
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:44,747
I'm trying to figure out why.
He ain't acting like no killer!

473
00:49:44,955 --> 00:49:47,500
Your brother's dead
and cracker's on the run.

474
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:52,004
Shit don't feel right.
Don't sound right, don't look right.

475
00:49:52,213 --> 00:49:54,965
Only way we can find out
is to get our hands on him.

476
00:49:55,132 --> 00:49:58,302
-I'm with that.
-Then get your black ass up and let's go!

477
00:49:58,511 --> 00:50:00,137
Everybody, let's go!

478
00:50:11,649 --> 00:50:13,776
First time Val's beat you anywhere!

479
00:50:13,984 --> 00:50:16,070
Must be the chick.

480
00:50:16,278 --> 00:50:18,864
Yeah, I stopped for a manicure.

481
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:24,036
Want this hour's bad news?
Every major road in L.A. is blocked.

482
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:27,873
I know you said it wouldn't be any fun
if it was easy...

483
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,626
...but does it have to be this much fun?

484
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,177
You said you could make this
go away. How?

485
00:50:40,386 --> 00:50:44,598
Sometimes witnesses
forget what they saw.

486
00:50:44,765 --> 00:50:46,642
Refuse to testify.

487
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:48,561
You still want your shit back...

488
00:50:48,727 --> 00:50:52,064
...I'll call you when I get to L.A.
3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

489
00:50:55,442 --> 00:50:57,153
What?

490
00:51:01,448 --> 00:51:05,161
Jay, something doesn't sit with me.
Ford doesn't profile up as a killer.

491
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:08,289
Yeah? Good instincts, Henderson.

492
00:51:08,455 --> 00:51:13,002
Listen, I gave Ford a chance
to tell the truth six months ago. He ran.

493
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,880
I gave him another chance last night.
He ran again.

494
00:51:16,046 --> 00:51:20,926
Innocent men, Henderson, don't run.

495
00:51:22,928 --> 00:51:24,221
He went for it!

496
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:28,350
Now we just gotta get past the several
hundred cops between us and L.A.

497
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,312
God, I hope you have a plan this time.

498
00:51:33,939 --> 00:51:35,566
Yeah, I got a plan.

499
00:51:58,923 --> 00:52:01,050
You gonna leave without me?

500
00:52:09,975 --> 00:52:11,268
Oh, my God.

501
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:14,230
Check it out, man.

502
00:52:15,272 --> 00:52:17,066
Holy shit.

503
00:52:23,113 --> 00:52:27,159
Seen three bikers and a chick on a couple
of crotch rockets in the last hour?

504
00:52:29,578 --> 00:52:31,580
Must be something in the water up here.

505
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:35,668
Okay. Words strung together
into sentences obviously bewilder you.

506
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:37,753
Let me try again.

507
00:52:38,546 --> 00:52:40,422
Three dudes...

508
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:43,008
...a girl...

509
00:52:43,217 --> 00:52:45,094
...and a couple of bikes.

510
00:52:47,304 --> 00:52:50,766
-Don't know. Seen a lot of truckers.
-Really?

511
00:52:51,183 --> 00:52:52,893
One girl.

512
00:52:53,269 --> 00:52:56,188
-Man, you should've seen the pair--
-Shut up.

513
00:52:58,983 --> 00:53:00,276
Does this thing work?

514
00:53:09,076 --> 00:53:11,996
Ford. What is wrong with you?

515
00:53:12,163 --> 00:53:13,873
Sorry.

516
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:16,125
-ls it fried?
-Yeah.

517
00:53:27,344 --> 00:53:31,307
So you never actually told me
why you chose Thailand.

518
00:53:33,434 --> 00:53:37,646
Well, I just wanted to go someplace
that wouldn't remind me of you.

519
00:53:38,522 --> 00:53:40,065
Oh, yeah?

520
00:53:40,274 --> 00:53:42,776
How did that work out for you?

521
00:53:44,904 --> 00:53:47,740
-Not real well.
-No?

522
00:53:49,074 --> 00:53:51,285
Oh, come on, admit it.

523
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:54,163
You're so glad I came back.

524
00:53:55,206 --> 00:53:59,001
I just had nothing better to do
this weekend.

525
00:54:02,713 --> 00:54:05,257
Why we stopping
in the middle of the interstate?

526
00:54:06,133 --> 00:54:07,426
Roadblock.

527
00:54:07,885 --> 00:54:11,180
Sir! You're clear. Go ahead.
Move it out.

528
00:54:12,097 --> 00:54:13,891
Go ahead and send the next one!

529
00:54:15,226 --> 00:54:17,520
Check the second one back!

530
00:54:17,728 --> 00:54:21,565
-Good evening, officer.
-Could you step out of the vehicle, please.

531
00:54:21,774 --> 00:54:25,528
-There a problem?
-No, sir. Just a routine check.

532
00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:30,866
-You mind opening her up?
-No, not at all.

533
00:54:38,707 --> 00:54:41,794
-Where you coming from?
-Barstow.

534
00:54:42,002 --> 00:54:45,881
-Much drier in Barstow.
-Yeah, just a little.

535
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,808
Hey, Ed!
What are you doing back so soon?

536
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,394
I got a race in L.A. tomorrow night.

537
00:54:58,936 --> 00:55:02,731
He's all right.
Regular hero here on the local circuit.

538
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,359
-Let him through.
-Yes, sir.

539
00:55:05,734 --> 00:55:08,404
Hey, Ed, good luck tomorrow night.

540
00:55:09,613 --> 00:55:12,533
-Beat it.
-Thanks, Frank.

541
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,822
Ford should've called us by now.

542
00:55:54,742 --> 00:55:58,287
He's just having a good run.
Don't sweat it, man.

543
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,750
We got over a mil riding on this!

544
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:06,420
We're looking at life in prison if Ford
doesn't go down as planned.

545
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:08,172
Don't tell me not to sweat it.

546
00:56:12,343 --> 00:56:15,638
So grab yourself a candy bar
and shut your mouth.

547
00:56:34,698 --> 00:56:37,827
That's a sweet hog, man.
Look at that beast!

548
00:56:38,494 --> 00:56:40,830
Live to ride. Or that. Yeah.

549
00:56:42,289 --> 00:56:44,250
Could we get a picture of you guys?

550
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:48,170
We're on a road trip, we e-mail people
on our buddy list where we're at.

551
00:56:48,379 --> 00:56:49,922
Could we do that?
Who's in love?

552
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:51,423
-They are.
-Right there.

553
00:56:51,632 --> 00:56:54,051
Give me a big smile,
like you guys are human.

554
00:56:54,385 --> 00:56:57,471
He blinked and she blinked.
Look at this. Let's do it again.

555
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,849
This time, no blinking.

556
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,733
Smile.

557
00:57:14,738 --> 00:57:16,365
Now what?

558
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:29,086
It's also about financial freedom.

559
00:57:32,673 --> 00:57:35,968
-What can I do for you?
-Why don't you open up the back for me.

560
00:57:38,846 --> 00:57:40,890
That's a long truck.

561
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,355
Don't touch me.

562
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:53,611
-That's weird.
-What?

563
00:57:53,777 --> 00:57:55,404
My lock's gone.

564
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,472
You waiting for a green light?

565
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:37,571
-Let's go, make a hole!
-Truck's broke. Call a tow truck.

566
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:42,159
-Are you done?
-Get in. I'm driving.

567
00:58:44,995 --> 00:58:46,288
Fuck the police!

568
00:58:46,497 --> 00:58:48,374
-Was that a threat?
-I think it was.

569
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,869
Ford, traffic!

570
00:59:29,123 --> 00:59:31,333
This is why I hate four wheels.

571
00:59:31,876 --> 00:59:34,003
Hey, you're gonna have to
make a break!

572
00:59:34,211 --> 00:59:37,715
-We go together!
-You and Val can get Shane out of this!

573
00:59:37,923 --> 00:59:39,383
No way, I'm going with you!

574
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,395
-No, you're not.
-Goddamn it, Ford!

575
00:59:59,278 --> 01:00:01,530
I always knew you had a thing for me.

576
01:00:02,948 --> 01:00:04,408
Get her out of here!

577
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,874
Hey!

578
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:23,010
Watch out.

579
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:30,810
And I'm not gonna stand for it. I wanna
return the bike. You can take it back.

580
01:00:36,607 --> 01:00:41,070
What do you mean I can't bring it back?
Okay, there's only 200 miles on the bike.

581
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,405
If you say one more word....

582
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,831
Asshole!

583
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:54,416
Hello? Hung up again!

584
01:01:04,134 --> 01:01:06,637
-Bikers.
-This is crazy! We can call backup.

585
01:01:06,846 --> 01:01:10,641
If you don't like my driving, Henderson,
you can get out and hitch.

586
01:01:19,733 --> 01:01:21,610
No way!

587
01:01:30,703 --> 01:01:33,956
Thank God for airbags. Shut up.

588
01:02:14,747 --> 01:02:16,665
-Come on, Ford.
-You got this wrong!

589
01:02:32,598 --> 01:02:34,058
Damn!

590
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,906
Damn! Crazy white boy!

591
01:02:49,281 --> 01:02:51,492
Look, man, I don't wanna--

592
01:02:55,913 --> 01:02:58,582
You think you man enough
to drop that hammer?

593
01:02:58,749 --> 01:03:01,961
Don't want to.
I didn't kill Junior either.

594
01:03:02,169 --> 01:03:04,547
If I did, I would've
let you die at the tracks.

595
01:03:04,755 --> 01:03:10,094
-Why didn't you stick around and talk?
-I didn't think this would go all that well.

596
01:03:11,595 --> 01:03:14,181
All right.
You didn't kill him, who did?

597
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,476
Henry James. He set me up.

598
01:03:20,104 --> 01:03:22,773
So I'm supposed to just believe
what you say now?

599
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:25,985
Well, see for yourself.
I'm taking him down.

600
01:03:27,153 --> 01:03:30,406
You don't believe me,
you can always shoot me then.

601
01:03:33,117 --> 01:03:34,660
You dropped this.

602
01:03:41,876 --> 01:03:44,420
This better be someone
with good news or money.

603
01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:49,008
What would you say if I gave you Junior's
killer and Henry's drugs at the same time?

604
01:03:50,509 --> 01:03:51,969
Where?

605
01:03:52,178 --> 01:03:56,140
You know the address. You busted
its doors down about six months ago.

606
01:03:56,348 --> 01:03:58,267
Meet me there in two hours.

607
01:04:24,084 --> 01:04:25,878
Crystal meth.

608
01:04:33,344 --> 01:04:36,013
I don't suppose we got
a spare set of hands?

609
01:04:44,855 --> 01:04:47,024
-Yeah?
-Don't "yeah" me.

610
01:04:47,233 --> 01:04:49,026
How we doing over there?

611
01:04:49,193 --> 01:04:50,986
It's just me and the fishes, man.

612
01:04:51,195 --> 01:04:53,280
If a mermaid pops up, I'll call you.

613
01:04:59,286 --> 01:05:01,539
-Just stay there at Dalton's.
-Yeah.

614
01:05:01,747 --> 01:05:03,541
It's lovely here.

615
01:05:03,749 --> 01:05:05,751
I'll see you in a little while.

616
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,419
Just be careful, all right?

617
01:05:07,586 --> 01:05:10,673
-Well, you know me.
-Yeah, that's why I'm worried.

618
01:05:11,799 --> 01:05:13,676
I'll call you when it's over.

619
01:05:21,642 --> 01:05:24,728
-Who the hell is that?
-I ordered pizza.

620
01:05:26,313 --> 01:05:28,399
-You're kidding me, right?
-No.

621
01:05:29,567 --> 01:05:31,861
-You're not kidding?
-I eat when I'm nervous.

622
01:05:32,069 --> 01:05:35,156
He eats when he's horny.
He just likes to eat.

623
01:05:39,243 --> 01:05:41,036
How you doing?

624
01:05:47,918 --> 01:05:49,628
Seems like your boy ain't coming.

625
01:05:51,255 --> 01:05:52,965
Now what?

626
01:05:54,842 --> 01:05:57,136
He'll be here. Trust me.

627
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:01,891
Tell me you got a million dollars'
worth of my ice?

628
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:04,101
I'd try to be punctual.

629
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:06,770
You ain't Henry.

630
01:06:48,187 --> 01:06:49,480
He'll be here.

631
01:06:50,189 --> 01:06:53,025
You know, I ain't exactly
known for my patience.

632
01:07:01,492 --> 01:07:03,744
-What's this?
-Y2K.

633
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:07,623
Fastest bike in the world.

634
01:07:07,832 --> 01:07:12,628
Carbon-fiber chassis built around
a Rolls-Royce jet helicopter engine.

635
01:07:13,587 --> 01:07:16,340
Zero to 200 in less than 1 0 seconds, huh?

636
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:20,135
I heard of these.

637
01:07:20,886 --> 01:07:24,807
-What's wrong with this one?
-I don't own it.

638
01:07:25,015 --> 01:07:28,978
-FBl! Hands where I can see them!
-Drop it. Hands behind your head.

639
01:07:29,186 --> 01:07:31,772
-You tried to set me up.
-They're here for Henry.

640
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:34,650
Put the gun on the ground
and slide it to me, now.

641
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:39,071
You're supposed to wait for Henry.
Didn't you learn anything in FBl school?

642
01:07:39,238 --> 01:07:41,699
Ford, shut up.

643
01:07:44,702 --> 01:07:46,412
Those Henry's bikes?

644
01:07:46,579 --> 01:07:48,497
-Yeah.
-And the meth's inside them?

645
01:07:48,873 --> 01:07:51,000
-Yeah.
-Then...

646
01:07:51,709 --> 01:07:53,335
...nice work.

647
01:07:53,919 --> 01:07:57,173
Hey. Nancy Drew.

648
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:03,929
"No. Don't shoot. Stop. "

649
01:08:04,138 --> 01:08:07,683
What a sad and sudden tragedy.

650
01:08:08,726 --> 01:08:12,396
Nice shot, by the way.
Seriously. So now...

651
01:08:12,605 --> 01:08:15,357
...I get to pin this murder on you...

652
01:08:15,566 --> 01:08:19,445
...and, well, everyone knows
you killed Junior...

653
01:08:19,653 --> 01:08:22,740
...so now
I can shoot you both.

654
01:08:24,575 --> 01:08:25,951
-Shit.
-Yeah.

655
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,206
-Which one of you guys wants to go first?
-Him. Shoot him first.

656
01:08:32,082 --> 01:08:34,335
You sure the drugs are in there?

657
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,512
-Hey.
-They're wired.

658
01:08:47,014 --> 01:08:49,517
You put the gun on the ground
or we all go up.

659
01:08:53,938 --> 01:08:56,941
It's my girlfriend. Excuse me. Sorry.

660
01:08:57,149 --> 01:08:58,943
Hey, baby. I'm fine.

661
01:08:59,151 --> 01:09:01,987
Why don't you come in? All right.

662
01:09:02,822 --> 01:09:04,532
You're gonna love her.

663
01:09:19,964 --> 01:09:22,132
Meet my partner.

664
01:09:23,551 --> 01:09:27,596
Did you really think I was stupid enough
to walk into a trap?

665
01:09:28,639 --> 01:09:30,266
Wait.

666
01:09:30,641 --> 01:09:32,268
Say hello, bitch.

667
01:09:34,895 --> 01:09:36,272
Shane.

668
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:40,568
Look who it is.

669
01:09:40,734 --> 01:09:44,780
Guess the lunch line's gonna be
a little shorter at family reunions.

670
01:09:44,989 --> 01:09:46,866
Huh, dog?

671
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:50,536
I should have done your ass
when I did your bitch brother.

672
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:53,122
Yeah, you should have.

673
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:55,666
Really?

674
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:01,172
All right. It seems we
have ourselves a little dilemma.

675
01:10:01,672 --> 01:10:06,135
Give me my meth or your little girlfriend
is gonna redefine the term "airhead. "

676
01:10:06,343 --> 01:10:08,512
Now, drop that switch.

677
01:10:15,394 --> 01:10:17,021
Who knows, baby?

678
01:10:17,188 --> 01:10:21,400
After a little time with us,
she might not wanna go back to Ford.

679
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:30,326
Go ahead, take a moment.
We have plenty of time.

680
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:43,339
Requesting backup
at 1 2000 North Alameda Street.

681
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:38,060
Thanks.

682
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:48,028
No, no, no!

683
01:11:48,654 --> 01:11:50,281
Hey, wait!

684
01:12:07,464 --> 01:12:09,091
Now, ain't that ironic?

685
01:12:20,728 --> 01:12:23,814
-You okay?
-Yeah. Where's Henry?

686
01:12:24,023 --> 01:12:27,443
-I gotta get that bike.
-I gotta get that bitch.

687
01:12:27,651 --> 01:12:28,944
Damn right.

688
01:12:45,169 --> 01:12:47,296
-You Power Rangers all right?
-That hurt.

689
01:12:47,505 --> 01:12:49,131
-Hey.
-Jay!

690
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,842
Bulletproof vest, asshole.

691
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:53,677
Shit! Let's go!

692
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,847
You were always a punk.

693
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:22,540
-Going somewhere?
-You want some of this, bitch?

694
01:13:22,706 --> 01:13:24,667
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

695
01:15:05,976 --> 01:15:07,603
You messed with the wrong chick!

696
01:15:15,903 --> 01:15:18,030
Looks like you did, bitch.

697
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:22,404
Need a ride?

698
01:17:40,506 --> 01:17:43,592
-You all right?
-I'll live.

699
01:17:44,802 --> 01:17:47,555
This is Henry's sprocket.
It should match the chain--

700
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:51,308
Your friends just told me.
Could we maybe do this later?

701
01:17:55,396 --> 01:17:58,149
All these dead white folks around here.

702
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:00,943
So it look like we done, huh?

703
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:08,409
-I'm sorry about your brother.
-Yeah.

704
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:12,997
I gotta get out of here. Me and
Johnny Law ain't on a first-name basis.

705
01:18:13,164 --> 01:18:14,707
Hey.

706
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,668
-What?
-Thanks.

707
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:21,463
Don't sweat it, man.
Just do me one favor.

708
01:18:21,839 --> 01:18:25,176
-What's that?
-Keep your ass out of lnglewood.

709
01:18:39,482 --> 01:18:43,611
This shop was the only thing
in the world that was really mine.

710
01:18:44,695 --> 01:18:47,990
Do you have any idea how long
it took me to save up for it?

711
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:50,159
I'm sorry, Shane.

712
01:18:50,409 --> 01:18:53,329
You're in the clear,
so I guess you got what you wanted.

713
01:19:04,381 --> 01:19:07,593
You're looking at the only reason
that I came back.

714
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,596
I'm betting on more days like that.

715
01:19:13,224 --> 01:19:16,560
You know what you
could do for me, Ford?

716
01:19:19,563 --> 01:19:22,024
Take me to Mexico.

717
01:19:30,908 --> 01:19:33,327
-Where we heading?
-South.

718
01:19:35,079 --> 01:19:36,455
I got someone to pick up.

719
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,753
Let's ride.

720
01:19:43,305 --> 01:20:43,621
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
