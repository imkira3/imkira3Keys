What? Like, here? At the dance?

184

Well, there's always the library.

-I'm kidding.

everything, you know?

-This is the bible.
-l thought That was an urban legend.

No. This is real. This goes back decades.

Okay. So what?

279
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:52,290
This is exactly what we need
to finally get laid.

Honey, I know that I can't stop you
from doing certain things,

01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,812
but I can insist that you are safe.

943

No. John Costello drove me home.

Well, I want you to know that if
you find yourself in any carnal situation,

946
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:46,990
that you... You will use protection.

947
01:02:47,412 --> 01:02:49,488

948
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:53,199

960

I thought I had the answers.

961
01:03:32,247 --> 01:03:35,948
It's too bad that 99% of the bible's
completely unreadable.

962
01:03:37,879 --> 01:03:39,207
That's it.

963
01:03:39,924 --> 01:03:42,045
We need to reconstruct the bible.

964
01:03:42,132 --> 01:03:43,213
Why?

965
01:03:43,301 --> 01:03:44,712
The secrets are in there.

966
01:03:44,803 --> 01:03:47,719
I mean, there's no one single answer
to getting laid.

967
01:03:47,804 --> 01:03:49,762
Right? We need the whole book
to understand.

968
01:03:49,848 --> 01:03:51,925
Probably has a lot of crap in there
that we need to know, too,

969
01:03:52,017 --> 01:03:55,019
like positions, techniques,
angle of insertion.

970
01:03:55,104 --> 01:03:59,315
Exactly. That's what the bible was
created for, to help guys like us.

971
01:03:59,484 --> 01:04:02,603
And we owe it to the others.
I ruined the bible.

<i>I'm calling from</i>
<i>East Great Falls High School</i>

986
01:04:50,074 --> 01:04:54,119
NOAH: lt was the summer
of my junior year, 1969,

987
01:04:54,203 --> 01:04:56,955
and my buddies and I,
we take this trip to Amsterdam,

988
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,954
where we run into a group
of semi-attractive Dutch nymphos

989
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:05,254
who were willing to trade their bodies
for a handful of Jimi Hendrix LPs.

990
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:09,836
Well, needless to say, we had ourselves
one super weekend with those gals,

991
01:05:10,053 --> 01:05:12,756
sexually speaking, if you get my drift.

992
01:05:13,556 --> 01:05:16,426
But the sad news was,
we had no idea what we were doing.

993
01:05:16,517 --> 01:05:18,261
We had no technique.

994
01:05:18,645 --> 01:05:21,396
And then one day, we were out sight-seeing,

995
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,434
and we run into this Dutch hooker
in the red-light district,

996
01:05:24,525 --> 01:05:26,932
and she tells us about this book.

997
01:05:28,113 --> 01:05:33,154
It was a sex manual, evidently written
in the 19th century by some priest.

998
01:05:33,243 --> 01:05:35,614
Well, we read that thing cover to cover,

999
01:05:35,702 --> 01:05:38,158
and then when we got back
to East Great Falls,

1000
01:05:38,246 --> 01:05:40,997
I had the bright idea to write my own book

1001
01:05:41,082 --> 01:05:45,129
and add my own observations
and experiences and advice

1002
01:05:45,212 --> 01:05:49,127
and leave it in the library for some
other hapless virgin in the class below us.

1003
01:05:49,217 --> 01:05:53,295
But I had no idea it had been
passed down for 40 years.

1004
01:05:53,512 --> 01:05:56,134
Your book is a legend, Mr Levenstein.

1005
01:05:58,642 --> 01:06:00,136

This is a real piece of history here.

1012
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:19,244
What happened to it?

1013
01:06:19,412 --> 01:06:21,156
Well, that's why we're here.

1014
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:22,493
The bible kinda got ruined,

1015
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:26,532
so we wanna call everyone on the list
and try to reconstruct it.

Well, I think you boys might need
some help.

1018
01:06:35,929 --> 01:06:39,843
Well, girls have the advantage,
because girls talk to each other,

1019
01:06:39,932 --> 01:06:42,637
and don't kid yourself,
they talk about the penis.

1020
01:06:42,727 --> 01:06:46,142
Penis size, penis shape,
the angle of the bend.

1021
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:48,189
Whether it winks at you. They talk.

1022
01:06:48,274 --> 01:06:52,189
Now, to really make love to a woman,
you gotta really care about her.

1023
01:06:52,278 --> 01:06:56,227
But... Hey, sex is great, but sex with
someone you love? That's awesome.

1094
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:39,125
No. I found it in Cody's room. So strange.

1095
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:42,245
I mean, I just don't remember
leaving it there.

Yes.

But no drinking,
and if you do drink, no driving.

Don't worry. If I do anything wrong,
I'm sure it'll end up on YouTube, so...

01:11:58,306 --> 01:12:00,299

-l wanna play.
-Right.

Hi, Nathan.

1112
01:12:53,258 --> 01:12:54,918
Thanks for the flowers.

1113
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:58,459
I'm sorry about being a jerk.
And, for the record, I've learned my lesson.

1114
01:12:58,553 --> 01:13:01,506
I'm ready to respect you
and support you on your pledge.

Really? But why?

I'm in this for you.
I'm not in it just to have sex.

1117
01:13:10,227 --> 01:13:13,096
Well, I realised that I'm in this for you,

1118
01:13:13,186 --> 01:13:17,016
and if the pledge gets in the way of that,
then how good can it really be?

1119
01:13:17,106 --> 01:13:21,813
Sounds like a good basis for the two of us
to just relax and see what happens.

1120
01:13:22,193 --> 01:13:24,767
Look. I bought a book.

1121
01:13:25,612 --> 01:13:27,603
I was thinking that we could

1122
01:13:27,697 --> 01:13:31,111
start on page one
and then see how far we get this weekend.

Do you think I'm too clingy?

No. No, of course not.

is nothing happened.

01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:37,809
Why do you hook up with assholes
like Scott Stifler anyway?

1251
01:23:37,898 --> 01:23:40,188
Excuse me, but you don't know me.

1252
01:23:40,276 --> 01:23:43,443
(SCOFFS) You know,
you're just the same as all the rest.

1253
01:23:43,529 --> 01:23:44,691
I'm just some sort of trophy to you.

1254
01:23:44,781 --> 01:23:47,238
You don't care about me.
You just wanna sleep with me,

1255
01:23:47,325 --> 01:23:50,160
because you think
it's some sort of status symbol.

1256
01:23:50,244 --> 01:23:51,407
Sorry.

l'll get help.

ASHLEY: What are you doing?

1262
01:24:05,303 --> 01:24:08,054
It's not that far down,
and there's, like, 20 feet of snow.

1263
01:24:08,138 --> 01:24:10,131
What, is this supposed to impress me?

1264
01:24:10,226 --> 01:24:12,263
The thought had crossed my mind.

1265
01:24:12,353 --> 01:24:14,426
Absolutely not. First of all, it's just wrong.

1266
01:24:14,521 --> 01:24:16,809
Second of all,
you're not even supposed to touch the door.

1267
01:24:16,898 --> 01:24:21,144
And third, it's just really dangerous, okay?
So just get away from there.

1268
01:24:21,235 --> 01:24:23,690
Right. What was I thinking?

1269
01:24:27,616 --> 01:24:28,697
Whoa!

Are you okay?

1272
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:35,161
I think I hurt my leg.

Idiot.

Are you okay?

Are you crazy?

1277
01:24:58,315 --> 01:24:59,776
Are you okay?

1278
01:25:00,402 --> 01:25:03,606
Yeah, I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1279
01:25:03,697 --> 01:25:07,231
About what you said
about how I don't care about you

1280
01:25:07,325 --> 01:25:10,078
and you're just a trophy,
that's actually not true.

1281
01:25:10,161 --> 01:25:14,705
l really like you.
We went to elementary school together.

1282
01:25:15,001 --> 01:25:18,168
I remember when you sang <i>Hey Ya!</i>
in the sixth-grade talent show.

1283
01:25:18,253 --> 01:25:22,383
I remember when you fell off the pyramid
at the homecoming game, freshman year.

1284
01:25:22,466 --> 01:25:25,337
You were so embarrassed, but I didn't care.

1285
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:29,211
I just liked how you played it off
like it was all part of the routine.

1286
01:25:29,306 --> 01:25:35,892
I mean, yeah, sure, you're a super-hot babe,
but I actually like you for you.

1287
01:25:38,067 --> 01:25:40,770
Look, this may be a shock to you,

1288
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:45,108
but I have no idea what I'm doing with girls.

1289
01:25:46,659 --> 01:25:49,992
But I really wanna learn.
You just give me a chance.

1290
01:25:50,914 --> 01:25:52,786
That's all I'm asking.

1291
01:25:53,498 --> 01:25:57,496
And I guarantee that
l will make it my life's mission

1292
01:25:57,586 --> 01:26:00,921
to satisfy you in every way possible.

1293

Dude. You forgot to sign it.

1295
01:27:47,783 --> 01:27:50,358
You sure we can't just keep it
for one more year?

No, guys, it's someone else's turn.
