3
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:15,292
Hey, yeah. The 1960's?

4
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,583
Happy times, heavy times.

5
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,500
- All right, so you get your daughter, right?

6
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:35,833
Your daughter, she might be Catholic.

7
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,542
She might be Jewish. She might be anything.

8
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:41,125
So you bring her up in what they call the bourgeois,

9
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,375
American-type-society family, you know?

10
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:44,208
You bring them up

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,042
so they don't screw until they get married.

12
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,833
You take them to church on Sunday.

13
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,667
Then you teach them all you can.

14
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,583
What you think you can teach 'em

15
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,333
about how to bring up a family,

16
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,042
how you should look and act,

17
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,167
then they send 'em to college.

18
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,333
You bust your hump.

19
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,625
No government subsidy.

20
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:01,083
Nobody's paying nothing.

21
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,625
You save your money, or you borrow the money.

22
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,958
You work overtime. You send her to college.

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,917
You want her to get an education.

24
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,667
The first Easter she comes home on a vacation,

25
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,667
she says, "Hey, Dad, I'm living with some guy."

26
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:14,833
"You're living with some guy?

27
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,625
What do you mean you're living with some guy?"

28
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:19,000
"Well, this is the thing now, free love."

29
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:19,833
- We're getting away from,

30
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:20,792
we're getting away from the original point.

31
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,333
What we're trying to find is,

32
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,625
why are these bastards rioting?

33
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,458
Because they did dope.

34
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,958
Listen, you're going in the wrong direction.

35
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,792
What of it?

36
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:30,833
What happens is, look,

37
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:31,667
I'm sending you to school.

38
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,250
I'm breaking my ass and I'm sendin' you to college, right?

39
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:35,250
I expect you're going to learn something.

40
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:36,458
Not to be a janitor?

41
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,167
Learn something to justify my investment in you.

42
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,250
But some of these people revel in the fact

43
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:45,500
that their kids are leaders, are rabble-rousers.

44
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:47,083
This son of a bitch just started a riot.

45
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,042
Oh, Joe, too much.

46
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,458
These kids think they're the first generation

47
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,667
that ever screwed before they got married.

48
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,625
We all did, but we always had one girl.

49
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,208
She screwed that girl you took out.

50
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:00,875
It's better off these kids don't get married

51
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:01,708
because, if they get married,

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,750
they haven't got the guts to stick with it.

53
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,750
â™ª Hey, you fucking intellectuals â™ª

54
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:50,583
â™ª You think you're so where it's at â™ª

55
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,750
â™ª Before you fill your minds with any junk â™ª

56
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,417
â™ª Better listen to Fritz the Cat â™ª

57
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,917
â™ªAs writers and poets and artists â™ª

58
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,042
â™ª It's your duty to live life to the most â™ª

59
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,958
â™ª So butt out, brothers and check out the world â™ª

60
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,583
â™ª Give me a ride to the coast â™ª

61
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:02,542
â™ª Fritz the Cat â™ª

62
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:03,833
â™ª He fought many a good man â™ª

63
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,417
â™ª Laid many a good woman â™ª

64
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,083
â™ª Live life to the fullest â™ª

65
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,333
â™ª Cry out for more until it bleeds â™ª

66
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:13,833
â™ª Help me, help me help you, mother â™ª

67
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,542
â™ª Love me, I hate you â™ª

68
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,500
â™ª Love me, I kill you â™ª

69
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:22,042
â™ª Love me, I love you â™ª

70
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,875
- Sheesh! What a mob in the park today.

71
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,958
God, the place is crawling with phonies.

72
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,333
- Yeah, high school punks.

73
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,542
- Man, you know, those creeps

74
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,917
are always here on weekends, man.

75
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,042
Most of them are total jag offs.

76
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,542
- Oh, so many people here and nobody here.

77
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,583
- Hey, dig that chick, man!

78
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:41,417
- Oh, over there?

79
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,625
- Man, look at that ass on her!

80
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,208
- Oh, yeah. What a baby carriage.

81
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,042
- Well, so what, man?

82
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,875
- Hey, if you hadn't showed up so late,

83
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,542
Fritz, we would be all right now.

84
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:49,667
- Yeah, Fritz always does it, man.

85
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,458
- Everybody's here with their guitars already, man.

86
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,292
- Cool, right, but I got-

87
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,000
- Sixteen versions of "Lemon Tree."

88
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:57,750
I just want some place where I can sleep.

89
00:03:58,042 --> 00:03:59,292
I mean, I can cook.

90
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,708
I mean, I can sew and I can do housework

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,458
and things like that, right?

92
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,833
- Get out, get out the guitars.

93
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,375
Come on, get them out. Get them out!

94
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,208
And one, two, three.

95
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,292
â™ª Once I had a little girl â™ª

96
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,667
â™ª Who was in love with me â™ª

97
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,250
â™ª Well, well, baby â™ª

98
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:16,875
â™ª I know, I know â™ª

99
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,292
â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

100
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,875
â™ª Yeah, yeah â™ª

101
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,000
â™ª Oh, mama, mama â™ª

102
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:26,833
â™ª Singing it, ho â™ª

103
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:33,875
Dumb chicks.

104
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:36,083
- Easily impressed by spades.

105
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,375
- It's the thing, man.

106
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:49,250
- Uh, look, um, I'm gonna split. I'll see you guys later.

107
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,875
- Yeah, hang loose, Fritz.

108
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:56,042
- I've read everything James Baldwin's written.

109
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,042
He has a true sense of the problems of Black people.

110
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,208
- I worked for Head Start for free last summer.

111
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,583
Black kids are so much groovier.

112
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,917
- I went to a couple of Black Panther meetings.

113
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,583
The time for non-violent revolution is past.

114
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,083
More power to the people!

115
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,333
- I'm taking a course in African studies at school.

116
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,042
I had no idea you people were so civilized.

117
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,208
Do you know that property values actually go up

118
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
when a black family moves in?

119
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:22,333
Freud didn't write for the black man.

120
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,625
- Why does a great actor like James Earl Jones

121
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:27,042
always have to play Black men?

122
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,875
- Don't you hate it when people say "Colored"

123
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:30,958
or "Negro" and not "Black"?

124
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,292
Black is beautiful.

125
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,625
- It's so great that Black people

126
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,000
are wearing their hair natural.

127
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:36,458
Not emulating the image of beauty

128
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,250
that White people inflict upon them.

129
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,875
- I had a black girlfriend once

130
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:41,458
who said that Jewish people

131
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,125
were the closest to Black people.

132
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:44,250
I'm Jewish, you know.

133
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,292
- I ain't no jive-ass Black nigger, honey.

134
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,667
Who do you think I am, Geraldine?

135
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,375
- Oh! Oh, God!

136
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,250
Oh! Oh, Jesus!

137
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,042
- How awful.

138
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,958
- My soul is tormented.

139
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,792
- Gee.

140
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:13,625
- Oh, no. - I've been up

141
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,250
and down the four corners of this big old world.

142
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,083
I've seen it all! I've done it all!

143
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,125
- Gee. - Oh, wow.

144
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:21,208
- I've fought many a good man

145
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,750
and I've laid many a good woman.

146
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,250
I've had riches and fame and adventure.

147
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:30,083
I've stood face to face with danger

148
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,750
and death countless times.

149
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:32,583
- Hey! - Why, why-

150
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,292
- Are you somebody famous?

151
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:37,250
I think I saw you in a movie once.

152
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,000
- Hey, try not to interrupt, huh?

153
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,458
I've tasted life to the fullest

154
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,083
and still my soul cries out.

155
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,292
Yes, cries out in this hungry,

156
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,250
tortured, wrecked quest, "More!"

157
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:48,750
- Look at the good side of life.

158
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:49,792
- Things aren't all bad.

159
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,708
- Gee, he's handsome.

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,917
- You. You can help me.

161
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,208
You must save me.

162
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,708
But, by so doing, you, too, will be saved.

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,250
- Well, I, I'd like to, but what can I do?

164
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,208
- Lovely set of eyes there.

165
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,250
Ah, little sweet one, with your heart of gold.

166
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:05,833
I know of a place where we can be alone

167
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:06,792
to join our souls

168
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:10,250
in sacred truth. - Gee, you're good lookin'.

169
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:11,500
- Hey. - Hey!

170
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,375
I want to be in on this thing.

171
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,000
- Yeah, what about my soul, you fink?

172
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,000
- Four in bed, that's a kink I haven't tried yet.

173
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:20,417
- What? - Huh?

174
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,083
Yes, together, we shall all learn

175
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,667
of the real existential essence of the life force.

176
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,208
- Yeas, "existential." I heard that word once.

177
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,208
- What's it mean?

178
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,833
- It means, like, "Cool, gear". You know, stupid?

179
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,708
- You are a true genius, Fritz.

180
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:53,500
- Wild, this is wild. - Oh, honey, I could go, too.

181
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,458
- Oh, my! - I know that.

182
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:16,167
I know you know. How do you think I knew?

183
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,500
- I'll get it. God damn it!

184
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,583
- What's happening, man?

185
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,708
- Hey, Fritz the Cat has become the stud of the year.

186
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,375
We're having a session here now, so I don't know.

187
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,625
- Hm. Say, anybody using that room?

188
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:43,667
- That's the john, I mean, if you're really strung out, man.

189
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,625
- We'll take it! We'll take it!

190
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:47,417
This way, group. Come along, now, step lively.

191
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,333
Watch your step.

192
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,458
That's a girl, rub-a-dub-a-dub.

193
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,500
Okay, a new world of experience awaits us, my loves.

194
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,292
This bathtub is now transformed

195
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,000
into a space capsule of truth and love.

196
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,250
- Wow! This is wild! - Yes, yes!

197
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,958
Only in naked closeness like this,

198
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,292
can we all know each other.

199
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,125
- Yes! Right!

200
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:08,625
Very good, Winston, darling! "Naked closeness," true.

201
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:10,500
You are a perceptive girl.

202
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,458
Closeness, we must all get very close.

203
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,667
As close as possible, as a matter of fact.

204
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,625
- Yeah! - Yes.

205
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:17,708
That's right. - It's so-

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,708
- Let's all get close together.

207
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,542
Ooh, boy, closeness and fulfillment of our hidden desires

208
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,292
through which we reach the truth.

209
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,958
Fulfillment is important. Don't you think so, Winston?

210
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,583
Ooh, yes.

211
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,417
Very important. - Yeah.

212
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,208
Oh, wow! Yeah, now I'm getting to the truth, I think, yes.

213
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,292
- Oh, yes! - Hmm.

214
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:40,333
It's all very clear now.

215
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:44,583
OK, Winston. Here come the truth.

216
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,500
You got the word.

217
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:47,417
Oh, Fritzy. - You got such

218
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,583
an existential little body.

219
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,958
Jeez, wow!

220
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,667
- Oh, shit! Maybe we better go, huh?

221
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:54,958
- No, no, no! Not at all!

222
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,917
No, I, look here. You get down over here.

223
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,458
And you down, that's right, down like that.

224
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,292
- My arm! - That's right.

225
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,792
- Right under here. Watch the foot.

226
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,542
No, right, that's right. Right under here.

227
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,250
Okay, ready, everyone? Here we go.

228
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,750
- Hey, hey, hey Ralph.

229
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,125
This is, I think this is the place we got the report on

230
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:27,125
where there's these kids upstairs doing this shit

231
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:28,708
and smoking and everything, I think.

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,875
- Tell me what to do. I never went in before.

233
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,083
Tell me what to do.

234
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,458
- Well, yeah, because you're a rookie

235
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,500
and this is your first beat.

236
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:35,917
You just follow me. You see, we walk up the steps.

237
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,458
We make no noise. Like, we don't make any noise.

238
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,375
And you follow me slowly. You got that?

239
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,167
I do, just like Dick Tracy.

240
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,917
- No, it's like "Terry and the Pirates".

241
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,250
Dick Tracy's old hat. Now, let's go inside.

242
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:51,625
- Wait. Could I get to search the girls?

243
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,333
- Yeah. I've done enough of that.

244
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,250
Here we go. And watch me, 'cause I'm a natural in action.

245
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:02,000
Up the steps.

246
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:10,792
- Hey, man.

247
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,625
What the hell's going on in here?

248
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,125
- For Christ's sake, what do you want?

249
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,500
- For Christ's sake,

250
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,625
Fritz is having his own private little orgy.

251
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:22,792
Move over, man.

252
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,750
- Will you get out of here? We're seeking after the truth!

253
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:30,708
- It's my bathtub, man.

254
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,125
Don't pay attention to that Fritz.

255
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,292
He got a Jesus complex.

256
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,292
- Oh, I know it!

257
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,000
- Have some joy puff, sweet little bird.

258
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:53,917
- Hello, hello, New York.

259
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,083
Heard you're having a hash session here.

260
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,792
- Wow, this is where it's at!

261
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,083
- Right, yeah, man, come join us.

262
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,625
Good stuff and lots of it, man.

263
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,125
Only close the door, we're modest.

264
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,125
- Har har har, the guy's a riot.

265
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,042
- Oh, God! God, I'm there!

266
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm there! - You're really there?

267
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:21,708
How is it? - It's, oh, it's-

268
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,542
- How is it?

269
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,250
- That's funny. I'm not there anymore.

270
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh, shit.

271
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:30,208
- I'm a writer. Let's talk about it.

272
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,250
- Ever made it with an aardvark before?

273
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,125
It's a rare opportunity, you know? We're scarce.

274
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,167
Really?

275
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,625
- I can't tell if I'm there or not. How do you tell?

276
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,792
- Oh, you'll know when you are.

277
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,250
- Oh, balls. It doesn't work for me.

278
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:52,167
I'm a failure as a pot smoker.

279
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:56,083
- Don't be sad. Someday you'll make it, really.

280
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,625
Shh. I think we're here.

281
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,750
- Do you hear anything, Ralph?

282
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:37,375
- It sounds like a bunch of degenerates in there.

283
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,833
- Shh, shh, now, listen, Ralph. Now, listen.

284
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,667
You got the deeper voice, you see?

285
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,750
And I want you to yell, "Open the fucking door."

286
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:46,083
Now, say the word "Fucking"

287
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,792
because that makes you sound tough.

288
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,792
When I say three, you yell, "Open..."

289
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,208
- I'm even gonna ad-lib! I'm gonna ad-lib!

290
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,917
- No ad-libbing, Ralph. No ad-libbing.

291
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,875
- Let me call them preverts. Let me call them preverts.

292
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:58,708
- What's a prevert?

293
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,875
- A prevert is a degenerate. Didn't you know that?

294
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:03,208
- A prevert's a degenerate?

295
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,042
- Didn't you have no bringing up?

296
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,167
- I got bar-mitzvahed.

297
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,625
- You ain't supposed to laugh, Ralph!

298
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,167
This is a serious job and we're getting paid for it.

299
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,208
Cut the fucking shit out. Let's go!

300
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:23,125
- All right. Open up in there!

301
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:26,000
It's the law, hippie bastards! - Good job!

302
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:26,958
Good, Ralph, do it again.

303
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,250
- Op, okay!

304
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:30,083
- What the fuck's your problem?

305
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,000
- Cut it out! - I won't laugh!

306
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:34,375
I won't laugh! Open the door, you preverts!

307
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,708
- Open up! Law and order's here!

308
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,458
- Open up! -All right in there!

309
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,500
All right in there!

310
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,958
- Okay, open up! Here we are!

311
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,417
Oh, wow! I can do it!

312
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:05,208
- Oh, baby, do I feel high! I'm flying!

313
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:17,125
What a wonderful, wiggly world!

314
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,750
We're outside, but we'll get in!

315
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,000
Law and order's here!

316
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:23,958
- Open up! -All right in there!

317
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,917
Your fucking bath party's over!

318
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,375
- Over here! - Okay, guys!

319
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,625
- Right in the mouth! Yeah, I love it!

320
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:41,958
Take that, take it! Hey, you!

321
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,667
Get your hands out of my thing!

322
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,042
- Here we are! - Where the fuck are you?

323
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,875
Over there, in the head!

324
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,000
Get your hands off of my dick!

325
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:51,625
In the head! Ooh, I love it!

326
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,375
I love it! Ralph, where are you?

327
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,167
Ralph, help! Gotcha!

328
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,333
Now I gotcha! Here, take that!

329
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,417
Gotcha! In the heart and the head!

330
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,250
Over there! Watch that thing!

331
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:07,708
Hey! Where's the cat?

332
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:12,542
Wow.

333
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,708
- Hey, look at this big fucking gun.

334
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,958
I killed the john! I killed the john!

335
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,667
- Oh, wow! - Kill, destroy!

336
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:00,458
Can you give him your glasses because I can't?

337
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,958
I have to look.

338
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,125
- You can't see?

339
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:04,625
- I'll give them back.

340
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:09,250
A little bit, oh, boy, this is good for me.

341
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,042
Can you dig it in your eyes? You're younger than me.

342
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,917
You're forty-five, forty-eight, whatever you are.

343
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,542
I'm sixty-seven.

344
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,917
- I wish I knew. I would give you glasses.

345
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,750
I'd take another pair from the house.

346
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,792
- No, I didn't think I would need the glasses.

347
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,458
I'm not so young no more, got to remember.

348
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,333
- You don't see nothing?

349
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,250
- I'm older than you are. I'll see.

350
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,750
I'll mention that I see.

351
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,500
- You're doing fine. You're doing fine.

352
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,333
You know something that you don't have

353
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,292
to look at the book, right?

354
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,333
So, say it. Say it.

355
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,458
All right.

356
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,250
Remember.

357
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,208
- That's good. - All right, good.

358
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,833
- Good. - Beautiful!

359
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,167
- Thank you, thank you. - Just normal.

360
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,583
You know, nice and quiet.

361
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,125
No, wait a minute. Don't rush.

362
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,625
- Mother of God, I'm a fucking fugitive.

363
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:55,750
- This is the place! I saw him come in here!

364
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,542
- Oh, my God, it's a synagogue.

365
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,917
- What kind of a place is this? What is it, a church?

366
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,583
- Hey, listen, I can hear them.

367
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:04,833
That don't sound like English.

368
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,333
What are they, Puerto Ricans?

369
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,083
- Ralph, you're trying my patience, Ralph.

370
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,958
- You go down that aisle, I'll go down this aisle.

371
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,208
- Good, it's about time you said something bright.

372
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,000
And Ralph, please be quiet. It's my people.

373
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,583
- Excuse me, Rabbi. - They all got long hair.

374
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,708
- Sorry, Rabbi. - They all got long clothes.

375
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,333
- Excuse me. - Must be a hippie church.

376
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,375
- Hi, Rabbi. - Did you see him?

377
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:54,708
- God!

378
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,042
Ralph, would you please shut up?

379
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,292
- I ain't talking loud.

380
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,917
- Excuse me, Rabbi.

381
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,667
Hi, Ma. Excuse me, Rabbi.

382
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,583
Uncle Ben, how are you? I'm catching a criminal.

383
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,208
Excuse me, Rabb, it's you. Did you find him?

384
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:19,333
No, he was over there, but,

385
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,083
But I was just telling you.

386
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,250
- Cut it out!

387
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:27,000
- But I was just, I ain't talking loud!

388
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,000
- What are you doing? Oh, what's going on here?

389
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,833
You saved my life!

390
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,208
We interrupt the Israeli-Arab war

391
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,042
for this special announcement.

392
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:02,958
The president, after conferring

393
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,125
with the Israeli prime minister Golda Meir has agreed

394
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:08,708
to send more arms and equipment to Israel

395
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,417
based on the return of New York City

396
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,583
and Los Angeles to the United States.

397
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,042
- Mazel tov! Mazel tov!

398
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,042
- Stop, you motherfucking cat!

399
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,750
- Stop in the name of the law!

400
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:47,417
- Stupid, Ralph, you're not supposed to dance.

401
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,167
- But I didn't want to break the circle!

402
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,917
- You're not supposed to dance.

403
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,417
- I got musical feet.

404
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,083
- You dumb rookie. Dumb rookie!

405
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,667
You dumb rookie, dumb rookie!

406
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:02,917
You're not supposed to dance, Ralph

407
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,292
'cause you're not Jewish!

408
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:38,875
- I had a great thing going till

409
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,333
the frigging fuzz showed up.

410
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:43,333
I wish that skinny broad didn't turn on the shower, too.

411
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,375
I think I'm getting a cold. Hello, men.

412
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,792
Everybody all busy studying for their goddamn exams and all?

413
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,417
Hey, Buzz, how'd it go with that Dee-Dee chick, huh?

414
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,875
She's got some bod, huh? You have to admit.

415
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,667
Oh, Charlene isn't bad, either, though, right?

416
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:01,333
Like, wow! Hines!

417
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,208
You swine, old buddy pig!

418
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,333
You groove behind Alvina, get some kicks tonight, huh?

419
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,333
Bastards, you'd think the goddamn exams was the be-all

420
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,917
and end-all of existence, cosmic life force or something.

421
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,833
You'd think they were the frigging fugitives.

422
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,583
Can't even get in a few decent words to a guy.

423
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:27,583
Bastards! What a bore, they just sit there and take bennies.

424
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,417
And stay up all night with their face stuck

425
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,375
in a bunch of books and their thumb up their ass.

426
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,708
Oh, yes, yes, I remember the time

427
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,417
when it was all very inspiring and enlightening,

428
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,917
all this history and literature and sociology shit.

429
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,375
You think learning is a really big thing

430
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,500
and you become this big fucking intellectual

431
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,625
and sit around trying to out-intellectual

432
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:50,167
all the other big fucking intellectuals.

433
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,625
You spend years and years with your nose buried

434
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:57,417
in these goddamn tomes while the world is passing you by.

435
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,917
All the stuff to see and all the kicks

436
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,000
and all the girls are out there.

437
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:07,542
And me, a writer!

438
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,833
And a poet who should be having adventures

439
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,750
and experiencing all the diversities

440
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:14,208
and paradoxes and ironies of life

441
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,875
and passing over all the roads of the world!

442
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:20,875
And digging all the cities and towns and rivers

443
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:27,292
and the oceans and making all of them chicks.

444
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:31,583
Oh, God.

445
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,958
As a writer and a poet, it is my duty to get out there

446
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,333
and dig the world, to swim in the whole frigging scene

447
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,333
while there is still time, man.

448
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,500
My farting around days are over, baby.

449
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,833
From this day on, I shall live every day

450
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,542
as if it was my last.

451
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:49,125
Yeah, yeah! I must do it!

452
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:52,000
No more of the dreary, boring classes,

453
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:54,750
the dismal lectures, the sitting around bullshitting

454
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:56,708
with pretentious fat-ass hippies.

455
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,833
No more of the books,

456
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:00,083
the spoutings of a bunch of old farts

457
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,583
who think they know the whole goddamn score.

458
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,292
Oh, my God, what have I done?

459
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:17,833
I set all my notes and books and stuff on fire

460
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,917
and now I can't study for my exams.

461
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:25,000
I'll flunk out and my folks will be pissed off as hell.

462
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,375
I'll get a blanket.

463
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:32,958
The blanket's on fire.

464
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,792
We better call the fire department.

465
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:50,208
â™ª Gonna buy his baby a diamond ring â™ª

466
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,750
â™ª If that diamond ring don't shine â™ª

467
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:59,208
â™ª He gonna take it to a private eye â™ª

468
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,667
â™ª If that private eye can't see â™ª

469
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:08,333
â™ª He better not take that ring from me â™ª

470
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:28,417
â™ª Bo Diddley caught him a nanny goat â™ª

471
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:33,125
â™ª To make his pretty baby a Sunday coat â™ª

472
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:37,417
â™ª Bo Diddley caught him a bear cat â™ª

473
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:42,125
â™ª To make his pretty baby a Sunday hat â™ª

474
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:26,417
â™ª Maybe someday you will fall in love â™ª

475
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:31,333
â™ªAs I fell in love with you, baby â™ª

476
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:36,417
â™ª The one you love just keep falling in love with you â™ª

477
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:40,792
â™ª Then when you all alone â™ª

478
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,792
â™ª You know it'd be best, baby â™ª

479
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:44,792
- You can sing like that.

480
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:48,125
â™ª Little coquette, I love you â™ª

481
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,833
- Sing, 'cause I want to. If I get tired, I quit.

482
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,083
- But you don't want to sing.

483
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,833
I want to sing, man. I'm good.

484
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:56,792
- You sing as good as you want,

485
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,542
but you don't- - If I get tired, I quit.

486
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,042
- I went to school in Oakland

487
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,917
and I had quite a few White-type of school kids with me.

488
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,208
I'm forty-nine.

489
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:13,000
At that time, I had White kids going to school with me.

490
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:16,708
I would have peanut butter.

491
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,958
I got some peanut butter I don't want it,

492
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,042
but I ate so much when my mother gave it to me.

493
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,708
With apple butter, I got two cans of it now

494
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:31,708
that I don't eat because Whitey was eating ham sandwiches

495
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,042
and I was eating peanut butter sandwiches.

496
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:38,208
Sandwiches!

497
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,542
- I got to get out of this town for some Southern times.

498
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,125
Let me out of here. That's right.

499
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:47,250
Suck! The bus only cost $17 to New York.

500
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:50,458
I say, "I ain't made $17 in two weeks."

501
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,708
Got air to live.

502
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:06,542
- Riding a ship coming out of Pearl Harbor.

503
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And all my White friends,

504
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,958
Then we drank water out of the ditches.

505
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,458
If I had a K-ration, I gave them some of it.

506
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:25,625
And I would ride this bus.

507
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:26,625
I couldn't sit with my friend

508
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:28,667
on this bus at Houston, Texas.

509
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,792
I had to ride at the back end of this bus.

510
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,333
- I'm about to get hot now.

511
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:33,458
As a matter of fact,

512
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,667
you couldn't even go no place down South riding a bus.

513
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,167
Couldn't even get a soda,

514
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,333
walk in there and get you a sandwich.

515
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,167
- I don't give a damn about who's racist.

516
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,958
I just want equality. I want to be equal with the next guy,

517
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:57,958
because I'm paying my taxes.

518
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,083
Well, that's a different thing.

519
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:01,917
I'm a working man and I'm paying my taxes.

520
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:04,708
The money is what's happening. See what I mean?

521
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,458
- No, I'm talkin' about- - When it all counts,

522
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,792
that is what's happening.

523
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,292
I'm talking about about as far as,

524
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,708
if you want to be revolutionary, you get some bread first,

525
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,292
and then you can talk trash.

526
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:17,000
- Whitey blind us with religion.

527
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:21,708
- Yeah, if you fight violence with violence,

528
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,542
like the late Malcolm did, man, you gonna get some results.

529
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:26,500
- Right. - Really.

530
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,375
Because before this rioting and shit,

531
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,792
you didn't have no Head Start programs for kids.

532
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,625
You didn't have shit!

533
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:35,125
Really, you didn't have a goddamn thing.

534
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,292
Got you down in Harlem selling horse meat.

535
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,000
You know, if one of them motherfuckers down

536
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:42,458
and out selling horse meat, they dead.

537
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,500
- Another civil war.

538
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,125
- Civil war? - And I'm gonna

539
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:48,875
be standing back.

540
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:53,292
"Get 'em, baby!"

541
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,250
- Hey, man, you in a bag?

542
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:04,500
- Yeah, that's it. I'm in a bag.

543
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,500
- Well, just don't lose your coolness, cat.

544
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,708
I mean, don't lose your coolness.

545
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,917
- Easy for you to talk. You're a crow.

546
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:20,333
I wish I was a crow.

547
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,500
If I was a crow, I'd fly away, man.

548
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:25,958
I'd fly away from this miserable town for good.

549
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:37,458
- You think being a crow is a big motherfucking ball?

550
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,667
All you cats the same, man.

551
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:42,708
You don't know where it is.

552
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,583
There's nobody to tell you where it's at.

553
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,167
And you come up here, try to find out where it's at,

554
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:48,917
but you got to be up here, man,

555
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,833
to find out what's happening.

556
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,167
- Look, I know it isn't a ball, man.

557
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,750
I studied the race problems. I know.

558
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:58,000
- You don't know nothing about the race problem.

559
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,375
You got to be a crow to know about the race problem.

560
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,542
You know what I mean? Do you dig where I'm at?

561
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,833
You know what I'm talking about?

562
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:06,042
- Well, listen, man,

563
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,542
this thing affects me very deeply, fella.

564
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:11,542
As a cat, I have a considerable guilt complex

565
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,750
because my kind have always brought suffering on your kind.

566
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,000
- Yeah? - Yeah.

567
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,125
Yes, indeed.

568
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:38,875
See, my soul is tortured

569
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:42,167
and tormented by this racial crisis.

570
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:43,917
- No shit?

571
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,167
- I kid you not, man.

572
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,333
Sometimes I really get hung up about it.

573
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:50,167
You know, uptight, strung out.

574
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,083
- In a bag? - Yeah, in a bag!

575
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,583
- I'm gonna buy you a drink, cat.

576
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,792
Just 'cause I think you got coolness.

577
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:24,667
- Oh, great! Hey, boy!

578
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,375
Hey, boy, can I have a drink?

579
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:31,333
- Oh, man!

580
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,500
- Hey, Duke! Hey, Duke!

581
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Hey, Duke! They blowing pot like mad up in Mildred's pad!

582
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:29,542
- I'm on my way, man.

583
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:32,917
Hey, cat, how would you like to bug out now?

584
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:35,375
- By God, man! I'm gonna bug out!

585
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:36,917
- Did he say bug out, baby?

586
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,458
- Go ahead, baby, bug out.

587
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,625
- Ain't no bug out. - What kind of shit is that?

588
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:45,208
- It's a bug out to him. - It's some kind of dance.

589
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:51,208
Hey, listen, man.

590
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,333
Anybody looking our way?

591
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:25,625
- No. - Some stud gone

592
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:27,083
and left his keys.

593
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:34,458
- Hey, what are you doing? You stealing that car?

594
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:40,583
Hey, shove over, Jack! Let me drive this goddamn thing.

595
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:47,542
- Move it out!

596
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,333
Hey, man, you cats can't drive.

597
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,417
You don't know nothing about nothing.

598
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:11,750
Can't you see that car go by?

599
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:12,583
- Cool it, will you? I know how to drive.

600
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:14,667
I drive like a crow, man, really.

601
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:16,583
Man, look, slow down!

602
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:17,958
- I see it. I see the light.

603
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,458
- Man, you'll get killed up here!

604
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:44,667
- Bullshit, Ralph! Would you please shut up?

605
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,417
It's bad enough we got transferred up here

606
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,417
without you bullshitting all night.

607
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,917
Now, I gotta cover my beat

608
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,292
and I'll meet you back here in an hour.

609
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:58,583
One hour, Ralph. And, Ralph, please, be careful.

610
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:00,917
- Yeah, but Harlem?

611
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,625
- Come on, slow the car down! Look out, man!

612
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:04,958
I ain't ready to die yet!

613
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:08,458
Harlem?

614
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,125
- I know what I'm doing.

615
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:12,542
- You know, the only faces you can see

616
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,708
in a crowd up here is ours.

617
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:20,292
The way they look, all you can see is their eyes.

618
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,167
I don't like it here.

619
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,792
- I see the fuzz. I see the fucking fuzz.

620
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,667
- Cool it, just cool it.

621
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:37,333
- Right through the head I'm gonna get you!

622
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:54,917
- Throw that pig out! - Look at it!

623
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:10,125
Look out!

624
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:12,958
- Cool it, man, will you? I know what I'm doing.

625
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,542
- Like hell you do.

626
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:40,458
- Duke, you saved my life, man!

627
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,375
- Shit!

628
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:50,458
â™ª Yesterdays â™ª

629
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:56,375
â™ª Yesterdays â™ª

630
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:03,375
â™ª Days I knew as happy sweet â™ª

631
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:09,250
â™ª Sequestered days â™ª

632
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:15,458
â™ª Olden days â™ª

633
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:21,958
â™ª Golden days â™ª

634
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:27,125
â™ª Days of mad romance and love â™ª

635
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:39,167
â™ª Then gay youth was mine â™ª

636
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:46,792
â™ªAnd truth was mine â™ª

637
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:53,250
â™ª Joyous, free, and flaming life â™ª

638
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:59,333
â™ª Them sure was mine â™ª

639
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:05,583
â™ª Sad am I â™ª

640
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:11,708
â™ª Glad am I â™ª

641
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,250
â™ª For today â™ª

642
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:21,333
â™ª I'm dreaming of â™ª

643
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,792
â™ª Yesterdays â™ª

644
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:32,875
- That you, Sonny?

645
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,625
- Yeah, it's me, baby.

646
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:37,667
- How's the crowd tonight?

647
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:40,875
- Not bad. We're pushing enough grass to make our money.

648
00:40:43,042 --> 00:40:45,750
- Just enough, but it sure ain't like

649
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:48,833
the good old days in Harlem when White money was boss

650
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:51,083
and them fine, White cats came up to Harlem,

651
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,750
spreading it all around Big Bertha.

652
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,250
Oh, child.

653
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:01,125
That was before all those peace marches,

654
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,208
sit-ins, riots, and 'dos.

655
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,125
- Ain't nothing wrong

656
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:08,875
with no peace marches.

657
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:09,917
- It's me, baby.

658
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:17,458
- Who's that joker?

659
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,375
- Friend of mine.

660
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:38,333
Cat, you ever been high on pot?

661
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,542
- Are you kidding me, man, grass?

662
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,542
Who doesn't, you know?

663
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:46,458
What do you think, I'm some kind of a hick?

664
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:16,250
- Hey! Let's get that cat going on pot!

665
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:22,333
Take one. That's what I'm talking about, baby.

666
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:25,667
Nothing wrong, take two. Come on, be a club member.

667
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:28,333
That's it! Take three!

668
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:30,667
Take four! Come on, five, six, seven!

669
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:31,875
That's it, baby!

670
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,542
He ain't losing now, no, indeed.

671
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:23,583
A joint, Hilly, a joint! Stay loose!

672
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,917
Fritz, come on, now, stop! Yo, Fritz!

673
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:56,375
Fritz, come on, now, stop it!

674
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,167
No, don't stop! Oh, yeah!

675
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:05,250
Oh, no, Fritz! Come on!

676
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:11,167
Hey, toro! Hully gully cat!

677
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:19,750
Climb, sugar!

678
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:52,833
Really? Yeah!

679
00:44:58,542 --> 00:44:59,167
Oh, yeah! No, Fritz!

680
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:00,833
Come on, Fritz! Ooh, Fritz!

681
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,083
Aw, man, yeah!

682
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:16,000
Ooh, will you look at that?

683
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:20,917
Fritz, you ain't Black enough, hon.

684
00:45:37,042 --> 00:45:37,792
Oh, Fritz!

685
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:20,083
That old black magic got me!

686
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,333
- Oh, Fritz! That's right!

687
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:24,208
Right there, honey! Wow, wow, wow!

688
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,292
Pump that thing!

689
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:33,167
- Suddenly it's all very clear!

690
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,708
I must tell the people about the revolution!

691
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,375
- Huh? - Revolt, revolt!

692
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:40,792
- Damn you! What the hell you jabbering about now?

693
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:49,042
- Revolt!

694
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:54,125
Revolt! Revolt!

695
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:57,292
Revolt, you thick-skulked idiots!

696
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:59,667
You have carried heavy burdens for the bosses!

697
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:02,667
You have sweat your lives away for the bosses!

698
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:05,292
The bosses, they ride around in limousines!

699
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:06,583
- Get the fuck off my car!

700
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:09,833
- The bosses, they're eating strawberries and cream!

701
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:13,833
That's funny! Cats are real boss!

702
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:20,875
- All right, what's going on here? Break it up!

703
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,625
- Cool it, officer. He's just blowing hot air.

704
00:47:24,917 --> 00:47:26,375
No one's paying no mind.

705
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:27,708
Come the revolution,

706
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
there gonna be no more limousines!

707
00:47:30,292 --> 00:47:31,458
Come the revolution,

708
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,750
there gonna be no more strawberries and cream, see!

709
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,625
- Hey, Ralph, you know how these dumb kids are.

710
00:47:40,917 --> 00:47:42,667
They don't know what they doing.

711
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:45,542
- Yeah, fucking A right.

712
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:48,917
- There he is! He's the one who keeps the bosses in power!

713
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:51,750
He's the one who's holding you down!

714
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:52,750
- Who, me? - You!

715
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:54,208
- No, no. Not me, you.

716
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,708
- No, you! - You.

717
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,958
- You, you, you. - Me?

718
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,167
- Not me! - Yeah, you.

719
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,292
- You! - Fuck you!

720
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:00,583
- You first!

721
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:03,250
- The spiked boot of capitalism!

722
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:06,667
The iron thumb on the heads of the proletariat!

723
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:13,917
- They're gonna kill us.

724
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:38,042
- Let's just tell 'em where it is.

725
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:47,250
- Would you like to see a picture of my kids?

726
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:09,542
- Come on, man! You'll get killed up here!

727
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:49,292
- Get them, get them! - Kill them!

728
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:02,417
- Move over, nigga! - Motherfucker!

729
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:09,042
No, no, now-

730
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:37,000
- We shall overcome!

731
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:51,125
- Group Commander to Formation B.

732
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:52,875
Don't give them a chance to scatter.

733
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:54,417
Attack all congested areas.

734
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:07,792
- I've got to find him. Where could he be?

735
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,833
This is the alley behind that place he was standing at.

736
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:15,750
It gives me the creeps.

737
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:17,500
- Psst. - Fritz, Fritz!

738
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,667
- Good evening, madam.

739
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:21,417
Eek!

740
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:24,208
Oh, Fritz! Thank God I found you!

741
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:27,708
Come on! Join me, Winston, my love.

742
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,250
It's not very pretty looking, but it's cozy as a bitch.

743
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,542
- Fritz, come out of there, will you please?

744
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:34,375
- The hell you say?

745
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:37,167
With the fuzz combing the whole city looking for me?

746
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,292
Hey, has my picture appeared on TV yet?

747
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,000
Have they broadcast an alarm?

748
00:53:41,292 --> 00:53:42,458
Have they offered a reward

749
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,125
for any information leading to my arrest?

750
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:46,375
- Oh, don't be so melodramatic.

751
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:48,875
You and your illusions of grandeur.

752
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:51,833
I'm not getting in that filthy, grimy garbage can with you.

753
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:53,250
- Okay, go fuck yourself.

754
00:53:53,542 --> 00:53:55,625
- Oh, you're such a child.

755
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:59,292
Such a self-centered, egotistical child.

756
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,708
Oh, this is disgusting.

757
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,542
Look, if you're gonna talk

758
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:04,792
about my garbage can that way,

759
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:06,250
you can just get the hell out.

760
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:08,083
Listen, Fritz, are you still going

761
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,292
to bug out or not?

762
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:10,750
Are you kidding, toots?

763
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:12,750
I got no choice at this point.

764
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,250
Listen to me, will you?

765
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,958
I've got a car and some money.

766
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,417
I can get all the things we need

767
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:19,542
and we can leave right away.

768
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,708
We can go out to the coast.

769
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,208
I'll get a good job as a private secretary

770
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,458
and you can work on your poetry and all.

771
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:26,875
- Oh, okay. - Then,

772
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:29,667
we can get married and rent a nice little pad in Frisco

773
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,292
and dig the scene out there.

774
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:32,167
It's supposed to be a great town.

775
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:33,917
Frisco, yeah. Hey, okay.

776
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:38,542
â™ª She makes men into boys â™ª

777
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,417
â™ª She makes giants into men â™ª

778
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:41,875
â™ª She'll have you feeling guilty â™ª

779
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:43,417
â™ª Before you can count to ten â™ª

780
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:44,667
â™ª Poor Winston â™ª

781
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,667
â™ª Sharp mind and a body to match â™ª

782
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:47,750
â™ª Poor Winston â™ª

783
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:50,667
â™ª Fine fancy karma able, too, at that â™ª

784
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,500
â™ª Who is the girl in the fiberglass shorts â™ª

785
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:55,917
â™ª Well, it's got to be Winston Schwartz â™ª

786
00:55:03,792 --> 00:55:04,917
â™ª You can't outtalk her â™ª

787
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:06,833
â™ª 'Cause she talks too fast â™ª

788
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:08,125
â™ª You can't out think her â™ª

789
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:09,708
â™ª She's a New York flash â™ª

790
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,250
â™ª She makes love to you â™ª

791
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:12,958
â™ªAnd tell you you're in love â™ª

792
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,500
â™ª You make love to her â™ª

793
00:55:14,792 --> 00:55:16,417
â™ª She says you don't know how to do it â™ª

794
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:19,750
â™ª Poor Winston â™ª

795
00:55:20,042 --> 00:55:21,083
- Ah, Winston, my love.

796
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:24,333
At last we're zooming down that old lonesome highway.

797
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:25,583
Oh, it's wild!

798
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:28,958
- Yeah, marvelous.

799
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,625
- Marvelous, my ass! It's exalting, elating.

800
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:35,333
The cool night wind blowing past the window. Oh, man!

801
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,667
- I'm hungry. Let's stop some place.

802
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:39,708
- The hell with stopping.

803
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,667
I just want to feel those miles flying by.

804
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:44,583
I'm hungry!

805
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:54,083
- Hey, let's dig one of those little greasy truck stops.

806
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:56,792
I'd like to talk with those truck drivers, you know?

807
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:59,417
Hear what they got to say about life on the road.

808
00:56:16,917 --> 00:56:20,000
Yeah, I bet they got wild stories of the road.

809
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:25,083
You know, drivers, trucks, hijackers, fights!

810
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:26,792
Yeah, yeah, let's do it!

811
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:27,958
- Here's a good place.

812
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,458
I'll have your deluxe steak

813
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,292
with salad and coffee, black.

814
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:38,292
- All right. What would you like, sir?

815
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:44,500
- Oh, that was really a fine steak.

816
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:48,083
You can always depend upon Howard Johnson's.

817
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:51,125
Let's get back on the road, huh?

818
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:03,625
- Oh, goddamn. Fritz, Fritz, wake up!

819
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:04,958
- Huh? What?

820
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,583
- Fritz, the car is broken down

821
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:08,417
and I can't get the damned thing-

822
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:10,542
- What? Where are we?

823
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:11,625
Oh, fuck a duck.

824
00:59:11,917 --> 00:59:14,417
We're out in the middle of the frigging desert.

825
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:16,208
Jesus, it's great!

826
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,417
- Exactly. You've been sound asleep for two days.

827
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:20,417
- What?

828
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:21,458
- Two days.

829
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,125
You really must've been dragged out after your big binge.

830
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:26,500
- Shit. I guess I was.

831
00:59:26,792 --> 00:59:29,542
All that drinking and blowing pot and screwing, man.

832
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:33,542
Hey, man, I get horny just thinking about it. Like, wow!

833
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:36,667
- Start thinking about fixing this car, Fritz

834
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:38,000
or we'll be sitting here forever.

835
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:41,375
Okay, yeah. Look, is something bugging you, pal?

836
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:44,417
Yeah, the car won't go!

837
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:49,250
- Oh, okay, well, let's have a look.

838
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:53,292
Yeah, okay, I knew that all the time.

839
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:55,250
The engine's not up here. It's in the back.

840
00:59:55,542 --> 00:59:57,625
Let's just check it out.

841
00:59:57,917 --> 00:59:59,750
- What's wrong? - Let me see, I'll just.

842
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:04,167
If I move that, no. - What's wrong, Fritz?

843
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:06,917
- Well, it's all very complicated, Winston.

844
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,208
I couldn't begin to explain it.

845
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,042
I think the piston rod's stuck in the drive shaft.

846
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:13,083
Either that or the carburetor is rusted out.

847
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:14,375
- Oh, good God.

848
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:19,833
- Hey, here comes a pickup truck.

849
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:22,250
Maybe he'll give us a push to the next gas station.

850
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:27,667
- What's the trouble, buddy?

851
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:28,500
- Our car is busted down.

852
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,208
Could you give us a push to the next gas station?

853
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:34,750
- Well, let me look at it.

854
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:37,708
One thing I'm good at is fixing things.

855
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,792
Shut up! You shut up, chickens!

856
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:50,875
Shut up! When I say shut up, I mean, shut up!

857
01:00:57,833 --> 01:01:00,875
One thing I'm good at is fixing things.

858
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:06,375
Dumb chickens.

859
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:10,917
Let me see now.

860
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:13,167
Ain't nothing the matter with this car here.

861
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,625
Hey, buddy, ain't you got any sense at all?

862
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:19,000
You just gonna let your car run out of gas.

863
01:01:19,292 --> 01:01:22,000
I swear, these motherfucking hippies in New York.

864
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:26,000
There's a gas station a couple of miles back.

865
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:27,708
I'm going this way.

866
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,208
You ought to stop for gas once in a while, you stupid.

867
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,750
You gotta keep your engine fed. Wise up, buddy.

868
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:38,250
Well, how do you like that?

869
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:41,542
New York hippies come down here and they think they can,

870
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:43,125
I never, honest and true.

871
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:46,833
You think a thing like that happens.

872
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,042
- Son of a bitch.

873
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:54,167
- You're so clever, so clever, big mechanical genius.

874
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:58,458
Here's a bucket, smart guy. Good luck!

875
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,750
- Hey, this is for shit!

876
01:02:00,042 --> 01:02:01,667
You made a big bourgeois deal out of everything

877
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,250
and ruined it completely.

878
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,542
I was gonna bug out and be free

879
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:09,000
from all this bullshit and roam around

880
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:12,167
and dig everything and really have a good time.

881
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:14,667
- Your naivete is astounding.

882
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:18,125
You'd be completely lost without me, Fritz, and you know it.

883
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:19,500
- You're a motherfucking bitch.

884
01:02:19,792 --> 01:02:21,667
- I see the hard facts of life.

885
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:25,958
I am realistic, something you're incapable of.

886
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,542
You'd be better off with one of those stupid morons

887
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:30,167
like Charlene, who you could just sleep with

888
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:31,708
and throw away when you're done.

889
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,292
You can't cope with a mature woman.

890
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:36,708
You haven't the faintest idea how lucky you are

891
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,958
that an intelligent woman loves you and wants

892
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,833
to give you something of value,

893
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:44,292
something that will inflame your creative potential!

894
01:02:44,583 --> 01:02:46,458
Now, get going and hurry up!

895
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:03,708
- We'll see who gets lost without whom.

896
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:07,875
â™ª Fritz the Cat, Fritz the Cat â™ª

897
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:12,250
â™ª Fritz the Cat â™ª

898
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:14,292
â™ª Help me, help me, now you can see â™ª

899
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:37,042
â™ª When me and my chick goes rattlin' round â™ª

900
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:41,250
â™ª I'm the envy of each and every guy in town â™ª

901
01:03:41,542 --> 01:03:45,000
â™ª She looks so sharp and my girl does, too â™ª

902
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:50,083
â™ªAnd everybody knows what I'm gonna do â™ª

903
01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:54,000
â™ª Gonna take a ride on my bike â™ª

904
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:57,958
â™ª Gonna take it and ride all night â™ª

905
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:03,042
â™ª Tell my Chevy to take a hike â™ª

906
01:04:03,417 --> 01:04:06,667
â™ª Take another ride on my bike â™ª

907
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:10,333
Oh, Blue, I'm crazy about you.

908
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:28,333
- Penniless, a regular bum,

909
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:30,750
a hobo with no money and no place to go.

910
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:48,333
- Hey, you old scroungy old alley cat.

911
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:50,250
Get out of them garbage cans.

912
01:04:50,542 --> 01:04:51,292
- You talking to me, Jack?

913
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:55,208
- What the hell you doing there, anyway?

914
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,417
- Hey, man, here we are on the brink of the apocalypse,

915
01:04:57,708 --> 01:04:59,875
the eve of destruction, so to speak,

916
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:01,875
and I can't think of anything to do.

917
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:04,792
- Offhand, son, I'd say you have got a problem.

918
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:06,583
But at least you're honest.

919
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:09,375
The revolution can use a man like you. Hop on!

920
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:12,042
- Okay. Hello there.

921
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:13,125
- Hi. - How are you?

922
01:05:13,417 --> 01:05:14,625
- High. - I'll introduce you

923
01:05:14,917 --> 01:05:16,583
to the guys at the cell meeting.

924
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,375
- Blue! Glad you could make it, man.

925
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:01,000
- Howdy, John. I brought along an old buddy of mine.

926
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:03,000
He's a bright lad but bored with life.

927
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:08,958
Fritz, this here is John, former biker

928
01:06:09,583 --> 01:06:11,958
and small-time hood turned fighter for the cause.

929
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:14,833
That cat was a beautiful head.

930
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:16,458
- Glad to meet you, man.

931
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:19,208
- Another cast out for the bourgeois view.

932
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:23,333
From the mold of bankrupt sedentary.

933
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:26,000
What's the state of his political consciousness?

934
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:27,625
- Practically nil, I'm afraid.

935
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:33,917
- Our shipment of weapons just came in today: Thirty-two.

936
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:42,083
- Can I get one? - Enough to go around.

937
01:06:49,417 --> 01:06:50,375
Hey, chief.

938
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:53,417
- Getting ready for a little action planned for tonight.

939
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:57,792
- Yeah, we're gonna paralyze the whole fucking city.

940
01:06:58,083 --> 01:06:59,542
- It's going to be great, man.

941
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:02,458
- The shit is really gonna come down tonight.

942
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:03,958
- We've got everything we need

943
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,750
for three synchronized sabotage actions.

944
01:07:07,042 --> 01:07:08,667
The city will be ours.

945
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,333
- The machinery of the establishment's gonna

946
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:12,000
be in ruins by the morning.

947
01:07:12,292 --> 01:07:14,917
The government will fall without firing one goddamn shot.

948
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:17,417
- The new mayor will resign and we'll move in

949
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:19,667
and set up a tribunal.

950
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,083
- It's curtains.

951
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,083
- Blue, honey, talk to me a minute.

952
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:28,917
- Don't bother me.

953
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:30,167
- I want to talk to you, honey. Let's go.

954
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:31,250
- Leave me the hell alone.

955
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:33,667
- Oh, come on. We'll go and get some chinks.

956
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:34,750
I'm so hungry.

957
01:07:35,042 --> 01:07:36,042
- I ain't hungry.

958
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:36,917
- Don't turn off on me.

959
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:39,458
Besides- - I don't need that garbage.

960
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,292
- Every time you're with your friends

961
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:44,417
you don't pay any attention you son of a bitch!

962
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:46,083
That hurt me, god damn it!

963
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:47,958
What do you think I am, a boxing ball?

964
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:49,458
- A punching bag!

965
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:52,958
- Hit her! Hit her!

966
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:56,333
- You know what you guys are? You're a bunch of closet fags.

967
01:07:56,625 --> 01:08:00,417
Shut up!

968
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:02,667
- And when I leave this place,

969
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,917
you'll all get together and you'll screw one another.

970
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:06,833
- That's nice. Oh, that is nice.

971
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,917
Oh, she loves it. I love it, too.

972
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:14,250
- Oh, we've got a lot of lousy time to kill.

973
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:18,125
- I think I'm gonna ride that goddamn horse.

974
01:08:18,417 --> 01:08:20,542
- Then go on, have a go. You'll love it.

975
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:22,708
- Let me ride that goddamn horse.

976
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,750
- Get on with it. - You know what you are?

977
01:08:25,042 --> 01:08:27,417
You're a bunch of fucking Nazi fags!

978
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:29,958
Guys, that's uncool.

979
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,458
Don't do that.

980
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,042
Listen, you son of a bitch, you lousy-

981
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:37,833
- Hey, cut it out! You're hurting her!

982
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:41,583
You maniacs! What are you doing to her?

983
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:44,333
- Go ahead and hit me if that's how you get your rocks off!

984
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:47,792
My God, my God!

985
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:49,875
I can't take it anymore!

986
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:57,917
This isn't working out, Blue. Our relationship stinks!

987
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:23,208
Come on, Harriet. Let's go inside, huh?

988
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,792
It's cold. - Oh.

989
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:27,500
I have to go to bed by day.

990
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:30,292
Come on inside, baby. You'll get hurt out here.

991
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,083
Listen, I tried to stop them, but I-

992
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:33,542
- Come on, Fritz!

993
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:34,917
- Hey, wait a minute, huh?

994
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:39,583
John says this night will mean a great leap forward

995
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,000
for America's social evolution.

996
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:45,083
Yeah, dig it. We're gonna blow up the power plant.

997
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:49,000
This will keep you warm.

998
01:09:49,292 --> 01:09:49,917
I gotta go.

999
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,083
- Hey, baby.

1000
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,708
We all had a good time today and got our rocks off.

1001
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:12,917
Now we must devote ourselves

1002
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:15,375
to the great task that lays before us.

1003
01:10:33,667 --> 01:10:34,667
- What'd you have to hit her so hard for?

1004
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:36,042
- She loved it.

1005
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:37,333
Listen, man, me and you have been assigned

1006
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:38,333
to blow up the power plant.

1007
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,417
That's all I care about, the revolution.

1008
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:44,125
- You're full of shit!

1009
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:45,708
All you care about is a reason to hurt,

1010
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
to destroy, to blow up.

1011
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,167
You don't know what a real revolution is.

1012
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:01,958
None of you sons of bitches do.

1013
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:14,375
Harriet, well, she's good, I mean.

1014
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:18,417
She's real. She loves.

1015
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:23,042
She loves and when you get right down to it,

1016
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,167
I mean, that's where it's really at.

1017
01:11:28,292 --> 01:11:32,708
Yeah. The love you give is equal to the love you get.

1018
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:36,625
Well, fuck it. I ain't doing it.

1019
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:37,833
- So long, Fritz.

1020
01:11:38,958 --> 01:11:41,250
- I ain't planting this bomb for you schmucks.

1021
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:08,917
Far out.

1022
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:24,458
Dr. Pooh, Dr. Pooh.

1023
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:29,542
And though after my skin worms

1024
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:34,625
destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God,

1025
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:36,792
whom I shall see for myself.

1026
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:39,708
- Fritz, Fritz! You gotta let us see our Fritz!

1027
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,083
- I'm sorry, girls. - Where is he?

1028
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,917
What have you done with him?

1029
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:43,583
- You can't go in there. You just can't.

1030
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:45,708
I'm sorry, girls. He's under house arrest.

1031
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,542
- Let us see him! Please!

1032
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:47,667
- No, no, no one gets in. - Please?

1033
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:50,167
He's hurt. - Lord Jesus

1034
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:51,958
and shalt believe in thine heart

1035
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:54,333
that God hath raised Him from the dead.

1036
01:13:57,625 --> 01:14:01,708
- I reckon he must be through, finished.

1037
01:14:06,792 --> 01:14:10,458
- For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness

1038
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:14,833
and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.

1039
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:18,500
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper

1040
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:23,542
but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them, shall have mercy.

1041
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:26,833
Fritz, we're so sorry, baby.

1042
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:46,250
Shh! He's trying to say something.

1043
01:14:50,958 --> 01:14:54,833
- I've been up and down the four corners

1044
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:58,000
of this big old world.

1045
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:02,167
I've seen it all

1046
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,792
and I've done it all.

1047
01:15:08,583 --> 01:15:10,250
I've fought many a good man

1048
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:15,333
and I've laid many a good woman.

1049
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:22,250
And if there's one thing I've learned

1050
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:28,500
it's, it's, you get over here!

1051
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:30,417
And you get down there like that!

1052
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:58,833
- Poor cat. He was a tough kid at that, wasn't he?

1053
01:16:15,833 --> 01:16:20,750
â™ª Down the lane they're strolling two by two â™ª

1054
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:30,500
â™ª Holding hands, they smile like we used to do â™ª

1055
01:16:35,667 --> 01:16:40,583
â™ª Here with their one and only â™ª

1056
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:46,292
â™ª I'd forgotten I was lonely â™ª

1057
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:49,000
â™ª Oh, how I wish â™ª

1058
01:16:49,292 --> 01:16:54,083
â™ª That here were there with you â™ª

1059
01:16:56,542 --> 01:17:01,458
â™ªAll the days of sadness â™ª

1060
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:06,458
â™ª They seem so needless now â™ª

1061
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:09,375
â™ª Yes, it's taken me â™ª

1062
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,167
â™ª This long, long time â™ª

1063
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:16,875
â™ª To see it's clear â™ª

1064
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:21,958
â™ª That my dreams keep drifting back to me â™ª

1065
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:29,833
â™ªAnd our strolls â™ª

1066
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:34,917
â™ª Beneath these same stars above â™ª

1067
01:17:36,792 --> 01:17:41,708
â™ªAnd when the leaves are falling â™ª

1068
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:47,708
â™ª My heart will be recalling â™ª

1069
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,750
â™ª You're the only girl â™ª

1070
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:54,000
â™ª I ever really loved â™ª
