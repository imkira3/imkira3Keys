Come on, guys!

789
01:05:05,596 --> 01:05:08,394
- Come on!
- Let's go! Follow me!

790
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,744
Oh, Crysta's gone.

Oh, look!

792
01:06:26,076 --> 01:06:28,806
We did it, Zak.

793
01:06:28,879 --> 01:06:32,337
Now Hexxus can never harm
FernGully again.

794
01:06:33,584 --> 01:06:35,518
But humans still could.

795
01:06:36,587 --> 01:06:39,351
That's why I have to go back.

796
01:06:40,891 --> 01:06:43,325
There's a part of me
that really wants to stay.

797
01:06:44,995 --> 01:06:47,964
There's a part of you
that will always stay.

798
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,473
Remember, Zak.

799
01:06:57,541 --> 01:06:59,805

01:07:19,229 --> 01:07:21,322
Keep the stereo, dude.

801
01:07:21,398 --> 01:07:24,299
- Thanks, dude.
- Hey, he's not going already?

802
01:07:24,368 --> 01:07:26,302
He was a nice guy.

803
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:31,171
- He just needed wings.
- What was done, now undo.

804
01:07:31,241 --> 01:07:34,142
Return you to the form...

805
01:07:34,211 --> 01:07:36,645
that's true.

806
01:07:36,714 --> 01:07:39,046
Good-bye, Zak.

807
01:07:48,792 --> 01:07:50,726

810
01:08:10,948 --> 01:08:13,746
- Zak!
- What happened here?

811
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:32,735
I will remember.

812
01:08:40,077 --> 01:08:42,204
Guys, things have gotta change.

813
01:08:43,447 --> 01:08:47,042
