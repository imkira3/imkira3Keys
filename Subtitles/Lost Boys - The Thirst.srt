2
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,679
As soon as you feed, Senator,
you won't need these anymore.

3
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,634
Holy shit!

4
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,078
It's the attack of Grandpa Munster!

5
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,999
Gross.

6
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,473
Damn it.

7
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,200
Sorry to ruin your party, Senator.

8
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,120
Don't worry,
we'll have you out of here in two minutes.

9
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,317
- Thank you.
- Edgar! Aah!

10
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,512
Alan? Alan!

11
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,998
Alan!

12
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,753
Alan.

13
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,874
Alan. Alan, are you okay?

14
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,195
No. No, Alan, no. No, Alan!

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Alan!

16
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,356
<i>I am a vampire.</i>

17
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,479
<i>Oh, yeah?
Well, abracadabra. I'm an umpire.</i>

18
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,951
<i>Hocus pocus.</i>

19
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,876
Mr. Frog?

20
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,195
Yeah?

21
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,954
Were you sleeping?

22
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,354
I work nights.

23
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,433
- Apparently not hard enough.
- Hmm.

24
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,233
You're in default on your loans...

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,869
...and the bank is repossessing
this property.

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,998
This would include any...

27
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,000
...structure currently
on the property as well.

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,119
- Are you serious?
- You have one week to vacate.

29
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,677
Have a good day.

30
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,870
Fucking vampires.

31
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,276
- Cash or store credit?
- Cash.

32
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,354
Comes to 65 even.

33
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,959
Sixty-five dollars?

34
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,875
Are you kidding me? I mean, this issue
of <i>Destroy All Vampires</i> number 125...

35
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,839
...in nearly mint condition
is worth 50 bucks alone.

36
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,798
In near-mint condition.

37
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,160
I know near-mint condition
and that ain't it.

38
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,551
What are you talking about?
I haven't even opened this book.

39
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,599
It's been boarded and bagged
since the day I got it.

40
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,955
Well, let's have a look.

41
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,479
There are stress marks
at the staple points.

42
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,349
The, uh, cover has lost at least 15 percent
of its gloss...

43
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,079
...the pages are yellow...

44
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,629
...and there's significant
rubbing and fading at the comers.

45
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,835
Hmm.

46
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,595
Now, if you were willing to part
with that <i>Batman</i> number 14...

47
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,274
...I, uh, might be able
to do a little bit better.

48
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,720
That's not gonna happen.

49
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,633
Happens to have
some sentimental value to it.

50
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,029
That's my offer, Frog.

51
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,952
Take it or leave it.

52
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,237
All right, pay me.

53
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,950
Have a nice day.

54
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,789
I hate happy people.

55
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,916
- Hmm.
- Hey, Edgar.

56
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,912
Did you make any money off of Frank?

57
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,756
Are you kidding?
He gave me 65 bucks for everything.

58
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,150
Ugh. He's such a cheapskate.

59
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,469
Here, let me see.

60
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,275
Uh, not that one.

61
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,516
But there's still some good stuff in here.

62
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,674
You want me to put it up on eBay,
see what I can get?

63
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,596
Uh, sure, why not.

64
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,990
Every little bit helps right now.

65
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,197
Where do I find the graphic novels?

66
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,680
You mean comic books.

67
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,992
No, I mean graphic novels.

68
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,396
I don't read comic books. I'm not a geek.

69
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,234
- Hmm.
- Oh, well, I can't help you then.

70
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,755
Here at the Book O'Neer, geek is chic.

71
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,315
- Try Bares & Noble.
- Whatever.

72
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,040
I guess you don't want me
to spend any money here.

73
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,439
That guy gets on my last nerve.

74
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,870
- You know him?
- By reputation only.

75
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,191
His name is Jonny Trash.

76
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,033
He's a celebrity blogger.

77
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,430
What the hell is he doing here
in San Cazador?

78
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,718
- They're here for the X-Party.
- The X-Party?

79
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,917
- “What's that?
- A rave.

80
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,354
And it's gonna be here?

81
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,919
If you believe the rumors.

82
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,960
But they're not telling anyone where
it's gonna be until the night of the event.

83
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,389
Great.

84
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,030
Sounds like the final nail in my coffin.

85
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,235
What...?

86
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,875
Bye.

87
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,955
Oh, shit!

88
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,589
Who the hell parked...?

89
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
My truck.

90
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,437
You sure don't look like a cold-blooded,
meaner-than-hell, badass vampire killer.

91
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,273
Excuse me?

92
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,238
You're Edgar Frog.

93
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,314
Sworn enemy to nightcrawlers
and bloodsuckers the world over.

94
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,233
I'm sorry, lady.

95
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,835
You must have me confused
with somebody else.

96
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,559
I'm Gwen. Gwen Lieber.

97
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,511
- Hi.
- And there is no confusion.

98
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,109
You are the same Edgar Frog
that destroyed covens...

99
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,478
...in Santa Carla, Luna Bay
and in Washington, D.C.

100
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,110
I have no idea what you're talking about.

101
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,997
Can we go inside to talk?

102
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,231
You got two minutes.

103
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
It's my brother, Peter.

104
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,711
He's been kidnapped.

105
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,469
A couple of years ago,
he started getting into trouble.

106
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,870
He was hanging out
with all the wrong kind of people.

107
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,155
Hmm.

108
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,111
And three weeks ago, he went
to Ibiza to this rave party thing...

109
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,674
...and he disappeared.

110
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,479
<i>He started following around
this guy, DJ X.</i>

111
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,791
<i>He throws these events called X-Parties.</i>

112
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,190
<i>Yeah, I've heard of him.</i>

113
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,913
Hi.

114
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,438
<i>The same people
that are throwing this party...</i>

115
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,553
<i>...are throwing similar parties
all over the world.</i>

116
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,317
<i>And at these raves,
they're handing out this new designer drug.</i>

117
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,990
<i>It's called the Thirst.</i>

118
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,391
- It comes in little ampoules like this one.
- Why would I care about...

119
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,393
...a bunch of drug addicts
with glow sticks?

120
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,437
Because the Thirst is not a drug.

121
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,830
It's vampire blood.

122
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,432
Nobody has seen him since.

123
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,394
Edgar, they are using these raves
to breed an army of vampires.

124
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,949
They're creating
their own global pandemic.

125
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,760
They've already infected hundreds
in Spain.

126
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,396
Done the same in Thailand, Rio
and in Greece.

127
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,120
And now the rumors say
that they're on their way here.

128
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,634
I'm not interested.

129
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,800
Look, I would obviously pay you
for your trouble.

130
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,999
And this could well be the last time that
you would have to do something like this.

131
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,912
All of my research suggests...

132
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,551
...that the Thirst is made from the blood
of the head vampire.

133
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,519
- The head vampire.
- The bloodsucking alpha.

134
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,432
- The alpha.
- From the Greek, "root"...

135
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,670
...meaning the first.

136
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,835
The original.

137
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,475
I knew that.

138
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,431
I'm still not interested.

139
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,311
And your two minutes are up.

140
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,473
I'm staying at the Hotel Cazador.

141
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,518
I truly hope that you'll reconsider.

142
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,679
I know you couldn't save your brother...

143
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,152
...but, Edgar,
maybe you can help me save mine.

144
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,478
Hmph.

145
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,278
Go and check on our guest, would you?

146
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,556
Hi, handsome.
How are you feeling?

147
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,475
Hmm. Poor little thing.

148
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,557
Just try to relax.

149
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,917
This will all be over soon.

150
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,156
Why would anyone
jump out of a perfectly good airplane?

151
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,470
Because it's so fucking fun!

152
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,718
You make sure our package arrives
in one piece.

153
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,757
And send someone to take care of Frog.

154
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,114
DJ X...

155
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,400
...the man behind the machine. I've been
whoring the fuck out of your next party...

156
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,949
...on my website,
and you can't even text me back?

157
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,636
You know how many media impressions
that is a day?

158
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,360
Don't put your hands on me, man.
I don't even know you.

159
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,990
That's our head of security, Kirk O'Dale.

160
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,835
There...

161
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,275
...now you know him,

162
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,591
Well, just wait a minute.
If you don't give an interview right now...

163
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,479
...then I swear I'll make it
my personal mission in life...

164
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,635
...to make sure that no one goes
to any more of your stupid parties ever.

165
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,473
Well, we wouldn't want that.

166
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,913
After all...

167
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,436
...ever is a long time.

168
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,238
Step into my office.

169
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,675
<i>I've got the blues.</i>

170
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,280
<i>I've got the blues.</i>

171
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,353
<i>I ain't got nothing but the blues.</i>

172
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,318
<i>Why did you go?</i>

173
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,471
Ugh. Creepy.

174
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,119
<i>Why did you go.</i>

175
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:39,838
<i>And leave me here with the blues?</i>

176
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,391
<i>You left me sad and you left me sore.</i>

177
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,194
<i>You left me with the lowdown blues.</i>

178
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,712
Hello, Edgar.

179
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,757
What brings you all the way down here?

180
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,514
Now I have to have an excuse
to visit my own brother?

181
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,876
At 1 in the morning, yeah.

182
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,031
I figured you'd be up.

183
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,278
I've recently learned
there's a nightcrawler...

184
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,115
...who's created a new designer drug
that he's handing out to kids at raves.

185
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,954
The only problem is it's not a drug...

186
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,269
it's vampire blood.

187
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,594
He's breeding an undead army...

188
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,031
...and the only thing that stands
between him...

189
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,636
...and the annihilation...

190
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,360
...of the entire human race...

191
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,358
...potentially...

192
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,675
...would be us.

193
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,991
The Frog Brothers.

194
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,354
We haven't been the Frog Brothers
for a long time.

195
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,513
Just...

196
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,799
- I can't do it without you.
- What about Sam?

197
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,473
Sam's gone.

198
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,871
He turned,
and, uh, I had to do what I had to do.

199
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,630
I guess that cancels out
Michael and Star.

200
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,954
Yeah. I'm pretty much persona non grata with
the entire Emerson family at this point.

201
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,236
- Laddie?
- He's moved on.

202
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,836
He's got a wife, kids.

203
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,069
He's got a real life now.

204
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,470
- Yeah, well, sodo I.
- You call this a life?

205
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,031
- This from a guy who lives in a trailer.
- Okay, so I've got nothing.

206
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,589
But at least I know what side I'm on!

207
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,673
Alan, if this is the head vampire,
then maybe we can kill him.

208
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,593
If we kill him, then we just
gotta find the one above him...

209
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,199
...and then on and on like that forever.
They are telling me that this is the alpha.

210
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,433
The 0.G. of all bloodsuckers,
the head vampire.

211
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,274
It's a pyramid scheme, Edgar.

212
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,555
Always has been.

213
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,717
What if this is it though?

214
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,030
What if this really is the head vampire?

215
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,713
Get this...

216
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,156
...and get it good, Edgar.

217
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,719
As far as I'm concerned...

218
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,756
...there's no such thing as vampires.

219
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,919
Hola, Trashynistas.
I'm sitting here with the one, the only...

220
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,912
DIX

221
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,754
I'm sorry for those of you
who have a shitty connection.

222
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,390
I guess you'll just have to take my word
for when I tell you...

223
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,519
...the man's absolutely scrumptious.

224
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,149
They'll just have to
come and see me in person.

225
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,960
Yeah, well,
they'll just have to get in line. Ha, ha.

226
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,114
So, DJ X,
why do you think the detached and the...

227
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,989
...you know, the disconnected youth
of today have latched on so fervently...

228
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,434
fo your parties?

229
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,039
Because I create a place...

230
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,955
...where all the lost souls of the world
can come together.

231
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,829
A place where they can do what they want...

232
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,640
...whenever they wanna do it.

233
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,475
Yeah, you heard it straight from
the man himself...

234
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,998
all you lost boys and girls. This is
gonna be the biggest rave of the century.

235
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,079
We'll let you know where it's gonna be
an hour before this event...

236
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,279
...50 stay tuned to this website
for the dees.

237
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,958
That was a great interview, X.

238
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,394
Thank you so much,

239
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,953
No, no, thank you...

240
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,793
...for getting the word out.

241
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,909
I wanna have as many people at this event
as possible.

242
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,593
It's my pleasure.

243
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,359
And I mean that.

244
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,715
So anyhow, what do you guys
have to drink in this jalopy?

245
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,715
You.

246
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,753
<i>Death to all vampires.</i>

247
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,558
<i>Maximum body count.</i>

248
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,313
We're awesome monster bashers.

249
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,393
- The meanest.
- The baddest.

250
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,875
Edgar.

251
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,680
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need weapons.

252
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,912
Lots of weapons.

253
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,070
Lots of really expensive,
custom-made weapons.

254
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,719
Well, of course. Come in.

255
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,749
Hmm.

256
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,000
Please have a seat.

257
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,639
So aren't you the least bit curious
on how I know so much about vampires?

258
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,875
Not really.

259
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,235
I know who you are.

260
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,951
You're Gwen Lieber. Bestselling author
of the <i>Eternity Kiss</i> series.

261
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,636
First of which is about to be made
into a major motion picture...

262
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,837
...coming soon to a theatre near you.

263
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,755
Oh, you've heard of me. I'm flattered.

264
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,514
Don't be. Your books suck.

265
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,753
I'm sorry you feel that way.

266
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,672
Doesn't really matter what I think.

267
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,798
You've got millions of emo-goth sheep
all over the world...

268
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,715
...who eat up every last word of it,
and keep coming back for more.

269
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,351
I'm sure you've made quite a nice living
off your supernatural bodice-rippers.

270
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,117
I'll have you know, I have gotten glowing
reviews from every major periodical.

271
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,999
Bought and paid for, I'm sure.

272
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,230
Just like me.

273
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,152
What is your problem, Frog?

274
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,435
My problem?

275
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,632
My problem is you glorify vampirism.

276
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,513
You make being a vampire look...

277
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,029
SEXY.

278
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,914
Well...

279
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,559
...there has always been an element
of eroticism in vampire mythology.

280
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,033
There is nothing sexy
about being a member of the undead.

281
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,517
Well, perhaps I have made a serious mistake
in coming to you.

282
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,878
If you came to me expecting me to ask
for your autograph, then yes, you did.

283
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,716
But if you came to me expecting
me to kill a shitload of vampires...

284
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,678
...that I can do.

285
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,280
Don't like the stake...

286
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,875
...maybe it needs a little garlic?

287
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,917
Here we go.

288
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,872
Freshly served.

289
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,355
Shit.

290
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,549
Eat that.

291
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,713
- Frog.
<i>- Edgar, it's Gwen.</i>

292
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,951
<i>Can you come by my hotel right away?</i>

293
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,519
<i>It's rather important.</i>

294
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,672
All right.
I'll be right there.

295
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,314
Hello, Edgar.

296
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,518
So, what's so important you need me
to come down here right away?

297
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,360
Well, I thought you should meet
your new partner.

298
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,912
When you turned me down,
I was desperate, so I hired someone else...

299
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,199
...and I'd really feel bad making him come
all the way from Hollywood for nothing.

300
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,435
Hollywood?

301
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,351
I don't like the sound of it. Who is this?

302
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,592
Lars Von Goetz?

303
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,915
Lars, this is...

304
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,514
Oh, yeah. The Toad.

305
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,393
Frog.

306
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,710
- Edgar Frog.
- That's what I said.

307
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,754
Yeah.

308
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,149
I'm Lars Von Goetz.

309
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,833
But you already knew that.

310
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,358
And this is Claus, my camera operator.

311
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,871
So let's go kick the shit
out of some little rave punks, huh?

312
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,758
But first, I gotta eat.

313
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,480
I got the metabolism
of a 12-year-old boy.

314
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,438
Can I speak with you for a minute?

315
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,673
Right.

316
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,600
Never fear, Lars Von Goetz is here.

317
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,595
As long as the check clears.

318
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,394
Lars Von Goetz?

319
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,154
You hired Lars Von Goetz?

320
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,917
- Thought you'd be happy.
- Happy?

321
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,516
First you expect me
to kill a head vampire...

322
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,593
then you expect me
to babysit some reality show reject?

323
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,916
You're not going to have to babysit him.

324
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,832
Haven't you seen his show?

325
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,278
The man's wrestled a grizzly bear,
alion and an alligator.

326
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,714
He's amazing.

327
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,200
That was staged.

328
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,830
All reality shows are staged, okay?

329
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,038
Von Goetz, whatever his name is,
he's a fraud.

330
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,360
Vampires are, like,
10 times stronger than grizzly bears.

331
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,158
Well, I think he can take care of himself.
We'll see about that.

332
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,920
That creepy guy's looking at me.

333
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,760
- WOMAN 2; Oh, gross.
- Here's the deal.

334
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,957
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need weapons.

335
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,709
Right. You said that.

336
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,638
I'll go see my guy tomorrow.

337
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,150
- You don't want me to come with you?
- No.

338
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,398
He's a little twitchy about new faces.

339
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,432
Listen, buddy, if you're looking
for the diet frozen-yogurt bar...

340
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,591
...it went out of business last summer.

341
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,479
Actually,
I'm looking for a Batman number 14.

342
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,199
That's a very serious book, man.

343
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,589
Only five in existence.

344
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,558
Four, actually.

345
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,519
I'm always looking out
for the other three.

346
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,072
<i>Edgar, since I know...</i>

347
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,437
<i>...I'll never be able to talk you
out of what you're about to do...</i>

348
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,357
<i>...I can't let you go up against a potential
head vampire without giving you this.</i>

349
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,990
<i>One of the first books on vampire hunting
ever written.</i>

350
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,233
<i>It hopefully keep you safe.
Watch your back. Alan.</i>

351
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,232
<i>P.S. If you're still alive on Tuesday,
be sure to call Mom.</i>

352
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,272
<i>It's her birthday.</i>

353
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,837
- <i>Book O'Neer.</i>
- Hey, Zoe.

354
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,798
<i>I need your help with something.</i>

355
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,918
- It's important.
<i>- Sure.</i>

356
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,991
I'll be waiting.

357
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,158
Wow, so the Gwen Lieber
hired you to find her kidnapped brother?

358
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,789
Yeah, and I think this book
might help me figure out...

359
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,160
...where they've taken him to.

360
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,113
I need you to scour it for any clues,
anything you can find.

361
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,150
I don't see how this old book is gonna
help you find anyone, but I'll give it a try.

362
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,313
Do me a favor.

363
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,636
If you happen to run across
anything in here...

364
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,078
that talks about human sacrifice
or anything like that, make note of it.

365
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,389
All right.

366
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,709
Cool.

367
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,475
Uh, do you wanna tell me why?

368
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,793
Not really.

369
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,520
Could put your life in danger.

370
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,314
Okay.

371
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,109
Oh, my gosh.

372
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,238
Where's Frog?

373
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,474
Back off, fucko!

374
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,349
Or what? You gonna mace me?

375
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,794
Somebody needed a light?

376
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,714
Frog.

377
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,078
Ugly.

378
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,515
You're dead.

379
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,237
Suck on this.

380
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,639
Watch out!

381
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,797
Nice.

382
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,514
Mace?

383
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,591
Holy water.

384
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,238
I feel like pancakes.

385
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,913
Order up.

386
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,078
I found a whole section
of young male vampire sacrifices.

387
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,231
And look, there's a Blood Moon.

388
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,280
They call it that because the moon's face
is deep red or crimson hue.

389
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,798
So they're gonna make a sacrifice
under the Blood Moon.

390
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,995
Exactly.

391
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,630
This Friday is a Blood Moon.

392
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,314
So they're gonna
sacrifice Peter at the rave.

393
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,479
- Well, Edgar, you can't let that happen.
- All right, if I'm gonna do this...

394
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,837
...I need to find out where the rave is
and I need to find out fast.

395
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,230
Well, technically, raves are illegal...

396
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,631
...50 the promoters aren't gonna say
where it is until the last minute.

397
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,997
You said that the rumor is that
it was gonna be here in San Cazador.

398
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,477
Even if it is here,
San Cazador is a big place.

399
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:47,000
If we're gonna find out where that nest is,
we need to learn how to think like a vampire.

400
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,470
Bloodsuckers have a tendency
to look for a place...

401
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,156
that's got a history
of suffering and death.

402
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,630
You know of a place like that here?

403
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,633
There's an old slaughterhouse
on San Cazador Island.

404
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,355
Slaughterhouse?

405
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,469
Perfect.

406
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,190
<i>Nothing vampires love more
than blood and carnage.</i>

407
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,395
<i>If there's a slaughterhouse on that island,
that's where they ll be.</i>

408
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,351
Let me go.

409
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,473
- I promise, I...
- Uh-uh-uh.

410
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,151
Let's not make any promises
we can't keep.

411
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,559
You just lie here
like a good piece of veal...

412
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,831
...and maybe I'll bring you
a nice glass of warm milk.

413
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,035
Hmm,

414
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,394
So where are we going?

415
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,278
My friend likes his privacy.

416
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,555
The name's Blake.

417
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,839
Used to be a congressman
before he leamed the truth.

418
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,352
What's up with all the razor wire?

419
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,232
Yo, Blake. Open up.

420
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,113
It's Edgar.

421
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,949
Phew. Edgar.

422
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,270
- How's it hanging?
- What's up, Blake?

423
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,079
Holy-water grenade.

424
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,435
- Nice touch.
- Yeah.

425
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,069
- Needs a little work, though.
- Yeah.

426
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,560
Who the hell's this?

427
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,751
Oh, this is Zoe.

428
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,155
She's cool.

429
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,913
Yeah, I'll be the judge of that.

430
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,632
Touch the cross. Do it now.

431
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,519
Zoe, manners.

432
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,872
- Nice to meet you.
- Blake.

433
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,714
What's with the bike?

434
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,236
Oh, that's a beauty.
I've been working on her for a full year.

435
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,074
Renovations, the lot.
She's gonna be a real killer.

436
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,232
Yeah, Unfortunately, wouldn't do us
much good on this mission.

437
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,035
What else you got?

438
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,640
Welcome to the lair.

439
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,353
What happened to this thing?

440
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,957
Looks like something
blew up in the barrel.

441
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,509
You should see the vampire
I was pointing it at.

442
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,394
Let's just say the gun came out
on the winning side.

443
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,873
Nice new stuff, Blake.

444
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,075
I like it.

445
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,234
You looking for something
to replace your Old Reliable?

446
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,669
Never.

447
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,558
Ah, you say that now.

448
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,269
Feast your eyes on this.

449
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,910
An old Russki RG-6 grenade launcher.

450
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,793
Whoa.

451
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,235
Heavy.

452
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,032
Fires 40 mm fragmentation grenades.

453
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,474
Not this one.

454
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,631
This one fires these.

455
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,869
What is it? Holy water?

456
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,474
Mixed with a little garlic.

457
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,789
Just for giggles.

458
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,117
- I'll take it.
- I thought you might.

459
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,879
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

460
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,635
What's this?

461
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,677
Hey, put that down, please.

462
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,672
Very carefully, okay?

463
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,434
That is a prototype resin grenade.

464
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,991
I stole it from a military testing facility
at Groom Lake.

465
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,516
- What does it do?
- Oh, shit,

466
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,112
Cool.

467
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,318
Yeah, cool.

468
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,596
I will take that other resin grenade,
though.

469
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,199
Gotta hand it to the grays...

470
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,558
...they sure are good at making weapons.

471
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,000
Well, it's a pleasure doing business
with you, Edgar, as always.

472
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,230
Mm.

473
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,114
Say, you guys wanna stay for dinner?
I got beans.

474
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,629
Yeah, you do.

475
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,594
What the hell are these?

476
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,239
Those?

477
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,437
- Those are, uh...
- A reminder.

478
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,109
Vampires.

479
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,635
They must have tracked us here.

480
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,956
- What did you do to them?
- High-powered UV lamps.

481
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,509
Edgar, all the weapons are in the car.

482
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,431
I guess we're gonna have to improvise.

483
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,956
They've taken out the UV lights.

484
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,553
Hi, sweetheart,
aren't you gonna invite me in?

485
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,314
No. You're not invited.

486
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,393
Wait. Where are you going?

487
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,151
Holy shit, we gotta get out of here.

488
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,879
They'll kill us if we go outside.

489
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,600
I'd rather be bit than burned.
Come on, let's go!

490
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,716
- Hi there.
- Guys, get down!

491
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,552
Say hello to Old Painless.

492
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,549
Now, that's what I call a stakeout.

493
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,274
It's cool, right?

494
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,272
Yeah, it should be. It's my design.

495
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,916
If all of these freaks go to the island
and take the Thirst at the rave...

496
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,199
...we're gonna have a full-on
vampire invasion on our hands.

497
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,432
Okay, man, you got the glow sticks?

498
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,358
Let's roll.

499
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,074
Oh, yeah.

500
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,152
Oh, yes.

501
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,674
Hey. You didn't tell me...

502
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,877
- ...Lars Von Goetz was gonna be here.
- Yeah.

503
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,156
- I was kind of hoping he wasn't.
- Oh, yeah.

504
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,280
- That guy is a total animal.
- Yes, baby.

505
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,835
You see the episode
where he wrestled the grizzly bear?

506
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,274
- Missed it.
- Oh, yeah.

507
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,440
Toad.

508
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,038
Hmm.

509
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,194
So, hmm, who's your friend?

510
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,314
Hi. I'm Zoe.

511
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,515
Zoe.

512
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,519
Tell me, Zoe, is it just me...

513
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,350
...or is there some serious chemistry
between us?

514
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,994
That's just you.

515
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,878
Okay.

516
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,229
Edgar.

517
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,391
I hope you brought your bathing suit.

518
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,074
I thought we should blend in
with the other partygoers.

519
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,313
EDGAR; Covert infiltration.

520
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,629
It's a good idea.

521
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,719
Hi, I'm Gwen.

522
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,078
Yeah, I know.
I've sold, like, a bazillion of your books.

523
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,914
- I'm Zoe.
- Right.

524
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,273
You work in a bookstore?

525
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,869
Part-time.

526
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,874
And Edgar thinks that you're qualified
for this mission?

527
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,278
Just how many bloodsuckers
have you killed, Miss Lieber?

528
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,799
- None.
- More qualified than you.

529
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,193
Well, this is Edgar's show,
and I trust him.

530
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,314
Did I mention I hated her books?

531
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,709
Sodol.

532
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,231
Rave!

533
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,320
All right, everybody.
According to the blueprints...

534
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,519
...there's an entrance to the slaughterhouse
through a series of underground tunnels...

535
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,196
...which will lead us directly
to where the rave is.

536
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,355
Now, remember, everyone,
there will be a lot of civilians around.

537
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,275
Toadies, not familiars.

538
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,479
Just innocent partygoers who are all there
because they think they're gonna have...

539
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,313
fun.

540
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,791
Because of this, you will be armed...

541
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,998
...with weapons that are non-lethal
to anything with a heartbeat.

542
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,509
This is a sawed-off, pump action,
Soak and Destroy water gun.

543
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,995
Patent pending.

544
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,149
Turns holy water...

545
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,755
...into holy slaughter.

546
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,519
Zoe, you take it.

547
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,715
Claus...

548
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,037
...it's a high-powered UV torch,

549
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,113
Tie it around your waist.
You'll thank me later.

550
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,237
Okay, what about me?

551
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,275
You're staying here.

552
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,989
The hell I am!

553
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,197
This is my brother we are talking about.

554
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,317
I understand that...

555
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,955
...but this is not one of your books,
Gwen.

556
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,153
Everybody on this mission
is a trained veteran.

557
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,593
You could be killed, or worse...

558
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,276
- ...you could be turned into one of them.
- Okay, time out.

559
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,149
Listen, Gwen, I totally buy into
your little vampire goth games...

560
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,233
that's what you're paying me to do,
but I'm calling bullshit.

561
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,959
If Gwen wants to go, she can go.

562
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,354
Not as long as I'm in charge
of this mission.

563
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,238
It's all right, Lars.

564
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,869
Listen to him.
Edgar knows what he's talking about.

565
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,872
He's an experienced vampire hunter.

566
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,112
Wrong. I'm sorry to be the one
to break this to you...

567
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,874
...but there are no
experienced vampire hunters...

568
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,919
...because there are no vampires.
They do not exist.

569
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,753
Hmm.

570
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,192
Zoe, take these stakes,
strap them to your leg.

571
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,038
And why does she get stakes?

572
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,714
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were Mr. Tough Guy...

573
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,839
...who wrestled a 6-foot alligator with
your bare hands. You don't need weapons.

574
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,071
No, it was 10-foot.

575
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,311
- And I still want stakes.
- Fine.

576
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,354
There's some stakes.

577
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,269
Why are hers metal?

578
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,952
You get what you get.

579
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,398
Let's go.

580
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,115
Edgar, wait.

581
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,959
Bring him back safe.

582
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,872
I'll do my best.

583
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,429
Move out.

584
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,195
Hey, Toad.

585
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,751
Couldn't we come back at night?
It would look so much better on camera.

586
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,150
No. Vampires feed at night...

587
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,796
...and I don't plan on
sticking around for dinner.

588
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,275
Is this the VIP room?

589
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,474
Oh, most definitely.

590
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,634
- When's the party supposed to start?
- Not for a while.

591
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,633
You guys got here early.

592
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,200
Oh, are those promise rings?

593
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,671
- So cute.
- Is that blood on your face?

594
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,959
Oh! I think I just broke my coccyx.

595
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,430
Forget the coccy, is the camera okay?

596
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,156
- Radio check.
- Check.

597
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,670
- Check.
- Check.

598
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:55,913
All right. Once inside,
our main objective is to extract Peter.

599
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,680
Killing vampires is our second priority.

600
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,952
All right, everybody...

601
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,349
Jet's rock 'n' roll.

602
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,753
Heads up.

603
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,232
Hey, did you name your new gun yet?

604
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,913
Shh.

605
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,434
What?

606
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,638
Did you name your new gun yet?

607
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,677
What are you talking about?

608
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,797
All guns need a name.

609
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,473
Like boats.

610
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,438
Boats are for sailors...

611
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,240
...guns are for soldiers.

612
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,391
I'm no sailor.

613
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,993
- Lars.
- What?

614
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,436
I'm getting a really
bad feeling about this.

615
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,470
Ugh. What, you mean being deep within
the earth beneath a thousand tons of rock?

616
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,110
Are you feeling "Claus-trophobic"?

617
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,996
Get it? "Claus-trophobic"?

618
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,595
That's not funny.
I'm serious, man, look around you.

619
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,990
This shit's freaking me out.

620
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,839
Jeepers.

621
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,679
All right, here's the deal.

622
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,354
We're gonna go to the left,
you guys go to the right.

623
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,193
Zoe, you're with me.

624
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,149
Lars and Claus, do whatever it is you do.

625
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,630
We'll reconvene back on the beach...

626
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,518
...maybe.

627
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,440
You know,
I kind of hate the fact we split up.

628
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,911
People in horror movies always split up
and they always get killed.

629
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,674
There's nothing to worry about, Claus.
Don't you get it?

630
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,797
This is all some stupid role-playing game.

631
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,033
All we're gonna find is some little emo goth
kids with fake fangs and contact lenses.

632
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,838
You think this is a game?

633
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,358
Of course I think it's a game. Why else
would the Toad give me a water pistol?

634
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,430
Besides, my fans are tired of seeing me
tackle every natural predator on the planet.

635
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,876
Now, we need to give them
something new to watch.

636
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,195
But if you're right...

637
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,115
...you're gonna be beating up a bunch
of kids with fake fangs and contact lenses.

638
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,714
I know.

639
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,069
Isn't it great?

640
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,439
This is the entrance
to the slaughterhouse.

641
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,070
Time for Mr. Frog's wild ride.

642
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,439
Ow.

643
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,473
Claus, we gotta find a place
to do my intro.

644
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,960
Oh, yeah.

645
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,389
This is perfect.

646
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,718
Okay.

647
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,795
Using my tracking ability,
we've located the nest of the vampires...

648
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,793
...deep within
this abandoned slaughterhouse.

649
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,793
It's also haunted...

650
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,429
...by cannibal pirates.

651
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,550
It's built on an
ancient Indian burial ground...

652
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,954
...where they used to burn witches.

653
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,989
Oh.

654
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,953
A promise ring.

655
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,554
Virgins.

656
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,156
<i>Vampire fillet mignon.</i>

657
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,313
Ugh. What kind of fucked up shit is this?

658
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,312
Are you Peter?

659
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,111
Please, help me.

660
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,678
Dude. Turn around, let's go.

661
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,751
- What?
- It's too early to find him.

662
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,036
We gotta find him
at the end of the episode.

663
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,397
I haven't even had the chance
to put the beat-down on any goths yet.

664
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,756
- But he's right here.
- Dude, turn around.

665
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,558
Sorry, Peter. Let's go.

666
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,040
What the fuck?

667
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,914
Where are you bastards going?

668
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,120
Something smells really bad in here.

669
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,157
It's a slaughterhouse.

670
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,917
I don't mean the typical
bad slaughterhouse dead meat smell...

671
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,198
- ...I mean I smell something...
- It smells like rotting garbage.

672
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,509
Trash.

673
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,030
Yeah, like I said. Rotting garbage.

674
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,235
No.

675
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,758
I mean Jonny Trash.

676
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,193
Jeez Louise.

677
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,280
Jeez Louise? Really?

678
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,679
Zoe, get down!

679
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,876
- You hear that?
- What?

680
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,358
I think it's coming from down there.

681
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,435
What are you doing?

682
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,238
Lars.

683
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,994
Lars.

684
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,714
Dude, where's my gear?

685
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,958
You left it up...

686
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,714
Oh, shit.

687
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,194
What?

688
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,391
Oh, okay.

689
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,794
Is this it?

690
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,233
I've been waiting 300 years
for a good fight.

691
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,036
Have you had enough, punk?

692
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,720
Nice outfit.

693
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,279
That's funny...

694
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,956
...that's exactly what I was thinking.

695
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,599
But I still have to kill you.

696
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,759
I'm surprised.

697
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,279
By what?

698
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,913
You're really not that good.

699
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,436
- Aah!
- Edgar!

700
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,233
Zoe. I got this.

701
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,073
Ah, shit! Damn bullets!

702
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,314
See, now that's what happens
when you don't name your gun.

703
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,312
Just pull out the sword!

704
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,996
- On three.
- Okay.

705
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,470
Three.

706
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,400
What happened to one and two?

707
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,791
Edgar? Edgar? Oh, God.

708
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,633
Lars, what's your 20?

709
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,039
- It's not Lars, it's Claus.
- Claus, where's Lars?

710
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,235
<i>He's dead.</i>

711
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,669
Lars is dead.

712
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,309
We're so completely and totally fucked.

713
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,232
Claus, calm down. Just breathe.

714
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,638
We have to get Edgar out of here
before reinforcements arrive.

715
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,191
- Oh, my God. Zoe, what happened?
- Just help us lay him down.

716
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,112
Claus, first-aid kit.

717
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,750
Hang in there.
Everything's gonna be fine.

718
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,274
Hold this.

719
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,115
Edgar, stay with me.

720
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,156
Notice anything unusual
about Santa Carla yet?

721
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,239
No, it's a pretty cool place...

722
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,470
if you're a Martian.

723
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,869
Or a vampire.

724
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,190
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint
or something?

725
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,079
You think you know what's
happening around here, don't you?

726
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,914
Well, I'll tell you something.
You don't know shit, buddy.

727
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,960
Yeah. You think we just work
in a comic-book store for our folks, huh?

728
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,157
Actually, I thought it was a bakery.

729
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,515
This is just our cover.

730
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,149
We're dedicated to a higher purpose.

731
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,755
We're fighters for truth...

732
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,274
justice...

733
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,351
...and the American way.

734
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,358
Edgar.

735
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,794
- Edgar.
- What?

736
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,031
- What happened to me?
- You're okay.

737
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,718
Did we get him? Did we get Peter?

738
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,157
Claus found him,
but they ran into some trouble.

739
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,036
They had him tied
to some twisted table kind of thing...

740
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,794
...pumping him full of drugs,
trying to keep him sedated.

741
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,594
Where's your boss? Von Geek?

742
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,037
Some big-ass, massive juggernaut
of a vampire got him.

743
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,991
Tore his heart right out of his chest.

744
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,829
Got it on tape, though.

745
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,191
I'd like to see that
when we get a chance.

746
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,874
- He'd like that.
- Thanks.

747
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,154
Gwen...

748
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,678
...it's gonna be okay.

749
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,918
We'll get him.

750
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,117
It's not over yet.

751
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,435
Payback's a bitch.

752
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,955
Damn straight. Let's go.

753
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,593
Rave! Rave!

754
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,629
It's starting.

755
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,198
All right, come on.

756
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,399
Hey!

757
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,399
Hey, there.

758
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,630
Do you wanna party?

759
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:30,111
And now,
the man you've been waiting for, DJ X!

760
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:51,278
Are you ready for a sacrifice?

761
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,473
Blood, blood, blood!

762
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:09,039
Blood, blood, blood!

763
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,235
Hold up.

764
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,560
Oh, my God.
There he is.

765
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,433
If they get through that fence,
we're so undeniably fucked.

766
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,553
The sooner we take out X,
the sooner that won't be a problem.

767
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,199
Okay, but what about Peter?

768
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,353
All right, listen up, everyone.
I want you all to hold back.

769
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,113
I've only got one shot at this.

770
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,358
I'm gonna immobilize X
and then we go in for the kill.

771
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,955
Everybody, stay put. Got it?

772
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,673
- Got it.
- Good.

773
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,436
Put on something nasty, X.

774
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,989
I think I found someone
I wanna dance with.

775
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,997
He dropped it. I'm going in.

776
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,793
Zoe, wait.

777
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,519
Get in here and help me. Come on.

778
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:10,400
That is exactly
how I'm going to break your neck.

779
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,039
Vinyl still shreds.

780
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,356
Very creative, Frog.

781
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,071
But when it comes to killing...

782
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:47,270
...I prefer more traditional methods...

783
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,239
like impalement.

784
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,273
Claus, cover us!

785
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,077
Shit, Shit.

786
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,755
You fought admirably.

787
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:02,074
But you were doomed to fail
from the start.

788
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,158
I've fought beside great warriors...

789
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,833
...leamed battle techniques...

790
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,949
...that can only be mastered
over several lifetimes.

791
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,995
And do you know
what the first rule of combat is?

792
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,550
Yeah, don't monologue.

793
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,637
There's a lot of vampires down here.

794
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,996
Guys, I can't hold them off forever.

795
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,117
Fuck me. Fuck me!

796
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,914
Edgar!

797
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,152
Nice work.
I've got it.

798
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,839
You're right. Impalement is good.

799
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,234
Especially when you pierce the heart.

800
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,598
Peter.

801
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,311
All right, everybody, listen up.
The party's officially over.

802
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,950
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

803
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,397
Peter, can you hear me?

804
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,197
- Eew.
- Buckets of eew.

805
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,869
Edgar, something's wrong.

806
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,314
Yeah, I'd say.

807
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:45,838
No, I mean we killed DJ X,
but I don't feel any different.

808
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,634
Something's wrong.

809
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,311
They're still vampires. Nothing's changed.

810
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,153
Edgar...

811
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,596
...this smells like garlic.

812
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,038
Garlic?

813
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,679
Let me see.

814
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,277
You're right, it...
They were keeping him weak.

815
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,557
You're the alpha.

816
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,791
Oh, I bet you did not see that coming.

817
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,834
Thanks to you.

818
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,277
If X had been able to drink my blood
during the Blood Moon...

819
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,909
...my power would have passed to him...

820
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,634
...and that would have been a shame.

821
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,509
I've been the alpha for a long, long time.

822
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,350
You'll never grow old, you'll never die...

823
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,558
...but you must feed.

824
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,672
I brought you Edgar Frog,
just like you asked.

825
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,319
Now it is your turn.

826
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,359
Remember your promise to me.

827
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,355
I just don't wanna grow old. Sorry.

828
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,638
Oh...

829
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,355
...you won't,

830
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,431
They're all yours!

831
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,839
Alan, wait!

832
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,389
No, no, no, this is not a good time
for the batteries to die.

833
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,791
Claus, I need you to get Zoe to safety.

834
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,430
Edgar, I'm not leaving without you.

835
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,034
If we don't kill Peter right now...

836
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,397
there's gonna be a thousand
emo-goth vampires out there.

837
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,876
I need you to wam the world.

838
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,792
Especially in case I don't survive.

839
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,118
That's not an option.

840
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,869
I'll be waiting.

841
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,599
Just go.

842
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,635
Come on.

843
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,278
Claus.

844
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,197
I'm disappointed in you, Edgar.

845
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,069
This is no way to treat your savior.

846
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:04,074
Savior? You got a funny way
of looking at things, kid.

847
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,476
I saved you from a life of loneliness.

848
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,192
You didn't want to end up
like Robert Neville, did you? Ha, ha.

849
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:13,876
- Robert who?
- You really should read more books, Edgar.

850
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,154
The ones without pictures
and word balloons.

851
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,713
Robert Neville,
the protagonist in <i>I Am Legend.</i>

852
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:27,073
Last man on Earth
in a world full of vampires.

853
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,752
Is that really what you want to become?

854
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,716
I'm not thirsty.
You'll have to kill me first.

855
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,233
I will, if necessary.

856
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,916
But that would be a shame...

857
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,436
...especially since I owe you a debt
for killing X.

858
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,396
Why didn't you just kill him yourself?

859
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,718
A father can't murder his own children.

860
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,076
That would be in bad taste.

861
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,198
Even an impertinent little shit like DJ X.

862
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:09,792
I fold him you can't tum all the cattle
into cowboys...

863
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,839
...you'll wind up with too many cowboys.

864
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,035
But he didn't listen.

865
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,952
And now, thanks to his damned raves...

866
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:19,590
...there are going to be far too many
vampires roaming the Earth.

867
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,909
That's where you come in.

868
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,959
Keep the population down
to a manageable size.

869
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,678
Plenty of blood to drink.

870
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,991
Everybody's happy.

871
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,480
Precisely.

872
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:35,953
Which is why I want you to keep on doing
what you're already so very good at.

873
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,913
Hunting and killing vampires.

874
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,274
So you want me to be your own personal
hemo-sucking hit man, is that it?

875
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,999
Crudely worded...

876
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,478
...but, yes, that's the general idea.

877
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,950
And what makes you think...

878
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,112
that I won't just kill you myself?

879
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,395
Nothing.

880
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,989
Except that you have no real reason.

881
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,758
Think about it, Edgar.

882
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,480
Your brother's already one of us.

883
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:13,874
Everyone you care about
is either dead or playing for my team.

884
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,875
What do you say?

885
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,949
I say...

886
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,438
...why don't you go suck yourself?

887
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,031
Alan, kill your brother.
You'll feel better.

888
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:28,835
Alan, no.

889
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,471
Don't do this.

890
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,999
You're my brother.

891
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,719
You're a Frog Brother.

892
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:44,358
Don't make me hurt you.

893
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,196
I told you not to make me hurt you.

894
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,199
Last chance, Edgar.

895
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,239
What the fuck?

896
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,518
Fuck you!

897
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,878
You okay?

898
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,034
Yeah.

899
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,554
Fang check.

900
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,319
Hmm.

901
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,033
Death to all vampires?

902
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,918
Maximum body count.

903
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,038
We are awesome monster bashers.

904
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,958
- The meanest.
- The baddest.

905
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,478
That's enough of that.

906
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,716
Hey. I thought you went to the beach
with your brother?

907
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,073
I did, actually, but, uh,
he wanted to stay out there longer.

908
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,949
He stays out much longer, he's gonna
turn info a human piece of beef jerky.

909
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,958
I guess he's making up for lost time.

910
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,509
- Yeah.
- Oh, guess what.

911
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:30,037
I sold your copy of <i>Destroy All Vampires</i>
number 125...

912
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,158
...for 500 bucks.

913
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,435
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

914
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,715
That's great.

915
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,633
That should keep the bank off my butt
for a while.

916
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,156
Now, Zoe,
there's something I need to ask you.

917
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,638
How did you know vampires are real?

918
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,552
Just a hunch.

919
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,839
What are you reading?

920
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,396
Oh, I'm actually scanning the book
into my Kindle.

921
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,709
I decided, you know...

922
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,437
...I might as well educate myself about all
the possibilities of the dark underworld.

923
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,718
For example,
did you know that lycanthrope...

924
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:05,157
...or female werewolves, she-wolves...

925
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,798
...actually can change
anytime they want to?

926
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,713
They don't have to do it under a full moon.
That's a myth.

927
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,951
They can turn anytime they want to.

928
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:17,238
They have complete control.
They can do it in the middle of the day.

929
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,598
Now, that's an interesting theory.

930
01:17:23,305 --> 01:18:23,167
