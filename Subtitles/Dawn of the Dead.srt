wanna go that way.

over this way are locked.

going to get in here. Mmm.

And you probably already thought
about putting a sign up on the roof.

300

Because, you know, there's
still planes in the air.

Let them know we're alive.

We can get some paint
from Case Hardware.

to board up the weak spots.

Why don't you start off by cleaning
up that mess you made in Metropolis?

them in the head.

you to stay alive. You hear me?

a mouth on you.

Somebody should show her
how to use it.

Is there a holding
cell in there?

of the security room.

That's not part of the plan.

from the same jackass who
told us to go to St. Verbena?

Yeah.

dipshit on the radio said it was safe there.

00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,770
He was wrong. Is that
where you picked them up?

531
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:05,314
Well, I get this call on
the C.B. From that guy Glen

532
00:45:05,397 --> 00:45:08,858
saying all these folks
are in the chapel.

He's a priest?
No, he plays the organ.

534
00:45:12,028 --> 00:45:15,074
I was in the neighborhood,
so I picked them up.

that they all, sort of,

Frank said she was
walking on her own

590

when she got in the truck
five hours ago.

591
00:50:00,181 --> 00:50:03,185
The bites killed her.
The bites brought her back.

592

How do you know?
I watched it happen.

593

I felt her pulse.
She was gone.

594
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:11,901
Then... Yesterday I saw the same
thing happen to somebody else.

595
00:50:14,237 --> 00:50:16,823
I think that's why
it spread so fast.

All right.

597
00:50:23,495 --> 00:50:25,997
So who else
in the group is bitten?

Frank, for sure.

599

How about the one
with the foot?

600
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:31,336
Tucker?
He says no, he fell.

601
00:50:32,212 --> 00:50:34,549
So, it's Frank.
Tall guy, right?

602
00:50:34,924 --> 00:50:37,801
Right. So we have to
quarantine him right away.

Where exactly do we do that?

604
00:50:39,971 --> 00:50:42,098
I don't know. There must be
someplace to keep him in here.

605

Then what?

606
00:50:44,974 --> 00:50:46,768
I don't know, but...

607
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,230
It's too dangerous
to keep him on here.

I'm sorry. What are we
talking about here?

609

Are we talking
about killing him?

610
00:50:57,654 --> 00:50:59,073
Would you rather
we waited for him to die,

611
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,615
and then he tries
to kill us?

612
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:02,909
Yes. No. You can't kill him. Ana...

I'm sorry.

I don't think
there's any other choice.

615

He's right.

What if I'm wrong?

happen before.

to shoot you.

What are you talking about?

621
00:51:30,936 --> 00:51:34,146
You're infected. You're
gonna become one of them.

622
00:51:36,985 --> 00:51:40,362
Is this true?
Are you gonna kill me?

623
00:51:41,863 --> 00:51:43,782
You've been bitten.
It's only a matter of time.

624
00:51:43,866 --> 00:51:47,869
No, no, no! Leave my dad alone! Go away!

625
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:49,997
You can't do this!

626

You have to understand
that she's lost everyone.

627

Her mother,
her two brothers.

628

I'm all she's got.

629
00:52:06,637 --> 00:52:11,225
Well, Michael, what are you
waiting for? Go ahead, kill him.
