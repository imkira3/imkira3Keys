2
00:00:41,884 --> 00:00:44,339
<i>Technically speaking, I'm an alien.</i>

3
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:49,274
<i>And from the perspective
of immigration, an illegal one.</i>

4
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:55,093
<i>My parents met at the university in Saint
Petersburg where he taught astrophysics</i>

5
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:58,049
<i>and she taught applied mathematics.</i>

6
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:01,089
<i>My mother fell in love with him
when she found him almost frozen to death</i>

7
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:05,013
<i>on the bank of the Neva,
staring at the stars.</i>

8
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:14,749
Tonight, the sky is completely
full of miracles.

9
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,275
<i>My mother won't talk much
about that time.</i>

10
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,528
<i>But my aunt Nino told me
about my father.</i>

11
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:23,203
Max...

12
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:27,891
<i>His name was Maximilian Jones
and he was the son of an English diplomat</i>

13
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:31,414
<i>who always saw the best in people.</i>

14
00:01:35,063 --> 00:01:37,275
<i>I often wonder if what happened
to my mother and father</i>

15
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,775
<i>changed me from someone
who might have seen the best in people</i>

16
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,328
<i>to someone who always expects
the worst.</i>

17
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:46,242
How's my Jupiter?

18
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:54,943
Not a planet. The planet.

19
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:59,735
The biggest and most beautiful planet
in our solar system.

20
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:03,876
She is our Jupiter.

21
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:08,252
Over my dead body
we will name her "Jupiter."

22
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:16,034
Soon you will discover that your mother can
be extraordinarily unreasonable at times.

23
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:22,870
But fortunately for us, she remains
susceptible to your father's particular...

24
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,134
charm.

25
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:42,217
No, oh, no, oh, no!
No, not the telescope, please!

26
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:44,855
Don't take the telescope, please!

27
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:53,113
Max! Ma...

28
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:18,671
<i>In her grief, my mother pushed everyone
except her sister out of her life.</i>

29
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,535
<i>Somewhere in the middle
of the Atlantic,</i>

30
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:27,823
<i>she pushed me out too.</i>

31
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:30,969
Pusha. Pusha!

32
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:38,627
<i>I was born without a country.
Without a home.</i>

33
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:41,184
<i>Without a father.</i>

34
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:48,678
<i>But I was born in the house of Leo...</i>

35
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:55,891
<i>with Jupiter rising at twenty-three
degrees ascendant.</i>

36
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,533
<i>According to my aunt,</i>

37
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:03,624
<i>this is supposed to mean
that I am destined for great things</i>

38
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:07,666
<i>and that I will find
the one true love of my life.</i>

39
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,960
- Jupiter.
- Coming!

40
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,263
- You finish the bathroom yet?
- Not yet.

41
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:20,056
- We still have another house tonight.
- I'll be fast.

42
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:23,687
<i>Problem with astrology?</i>

43
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:28,234
<i>Total bullshit.</i>

44
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,713
What was the name of this planet?

45
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:26,251
Zalintyre, I think.

46
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:29,233
Have you ever seen a harvest?

47
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,729
Oh, no. Never!

48
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:35,735
But I've heard they feel no pain.

49
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,357
It's all quite humane,
from what I've been told.

50
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:40,360
Well, there are marshals
and administrators

51
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,217
to make sure everything's done
according to code, but still...

52
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:45,939
It can be rather... affecting.

53
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:49,211
Now you sound like Mother.

54
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:55,123
Most of them were miserable in their lives
and what we do for them is a mercy.

55
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:58,095
Balem, thank you for responding.

56
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:01,485
We were just admiring this ledger
from your latest success.

57
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:02,971
Well done, brother.

58
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,427
The house of Abrasax
continues to thrive,

59
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:08,582
despite the squandering
of your inheritance, brother.

60
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:11,304
I must say, you're looking
a little worse for wear.

61
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,193
Could it be success
does not agree with you?

62
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:16,815
And you look so well.

63
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:19,787
Could it be that failure
agrees with you?

64
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:23,870
You may have inherited Mother's head
for business, but I inherited her heart.

65
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,582
And what does that leave me?

66
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,037
- Her beauty.
- Liar.

67
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,271
- Her humor.
- Her unluckiness in love?

68
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:33,147
Her fetish for wrinkles.

69
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:35,468
Well, if this is to be another
of your eulogies, Titus,

70
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:37,939
I have more important matters to attend.

71
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,310
It was her birthday recently.

72
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,583
You know I get sentimental, and I was going
through some of Mother's old sheave-work

73
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:47,648
and I came across a description of a planet
she claimed was the most rare

74
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:51,733
and beautiful estate she ever owned.

75
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:55,223
- I believe she named it...
- Earth.

76
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:59,415
...earth. It was part of your inheritance,
wasn't it, brother?

77
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:01,839
I was quite moved by her description
and I was wondering

78
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,008
if there was any chance
you might be willing to part with it.

79
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,901
Titus, didn't you bother
to look at the sheaves?

80
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:12,756
That planet is worth more
than all of your estates combined.

81
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:14,961
Really?

82
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:17,394
I had no idea.

83
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:23,808
- Kalique.
- Balem.

84
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:54,989
Jupiter, get up!

85
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:57,525
Get up!

86
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,170
Jupiter, make the coffee. Come on.

87
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:06,781
I hate my life.

88
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:22,140
Jupiter, hurry up!

89
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,361
That one goes next to that one.

90
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:27,818
Jupiter! Get the garbage after this.

91
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,920
- You finish the bathroom?
- No.

92
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:39,006
Jupiter!

93
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:41,998
I hate my life.

94
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:06,058
Damn it.

95
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:08,848
Told you.

96
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,375
Lycantant.

97
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:16,762
Another Hunter.

98
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:19,610
And ex-legion. He was a skyjacker.

99
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,975
- How do you know that?
- The boots.

100
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:44,216
There was a Hunter in the legion.
A legend.

101
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:47,488
Could track a single gene in the gyre.

102
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:51,672
No matter who or what he is...
he's after our bounty.

103
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:56,470
That's him. It's got to be.

104
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,674
We should warn Lord Balem.

105
00:11:58,774 --> 00:12:00,764
That is what we should do, but...

106
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:04,347
Do you trust me?

107
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:12,051
This matter must be handled
with delicacy, malidictes.

108
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:13,971
I understand, lady Kalique.

109
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:17,620
Neither Balem nor Titus
must suspect my involvement.

110
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,282
Of course, Your Majesty.

111
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:25,042
You believe The Hunters can be trusted?

112
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:29,451
Trust is an illusion, my lady.
I believe only in mutual self-interest.

113
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:33,058
They want another life. We can offer it.

114
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,846
Make the deal.

115
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:45,147
Welcome back, Lord Balem.

116
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:47,685
It has been too long.

117
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:52,511
I have not crossed the vastness
of space for your pleasantries, Mr. Night.

118
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:56,720
Of course, My Lord.
We have verified the geneprint.

119
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,241
Most unfortunate news.

120
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:04,351
I believe Titus is aware
of the recurrence.

121
00:14:04,665 --> 00:14:08,260
My spies whisper
but cannot substantiate.

122
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:12,016
So you have her print,
but you don't have her?

123
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:14,270
Mr. Tskalikan.

124
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,829
The keepers traced the print
to a medical clinic.

125
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:20,309
They're eliminating every lead.

126
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:25,375
We have a name. Dunlevy.
Katherine Dunlevy.

127
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,966
Well, I want miss Dunlevy found...

128
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:32,054
and I want her dead.

129
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:36,630
Black. Classic? A la mode, a la m... No.

130
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:38,500
Katherine, I'm done.

131
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,058
Jupiter! Help, please?

132
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,397
- Wow, what's the occasion?
- Austin Davis is taking me to dinner.

133
00:14:45,497 --> 00:14:48,687
- I think he's gonna ask me to marry him!
- Do you wanna marry him?

134
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,360
Jupiter, he's the number eight richest
bachelor under thirty in America.

135
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,231
He speaks fluent Chinese and German,

136
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:57,370
and he was an alternate
on the olympic curling team.

137
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,710
- Solid résumé.
- Yeah, I mean, it sounds totally...

138
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,029
- ...Cinderella, doesn't it?
- Sure.

139
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:06,262
Then why do I feel like
I'm about to throw up? Oh, God.

140
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,062
I just don't remember Cinderella puking.

141
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:12,950
Kind of remember her dancing
with a bunch of mice.

142
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:18,995
Have you ever...
fallen in love, Jupiter?

143
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:24,273
You know, my mom says that love
is just a fairytale for little girls.

144
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:29,134
That really, it's all just urges
and obligations.

145
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:31,295
Wow. That's kind of harsh.

146
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:33,841
- You want my advice?
- Yes.

147
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:35,710
If he's really in love with you,

148
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:39,584
then he'll understand
that you're just overwhelmed and...

149
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:41,087
and you need a little time.

150
00:15:41,188 --> 00:15:43,583
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

151
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:45,430
Okay, what do I wear now?

152
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,054
Something that reminds him
of what he is waiting for.

153
00:15:49,154 --> 00:15:53,678
Like that Red McQueen,
or this Little Ricci.

154
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,169
Katherine? Everything all right?

155
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,743
Yeah, no, no. We're good.
I'll be down in a sec.

156
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:46,898
Picked up a referral. A townhouse.
But it has to be Wednesday.

157
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:50,555
- Wednesday's full. Three houses.
- So do four.

158
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:55,114
English, please.
We use English in this house.

159
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:58,270
Use whatever you like.
You sound like Stalin to me.

160
00:16:58,371 --> 00:17:01,076
Stalin?! I'm Stalin?
You don't want the money.

161
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:03,513
I will give it to... Gleb's crew.

162
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:06,418
Good. Thank you.

163
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:09,292
- We'll take it.
- Big surprise.

164
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:11,829
Hey, cousin, speaking of money,
I was wondering if...

165
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:14,940
Oh, let me guess. Another advance.

166
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,359
For what this time? Shoes? A new phone?

167
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,348
I'll earn it back.

168
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:24,070
No, you mean you'll waste it
trying to make yourself feel better

169
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:25,860
by buying something you don't need.

170
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,666
So, what, instead of feeling better,
I should save my money and feel worse?

171
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:33,738
Exactly.
Now, you're a smart girl, Jupiter.

172
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,725
I admit it's none of my business,

173
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:37,729
but that's probably the reason
you are not married.

174
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:40,351
Men do not like smart women.

175
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:42,054
You keep talking about
my daughter like that,

176
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:45,767
I will ram that latke so far up your ass,
you won't crap for a week.

177
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:48,083
English.

178
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:52,008
Hey! Hey!

179
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:54,496
You swore, no fighting at dinner.

180
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:59,100
Jupiter, what is the money for?

181
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,547
No, you're right.

182
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:05,532
It's nothing I need.

183
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,610
Hey, what was that about? You're not
having second thoughts, are you?

184
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,047
What if I am?

185
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,886
Jupiter...

186
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:29,889
These people, they're counting on you.

187
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:32,034
Have you even looked at this thing?

188
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:36,079
Why do they have to use words
like "harvesting"? It's just creepy.

189
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,347
Why would you read this?
You heard what the doctor said.

190
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:43,507
It's not a big deal.
You go in, cash comes out.

191
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:48,700
This money, I'm telling you,
I have real plans, serious plans.

192
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,680
I believe this money's
gonna mean something...

193
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,352
possibly life-changing for both of us.

194
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:01,366
Okay.

195
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:05,098
Okay.

196
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:07,486
- You will not regret this.
- All right.

197
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:09,005
- I promise. I promise!
- All right, all right.

198
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:11,528
All right. Oh, wait, I have a question.

199
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:15,001
Why is it that you get ten grand and
I get five? I mean, they're not your eggs.

200
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:20,895
That's capitalism, babe.
Shit rolls downhill. Profits flow up.

201
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:55,270
Ms. Dunlevy? Excuse me.

202
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:57,575
You are Katherine Dunlevy, aren't you?

203
00:19:59,002 --> 00:20:00,321
The doctor's ready.

204
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:07,669
- It's the hormones, dear.
- Don't worry. You'll be fine.

205
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:11,317
Trust me, honey. I could do
this procedure with my eyes closed.

206
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,163
No, no, no, no, no!
Please! Please, I can't!

207
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:15,517
Just relax.

208
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:28,793
I can't move my arms! What's happening?

209
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:32,180
Get a sample.
Make sure this is the right one.

210
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,340
Wait, wait. Please, please, stop.

211
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:41,000
- It's her.
- Good. Kill her.

212
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,283
Please, somebody...

213
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:45,893
Oh, my God!

214
00:21:19,106 --> 00:21:21,194
You all right?

215
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:24,952
- Who are you?
- Caine Wise. I'm here to help you.

216
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:56,729
Pardon me, Lord Titus.

217
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:59,318
Only good news is allowed
in here, Famulus.

218
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:03,192
We received an FTL from Mr. Wise.
He says he has the girl.

219
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:05,346
Brilliant.

220
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:07,794
Then send the transport immediately.

221
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:10,218
At once, My Lord.

222
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:24,600
I thought it would make you
feel better when you woke up.

223
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,228
- What?
- The gun.

224
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:28,837
But it works better if you flip
the switch by your thumb.

225
00:22:30,962 --> 00:22:33,951
Careful. You've been asleep
for almost twelve hours.

226
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:37,942
- Where am I?
- You're still in Chicago.

227
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:40,280
Okay, good.

228
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:44,154
My clothes?

229
00:22:44,254 --> 00:22:46,575
You were still in the paper clinic gown.

230
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:49,481
Can't really think about that right now.

231
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:53,873
Look, Jupiter... Is that your name?

232
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,192
- How do you know?
- I'm sorry.

233
00:22:56,645 --> 00:22:58,582
I was just trying to figure out
what happened.

234
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:00,632
You must have used
a false name at the clinic

235
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:03,559
and their tests probably tripped
the monitor to your geneprint.

236
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,743
What are you saying?
I mean, yes, I used a false name, but...

237
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:11,006
lots of people do that in there. What does
that have to do with what happened to me?

238
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:15,281
Okay. When I was in the legion,
they gave me protocols for this.

239
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:21,859
It can be difficult for Terrsies,
or people from underdeveloped worlds,

240
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:25,768
to hear that their planet is not the only
inhabited planet in the verse.

241
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:29,608
It has to be the anesthesia.
I mean, it's gotta be a dream.

242
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:33,717
Protocol actually says that most Terrsies
will say that this has to be a dream.

243
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:36,906
Yeah, because a dream is the only way
any of this makes sense.

244
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:41,682
Compared to what? The idea
that you're the only intelligent species,

245
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:45,439
on the only inhabitable planet
in a universe so full of planets

246
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,512
that you don't even have a number
to describe how many there are?

247
00:23:48,712 --> 00:23:52,269
- Are you saying you're an alien?
- Genomgineered human.

248
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,310
They cut my DNA with the DNA
of something like a wolf.

249
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,181
I'm a Lycantant,
bred for the military, but...

250
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:00,185
that didn't work out for me.

251
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:04,303
- And those things at the clinic?
- Keepers.

252
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:07,142
They're from the Diorite system,
but they're genetically repurposed

253
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:10,403
to act as monitors and watchdogs.

254
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,714
And they're trying to kill me?

255
00:24:16,215 --> 00:24:18,553
- Yes.
- Why me?

256
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:21,143
Please. This has to be a mistake.

257
00:24:21,942 --> 00:24:25,343
These people don't make
those kind of mistakes.

258
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:29,207
What if I say no? What if...
I don't go with you? What if I go home?

259
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:34,415
What? Are they gonna come
after me again?

260
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:40,613
An FTL, My Lord.

261
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:45,939
There was a problem at the clinic.
A former legionnaire was involved.

262
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,493
A legionnaire?

263
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:50,365
- What about the girl?
- Still alive.

264
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:55,732
Double our security deployment.
Destroy any ship that comes near the planet.

265
00:24:57,478 --> 00:24:58,514
Go!

266
00:25:02,855 --> 00:25:04,175
Wow.

267
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:13,622
- Are those flying boots?
- They use the force of gravity,

268
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:16,969
redirecting it into deferential
equation slopes that you can surf.

269
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,242
Yeah. I heard "gravity" and "surf."

270
00:25:21,557 --> 00:25:24,313
Up is hard. Down is easy.

271
00:25:24,513 --> 00:25:26,263
Thank you. Wow.

272
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,576
Our ride's here. You ready?

273
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:32,712
Ready?

274
00:25:32,812 --> 00:25:36,269
Ready to walk out of a hundred-story window
with you and your gravity boots...

275
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,758
- ...onto an invisible spaceship to meet...
- This might make it easier.

276
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:40,427
Okay.

277
00:25:47,975 --> 00:25:50,135
Sorry.

278
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:14,707
Shit.

279
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:18,222
Hold tight!

280
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,809
Hold on!

281
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:35,118
Whatever you do, don't let go!

282
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:45,333
Look, I just need to know
what in the hell is going on here.

283
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:49,039
Think we might have stumbled into a war
within the Abrasax family.

284
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:50,308
The Abrasax family?

285
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,712
It's one of the most powerful
dynasties in the universe.

286
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:54,825
I don't care who they are.
You cannot just...

287
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:57,209
blow up a bunch of buildings
and get away with it.

288
00:31:57,309 --> 00:31:59,377
Those buildings
will be rebuilt by tonight.

289
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:01,580
That's impossible.

290
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,839
Take a look.

291
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,387
Holy crap.

292
00:32:11,716 --> 00:32:15,156
Wait, a bunch of people saw what happened.
I mean, they can't cover that up.

293
00:32:15,256 --> 00:32:18,731
You have a picture of a keeper on your phone
that you can't remember taking, can you?

294
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:21,970
They blanked you.

295
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,942
Short-term stuff is easy.
They won't get everybody,

296
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,464
but no one ever believes the ones
that slip through the cracks.

297
00:32:27,564 --> 00:32:29,890
Oh, my God.

298
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,605
Why is this happening to me?

299
00:32:32,866 --> 00:32:35,278
I asked Titus that question
before I took this job.

300
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:37,283
All he'd tell me
is that it was personal.

301
00:32:37,383 --> 00:32:41,791
Look, this is ridiculous. I have never
even met this Titus, what's his name?

302
00:32:41,891 --> 00:32:46,245
Abrasax. The house of Abrasax
has three primary heirs.

303
00:32:46,345 --> 00:32:49,255
The oldest is Balem.
He's the one that controls this planet

304
00:32:49,355 --> 00:32:51,493
and is obviously the one
who wants you dead.

305
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:54,432
That's insane.
I am telling you, I am nobody.

306
00:32:55,421 --> 00:32:58,991
Balem Abrasax wouldn't demolish
an entire city for a nobody.

307
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:02,014
Kill her.

308
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:05,860
Wait. Oh, my God! Stop!

309
00:33:25,843 --> 00:33:28,599
There you are.

310
00:33:32,968 --> 00:33:37,599
You know there are moments
when I actually miss you.

311
00:33:40,537 --> 00:33:44,797
But no one understands
this universe like you did.

312
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:49,681
No one understands me...

313
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:52,795
like you did.

314
00:34:07,806 --> 00:34:09,878
Mr. Tskalikan?

315
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:13,902
How is it possible for a single splice

316
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:17,109
to destroy an entire fleet of shadows?

317
00:34:17,509 --> 00:34:21,000
- It was a mistake.
- A mistake?

318
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,093
They underestimated him.

319
00:34:24,193 --> 00:34:27,261
The next mistake...

320
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:29,666
I hold you accountable.

321
00:34:37,197 --> 00:34:38,466
What are you doing?

322
00:34:38,566 --> 00:34:40,687
I just want the owner of this car
to know who borrowed it.

323
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:43,242
We needed a low profile
to get out of the city.

324
00:34:45,106 --> 00:34:47,517
Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

325
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:51,808
- Don't worry about it. It's fine.
- Lucky for you...

326
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,786
a woman owns this car.

327
00:34:57,353 --> 00:34:59,991
What is that? Is that a...

328
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:04,934
Just... I wanna thank you...
for saving my life. I mean, I've...

329
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:08,840
I've never been so scared
when I started falling...

330
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,938
Then you were there, and...

331
00:35:14,603 --> 00:35:16,313
Do you do this sort of thing a lot?

332
00:35:18,063 --> 00:35:19,221
No.

333
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,668
Then why did Titus hire you?

334
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:26,726
Titus hired me because I'm good
at finding people.

335
00:35:28,396 --> 00:35:31,604
Are you taking me to him now?

336
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,842
No.

337
00:35:43,992 --> 00:35:46,232
How do you know this guy?

338
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:49,854
A long time ago, he was a friend.

339
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:56,066
- What is he doing living way out here?
- He's a marshal for the Aegis.

340
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:59,741
- The Aegis?
- They're like cops.

341
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:03,549
Space cops. Sure.

342
00:36:16,238 --> 00:36:17,523
Stinger.

343
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:22,216
Back from the goddamn dead.

344
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,607
It's kind of funny, both of us
ending up on this planet.

345
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:29,074
Funny ain't the word I'd use.

346
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,251
- How'd you get out?
- Titus Abrasax. He hired me to lift her.

347
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,207
Since Deadland ain't taught you
a damn thing...

348
00:36:41,637 --> 00:36:43,725
Just as I was getting used to this life,

349
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:47,683
you come back reminding me
what I flushed down the shitter for you.

350
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:00,709
Where's Kiza? She used to at least listen
to my side of the story.

351
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:02,871
You stay the hell away from my daughter.

352
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:07,171
Don't drag me
into your male mating rituals.

353
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:12,647
- Hi. I'm Kiza.
- Hi.

354
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:14,407
Jupiter. Nice to meet you.

355
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,056
You used to have a little mettle
in you, kid.

356
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:20,295
- I guess I'm getting a little old.
- Old? Look at me.

357
00:37:20,395 --> 00:37:22,405
Not a recode
or a drop of juice in years.

358
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:24,687
You are a lot uglier than I remember.

359
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:30,992
Hey! Hey!

360
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:35,140
What is going on here?

361
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:01,146
Your Majesty.

362
00:38:14,215 --> 00:38:15,968
Your Majesty.

363
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:19,690
Thank you.

364
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:23,012
I'll go to town to pick up
some groceries for dinner.

365
00:38:23,112 --> 00:38:25,884
- I'll go.
- I'm fine, Dad.

366
00:38:29,145 --> 00:38:31,967
Okay. All right.

367
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:34,379
Let's have a look at you.

368
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:40,064
It's not pretty, is it?

369
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:43,000
Clipped and stripped. The mark
of a court martialed skyjacker.

370
00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:46,512
You still haven't answered my question.
Do you want your wings back or not?

371
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:48,216
Wait, you had wings?

372
00:38:48,516 --> 00:38:52,603
The best bio-neural-synaptic prosthetic
the military could buy.

373
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:06,926
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

374
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:11,401
Your Majesty has no idea of the scientific
miracles that human beings are capable of.

375
00:39:11,928 --> 00:39:15,176
Why won't those human beings
share things like this?

376
00:39:15,276 --> 00:39:19,293
Sharing has never been the strong suit
of your species, Your Majesty.

377
00:39:19,393 --> 00:39:22,632
Okay, what is with this
"Your Majesty" thing?

378
00:39:23,032 --> 00:39:25,371
You've never been stung
by a bee, have you?

379
00:39:25,471 --> 00:39:26,429
No.

380
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:31,382
You know, bees are genetically
designed to recognize royalty.

381
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:33,269
Royalty?

382
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:39,163
Well... You are in for a surprise
when you find out what I do for a living.

383
00:39:39,263 --> 00:39:44,384
Oh, it's not what you do.
It's what you are. They sense it.

384
00:39:44,484 --> 00:39:47,113
Bees aren't like humans.
They don't question or doubt.

385
00:39:47,713 --> 00:39:49,967
Bees don't lie.

386
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,955
Oh, I... Sorry, I gotta take this.

387
00:39:58,156 --> 00:40:01,790
I'm guessing Titus
didn't say anything about it.

388
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:05,499
No. Must have slipped his mind.

389
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,103
Not easy to picture you
making a deal with a royal.

390
00:40:09,136 --> 00:40:11,659
Titus told me you were posted
to this planet

391
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:15,684
and said if I helped him, he'd get you
your wings back, full reinstatement.

392
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:21,212
- I figured I owed you.
- Yeah, you do.

393
00:40:22,313 --> 00:40:25,295
But if she is a recurrence...

394
00:40:25,395 --> 00:40:27,942
then this is a hell of a lot more
important than wings.

395
00:40:30,446 --> 00:40:33,685
<i>It's life changing, Jupiter!
Wait till you see this thing.</i>

396
00:40:33,885 --> 00:40:38,871
Two million pixels of resolution.
Everything I ever wanted.

397
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:43,732
Yeah, no. That's great. Is mom there?

398
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:47,846
No. She went out with Nino. Listen,
they were a little freaked out last night

399
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:50,702
when you didn't come home,
but I covered. I think it's fine.

400
00:40:50,802 --> 00:40:52,623
How 'bout a little gratitude
for your cousin Vladie?

401
00:40:52,723 --> 00:40:56,462
I mean, this thing was a cakewalk,
right? Just like I said.

402
00:40:56,563 --> 00:40:59,995
- Easiest money we ever made. Cha-ching!
- It didn't happen.

403
00:41:00,968 --> 00:41:02,975
Didn't happen.

404
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,687
- What?
- <i>No, I know. I'm so sorry.</i>

405
00:41:08,787 --> 00:41:10,691
- Oh, no.
- <i>I'm really, really sorry.</i>

406
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:13,546
- <i>Why?</i>
- There was an accident at the clinic.

407
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,851
<i>Someone got hurt.</i>

408
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:19,032
Shit! I knew it!

409
00:41:19,132 --> 00:41:21,595
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I can't catch a break.

410
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:25,095
- <i>I cannot catch a single break!</i>
- Look, Vladie, I'm with some people.

411
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:27,089
- <i>I don't wanna be rude.</i>
- Wait, Jupiter, we have to reschedule.

412
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:30,361
Totally. So, just tell mom I'm okay
and I will call her when I can.

413
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:34,086
Wait, wait, wait! Jupe, Jupe...
I already spent the money.

414
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:37,133
You're in trouble.

415
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:39,328
You're in trouble.

416
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,418
Don't touch my stuff!

417
00:41:48,763 --> 00:41:52,379
Balem ordered a blockade.
Nothing is getting on or off this planet.

418
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:55,459
But Aegis command said
once her geneprint is verified,

419
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,648
they'll get an injunction
to take us to Orous.

420
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:00,178
- So we wait.
- They're sending a cruiser.

421
00:42:00,278 --> 00:42:01,795
- When?
- Should be here tomorrow.

422
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:05,465
- We won't last the night.
- We need a plan.

423
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,534
We need firepower.

424
00:42:07,634 --> 00:42:09,671
If she's what you say she is,

425
00:42:10,271 --> 00:42:12,359
we're not getting off this planet
without a fight.

426
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:14,763
Stash is in the back.

427
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,578
- Is he mad at me?
- When he's mad, you'll know it.

428
00:42:21,678 --> 00:42:23,648
He just...

429
00:42:23,748 --> 00:42:27,171
seems different since we got here.

430
00:42:31,045 --> 00:42:34,388
Caine is... complicated.

431
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:41,850
He's a Lycantant without a pack.

432
00:42:42,986 --> 00:42:47,936
Had the bad luck to be born
half-albino. Runt of the litter.

433
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:51,485
The splicer that bred him had to sell him
to the legion for a loss.

434
00:42:52,085 --> 00:42:55,325
But a Lycantant needs a pack.

435
00:42:55,626 --> 00:42:57,413
It's their center of gravity.

436
00:42:58,518 --> 00:43:02,950
Alone, usually they waste away and die,

437
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,911
unless they become like him.

438
00:43:05,312 --> 00:43:07,937
Fearless. Relentless.

439
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,199
Perfect hunting machines.

440
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:17,202
Caine was the best soldier
I ever went into battle with.

441
00:43:18,603 --> 00:43:20,591
Why did he get court martialed?

442
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:24,733
I'm sorry. If it's none of my business.
You don't have to tell me.

443
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:28,097
Oh, he attacked someone.
He attacked an entitled.

444
00:43:28,497 --> 00:43:31,989
- He bit him.
- He bit him?

445
00:43:33,271 --> 00:43:34,561
Tore his throat out.

446
00:43:36,956 --> 00:43:40,396
There's something about the royals
for Caine. It's instinctual.

447
00:43:41,998 --> 00:43:46,032
They tried to put him down, but he was
under my command so I took the blame.

448
00:43:47,538 --> 00:43:51,016
Two scars across my back as a reward.

449
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:23,496
You know, you both have marks on your neck,
but they're slightly different.

450
00:44:23,596 --> 00:44:26,211
The brand of the splicer.

451
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:30,209
Marcellian Cahun was her name.
She loved bees.

452
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:32,563
Wow.

453
00:44:33,063 --> 00:44:36,094
My father would be freaking out
right now.

454
00:44:36,194 --> 00:44:40,128
Do you know what this will do to people
when they find out the truth?

455
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,188
I don't think that most people
would want to know the truth.

456
00:44:45,488 --> 00:44:46,841
I do.

457
00:44:49,017 --> 00:44:49,946
Okay.

458
00:44:50,046 --> 00:44:55,012
So, you've been taught that the birthplace
of the human race is earth, but it's not.

459
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:59,125
It's actually a planet in the Cunabulum
system called Orous,

460
00:44:59,225 --> 00:45:02,070
a little over
a billion of your years ago.

461
00:45:02,171 --> 00:45:06,362
Your planet was discovered during what is
commonly called the great expansion.

462
00:45:10,068 --> 00:45:14,453
At the time, earth was inhabited
by a branch-species of Saurisapian,

463
00:45:14,853 --> 00:45:17,200
a dangerous human predator
called the Sargorn.

464
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,999
Obviously before any colonization

465
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:22,611
or resource development
could be done safely to your planet,

466
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:26,216
a large-scale extinction event
was manufactured...

467
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:28,104
Damn budget cuts.

468
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,288
Are you talking about dinosaurs?

469
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:37,623
Wait, are you saying your people
killed the dinosaurs?

470
00:45:37,823 --> 00:45:40,528
Technically,
they're your people, Majesty.

471
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,325
Come on.

472
00:46:04,824 --> 00:46:09,696
According to commonwealth records,
this planet was seeded by Abrasax industries

473
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:11,956
roughly one hundred thousand years ago.

474
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:16,941
Human DNA spliced with indigenous
species to evolve a fertile population.

475
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:20,405
And that's where the "why"
gets ugly. Basically,

476
00:46:20,505 --> 00:46:23,754
the goal is to grow a population
as large as possible.

477
00:46:23,854 --> 00:46:28,554
Once the population exceeds
the planet's ability to sustain it,

478
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:32,289
it's considered ripe for harvest.

479
00:46:33,095 --> 00:46:34,403
Harvest?

480
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:40,010
What's going on? What's wrong with them?

481
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,011
They're here.

482
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:43,040
- Go.
- Come on.

483
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,071
What? Caine? Wait, Caine!

484
00:46:47,195 --> 00:46:48,708
Caine!

485
00:47:25,647 --> 00:47:26,849
Beeswax.

486
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:30,509
Gotcha.

487
00:49:39,072 --> 00:49:41,159
Mr. Night,

488
00:49:41,259 --> 00:49:43,831
I want this facility
running at capacity.

489
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:47,971
I want full diagnostics and cost
projections for an early harvest.

490
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:49,242
Of course, My Lord.

491
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:51,914
What kind of grade
are we getting from the skim?

492
00:49:52,014 --> 00:49:53,818
Excellent product, sire.

493
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:56,012
Premium grade.

494
00:49:56,889 --> 00:50:00,564
It's a... particularly robust stock.

495
00:50:02,784 --> 00:50:06,341
Assuming market stability,
if we harvest later this century,

496
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:10,715
profit margins should eclipse
your nearest competitor.

497
00:50:12,736 --> 00:50:15,141
Understand this, Mr. Night.

498
00:50:15,964 --> 00:50:20,601
I will harvest that planet tomorrow

499
00:50:21,173 --> 00:50:24,231
before I let her take it from me.

500
00:50:28,284 --> 00:50:32,145
- Here we go.
- I trust you.

501
00:51:04,512 --> 00:51:07,426
Premium Abrasax, as requested.

502
00:51:16,894 --> 00:51:17,951
Now...

503
00:51:19,155 --> 00:51:22,071
Where is Her Majesty?

504
00:51:29,401 --> 00:51:31,423
<i>Good evening, Your Majesty.</i>

505
00:51:31,853 --> 00:51:34,946
<i>Allow me to assist.</i>

506
00:51:35,798 --> 00:51:38,402
<i>I am Sendi, your chamber presence.</i>

507
00:51:38,502 --> 00:51:41,858
- New clothes?
- <i>We wish only to attend your needs.</i>

508
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:43,357
Where am I?

509
00:51:43,457 --> 00:51:46,601
<i>This is the Alcazar of Kalique Abrasax,</i>

510
00:51:46,701 --> 00:51:49,440
<i>second primary of the house of Abrasax.</i>

511
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:54,039
- What's an Alcazar?
- A fancy way of saying my home.

512
00:51:54,733 --> 00:51:55,936
I'm Kalique.

513
00:51:57,097 --> 00:51:58,641
Jupiter Jones.

514
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:03,952
I'm sorry for staring,
but it's really quite astonishing.

515
00:52:04,953 --> 00:52:06,323
What is?

516
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:10,298
It will be easier to show you.

517
00:52:16,643 --> 00:52:18,997
Could this get any weirder?

518
00:52:19,998 --> 00:52:24,358
Imagine it for me. Meeting your mother
long after she's passed away.

519
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,044
But I'm not your mother.

520
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:31,322
Your planet is just now entering
its genetic age.

521
00:52:31,422 --> 00:52:36,181
You understand very little about something
which is a vital part of our reality.

522
00:52:37,432 --> 00:52:41,691
In our world, genes have
an almost spiritual significance.

523
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,979
They are the seeds of our immortality.

524
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:49,840
When the exact same genes
reappear in the exact same order,

525
00:52:50,355 --> 00:52:52,729
it is for us what
you would call reincarnation.

526
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:55,274
But how could I be a reincarnation
of your mother

527
00:52:55,374 --> 00:52:56,946
unless your mother was from earth?

528
00:52:57,046 --> 00:52:59,442
My mother was born
before your first cities were built.

529
00:53:02,102 --> 00:53:05,177
Are you some kind of vampire race?

530
00:53:07,357 --> 00:53:09,378
We are the cause
of a lot of those myths,

531
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:12,467
but I promise my mother
was just as human as you or I.

532
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:15,974
The difference between us
is our knowledge and technology.

533
00:53:17,051 --> 00:53:19,547
How old do you think I am?

534
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,668
Late forties?

535
00:53:22,317 --> 00:53:24,807
I recently celebrated
my fourteenth millennium.

536
00:53:26,043 --> 00:53:28,648
You're fourteen thousand years old?

537
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:31,671
Fourteen thousand and four,
to be precise.

538
00:53:32,302 --> 00:53:36,363
My mother was approaching her ninety-first
millennium when she passed.

539
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,791
You'd be just as amazed
how quickly it goes.

540
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:46,416
If your lives are so long, could I ask you
how your mother actually died?

541
00:53:48,162 --> 00:53:49,831
She was murdered.

542
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,694
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

543
00:53:53,695 --> 00:53:56,769
- Did they ever find out who did it?
- No.

544
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:00,306
My mother and I
did not always get along.

545
00:54:00,406 --> 00:54:04,996
But I have a hope that this recurrence
might mean a second chance for both of us.

546
00:54:05,348 --> 00:54:09,735
Come. Let me introduce you
to the possibilities of your new life.

547
00:55:13,366 --> 00:55:14,564
Holy crap.

548
00:55:17,307 --> 00:55:20,574
Each of us has a code
for our optimal physical condition.

549
00:55:20,674 --> 00:55:24,839
The problem is our genes have an expiration
date which is transferred to our cells.

550
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,993
A long time ago, someone figured out

551
00:55:27,093 --> 00:55:29,549
how to replace deteriorating
cells with new ones.

552
00:55:29,749 --> 00:55:32,120
Today, it's as easy
as changing a light bulb.

553
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,877
- Where do you get these light bulbs?
- You grow them.

554
00:55:36,178 --> 00:55:41,053
- Like clones?
- No. Clones lack genetic plasticity.

555
00:55:41,153 --> 00:55:43,459
Several million years ago,
a gene plague caused by cloning

556
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:46,314
nearly annihilated
the entire human race.

557
00:55:47,215 --> 00:55:50,856
I was told that the house
of Abrasax seeded the earth.

558
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:52,926
Is that where you get it?

559
00:55:54,473 --> 00:55:59,062
Your earth is a very small part
of a very large industry.

560
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,906
Feel my skin.

561
00:56:03,915 --> 00:56:05,418
Oh, wow.

562
00:56:05,618 --> 00:56:09,145
In your world, people are used
to fighting for resources,

563
00:56:09,246 --> 00:56:11,996
like oil, or minerals, or land.

564
00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:14,435
But when you have access
to the vastness of space,

565
00:56:14,536 --> 00:56:18,379
you realize there's only
one resource worth fighting over...

566
00:56:18,479 --> 00:56:21,056
even killing for...

567
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:22,500
more time.

568
00:56:25,188 --> 00:56:29,280
Time is the single most precious
commodity in the universe.

569
00:56:34,027 --> 00:56:35,394
<i>Unidentified Lycantant.</i>

570
00:56:51,873 --> 00:56:55,714
So, sorry, I just don't understand what
you mean when you say, "claim your title."

571
00:56:56,114 --> 00:56:58,169
Well, it's common for people
in the first estate

572
00:56:58,269 --> 00:57:00,708
to leave a trust
for any potential recurrence.

573
00:57:01,716 --> 00:57:04,465
My mother wrote her future self
into her will.

574
00:57:05,266 --> 00:57:08,676
Right now, Balem owns the title
to earth, but...

575
00:57:08,776 --> 00:57:12,481
Once you claim it,
the earth will belong to you.

576
00:57:12,981 --> 00:57:16,301
How can one person own the earth?

577
00:57:16,401 --> 00:57:19,143
It's just a planet, Jupiter.

578
00:57:19,243 --> 00:57:22,483
In this world, people own things
far more valuable.

579
00:57:23,184 --> 00:57:24,535
You cannot know right now

580
00:57:24,635 --> 00:57:27,677
what it will be like when you're offered
wealth beyond your imagining.

581
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:31,249
When you can choose
to remain young and beautiful,

582
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:34,773
or when you can have the power to change
the lives of your family for the better.

583
00:57:34,873 --> 00:57:37,813
And all you have to do
is close your eyes.

584
00:57:52,441 --> 00:57:53,960
Caine?

585
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:57,902
This must be The Hunter Titus hired.
Well-made, by the look of him.

586
00:57:58,002 --> 00:58:01,525
Whoa, no, no, no, no! Hey, hey!
It's okay. She's on our side.

587
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:03,379
Abrasax don't know any side
but their own.

588
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:06,668
Precisely.
And since Jupiter is an Abrasax,

589
00:58:06,768 --> 00:58:08,456
you can understand why
I helped her get off that planet.

590
00:58:08,556 --> 00:58:12,540
He has contacted the Aegis.
They are entering orbit now.

591
00:58:13,878 --> 00:58:15,903
Excellent.

592
00:58:16,003 --> 00:58:18,429
I had planned to take you myself, but...

593
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:22,114
the Aegis will undoubtedly
insist they handle things from here.

594
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,576
I wish for you the life
you've always dreamed of.

595
00:58:33,954 --> 00:58:36,493
Welcome aboard, Your Majesty.
My name is Diomika Tsing.

596
00:58:36,593 --> 00:58:39,154
- I'm the captain of this Aegis cruiser.
- Please, call me Jupe.

597
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:40,969
Your Majesty.

598
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:43,657
Stinger! You're all right!

599
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:47,152
For the time being, Your Majesty.
The time being.

600
00:58:47,252 --> 00:58:49,435
We'll be escorting you to the commonwealth
ministry on Orous.

601
00:58:49,535 --> 00:58:52,056
If there's anything we can do to make
the journey easier, you let us know.

602
00:58:52,357 --> 00:58:54,279
Actually, you know what?
I'm feeling a little overdressed,

603
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,634
so if you maybe have something
that I could change into?

604
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:02,342
By myself. While I'm awake.

605
00:59:02,442 --> 00:59:03,478
What?

606
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:11,259
No, no! Lord Balem!

607
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:12,896
It was The Hunters!

608
00:59:12,996 --> 00:59:18,123
They betrayed you in the name
of your sister! Please!

609
00:59:18,223 --> 00:59:21,330
Mercy, My Lord! Mercy!

610
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,276
Mr. Greeghan.

611
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,132
Bring her to me.

612
00:59:31,832 --> 00:59:34,461
Yes, My Lord.

613
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:40,415
Come in! I don't really...

614
00:59:40,516 --> 00:59:43,071
Oh, I don't really know how
to work this thing.

615
00:59:43,171 --> 00:59:46,449
Oh, hi. Come in.

616
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,504
Your Majesty might want
to take a few of these.

617
00:59:48,604 --> 00:59:50,769
Portaling can be a little rough
on the royal bowels.

618
00:59:50,919 --> 00:59:54,076
Oh. Well, my bowels
are anything but royal.

619
00:59:57,428 --> 00:59:59,302
Thank you.

620
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,959
You heard the lady down there.
You're an Abrasax now.

621
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,596
No, no, I am a Jones.

622
01:00:04,696 --> 01:00:08,421
Well, except when I'm mad,
then I'm a Bolotnikov.

623
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,748
If that's all you were,
you would not be on an Aegis cruiser

624
01:00:10,848 --> 01:00:12,566
headed to the hall of titles.

625
01:00:15,049 --> 01:00:16,937
Yeah.

626
01:00:17,037 --> 01:00:19,775
Stinger said that you attacked
an entitled once.

627
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,882
- Stinger talks too much.
- Is it true?

628
01:00:23,982 --> 01:00:26,013
Does it matter?

629
01:00:27,852 --> 01:00:32,779
Sorry, I get it's none of my business.
I was just trying to understand.

630
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:37,693
Look, the truth is...
I don't know why I did it. I...

631
01:00:37,793 --> 01:00:40,599
I don't even remember doing it.
It just happened.

632
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,792
We all do things we can't explain.

633
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:49,598
They said it was... in my genes. A...

634
01:00:49,698 --> 01:00:52,662
defect of my genomgineering.

635
01:00:53,106 --> 01:00:56,140
Could explain a lot of things about me.

636
01:00:57,086 --> 01:01:00,939
Like the fact that I have
an uncanny ability

637
01:01:01,139 --> 01:01:04,112
to fall for men that don't fall for me.

638
01:01:05,012 --> 01:01:09,221
It's like my internal compass needle
points straight at Mr. Wrong.

639
01:01:09,722 --> 01:01:12,765
Maybe it's my genes.

640
01:01:13,621 --> 01:01:16,718
Maybe I have defective engineering too.

641
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:20,075
And if that's the case...

642
01:01:20,175 --> 01:01:22,647
is there any way to fix it?

643
01:01:24,408 --> 01:01:27,138
You are royalty now.

644
01:01:27,739 --> 01:01:31,263
I'm a splice. You don't understand
what that means, but...

645
01:01:31,463 --> 01:01:34,619
I have more in common with a dog
than I have with you.

646
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:38,576
I love dogs, I've always loved dogs.

647
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:43,120
- I should go, Your Majesty.
- Right.

648
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:47,028
- You need to strap in before we portal.
- Right, okay.

649
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:51,368
"I love dogs?"

650
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:28,662
Welcome, Your Majesty,

651
01:02:28,762 --> 01:02:32,915
to the overpopulated, oozing cesspool
we humbly call "home."

652
01:02:44,271 --> 01:02:48,279
I did three tours in Abukesh, a battle
that cost the lives of two million soldiers,

653
01:02:48,379 --> 01:02:51,418
and I'd rather be back there than have
to deal with these bureaucrats.

654
01:02:52,118 --> 01:02:55,659
Greetings, Your Majesty.
I am intergalactic advocate Bob,

655
01:02:55,759 --> 01:02:58,888
here to assist you
through the ascension process.

656
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:07,919
Sheave.

657
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:14,813
This is the authentic recurrence
of her ladyship the Abrasax sovereign,

658
01:03:14,913 --> 01:03:17,368
and we have come to claim her title.

659
01:03:18,569 --> 01:03:20,924
You need to file
an inheritance petition,

660
01:03:21,024 --> 01:03:24,315
and if the title is held,
you'll need a transfer of title.

661
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:26,774
Thank you.

662
01:03:28,924 --> 01:03:33,446
File a quit claim through central services,
section nine-eighteen. Next.

663
01:03:33,546 --> 01:03:38,158
You need a title survey and geneprint
identification from wills and trusts.

664
01:03:45,673 --> 01:03:50,366
Yeah, I can't touch this without
a tax number from the revenue review.

665
01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:04,358
This is revenue request,
not revenue review.

666
01:04:12,374 --> 01:04:15,197
We can't get the title
without the tax I.D.

667
01:04:32,763 --> 01:04:37,406
It goes without saying that graft
is incompatible with my programming.

668
01:04:39,711 --> 01:04:41,633
I think you dropped something.

669
01:04:43,851 --> 01:04:46,890
Press your thumb in the depression.

670
01:04:53,536 --> 01:04:57,193
Seals and signets
are on sub-thirty-three.

671
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,515
Your Majesty.

672
01:05:09,267 --> 01:05:11,992
Well, well, well, well.

673
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,239
This is what I have to deal with.

674
01:05:40,577 --> 01:05:43,175
Oh, yeah.

675
01:05:49,595 --> 01:05:51,498
Yeah, very nice.

676
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,105
Would Your Majesty kindly
place your wrist here?

677
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:56,909
Yes.

678
01:05:57,009 --> 01:05:59,765
- Palm up, please.
- Sorry.

679
01:05:59,865 --> 01:06:02,396
Thank you. Thank you.

680
01:06:07,118 --> 01:06:09,125
Very good.

681
01:06:09,225 --> 01:06:11,059
Yes!

682
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,724
Okay.

683
01:06:15,745 --> 01:06:19,553
- It's cool.
- Very nice. Very, very nice indeed.

684
01:06:19,653 --> 01:06:24,797
Now, here is your code and conduct guide

685
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:29,104
and your royal ways
and means commission.

686
01:06:29,572 --> 01:06:34,598
And file this with a legion administrator
for your royal guard appointment.

687
01:06:34,698 --> 01:06:36,168
- Yes?
- Okay.

688
01:06:36,468 --> 01:06:40,263
Well, congratulations, Your Majesty...

689
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:43,116
And my deepest condolences.

690
01:06:46,722 --> 01:06:47,908
Thank you?

691
01:06:49,728 --> 01:06:54,236
I will never complain
about the DMV... ever again.

692
01:06:54,336 --> 01:06:58,211
Well, you did it. It's official.
You are now entitled.

693
01:06:58,911 --> 01:07:03,632
Entitled to what?
Like, free parking? Key to the city?

694
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:06,543
I mean, what does it even really mean?

695
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:10,535
It means Your Majesty's life
is gonna change... if she wants it to.

696
01:07:12,038 --> 01:07:14,508
Can you say that again?

697
01:07:14,624 --> 01:07:17,714
Just the "Your Majesty" part.

698
01:07:18,445 --> 01:07:19,736
Your Majesty.

699
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:23,059
That's interesting.

700
01:07:23,659 --> 01:07:27,967
When other people say it,
it makes me really uncomfortable.

701
01:07:28,068 --> 01:07:30,072
But when you say it...

702
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:31,843
I don't know.

703
01:07:33,998 --> 01:07:36,769
I will admit there are things
about my life that I would like to change,

704
01:07:36,869 --> 01:07:39,004
but that doesn't make me
a different person. It doesn't...

705
01:07:40,693 --> 01:07:44,668
it doesn't change the things
that matter to me, or who I care about.

706
01:07:47,584 --> 01:07:49,071
I'm still the same me.

707
01:07:49,881 --> 01:07:52,615
If Your Majesty says so.

708
01:07:54,488 --> 01:07:57,058
Well, you're the one
with the entitled instinct.

709
01:07:57,458 --> 01:08:01,333
Is there something
happening to you right now?

710
01:08:01,433 --> 01:08:05,594
Does any part of you wanna bite me?

711
01:08:07,614 --> 01:08:08,659
No.

712
01:08:10,684 --> 01:08:13,005
Well, maybe.

713
01:08:18,168 --> 01:08:19,496
Go ahead.

714
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:24,227
How can Your Majesty be so sure...

715
01:08:24,327 --> 01:08:28,769
if, as you've said,
your "compass is broken"?

716
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:32,320
Tell me that I'm wrong.

717
01:08:32,421 --> 01:08:35,865
You used to work for Titus,
but that's not true anymore.

718
01:08:35,965 --> 01:08:38,939
So, why stick around?

719
01:08:39,239 --> 01:08:41,540
Why help me?

720
01:08:46,367 --> 01:08:49,001
Because of Stinger.

721
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:53,701
He thinks if we help you, then you might
help us get back in the legion.

722
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:58,393
- I see.
- Good to know we're both liars.

723
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,209
What is this?

724
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,170
Sorry.

725
01:09:03,052 --> 01:09:04,715
Hello, Mr. Wise.

726
01:09:07,245 --> 01:09:10,398
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

727
01:09:16,715 --> 01:09:17,891
I'm sorry, man.

728
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:02,216
Welcome, Your Majesty.

729
01:10:02,316 --> 01:10:04,988
I am Titus Abrasax,

730
01:10:05,088 --> 01:10:07,827
third primary of the house of Abrasax,

731
01:10:07,927 --> 01:10:12,000
and it is my profound honor...

732
01:10:12,939 --> 01:10:14,139
to meet you.

733
01:10:15,936 --> 01:10:18,475
You are aware that by detaining me
without consent,

734
01:10:18,576 --> 01:10:21,888
you are in direct violation
of statute twenty-seven-b-stroke-six.

735
01:10:22,688 --> 01:10:26,409
Your Highness is a quick study
of the entitled code, I see.

736
01:10:26,509 --> 01:10:28,958
I also know that I can file
a tax grievance against you

737
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,606
unless you take me directly
where I want to go.

738
01:10:31,706 --> 01:10:34,478
I'd be delighted to take you
wherever you'd like.

739
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:38,393
I'd like to go home.

740
01:10:39,919 --> 01:10:41,442
Very well.

741
01:10:41,772 --> 01:10:44,165
- Set a course for earth.
- At once, My Lord.

742
01:10:46,568 --> 01:10:49,594
In the meantime,
since you've invoked code and conduct,

743
01:10:49,695 --> 01:10:52,470
I trust you'll do me the honor
of dining with me this evening.

744
01:10:54,209 --> 01:10:55,292
Very well.

745
01:11:01,346 --> 01:11:03,269
The Aegis is involved now,

746
01:11:03,369 --> 01:11:05,790
more than likely
tracking you as we speak.

747
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:08,628
- We've committed no crime.
- How 'bout detaining a royal?

748
01:11:09,761 --> 01:11:13,220
Her Majesty is... hardly detained.

749
01:11:13,521 --> 01:11:14,556
Where is she?

750
01:11:15,503 --> 01:11:17,943
Dining with Lord Titus, of course.

751
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:31,152
Unless they've moved on to dessert.

752
01:11:38,684 --> 01:11:42,106
Your Highness looks ravishing.

753
01:11:42,207 --> 01:11:44,596
What have you done with Caine?

754
01:11:44,696 --> 01:11:48,371
I know you do not trust me right now,
but I promise I am not your enemy.

755
01:11:51,502 --> 01:11:52,871
Please.

756
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:02,835
Mr. Wise and I had an arrangement.
He broke our contract.

757
01:12:02,935 --> 01:12:05,170
For that, I promised
to return him to the Deadland.

758
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:08,744
Is that open to negotiation?

759
01:12:09,345 --> 01:12:12,386
Everything is open to negotiation.

760
01:12:30,252 --> 01:12:33,141
I confess I feel I have you
at somewhat of a disadvantage.

761
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:35,937
Is it because you kidnapped me?

762
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,001
From the moment I saw your geneprint,

763
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:41,999
I knew so many things about you
because I was very close to my mother.

764
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:45,765
So close, in fact, that I could tell
by the way she raised her eyebrows

765
01:12:45,865 --> 01:12:48,498
exactly what she was thinking.

766
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:52,745
At this point, I probably know more
about you than you know yourself.

767
01:12:53,446 --> 01:12:55,535
Well, shoot.

768
01:12:55,898 --> 01:12:59,484
Just like her, always expecting
the worst from people.

769
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:02,247
Funny how often people exceed
those expectations.

770
01:13:02,347 --> 01:13:06,555
That distrust in others,
in the world and even in yourself,

771
01:13:06,655 --> 01:13:10,540
has made it difficult for you
to fall in love. Until now.

772
01:13:11,448 --> 01:13:14,855
You're in love
with Mr. Wise, aren't you?

773
01:13:14,955 --> 01:13:18,631
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but this isn't love.

774
01:13:18,732 --> 01:13:22,360
All Mr. Wise wants from me
is to make him a legionnaire again.

775
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:25,526
Mother was also a terrible liar.

776
01:13:25,826 --> 01:13:28,549
Your sister did tell me that you
would do anything in your power

777
01:13:28,649 --> 01:13:30,302
to prevent me from claiming my title.

778
01:13:30,402 --> 01:13:31,871
What makes you think Kalique
told you the truth?

779
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:34,518
- Why would she lie?
- Kalique is in competition with Balem.

780
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:36,510
She knows that the loss of the earth
will reduce his yield

781
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:39,166
and impact his position in the market.
His loss is her gain.

782
01:13:39,266 --> 01:13:41,756
Same can be said for you.

783
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:47,084
Not long ago, yes.

784
01:13:47,885 --> 01:13:50,273
- I would have been just like them.
- And now?

785
01:13:51,668 --> 01:13:55,300
I knew this moment would come
when your geneprint was first confirmed.

786
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,288
I knew that when it did,
I was going to ask you one question,

787
01:13:58,388 --> 01:14:03,265
and if you gave me the right answer,
I was going to change my life, irrevocably.

788
01:14:07,106 --> 01:14:08,361
Come with me.

789
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:18,355
What is that?

790
01:14:18,779 --> 01:14:22,903
It has many names.
Regenx, recell, nectar.

791
01:14:23,204 --> 01:14:25,425
There are various levels
of usefulness and quality,

792
01:14:25,525 --> 01:14:29,201
but this is the most pure
and most valuable solution

793
01:14:29,301 --> 01:14:31,368
made by the house of Abrasax.

794
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:33,672
Kalique came out of a bath.

795
01:14:33,772 --> 01:14:38,499
Naturally, my sister didn't explain
what it is or where it comes from.

796
01:14:39,301 --> 01:14:41,888
It comes from people.

797
01:14:42,132 --> 01:14:46,164
Each unit is refined from approximately
a hundred human beings.

798
01:14:46,264 --> 01:14:47,216
What?

799
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,678
Your planet is a farm, Jupiter.

800
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:53,952
There are thousands of planets like yours
set up by families like mine

801
01:14:54,052 --> 01:14:57,971
to supply an ever increasing
demand for more time.

802
01:15:00,373 --> 01:15:03,114
Are you saying you killed
a hundred people to make this?

803
01:15:03,214 --> 01:15:05,359
Not me, but...

804
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:09,073
yes, someone did.

805
01:15:09,448 --> 01:15:12,064
Not unlike butchering a herd of cattle.

806
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:19,512
- Oh, my God.
- It's all right. It's all right.

807
01:15:20,013 --> 01:15:22,956
My mother went through a profound
change at the end of her life.

808
01:15:23,056 --> 01:15:25,407
She felt exactly as you do now.

809
01:15:25,507 --> 01:15:28,972
But when she tried to do something
to stop this business, she was murdered.

810
01:15:29,072 --> 01:15:31,004
I believe the same thing
is about to happen to me

811
01:15:31,104 --> 01:15:33,305
because I began to carry out
the work she started.

812
01:15:34,377 --> 01:15:36,865
That is why I hired Mr. Wise
to find you.

813
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,118
I needed someone I could trust.

814
01:15:41,111 --> 01:15:43,491
I cannot allow my brother or sister
to end up with control

815
01:15:43,592 --> 01:15:46,672
over my part of the Abrasax inheritance.

816
01:15:46,773 --> 01:15:51,936
I want to know that when I die...
you will be my heir.

817
01:15:53,235 --> 01:15:55,801
Which brings us at last to my question.

818
01:15:59,084 --> 01:16:01,221
Jupiter Jones...

819
01:16:03,697 --> 01:16:05,204
will you marry me?

820
01:16:18,008 --> 01:16:19,805
A pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Apini.

821
01:16:19,905 --> 01:16:23,261
<i>I told your men not to take Caine.
You should have left him on Orous.</i>

822
01:16:23,661 --> 01:16:26,907
Unfortunately, My Lord promised
Mr. Wise that if he betrayed us

823
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,106
he'd be fed to the void.

824
01:16:29,206 --> 01:16:31,647
Titus Abrasax is a man of his word.

825
01:16:34,607 --> 01:16:37,646
- So was I.
- We got the trace.

826
01:16:38,547 --> 01:16:42,421
- Outside the Cleopeides.
- Better get a move on.

827
01:16:42,522 --> 01:16:44,935
Don't sound like Caine's
got a lot of time.

828
01:16:45,035 --> 01:16:46,476
Put him back in the brig.

829
01:16:57,584 --> 01:16:59,602
Lord Titus will see you now.

830
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:07,083
You should have told me the truth
about why you wanted her.

831
01:17:07,184 --> 01:17:09,073
What good would that have done?

832
01:17:09,173 --> 01:17:13,705
If I did, then Jupiter would be dead
and Balem would still own the earth.

833
01:17:13,805 --> 01:17:15,837
Lies are a necessity.

834
01:17:16,037 --> 01:17:19,593
They are the source of meaning,

835
01:17:19,693 --> 01:17:22,876
of belief and hope.

836
01:17:23,877 --> 01:17:28,311
Honestly, lies are sometimes
the only reason I get out of bed.

837
01:17:39,448 --> 01:17:42,154
I'm particularly fond
of the lies we tell ourselves.

838
01:17:42,254 --> 01:17:43,848
Like the lie you are now concocting

839
01:17:43,948 --> 01:17:47,464
that somehow you'll survive
being tossed into the void

840
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:49,900
and find some way to rescue Ms. Jones.

841
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,709
You can't kill her. The title
will just remain with her family.

842
01:17:53,809 --> 01:17:56,915
Well, not once Her Majesty
and I are married.

843
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:51,104
<i>Emergency pressurization complete.</i>

844
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:01,106
<i>You have thirty-seven minutes
of air remaining.</i>

845
01:19:03,009 --> 01:19:06,950
<i>Please get to an airlock
or life pod immediately.</i>

846
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:12,336
- You did what?! Shame on you!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

847
01:19:12,436 --> 01:19:18,357
You're telling me you convinced
your cousin to sell her eggs? Yeah?

848
01:19:18,507 --> 01:19:21,279
What the hell do you think she is,
a goddamn chicken?

849
01:19:21,379 --> 01:19:23,637
- Vassily, that's enough!
- Dad, Dad! She wanted to do it!

850
01:19:23,737 --> 01:19:26,577
She wanted to do it.
It wasn't all my plan!

851
01:19:26,677 --> 01:19:28,643
- You little shit, Vladie!
- She begged me.

852
01:19:28,744 --> 01:19:31,795
She wanted to buy some stupid telescope.
The deal wasn't even very good for me.

853
01:19:31,895 --> 01:19:35,055
- Telescope?
- It's a curse. Our family is cursed.

854
01:19:35,156 --> 01:19:39,364
I don't care what she wanted!
You don't treat your cousin like chicken!

855
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:19,026
You're the mother.

856
01:20:20,748 --> 01:20:25,278
Be gentle with this one.

857
01:20:27,221 --> 01:20:29,622
<i>You have zero minutes of air remaining.</i>

858
01:20:29,722 --> 01:20:32,747
<i>Carbon dioxide levels at maximum.</i>

859
01:20:32,847 --> 01:20:36,901
<i>Please get to an airlock
or life pod immediately.</i>

860
01:20:47,471 --> 01:20:49,844
- Is he alive?
- A few ticks later and he wouldn't be.

861
01:20:49,944 --> 01:20:52,589
He's gonna kill her.
He's gonna kill her!

862
01:20:58,549 --> 01:20:59,685
Is there a problem?

863
01:20:59,785 --> 01:21:02,674
No, I'm so sorry,
I don't think I can do this.

864
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:05,864
I told you not to think about it
like a wedding on your world.

865
01:21:05,964 --> 01:21:09,287
It's just a contract
in order to protect people.

866
01:21:09,387 --> 01:21:10,726
- Innocent people.
- I know, I get that, I do.

867
01:21:10,826 --> 01:21:13,662
I wish I could show you
the four small planets I inherited.

868
01:21:13,762 --> 01:21:17,837
Nothing as large as your earth, but each
unique and beautiful in its own way.

869
01:21:17,937 --> 01:21:20,151
I'd love to see them one day, but...

870
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:24,335
Right now, I need to speak to Caine.

871
01:21:24,435 --> 01:21:25,964
I see.

872
01:21:26,064 --> 01:21:29,614
You still don't trust me.
Even though you trust the man I hired.

873
01:21:31,179 --> 01:21:35,304
I'm sorry, but talking to Mr. Wise
is no longer possible.

874
01:21:35,404 --> 01:21:36,423
Why?

875
01:21:36,523 --> 01:21:39,512
He attacked a servitant
and destroyed a host of guards.

876
01:21:39,613 --> 01:21:42,802
Given his history, I was advised
to return him to the authorities.

877
01:21:42,902 --> 01:21:45,287
You do know what he did, don't you?

878
01:21:46,924 --> 01:21:48,633
And you still trust him.

879
01:21:49,481 --> 01:21:51,969
Beauty and her beast.

880
01:21:52,069 --> 01:21:54,849
Why wouldn't you tell me sooner?

881
01:21:55,794 --> 01:21:57,596
So you can plead for this.

882
01:21:57,696 --> 01:21:59,667
The original rite of pardon
and reinstatement

883
01:21:59,767 --> 01:22:01,997
my lawyers procured for him
and Mr. Apini.

884
01:22:02,098 --> 01:22:06,221
I kept it, knowing how you felt,
even if you wouldn't admit it.

885
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:12,342
To be fair, there was a time when I would
have used something like this against you.

886
01:22:13,343 --> 01:22:15,385
But now if you can believe
anything, Jupiter,

887
01:22:15,485 --> 01:22:18,347
you can believe that the life
of one splice matters very little to me

888
01:22:18,447 --> 01:22:21,492
compared to the lives of my subjects.

889
01:22:27,989 --> 01:22:29,684
Goodbye, Miss Jones.

890
01:22:32,764 --> 01:22:34,586
Titus.

891
01:22:38,308 --> 01:22:39,549
I'll do it.

892
01:22:41,129 --> 01:22:43,384
Thank you.

893
01:22:51,165 --> 01:22:52,720
I need your help.

894
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:55,709
Sure you want to go into a fight
with someone you can't trust?

895
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:58,465
Has anyone in your crew ever
broke through a field of warhammers?

896
01:23:01,103 --> 01:23:03,108
What happened?

897
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:08,358
Kiza's got the bug.
Couldn't afford the recode.

898
01:23:08,724 --> 01:23:10,778
I love my daughter, Caine.

899
01:23:10,878 --> 01:23:13,962
She's the only good thing
I've done with this life.

900
01:23:15,762 --> 01:23:18,487
You would have done the same.

901
01:23:18,787 --> 01:23:20,841
Are there any other family issues
that I should know about?

902
01:23:20,941 --> 01:23:23,396
- No.
- Loans?

903
01:23:23,597 --> 01:23:25,666
Money problems?

904
01:23:26,128 --> 01:23:29,306
- No.
- He's good. Let's go.

905
01:23:55,557 --> 01:23:56,602
Holy crap.

906
01:24:01,778 --> 01:24:05,512
Portal at mass. Nine ticks to intercept.

907
01:24:30,559 --> 01:24:33,766
<i>Abrasax clipper D-gamma-nine,
this is the Aegis.</i>

908
01:24:33,866 --> 01:24:36,751
<i>Cut your engines
and prepare to be boarded.</i>

909
01:24:44,762 --> 01:24:48,489
The Aegis are demanding to board, sire.

910
01:24:49,988 --> 01:24:53,394
Do what you must,
but keep them off this ship.

911
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:00,087
Warhammers are launching.

912
01:25:11,421 --> 01:25:12,537
Here we go.

913
01:25:17,015 --> 01:25:19,152
Your Highness.

914
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:22,476
- Who are all these people?
- Just Sims.

915
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:24,981
A necessary feature
for all royal weddings.

916
01:25:25,081 --> 01:25:30,325
As I told you, these are matters of state,
not of the heart. Shall we begin?

917
01:25:40,577 --> 01:25:41,717
Let's hit it!

918
01:25:47,239 --> 01:25:52,399
I, Titus Abrasax,
take Jupiter Jones to be my wife.

919
01:25:52,499 --> 01:25:56,865
I enter into this union being
of sound mind and of my own volition.

920
01:25:56,966 --> 01:26:01,809
Would my liege place his hand here
to receive the signifying bond?

921
01:26:12,572 --> 01:26:13,946
Break left, I'm going right!

922
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,828
I'm hit!

923
01:26:35,907 --> 01:26:37,220
Your turn.

924
01:26:37,821 --> 01:26:39,847
Where are you at, Stinger?

925
01:26:41,028 --> 01:26:43,014
- I've lost a wing plate!
- I got you!

926
01:26:48,066 --> 01:26:49,202
Roll, roll, roll, roll!

927
01:26:55,630 --> 01:26:59,513
I, Jupiter Jones,

928
01:26:59,613 --> 01:27:02,587
take Titus Abrasax to be my husband.

929
01:27:14,709 --> 01:27:17,482
"I enter into this union being..."

930
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:22,047
I enter into this union...

931
01:27:22,323 --> 01:27:26,707
being of sound mind...
and of my own volition.

932
01:27:36,852 --> 01:27:38,597
We're clear!

933
01:27:41,794 --> 01:27:46,671
Would Your Majesty place her hand here
to receive the signifying bond?

934
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:52,975
I'm tracking heavy SIM activity.
That's gotta be where she is.

935
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:02,025
Cover me!

936
01:28:09,073 --> 01:28:12,388
What's going on? What was that?

937
01:28:13,768 --> 01:28:14,755
No.

938
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:30,870
Caine?

939
01:28:34,212 --> 01:28:38,932
Mr. Wise, you are as resourceful
as promised.

940
01:28:39,032 --> 01:28:42,311
This whole thing was nothing but a lie.

941
01:28:42,529 --> 01:28:45,703
- Was the ring executed?
- No.

942
01:28:45,803 --> 01:28:49,709
Once you were married
he was going to murder you.

943
01:28:49,809 --> 01:28:52,481
He told me right before
he threw me out the airlock.

944
01:28:55,103 --> 01:28:59,562
Honestly, I don't believe my mother
was ever as beautiful,

945
01:29:00,563 --> 01:29:02,602
or as gullible as you, my dear.

946
01:29:04,171 --> 01:29:06,466
May I kill him?

947
01:29:07,309 --> 01:29:09,340
Just get me out of here.

948
01:29:21,921 --> 01:29:24,793
- Your Majesty?
- Please, don't call me that.

949
01:29:24,893 --> 01:29:26,966
Titus will pay.

950
01:29:27,066 --> 01:29:30,623
- Captain Tsing has already filed...
- I don't care.

951
01:29:31,167 --> 01:29:33,053
The more you care,

952
01:29:33,153 --> 01:29:37,000
the more the world finds ways
to hurt you for it.

953
01:29:44,548 --> 01:29:48,055
That's your pardon. Congratulations.

954
01:29:48,155 --> 01:29:50,853
You and Stinger
are officially skyjackers again.

955
01:29:54,284 --> 01:29:56,023
Thank you.

956
01:29:57,563 --> 01:30:00,981
- When we were in the commonwealth...
- I don't wanna talk.

957
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:10,038
I really just wanna go home.

958
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:22,271
Mom? Oh, God, no. Nino?

959
01:30:22,371 --> 01:30:24,927
Good evening, Your Majesty.

960
01:30:25,027 --> 01:30:27,397
Easy, Dingo.

961
01:30:29,586 --> 01:30:30,988
Where's my family?

962
01:30:31,088 --> 01:30:35,596
Well, we can all only hope
that they remain unharmed.

963
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:41,993
I see you have the standard issue
Abrasax temper.

964
01:30:42,093 --> 01:30:43,914
A transfer of title
has already been processed.

965
01:30:44,014 --> 01:30:46,986
You and your Lord are trespassing
in this precinct.

966
01:30:47,086 --> 01:30:50,822
We are aware of all current legalities.

967
01:30:50,922 --> 01:30:53,782
I have been instructed
to offer your grace a proposal.

968
01:30:54,483 --> 01:30:57,845
- What proposal?
- You are to come with me to meet My Lord.

969
01:30:57,945 --> 01:31:02,489
They will abdicate your title

970
01:31:02,589 --> 01:31:07,075
and in return My Lord guarantees
that he will do everything in his power

971
01:31:07,175 --> 01:31:11,417
to see that no harm comes to you
or your family.

972
01:31:11,517 --> 01:31:14,195
You can't do it, Your Majesty.
You cannot trust these people.

973
01:31:14,295 --> 01:31:17,911
If you abdicate, you'll have nothing
to protect yourself.

974
01:31:19,614 --> 01:31:21,903
You're going to kill them
if I don't come with you.

975
01:31:22,003 --> 01:31:25,961
Your Majesty, I could not even consider
such an abhorrent crime.

976
01:31:26,061 --> 01:31:28,984
- He's lying.
- You wound me, Mr. Wise.

977
01:31:29,084 --> 01:31:32,357
If I were trying to wound you, Mr. Night,
you wouldn't be breathing.

978
01:31:32,457 --> 01:31:35,796
If it makes everyone feel warm and cozy,

979
01:31:35,897 --> 01:31:38,518
the Aegis is welcome to follow us.

980
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:41,975
No. She won't be going
anywhere with you.

981
01:31:42,075 --> 01:31:47,102
Very well. I will inform My Lord
you have rejected his offer.

982
01:31:48,544 --> 01:31:50,279
Wait.

983
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:57,972
This is my family.

984
01:31:58,072 --> 01:32:00,093
It's too dangerous.

985
01:32:00,193 --> 01:32:02,201
I know...

986
01:32:02,301 --> 01:32:04,345
but it's not your decision.

987
01:32:16,158 --> 01:32:19,321
This is Greeghan, on approach.

988
01:32:19,421 --> 01:32:22,357
We have an escort.

989
01:32:25,108 --> 01:32:28,983
Mr. Nesh, keep us close.
Mr. Wise, that pacing's not helping.

990
01:32:29,478 --> 01:32:32,060
<i>The gate is prepped
and standing by, sir.</i>

991
01:32:36,369 --> 01:32:39,919
- Captain Tsing!
- They're closing the vortex! Shields up!

992
01:32:40,739 --> 01:32:42,691
Accelerate to full.

993
01:32:48,353 --> 01:32:52,266
- We've lost all Nav-com, Captain!
- Grav-drive not responding!

994
01:32:53,547 --> 01:32:55,032
Shields failing!

995
01:32:57,303 --> 01:32:59,337
Get us out of here, Nesh!

996
01:33:17,659 --> 01:33:18,778
Damn it.

997
01:33:58,956 --> 01:34:01,529
Where's my family?

998
01:34:01,629 --> 01:34:04,083
You should have stayed dead.

999
01:34:04,183 --> 01:34:06,388
I am not your mother.

1000
01:34:06,888 --> 01:34:11,313
No, my mother
never cleaned a toilet in her life.

1001
01:34:11,414 --> 01:34:14,085
Maybe that was her problem.

1002
01:34:14,369 --> 01:34:16,957
My mother...

1003
01:34:21,203 --> 01:34:27,895
My mother taught me what was necessary
to rule in this universe.

1004
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:30,139
Like killing people?

1005
01:34:31,028 --> 01:34:34,600
I create life!

1006
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:37,714
And I destroy it.

1007
01:34:39,416 --> 01:34:41,120
Life...

1008
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:45,618
is an act of consumption... Jupiter.

1009
01:34:45,897 --> 01:34:48,351
To live...

1010
01:34:48,451 --> 01:34:51,040
is to consume.

1011
01:34:51,831 --> 01:34:56,568
Now the human beings on your planet
are merely a resource...

1012
01:34:56,668 --> 01:34:59,945
waiting to be converted into capital.

1013
01:35:01,243 --> 01:35:03,831
And this entire enterprise

1014
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:07,662
is just a small part in a vast...

1015
01:35:07,762 --> 01:35:11,813
and beautiful machine
defined by evolution,

1016
01:35:11,913 --> 01:35:15,956
designed to a single purpose...

1017
01:35:18,692 --> 01:35:20,665
to create profit.

1018
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:25,941
If that's what your mother taught you,
then I can see why you hated her.

1019
01:35:28,343 --> 01:35:30,643
I loved my mother.

1020
01:35:30,744 --> 01:35:33,256
And yet, you're trying to kill me.

1021
01:35:34,357 --> 01:35:36,795
My mother...

1022
01:35:37,496 --> 01:35:42,447
made me understand
that every human society is a pyramid

1023
01:35:42,548 --> 01:35:46,714
and that some lives will always
matter more than others.

1024
01:35:48,965 --> 01:35:52,024
It is better to accept this...

1025
01:35:52,525 --> 01:35:56,064
than to pretend it isn't... true.

1026
01:35:59,593 --> 01:36:01,240
Is that why you killed her?

1027
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:04,837
How dare you?!

1028
01:36:23,233 --> 01:36:28,010
I know because of who and what you are,
you're unable to say this...

1029
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:31,093
so I'll say it for you.

1030
01:36:32,202 --> 01:36:36,400
You lied in the commonwealth
because you're a Hunter...

1031
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:40,384
who's been searching
for one thing his whole life.

1032
01:36:41,185 --> 01:36:43,090
You survived so long without it,

1033
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:46,884
the fact that you may have
found it terrifies you,

1034
01:36:46,984 --> 01:36:50,354
but not as much as the fact
that she's down there...

1035
01:36:50,954 --> 01:36:53,360
buried in several tons of hurricane.

1036
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:57,773
And if you wanna see her again,
then you take my advice...

1037
01:36:57,873 --> 01:37:01,025
you get down there
and you start digging.

1038
01:37:07,436 --> 01:37:09,307
This is a notice of abdication.

1039
01:37:09,908 --> 01:37:12,864
You will confess
your genetic incapacity to rule

1040
01:37:12,964 --> 01:37:15,887
and you will return the title
to its natural heir.

1041
01:37:16,587 --> 01:37:17,963
Where's my family?

1042
01:37:28,678 --> 01:37:30,645
Mom! Oh, God.

1043
01:37:33,102 --> 01:37:37,110
I... I will do whatever
it is that you want,

1044
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:39,833
so long as the Aegis can get
my family out of here safely.

1045
01:37:39,933 --> 01:37:42,923
You are in no position to negotiate.

1046
01:37:51,304 --> 01:37:55,285
Stop. Stop, stop, stop!
I will do anything. Please, you win.

1047
01:37:55,385 --> 01:37:58,018
I beg of you, stop. Please.

1048
01:38:19,192 --> 01:38:21,029
<i>Mr. Wise, as a matter of public record,</i>

1049
01:38:21,129 --> 01:38:24,486
I must inform you that I strongly advise
against this reckless course of action

1050
01:38:24,586 --> 01:38:27,557
that will almost certainly
cost you your life.

1051
01:38:27,657 --> 01:38:29,461
Understood.

1052
01:38:31,205 --> 01:38:35,105
Off the record, I will tell you
that you're a man of rare courage...

1053
01:38:35,206 --> 01:38:36,946
and I pray your aim is true.

1054
01:38:38,759 --> 01:38:40,158
Thank you.

1055
01:39:42,218 --> 01:39:45,625
And hereby return the title
to its original heir,

1056
01:39:45,725 --> 01:39:48,230
Balem Abrasax.

1057
01:39:53,541 --> 01:39:56,129
Once I seal this...

1058
01:39:56,629 --> 01:39:59,038
How long until you harvest the earth?

1059
01:39:59,138 --> 01:40:01,940
I can promise that you will not see it.

1060
01:40:02,441 --> 01:40:03,794
But how long?

1061
01:40:05,195 --> 01:40:09,956
You knew nothing of harvesting before.
Why should it matter now?

1062
01:40:10,356 --> 01:40:15,093
Remember why you're here.

1063
01:40:19,324 --> 01:40:21,796
I came here to try to protect my family.

1064
01:40:22,797 --> 01:40:24,985
Seal that sheave,

1065
01:40:25,085 --> 01:40:29,310
and you and your family
will return home safely.

1066
01:40:36,089 --> 01:40:38,645
If I don't seal this...

1067
01:40:40,363 --> 01:40:43,656
you can't touch the earth,
even if you kill me.

1068
01:40:43,756 --> 01:40:45,607
Is that right?

1069
01:40:45,707 --> 01:40:49,248
That planet belongs to me.

1070
01:40:49,548 --> 01:40:51,162
It is my right.

1071
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:00,378
Not anymore.

1072
01:41:01,671 --> 01:41:05,346
You have no idea what you're doing.

1073
01:41:05,446 --> 01:41:09,630
I am making sure that whatever
you do to me and my family,

1074
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:12,420
you're not able to do to anyone else's.

1075
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:15,357
This is not a game.

1076
01:41:16,533 --> 01:41:20,008
I am not my brother or my sister.

1077
01:41:20,108 --> 01:41:23,081
- If you do not seal...
- Beg pardon, My Lord.

1078
01:41:23,181 --> 01:41:25,039
- Mr. Night!
- It is an emergency!

1079
01:41:25,139 --> 01:41:27,281
The grav-hull is ruptured.

1080
01:41:27,422 --> 01:41:30,408
The gas is reacting to the stock works.

1081
01:41:38,142 --> 01:41:40,455
You seal it now.

1082
01:41:52,370 --> 01:41:54,614
Seal it now!

1083
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:10,454
My Lord, is that advisable
without the abdication?

1084
01:42:12,825 --> 01:42:14,395
Kill her!

1085
01:42:23,981 --> 01:42:26,274
Here, take this. Get your family out.

1086
01:42:26,374 --> 01:42:28,217
Wait.

1087
01:42:32,781 --> 01:42:34,720
In case we don't get the chance again.

1088
01:42:37,473 --> 01:42:39,271
Go.

1089
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:45,318
I'm getting readings from the refinery.
It's destabilized. Sinking fast.

1090
01:43:27,586 --> 01:43:30,142
- Captain, the gate's open.
- It's an evacuation.

1091
01:43:34,568 --> 01:43:36,830
Get us down there, Nesh.

1092
01:43:50,889 --> 01:43:54,709
You're just like her.
You won't pull that trigger.

1093
01:44:10,971 --> 01:44:12,847
Jupiter!

1094
01:46:57,175 --> 01:47:00,648
You hurt me.

1095
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:06,761
And I'm gonna make you regret it.

1096
01:47:48,373 --> 01:47:51,652
- Captain, I'm tracking a ping.
- Is it Her Majesty?

1097
01:47:51,752 --> 01:47:53,567
Signature unknown.
Attempting to lock in.

1098
01:47:54,168 --> 01:47:57,809
This is Captain Tsing of the Aegis.
We are tracking. Can you click back?

1099
01:47:58,310 --> 01:48:00,646
- <i>This is Caine.</i>
- Yes!

1100
01:48:00,746 --> 01:48:04,437
<i>I have the family. Can you extract?</i>

1101
01:48:54,418 --> 01:48:58,709
- Caine, we can't wait long!
- Give me every second you can.

1102
01:49:26,129 --> 01:49:28,667
Is this familiar, Mother?

1103
01:49:29,953 --> 01:49:33,269
Does some part of you
remember this like I do?

1104
01:49:33,369 --> 01:49:36,553
Well, this is how it began!

1105
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:43,052
We were fighting.

1106
01:49:43,663 --> 01:49:46,685
Do you remember what you said?

1107
01:50:08,812 --> 01:50:12,128
I remember what you said.

1108
01:50:16,827 --> 01:50:20,550
You told me you hated your life.

1109
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:22,654
It's the truth.

1110
01:50:24,079 --> 01:50:26,432
And you begged me to do it.

1111
01:50:29,267 --> 01:50:32,008
You begged me to do it!

1112
01:50:32,708 --> 01:50:35,930
I am not your damn mother.

1113
01:51:24,591 --> 01:51:27,484
Jupiter. Just breathe.

1114
01:51:27,714 --> 01:51:29,726
Just breathe.

1115
01:51:30,887 --> 01:51:33,519
- My family?
- They're safe.

1116
01:51:40,374 --> 01:51:42,349
- Medic!
- We can't hold much longer!

1117
01:51:42,449 --> 01:51:44,984
Set a portal. Now!

1118
01:51:45,084 --> 01:51:47,139
Captain, I don't need to tell you
how dangerous it is to...

1119
01:51:47,239 --> 01:51:50,737
Then don't!
I promised every second I could.

1120
01:51:56,635 --> 01:51:58,132
Oh, no.

1121
01:52:14,968 --> 01:52:18,684
- Twelve ticks to portal.
- Eruption imminent!

1122
01:52:31,083 --> 01:52:33,924
- Portal's open!
- Come on, Caine.

1123
01:52:40,221 --> 01:52:42,627
Core-gen's about to blow!

1124
01:52:54,671 --> 01:52:55,481
Now!

1125
01:53:06,514 --> 01:53:10,089
- Everyone all right?
- Aye, Captain.

1126
01:53:11,759 --> 01:53:15,869
Captain, I don't understand,
but I'm pinging Mr. Wise again.

1127
01:53:16,770 --> 01:53:18,659
What?

1128
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:23,403
- <i>Hello in there.</i>
- Wise, where are you?

1129
01:53:23,503 --> 01:53:25,758
<i>Why don't you take a look
out your window?</i>

1130
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:29,801
<i>You might want to open the door
for us or something.</i>

1131
01:53:57,580 --> 01:53:59,351
Jupiter.

1132
01:53:59,452 --> 01:54:03,710
Jupiter, get up. Make the coffee.

1133
01:54:10,043 --> 01:54:12,028
Morning, Nino.

1134
01:54:16,706 --> 01:54:18,164
Morning, mama.

1135
01:54:41,546 --> 01:54:44,449
- Jupiter.
- Yeah?

1136
01:54:45,188 --> 01:54:48,179
- Need help?
- All done.

1137
01:54:50,114 --> 01:54:53,373
- Big moment.
- English, please.

1138
01:54:53,473 --> 01:54:55,374
Vladie.

1139
01:54:55,774 --> 01:54:58,134
Look, Jupiter...

1140
01:54:58,334 --> 01:55:01,491
I know we don't always see eye to eye.

1141
01:55:02,227 --> 01:55:04,216
But...

1142
01:55:04,651 --> 01:55:07,873
- well...
- For you, my dear.

1143
01:55:09,628 --> 01:55:11,848
Why, you guys?
It's not even my birthday.

1144
01:55:11,949 --> 01:55:14,388
Vladie told us what you wanted
the money for.

1145
01:55:14,488 --> 01:55:17,878
You didn't. No.

1146
01:55:19,182 --> 01:55:21,486
Are you serious?

1147
01:55:23,391 --> 01:55:25,312
Oh, my God.

1148
01:55:26,214 --> 01:55:27,501
Oh, my God.

1149
01:55:27,601 --> 01:55:30,050
- We all pitched in.
- Thank you.

1150
01:55:30,150 --> 01:55:32,379
Your father was good man...

1151
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:35,602
and I loved him very much.

1152
01:55:36,404 --> 01:55:39,176
And you should have this.

1153
01:55:39,478 --> 01:55:42,108
Could we take it up to the roof?

1154
01:55:43,527 --> 01:55:45,135
I'm so sorry. I...

1155
01:55:45,892 --> 01:55:47,896
- I actually have a date.
- What?!

1156
01:55:48,932 --> 01:55:50,670
- Is he Russian?
- Is he rich?

1157
01:55:50,770 --> 01:55:52,879
- Does he have a younger brother?
- Does he need a big television?

1158
01:55:52,979 --> 01:55:54,461
- How is he with a mop?
- What's his name?

1159
01:55:54,561 --> 01:55:58,872
- More importantly, what's his sign?
- I don't know.

1160
01:56:04,184 --> 01:56:08,260
I guess you can say my family's complicated
the way that most families are complicated.

1161
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:12,368
- You think you'll ever tell them?
- What, that I own the earth?

1162
01:56:13,655 --> 01:56:15,697
Are you kidding me?
They'd have me locked up.

1163
01:56:16,197 --> 01:56:18,113
And I wouldn't blame them either.

1164
01:56:18,213 --> 01:56:22,174
Besides... I'm still trying to understand
exactly what it means myself.

1165
01:56:22,425 --> 01:56:24,435
Well, maybe it just means
that Your Majesty's planet

1166
01:56:24,535 --> 01:56:27,437
has a different future than the one
that was planned for it.

1167
01:56:29,807 --> 01:56:31,006
Say that again.

1168
01:56:32,376 --> 01:56:35,638
You mean... "Your Majesty"?

1169
01:56:37,235 --> 01:56:39,233
That really works for me.

1170
01:56:39,333 --> 01:56:41,936
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1171
01:56:42,036 --> 01:56:44,194
All right.

1172
01:56:44,294 --> 01:56:46,395
Come on.

1173
01:56:54,481 --> 01:56:56,659
That ain't bad either.

1174
01:57:09,698 --> 01:57:11,487
Well, I can get used to this.

1175
01:57:27,806 --> 01:57:30,045
You ready?

1176
01:57:30,145 --> 01:57:31,906
Watch this.

1176
01:57:32,305 --> 01:58:32,683
