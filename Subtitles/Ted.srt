00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:55,776
Submitted here is the story of a little
boy, and a magical christmas wish,

2
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:58,651
that changed his life...
forever.

3
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:06,744
It began in 1985, in a
town just outside Boston.

4
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:12,453
It was christmas eve, and all the
children were in high spirits.

5
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:17,469
That special time of year, when
Boston children gather together

6
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:22,277
- and beat up the jewish kids.
- Hey greenbob! Get him!

7
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:30,641
But there was one child who
wasn't in such good spirits,

8
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,657
little John Bennett.

9
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:37,794
That one boy in every neighbourhood, who
just has a tough time making friends.

10
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,551
Hey guys, can I play?

11
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:42,094
- Get out of here bennet!
- Get lost bennet!

12
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:44,473
- Get out of here bennet.
- Yeah bennet, get lost.

13
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:53,425
John longed with all his heart, for that
one true friend that he could call his own

14
00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,066
and he knew that if he ever found
that friend, he would ever let him go

15
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:06,126
well, as it does every year,
christams morning finally came

16
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:10,418
all of the children were opening
their gifts with holiday glee

17
00:02:17,477 --> 00:02:24,021
and for little John bennet, christams
day brought a very special new arrival.

18
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,400
Wow.i guess santa payed attention to
how good you were this year huh...

19
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:36,594
aww, merry christams John.

20
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,993
"I love you."

21
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:40,810
He talks.

22
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:44,740
I'm gonna name you Teddy.

23
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:53,521
John became instantly attached to teddy,
there was something about that bear

24
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:56,736
that made him feel as if
he finally had a friend.

25
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:59,940
With whom he could share
his deepest secrets.

26
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:01,446
"I love you"

27
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,976
I love you too teddy

28
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:09,054
you know, I wish you
could really talk to me

29
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,740
because then we could be best
friends forever and ever

30
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:17,459
now if theres one thing
you can be sure of,

31
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:22,031
its that nothing is more
powerful than a young boys wish

32
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,899
except an apache helicopter...
an apache helicopter

33
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:28,469
has machine guns and missiles

34
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:32,292
it is an unbelievably impressive
complement of weaponry.

35
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:34,904
An absolute death machine.

36
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,029
Well, as it turned out, John had
picked a perfect night to make a wish.

37
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:19,850
Teddy...

38
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:25,280
Teddy?

39
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:30,972
Teddy?

40
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:40,464
Hug me.

41
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,557
You're my best friend John.

42
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:46,677
Did you... did you just talk...

43
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:50,017
don't look so surprised, your the
one who wished for it arent you?

44
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:54,828
Yeah... I did wish for it.

45
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:56,505
Well, here I am...

46
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,843
you mean... we get to be
best friends for real?

47
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:01,301
For... real.

48
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:02,769
Forever and ever?

49
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,367
Sounds good to me

50
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:09,109
John was just about the
happiest boy in the world.

51
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:12,551
And he couldn't wait to
tell everyone the good news

52
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:15,590
mom... dad... guess what,
my teddy bears alive

53
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,513
really... oh isnt
that exciting...

54
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:21,462
No mom, he's really alive.
Look.

55
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:23,706
Merry christmas everybody

56
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,594
Jesus H Fuck... Lets
all be best friends.

57
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:29,374
Oh my god.

58
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,667
Get away from that thing,
get over here right now.

59
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:33,319
But dad... Get over here!

60
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:35,874
- Listen to your father, come here.
- Helen, get my gun.

61
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:36,834
Dad, no!

62
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:38,179
Is it a hugging gun?

63
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,658
Helen, get my gun
and call the police

64
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:43,314
im sorry mr bennet, I didn't
mean to scare anybody

65
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:45,461
I just wanted john
and I to be friends

66
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:50,136
yeah dad, I made a wish last night that
teddy was alive, and my wish came true.

67
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:53,444
Oh god.

68
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,557
It's a miracle.

69
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:59,899
It's a christmas miracle.

70
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:02,844
You're just like the baby Jesus.

71
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:10,131
Well it wasnt long before the news of Johns
little miracle was sweeping the nation

72
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:14,260
out of a Boston suburb comes, what is
without doubt the most incredible story

73
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:18,883
a young boys stuffed animal, has magically
come to life for unknown reasons.

74
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:23,460
LOOK WHAT JESUS DID!
LOOK WHAT JESUS DID!

75
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:28,587
Before long, teddy had become a
huge celebrity in his own right.

76
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,446
Hello, Teddy.

77
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,154
You surprise me, for some reason I
thought you were going to be taller

78
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,426
I thought you were
going to be funnier.

79
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:57,472
But for all the fame, teddy never
forgot his very best friend, John

80
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:01,024
the thunder cant get us, right?

81
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:04,204
Nope. Were thunder buddys.
And the thunder knows it

82
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,153
were totally safe.

83
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:09,319
- Teddy.
- Yeah, John?

84
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:12,106
Do you promise that we'll
always be together?

85
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,152
I promise.

86
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:19,034
Thunder buddys for life

87
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:22,180
thunder buddys for life.

88
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:28,500
And that was a promise that
niether one of them forgot

89
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:32,800
So... where are John
and teddy today?

90
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:35,068
Well, let me put it this way

91
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:38,368
no matter how big a splash you
make in this world, weather your a

92
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:42,388
Corey Feldman, Frankie
Muniz, Justin Bieber...

93
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:46,621
or a talking teddy bear...
eventually nobody gives a shit.

94
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,499
TED

95
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,360
Look, all im saying is that
Boston women are, on the whole,

96
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:29,601
a paler uglier sort than women
from the elsewheres of life.

97
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:31,787
That's bullshit... what about Lori?
She's hot.

98
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:33,876
No Lori's from Pennsylvania
thats not a Boston girl

99
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:34,964
there not that bad...

100
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:39,040
see, the fact that you have to say there
not that bad, means that they are that bad

101
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:44,884
you ever hear a Boston girl have an orgasm?
Oh yah, oh yah, hardar hardar

102
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:50,194
oh god... that was so good. Now im gonna
stuff my fucking face with pepper flan

103
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:56,468

104
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:59,210

with my weed guy

105
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:00,359

106
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,833
I think it sucks, im gonna
have a talk with him

107
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:04,360
I don't know you want to go to
a drug dealer with complaints

108
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:06,120
ive known this guy a long time,

109
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,966

114
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:17,801
It's ok. I'll drive you.

115

118
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,719
- John, may I speak with you please?
- Shit.

119
00:11:55,787 --> 00:11:57,799

00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,971
- And you don't remember it?
- No, same as last time.

158
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:05,213
It just seems kind
of gay doesn't it?

159
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:07,279
I don't know, maybe yeah.

160
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,719
Do you think your part of
some gay beat up underworld?

161
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,777
Like one of those gay beat
up clubs or something?

162
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,956
I don't now, I dig chicks man,
I don't remember any of it

163
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:16,921
I was so fucked up. I might
be gay I don't know.

164
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,481
Do you mind covering
for me for a bit?

165
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,431
I might go lay down in the John

166
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:21,970

Hey Alex

167
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:23,620
what's up? You get in
the club last night?

168
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,849
Ahh, I didn't get in because
the bouncer was douche face

169
00:14:26,884 --> 00:14:29,037
but I make friends in the line

170
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:30,177
well thats good I guess.

171
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:32,539
Hey guys, anybody know
a nice restaurant?

172
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,748
Like something where they give out
free bubblegum in the bathrooms.

173
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,158
For what?

174
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:37,820
Lori and I have been
dating 4 years tomorrow.

175
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,471
I wanna take her some
place really nice.

176
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:41,517
Aw, congratulations John.

177
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:45,671
You guys have been going out for 4 years?
My last relationship lasted 6 months.

178
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:48,047
Then she farted in her sleep.
I'm like, I'm out of here man.

179
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:49,419
And I was gone
before she woke up.

180
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:51,802
Wow your not very
tolerant huh...

181
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:53,623
Lori ever fart in front of you?

182
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:54,819
Yeah.

183
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:57,542
- Really?
- A million times.

184
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:59,377
You italian?

185
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:00,473
No.

186
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:01,971
Why?

187
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:04,531
Nevermind, take her to biniarta

188
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:06,725
John look, don't you think
after 4 years maybe

189
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,908
shes hoping for something
more than dinner?

190
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:10,048
Like what?

191
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,133
I don't know. But if it were
me, id be expecting a proposal

192
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:17,169
oh come on, no ones expecting
anybody to propose...

193
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:21,744
I mean marriage isnt... i mean... isnt love enough?
I submit love is enough

194
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,122
you can put the ring in her ass...
and let her fart it out?

195
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,008
So bad, but so good...

196
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:37,507
Hey by the way, don't let
me forget you and I got to

197
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,995
nail down a plan for the
ruins game tomorrow night.

198
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,915
Oh no I cant, I'm
taking Lori to dinner.

199
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:43,928
For what?

200
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,041
Well, weve been dating
4 years tomorrow.

201
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,482
Ohh... fuck me, nice.

202
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:48,882
Let me ask you something,

203
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:52,086
you don't think shes going to be
expecting something big, do you?

204
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,552
- What... like anal?
- No...

205
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,905
like a circular gold
thing on the finger.

206
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,930
Oh fuck that. Its been 4 years Johnny you
and me have been together for 27 years.

207
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:02,411
Wheres my ring?

208
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:04,006
Huh... wheres my
ring asshole...

209
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,342

Put it on my

210
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:10,171
- fuzzy finger you fuck.
- Alright knock it off

211
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:11,579
I'm just sayin...

212
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:14,002
do you think she might be expecting
me to make that kind of a move?

213
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:15,787
No no no, I don't think

214
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:17,815
and not only that,
its the wrong time

215
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,163
its a terrible idea, you
got the economy, you

216
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:22,499
got the credit bubble,
the supreme court

217
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:23,815
look at Haiti

218
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,197
I guess I didn't
think about that.

219
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,151
Well, you know, it's a factor.

220
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:32,209
Who are you? -Flash Gordon,
quarterback, New York Jets.

221
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:35,068
This is the american
fantasy right here.

222
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:39,033
A professional NFL player is called
upon to save the world. -Yeah.

223
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:40,033
Tom Brady could do that...

224
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,671
Tom Brady could do that.

225
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:43,968
- Hey.
- Hey sweetie.

226
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,958
Hey, Lori.

227
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:46,221
Hi.

228
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:49,096
- What you got there?
- Turkey burgers

229
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:52,456
oh turkey burgers, are we having
homosexuals over for dinner?

230
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:55,408
- Tonight is it?
- Ha, no just you homos.

231
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:59,708
You kinda just re-worded
my joke, but haaaa.

232
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:02,121
- How was work?
- Oh it was fine

233
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:04,053
hows your dickhead boss?

234
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:07,237
Rex, is fine. He only hit
on me once today so,

235
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:08,733
its a good thing

236
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:10,338
hey Johnny how bout a beer huh?

237
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,117
Oh couple of chowbukowskis...

238
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:13,896
couple of brewstoievskis...

239
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:15,698
maybe a mibrewstowsky?

240
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,548
Perhaps a teddybrewski...
thats a good one

241
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,304
I think I too want a
martina navratilovaski

242
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,585
oh... no no no
that doesn't work.

243
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:26,241
Bullshit... that totally worked...
no, no

244
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:28,243
yeah it does, - it doesn't work

245
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:30,121
the name has to have a ski
at the end of it, and you

246
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:31,987
just put brewski at the end
of martina navratilova

247
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,013
I just thought we were
saying funny names.

248
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:37,456
No, no. It has to have ski at the end
of it, otherwise where's the challange?

249
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,893
If theres no ski at the
end of the root word,

250
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:42,318
then we'd just be
idiots saying nonsense.

251
00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:54,324
- Hey.
- They found the missing hikers.

252
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,936
- They did?
- Yeah. -What happened?

253
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:56,956
They said

254
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,819
they got seperated, and
one of them had there

255
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:00,671
foot stuck under a
rock for like 5 days

256
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:07,998
you know, if your leg got trapped under
a rock, id chew it off to get you free

257
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:10,325
- you would?
- I sure would

258
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:12,720
is that cannibalism?

259
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:15,310
No, I think its only
cannibalism if you swallow.

260
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,470
Oh yeah, don't worry about
that, 'cos I don't swallow.

261
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:20,441
Really? 'Cos that's
not what I heard.

262
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:23,104
Well its not true ok,
im a classy broad

263
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:26,118
yeah I can see that

264
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:31,204
umm, listen, speaking of classy chow
bellas a really expensive restaurant

265
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:36,197
so we can go anywhere else tomorrow. I
really don't care as long as were together

266
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:37,944
are you kidding me?

267
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:42,475
No, 4 years we've been going out... im
taking you to the best place in town

00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:51,357
Nasty girl

271

Alright come on lets

275
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:12,417
when you hear the sound of thunder
don't you get too scared.

276
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:16,220
Just grab your thunder buddy,
and say these magic words

277
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,705

the alarm for 11 A.M?

280
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:30,483

281
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:44,733

284
00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:56,040
You look a little flustered

285
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:58,673
im fine, I just didn't
have time for breakfast

286
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,474
and the garage was full ohh
and thats right, my boyfriend

287
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,575
cant sleep through a thunder
storm without his teddybear

288
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,149
I don't understand why you
keep putting up with him...

289
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:08,866
yeah, the guys 35 and hes working
for a rental car service...

290
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:11,905
you guys, its not about that.
I don't care about that

291
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,373
id love him if he was a janitor

292
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:17,552
he has a huge heart
and we laugh a lot

293
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:20,781
its just a bonus that hes like
the hottest guy in Boston

294
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:23,367
I don't know, I just wish
hed get his life together

295
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:28,123

to god it is because of that bear

296
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:31,180
you should give him an
ultimatum, its you or the bear

297
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:33,849
no, I cant do that. That
would devistate him

298
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:37,528

but im talking about a
mature relationship Lori

317
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:27,377

Actually, could you wrap
just this up for me please?

325
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:04,116
I wanna scare the
shit out of somebody.

326
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:05,132

352
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:37,694
you remember the night after the club, we
went and had late night eggs and waffles

353
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:41,810
till about 5 A.M, we watched a movie
on the little tv in the diner

dancing was not that bad

361
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:29,301

We said no such thing...

365
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:40,254
but I got you something anyway, in
clear violation of the no gift rule

366
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:41,612
we had no such rule...

367
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,855
Lori, I wanted to give this
to you for a long time

368
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:48,974
John...

369
00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:57,012

From the kiosk at the mall

370
00:24:58,212 --> 00:24:59,997

371
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:05,850

372
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:08,719

you something really special

373
00:25:08,754 --> 00:25:10,614
I just do have the

374
00:25:11,563 --> 00:25:15,173

this because I love you

375
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:18,781
your not going to have any sort of
career if you wasting time with ted.

376
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:19,749
Oh, geez. Here we go.

377
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,493
Baby, please ask ted to move out
so we can move on with our lives

378
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:25,403
Lori, look hes been my
best friend since I was 8

379
00:25:25,438 --> 00:25:28,002
I was not a popular child,
you have to understand

380
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:30,529
I had no friends
before he came along

381
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:32,746
hes the only reason I ever
gained any fucking confidence

382
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,703
but your no longer
8, your 35 years old

383
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:40,044
and unless your too blind to notice,
hes not your only friend anymore.

384
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,472
Can we talk about this another time and
just enjoy our anniversary dinner?

385
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,359
Oh shit, hang on a second

386
00:25:55,394 --> 00:25:57,818

the seat somewhere

00:25:57,853 --> 00:25:59,188

388
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:00,501

390
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:20,837

463
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:22,843

nobodys ever talked to
me like that before

470
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:44,579

Well, I am a former celebrity
in a minimum wage job.

474
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:42,510
This is how the cast of different
strokes feels all day, every day.

475
00:31:42,523 --> 00:31:46,001
Aweful, they must feel aweful...
the live ones must feel aweful.

476
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,128
Come on, it's not
that bad, okay?

477
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:50,206
I got a shitty job and I
assure you I am quite content.

478
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,522

weird interview.

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,677
Ed thought I was Alf. And he kept
muttering anti semitic comments.

488
00:32:16,712 --> 00:32:18,614
Thought Alf was Jewish
for some reason

489
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:21,455
have you ever considered selling the bear?
What? Excuse me

00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:02,857
I can totally see him taking you
down to the basement and slowly

508
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,573
delimbing while singing some
creepy victorian nursery rhyme

509
00:33:06,676 --> 00:33:09,953
"oh my little sixpence my pretty
little sixpence" Stop it.

510
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,797
" I love my sixpence"
Knock it off

511
00:33:11,832 --> 00:33:14,010

520
00:33:57,854 --> 00:34:00,446
Okay, so...

521
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:02,570

524
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:10,837
Alright.

525
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:38,024
Hey, there.

526
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,548
Hey.

527
00:34:42,238 --> 00:34:44,430
Listen, umm.

528
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:47,243
I just want to say thank you.

529
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:50,502
I know what you did wasn't easy.

530
00:34:50,537 --> 00:34:54,046
And I just want you to know
that I love you for it.

531
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:57,972
And... I think its a new
beginning for our relationship.

532
00:34:59,152 --> 00:35:01,955
Anything for you.

533
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:05,087
This is all part of the new
grown up John Bennett, so

534
00:35:05,122 --> 00:35:08,529
you better get used
to him really...

535
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:15,015
well... now I don't have to be
at work for another 20 minutes

536
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:19,269
well thats perfect, cos
im only going to need 1

537
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,910
you know what my favourite
thing about you is?

538
00:35:24,945 --> 00:35:29,628
Even after 4 years, you
can still surprise me

539
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:34,018
and to step up and change
such a huge part of

540
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:37,208
your life just to make
your girlfriend happier

541
00:35:37,243 --> 00:35:40,629
I don't know, I guess
most guys wouldnt do that

542
00:35:40,663 --> 00:35:43,575
well most guys don't have
you to motivate them

543
00:35:46,568 --> 00:35:49,891
I know im not a talking
teddybear, but...

544
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:53,904
at least you don't have to
make a magical wish to get me

545
00:35:53,938 --> 00:35:55,658
how do you know?

546
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:12,098
Ohh... is that a Flash Gordon ray
gun, or are you just ahppy to see me?

00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:33,703
It's going to be alright.

557
00:37:33,738 --> 00:37:36,752
I actually went through something
like this with my last boyfriend

558
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,497
- really?
- Yeah

559
00:37:38,532 --> 00:37:42,837
we were together for 8 months
and I really loved him

560
00:37:42,872 --> 00:37:47,485
and then he got deported back to Iran,
so I know what your going through

561
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,608
oh yeah. So I guess we both
lost our furry little guy

562
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:54,329

563
00:37:59,095 --> 00:38:02,731
hey ted. Hey Johnny what are you doing?
Wanna come over and catch a buzz?

564
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:04,916
Well I could probably
stop by after work

565
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:07,588

so I got the other shift

566
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:10,249

Just swing by for a bit...

567
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:12,147
I cant just ditch work man

568
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:14,759
im trying to get my shit together and be
an adult here you know, for Lori's sake

569
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:16,886
Johnny, 5 minuites and ill
kick you out, I promise

570
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:21,450
just come over. I got
the cheers dvd boxset

571
00:38:21,485 --> 00:38:22,928
and the guy down at the
store told me everybody

572
00:38:22,941 --> 00:38:24,394
talks shit about each
other in the inteviews

573
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,792
youll kick me out in 5?

574
00:38:26,827 --> 00:38:28,136
I will kick you out in 5

575
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:30,406
John, ill have to kick you out.
I have so much

576
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:32,665
teddybear paperwork to
get through it is sick

577
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,311
what do I tell Thomas?

578
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:35,790
Just tell him you
don't feel well

579
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:38,400
I got to cut out for a
bit, Lori tried to break

580
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:41,033
up a dog fight and guess
she got hurt pretty bad

581
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,190
oh my god

582
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:45,721
yeah thats the way she is. She sees
trouble and she tries to help out

583
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:47,826
and I guess one of these
dogs clamped its jaws on her

584
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,953
forearm, and wouldnt let go
untill a fireman showed up

585
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:51,631
and had to stick a
finger in its ass

586
00:38:52,857 --> 00:38:55,420
oh jesus. Yeah shes
pretty shook up

587
00:38:55,455 --> 00:38:57,568
up the dogs ass right...

588
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:59,538
yeah the dogs not
the firemans ass

589
00:38:59,573 --> 00:39:01,404
I thought the fireman stuck
his finger up his own ass

590
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,646
I don't think a firefighter
would do that, I mean...

591
00:39:03,681 --> 00:39:05,836
well go go, take care of it, let
me know how she is. Thank you. -Go

592
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:13,387
woody harrelson... smallest
dick ive ever seen on a man

593
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:17,536
see, thats why I watch these things.
Its like a

594
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:19,363
cool behind the scenes thing
that you wouldnt know

595
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:22,268
oh hey, listen, try this.

596
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:25,108
I told my weed guy to step
it up, and he gave me that

597
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:26,217
what is it?

598
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:29,108
Its called mind rape, its
actually pretty mellow

599
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:30,318
it doesn't sound very mellow

600
00:39:30,353 --> 00:39:32,316
well he only had 3 other batches

601
00:39:32,351 --> 00:39:35,445

602
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,646

family living next door,

610
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:08,373

713
00:45:36,811 --> 00:45:38,895

What a cunt... I hate
that word - what?

719
00:45:55,938 --> 00:45:59,397
That word, its like an electric saw
slashing everything in its path

720
00:45:59,432 --> 00:46:00,469
why would you say that?

721
00:46:00,505 --> 00:46:02,602
You dint exactly
stand up for me...

722
00:46:02,637 --> 00:46:05,729
im trying to walk a line here. I want

726
00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:18,224

fight that I tried to break up

727
00:46:19,437 --> 00:46:24,313
if I had to guess, id say you made up
some bullshit excuse to get out of work

728
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:28,159
to go to teds. Now...
am I right?

729
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:30,987
I made you out to be a hero

730
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:33,667
you know what John, we asked ted to move
out, to give ourselves a chance without it

731
00:46:33,701 --> 00:46:35,900
your not giving anything
a chance if your blowing

732
00:46:35,913 --> 00:46:38,123
off work to get high
with your teddybear

733
00:46:39,265 --> 00:46:43,599

stoned too much I know that

734
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:46,471
ive been bumming around with
ted too much, I know that too

735
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:50,303
you give me one more chance,
I promise I can fix it

736
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:54,690
John, I need a man. Not a
little boy with a teddybear

737
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:57,497
I know, done, man

738

745
00:47:24,692 --> 00:47:26,474
did you really just fart?

746
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:28,324
Yeah... but I pushed it
that way with my hand

747
00:47:29,341 --> 00:47:30,728
I wonder who its
going to hit first

748
00:47:30,763 --> 00:47:33,170
"so if I told them once, I told them a
million times, these numbers do not add up"

749
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:37,354
who did this to us?

750
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:40,931

John, Flash Gordon was the most
important influence of our

815
00:51:13,408 --> 00:51:16,658
informative years.he taught us
right from wrong, good from evil

816
00:51:16,693 --> 00:51:20,129
and the word acting apparently has
an extremly broad definition.

817
00:51:20,165 --> 00:51:24,749
Flash Gordon is the symbol of our friendship John.

good cry.she'll be fine.

917
01:00:52,657 --> 01:00:53,797
Youll talk to her
tomorrow come on upstairs

918
01:00:53,832 --> 01:00:56,795
are you even listening to me? Do you
even give any thread of a shit?

919
01:00:56,832 --> 01:01:01,353
Of course I do... Johnny, thunder
buddys for life, remember

920
01:01:01,387 --> 01:01:07,000
jesus, Lori was right.i shoulda stopped
hanging out with you along time ago

921
01:01:07,034 --> 01:01:09,256
im never going to have a
life with you around.

922
01:01:09,269 --> 01:01:11,502
Im 35 years old and
im going nowhere.

923
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:14,422
All I do is smoke pot and watch
movies with a teddy fucking bear.

924
01:01:14,457 --> 01:01:17,843
Because of that, I just
lost the love of my life

925
01:01:17,879 --> 01:01:21,645
Johnny... i... im sorry

926
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,081
I gotta be on my own ted.
I cant see you anymore

927
01:01:25,328 --> 01:01:28,314
John, wait, listen.

928
01:01:29,313 --> 01:01:30,253
"I love you"

929
01:02:30,386 --> 01:02:35,452
so, word through the grapevine
is that your newly solo

930
01:02:35,453 --> 01:02:37,383
Rex, I have a lot of
work I need to get to

931
01:02:37,418 --> 01:02:40,749
I have tickets to norah
jones at the hatshell

932
01:02:40,762 --> 01:02:44,102
tonight, and I would love
it if you'd go with me

933
01:02:44,137 --> 01:02:46,913
You're asking me out a week after
I broke up with somebody?

934
01:02:46,949 --> 01:02:51,160
look, im going to cut
the shit here please

935
01:02:51,196 --> 01:02:56,241
this is the first time you've been single
in all the years you've worked here

936
01:02:56,275 --> 01:02:58,957
just... go out with me one time?

937
01:02:58,993 --> 01:03:02,408
And if your miserable,
and you hate it. Then I

938
01:03:02,421 --> 01:03:05,848
promise, I will never
hint at the subject again

939
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:09,940
please Rex, I don't
think its smart

940
01:03:09,975 --> 01:03:12,699
im an asshole, I know that. It
worked for me in highschool.

941
01:03:12,712 --> 01:03:15,447
And its been a reflex ever since

942
01:03:15,481 --> 01:03:21,381
Lori, the worst that can happen is you
go on a fun casual date, with a guy

943
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:25,493
who just wants to prove that he can
be something more than a jerk.

944
01:03:25,528 --> 01:03:30,618
Plus you are a huge catch, and its about
time someone treated you that way

945
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,380
fuck it, fine

946
01:03:35,415 --> 01:03:37,854
sure beats crying myself
to sleep every night

947
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:40,682
and if that means getting you off
my back, well thats just a bonus

948
01:03:40,718 --> 01:03:42,269
I'll pick you up at 8.

949
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:52,112
Hey Johnny, it's me.

950
01:03:52,146 --> 01:03:54,008
Go away

951
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:57,281
Johnny open the door
please, I want to talk

952
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:09,007
jesus christ, what the fuck man

953
01:04:09,042 --> 01:04:11,600
sorry, look Johnny, I
know your pissed alright

954
01:04:11,634 --> 01:04:13,377
but just listen to
me for 5 seconds

955
01:04:13,412 --> 01:04:15,907
I saw Lori leaving the
apartment with Rex

956
01:04:15,941 --> 01:04:16,863
what?

957
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:19,908
Im serious John. I went over to talk to
her, maybe take some of the heat off you

958
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:21,562
and there he was, picking her up

959
01:04:21,594 --> 01:04:22,986
they were going to the hatshell

960
01:04:23,021 --> 01:04:25,485
your fucking unbelievable
you know that

961
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,860
I mean how stupid
do you think I am?

962
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:29,042
If you think that by making
shit up like that your going

963
01:04:29,055 --> 01:04:31,245
to make me choose some kind
of loyalty to you over her

964
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:33,337
your out your fucking mind. John
its the truth im telling you

965
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:35,328
you know what, get out of here

966
01:04:36,803 --> 01:04:38,296
you know what, your acting
like a cock you know that?

967
01:04:38,331 --> 01:04:41,265
What? Im acting like a cock?

968
01:04:41,299 --> 01:04:43,777
Yes, you are. So shut your meat
hole for a second and listen to me

969
01:04:43,778 --> 01:04:47,079
huh?...meat hole, thats
not right is it... no

970
01:04:47,114 --> 01:04:50,296
pudding hole... is that what
they say, no cant be that either

971
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:53,502
right.cos how can you have any
pudding, if you don't eat your meat

972
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,340
pink floyd thing... the
point is, your blaming

973
01:04:57,353 --> 01:04:59,904
me, for something that
you did to yourself

974
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:02,659
Lori was right about you.
You cannot take any

975
01:05:02,672 --> 01:05:05,401
responsibility for anything
that goes on in your life

976
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:06,779
oh and you can?

977
01:05:06,814 --> 01:05:09,033
I don't have to, im
a fucking teddybear

978
01:05:09,069 --> 01:05:12,708
you know something... i didn't tie
you up and drag you to that party

979
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,881
alright, I wanted you to come because
your supposedly my best friend

980
01:05:15,915 --> 01:05:17,407
you cant stand there
and tell me you havent

981
01:05:17,421 --> 01:05:18,922
always seen Lori as a
threat to our friendship

982
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,987
I mean it works out so much
better for you when were

983
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,041
getting fucked up on the
couch at 9A.M doesn't it?

984
01:05:23,076 --> 01:05:26,966
Listen to yourself, what am I, emperor
ming here controlling your mind

985
01:05:27,002 --> 01:05:29,681
That's your choice John.
And you know by blaming

986
01:05:29,694 --> 01:05:32,383
me, you just make yourself
look like a pussy

987
01:05:33,356 --> 01:05:38,114
you know, sometimes I think back to that
christmas morning, when I was 8 years old

988
01:05:38,148 --> 01:05:40,012
I wish id just gotten
a teddy ruxpin

989
01:05:41,025 --> 01:05:42,903
Say that one more time.

990
01:05:42,904 --> 01:05:46,306
teddy... rux... fucking... pin

991
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:16,382

01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:04,960

994
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:22,103
My dick is squished by the t.v

995
01:07:31,863 --> 01:07:35,465
im so sorry Johnny so am I man

996
01:07:36,442 --> 01:07:39,363
I love you I love you too

997
01:07:40,419 --> 01:07:41,749
Listen.

998
01:07:41,784 --> 01:07:45,138
you gotta let me help you make
things right with you and Lori

999
01:07:45,174 --> 01:07:47,583
theres no putting things
right, she fucking hates me

1000
01:07:47,618 --> 01:07:52,331
look, john, we can get her back

1001
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:58,142
you remember when you were 10? And you
hit that squirrel with your bb gun

1002
01:07:58,176 --> 01:08:02,228
and then when we seen it fall from the
tree we both started crying, you remember?

1003
01:08:02,263 --> 01:08:05,845
And we ran up to it, and
we tried to give it CPR

1004
01:08:05,879 --> 01:08:07,849
and it came back to life.

1005
01:08:07,885 --> 01:08:10,801
John, we could do that again

1006
01:08:10,802 --> 01:08:14,674
ted, we blew out its rib cage and crushed
its lungs trying to give it CPR.

1007
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:16,054
It died.

1008
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:19,451
Come on, were going
to the hatshell.

1009
01:09:10,466 --> 01:09:13,292
Thanks. We're gonna take a short
break, but well be back in a few.

1010
01:09:21,727 --> 01:09:23,934

to seeing me fully clothed

1026
01:09:57,392 --> 01:10:02,362
I know right. Me and norah met in 2002
at a party at belinda carlisle's house

1027
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:04,853
and we had awkward fuzzy
sex in the cloak room

1028
01:10:04,887 --> 01:10:06,534
actually you wernt so bad
for a guy with no penis

1029
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:10,198
yeah. You know, ive written so many
angry letters to hasbro about that

1030
01:10:12,477 --> 01:10:13,669
thank you

1031
01:10:13,704 --> 01:10:17,286
so im going to give my chops a rest,
and bring a friend up to the stage

1032
01:10:17,323 --> 01:10:21,512
hes going to sing a song to a special lady
in the audience who he loves very much

1033
01:10:21,547 --> 01:10:24,870
please give a big
hand, to John Bennett

1034
01:10:27,338 --> 01:10:29,617

1035
01:10:30,307 --> 01:10:32,470

1036
01:10:35,055 --> 01:10:37,410

1037
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:42,823
umm high, my names John bennett

1038
01:10:42,857 --> 01:10:46,614
and this is for Lori
Collins, cos I love you

1039
01:10:48,468 --> 01:10:51,460
and this song always
reminds me of the most

1040
01:10:51,473 --> 01:10:54,479
important night of my life.
The night we met

1041
01:10:55,239 --> 01:10:58,948
umm, this is the theme song
from the movie octopussy

1042
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:17,834
still better than Katy Perry

1043
01:11:41,484 --> 01:11:43,392
you suck, get off the stage

1044
01:11:43,425 --> 01:11:44,854
aww come on, give him a chance

1045
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:52,162
your an asshole

1046
01:11:58,436 --> 01:11:59,315
oh jesus

1047
01:12:00,589 --> 01:12:02,388
someone call an ambulance

1048
01:12:12,264 --> 01:12:13,568
that was insane

1049
01:12:13,603 --> 01:12:16,282
did you see the way the guys body hit the ground?
It was like a rag doll

1050
01:12:17,707 --> 01:12:19,682
id rather just not talk about it

1051
01:12:19,718 --> 01:12:21,416
you want to go get a
drink after this?

1052
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:23,631
I feel like I could use one
after seeing a guy almost die

1053
01:12:23,664 --> 01:12:26,385
uh nope, I think id rather
just have you take me home

1054
01:12:26,419 --> 01:12:29,093
one drink come on

1055
01:12:29,128 --> 01:12:31,119
no, not really feeling up to it

1056
01:12:31,154 --> 01:12:33,037
alright, I get it

1057
01:12:33,071 --> 01:12:35,676
and you know, I don't blame you

1058
01:12:35,711 --> 01:12:40,949
I mean thing about it, it was actually
unfair of him to embarrass you like that

1059
01:12:42,127 --> 01:12:44,842
just to be clear,
im not embarrassed

1060
01:12:44,878 --> 01:12:48,837
so John and I have our problems,
but at least he tried

1061
01:12:50,025 --> 01:12:53,137
you know what, I don't feel
like talking to you about this

1062
01:12:53,172 --> 01:12:55,067
where you going?

1063
01:12:55,101 --> 01:12:57,591
Taking a cab, im going home

1064
01:13:02,683 --> 01:13:03,711
finally

1065
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:18,086
down here, not looking up
your towell, swear to god

1066
01:13:18,121 --> 01:13:20,317
not looking up your towell, not
looking at your funny business

1067
01:13:20,353 --> 01:13:22,165
ted, what are you doing here?

1068
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:24,355
I need to talk to you

1069
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:27,013
listen if your here to fight
Johns battles for him its not...

1070
01:13:27,048 --> 01:13:30,367
just let me talk first alright, and
then you can say whatever you want

1071
01:13:34,617 --> 01:13:38,305
look, John loves you very much

1072
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,829
more than anything in the world

1073
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:43,442
and hes falling to fucking
pieces without you

1074
01:13:43,476 --> 01:13:47,421
he knows he screwed up huge.
But you gotta believe me,

1075
01:13:47,455 --> 01:13:52,497
it wasnt all his fault alright. I told
him to bail on you that night at Rex's

1076
01:13:52,532 --> 01:13:55,572
and he said no, he was going
to stay there with you

1077
01:13:55,608 --> 01:13:57,272
and I twisted his arm Lori

1078
01:13:57,307 --> 01:14:00,540
so if you just give
him one more chance

1079
01:14:00,577 --> 01:14:03,502
I promise I will leave,
and ill never come back

1080
01:14:03,538 --> 01:14:05,578
alright... hell be all yours

1081
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:11,220
ted, thats a really nice offer.
But I don't want you to do that

1082
01:14:11,255 --> 01:14:15,812
this is between John and me, and
I don't think it can be fixed

1083
01:14:15,847 --> 01:14:17,235
yeah because of me

1084
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:20,368
look look Lori, you
want him to be a man

1085
01:14:20,403 --> 01:14:23,954
but as long as hes got his teddybear,
hes always going to be a boy

1086
01:14:27,024 --> 01:14:32,661
hes waiting down at Charlies right now, so
if you go down there and just talk to him

1087
01:14:32,698 --> 01:14:35,336
ill be gone when you get back

1088
01:14:36,413 --> 01:14:37,821
forever

1089
01:14:38,982 --> 01:14:43,359
and youll see. Hell never
be scared of thunder again

1090
01:15:28,226 --> 01:15:30,845

1095
01:16:08,862 --> 01:16:10,989
You can thank ted

1096
01:16:15,131 --> 01:16:17,476

1097
01:16:17,509 --> 01:16:20,545

1099
01:16:25,505 --> 01:16:27,646
Yeah, works good

1100
01:16:28,737 --> 01:16:32,649
well I guess we cant make
small talk all day huh?

1101
01:16:33,654 --> 01:16:36,945
If its ok with you, I just
want to say what I want to say

1102
01:16:38,575 --> 01:16:40,619
look I could sit here and
tell you im sorry, and

1103
01:16:40,631 --> 01:16:42,686
it was a huge misunderstanding,
im ready to change

1104
01:16:42,722 --> 01:16:46,462
but I don't think you want
to hear any of that crap

1105
01:16:46,499 --> 01:16:51,397
im not going to try and get you to take me back.
I mean, why would you

1106
01:16:51,434 --> 01:16:54,371
ive been a really shitty boyfriend for
the last 4 years, I don't deserve you

1107
01:16:54,407 --> 01:16:59,624
Look, I know I didn't take our
relationship seriously. But Lori,

1108
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:01,940
I do love you more
than life itself

1109
01:17:01,975 --> 01:17:06,089
and I want is... i just
want to end on good terms

1110
01:17:06,123 --> 01:17:07,988
I owe that to you.

1111
01:17:08,022 --> 01:17:09,968
Alright, I want you to be
happy, you deserve that.

1112
01:17:10,002 --> 01:17:14,798
And I just hope, you know,
that we can still be friends

1113
01:17:16,975 --> 01:17:19,020
Thank you for being so honest.

1114
01:17:21,611 --> 01:17:23,132
That was pretty much it.

1115
01:17:26,292 --> 01:17:27,607

I was a little boy

1134
01:19:07,269 --> 01:19:10,479
I saw you on television,
and I thought you were the

1135
01:19:10,492 --> 01:19:13,709
most amazing most wonderful
thing id ever seen, ever.

1136
01:19:13,746 --> 01:19:20,694
And I asked my dad if I could
have a magical teddybear too

1137
01:19:20,729 --> 01:19:22,088
and he said no

1138
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:24,632
can you just email me the
rest of this story...

1139
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:26,708
and I was so heartbroken

1140
01:19:27,799 --> 01:19:31,793
and I promised myself
that if I ever had a

1141
01:19:31,806 --> 01:19:35,809
son, I would never, ever,
ever, say no to him

1142
01:19:37,162 --> 01:19:38,554
ever

1143
01:19:38,587 --> 01:19:42,078
maybe no to a snickers bar every
once and a while wouldn't hurt

1144
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:44,397
me and ted are going to
be best friends daddy

1145

01:26:44,543 --> 01:26:45,431

1224
01:27:49,232 --> 01:27:52,359
Sorry, somebody had to go

1225
01:27:52,394 --> 01:27:53,781

1226
01:27:59,328 --> 01:28:00,294
Ted?

1227
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:08,358
Oh my god.

1228
01:28:11,603 --> 01:28:13,098
Ahh, shit.

1229
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:40,827
- Jesus, stay here.
- No, no, no, John.

1230
01:28:40,862 --> 01:28:42,159
- Wait, John.
- Stay here.

1231
01:28:53,366 --> 01:28:54,708
You're mine, Ted.

1232
01:28:54,743 --> 01:28:57,638
Screw you pal, I belong
to John Bennett.

1233
01:28:57,672 --> 01:28:59,993
But I can give you love

1234
01:29:00,027 --> 01:29:03,043
and rocking horses, and dancing

1235
01:29:03,079 --> 01:29:06,202
I think we're very
far apart on this.

1236
01:29:25,811 --> 01:29:28,003
- Ted?
- Johnny.

1237
01:30:16,705 --> 01:30:17,345
Oh, my god.

1238
01:30:17,346 --> 01:30:19,199
Ted.

1239
01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:22,048
John.

1240
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:24,377
Lori, get the stuffing.
Get it all.

1241
01:30:29,246 --> 01:30:31,153

1245
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:44,817
I don't think so.

1246
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:49,508
I'm a... I'm... I'm in trouble

1247
01:30:49,543 --> 01:30:52,997
I need... I need to

1248
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:54,839
What is it?

1249
01:30:56,812 --> 01:30:59,831
Dont... don't ever

1250
01:31:00,891 --> 01:31:03,138

1262
01:36:03,324 --> 01:36:04,034
Ted.

1263
01:36:04,035 --> 01:36:06,202
- I'm alive Johnny,
- Oh my god.

1264
01:36:06,236 --> 01:36:09,494

01:36:09,529 --> 01:36:11,235

1267
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:15,286
some of the stuffing in
the wrong places John

1268
01:36:15,318 --> 01:36:19,483
I'm a little fucked up, but will you
take care of me forever and ever?

1269
01:36:21,917 --> 01:36:23,890
Nah... im just kidding with
you, I thought it would

1270
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:25,887
be funny if you thought
I was fucking retarded.

1271
01:36:25,922 --> 01:36:28,761
- You asshole.
- Come here you bastard.

1272
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:33,948
Welcome back ted.

1273
01:36:36,616 --> 01:36:37,966
It was you.

1274
01:36:38,002 --> 01:36:40,482
You did it.

1275
01:36:40,518 --> 01:36:44,231
Son of a bitch. You
wished for my life back.

1276
01:36:44,268 --> 01:36:47,010
No... no no.

1277
01:36:47,046 --> 01:36:48,861
I wished for my life back.

1278
01:37:01,484 --> 01:37:02,839
I love you.

1279
01:37:02,873 --> 01:37:04,208
I love you too.

1280
01:37:05,474 --> 01:37:07,658
And I want you to know that

1281
01:37:08,663 --> 01:37:11,972
after last night, I don't want to lose
anyone that matters to me ever again

1282
01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:14,707
I'm not gonna wait any
longer for my life to start.

1283
01:37:14,742 --> 01:37:17,005
Lori

1284
01:37:17,716 --> 01:37:19,950
will you marry me?

1285
01:37:21,005 --> 01:37:25,717
All I ever wanted was
you John Bennett.

1286
01:37:30,175 --> 01:37:34,669
And so, John and Lori and
ted, lived happily ever after

1287
01:37:34,703 --> 01:37:39,836
having discovered at last, that all
they really needed was each other

1288
01:37:42,363 --> 01:37:48,455
John and Lori were married in Cambridge,
by a very special justice of the peace

1289
01:37:48,490 --> 01:37:51,245
by the power vested in me

1290
01:37:51,278 --> 01:37:54,161
by the New York Jets

1291
01:37:54,196 --> 01:37:58,308
and by the united peoples
of the planet Mongo

1292
01:37:58,342 --> 01:38:02,968
I now pronounce
you, man and wife

1293
01:38:03,003 --> 01:38:05,105
you may kiss the bride Johnny

1294
01:38:28,817 --> 01:38:30,749
thanks so much for coming

1295
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:34,448
my daughter better be alive
you sick son of a bitch

1296
01:38:35,913 --> 01:38:38,783
I am so fake happy for her.

1297
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:09,454
Ahh, you know sam, theres only
one way to end a perfect day.

1298
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:10,657
What's that?

1299
01:39:10,693 --> 01:39:12,073
Flash jump.

1300
01:39:12,108 --> 01:39:13,317
Right.

1301
01:39:13,352 --> 01:39:15,819
1...2... 3.

1302
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:17,304
Yeah.

1303
01:39:22,735 --> 01:39:26,371
And that's the story of how
one magical wish, forever

1304
01:39:26,384 --> 01:39:30,031
changed the lives of three
very special friends.

1305
01:39:30,067 --> 01:39:35,124
Ted and Tammy-Lynn continued there
torrid love affair for quite some time.

1306
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:38,884
One afternoon, ted was caught
behind the deli counter,

1307
01:39:38,897 --> 01:39:42,633
eating potato salad off of
Tammy-Lynn's bare bottom.

1308
01:39:42,668 --> 01:39:45,989
He was instantly promoted
to store manager.

1309
01:39:47,051 --> 01:39:51,806
Sam Jones moved back to Hollywood, with
the goal of restarting his film career.

1310
01:39:51,841 --> 01:39:54,836
He currently resides in
burbank where he shares a

1311
01:39:54,849 --> 01:39:57,857
studio apartment with his
room mate brandon routh.

1312
01:39:57,893 --> 01:40:02,185
Remember brandon routh, from
that god aweful superman movie?

1313
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:06,560
Jesus christ. Thanks for getting our
hopes up and taking a giant shit on us.

1314
01:40:07,846 --> 01:40:12,560
Rex was forced to give
up his pursuit of Lori.

1315
01:40:12,594 --> 01:40:14,731
Not long after, he
fell into a deep

1316
01:40:14,744 --> 01:40:16,892
depression and died of
lou gehrig's disease.

1317
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:22,173
Donny was arrested by Boston police and
charged with kidnapping a plush toy.

1318
01:40:22,207 --> 01:40:24,710
The charge was dropped
when everyone realised

1319
01:40:24,723 --> 01:40:27,235
how completely
stupid that sounded.

1320
01:40:27,915 --> 01:40:31,339
Robert got a trainer, lost a
substantial amount of weight,

1321
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:34,035
and went on to become taylor lautner.
