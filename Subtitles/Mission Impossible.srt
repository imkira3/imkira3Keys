00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,518
<i>It was good...</i>

3
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:30,418
<i>... that you called us.</i>

4
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:34,448
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

5
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:38,146
<i>We were at the bar...</i>

6
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:44,810
<i>... drinking, having fun...</i>

7
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:51,076
<i>I don't even know how I got here.</i>

8
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,840
Come on, she's been under too long.

9
00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:58,426
<i>You're the only one who can help me.</i>

10
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:06,050
<i>Come on, come on...</i>

11
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:12,419
<i>- Tell me what I need to know.</i>
<i>- They'll kill me.</i>

12
00:01:15,197 --> 00:01:17,136
<i>You asked for my help.</i>

13
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:20,501
<i>Come on.</i>

14
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,456
<i>The contact in Minsk...</i>

15
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:29,290
Give us the name.

16
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:34,781
Dimitri... Miediev.

17
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:53,733
<i>- What now?</i>
<i>- Now we drink.</i>

18
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:55,860
<i>To friends.</i>

19
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:18,199
Get rid of that scum.

20
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,886
- Did we get it?
- We got it.

21
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,692
Would you like
to watch a movie, Mr Rosen?

22
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:10,187
- Care to watch a movie, Mr Phelps?
- No, I prefer the theatre.

23
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:13,729
Would you consider
the cinema of the Ukraine?

24
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:17,183
Perhaps you'd choose one for me.

25
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:24,009
Thank you.

26
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:52,712
<i>Good morning, Mr Phelps.</i>
<i>This is Alexander Golitsyn, -

27
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:57,837
<i>- an attachÃ© at our embassy</i>
<i>in Prague. He is also a traitor.</i>

28
00:04:58,056 --> 00:05:01,390
<i>He has stolen one half</i>
<i>of a CIA NOC list-</i>

29
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,888
<i>- of all our deep cover agents</i>
<i>in Eastern Europe.</i>

30
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:09,566
<i>For security reasons,</i>
<i>the NOC list is divided in two.</i>

31
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:13,147
<i>The portion Golitsyn has</i>
<i>contains code names.</i>

32
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:18,786
<i>It is useless without its mate, which</i>
<i>matches the codes with true names.</i>

33
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:25,330
<i>It is this half Golitsyn plans to steal</i>
<i>at an embassy reception tomorrow.</i>

34
00:05:25,544 --> 00:05:30,705
<i>Your mission, should you choose to</i>
<i>accept it, is to obtain proof of the theft.</i>

35
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:35,552
<i>Shadow Golitsyn to his buyer</i>
<i>and apprehend them both.</i>

36
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:39,632
<i>I've dispatched a team</i>
<i>selected from your group.</i>

37
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:44,893
<i>Sarah Davies is undercover now. Jack</i>
<i>Harmon can hack into their system.</i>

38
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:50,102
<i>Hannah Williams will do surveillance.</i>
<i>Your wife, Claire, will cover transport.</i>

39
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:54,366
<i>And Ethan Hunt</i>
<i>will be your point man, as usual.</i>

40
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:58,905
<i>He is now in Kiev and</i>
<i>will rendezvous with you in Prague.</i>

41
00:05:59,122 --> 00:06:03,618
<i>Should any member of your IM force</i>
<i>be caught or killed, -

42
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:07,834
<i>- the Secretary will disavow</i>
<i>all knowledge of your actions.</i>

43
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:12,592
<i>This tape will self-destruct</i>
<i>in five seconds. Good luck, Jim.</i>

44
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:37,619
A very straightforward objective.

45
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,327
We photograph Golitsyn stealing the
NOC list, follow him to his buyer, -

46
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:47,669
- apprehend both of them.
Now, here's the plot. Ethan...

47
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:53,126
You go into the embassy in character,
during a party. Hide in plain sight.

48
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:56,680
- You game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

49
00:06:56,892 --> 00:07:02,184
Sarah, you're there as the embassy's
Washington visitors' liaison.

50
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,316
You and Ethan will run the game.

51
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:11,151
- I haven't a thing to wear.
- Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

52
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:19,992
Mark Golitsyn and hand him off
to Hannah. Hannah, you stay on him.

53
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:25,501
Jack, fingerprint security is accessed
through the elevator shaft here.

54
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:32,085
- So I guess I'm not wearing my tux.
- Open, close, get out.

55
00:07:32,305 --> 00:07:35,591
Claire, you're in the vehicle.

56
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:41,480
Hannah will join you as Golitsyn
goes exterior. You two stay on him.

57
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:45,475
If I call "abort",
everybody walk away immediately.

58
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:49,823
Regroup here at 4:00 a.m.

59
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:53,403
Any questions?

60
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:59,042
Can we get a cappuccino machine?
I don't know what you call this.

61
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:03,713
- I call it cruel and unusual.
- I made that coffee.

62
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:08,170
Is it possible that it's worse
than the sludge you made in Kiev?

63
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:14,471
- Hey, take it easy on my wife's coffee.
- We missed you in Kiev, Jim.

64
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:19,228
- Off on a cushy recruiting assignment?
- Did they put you at the Plaza?

65
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,227
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

66
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:27,235
- Punishing! 24-hour room service.
- Chauffeured cars.

67
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:30,236
He's getting soft in his old age.

68
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:34,746
Okay, listen. If that list
gets out into the open, -

69
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:39,915
- the names of our agents will be
up for grabs to the highest bidders.

70
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:47,461
Terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords.
Everyone who wants to get rid of us.

71
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,463
If they're exposed, they'll be executed.

72
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:59,185
I'll run the whole show from here.
Let's punch out the details.

73
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,901
There's a camera built into the bridge.
It transmits what you see back here.

74
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:13,372
Can you hear me?
No, you need an earpiece.

75
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:21,995
You have lovely eyes...
Can you hear me now?

76
00:09:22,215 --> 00:09:27,376
If he has a car waiting, and he rolls,
stay with him no matter what.

77
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:34,477
- You should check out these streets.
- What do you think I've been doing?

78
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:38,271
- We're using Waltzer?
- He's our guy.

79
00:09:38,483 --> 00:09:43,644
- Isn't he chairing a hearing?
- Not this week.

80
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:49,950
This week he's fly-fishing in County
Kildare with one of our Irish guides.

81
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:54,077
And he won't be back anytime soon.

82
00:09:57,795 --> 00:10:02,174
<i>Senator, it sounds as if</i>
<i>you want to lead the kind of charge -

83
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:09,799
<i>- that Sen. Church led in the 70's, and</i>
<i>destroy the US's intelligence capability.</i>

84
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:14,809
<i>I want to know who they are and how</i>
<i>they're spending the taxpayers'money.</i>

85
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:18,606
<i>This is still a democracy.</i>

86
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:25,484
Stick of gum, right?
No. Red light, green light.

87
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,696
You have a lock you can't pick,
you mash them together...

88
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:36,075
<i>Hasta</i> lasagne, don't get any on ya'.
You'll have about five seconds.

89
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:41,049
Just don't chew it.

90
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:22,131
Ethan, Jack's inside.
Let's go.

91
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,263
<i>How do you do, Senator?</i>
<i>How was the opera?</i>

92
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:37,436
- It was boring.
- Let me see if I can steer you through.

93
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:55,327
- Windows open by 2300.
- Mr Brandl, the mayor, and Mrs Brandl.

94
00:11:55,547 --> 00:12:00,506
Senator,
I bet you don't remember me, do you?

95
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,927
- Of course. How are you, Ms Norman?
- He's in pocket, on the stairway.

96
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,766
Mr Golitsyn, nice to see you.

97
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,025
Hannah.

98
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,574
<i>Pull the shade.</i>

99
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:35,213
<i>Sarah, mark the package</i>
<i>and go to two.</i>

100
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:45,849
Your advance team said you'd like
a tour of the facility. This way.

101
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,939
Oh, great.

102
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:05,112
...which leads to the Denied Area,
the only limited access area here.

103
00:13:29,773 --> 00:13:33,024
Governor's in position now.

104
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:47,497
- Can I help you?
- As you can see, there's surveillance.

105
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,624
I'm sorry,
I know it's in here somewhere.

106
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,875
Sergeant, why are you not in uniform?

107
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:58,877
<i>We've been ordered</i>
<i>to wear civilian clothes, sir.</i>

108
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:04,345
Be right back.

109
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:11,560
- Do you have a Jack on your staff?
<i>- I believe we did.</i>

110
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:17,116
An unreliable fellow, as I recall.
Constantly late and behind in his work.

111
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:26,247
<i>We were forced to tie him to a horse</i>
<i>and drag him around my barn.</i>

112
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:28,661
I'm working on it.

113
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:46,355
Sorry.
Thank you. Have a nice evening.

114
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:01,536
That date with Sarah is definitely off.

115
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,106
Higher.

116
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:39,491
He's heading to the Denied Area.

117
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:46,159
Get moving, Ethan. He's rolling to you.

118
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:58,224
Jack...

119
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:02,970
Jack, we're in position here.

120
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:05,680
I didn't touch it.

121
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:12,693
- What about my coat? I'll freeze.
- Jack, open the doors.

122
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:24,201
He's in the box, Ethan.

123
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,418
- We'll take his exit. Open these doors.
- I don't have it.

124
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:32,837
I'm opening the doors. Go under.

125
00:17:14,974 --> 00:17:18,474
- He's got it.
- All right.

126
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:23,313
- I saved your ass again, Jack.
- Such a nice ass.

127
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:27,523
- And a lonely ass.
- Transport in five minutes.

128
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:17,535
Jack, we're in position. Open the doors
and let the package roll.

129
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:23,041
Stairway, you're wrapped.
Go to transport.

130
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,093
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

131
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:44,983
I don't have control, Jack.
Cut the power.

132
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:51,609
- Cut the power.
- Come on, Jack.

133
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:03,582
Jack...

134
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:09,341
Jack...
Jack?

135
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:14,883
<i>- Jack, do you copy?</i>
- Man down, Ethan.

136
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:17,773
<i>Man down.</i>

137
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:41,297
Ethan, stay where you are.
I'm coming to you.

138
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:59,731
The package is out in the open.

139
00:20:02,196 --> 00:20:06,574
- Jim, he's in the open.
- En route.

140
00:20:27,014 --> 00:20:29,588
Jim, he's in the open.

141
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:34,053
Jim, the package is in the open.

142
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:41,604
I've got a shadow.
I can't lose him. Abort!

143
00:20:41,822 --> 00:20:45,273
Ethan, he's out of pocket.

144
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:52,529
- I can't do that.
- We're being ambushed. Abort!

145
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:58,124
- Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.
<i>- No, dammit, I said abort!</i>

146
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:12,306
- Eye on the package. Jim, I'm coming.
- Jim gave an abort.

147
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:18,395
We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me? Now go!

148
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:54,228
- Where are you?
- 200 yards from the bridge.

149
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:57,063
<i>They're covering the frequency.</i>

150
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:01,145
<i>Cut all radio communication.</i>

151
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,382
<i>Ethan...</i>

152
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:04,217
Sarah, abort.
Repeat: Abort!

153
00:23:07,228 --> 00:23:10,063
Abort! Do you read me?

154
00:23:14,486 --> 00:23:16,858
Sarah...

155
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:52,267
Oh my God!

156
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,142
<i>- Satcom 7.</i>
- Central Europe, unsecured.

157
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:48,603
<i>- Designator?</i>
- Bravo, echo, one, one.

158
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:55,448
<i>- This is Kittridge.</i>
- Go secure.

159
00:25:56,911 --> 00:26:00,908
This is Ethan Hunt. They're dead.

160
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:05,620
<i>- Who's dead?</i>
- My team. My team is dead!

161
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:12,089
Golitsyn's gone. They knew
we were coming. The disk is gone.

162
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:17,546
<i>- Are you intact?</i>
- The list is in the open!

163
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:23,058
<i>Letâ€™s just bring you in safely,</i>
<i>then we'll worry about that.</i>

164
00:26:23,272 --> 00:26:28,434
<i>- Were you followed?</i>
- I don't think so.

165
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:31,820
<i>Don't think. Be sure.</i>
<i>Are you clean?</i>

166
00:26:32,032 --> 00:26:34,108
Yes.

167
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:39,071
<i>Location Green, one hour.</i>
<i>I'll be there myself.</i>

168
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:42,291
- You're in Prague?
<i>- One hour.</i>

169
00:27:37,728 --> 00:27:43,564
I... I can't tell you how sorry I am.

170
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:48,688
I know how much Jim,
in particular, meant to you.

171
00:27:48,907 --> 00:27:54,363
- Personally as well as professionally.
- Yeah...

172
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:02,664
Here's a passport and visa. Usual drill.

173
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,964
We'll work the exfiltration
through Canada -

174
00:28:06,175 --> 00:28:10,255
- and throw the Prague police a bone,
toss them a few suspects.

175
00:28:14,935 --> 00:28:20,605
- You follow me?
- Yeah, I follow you.

176
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:27,607
- We've lost enough agents for tonight.
- You mean, <i>I have.

177
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:34,954
- You're bent on blaming yourself.
- Who else is left?

178
00:28:36,874 --> 00:28:40,410
Yeah, I see your point.

179
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:48,793
- Why was there another team?
- What?

180
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:53,345
The IMF agents at the embassy.

181
00:28:55,228 --> 00:28:58,727
I don't quite follow you.

182
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:03,193
Then follow me around the room.

183
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:08,232
The drunk Russians on
the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock.

184
00:29:09,285 --> 00:29:15,786
The couple waltzing around me,
the waiter standing behind Hannah.

185
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,663
Bow tie at 12 o'clock.
The other IMF team.

186
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:23,835
You're worried about me. Why?

187
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:30,555
For two years
we've been spotting a blowback -

188
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:34,301
- in IMF operations.
We have a penetration.

189
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,645
We've decoded an Internet message
from a Czech we know as "Max".

190
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:43,109
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

191
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:50,867
Max has a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

192
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:57,533
This time he got on the inside,
in a position to buy our NOC list.

193
00:29:57,753 --> 00:30:03,792
An operation he called "Job 3-14". He
thought Golitsyn was doing it tonight.

194
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:11,722
- The list he stole was a decoy.
- That's correct.

195
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:16,645
The actual list is secure at Langley.
Golitsyn was one of ours.

196
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:24,104
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

197
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:33,658
- The whole operation was a mole hunt.
- Yeah.

198
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:39,370
The mole's deep inside.

199
00:30:40,425 --> 00:30:45,300
And like you said...

200
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:48,218
...you survived.

201
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,807
I want to show you something.

202
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:59,856
Since your father's death, your
family's farm has been in receivership.

203
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,021
Suddenly, they have 120 grand
in the bank.

204
00:31:04,242 --> 00:31:08,026
The illness was supposed to have
wiped out that account.

205
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:13,916
Dying slowly in America can be
a very expensive proposition.

206
00:31:15,837 --> 00:31:22,090
So why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

207
00:31:25,014 --> 00:31:29,889
- I can understand you're very upset.
- You've never seen me very upset.

208
00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:32,559
Enough is enough.

209
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:37,399
You've bribed and killed,
using loyalties on the inside.

210
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:42,356
You want to shake hands with the
devil? Fine, but you'll do it in hell.

211
00:33:42,913 --> 00:33:46,329
Money, money...
Where's the damn money?

212
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:18,905
<i>We've decoded an Internet message</i>
<i>from a Czech we know as "Max".</i>

213
00:34:19,118 --> 00:34:25,038
<i>He got in a position to buy our NOC</i>
<i>list. An operation he called "Job 3-14".</i>

214
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:24,975
Job 3:14...

215
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:43,581
"...asleep and at rest with kings
and counsellors of the earth..."

216
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:49,128
You son of a bitch.

217
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:30,904
Ethan...

218
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:36,573
What are you doing?
I needed you.

219
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:39,993
On the bridge.

220
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,579
But you weren't there.

221
00:37:58,312 --> 00:38:03,057
- Don't move.
- Ethan...

222
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:07,819
It's okay. Just calm down.
It's Claire.

223
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:13,400
- You were in the car.
- No, I wasn't.

224
00:38:15,455 --> 00:38:20,795
- I heard on the radio...
- I saw you, you were in the car.

225
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:26,294
No, I got out of the car. I ran to
the bridge. He said someone was...

226
00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:31,006
Don't give me that. I was on the bridge.
There was nobody there.

227
00:38:31,223 --> 00:38:36,977
- What happened to Jim?
- Wake up! Jim's dead! They're all dead!

228
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:48,897
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead...

229
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:54,946
Take off your coat.

230
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:13,135
I walked away. He said abort.
I just walked away.

231
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:20,101
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you? Did they send you?

232
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:23,936
No one sent me.

233
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:29,861
We were supposed to be back here
at four o'clock if we abort.

234
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:34,704
0400. Four a.m. Four o'clock.
It's four o'clock.

235
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:38,866
If we abort... four a.m.

236
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:01,936
I've been disavowed.

237
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,777
They actually think
I killed Jim and everyone else.

238
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:20,624
Somehow, $100,000 finds its way
into my parents' bank account.

239
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:26,380
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole,
employed by an arms dealer, Max, -

240
00:40:26,596 --> 00:40:31,058
- for the last two years,
to get him our NOC list.

241
00:40:32,895 --> 00:40:38,056
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to get it for him.

242
00:40:38,276 --> 00:40:42,571
Ethan, you're not making any sense.

243
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:47,443
Whoever the mole is,
he goes by the name of Job.

244
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:52,904
I can't find him, but if he knows
I have the NOC list, he'll find me.

245
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:58,167
I'm going to go in and tell Kittridge
you have nothing to do with this.

246
00:40:58,381 --> 00:41:04,336
Claire, if you're not dead,
he'll assume you're with me.

247
00:41:19,862 --> 00:41:23,196
The message is for Job.

248
00:41:23,408 --> 00:41:26,907
That's right.
And I'm going to answer it.

249
00:41:50,562 --> 00:41:55,271
Excuse me,
could I trouble you for a match?

250
00:42:11,543 --> 00:42:14,829
Remove your hat, please.

251
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:20,376
- Why?
- You wish to meet Max?

252
00:42:20,594 --> 00:42:23,797
The price of admission.

253
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:39,069
- I thought I was going to see Max.
- You misunderstood. No one sees Max.

254
00:42:39,281 --> 00:42:45,652
- Then why the hell am I here?
- So he can hear what you have to say.

255
00:42:45,872 --> 00:42:49,490
I don't communicate well
through a shroud.

256
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:55,665
If Max doesn't like what you say,
you'll be wearing it indefinitely.

257
00:42:57,176 --> 00:43:00,758
I'm willing to take the chance.

258
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:07,217
Very well.

259
00:43:10,315 --> 00:43:14,775
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

260
00:43:14,986 --> 00:43:18,272
I need $150,000.

261
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:22,150
Really?

262
00:43:24,788 --> 00:43:30,412
And you thought if you simply
showed up, I might give it to you?

263
00:43:30,628 --> 00:43:34,377
Why not? You gave Job 125.

264
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:41,337
The penny drops. You are not Job.

265
00:43:43,266 --> 00:43:48,178
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

266
00:43:48,397 --> 00:43:54,483
Its tone was aggressive but playful.
Job is not playful.

267
00:43:56,072 --> 00:44:01,529
- So you are something of a paradox.
- Well, that depends.

268
00:44:01,745 --> 00:44:05,659
- On what?
- Whether you like a paradox.

269
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:13,249
- I want $150,000 today.
- That's quite out of the question.

270
00:44:15,468 --> 00:44:19,217
The disk Job sold you is worthless.

271
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:23,642
It's bait. Part of an internal mole hunt.

272
00:44:27,982 --> 00:44:31,931
And how might you know that?

273
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:36,067
Are you another company man?

274
00:44:36,282 --> 00:44:39,782
Like Job?

275
00:44:41,705 --> 00:44:45,572
We're asking about you.

276
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:50,501
I'm NOC. Was...
Now disavowed.

277
00:44:51,674 --> 00:44:56,502
- Why, may I ask?
- That's what I want to ask Job.

278
00:44:56,721 --> 00:45:01,963
I don't know Job
any more than Job knows me.

279
00:45:02,185 --> 00:45:06,017
You could arrange an introduction.

280
00:45:06,231 --> 00:45:10,727
- Why should I?
- I can deliver the actual NOC list.

281
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:17,113
Your list is worthless, and it's probably
equipped with a homing device.

282
00:45:21,122 --> 00:45:27,374
Boot it up. In 10 minutes you'll have the
CIA hopping around you like rabbits.

283
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:37,462
It's easy to say it's worthless if I can't
look at it to see if it's worthless.

284
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:43,186
- Not a tenable position, sir.
- Okay, use it.

285
00:45:43,395 --> 00:45:47,893
But I'd suggest you pack first.

286
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:08,166
- 26-27. So far, so good.
- Not so good for you, my friend.

287
00:46:08,381 --> 00:46:12,296
I'd say you've got about two minutes.

288
00:46:42,918 --> 00:46:48,126
- 32 and 33.
- Doesn't mean it's a signal.

289
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,341
44 and 45.

290
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:51,319
The man's gone black, Barnes.
He's under until he decides to surface.

291
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:57,952
- We can cut off his transportation.
- What can we do, Barnes?

292
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:02,294
Put a guy at the airport?
How many identities does Hunt have?

293
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:06,632
How many times
has he slipped past customs?

294
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:11,670
These guys are trained to be ghosts.
We taught them!

295
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:15,258
What do you suggest?

296
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:19,094
Let's make him come to us.

297
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:25,851
You find something that's personally
important to him and you squeeze.

298
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:35,496
GÃ¼nther will never let me
have one of his apartments again.

299
00:48:36,624 --> 00:48:41,998
- Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
- Thanks, Max.

300
00:48:43,256 --> 00:48:46,423
Or is it Maxine?

301
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:50,929
I don't have to tell you what a comfort
anonymity is in my profession.

302
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:55,558
It's like a warm blanket.

303
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:04,147
My deal with Job was subject to
a successful boot scan. The deal's off.

304
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,403
- What was your deal with Job?
- Six million dollars.

305
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:15,531
I'll give you the same, for the
complete list, not just Eastern Europe.

306
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:19,700
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

307
00:49:19,921 --> 00:49:27,003
10 million, in negotiable US Treasury
certificates, coupons attached.

308
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,138
And one more thing...

309
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:35,343
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.

310
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:58,497
- Max made a deal with you?
- I deliver the list, Max delivers Job.

311
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:05,085
We've 75 rounds for the Beretta,
but only 20 for the Sig-Sauer.

312
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:09,218
One pair of Visco glasses.

313
00:50:09,432 --> 00:50:12,350
Plenty of passports...

314
00:50:15,897 --> 00:50:22,435
Well, you said it yourself.
If I'm not dead, I'm with you.

315
00:50:24,073 --> 00:50:27,822
- Are you sure?
- Jim was my husband.

316
00:50:28,035 --> 00:50:32,744
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

317
00:50:32,957 --> 00:50:38,996
- We need help. They'll have to be local.
- What kind of help?

318
00:51:13,376 --> 00:51:17,919
Simple game. Four players.

319
00:51:18,131 --> 00:51:22,544
Exfil opens the pocket,
cyber ops lifts the wallet.

320
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:27,091
- Bank?
- IMF mainframe.

321
00:51:27,308 --> 00:51:31,934
- Where exactly is it?
- In Langley.

322
00:51:33,773 --> 00:51:37,723
In Langley?
The one in Virginia?

323
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:42,814
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?

324
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:46,532
- Is he serious?
- Always.

325
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:52,705
Why don't we drop by Fort Knox?

326
00:51:52,919 --> 00:51:57,166
I can fly a helicopter into the vault.

327
00:51:57,382 --> 00:52:01,296
It would be easier
than breaking into the CIA.

328
00:52:01,511 --> 00:52:06,506
- What kind of information is it?
- Profitable.

329
00:52:08,227 --> 00:52:11,311
Payment on delivery.

330
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:16,566
I don't know.
I just don't know.

331
00:52:18,028 --> 00:52:22,359
This doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

332
00:52:22,576 --> 00:52:27,072
What did they used to call you?
The Net Ranger?

333
00:52:27,289 --> 00:52:30,206
The only man to hack NATO Ghostcom.

334
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:35,958
There was never any evidence
that I had anything to do with that...

335
00:52:36,173 --> 00:52:39,625
...with that exceptional piece of work.

336
00:52:43,306 --> 00:52:48,811
You don't know what you're missing.
This is the Mt Everest of hacks.

337
00:52:49,021 --> 00:52:55,640
You're kidding yourselves. Even with
top of the line crypto, Stu 3's...

338
00:52:55,861 --> 00:53:00,987
- Krieger can get it. Right?
- It may take a little time.

339
00:53:01,201 --> 00:53:04,901
That's not what Claire says about you.

340
00:53:05,121 --> 00:53:09,249
Thinking Machine laptops.

341
00:53:09,459 --> 00:53:14,916
The 686 prototypes,
with the artificial intelligence Risc chip.

342
00:53:15,132 --> 00:53:17,919
24 hours.

343
00:53:18,135 --> 00:53:22,596
And I get to keep the equipment
when we're done.

344
00:53:22,806 --> 00:53:27,802
Luther,
I guess you're all out of excuses.

345
00:53:30,649 --> 00:53:34,598
Look, I just can't hack my way inside.

346
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:40,989
No modem access to a mainframe.
It's in what we call a "stand-alone".

347
00:53:41,202 --> 00:53:46,706
Which means I'd have to be
physically at the terminal.

348
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:50,784
Relax, it's much worse than you think.

349
00:53:51,004 --> 00:53:53,791
It's in a black vault lock-down.

350
00:53:54,007 --> 00:54:00,461
<i>The only person allowed in the room</i>
<i>has to pass through security checks.</i>

351
00:54:00,681 --> 00:54:06,138
<i>The first is a voiceprint identification</i>
<i>and a six-digit access code.</i>

352
00:54:08,731 --> 00:54:12,314
<i>This only gets him into the outer room.</i>

353
00:54:12,527 --> 00:54:16,275
<i>Next he has to pass a retinal scan.</i>

354
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:24,488
<i>And the intrusion countermeasures are</i>
<i>deactivated by an electronic key card.</i>

355
00:54:24,707 --> 00:54:28,241
Which we won't have.

356
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:35,627
<i>Inside the black vault, three systems</i>
<i>operate whenever the technician is out.</i>

357
00:54:35,844 --> 00:54:41,929
<i>The first is sound sensitive.</i>
<i>Anything above a whisper sets it off.</i>

358
00:54:42,142 --> 00:54:45,428
<i>The second system detects</i>
<i>any increase in temperature.</i>

359
00:54:45,646 --> 00:54:52,016
<i>The body heat of an intruder will trigger</i>
<i>it if the temperature rises one degree.</i>

360
00:54:56,825 --> 00:55:01,321
<i>That temperature is controlled</i>
<i>by the air conditioning duct, -

361
00:55:01,538 --> 00:55:04,990
<i>- 30 feet above the floor.</i>

362
00:55:05,209 --> 00:55:08,126
<i>That vent is guarded by a laser net.</i>

363
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:16,086
<i>The third system is on the floor</i>
<i>and is pressure sensitive.</i>

364
00:55:16,304 --> 00:55:20,633
<i>The slightest increase in weight</i>
<i>will trigger the alarm.</i>

365
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:26,889
<i>If any one of these systems is set off,</i>
<i>it will activate an automatic lock-down.</i>

366
00:55:27,107 --> 00:55:33,146
<i>Believe me when I tell you,</i>
<i>all three systems are state of the art.</i>

367
00:55:37,702 --> 00:55:40,906
And you really think we can do this?

368
00:55:42,249 --> 00:55:44,288
We're going to do it.

369
00:56:17,996 --> 00:56:20,747
Alarms in sectors 3, 7 and 12.

370
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:25,833
<i>- What sector's the air conditioning?</i>
<i>- 21. But there's no alarm in 21.</i>

371
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:38,056
<i>No one goes into any sector where the</i>
<i>alarm hasn't gone off, and it hasn't...</i>

372
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,478
<i>- It's gone off. Let's go.</i>
- Let's move.

373
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,447
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

374
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:06,211
21's through here.

375
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:16,259
- He's recruiting. For what purpose?
- Survival.

376
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:21,434
Too short-sighted. This guy initiates.
The question is, what does he want?

377
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:26,440
Where does he need to get it?
Barnes, what the hell is that noise?

378
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:32,406
- Fire alarm, Gene.
- Do we have to evacuate?

379
00:58:20,002 --> 00:58:22,837
Hey, where's the other guy?

380
00:58:26,216 --> 00:58:29,467
- Zero body count.
- We'll see.

381
01:00:03,071 --> 01:00:06,321
Hi, there.

382
01:01:05,221 --> 01:01:09,765
One, two, three.

383
01:01:09,976 --> 01:01:13,345
Toast, toast.

384
01:01:13,563 --> 01:01:19,021
<i>- Check.</i>
- Good. Okay, Luther, I'm going in.

385
01:01:19,237 --> 01:01:24,112
<i>Everest, man.</i>
<i>You ready to plant the flag?</i>

386
01:01:30,456 --> 01:01:35,796
- Damn.
- Krieger, from now on, total silence.

387
01:02:52,378 --> 01:02:55,083
He's rolling to you.

388
01:02:58,009 --> 01:03:01,793
- He's at the voiceprint corridor.
- William Donloe.

389
01:03:17,739 --> 01:03:19,897
Outer room.

390
01:03:23,453 --> 01:03:26,620
He's coming in the vault.

391
01:03:30,628 --> 01:03:33,166
Come on, move.

392
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:04,018
He's in the bathroom.

393
01:06:20,102 --> 01:06:22,474
A-W-9 -

394
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:25,144
<i>- 6-B-6.</i>

395
01:06:44,085 --> 01:06:45,996
Holy mother of God.

396
01:06:46,213 --> 01:06:48,336
<i>A NOC list.</i>

397
01:09:45,322 --> 01:09:48,656
He's at the vault.

398
01:10:00,422 --> 01:10:02,165
Four yellows.

399
01:10:05,177 --> 01:10:08,178
One red.

400
01:10:17,899 --> 01:10:20,272
Get moving.

401
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:25,563
Toast.

402
01:11:26,139 --> 01:11:28,465
Oh, my God.

403
01:11:44,242 --> 01:11:48,656
- It's for you.
- Kittridge.

404
01:12:11,896 --> 01:12:16,061
You and I know about this.
That's where it stops.

405
01:12:16,277 --> 01:12:19,776
- It never happened.
- What about him?

406
01:12:19,989 --> 01:12:24,366
I want him manning a radar tower
in Alaska by the end of the day.

407
01:13:04,578 --> 01:13:09,621
Are you contacting your buyer?
Ethan?

408
01:13:23,015 --> 01:13:25,767
Ethan?

409
01:13:27,144 --> 01:13:30,763
Oh, excuse me. "Mr Hunt".

410
01:13:39,032 --> 01:13:43,659
You're not going to any meeting
without me.

411
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:48,783
My contact is extremely shy.

412
01:13:49,002 --> 01:13:53,130
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders.

413
01:13:53,339 --> 01:13:56,673
- Not while I'm holding this.
- Krieger...

414
01:13:56,884 --> 01:13:59,007
<i>Shut up.</i>

415
01:14:03,475 --> 01:14:06,975
- You mean this?
- That's not the list.

416
01:14:07,187 --> 01:14:10,687
You've never seen this trick?

417
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:20,862
Where did it go?

418
01:14:23,913 --> 01:14:26,536
It's gone.

419
01:14:26,751 --> 01:14:30,333
- What?
- You... no?

420
01:14:37,345 --> 01:14:39,837
But not too far.

421
01:14:42,768 --> 01:14:45,555
I know what you're thinking.

422
01:14:45,771 --> 01:14:51,357
"In the computer room, I was up here
and he was down there."

423
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:57,529
"He was carrying two disks."

424
01:15:00,203 --> 01:15:04,450
- It's hard to keep track of these things.
- Where is it?

425
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:24,103
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the NOC list?

426
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:29,982
Try any sleight of hand with my money
and I'll cut your throat.

427
01:15:55,053 --> 01:15:59,432
<i>- On a cushy recruiting assignment?</i>
<i>- Did they put you at the Plaza?</i>

428
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:03,307
<i>Drake Hotel, Chicago.</i>

429
01:16:04,272 --> 01:16:07,189
I'm so sorry.

430
01:16:12,031 --> 01:16:15,696
Krieger was my call.

431
01:16:20,497 --> 01:16:24,448
I'm sorry, Ethan.

432
01:16:27,339 --> 01:16:31,087
We did what we had to do.

433
01:16:31,301 --> 01:16:34,966
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

434
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:16,211
Krieger did have the NOC list?

435
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:30,190
Hold on to it. If you knew what you were
getting into, you wouldn't have done it.

436
01:17:36,454 --> 01:17:40,119
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.

437
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:46,704
Exactly. That's your job tomorrow on
the train. Don't let it get out in the open.

438
01:17:53,347 --> 01:17:58,176
- What is the range of this thing?
- It's hard to tell. I'll have to be close.

439
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:08,646
<i>The unlikely setting, a farm in the</i>
<i>heartland of America, Wisconsin.</i>

440
01:18:08,864 --> 01:18:13,361
<i>Here, Federal agents found the brains</i>
<i>behind an international drug ring:</i>

441
01:18:13,578 --> 01:18:18,738
<i>Margaret Ethan Hunt and her</i>
<i>brother-in-law, Donald Hunt.</i>

442
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:24,333
<i>They were arrested this morning</i>
<i>in a major sting operation -

443
01:18:24,548 --> 01:18:30,302
<i>- designed to expose the</i>
<i>illegal manufacture of the drug "khat".</i>

444
01:18:30,512 --> 01:18:33,050
<i>- What we have here is a case...</i>
- Kittridge.

445
01:19:04,216 --> 01:19:06,588
I see you've been out visiting the folks.

446
01:19:06,802 --> 01:19:10,135
It's Hunt.
What do you need for a pinpoint?

447
01:19:10,347 --> 01:19:13,383
Been watching a little TV?

448
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:18,726
Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.

449
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:21,478
- He's in England.
- Get Ml5.

450
01:19:21,693 --> 01:19:26,271
My first order of business
after you come in -

451
01:19:26,489 --> 01:19:32,611
- is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped.

452
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:35,665
If you come in now, -

453
01:19:35,874 --> 01:19:40,786
<i>- we can play down</i>
<i>the charges against you, as well.</i>

454
01:19:41,005 --> 01:19:45,667
- Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
- Certainly, Ethan.

455
01:19:45,885 --> 01:19:48,174
If you're dealing with someone -

456
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:51,508
<i>- who's crushed, stabbed, -

457
01:19:51,725 --> 01:19:54,476
- shot and detonated -

458
01:19:54,687 --> 01:19:59,064
<i>- five members of his own IMF team, -

459
01:19:59,275 --> 01:20:04,566
- how devastated will you make him
by arresting Ma and Uncle Donald?

460
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:10,368
<i>I don't know, Ethan.</i>
<i>Why don't you tell me?</i>

461
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:15,541
Lost him.
We needed three more seconds.

462
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:19,583
He wanted us to know
he was in London.

463
01:20:32,101 --> 01:20:36,100
You're a hard man to catch up with.

464
01:20:42,946 --> 01:20:46,944
The next day I dragged myself
back to the safe house.

465
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:51,454
- I checked our aliases.
- And you picked us up in the States.

466
01:20:51,665 --> 01:20:54,998
But you'd gone,
and I could check just so many places.

467
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:59,706
Some European countries
don't computerise customs records.

468
01:20:59,923 --> 01:21:03,340
Once you turned up in England,
it was easy.

469
01:21:03,552 --> 01:21:09,388
- You know I like Liverpool St. Rentals.
- I showed them to you.

470
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,767
I remember.

471
01:21:12,978 --> 01:21:18,934
A doctor's got to look at that.
You can't sit up straight.

472
01:21:19,152 --> 01:21:26,448
I can sit up straight. I just can't
sit up straight very well. Sit down.

473
01:21:28,121 --> 01:21:32,996
Ethan... I saw who shot me.

474
01:21:33,209 --> 01:21:36,044
I saw the mole.

475
01:21:36,254 --> 01:21:39,873
- It was Kittridge.
- Kittridge...

476
01:21:40,092 --> 01:21:42,797
Kittridge, Ethan!

477
01:21:47,766 --> 01:21:52,393
Kittridge is the mole.
My God. Of course, you're right.

478
01:21:58,737 --> 01:22:03,399
He was at the embassy that night.

479
01:22:03,616 --> 01:22:07,947
First he took out Jack, at the elevator.

480
01:22:15,838 --> 01:22:19,457
He shot you on the bridge.

481
01:23:02,847 --> 01:23:07,675
He must have had back-up to take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

482
01:23:24,955 --> 01:23:28,905
How did he do Hannah?

483
01:23:51,942 --> 01:23:55,643
No, he could've done Hannah himself.

484
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:26,680
Why, Jim?
Why?

485
01:24:29,774 --> 01:24:35,113
When you think about it,
it was inevitable. No more Cold War.

486
01:24:35,322 --> 01:24:41,490
No more secrets to keep
from everyone but yourself.

487
01:24:41,703 --> 01:24:48,039
Then suddenly the President is running
the country without your permission.

488
01:24:48,252 --> 01:24:54,338
The son of a bitch, how dare he?
And you realise it's over.

489
01:24:54,550 --> 01:25:00,305
You're obsolete hardware, with
a lousy marriage and 62 grand a year.

490
01:25:02,351 --> 01:25:07,392
Kittridge. We'll go after
the no-good son of a bitch, big time.

491
01:25:12,445 --> 01:25:16,988
We won't have to.
He'll come after us.

492
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:22,325
- What's going to make him do that?
- What he didn't get in Prague.

493
01:25:22,539 --> 01:25:25,956
The NOC list.

494
01:25:26,168 --> 01:25:29,205
Jesus, Ethan.

495
01:25:29,422 --> 01:25:32,873
Good for you.

496
01:25:33,843 --> 01:25:41,009
- We meet tomorrow, the TGV to Paris.
- Tight security. No guns. Real plus.

497
01:25:41,226 --> 01:25:46,102
I deliver the NOC list to Max,
Max delivers Job to me.

498
01:25:46,314 --> 01:25:51,939
Claire and Luther will be on the train.
Krieger will have a helicopter in Paris.

499
01:25:55,241 --> 01:25:57,946
Jim?

500
01:26:05,711 --> 01:26:09,127
I was in a cafe, waiting for you...

501
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:13,040
...and there she was.

502
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:18,967
Standing in the rain, alive and beautiful,
thinking I'm dead and gone.

503
01:26:22,937 --> 01:26:27,979
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me, to keep going.

504
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:36,357
She can't know about me. No one can.
Not till this is over.

505
01:26:36,577 --> 01:26:42,332
- You're probably right.
- There's too much at stake.

506
01:26:42,542 --> 01:26:47,916
Once we leave the safe house,
you get in there and crash.

507
01:26:48,131 --> 01:26:52,129
- I'll call from Paris.
- You got it.

508
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:18,155
What happened?

509
01:27:20,457 --> 01:27:24,503
I sent the message to Max.

510
01:27:26,756 --> 01:27:30,505
We're on for tomorrow.

511
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:38,721
Okay.

512
01:27:47,988 --> 01:27:50,561
Come here.

513
01:28:31,284 --> 01:28:34,867
- What's this?
- Incoming for you.

514
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:38,912
X-ray's clean. Non-explosive.

515
01:28:49,303 --> 01:28:52,506
Gene.

516
01:28:55,727 --> 01:29:00,188
How long to the London terminus?
We've got 10 minutes. Move!

517
01:29:38,898 --> 01:29:42,149
<i>- Give me Max.</i>
- It's him.

518
01:29:45,864 --> 01:29:50,823
- This was not what we discussed.
<i>- My apologies. It couldn't be helped.</i>

519
01:29:51,037 --> 01:29:54,370
<i>You'll find the disk under your seat.</i>

520
01:30:29,453 --> 01:30:36,120
Dear boy, I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

521
01:30:36,335 --> 01:30:41,840
<i>- Not if you tell me where the money is.</i>
- The mere chance is worth 10 million.

522
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:47,969
Baggage car, rack 3,
silver briefcase, combination 3-1-4.

523
01:30:48,181 --> 01:30:53,686
<i>- What about Job?</i>
- I wouldn't worry, he'll find you.

524
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:14,871
- What's the matter?
- It's not transmitting.

525
01:31:15,085 --> 01:31:20,163
We've got to get this through
before we hit the tunnel.

526
01:31:32,146 --> 01:31:37,057
- What's the problem?
- "Connection denied."

527
01:31:37,276 --> 01:31:41,736
- Did you check the batteries?
- I always check the batteries.

528
01:31:41,947 --> 01:31:45,198
Run it through from the top.

529
01:31:47,579 --> 01:31:50,995
We don't know what Max looks like.

530
01:31:51,207 --> 01:31:57,328
If he's got that list, he'll want
to check it. That means laptops.

531
01:32:08,309 --> 01:32:11,145
Excuse me, sir. Your telephone.

532
01:32:17,819 --> 01:32:23,158
- Is everything all right?
- It's working.

533
01:32:34,462 --> 01:32:36,620
He's in the baggage car.

534
01:32:37,925 --> 01:32:44,639
- Ethan, Kittridge is on the train.
<i>- I'll meet you in the baggage car.</i>

535
01:33:01,366 --> 01:33:03,443
Barnes.

536
01:33:40,575 --> 01:33:45,403
Ethan's right behind me.
Listen, Jim...

537
01:33:45,622 --> 01:33:48,410
Is it such a good idea to kill him?

538
01:33:52,379 --> 01:33:55,049
Kittridge is here.

539
01:33:57,886 --> 01:34:01,930
We take the money,
Ethan takes the blame.

540
01:34:04,392 --> 01:34:07,892
No one else has seen you alive.

541
01:34:09,106 --> 01:34:11,893
No one will believe him.

542
01:34:39,138 --> 01:34:44,974
Of course, I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Claire.

543
01:34:47,063 --> 01:34:52,687
- Ethan.
- Yes, Ethan Hunt. You remember him.

544
01:34:55,864 --> 01:35:00,692
- You knew about Jim?
- Of course.

545
01:35:00,911 --> 01:35:05,408
<i>When</i> he knew is a good question.
Mind telling me, Ethan?

546
01:35:05,625 --> 01:35:08,911
Before or after I showed up in London?

547
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:14,709
Before London. After you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

548
01:35:16,262 --> 01:35:19,428
They stamped it, didn't they?
Damned Gideons.

549
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:24,717
Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why?

550
01:35:24,937 --> 01:35:29,849
Why the masquerade?
Why take the risk?

551
01:35:30,068 --> 01:35:34,481
You've asked the question...
and you are the answer.

552
01:35:34,698 --> 01:35:39,739
- I knew about Jim.
- But he didn't know about you.

553
01:35:39,953 --> 01:35:45,245
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

554
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:49,042
But I was confident,
having tasted the goods.

555
01:35:51,215 --> 01:35:55,510
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife."

556
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:02,968
- Let's just get the money and get out.
- Yes, let's get the money.

557
01:36:03,187 --> 01:36:07,137
Ethan, the money.

558
01:36:08,651 --> 01:36:12,317
Give her the money.

559
01:36:13,823 --> 01:36:17,323
You've earned it.

560
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,876
- All 10 million.
- Claire was wrong about one thing.

561
01:36:28,089 --> 01:36:31,089
Oh, what's that?

562
01:36:50,405 --> 01:36:53,904
Good morning, Mr Phelps.

563
01:36:54,117 --> 01:36:57,949
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

564
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:03,953
- You son of a bitch.
- It's over, Jim.

565
01:37:10,134 --> 01:37:13,753
- Don't. Don't, Jim.
- "Don't, Jim"?

566
01:40:29,348 --> 01:40:35,434
No, he's in the tunnel.
He'll crash into us! Accelerate!

567
01:42:37,903 --> 01:42:41,653
Red light... green light.

568
01:43:34,423 --> 01:43:38,373
I think this is what you're looking for.

569
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:45,512
Hello, Max.

570
01:43:45,726 --> 01:43:51,350
My lawyers will have a field day with it.
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict...

571
01:43:51,566 --> 01:43:55,730
Maybe we'll just leave the courts
out of this one.

572
01:43:57,614 --> 01:44:02,343
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

573
01:44:02,564 --> 01:44:07,454
<i>In a freak accident, a helicopter</i>
<i>lost altitude, veered into a tunnel, -

574
01:44:07,589 --> 01:44:11,498
<i>- and collided with a high-speed train.</i>

575
01:44:11,712 --> 01:44:17,052
<i>The pilot was killed,</i>
<i>but no one on the train was hurt...</i>

576
01:44:19,971 --> 01:44:23,950
- You call your folks? How do they feel?
- About what?

577
01:44:24,309 --> 01:44:30,393
The Justice Department apology,
VIP treatment, the whole nine yards.

578
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:38,278
My mom didn't know how the DEA
mistook them for drug smugglers.

579
01:44:41,203 --> 01:44:45,336
- Cheers.
- To you, Luther.

580
01:44:45,713 --> 01:44:50,249
- And being off the disavowed list.
- Hey, I'm the flavour of the month.

581
01:44:52,506 --> 01:44:55,122
Why don't you come back with me?

582
01:44:56,928 --> 01:45:00,795
I just don't know why
I'd be doing it.

583
01:45:03,309 --> 01:45:09,025
I've got to catch my flight...
How does it feel to be a solid citizen?

584
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:17,277
Man, I don't know.
I'm going to miss being disreputable.

585
01:45:17,491 --> 01:45:22,783
If it makes you feel any better,
I'll always think of you that way.

586
01:45:33,509 --> 01:45:35,747
Excuse me, Mr Hunt.

587
01:45:36,929 --> 01:45:39,045
Would you like to watch a movie?

588
01:45:40,263 --> 01:45:43,553
No, thank you.

589
01:45:44,248 --> 01:45:47,303
Would you consider the cinema
of the Caribbean?

590
01:45:49,561 --> 01:45:51,244
Aruba, perhaps.
