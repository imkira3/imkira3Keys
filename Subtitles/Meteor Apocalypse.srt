00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:38,694
Looks good.
All silos operational.

4
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:40,174
Ready for phase 3 deployment.

5
00:00:45,614 --> 00:00:49,140
Trident I, II and III

6
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:51,533
burners are go.
Ready for deployment.

7
00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:58,366
Verifying command...

8
00:00:58,453 --> 00:01:00,368
Verifying Naval Command...

00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:02,718
SSBN Ohio fleet are go.

00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:04,111
Gold crew reporting
operationally

00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,721
configured Trident II
SLBM array.

12
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:08,289
Verifying flight path
analysis...

13
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:10,552
Flight path analysis complete.

14
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:12,032
The comet's trajectory is...

15
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,033
Go for deployment?

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,904
We are go for deployment.

17
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,517
Awaiting command.

18
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:21,476
STRATCOM on standby, sir,
awaiting command.

19
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:23,478
{\an8}<i>This is the president.
Is everyone alright?</i>

20
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:25,263
{\an8}<i>- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.</i>

21
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,916
{\an8}<i>- Mr. President,</i>

22
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,962
{\an8}<i>we've spoken
to Presidents Lee Zhang,</i>

23
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:31,007
{\an8}<i>Todorov, and Rencilier.</i>

24
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:34,010
{\an8}<i>Prime Minister Bennett has
also agreed to the initiative.</i>

25
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:36,100
- {\an8}<i>The I.A.E.
- A confirms compliance.</i>

26
00:01:36,187 --> 00:01:38,624
{\an8}<i>This is all we can do.</i>

27
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:40,452
{\an8}<i>This is a high price
to pay for disarmament.</i>

28
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,108
{\an8}<i>Are you sure this will work?</i>

29
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:46,066
{\an8}<i>We've run countless simulations.</i>

30
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:47,546
{\an8}<i>At this point,
it's just a matter</i>

31
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,156
{\an8}<i>of probabilities...</i>

32
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,984
{\an8}<i>The force of these
nuclear warheads</i>

33
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:53,378
{\an8}<i>should be enough to ensure
sufficient disintegration,</i>

34
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:55,902
{\an8}<i>and the explosion
should redirect</i>

35
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:57,469
{\an8}<i>any remaining debris.</i>

36
00:01:57,556 --> 00:01:59,906
{\an8}<i>What happens if it doesn't work?</i>

37
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:01,473
{\an8}<i>We've already put
the local disaster</i>

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,041
{\an8}<i>response teams on alert.</i>

39
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:07,392
{\an8}<i>Let's do it.</i>

40
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,742
{\an8}<i>Initiate launch sequence.</i>

41
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:18,925
Launch sequence initiated.

42
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,430
{\an8}<i>Mr. President.
There's a problem.</i>

43
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:47,736
{\an8}<i>Did we hit?</i>

44
00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:49,303
Yes sir.

45
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,740
But the blast created debris,
meteorites, sir,

46
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:53,612
and all of them are heading
towards Earth.

47
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:13,153
This was so much fun.

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,589
Thank you so much for coming.

49
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:15,938
Of course. Please tell us about

50
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:17,505
the couples' luncheon tomorrow.

51
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:19,353
I will do that Heidi.
I promise I'll call you.

52
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:21,030
And e-mail me
the prayer chain list!

53
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,424
I will e-mail you.
Goodnight ladies.

54
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:24,951
- Goodnight
- I'll see you next week!

55
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:26,906
Don't forget, Second Timothy!

56
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,174
Okay...

57
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:36,959
Mom, I need help.

58
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:39,397
It's a very nice solar
system, honey.

59
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:42,443
You did a great job.

60
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,578
That supposed to be...
Mercury? Mmm...

61
00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:50,775
What do you think your dad's
doing right now?

62
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:55,717
Come on!

63
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,038
- Dad?
- Yeah?

64
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,214
I need help with my
Solar System project.

65
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:17,391
Not right now, honey.

66
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:19,741
David...

67
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:22,004
Kate, I'd like to get
this done before they start

68
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,398
the water rationing.

69
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:26,139
Maybe I should do it.

70
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:27,575
Unless you got over
your vertigo.

71
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:30,404
Very funny. I got it. Thank you.

72
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:31,753
David, come on.

73
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,755
Ali, honey! Alison!

74
00:04:33,842 --> 00:04:36,280
Listen, as soon as I'm
finished here, I'll come

75
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:39,979
inside and I'll work with you
on your Solar project. Ok?

76
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:43,243
I promise.

77
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,204
Al, honey... Pinky swear?

78
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:53,035
Dad, I'm twelve.

79
00:04:53,122 --> 00:04:54,994
Come on!

80
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:58,302
Good.

81
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,566
Okay?

82
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:29,811
This will be better
if I did this in daylight

83
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:33,598
where I have a better chance
of not getting hurt.

84
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:34,903
That's right.

85
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,668
Did you feel that?

86
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:03,497
It's an earthquake

87
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:08,459
I saw this big flash
over by the Valley of Fire.

88
00:06:11,026 --> 00:06:14,421
It's just heat lightning
Alison. Go to bed.

89
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:17,293
Can I go online?

90
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:19,818
It's two o'clock in the
morning Alison! Go to sleep.

91
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:21,733
It's fine honey.

92
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:28,435
We should be cultivating
her interests.

93
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,394
She's taking after you,
you know.

94
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:32,047
Ah, let's hope not.

95
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,424
It's probably Mauricio.

96
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:03,078
Ah. I Bet we got
a turbidity flag 'cause

97
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:06,430
of the earthquake... Hello?

98
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:09,041
{\an8}<i>David...
I need you to come in...</i>

99
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,738
Mark?

100
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:13,741
{\an8}<i>Come now.</i>

101
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:17,528
Mark? Mark, what's wrong?

102
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:21,880
I gotta go in to work.

103
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,403
Why did you bother
switching to days

104
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,274
when you're on call
seven nights a week?

105
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,363
It's my job, Kate.
What do you want me to do?

106
00:07:27,451 --> 00:07:28,800
Come on, David.

107
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:35,720
What do you want, honey?

108
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:38,374
I need to show you something.

109
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:40,289
Alison, go to bed.

110
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,944
- Dad?
- Alison.

111
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:53,172
Are you gonna come
to church tomorrow?

112
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:54,739
You promised
you'd come this Sunday.

113
00:07:59,134 --> 00:08:00,614
Fine.

114
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:07,752
Good night.

115
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:01,457
Mark!!

116
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:07,072
Mark? Where are you?

117
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:11,293
Mark? Where are you?

118
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,271
What?!? Do you need water?

119
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:34,012
Did you call this in?

120
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:36,275
No, no, no.

121
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:37,755
Take it easy, Mark.

122
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:38,973
He's hot and diaphoretic.

123
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,322
Where did you find him?

124
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:42,324
I just found him
here on the floor.

125
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:43,411
Take it easy...

126
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:48,592
His pupils are dilated.

127
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,897
What did he take?

128
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:55,120
Water...

129
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:56,643
It's the water!

130
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,970
{\an8}<i>David! I've been
trying to call you!</i>

131
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:14,182
Kate! Kate, are you okay?

132
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:15,923
- {\an8}<i>Yes, but...</i>
- Listen... don't drink

133
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,795
the water, there's
something wrong with it.

134
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:19,187
- {\an8}<i>What?</i>
- Yeah.

135
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:20,667
- {\an8}<i>David why?</i>
- No matter what,

136
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:21,992
don't drink anything out
of the tap water.

137
00:10:22,016 --> 00:10:23,452
I'll be home as soon as I can.

138
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,629
{\an8}<i>Alison, did you drink that?</i>

139
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:27,239
- Kate.
<i>- Alison, honey are you okay?</i>

140
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,372
Kate! Kate, is there
something wrong with Alison?

141
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:47,563
There's something wrong
with the water.

142
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:49,740
The organic content readings

143
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,935
are higher than I've ever seen
before and I don't know why.

144
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,135
His blood pressure
is 225 palpitations.

145
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:56,442
Give me 5 mg of prednisone.

146
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:57,748
I can't get a line on him.

147
00:10:57,835 --> 00:11:00,402
Give me the auto injector.

148
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:01,926
Here, give it on your side.

149
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,062
He stopped breathing.

150
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:12,066
Check the rig.

151
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:13,807
Here we go.

152
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:16,114
You know what.
That's it. Let's go.

153
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,943
This is the end.

154
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:33,044
I'm sorry Mark.

155
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:54,979
Come on!

156
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,632
I'm gonna take my own truck!!

157
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:32,364
Come on Sam, pick up. Come on!

158
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,495
David.

159
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:35,062
Sam! Sam, Are you okay?

160
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:36,411
Have you been hit yet?

161
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:38,370
{\an8}<i>No. They haven't hit Vegas.</i>

162
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,304
But we're getting the reports
here in the lab... you alright?

163
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:42,113
Yeah, listen, I'm fine.

164
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,029
But I think they're affecting
the water. It killed Mark.

165
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:46,900
{\an8}<i>Yeah, he's not the first...</i>

166
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:48,597
Any idea what it is?

167
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,599
I think it's a radioactive
thujone derivative.

168
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,429
But I'd like your systems
report so that I could verify.

169
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:57,215
Okay. Sure.
You know what the source is?

170
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:59,608
At this rate, by tomorrow
morning all the groundwater

171
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,611
from here to Los Angeles
will be compromised.

172
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,526
There's some
contaminated aquifers.

173
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:07,573
But the primary source
is Lake Mead.

174
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,055
This thing is deadly
up to 10 days after ingestion.

175
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:12,404
Ten days...

176
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,275
Survival depends on a person's

177
00:13:14,362 --> 00:13:16,930
ability to make antibodies...

178
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:19,628
We've started working
on an antidote...

179
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,500
Depending on exposure level,

180
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:23,328
it could be a lot
quicker than that.

181
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:26,070
They're bringing people...

182
00:13:26,157 --> 00:13:29,377
Sam! Sam!

183
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:31,249
Sam, can you hear me?

184
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:40,258
{\an8}<i>This area is under quarantine</i>

186
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:47,221

Sir. I need you
to step back, sir!

188
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,442
I live right here.

189
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,444
This is my house! I need to...

190
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,793
I understand, sir. I understand.

191
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,839
But this is a quarantined area.

192
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,231
Come with me, please.

193
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:02,846
- Sir...
- Alright! Alright!

194
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:04,084
- Taking you into quarantine.
- Hold on.

{\an8}<i>Clearing disaster area.</i>

196
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,330
- No!
- Mommy!

00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:12,551
That's my wife!
That's my daughter!

198
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:14,118
DAVID!!!

199

200
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:19,253
Kate! Kate!

201
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,779
Wait! Alison. No!

202
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:25,507
Alison! Please, just...
- Sir, you need...

203
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,091
They're gone sir.

204
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:34,007
Alison! Kate!

205
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,616

208
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,906
I'm on my way
to Vegas right now.

209
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,189
My family has been taken in the
quarantine and I just wanted

210
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:50,997
to see if you knew
anything about it...

211
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,999
I think my daughter is sick.

212
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:56,046
Call me back as soon
as you can. My phone is dying.

213

Hey!

226
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:32,055
Wait! It's okay.

227
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:34,361
No. No. It's okay.

228
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:37,234
You're okay. You'll be okay.

229
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:44,023
Listen to me! Listen to me!

230
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:52,727
I have to give you this
shot or you're going to die!

231
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:54,294
Okay?

232
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:56,557
Ahh!

233
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:20,581
Great.

234
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:39,948

235
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:44,170
Come on!

236
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:49,697
It's okay, you're alright.

237
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:51,438

It's okay. Stop!
What are you doing? Stop!

255

Hey, listen, I'm not going
to hurt you. It's okay.

256
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,824
It's okay. I'm not going
to hurt you. Alright?

257
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:59,523
I'm just gonna borrow your Jeep,
to get us to Vegas,

258
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,613
and then I'll give it back,
okay? Okay?!

259
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,746
- Pull over!
- What?!

260
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,706
Pull over now!

261
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:12,797
Fine.

262
00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:40,215
Are you okay?

263
00:21:44,611 --> 00:21:47,135
Oh yeah. You're okay,
you're okay.

264
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,746
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Come on!

265
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,922
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

266
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,924
Hi, I'm Lynn.

267
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,795
- I'm David.
- Nice to meet you.

268
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,408
Do you have a toothbrush?

269
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:00,061
What?

270
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:02,716
Or some shampoo?

271
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:04,936
No.

272
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,331
Oh, yeah. Come on. Let's go

273
00:22:39,231 --> 00:22:42,321
Is that for me? Thanks!

274
00:22:47,195 --> 00:22:49,067
So... we're really
going to Vegas?

275
00:22:49,154 --> 00:22:52,940
- Yep.
- Fantastic...

276
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:56,422
whoa. what was in
that injection thing?!

277
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,119
Midazolam.

278
00:22:58,206 --> 00:23:00,470
Right.

279
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:03,473
So you're not into Vegas?

280
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,604
Got it.

281
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:06,780
I have an ex-boyfriend... recent.

282
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:11,742
Ex-job, ex-apartment,
ex-dog, ex-sister...

283
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:14,397
Nothing like the end
of the world

284
00:23:14,484 --> 00:23:18,183
to put things in perspective.

285
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,447
So... where exactly
are we going in Vegas?

286
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,147
We're gonna see my friend

287
00:23:26,234 --> 00:23:27,758
about the water contamination.

288
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:30,108
Maybe I could get
some answers...

289
00:23:30,195 --> 00:23:32,763
Water contamination?

290
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,287
Yeah, that's what made you sick.

291
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:39,422
I saw a soda next to you
at the gas station.

292
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:42,250
I haven't felt like this since
I got motion sickness

293
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,905
on the Matterhorn
at Disneyland...

294
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:52,870
So... anyway.
I puked all over my shirt,

295
00:23:52,957 --> 00:23:56,613
and Mickey wouldn't hug me...

296
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,179
Which is really
the story of my life,

297
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:01,226
when I think about it.

298
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:05,535
You really puked
on the Matterhorn?

299
00:24:05,622 --> 00:24:07,188
Oh yeah!

300
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:27,513
Ahhh!

301
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:34,651
The engine's dead.

302
00:24:34,738 --> 00:24:37,305
Come one, get out!

303
00:24:40,091 --> 00:24:41,091
Ah!

304
00:24:41,135 --> 00:24:42,572
Come on!

305
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:48,969
Come on.

306
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,664
David, wake up!

307
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:16,361
Where did you get the water?

308
00:26:20,017 --> 00:26:21,148
I don't know.

309
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:32,725
Just a sip. It's good

310
00:26:40,994 --> 00:26:43,083
We have a directive
from DHS control.

311
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,085
If we tell the staff,
this gets away from us.

312
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,521
If you want staff to stay staff

313
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:48,523
you'll tell them
what's going on.

314
00:26:48,611 --> 00:26:50,110
I'm not going to let
bureaucracy step on my team.

315
00:26:50,134 --> 00:26:52,919
We'll lose operational
control...

316
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:54,834
You call this control?
Since they put us under

317
00:26:54,921 --> 00:26:57,271
the DHS, we put
5,000 non-contagious people into

318
00:26:57,358 --> 00:27:00,405
quarantine. In the middle of
the biggest catastrophe since

319
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:03,800
the ice age, the Secretary of
the DHS wants to detain the sick

320
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:04,951
instead of fight the disease.

321
00:27:04,975 --> 00:27:06,411
We both know the protocol.

322
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:08,258
If a waterborne pathogen
gets in the water...

323
00:27:08,282 --> 00:27:10,763
It's high school biology.
These guidelines

324
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,593
are just a study in politics
trumping science.

325
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,075
The meteorites fell and
the Secretary blinked. She ran

326
00:27:18,162 --> 00:27:21,426
it by the book to cover herself.
So we're gonna throw the book

327
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:23,602
away and save these people.

328
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:25,952
As Deputy Director
I have to report you

329
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,826
to the Secretary of the DHS.

330
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:32,698
She'll have
to remove me by force.

331
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:51,108
Everybody give me your
attention please! Listen up!

332
00:27:51,195 --> 00:27:53,850
By now you probably have
heard the rumors...

333
00:27:53,937 --> 00:27:56,156
Now I'd like to
give you the facts.

334
00:27:58,506 --> 00:28:02,249
Several days ago NASA
revised its estimates

335
00:28:02,336 --> 00:28:06,427
on the trajectory
of a long period comet.

336
00:28:06,514 --> 00:28:11,258
And they discovered it was on
a collision course with earth.

337
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:13,826
All of the nuclear armed
countries launched

338
00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:16,786
their nuclear warheads and ICBMs

339
00:28:16,873 --> 00:28:20,006
but it backfired.

340
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:24,097
Hundreds of meteorites have
collided with the planet

341
00:28:24,184 --> 00:28:28,493
and thousands more
are on their way.

342
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,716
As you already know most
of central Las Vegas

343
00:28:33,803 --> 00:28:37,110
has been destroyed... the strip,
downtown, McCarran Airport.

344
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:39,504
So we need to move fast.

345
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:42,594
The CDC building hasn't been
hit. Is that right, Sharon?

346
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:45,205
Yes, that's correct.
The building is intact, but the

347
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:48,513
power's out and the water's
down... there's no way they can

348
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,732
deal with our quarantine.

349
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:51,168
Deaths?

350
00:28:51,255 --> 00:28:52,647
Several. All from the water.

351
00:28:52,735 --> 00:28:53,842
Do we know anything
about the diseases?

352
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:55,128
About the fatalities?

353
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:57,261
- Mr. Pitts?
- Go ahead, Candace.

354
00:28:57,348 --> 00:28:58,908
Their toxicology team
is telling me that

355
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:01,352
if a significant amount
is ingested...

356
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:04,703
About four ounces... then
the pathogen is fatal.

357
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:08,533
Depending on the amount,
it could be hours to days...

358
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,188
seizures followed by death.

359
00:29:11,275 --> 00:29:13,166
We need to get those people
rushed into treatment.

360
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,515
Vegas can't handle it,
so we got to get them

361
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:16,323
some place that can.

362
00:29:21,546 --> 00:29:23,766
We're going to do it
right this time. I don't

363
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:25,733
care how many meteors come...
We can't just throw

364
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:28,031
these people away.
Our nearest facility is

365
00:29:28,118 --> 00:29:31,208
in Los Angeles, so let's send
these people there ASAP.

366
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:32,687
Donny, can you
do a transpo evac?

367
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:35,255
We got to get them
outta there quick.

368
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:37,016
Can we get security?
I'm getting reports of

369
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,563
heavy looting by armed gangs...

370
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,173
Someone get on that.

371
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,088
Candance, do we have
anything from the labs?

372
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:44,482
Cures, vaccines?

373
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:46,571
Get with them
at the L.A. Metro DHS.

374
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:48,399
And see if they got
rooms to handle these

375
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,009
people at their facility.

376
00:29:50,096 --> 00:29:52,882
Harvey, we keep
getting calls from the DHS.

377
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:55,275
They're calling every line,
even the secure connection...

378
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:56,842
I think it's urgent.

379
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,496
Don't pick up.

380
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,628
They'll threaten you
like they threatened me.

381
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,414
I want to get these people
out of Vegas

382
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,111
before they can stop us.

383
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,079
Are you okay?

384
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,824
It's strangely liberating.

385
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:23,956
We don't know for sure.

386
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:26,916
The body could build up
its own immunity...

387
00:30:27,003 --> 00:30:30,528
I'm a pessimist.

388
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:33,270
Maybe my friend Sam
can help you.

389
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:36,577
He's working on an antidote.

390
00:30:36,664 --> 00:30:38,579
Here.

391
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:42,105
Yeah. Just a sec.

392
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:45,804
Come on. Let's go.

393
00:31:03,517 --> 00:31:07,130
Kate! Alison!

394
00:31:07,217 --> 00:31:10,394
David, what are we doing?

395
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:12,657
Alison!?

396
00:31:12,744 --> 00:31:15,225
David, who are we looking for?

397
00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:21,666
My wife, my daughter
were taken here

398
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:23,973
after the meteors fell...

399
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,366
I have got to find my friend.

400
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,509
Yeah, it's the place.

401
00:31:41,555 --> 00:31:43,079
What is this place?

402
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,864
It's the Vegas federal complex.

403
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:47,387
I think we're
in the CDC building.

404
00:31:47,474 --> 00:31:50,521
One of my colleagues works here.

405
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,412
He knew about the quarantine
before they took my family.

406
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:54,481
So I think he should know
where I can find them.

407
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:00,705
Oh, this must be
the departments, okay...

408
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:03,838
Customs and Border Protection...
FEMA...

409
00:32:03,926 --> 00:32:07,059
- Federal Water Quality Agency.
- 194.

410
00:32:07,146 --> 00:32:08,756
It's right there.

411
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,716
He's sick and you can fix him!!!

412
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:13,413
Now give it to me!!

413
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:21,117
It's not finished...

414
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:23,815
NO! I need it NOW!!!

415
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:27,297
Use this if you can.

416
00:32:27,384 --> 00:32:30,561
Get up! GET UP!!

417
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,650
- Hey!
- DON'T MOVE!

418
00:32:32,737 --> 00:32:34,913
It's okay. I can help.

419
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,264
I've got information here
that she needs.

420
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:41,789
I just need to see the formula.
Okay? Where is it?

421
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,314
It's on the counter.

422
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:46,664
- Okay.
- Okay. Cool.

423
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,976
STAY THERE!

424
00:33:02,201 --> 00:33:04,203
Yeah, I'm working on it.

425
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,857
I'll be right down.

426
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:12,298
I need some saline.

427
00:33:12,385 --> 00:33:15,258
Aah, It's above
the sink. It's labeled.

428
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:18,000
Quick!

429
00:33:23,831 --> 00:33:25,529
- Quick!
- Alright!

430
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,847
DAVID!

431
00:33:41,675 --> 00:33:43,262
There are more of them.
They're coming back.

432
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:45,288
Here. 20 mililiters.

433
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,439
Are you sure this
is going to work?

434
00:33:46,463 --> 00:33:48,204
Yeah.

435
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,946
Okay. This should
neutralize the contaminants.

436
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:53,992
Can you make more of this?

437
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,602
Yes, I'm gonna go
to my other lab,

438
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:59,258
I should be safe there.
Here you go.

439
00:33:59,345 --> 00:34:03,784
What happened to all the
people that were quarantined?

440
00:34:03,871 --> 00:34:05,917
Uh, Everyone here
at the federal office

441
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:09,355
went to L.A.

442
00:34:09,442 --> 00:34:11,749
I'm going to L.A.

443
00:34:16,623 --> 00:34:19,104
I'm not staying here.

444
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:22,673
Wait. The antidote
hasn't been tested.

445
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,680
If we had the equation
wrong... it could be fatal.

446
00:34:28,157 --> 00:34:30,115
Come on.

447
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:38,558
Oh, sh...

448
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:52,790
It's locked.

449
00:35:07,326 --> 00:35:08,980
Right there... We need to jump.

450
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:14,899
We have to jump...

451
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:18,032
I can't! This is too...
this is too high.

452
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,123
David! On 3.

453
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,950
1... 2...

454
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,778
No! No. I can't!

455
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:27,041
David!

456
00:35:27,129 --> 00:35:29,392
No, I'm afraid of heights.

457
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:31,568
Then we have to go back.

458
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:37,313
Hey!

459
00:35:47,453 --> 00:35:49,281
Back here. Come on.

460
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:11,521
Alright, come on.

461
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:12,870
David!

462
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:15,655
Come on, we got to keep moving.

463
00:36:15,742 --> 00:36:18,745
We'll get you some water.

464
00:36:18,832 --> 00:36:21,139
You alright?

465
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:17,891
What are you doing?

466
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:19,763
This is the antidote Sam
was working on.

467
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,765
No. I'm gonna wait.

468
00:37:21,852 --> 00:37:23,506
Come on! You're getting sicker!

469
00:37:23,593 --> 00:37:24,811
You got to take it now!

470
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:26,160
What, so you can test it?

471
00:37:26,248 --> 00:37:27,573
Make sure it works
for your daughter?

472
00:37:27,597 --> 00:37:29,294
No. Come on...

473
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:32,819
David, it's okay.

474
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:41,132
Look. You hold on to it.
Okay Lynn?

475
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:44,744
In case you change your mind.

476
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:49,009
I'm gonna go look for some
water. Try to figure out

477
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:50,533
a way to get back to L.A.

478
00:38:28,788 --> 00:38:31,835
Lynn!

479
00:38:35,491 --> 00:38:37,580
Here...

480
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:55,641
Did You hear that?

481
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:57,861
You said you heard something?

482
00:38:57,948 --> 00:38:59,123
Wait a sec... what's this?

483
00:39:04,868 --> 00:39:06,435
She's still alive.

484
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,846
Cops.

485
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:30,763
Cops, cops, cops, cops.

486
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:35,072
FBI! Drop your guns! Get down.

487
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,421
Get out! Drop your weapons now!

488
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,995
FBI! Drop your weapons!

489
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:50,261
DROP YOUR WEAPONS! FREEZE!

490
00:39:53,003 --> 00:39:56,746
Hey! Hey! I'm unarmed!

491
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,617
- Hey! Hey!
- I'm unarmed!

492
00:39:58,704 --> 00:40:01,011
- Stop right there!
- I'm unarmed! Don't shoot!

493
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,274
Turn around! Turn around!

494
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:06,538
Put your hands behind your head!
Lock your fingers!

495
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:09,628
Now, on your knees!
Down! Down! Now!

496
00:40:09,715 --> 00:40:11,804
Okay! Wait!

497
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:13,502
Stop right there!

498
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:16,461
Stop right there! Down on
the ground! On the ground!

499
00:40:23,163 --> 00:40:26,993
So... what is this?

500
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,606
I'm just trying to get to
L.A. I'm looking for my family.

501
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:35,175
They were detained.
Taken in the quarantine.

502
00:40:35,262 --> 00:40:38,048
Please, sir.
I think my daughter is sick.

503
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,490
And I know where
there's clean water.

504
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:29,229
Take 142. It's safer.

505
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:45,550
When the meteorites
started to fall

506
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,726
Homeland Security had
no clue what to do.

507
00:41:47,813 --> 00:41:50,947
I mean people were sick, so what
happens? Some bureaucrat yells

508
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:52,862
quarantine, and the next thing
you know

509
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:54,733
northwest Clark County
gets cleaned out.

510
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,300
Why L.A.?

511
00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:58,432
Well, 'cause after
Vegas got hit,

512
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,130
they didn't have
the admin support.

513
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,872
They had to move the operation
over to Los Angeles.

514
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,657
All the quarantined
people are packed in

515
00:42:05,744 --> 00:42:09,008
at the Metro Detention Center
at downtown L.A.

516
00:42:09,095 --> 00:42:10,793
But wasn't L.A.
affected by the meteorites?

517
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,422
I heard something on the
radio about a comet...

518
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,057
- No.
- Are you sure? Cuz I heard...

519
00:42:14,144 --> 00:42:16,146
No!

520
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,278
Alright, so you want
to tell me about your...

521
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:22,544
your goodie bag there?

522
00:42:22,631 --> 00:42:25,459
Midazolam injectors?

523
00:42:25,547 --> 00:42:27,244
Yeah, I took a peek.
That's what I do.

524
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:34,773
{\an8}<i>Southbound 4529
we are in pursuit of a...</i>

525
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,907
{\an8}<i>Repeat 10-0
on the Southbound I-15.</i>

526
00:42:37,994 --> 00:42:39,909
Relax. Enjoy the sunshine.

527
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:44,740
{\an8}<i>10-0 southbound, do you copy?</i>

528
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:47,830
Yeah. 10-1 on that.

529
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:52,312
10-9. I repeat, 10-9.

530
00:42:52,399 --> 00:42:56,839
{\an8}<i>Southbound I-15.</i>

531
00:42:56,926 --> 00:42:59,929
{\an8}<i>I repeat, 10-0 on Southbound...</i>

532
00:43:00,016 --> 00:43:01,800
{\an8}<i>request directive from
Incident Command...</i>

533
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:07,240
This is Special
Agent Jake Nielson.

534
00:43:07,327 --> 00:43:09,242
Would one of you Clark County
thick-necks

535
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:11,462
tell me what the hell
is going on?

536
00:43:23,866 --> 00:43:26,564
Looks like someone told them
about our water!

537
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,622
No. No. Run 'em down!
Run 'em down!

538
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,759
Tell me about the meteors.

539
00:44:30,846 --> 00:44:32,108
LEMME OUTTA HERE!

540
00:44:32,195 --> 00:44:33,239
Never!

541
00:44:33,326 --> 00:44:35,894
TELL ME!

542
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,987
A comet is going
to wipe out the city

543
00:44:42,074 --> 00:44:44,250
of Los Angeles in three days.

544
00:44:47,906 --> 00:44:49,603
My son is there.

545
00:44:56,175 --> 00:44:58,656
Just leave the car
and the water. Get out!

546
00:45:01,354 --> 00:45:03,792
I didn't want Munez to know.

547
00:45:12,104 --> 00:45:14,498
There's only one gun.

548
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,097
This is a de facto arrest.

549
00:47:15,184 --> 00:47:17,099
I need to hear my rights...

550
00:47:30,068 --> 00:47:32,592
Harvey Pitts is going to
be reassigned to the field.

551
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:36,031
I am now the Director of the
Center for Disease Containment.

552
00:47:36,118 --> 00:47:38,685
You are not allowed to
communicate with anyone

553
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:42,907
about the activities
at the CDC or the DHS.

554
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:44,648
Is that clear?

555
00:47:44,735 --> 00:47:47,825
I want to retroactively
terminate all operations

556
00:47:47,912 --> 00:47:50,523
that Pitts initiated in
the last twelve hours.

557
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:53,309
The Secretary of the DHS
has told me,

558
00:47:53,396 --> 00:47:57,052
and NASA has confirmed, that
a comet is going to destroy

559
00:47:57,139 --> 00:48:00,490
the city of Los Angeles
in three days.

560
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,449
You need to be prepared
to coordinate a response

561
00:48:03,536 --> 00:48:05,974
with the other offices
around the country.

562
00:48:06,061 --> 00:48:08,150
The slower the information leak,
the easier it is

563
00:48:08,237 --> 00:48:10,892
to coordinate a response.

564
00:48:22,947 --> 00:48:24,209
David... we have to keep moving.

565
00:48:28,735 --> 00:48:31,477
How much water do we have left?

566
00:48:31,564 --> 00:48:33,827
Less than half a bottle

567
00:48:33,915 --> 00:48:36,047
You'd better drink it.

568
00:48:36,134 --> 00:48:37,416
No. You first.
I haven't seen you drink

569
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,442
since yesterday morning.

570
00:48:59,418 --> 00:49:02,291
My wife would call
this a Kingdom moment.

571
00:49:02,378 --> 00:49:05,381
What's that?

572
00:49:05,468 --> 00:49:08,123
I don't even know.

573
00:49:09,907 --> 00:49:12,779
I think your wife
is probably right.

574
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,130
I hear the highway over here.
Come on, let's keep going.

575
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:17,975
We can't leave them all
at the Metro Detention Center!

576
00:50:18,062 --> 00:50:20,325
The faster you process,
the faster they leave!

577
00:50:20,412 --> 00:50:23,459
We can't process 5,000 people
before that comet strikes!

578
00:50:25,678 --> 00:50:27,941
Hello?

579
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:29,421
{\an8}<i>Candace, it's me, Harvey Pitts.</i>

580
00:50:29,508 --> 00:50:31,075
{\an8}<i>They have me
coordinating California.</i>

581
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,946
{\an8}<i>From what they're saying,</i>

582
00:50:33,034 --> 00:50:34,644
{\an8}<i>it could be a death sentence.</i>

583
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:37,081
Harvey, Peter's really
hurting our operation.

584
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:38,865
He's cutting into everything...

585
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,129
{\an8}<i>I have a plan for
saving those people. I have</i>

586
00:50:41,216 --> 00:50:44,175
{\an8}<i>autonomy with our equipment and
personnel here, but it'll take</i>

587
00:50:44,262 --> 00:50:46,612
{\an8}<i>some logistics from your end.</i>

588
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:49,398
{\an8}<i>And you have to hide it
from Peter.</i>

589
00:50:49,485 --> 00:50:51,313
Okay.

590
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,966
You are sentencing them
all to death.

591
00:50:53,054 --> 00:50:54,335
I don't have
jurisdiction over that facility!

592
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:56,361
If I could wave a magic wand,
I would.

593
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,640
Do not jump the barricade.

594
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:34,285
Hey!

595
00:52:34,372 --> 00:52:35,982
Where's the Metro
Detention Center...

596
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,419
I think it's destroyed.

597
00:52:37,506 --> 00:52:40,204
How do I get there?

598
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,904
Right there!

599
00:52:46,558 --> 00:52:50,736
David! We should find
the rendezvous point...

600
00:52:50,823 --> 00:52:52,477
Come on!

601
00:52:52,564 --> 00:52:54,284
We should at
least figure out where it is...

602
00:52:57,047 --> 00:52:59,876
{\an8}<i>Last evacuation
from rendezvous point...</i>

603
00:53:10,843 --> 00:53:12,125
Excuse me. Detention
Center is right here?

604
00:53:12,149 --> 00:53:13,498
Yes.

605
00:53:27,947 --> 00:53:30,298
You sure this is it?

606
00:53:30,385 --> 00:53:32,474
This is it.
This is where they went.

607
00:53:43,702 --> 00:53:46,401
Why don't you go on...

608
00:53:46,488 --> 00:53:49,230
why don't you go on
and find the rendezvous point.

609
00:53:49,317 --> 00:53:51,319
NO!

610
00:53:51,406 --> 00:53:54,757
Go on!

611
00:53:54,844 --> 00:53:56,802
You're so selfish.

612
00:53:56,889 --> 00:53:59,501
Selfish? I have thought
about nothing but my

613
00:53:59,588 --> 00:54:01,024
wife and daughter
for days now...

614
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:02,567
I have been risking
my life for them...

615
00:54:02,591 --> 00:54:04,941
And I'm risking my life for you!

616
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,356
Lynn!

617
00:54:28,443 --> 00:54:30,749
I'm sorry. Okay?

618
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:11,937
Hey! What are you doing?
You want to get shot?!

619
00:56:12,024 --> 00:56:14,897
You don't know about the curfew?

620
00:56:14,984 --> 00:56:17,290
No ma'am.

621
00:56:17,378 --> 00:56:19,467
Lord have mercy...

622
00:56:21,556 --> 00:56:24,036
She's sick.

623
00:56:24,123 --> 00:56:27,300
Come! Come! Help me. Help me.

624
00:56:27,388 --> 00:56:28,650
Come.

625
00:56:28,737 --> 00:56:32,044
Come on. Drink some.

626
00:56:34,351 --> 00:56:36,919
Come on!
You're all coming with me.

627
00:56:38,355 --> 00:56:40,313
Come on! Let's go!

628
00:56:40,401 --> 00:56:42,011
Just around the corner.

629
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:49,366
This is the only
rendezvous point in the area.

630
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:52,717
And we're being evacuated
in the morning.

631
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,726
I'm looking for my wife
and my twelve-year-old

632
00:57:44,813 --> 00:57:47,076
daughter. They're from Nevada.

633
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:49,470
They're probably at one
of the refugee camps

634
00:57:49,557 --> 00:57:52,255
east of the city.

635
00:57:52,342 --> 00:57:53,952
Then that's where
I'm going to go.

636
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:56,128
They'll shoot you if they
find you on the street.

637
00:57:56,215 --> 00:57:58,696
Nobody's supposed to
be out past curfew.

638
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,350
I don't care.

639
00:58:00,437 --> 00:58:01,960
You're not going to be any good

640
00:58:02,047 --> 00:58:03,875
to your family if you're dead.

641
00:58:08,227 --> 00:58:10,316
You're staying with us tonight.

642
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,231
Evacuation is first thing
in the morning.

643
00:58:49,181 --> 00:58:50,487
David!

644
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:18,167
Thirsty?

645
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,691
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Mm hmm

646
00:59:26,088 --> 00:59:27,655
Ah.

647
00:59:27,742 --> 00:59:30,658
- Can't sleep?
- No.

648
00:59:30,745 --> 00:59:34,487
Miss your family?

649
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:36,620
Yeah.

650
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,799
It seems pretty natural to me.

651
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:46,369
Never used to be to me...

652
00:59:46,456 --> 00:59:47,892
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

653
00:59:54,812 --> 00:59:57,467
What about you?
Where's your family?

654
00:59:57,554 --> 01:00:00,252
How come you're not with them?

655
01:00:00,339 --> 01:00:03,604
I am. This is my family.

656
01:00:07,129 --> 01:00:09,305
There's a proverb that says

657
01:00:09,392 --> 01:00:12,874
"Do not go to your brother's
house when disaster

658
01:00:12,961 --> 01:00:16,660
"strikes you...
Better a neighbor nearby

659
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:18,531
than a brother far away."

660
01:00:23,972 --> 01:00:26,322
You know, when I was younger,

661
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:29,673
I used to think

662
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,025
there was nothing
more important in life

663
01:00:34,112 --> 01:00:36,593
than to take care
of me and mine.

664
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,814
You know, look out for myself.

665
01:00:39,901 --> 01:00:42,077
Yeah.

666
01:00:42,164 --> 01:00:43,644
'Cause no one else was...

667
01:00:48,823 --> 01:00:52,783
But then I found somebody.

668
01:01:28,558 --> 01:01:33,215
Shh... David! Wake up!

669
01:01:33,302 --> 01:01:36,131
OW!

670
01:01:36,218 --> 01:01:38,829
Okay. Hurry, hurry.
They're not going to wait.

671
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:41,092
Sorry.

672
01:01:41,179 --> 01:01:42,746
I haven't relapsed yet.

673
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:46,315
Yeah. You look better.

674
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,839
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

675
01:01:48,926 --> 01:01:52,321
Well, they're going to
evacuate soon.

676
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:55,672
What if they are not
at the camp?

677
01:01:55,759 --> 01:01:59,415
David. We have to go...

678
01:01:59,502 --> 01:02:01,765
What if they're waiting for you?

679
01:02:05,595 --> 01:02:07,249
We'll be ready.

680
01:02:09,512 --> 01:02:12,863
Somebody help her please!

681
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:16,258
Somebody help her, please!
Please! Somebody help her!

682
01:02:16,345 --> 01:02:19,609
Please! Please!

683
01:02:19,696 --> 01:02:22,264
Please! Somebody help her!
She's sick...

684
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:24,440
She started having another
attack... I...

685
01:02:24,527 --> 01:02:25,920
How long she's like this?

686
01:02:26,007 --> 01:02:27,399
I don't know! Maybe an hour.

687
01:02:27,486 --> 01:02:28,879
It's never been this bad.

688
01:02:28,966 --> 01:02:30,838
Okay, we need to lay her flat.

689
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,411
I can give her a shot
to stop the seizures.

690
01:02:49,421 --> 01:02:51,467
Please... please... please...

691
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,688
It's not working

692
01:02:58,169 --> 01:02:59,494
I don't want to give
her more of this

693
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:00,781
because it could stop her heart.

694
01:03:05,437 --> 01:03:07,352
Shh... shh...

695
01:03:19,756 --> 01:03:20,975
David.

696
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:33,117
Please help me through this.

697
01:03:33,204 --> 01:03:35,685
You praying, Pastor?

698
01:03:35,772 --> 01:03:37,165
Always!

699
01:03:41,386 --> 01:03:43,606
I have a cure here, but it
hasn't been tested...

700
01:03:43,693 --> 01:03:46,261
There's a good chance
that this could...

701
01:03:46,348 --> 01:03:49,394
That this could kill her.

702
01:03:56,184 --> 01:03:58,621
- What's her name?
- Madeline.

703
01:03:58,708 --> 01:04:01,885
Madeline. Madeline!
Sit up, Madeline.

704
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:06,411
Hold this.

705
01:04:06,498 --> 01:04:09,023
You gotta drink this.
It's gonna save your life.

706
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,068
Open your mouth, honey, come on.

707
01:04:11,155 --> 01:04:12,853
Gotta force it in.
Open your mouth.

708
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,158
Open up.

709
01:04:14,245 --> 01:04:16,726
Good, good girl. Good girl.

710
01:04:18,162 --> 01:04:20,164
Good girl. Slowly.

711
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:36,050
Honey. Oh God, please.

712
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:41,055
Oh she's... Okay baby, come on.

713
01:04:41,142 --> 01:04:43,100
Come on baby girl. Come on.

714
01:04:46,887 --> 01:04:48,018
Get her to move.

715
01:04:48,105 --> 01:04:50,238
Baby, come on. Come on, come on.

716
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:56,940
Oh!

717
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:58,724
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

718
01:05:11,999 --> 01:05:15,002
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you so much.

719
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:27,425
Ma'am, you the rendezvous
point coordinator?

720
01:05:27,449 --> 01:05:28,972
Yes.

721
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,297
There are two vans ready.
We have to hurry.

722
01:05:30,321 --> 01:05:31,801
Oh, okay.

723
01:05:44,335 --> 01:05:46,294
Do you have children?

724
01:05:46,381 --> 01:05:49,862
Yeah. A daughter.
A few years older than her.

725
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:56,478
Where is she now?

726
01:05:56,565 --> 01:05:59,133
She's with my wife.
They were both taken

727
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,831
into quarantine
about three days ago...

728
01:06:01,918 --> 01:06:05,269
So were we. They took
us to Singing Springs.

729
01:06:05,356 --> 01:06:08,533
We came back on foot,
but a lot of people couldn't.

730
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,709
We didn't want to risk it.

731
01:06:10,796 --> 01:06:13,582
There's another quarantine?
I only knew about

732
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:15,758
the one at the Metro
but where is this one?

733
01:06:15,845 --> 01:06:17,542
The mountains northeast of L.A.

734
01:06:17,629 --> 01:06:20,937
Ma'am. We got to go.

735
01:06:21,024 --> 01:06:25,028
Yeah, it's far, but you might
be able to make it on foot.

736
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:28,771
There's a ravine
three miles in...

737
01:06:28,858 --> 01:06:30,425
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

738
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:41,784
Hurry... Hurry... Hurry.

739
01:07:01,064 --> 01:07:02,370
Mommy!

740
01:07:02,457 --> 01:07:04,198
We have two more!

741
01:07:04,285 --> 01:07:06,200
- Mommy!
- Go with your daughter.

742
01:07:07,462 --> 01:07:10,856
One more.

743
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,380
Who else? Let's go!

744
01:07:14,991 --> 01:07:17,994
We're staying.

745
01:07:18,081 --> 01:07:19,604
Now you go with them.
Go with them!

746
01:07:33,618 --> 01:07:35,098
Jesus help us!

747
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:38,971
- Come with us.
- No, I gotta help everybody.

748
01:07:41,539 --> 01:07:43,454
We got to get them out!

749
01:08:18,924 --> 01:08:20,361
{\an8}<i>Evac has been confirmed.</i>

750
01:08:20,448 --> 01:08:22,145
{\an8}<i>Will take place in 0200 hours.</i>

751
01:08:43,514 --> 01:08:45,777
David...

752
01:08:45,864 --> 01:08:48,258
What? Come on.

753
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:53,872
Come on.
We don't have much time.

754
01:08:53,959 --> 01:08:55,657
I think that's the ravine,
right up there.

755
01:08:55,744 --> 01:08:58,573
Just keep moving.
Just a little bit more.

756
01:10:35,017 --> 01:10:36,410
Sit down.

757
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:42,677
Okay, this is the last one.

758
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,771
You finish it.

759
01:11:10,095 --> 01:11:13,969
Come on. We got to climb.
Let's go.

760
01:11:14,056 --> 01:11:16,101
- I can't.
- Yes you can. Come on!

761
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:19,888
David... I can't.

762
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:26,590
Okay. You stay here.

763
01:11:26,677 --> 01:11:29,027
And I'm going to try
and find an easier way.

764
01:12:26,998 --> 01:12:28,260
Any luck?

765
01:12:28,348 --> 01:12:30,262
No.

766
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:32,743
- Hey?
- Yeah?

767
01:12:38,706 --> 01:12:41,491
Why didn't you leave me
at the gas station?

768
01:12:52,546 --> 01:12:55,505
Why am I still here with you?

769
01:13:03,339 --> 01:13:05,602
No. I can't

770
01:13:12,827 --> 01:13:15,177
I'm going to go look
for another way.

771
01:14:06,228 --> 01:14:10,275
Lynn? Lynn!

772
01:14:13,322 --> 01:14:15,629
Lynn!! Lynn!!

773
01:14:18,066 --> 01:14:20,068
Lynn! Lynn!

774
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:22,462
Come on, you have
to take the antidote now.

775
01:14:22,549 --> 01:14:25,029
Come on, Lynn!
- No. David. No. No.

776
01:14:26,204 --> 01:14:29,207
Save it for your daughter...

777
01:14:29,294 --> 01:14:31,383
Lynn, come on!

778
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:34,256
No. Lynn! Lynn! Please!

779
01:15:51,333 --> 01:15:52,943
Please help me.

780
01:15:55,163 --> 01:15:56,947
Please help me.

781
01:16:05,869 --> 01:16:09,699
Yes, there are still
some sick among the group.

782
01:16:09,786 --> 01:16:12,615
Yes. Medevac
as well as transport.

783
01:16:12,702 --> 01:16:14,748
Yeah... yeah...

784
01:16:14,835 --> 01:16:18,186
Can you hold?

785
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:21,319
Effective as of now, we
are no longer devoting resources

786
01:16:21,406 --> 01:16:24,671
to quarantine detainees.

787
01:16:24,758 --> 01:16:27,543
We still have a group
at Singing Springs.

788
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:30,981
You're telling us
to leave them stranded?

789
01:16:31,068 --> 01:16:33,984
They've been waiting for an
evac team like everyone else.

790
01:16:34,071 --> 01:16:37,161
What about their support staff?
They're government employees...

791
01:16:37,248 --> 01:16:39,729
People are going to die
no matter what we do.

792
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:46,301
We'll withdraw our guys
when we can. You know,

793
01:16:46,388 --> 01:16:48,825
all the cities around the
world are going to be hit

794
01:16:48,912 --> 01:16:51,785
in four hours. We don't have
time to save people in L.A.

795
01:16:51,872 --> 01:16:53,912
We have to devote resources
where they're effective.

796
01:16:57,094 --> 01:17:00,358
Look... you either do it now

797
01:17:00,445 --> 01:17:02,534
or you wait for the reprimand.

798
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:09,280
Okay. Thank you.

799
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:17,637
Harvey, we're clear on my end.

800
01:17:17,724 --> 01:17:19,464
{\an8}<i>Cross your fingers, Candace.</i>

801
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:20,964
{\an8}<i>We've got one chopper left,
and I'm not sure</i>

802
01:17:20,988 --> 01:17:23,686
{\an8}<i>how the blast will affect it...</i>

803
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:42,983
Hey!

804
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:47,204
Hey! Where is the detention
center?

805
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:48,945
- It's gone.
- It's gone...

806
01:18:49,032 --> 01:18:51,141
Everything is destroyed.
There are only a few of us left.

807
01:18:51,165 --> 01:18:53,820
We were waiting for the
evacuation but it never came.

808
01:18:55,082 --> 01:18:57,214
Did you bring a helicopter?

809
01:18:57,301 --> 01:19:01,784
No. I'm looking for
a woman and a little girl.

810
01:19:01,871 --> 01:19:03,588
There are still two more
people up the trail.

811
01:19:03,612 --> 01:19:05,919
Up here?

812
01:19:10,837 --> 01:19:13,796
Hey!

813
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:32,119
David!

814
01:19:32,206 --> 01:19:34,469
Kate!

815
01:19:36,427 --> 01:19:38,429
I heard... I heard your voice.

816
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:41,563
Oh.

817
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:46,481
Kate, I'm sorry. I'm sor...

818
01:19:46,568 --> 01:19:48,439
Shh...

819
01:19:48,526 --> 01:19:50,833
Alison, she's...

820
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:04,891
Alison! Alison!

821
01:20:11,201 --> 01:20:12,724
Prop her up.

822
01:20:12,812 --> 01:20:15,553
I have something
I need you to take, okay?

823
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:18,078
I need you to drink this.
- Shh...

824
01:20:18,165 --> 01:20:21,385
It's going to make you better.
Have some.

825
01:20:39,142 --> 01:20:42,102
Alison!

826
01:21:00,033 --> 01:21:03,253
Just tell me what we can do.

827
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:04,927
We've been waiting on
a directive throughout

828
01:21:04,951 --> 01:21:06,256
this crisis, and
it's never come!

829
01:21:06,343 --> 01:21:09,085
There's nothing we can do!

830
01:21:09,172 --> 01:21:10,434
Yes there is...

831
01:21:32,195 --> 01:21:34,284
I love you.

832
01:21:34,371 --> 01:21:35,764
I love you too.

833
01:22:49,316 --> 01:22:51,405
Hey!

834
01:22:52,623 --> 01:22:54,147
{\an8}<i>We got 'em!</i>

835
01:22:54,234 --> 01:22:55,713
{\an8}<i>And we're getting
them outta there!</i>

836
01:22:56,305 --> 01:23:56,547
