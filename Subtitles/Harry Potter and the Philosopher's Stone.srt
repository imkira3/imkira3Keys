Encoded by RippeR

2
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:27,271
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

3
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:41,668
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

4
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:47,174
Are the rumors true, Albus?

5
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:52,634
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

6
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:56,099
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

7
00:01:56,352 --> 00:02:00,265
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

8
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:05,684
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

9
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:28,675
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

10
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:32,752
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

11
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:37,432
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

12
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:40,718
Try not to wake him.

13
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:43,598
There you go.

14
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:53,572
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

15
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:59,027
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

16
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:03,239
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

17
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:08,413
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

18
00:03:08,673 --> 00:03:10,381
Exactly.

19
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:14,885
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

20
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,100
Until he's ready.

21
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:37,617
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

22
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,958
Good luck...

23
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:54,123
...Harry Potter.

24
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:14,695
Up. Get up!

25
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:18,819
Now!

26
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,875
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

27
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:52,353
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

28
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,360
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

29
00:04:57,572 --> 00:05:02,529
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

30
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:05,661
...for my Dudley's special day!

31
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:10,865
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

32
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:15,206
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

33
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,883
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

34
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:24,299
36?! But last year I had 37!

35
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:28,383
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

36
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:31,094
This is what we're going to do.

37
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:35,691
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

38
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:43,276
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

39
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,405
I'm warning you now, boy.

40
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:52,121
Any funny business, any at all...

41
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:55,370
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

42
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:57,873
Get in.

43
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:07,462
Make it move.

44
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:11,851
Move!

45
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:14,559
- Move!
- He's asleep!

46
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:17,311
He's boring.

47
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:21,195
Sorry about him.

48
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:25,104
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

49
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,484
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

50
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:34,918
Can you hear me?

51
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:41,465
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

52
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:43,336
Do you?

53
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:47,680
Do you talk to people often?

54
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:52,092
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

55
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,599
Do you miss your family?

56
00:06:57,482 --> 00:07:02,190
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

57
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:07,397
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

58
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:32,507
Thanks.

59
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:34,136
Anytime.

60
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,388
Snake!

61
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:58,205
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

62
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,578
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

63
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:07,163
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

64
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:17,346
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

65
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:22,022
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

66
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:26,099
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

67
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:33,319
There's no such thing as magic.

68
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:12,781
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

69
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:16,193
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

70
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,161
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

71
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:54,987
No more mail through this letterbox.

72
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:10,003
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

73
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:15,552
Shoo! Go on.

74
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:43,279
Fine day, Sunday.

75
00:10:43,913 --> 00:10:48,575
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

76
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:53,206
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

77
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:56,173
No post on Sunday.

78
00:10:57,593 --> 00:11:01,507
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

79
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:07,055
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

80
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:19,352
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

81
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:33,082
Make it stop, please!

82
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,789
Stop it!

83
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:43,882
Mummy, what's happening?

84
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:51,638
Give me that! Give me that letter!

85
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:56,017
Get off!

86
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:03,943
They're my letters! Let go of me!

87
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:07,785
That's it! We're going away!

88
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:12,120
Far away, where they can't find us!

89
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,583
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

90
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:52,785
Make a wish, Harry.

91
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,929
Who's there?

92
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:25,519
Sorry about that.

93
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:36,989
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

94
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:42,712
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

95
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,426
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

96
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,182
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

97
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:59,229
I'm not Harry.

98
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:04,765
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

99
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:07,146
Got something for you.

100
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:12,948
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

101
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,870
Baked it myself, words and all.

102
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:25,453
Thank you.

103
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:29,843
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

104
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:49,153
Excuse me, but who are you?

105
00:14:49,362 --> 00:14:54,273
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

106
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:58,235
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

107
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:03,741
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

108
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,378
Learned what?

109
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:08,125
You're a wizard, Harry.

110
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,380
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

111
00:15:11,593 --> 00:15:14,629
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

112
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,758
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

113
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:20,975
...I can't be a wizard.

114
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:26,389
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

115
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:31,480
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

116
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:36,357
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

117
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,878
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

118
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:59,345
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

119
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:04,514
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

120
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:08,939
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

121
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:12,233
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

122
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:16,146
My perfect sister being who she was.

123
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:22,319
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

124
00:16:22,537 --> 00:16:26,701
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

125
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:30,582
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

126
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:32,539
A freak!

127
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:35,709
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

128
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:41,630
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

129
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:46,842
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

130
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:51,060
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

131
00:16:51,316 --> 00:16:55,610
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

132
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,734
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

133
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:02,404
He'll not be going.

134
00:17:02,618 --> 00:17:05,951
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

135
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:07,153
Muggle?

136
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:11,495
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

137
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,578
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

138
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:21,717
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

139
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,722
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

140
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:31,477
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

141
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,729
...in front of me.

142
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:56,868
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

143
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,211
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

144
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:05,512
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

145
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:14,890
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

146
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:32,489
"All students must be equipped with...

147
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:35,623
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

148
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:41,624
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

149
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:44,456
Can we find all this in London?

150
00:18:44,678 --> 00:18:47,051
If you know where to go.

151
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:12,781
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

152
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:16,864
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

153
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:20,169
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.

154
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:23,956
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

155
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:31,713
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

156
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:36,261
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

157
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:41,971
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

158
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:44,729
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

159
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:49,938
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

160
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:52,566
Oh, nice to meet you.

161
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:55,912
Fearfully fascinating subject.

162
00:19:56,123 --> 00:20:00,749
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

163
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:05,833
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

164
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:07,792
Goodbye.

165
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:14,094
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

166
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:17,759
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

167
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:21,761
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

168
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,539
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

169
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:01,383
Here, you get your quills and ink.

170
00:21:01,646 --> 00:21:05,560
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

171
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:32,664
It's a world-class racing broom.

172
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:36,751
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

173
00:21:37,014 --> 00:21:40,299
It's the fastest model yet.

174
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,598
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

175
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:52,187
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

176
00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:57,909
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

177
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:14,544
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

178
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,002
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

179
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:22,180
Best stay close.

180
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:29,893
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

181
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:37,278
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

182
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,443
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

183
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:47,123
Ha! There's the little devil.

184
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:50,202
And there's something else as well.

185
00:22:51,462 --> 00:22:54,796
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

186
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:03,921
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

187
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:07,182
Very well.

188
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:15,233
Vault 687.

189
00:23:17,154 --> 00:23:19,442
Lamp, please.

190
00:23:27,957 --> 00:23:29,285
Key, please.

191
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,478
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

192
00:23:57,777 --> 00:24:01,477
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

193
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:05,861
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

194
00:24:06,118 --> 00:24:07,661
Stand back.

195
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:38,726
Best not to mention this to anyone.

196
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,073
I still need a wand.

197
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:54,704
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

198
00:24:55,417 --> 00:25:00,542
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.

199
00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:20,351
Hello?

200
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,146
Hello?

201
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:32,952
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

202
00:25:40,753 --> 00:25:42,959
It seems only yesterday...

203
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:49,050
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

204
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:58,015
Here we are.

205
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:09,149
Give it a wave.

206
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,158
Apparently not.

207
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,797
Perhaps...

208
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:31,626
...this.

209
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:43,312
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

210
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,155
I wonder...

211
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:23,640
Curious.

212
00:27:23,854 --> 00:27:26,772
Very curious.

213
00:27:26,982 --> 00:27:30,102
Sorry, but what's curious?

214
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,106
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

215
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:38,075
It so happens that the phoenix...

216
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:42,995
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

217
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:46,499
Just one other.

218
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:51,041
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

219
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:56,969
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

220
00:27:58,806 --> 00:28:02,009
And who owned that wand?

221
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:05,259
We do not speak his name.

222
00:28:05,729 --> 00:28:09,229
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

223
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:12,442
It's not always clear why.

224
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:16,318
But I think it is clear...

225
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:20,447
...that we can expect
great things from you.

226
00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:24,907
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

227
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,835
...did great things.

228
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:30,036
Terrible...

229
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:33,754
...yes, but great.

230
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:41,427
Harry! Harry!

231
00:28:41,806 --> 00:28:44,178
Happy birthday.

232
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:54,815
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

233
00:28:55,195 --> 00:29:00,781
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

234
00:29:00,992 --> 00:29:04,610
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

235
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:13,042
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

236
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,791
Not all wizards are good.

237
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:18,497
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

238
00:29:18,718 --> 00:29:23,712
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V...

239
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:27,550
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

240
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,643
No, I can't spell it.

241
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:34,102
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

242
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:40,313
It was dark times, Harry.

243
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:45,736
<i>Voldemort started
to gather some followers.</i>

244
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:49,328
<i>Brought them over to the Dark Side.</i>

245
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:53,827
<i>Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.</i>

246
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:57,998
<i>Your parents fought against him.</i>

247
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:01,999
<i>But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.</i>

248
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,963
<i>Nobody, not one.</i>

249
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,557
<i>Except you.</i>

250
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:17,691
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

251
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:22,315
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

252
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:28,367
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

253
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:32,196
What happened to V?
To You-Know-Who?

254
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,701
Well, some say he died.

255
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,326
Codswallop, in my opinion.

256
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:42,798
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

257
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,963
...too tired to carry on.

258
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:51,599
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

259
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:56,098
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

260
00:30:56,565 --> 00:31:00,230
You're the boy who lived.

261
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,281
What are you looking at?

262
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,032
Blimey, is that the time?

263
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:20,248
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

264
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:25,338
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

265
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:30,889
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

266
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,009
"Platform 93/4"?

267
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:41,020
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 93/4.

268
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,566
There's no such thing, is there?

269
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,666
Sorry.

270
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:08,926
Excuse me. Excuse me.

271
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,677
On your left.

272
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,713
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 93/4?

273
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,470
Think you're being funny, do you?

274
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,018
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

275
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,850
- Muggles?
- Platform 93/4, this way.

276
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,698
All right, Percy, you first.

277
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,867
Fred, you next.

278
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:48,788
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

279
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,965
I'm sorry, George.

280
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:57,504
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

281
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,887
Excuse me.

282
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,771
Could you tell me how to?

283
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,522
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

284
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,196
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

285
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:22,329
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

286
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,992
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

287
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:27,849
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

288
00:34:28,064 --> 00:34:30,270
Not at all.

289
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,768
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

290
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,651
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

291
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:42,073
So it's true!

292
00:34:42,285 --> 00:34:45,072
I mean, do you really have the?

293
00:34:45,664 --> 00:34:48,534
- The what?
- The scar?

294
00:34:51,712 --> 00:34:53,918
Wicked!

295
00:34:56,383 --> 00:35:01,543
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

296
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,889
We'll take the lot.

297
00:35:18,613 --> 00:35:23,405
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

298
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:27,196
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

299
00:35:27,413 --> 00:35:31,245
...spinach, liver and tripe.

300
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,623
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

301
00:35:40,302 --> 00:35:45,640
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

302
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:51,305
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

303
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:55,102
Watch it!

304
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:00,893
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

305
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:07,696
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

306
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:10,997
Hey, he's gone!

307
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:14,658
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

308
00:36:15,295 --> 00:36:18,413
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

309
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,793
A little.

310
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:23,341
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

311
00:36:23,552 --> 00:36:25,591
Yeah.

312
00:36:32,352 --> 00:36:33,977
Has anyone seen a toad?

313
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:37,023
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

314
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:41,936
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

315
00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:47,318
<i>Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow</i>

316
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:50,660
<i>Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow</i>

317
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:59,038
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

318
00:36:59,254 --> 00:37:02,505
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

319
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:05,337
...but they've all worked for me.

320
00:37:08,972 --> 00:37:11,012
For example:

321
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:14,178
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

322
00:37:16,271 --> 00:37:18,892
That's better, isn't it?

323
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:23,981
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

324
00:37:24,196 --> 00:37:27,778
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are?

325
00:37:28,492 --> 00:37:31,695
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

326
00:37:31,911 --> 00:37:36,988
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

327
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:44,580
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

328
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,756
Just there.

329
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:02,889
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

330
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:08,315
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

331
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:18,282
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

332
00:38:19,374 --> 00:38:23,703
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

333
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:11,216
Wicked.

334
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:41,611
Welcome to Hogwarts.

335
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:45,828
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

336
00:39:46,043 --> 00:39:51,084
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

337
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:54,418
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

338
00:39:54,635 --> 00:39:59,096
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

339
00:39:59,515 --> 00:40:04,557
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

340
00:40:05,187 --> 00:40:08,686
Your triumphs will earn you points.

341
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:13,027
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

342
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:18,527
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

343
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:20,065
Trevor!

344
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:30,627
Sorry.

345
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:34,787
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

346
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:39,468
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

347
00:40:39,888 --> 00:40:42,509
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

348
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:44,134
Harry Potter?

349
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:47,437
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

350
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,934
And I'm Malfoy.

351
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:52,598
Draco Malfoy.

352
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:58,152
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

353
00:40:58,364 --> 00:41:04,154
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

354
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,123
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

355
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:13,117
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

356
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,495
I can help you there.

357
00:41:17,716 --> 00:41:21,548
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

358
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,391
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

359
00:41:47,997 --> 00:41:52,493
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

360
00:41:52,835 --> 00:41:55,705
<i>I read about it
in Hogwarts, A History.</i>

361
00:42:08,976 --> 00:42:11,811
Will you wait along here, please?

362
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,017
Now, before we begin...

363
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:19,482
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

364
00:42:19,695 --> 00:42:24,486
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

365
00:42:24,865 --> 00:42:26,989
The first years, please note...

366
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:33,288
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

367
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:39,045
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

368
00:42:39,254 --> 00:42:43,881
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

369
00:42:44,176 --> 00:42:48,389
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

370
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:51,722
Thank you.

371
00:42:53,478 --> 00:42:57,558
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

372
00:42:57,773 --> 00:43:01,392
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

373
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:04,814
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

374
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:07,652
Hermione Granger.

375
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:12,531
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

376
00:43:12,914 --> 00:43:16,282
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

377
00:43:21,756 --> 00:43:25,624
Right, then. Right.

378
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:29,426
Okay. Gryffindor!

379
00:43:38,229 --> 00:43:41,017
Draco Malfoy.

380
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,776
Slytherin!

381
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,657
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

382
00:43:51,868 --> 00:43:54,406
Susan Bones.

383
00:44:02,963 --> 00:44:05,086
Harry, what is it?

384
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,044
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

385
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:09,711
Let's see...

386
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,299
I know! Hufflepuff!

387
00:44:16,058 --> 00:44:18,465
Ronald Weasley.

388
00:44:32,326 --> 00:44:37,320
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

389
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,328
Gryffindor!

390
00:44:46,547 --> 00:44:49,039
Harry Potter.

391
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:10,109
Difficult, very difficult.

392
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:14,270
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

393
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:16,780
There's talent, oh, yes.

394
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:20,826
And a thirst to prove yourself.

395
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:23,198
But where to put you?

396
00:45:23,792 --> 00:45:26,282
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

397
00:45:26,545 --> 00:45:30,163
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

398
00:45:30,382 --> 00:45:35,257
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

399
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:40,808
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

400
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:45,768
No? Well, if you're sure.

401
00:45:45,981 --> 00:45:47,724
Better be...

402
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,898
...Gryffindor!

403
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:18,213
Your attention, please.

404
00:46:20,265 --> 00:46:22,970
Let the feast begin.

405
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:41,451
I'm half and half.

406
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,910
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

407
00:46:45,122 --> 00:46:48,621
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

408
00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:53,410
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

409
00:46:53,755 --> 00:46:56,874
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

410
00:46:57,092 --> 00:46:59,002
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

411
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:04,806
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

412
00:47:09,312 --> 00:47:11,637
Hello! How are you?

413
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:15,267
Welcome to Gryffindor.

414
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,861
It's the Bloody Baron!

415
00:47:32,503 --> 00:47:35,290
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

416
00:47:35,506 --> 00:47:40,926
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

417
00:47:43,972 --> 00:47:46,889
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

418
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,852
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

419
00:47:50,061 --> 00:47:53,561
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

420
00:47:53,898 --> 00:47:55,855
Like this.

421
00:48:05,868 --> 00:48:09,700
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

422
00:48:09,914 --> 00:48:14,243
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

423
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:17,835
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

424
00:48:18,047 --> 00:48:22,210
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

425
00:48:31,351 --> 00:48:37,139
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

426
00:48:37,357 --> 00:48:40,026
That picture's moving.

427
00:48:40,235 --> 00:48:43,734
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

428
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:47,816
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

429
00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:50,572
Welcome to Hogwarts.

430
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:08,172
Password?

431
00:49:08,638 --> 00:49:11,426
Caput Draconis.

432
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:23,065
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

433
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:28,188
Gather around here.

434
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:33,194
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

435
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:37,825
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

436
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:41,162
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

437
00:50:49,363 --> 00:50:50,987
Made it!

438
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:55,610
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

439
00:50:58,872 --> 00:51:03,829
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

440
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:08,337
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

441
00:51:08,547 --> 00:51:11,751
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

442
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:17,722
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

443
00:51:25,898 --> 00:51:31,568
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

444
00:51:31,779 --> 00:51:35,397
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

445
00:51:35,658 --> 00:51:39,358
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

446
00:51:39,578 --> 00:51:42,662
However, for those select few...

447
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:46,915
...who possess the predisposition...

448
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:53,875
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

449
00:51:54,093 --> 00:51:57,010
...and ensnare the senses.

450
00:51:57,221 --> 00:51:59,760
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

451
00:51:59,974 --> 00:52:05,893
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

452
00:52:09,942 --> 00:52:14,817
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

453
00:52:15,029 --> 00:52:20,984
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

454
00:52:21,202 --> 00:52:24,156
...to not pay attention.

455
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:32,702
Mr. Potter.

456
00:52:33,924 --> 00:52:37,756
Our new celebrity.

457
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:45,718
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

458
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,387
You don't know? Let's try again.

459
00:52:51,607 --> 00:52:56,233
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

460
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:58,905
I don't know, sir.

461
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:03,030
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

462
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,821
I don't know, sir.

463
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:10,196
Pity.

464
00:53:11,919 --> 00:53:16,130
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

465
00:53:16,882 --> 00:53:19,669
...is it, Mr. Potter?

466
00:53:21,845 --> 00:53:27,468
<i>Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum</i>

467
00:53:28,686 --> 00:53:30,227
<i>Eye of rabbit...</i>

468
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:33,231
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

469
00:53:33,482 --> 00:53:38,191
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

470
00:53:44,911 --> 00:53:46,819
Mail's here.

471
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:22,064
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

472
00:54:25,992 --> 00:54:28,198
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

473
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:33,915
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

474
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:37,625
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

475
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,335
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

476
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:45,213
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

477
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:51,174
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

478
00:54:51,392 --> 00:54:57,097
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

479
00:54:57,315 --> 00:55:01,562
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

480
00:55:10,495 --> 00:55:14,242
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

481
00:55:14,456 --> 00:55:17,243
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

482
00:55:18,544 --> 00:55:20,999
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

483
00:55:21,213 --> 00:55:25,127
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

484
00:55:25,342 --> 00:55:30,930
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

485
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,096
Up!

486
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:34,299
Up.

487
00:55:35,811 --> 00:55:37,638
Up.

488
00:55:39,314 --> 00:55:40,939
Up. Up!

489
00:55:41,149 --> 00:55:43,141
With feeling.

490
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:53,949
Shut up, Harry.

491
00:55:54,203 --> 00:55:58,830
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

492
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:03,039
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

493
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:08,379
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

494
00:56:08,593 --> 00:56:12,425
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

495
00:56:12,638 --> 00:56:16,932
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

496
00:56:17,184 --> 00:56:20,304
On my whistle. Three, two...

497
00:56:22,731 --> 00:56:24,106
Mr. Longbottom.

498
00:56:28,738 --> 00:56:31,608
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

499
00:56:31,824 --> 00:56:33,069
Neville!

500
00:56:36,788 --> 00:56:39,458
Come back down this instant!

501
00:57:08,443 --> 00:57:10,815
Everyone out of the way!

502
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:18,527
Is he all right?

503
00:57:18,913 --> 00:57:24,583
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

504
00:57:25,877 --> 00:57:30,539
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

505
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:34,421
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

506
00:57:34,635 --> 00:57:39,878
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

507
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:42,009
Did you see his face?

508
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:46,058
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

509
00:57:46,272 --> 00:57:48,763
Give it here, Malfoy.

510
00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:53,309
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

511
00:57:57,493 --> 00:57:59,947
How about on the roof?

512
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:04,952
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

513
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:11,292
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

514
00:58:11,506 --> 00:58:14,424
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

515
00:58:14,717 --> 00:58:16,626
What an idiot.

516
00:58:19,973 --> 00:58:23,507
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

517
00:58:23,726 --> 00:58:25,849
Is that so?

518
00:58:28,981 --> 00:58:31,270
Have it your way, then.

519
00:59:04,016 --> 00:59:07,634
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

520
00:59:07,853 --> 00:59:09,892
Harry Potter!

521
00:59:10,856 --> 00:59:12,848
Follow me.

522
00:59:24,535 --> 00:59:26,777
You wait here.

523
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:33,831
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

524
00:59:34,045 --> 00:59:35,872
Yes, of course.

525
00:59:41,554 --> 00:59:47,307
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

526
00:59:49,394 --> 00:59:52,893
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

527
00:59:53,148 --> 00:59:55,354
I always knew he'd do well.

528
00:59:55,817 --> 00:59:59,861
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

529
01:00:00,071 --> 01:00:04,567
- You must be the youngest player in...
- A century, McGonagall says.

530
01:00:04,783 --> 01:00:07,405
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

531
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,110
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

532
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:14,030
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

533
01:00:14,251 --> 01:00:16,921
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

534
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:21,079
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

535
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:24,052
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

536
01:00:24,303 --> 01:00:29,926
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

537
01:00:30,142 --> 01:00:33,344
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

538
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:38,562
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

539
01:00:47,116 --> 01:00:50,948
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

540
01:00:51,788 --> 01:00:53,994
I didn't know.

541
01:00:58,504 --> 01:01:03,083
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

542
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,588
Who doesn't?

543
01:01:06,512 --> 01:01:08,635
What's happening?

544
01:01:08,847 --> 01:01:13,058
The staircases change, remember?

545
01:01:18,522 --> 01:01:22,983
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

546
01:01:30,618 --> 01:01:34,034
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

547
01:01:34,288 --> 01:01:36,412
We're not supposed to be here.

548
01:01:36,624 --> 01:01:40,539
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

549
01:01:41,713 --> 01:01:43,290
Let's go.

550
01:01:45,508 --> 01:01:48,378
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

551
01:01:52,181 --> 01:01:55,514
Quick, let's hide through that door!

552
01:02:00,647 --> 01:02:02,687
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

553
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,059
Move over!

554
01:02:06,028 --> 01:02:08,151
<i>Alohomora.</i>

555
01:02:09,031 --> 01:02:10,940
Get in.

556
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,280
<i>Alohomora?</i>

557
01:02:13,494 --> 01:02:16,031
<i>Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.</i>

558
01:02:16,246 --> 01:02:19,615
Anyone here, my sweet?

559
01:02:25,881 --> 01:02:26,876
Come on.

560
01:02:27,757 --> 01:02:30,213
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

561
01:02:30,469 --> 01:02:34,087
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

562
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:05,245
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

563
01:03:05,461 --> 01:03:09,126
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

564
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:13,504
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

565
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,590
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

566
01:03:16,806 --> 01:03:20,471
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

567
01:03:20,685 --> 01:03:24,219
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

568
01:03:24,647 --> 01:03:28,395
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

569
01:03:28,609 --> 01:03:32,227
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

570
01:03:32,446 --> 01:03:35,566
Or worse, expelled.

571
01:03:38,827 --> 01:03:43,074
She needs to sort out her priorities.

572
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:51,921
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

573
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:57,838
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

574
01:04:02,935 --> 01:04:07,063
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

575
01:04:07,273 --> 01:04:13,227
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

576
01:04:13,445 --> 01:04:17,823
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

577
01:04:18,033 --> 01:04:22,493
I think so. What are those?

578
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:26,947
You better take this.

579
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,797
Careful now, it's coming back.

580
01:04:46,394 --> 01:04:50,012
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

581
01:05:06,665 --> 01:05:08,952
What was that?

582
01:05:09,709 --> 01:05:13,457
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

583
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:17,170
But you are a Seeker.

584
01:05:20,761 --> 01:05:25,339
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

585
01:05:25,598 --> 01:05:28,089
The Golden Snitch.

586
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:31,310
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

587
01:05:31,522 --> 01:05:35,520
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

588
01:05:35,734 --> 01:05:37,691
What do I do with it?

589
01:05:37,903 --> 01:05:41,153
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

590
01:05:41,408 --> 01:05:43,862
You catch this, the game's over.

591
01:05:44,076 --> 01:05:48,026
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

592
01:05:57,089 --> 01:06:02,427
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

593
01:06:02,636 --> 01:06:06,585
...or the ability to make objects fly.

594
01:06:06,806 --> 01:06:09,213
Do you have your feathers? Good.

595
01:06:09,476 --> 01:06:14,600
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

596
01:06:14,815 --> 01:06:18,148
The swish and flick. Everyone.

597
01:06:18,694 --> 01:06:24,316
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

598
01:06:25,032 --> 01:06:29,326
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.</i>

599
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:32,862
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

600
01:06:33,124 --> 01:06:35,449
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

601
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:43,543
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

602
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:49,755
<i>Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.</i>

603
01:06:50,348 --> 01:06:54,559
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

604
01:06:55,813 --> 01:06:58,897
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

605
01:07:06,407 --> 01:07:12,031
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

606
01:07:12,246 --> 01:07:13,906
Splendid!

607
01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:17,705
Well done, dear.

608
01:07:21,921 --> 01:07:26,002
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

609
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:36,763
<i>"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."</i>

610
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:42,359
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

611
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:45,564
I think she heard you.

612
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,300
Where's Hermione?

613
01:08:16,518 --> 01:08:19,636
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

614
01:08:19,854 --> 01:08:23,934
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

615
01:08:28,361 --> 01:08:32,026
Troll in the dungeon!

616
01:08:32,284 --> 01:08:35,616
Troll in the dungeon!

617
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,739
Thought you ought to know.

618
01:08:47,632 --> 01:08:50,467
Silence!

619
01:08:52,052 --> 01:08:56,097
Everyone will please not panic!

620
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:58,343
Now...

621
01:08:58,559 --> 01:09:03,101
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

622
01:09:03,813 --> 01:09:08,606
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

623
01:09:19,663 --> 01:09:22,830
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

624
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:24,785
How could a troll get in?

625
01:09:25,002 --> 01:09:30,162
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

626
01:09:30,382 --> 01:09:34,380
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

627
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:49,730
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

628
01:09:53,613 --> 01:09:55,771
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

629
01:10:26,812 --> 01:10:29,184
Hermione, move!

630
01:10:32,568 --> 01:10:36,696
Help! Help!

631
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:40,775
Hey, pea brain!

632
01:10:53,213 --> 01:10:55,086
Help!

633
01:11:16,235 --> 01:11:18,608
Do something!

634
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:23,981
- What?
- Anything!

635
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:27,026
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

636
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:29,571
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

637
01:11:40,511 --> 01:11:42,503
Cool.

638
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:09,745
Is it dead?

639
01:12:09,955 --> 01:12:13,869
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

640
01:12:20,132 --> 01:12:22,457
Troll boogers.

641
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:28,505
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

642
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:33,350
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

643
01:12:35,522 --> 01:12:36,720
Miss Granger?

644
01:12:37,607 --> 01:12:42,684
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

645
01:12:42,904 --> 01:12:44,778
But I was wrong.

646
01:12:44,989 --> 01:12:50,030
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

647
01:12:51,036 --> 01:12:55,449
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

648
01:12:55,667 --> 01:13:01,337
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

649
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:04,549
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

650
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,342
...for your serious lack of judgment.

651
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:10,798
As for you two gentlemen...

652
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:14,432
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

653
01:13:14,644 --> 01:13:18,060
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

654
01:13:18,272 --> 01:13:20,894
...and live to tell the tale.

655
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,558
Five points...

656
01:13:24,945 --> 01:13:28,065
...will be awarded to each of you...

657
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:32,744
...for sheer dumb luck.

658
01:13:38,334 --> 01:13:42,082
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

659
01:13:49,956 --> 01:13:52,708
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

660
01:13:52,918 --> 01:13:56,120
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

661
01:13:56,338 --> 01:13:58,544
I'm not hungry.

662
01:13:59,132 --> 01:14:04,755
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

663
01:14:04,971 --> 01:14:08,138
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

664
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:11,470
Even if it is against Slytherin.

665
01:14:19,152 --> 01:14:22,568
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

666
01:14:22,989 --> 01:14:27,117
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

667
01:14:27,326 --> 01:14:29,996
...so he could get past that dog.

668
01:14:30,204 --> 01:14:32,956
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

669
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:35,414
But why would anyone go near that dog?

670
01:14:36,085 --> 01:14:39,336
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

671
01:14:39,547 --> 01:14:42,797
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

672
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:44,124
You're saying...

673
01:14:44,345 --> 01:14:48,840
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

674
01:15:01,987 --> 01:15:05,935
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

675
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:08,033
Let's open it.

676
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:19,456
It's a broomstick.

677
01:15:20,254 --> 01:15:24,382
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

678
01:15:25,843 --> 01:15:27,882
But who?

679
01:15:49,532 --> 01:15:52,023
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

680
01:15:52,243 --> 01:15:55,908
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

681
01:15:56,122 --> 01:15:59,622
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

682
01:15:59,918 --> 01:16:02,587
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

683
01:16:02,796 --> 01:16:05,631
Woke up in hospital a week later.

684
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:31,189
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

685
01:16:31,408 --> 01:16:36,117
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

686
01:17:06,401 --> 01:17:08,856
The players take their positions...

687
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:12,854
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

688
01:17:13,074 --> 01:17:16,407
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

689
01:17:17,035 --> 01:17:19,443
...from all of you!

690
01:17:24,584 --> 01:17:27,502
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

691
01:17:27,712 --> 01:17:30,417
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

692
01:17:30,631 --> 01:17:34,415
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

693
01:17:40,558 --> 01:17:44,687
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

694
01:18:03,373 --> 01:18:08,165
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

695
01:18:13,341 --> 01:18:14,621
Well done!

696
01:18:19,013 --> 01:18:24,719
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

697
01:18:56,758 --> 01:18:59,546
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

698
01:19:13,358 --> 01:19:15,232
Give me that!

699
01:19:46,683 --> 01:19:49,305
Take that side!

700
01:20:38,776 --> 01:20:42,026
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

701
01:20:50,955 --> 01:20:53,161
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

702
01:20:53,374 --> 01:20:57,751
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

703
01:21:19,524 --> 01:21:21,066
Come on, Hermione!

704
01:21:35,164 --> 01:21:38,913
<i>Lacarnum Inflamarae.</i>

705
01:21:46,008 --> 01:21:49,044
Fire! You're on fire!

706
01:22:06,904 --> 01:22:09,063
Go, go, go, go!

707
01:23:01,082 --> 01:23:03,407
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

708
01:23:04,501 --> 01:23:05,960
He's got the Snitch!

709
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:10,250
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

710
01:23:10,467 --> 01:23:12,127
Gryffindor wins!

711
01:23:55,719 --> 01:23:59,967
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

712
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:04,096
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

713
01:24:04,312 --> 01:24:06,718
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

714
01:24:06,938 --> 01:24:10,603
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

715
01:24:10,817 --> 01:24:16,108
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard...

716
01:24:16,322 --> 01:24:20,901
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

717
01:24:21,495 --> 01:24:25,493
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

718
01:24:25,707 --> 01:24:29,159
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

719
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:34,746
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

720
01:24:34,966 --> 01:24:38,549
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

721
01:24:38,762 --> 01:24:41,003
Exactly.

722
01:24:41,681 --> 01:24:44,433
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

723
01:24:44,642 --> 01:24:49,304
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

724
01:24:49,522 --> 01:24:54,598
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

725
01:24:54,819 --> 01:24:56,229
Nicholas Flamel?

726
01:24:57,238 --> 01:25:01,947
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

727
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:06,240
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

728
01:25:06,456 --> 01:25:08,449
I don't know.

729
01:25:27,309 --> 01:25:30,144
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

730
01:25:30,395 --> 01:25:33,182
<i>Ring the Hogwart bell</i>

731
01:25:33,399 --> 01:25:36,186
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

732
01:25:36,402 --> 01:25:39,320
<i>Cast a Christmas spell</i>

733
01:25:52,918 --> 01:25:56,252
Knight to e5.

734
01:26:03,928 --> 01:26:06,086
Queen to e5.

735
01:26:11,729 --> 01:26:13,139
That's totally barbaric!

736
01:26:13,772 --> 01:26:17,306
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

737
01:26:17,525 --> 01:26:18,984
I see you haven't.

738
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:24,485
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

739
01:26:24,699 --> 01:26:28,531
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

740
01:26:28,744 --> 01:26:32,113
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

741
01:26:32,331 --> 01:26:35,830
We've looked a hundred times!

742
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:41,703
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

743
01:26:43,927 --> 01:26:46,844
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

744
01:26:49,391 --> 01:26:53,720
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

745
01:27:03,571 --> 01:27:06,905
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

746
01:27:07,116 --> 01:27:09,322
What are you wearing?

747
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:13,611
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

748
01:27:14,748 --> 01:27:17,156
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

749
01:27:24,592 --> 01:27:26,667
There they are.

750
01:27:37,688 --> 01:27:41,187
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

751
01:27:41,441 --> 01:27:45,569
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

752
01:28:02,379 --> 01:28:06,079
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

753
01:28:06,383 --> 01:28:09,299
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

754
01:28:14,725 --> 01:28:16,004
My body's gone!

755
01:28:16,226 --> 01:28:19,809
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

756
01:28:20,355 --> 01:28:22,264
I'm invisible?

757
01:28:22,732 --> 01:28:27,145
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

758
01:28:27,611 --> 01:28:32,404
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

759
01:29:00,477 --> 01:29:06,349
<i>Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.</i>

760
01:29:06,566 --> 01:29:12,402
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

761
01:29:31,215 --> 01:29:33,125
Who's there?

762
01:29:39,266 --> 01:29:44,889
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

763
01:29:52,279 --> 01:29:56,027
Who is it? Show yourself.

764
01:30:43,203 --> 01:30:44,578
Severus, I...

765
01:30:45,247 --> 01:30:49,114
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

766
01:30:49,334 --> 01:30:54,043
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

767
01:31:11,273 --> 01:31:14,477
We'll have another little chat soon.

768
01:31:14,694 --> 01:31:20,149
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

769
01:31:20,407 --> 01:31:24,819
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

770
01:31:25,370 --> 01:31:30,411
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

771
01:33:02,507 --> 01:33:04,334
Mum?

772
01:33:07,595 --> 01:33:09,588
Dad?

773
01:33:44,339 --> 01:33:49,298
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

774
01:33:51,138 --> 01:33:54,008
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

775
01:33:54,224 --> 01:33:57,807
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

776
01:34:04,527 --> 01:34:08,820
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

777
01:34:10,283 --> 01:34:12,240
I only see us.

778
01:34:12,493 --> 01:34:15,827
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

779
01:34:16,038 --> 01:34:21,957
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

780
01:34:22,461 --> 01:34:24,786
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

781
01:34:25,047 --> 01:34:29,210
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

782
01:34:30,343 --> 01:34:32,799
I look good.

783
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:37,262
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

784
01:34:37,476 --> 01:34:42,434
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

785
01:35:05,586 --> 01:35:07,744
Back again, Harry?

786
01:35:10,842 --> 01:35:13,332
I see that you,
like many before you...

787
01:35:13,553 --> 01:35:17,717
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

788
01:35:18,058 --> 01:35:22,221
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

789
01:35:23,521 --> 01:35:26,058
Let me give you a clue.

790
01:35:26,608 --> 01:35:28,730
The happiest man on earth...

791
01:35:28,942 --> 01:35:32,312
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

792
01:35:32,529 --> 01:35:34,854
...exactly as he is.

793
01:35:35,073 --> 01:35:40,114
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

794
01:35:40,329 --> 01:35:43,081
Yes. And no.

795
01:35:44,125 --> 01:35:46,580
It shows us nothing more or less...

796
01:35:46,794 --> 01:35:52,749
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

797
01:35:52,968 --> 01:35:57,676
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

798
01:35:57,889 --> 01:36:01,756
...you see them standing beside you.

799
01:36:01,976 --> 01:36:04,383
But remember this, Harry.

800
01:36:04,645 --> 01:36:10,517
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

801
01:36:10,734 --> 01:36:12,857
...or truth.

802
01:36:13,821 --> 01:36:19,858
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

803
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:25,039
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

804
01:36:25,249 --> 01:36:27,158
And I must ask you...

805
01:36:28,126 --> 01:36:31,993
...not to go looking for it again.

806
01:36:32,756 --> 01:36:35,875
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

807
01:36:36,468 --> 01:36:39,338
...and forget to live.

808
01:37:34,066 --> 01:37:39,736
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

809
01:37:39,989 --> 01:37:43,074
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

810
01:37:43,284 --> 01:37:45,276
This is light?

811
01:37:49,873 --> 01:37:52,281
Of course! Here it is!

812
01:37:52,501 --> 01:37:56,499
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

813
01:37:56,755 --> 01:37:57,917
The what?

814
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:01,591
Honestly, don't you two read?

815
01:38:01,801 --> 01:38:06,297
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

816
01:38:06,514 --> 01:38:09,135
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

817
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:13,348
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

818
01:38:13,562 --> 01:38:15,720
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

819
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:18,017
I know what it means!

820
01:38:18,902 --> 01:38:23,610
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

821
01:38:23,823 --> 01:38:28,983
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

822
01:38:30,704 --> 01:38:32,862
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

823
01:38:33,082 --> 01:38:37,791
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

824
01:38:54,562 --> 01:38:58,346
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

825
01:38:58,566 --> 01:39:01,271
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

826
01:39:05,991 --> 01:39:11,114
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?

827
01:39:11,328 --> 01:39:14,115
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

828
01:39:14,498 --> 01:39:18,661
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

829
01:39:18,919 --> 01:39:19,998
What?

830
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:23,585
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

831
01:39:23,799 --> 01:39:26,468
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

832
01:39:26,677 --> 01:39:30,544
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

833
01:39:30,764 --> 01:39:33,386
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

834
01:39:33,642 --> 01:39:36,679
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

835
01:39:36,896 --> 01:39:38,971
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

836
01:39:39,189 --> 01:39:42,854
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

837
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:46,692
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

838
01:40:00,543 --> 01:40:05,619
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

839
01:40:05,882 --> 01:40:07,874
I know what that is!

840
01:40:08,093 --> 01:40:10,713
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

841
01:40:11,095 --> 01:40:14,345
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

842
01:40:14,558 --> 01:40:18,638
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

843
01:40:40,876 --> 01:40:43,082
Is that...

844
01:40:43,878 --> 01:40:45,041
...a dragon?

845
01:40:45,255 --> 01:40:49,667
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

846
01:40:49,884 --> 01:40:52,755
My brother works
with these in Romania.

847
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:57,846
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

848
01:40:58,517 --> 01:41:00,261
Hello, Norbert.

849
01:41:00,602 --> 01:41:04,896
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

850
01:41:05,648 --> 01:41:08,104
Don't you, Norbert?

851
01:41:15,076 --> 01:41:18,195
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

852
01:41:22,082 --> 01:41:24,158
Who's that?

853
01:41:25,877 --> 01:41:27,954
Malfoy.

854
01:41:28,713 --> 01:41:30,123
Oh, dear.

855
01:41:31,841 --> 01:41:36,633
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

856
01:41:36,846 --> 01:41:40,890
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

857
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:45,180
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.

858
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,639
Good evening.

859
01:41:51,278 --> 01:41:54,196
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

860
01:41:54,448 --> 01:41:57,947
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

861
01:41:58,159 --> 01:42:03,035
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

862
01:42:03,248 --> 01:42:05,573
- 50?!
- Each.

863
01:42:06,626 --> 01:42:08,998
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

864
01:42:09,212 --> 01:42:12,545
...all four of you
will receive detention.

865
01:42:13,465 --> 01:42:16,419
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

866
01:42:16,635 --> 01:42:18,960
I thought you said the four of us.

867
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:21,671
No, you heard me correctly.

868
01:42:21,891 --> 01:42:26,885
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

869
01:42:27,355 --> 01:42:30,309
You will join your classmates
in detention.

870
01:42:41,535 --> 01:42:45,533
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

871
01:42:45,748 --> 01:42:50,456
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

872
01:42:50,669 --> 01:42:53,504
God, I miss the screaming.

873
01:42:56,049 --> 01:42:59,334
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

874
01:42:59,552 --> 01:43:04,891
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

875
01:43:06,976 --> 01:43:09,931
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

876
01:43:11,398 --> 01:43:16,392
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

877
01:43:18,656 --> 01:43:20,731
Norbert's gone.

878
01:43:21,283 --> 01:43:24,818
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

879
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:28,370
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

880
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:30,865
What if he don't like Romania?

881
01:43:31,084 --> 01:43:35,330
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

882
01:43:35,964 --> 01:43:41,206
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

883
01:43:41,428 --> 01:43:43,800
Got to have your wits about you.

884
01:43:44,014 --> 01:43:49,684
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

885
01:43:50,144 --> 01:43:53,976
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

886
01:43:55,525 --> 01:43:56,769
...werewolves.

887
01:43:57,192 --> 01:44:00,478
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

888
01:44:00,696 --> 01:44:03,365
You can be sure of that.

889
01:44:05,326 --> 01:44:06,736
Nighty-night.

890
01:44:09,330 --> 01:44:12,165
Right. Let's go.

891
01:44:50,370 --> 01:44:52,778
Hagrid, what is that?

892
01:44:52,999 --> 01:44:56,367
What we're here for.
See that?

893
01:44:56,877 --> 01:45:02,251
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

894
01:45:02,799 --> 01:45:07,378
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

895
01:45:14,894 --> 01:45:20,648
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

896
01:45:20,858 --> 01:45:23,978
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

897
01:45:24,445 --> 01:45:27,730
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

898
01:45:28,992 --> 01:45:31,280
Okay. Then I get Fang.

899
01:45:31,453 --> 01:45:37,206
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

900
01:45:40,878 --> 01:45:45,872
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

901
01:45:46,091 --> 01:45:50,006
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

902
01:45:50,221 --> 01:45:52,793
I'm not scared, Potter.

903
01:45:53,932 --> 01:45:55,890
Do you hear that?

904
01:45:58,437 --> 01:45:59,847
Come on, Fang.

905
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:01,558
Scared!

906
01:46:26,548 --> 01:46:28,706
What is it, Fang?

907
01:47:39,077 --> 01:47:44,581
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

908
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:48,789
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

909
01:47:49,005 --> 01:47:51,756
What was that thing you saved me from?

910
01:47:51,965 --> 01:47:57,304
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

911
01:47:57,513 --> 01:48:03,053
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

912
01:48:03,268 --> 01:48:08,345
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

913
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:13,393
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

914
01:48:13,612 --> 01:48:15,403
A cursed life.

915
01:48:15,614 --> 01:48:19,563
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

916
01:48:19,784 --> 01:48:24,743
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

917
01:48:25,081 --> 01:48:28,995
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

918
01:48:29,211 --> 01:48:34,371
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

919
01:48:35,217 --> 01:48:36,759
The Philosopher's Stone.

920
01:48:38,094 --> 01:48:40,087
Harry!

921
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:45,176
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

922
01:48:45,392 --> 01:48:47,552
You all right there, Harry?

923
01:48:48,688 --> 01:48:52,982
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

924
01:48:53,859 --> 01:48:57,691
You're safe now. Good luck.

925
01:49:05,328 --> 01:49:09,456
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

926
01:49:09,667 --> 01:49:12,454
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

927
01:49:12,670 --> 01:49:15,587
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

928
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:20,176
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

929
01:49:20,386 --> 01:49:24,929
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

930
01:49:25,141 --> 01:49:26,718
He'll come back.

931
01:49:26,934 --> 01:49:28,678
But if he comes back...

932
01:49:28,936 --> 01:49:32,886
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

933
01:49:33,899 --> 01:49:37,434
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

934
01:49:37,653 --> 01:49:41,235
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

935
01:49:41,447 --> 01:49:45,031
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

936
01:49:45,411 --> 01:49:50,286
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

937
01:49:51,042 --> 01:49:56,166
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

938
01:49:56,379 --> 01:50:00,424
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

939
01:50:06,181 --> 01:50:11,601
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

940
01:50:11,811 --> 01:50:15,476
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

941
01:50:15,689 --> 01:50:20,849
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

942
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:23,739
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

943
01:50:23,949 --> 01:50:27,448
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

944
01:50:35,084 --> 01:50:37,540
- Of course!
- What is it?

945
01:50:37,753 --> 01:50:41,501
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

946
01:50:41,715 --> 01:50:44,799
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

947
01:50:45,011 --> 01:50:47,680
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

948
01:50:47,888 --> 01:50:50,131
Why didn't I see it before?

949
01:50:55,730 --> 01:50:59,230
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

950
01:50:59,442 --> 01:51:02,194
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

951
01:51:02,404 --> 01:51:04,976
You and this stranger
must have talked.

952
01:51:05,573 --> 01:51:09,108
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

953
01:51:09,327 --> 01:51:13,324
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

954
01:51:13,539 --> 01:51:18,000
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

955
01:51:18,418 --> 01:51:22,582
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

956
01:51:22,797 --> 01:51:28,421
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

957
01:51:28,636 --> 01:51:34,093
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

958
01:51:35,727 --> 01:51:38,433
I shouldn't have told you that.

959
01:51:38,689 --> 01:51:40,895
Where are you going?

960
01:51:47,906 --> 01:51:50,657
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

961
01:51:51,117 --> 01:51:53,739
I'm afraid he's not here.

962
01:51:53,953 --> 01:51:58,246
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

963
01:51:58,666 --> 01:52:01,203
He's gone?
But this is important!

964
01:52:01,461 --> 01:52:03,667
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

965
01:52:05,589 --> 01:52:09,289
- How do you know?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

966
01:52:09,928 --> 01:52:15,134
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

967
01:52:15,349 --> 01:52:19,643
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

968
01:52:27,945 --> 01:52:30,732
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

969
01:52:30,948 --> 01:52:33,617
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

970
01:52:33,826 --> 01:52:37,694
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

971
01:52:39,749 --> 01:52:42,832
What would three young Gryffindors...

972
01:52:43,086 --> 01:52:47,379
...be doing inside on a day like this?

973
01:52:52,136 --> 01:52:55,671
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.

974
01:52:56,223 --> 01:52:58,181
People will think you're...

975
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:05,183
...up to something.

976
01:53:15,492 --> 01:53:17,484
Now what do we do?

977
01:53:17,702 --> 01:53:21,450
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

978
01:53:35,219 --> 01:53:36,678
Trevor.

979
01:53:37,013 --> 01:53:40,428
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

980
01:53:40,683 --> 01:53:46,104
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

981
01:53:46,314 --> 01:53:50,264
- Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!

982
01:53:50,526 --> 01:53:55,105
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

983
01:53:55,324 --> 01:53:59,618
<i>Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.</i>

984
01:54:07,585 --> 01:54:11,369
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

985
01:54:11,631 --> 01:54:15,249
Brilliant, but scary.

986
01:54:15,927 --> 01:54:17,966
Let's go.

987
01:54:18,179 --> 01:54:22,426
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

988
01:54:27,855 --> 01:54:31,805
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

989
01:54:35,696 --> 01:54:37,736
<i>Alohomora.</i>

990
01:54:49,751 --> 01:54:52,325
Wait a minute. He's...

991
01:54:53,547 --> 01:54:55,705
...snoring.

992
01:54:58,218 --> 01:55:03,757
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

993
01:55:05,349 --> 01:55:08,350
It's got horrible breath.

994
01:55:10,938 --> 01:55:13,015
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

995
01:55:13,233 --> 01:55:14,644
Come on!

996
01:55:18,698 --> 01:55:20,773
Okay. Push.

997
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:47,549
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

998
01:55:47,768 --> 01:55:52,762
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

999
01:55:53,564 --> 01:55:57,016
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1000
01:55:57,735 --> 01:55:59,562
The harp.

1001
01:56:00,237 --> 01:56:02,942
It's stopped playing.

1002
01:56:12,999 --> 01:56:14,114
Jump!

1003
01:56:28,306 --> 01:56:31,925
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1004
01:56:46,365 --> 01:56:49,449
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1005
01:56:49,662 --> 01:56:53,362
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1006
01:56:53,582 --> 01:56:58,576
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1007
01:57:00,839 --> 01:57:02,168
Hermione!

1008
01:57:02,758 --> 01:57:06,541
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1009
01:57:06,761 --> 01:57:11,257
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1010
01:57:18,356 --> 01:57:21,689
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1011
01:57:21,901 --> 01:57:24,937
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1012
01:57:25,154 --> 01:57:27,692
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1013
01:57:27,906 --> 01:57:30,824
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1014
01:57:31,702 --> 01:57:35,534
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1015
01:57:35,748 --> 01:57:40,125
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1016
01:57:40,378 --> 01:57:42,417
<i>Lumus Solem.</i>

1017
01:57:50,512 --> 01:57:53,086
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1018
01:57:55,809 --> 01:57:58,264
Lucky we didn't panic.

1019
01:57:59,021 --> 01:58:02,520
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1020
01:58:04,150 --> 01:58:05,644
What is that?

1021
01:58:05,861 --> 01:58:09,561
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1022
01:58:22,712 --> 01:58:26,163
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1023
01:58:26,382 --> 01:58:30,000
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1024
01:58:30,219 --> 01:58:33,669
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1025
01:58:37,142 --> 01:58:41,768
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1026
01:58:47,653 --> 01:58:49,692
Strange.

1027
01:58:50,113 --> 01:58:52,402
<i>Alohomora!</i>

1028
01:58:55,369 --> 01:58:57,610
Well, it was worth a try.

1029
01:58:57,829 --> 01:59:01,079
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1030
01:59:01,291 --> 01:59:05,204
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1031
01:59:05,419 --> 01:59:08,835
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1032
01:59:12,426 --> 01:59:14,751
What's wrong?

1033
01:59:15,637 --> 01:59:17,131
It's too simple.

1034
01:59:17,347 --> 01:59:22,093
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1035
01:59:22,311 --> 01:59:25,846
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1036
01:59:42,706 --> 01:59:45,706
This complicates things a bit.

1037
02:00:06,981 --> 02:00:08,890
Catch the key!

1038
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:15,230
Hurry up!

1039
02:00:47,729 --> 02:00:52,390
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1040
02:00:52,608 --> 02:00:55,775
Where are we? A graveyard.

1041
02:00:56,153 --> 02:00:58,774
This is no graveyard.

1042
02:01:06,287 --> 02:01:09,205
It's a chessboard.

1043
02:01:21,179 --> 02:01:23,088
There's the door.

1044
02:01:35,150 --> 02:01:36,645
Now what do we do?

1045
02:01:37,027 --> 02:01:41,155
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1046
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:45,488
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1047
02:01:45,828 --> 02:01:50,039
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1048
02:01:50,291 --> 02:01:54,335
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1049
02:02:01,509 --> 02:02:03,218
What happens now?

1050
02:02:04,012 --> 02:02:07,012
Well, white moves first.

1051
02:02:07,224 --> 02:02:09,097
And then...

1052
02:02:10,852 --> 02:02:12,097
...we play.

1053
02:02:22,698 --> 02:02:27,739
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1054
02:02:27,994 --> 02:02:31,529
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1055
02:02:31,915 --> 02:02:34,868
You there, d5.

1056
02:02:49,473 --> 02:02:51,051
Yes, Hermione.

1057
02:02:51,267 --> 02:02:56,343
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1058
02:03:02,279 --> 02:03:04,770
Castle to e4!

1059
02:03:08,409 --> 02:03:10,698
Pawn to c3!

1060
02:03:55,330 --> 02:03:59,327
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1061
02:03:59,584 --> 02:04:04,292
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1062
02:04:04,922 --> 02:04:07,247
Then you're free to check the king.

1063
02:04:07,466 --> 02:04:10,170
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1064
02:04:10,804 --> 02:04:15,465
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

1065
02:04:15,683 --> 02:04:19,431
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1066
02:04:19,646 --> 02:04:23,229
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1067
02:04:23,734 --> 02:04:26,485
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1068
02:04:36,745 --> 02:04:39,663
Knight to h3.

1069
02:05:00,602 --> 02:05:02,595
Check.

1070
02:05:31,758 --> 02:05:33,549
Ron!

1071
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:39,549
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1072
02:05:54,614 --> 02:05:55,894
Checkmate.

1073
02:06:15,844 --> 02:06:18,334
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1074
02:06:18,554 --> 02:06:22,421
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1075
02:06:22,641 --> 02:06:24,514
I have to go on.

1076
02:06:25,018 --> 02:06:30,938
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1077
02:06:31,149 --> 02:06:33,640
Not as good as you.

1078
02:06:34,486 --> 02:06:39,314
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1079
02:06:40,534 --> 02:06:46,158
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1080
02:07:24,244 --> 02:07:25,904
You?

1081
02:07:26,705 --> 02:07:30,537
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...

1082
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:33,786
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1083
02:07:34,003 --> 02:07:37,123
Next to him, who would suspect...

1084
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:41,254
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1085
02:07:41,469 --> 02:07:46,843
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1086
02:07:47,057 --> 02:07:49,845
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1087
02:07:50,353 --> 02:07:54,517
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1088
02:07:54,732 --> 02:07:56,938
...I would have succeeded.

1089
02:07:57,151 --> 02:08:00,152
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

1090
02:08:00,362 --> 02:08:02,569
Snape was trying to save me?

1091
02:08:02,782 --> 02:08:08,120
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

1092
02:08:08,329 --> 02:08:12,575
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1093
02:08:12,791 --> 02:08:15,791
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1094
02:08:16,378 --> 02:08:21,336
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1095
02:08:22,259 --> 02:08:25,758
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1096
02:08:26,764 --> 02:08:32,006
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1097
02:08:32,227 --> 02:08:36,271
I'm never alone. Never.

1098
02:08:36,482 --> 02:08:40,561
Now, what does this mirror do?

1099
02:08:42,153 --> 02:08:44,276
I see what I desire.

1100
02:08:44,822 --> 02:08:49,235
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1101
02:08:49,452 --> 02:08:51,610
Use the boy.

1102
02:08:52,414 --> 02:08:56,328
Come here, Potter! Now!

1103
02:09:08,430 --> 02:09:12,428
Tell me, what do you see?

1104
02:09:37,584 --> 02:09:39,991
What is it? What do you see?

1105
02:09:40,211 --> 02:09:45,371
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1106
02:09:45,591 --> 02:09:47,134
He lies.

1107
02:09:47,635 --> 02:09:51,335
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1108
02:09:51,555 --> 02:09:55,932
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1109
02:09:56,184 --> 02:10:00,182
I have strength enough for this.

1110
02:10:18,373 --> 02:10:21,244
Harry Potter...

1111
02:10:21,459 --> 02:10:23,784
...we meet again.

1112
02:10:24,004 --> 02:10:25,415
Voldemort.

1113
02:10:25,631 --> 02:10:29,581
Yes. You see what I've become?

1114
02:10:29,843 --> 02:10:33,425
See what I must do to survive?

1115
02:10:33,639 --> 02:10:37,766
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1116
02:10:38,435 --> 02:10:41,768
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1117
02:10:41,979 --> 02:10:45,644
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1118
02:10:45,858 --> 02:10:49,393
But there is something that can.

1119
02:10:49,613 --> 02:10:55,283
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1120
02:10:55,661 --> 02:10:57,202
Stop him!

1121
02:11:02,250 --> 02:11:05,001
Don't be a fool.

1122
02:11:05,503 --> 02:11:08,622
Why suffer an horrific death...

1123
02:11:08,839 --> 02:11:12,457
...when you can join me and live?

1124
02:11:12,676 --> 02:11:13,756
Never!

1125
02:11:15,763 --> 02:11:20,554
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1126
02:11:21,310 --> 02:11:24,595
Tell me, Harry...

1127
02:11:24,855 --> 02:11:28,722
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1128
02:11:28,984 --> 02:11:31,061
Together...

1129
02:11:31,278 --> 02:11:33,816
...we can bring them back.

1130
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:38,948
All I ask is for something in return.

1131
02:11:45,667 --> 02:11:48,787
That's it, Harry.

1132
02:11:49,671 --> 02:11:53,538
There is no good and evil.

1133
02:11:53,759 --> 02:11:56,760
There is only power...

1134
02:11:56,970 --> 02:12:01,098
...and those too weak to seek it.

1135
02:12:01,768 --> 02:12:06,809
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1136
02:12:07,231 --> 02:12:09,473
Just give me the Stone!

1137
02:12:12,110 --> 02:12:13,273
You liar!

1138
02:12:13,486 --> 02:12:15,610
Kill him!

1139
02:12:39,137 --> 02:12:44,475
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1140
02:14:29,745 --> 02:14:32,236
Good afternoon, Harry.

1141
02:14:34,375 --> 02:14:38,871
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1142
02:14:39,088 --> 02:14:45,091
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1143
02:14:45,302 --> 02:14:50,094
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1144
02:14:52,433 --> 02:14:56,052
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1145
02:14:56,271 --> 02:14:59,106
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1146
02:14:59,316 --> 02:15:02,317
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1147
02:15:02,529 --> 02:15:07,404
Fine. They're both just fine.

1148
02:15:07,992 --> 02:15:10,779
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1149
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:13,955
The Stone has been destroyed.

1150
02:15:14,206 --> 02:15:18,417
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1151
02:15:18,627 --> 02:15:22,576
...and agreed it was best all around.

1152
02:15:22,797 --> 02:15:26,629
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1153
02:15:28,678 --> 02:15:34,182
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1154
02:15:34,392 --> 02:15:37,595
But yes, he will die.

1155
02:15:37,812 --> 02:15:40,268
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1156
02:15:40,483 --> 02:15:43,020
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and...

1157
02:15:43,235 --> 02:15:47,315
You see, only a person...

1158
02:15:47,614 --> 02:15:51,528
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1159
02:15:51,785 --> 02:15:56,327
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1160
02:15:57,290 --> 02:16:00,789
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1161
02:16:01,002 --> 02:16:06,043
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1162
02:16:07,508 --> 02:16:12,715
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1163
02:16:12,930 --> 02:16:15,255
I'm afraid...

1164
02:16:16,684 --> 02:16:20,728
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1165
02:16:21,439 --> 02:16:24,011
Harry, do you know why...

1166
02:16:24,233 --> 02:16:28,231
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1167
02:16:28,446 --> 02:16:33,072
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1168
02:16:33,617 --> 02:16:36,821
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1169
02:16:37,038 --> 02:16:40,821
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1170
02:16:41,041 --> 02:16:45,952
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1171
02:16:46,797 --> 02:16:50,545
Love, Harry. Love.

1172
02:16:58,601 --> 02:17:02,729
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1173
02:17:02,938 --> 02:17:07,600
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1174
02:17:07,859 --> 02:17:11,145
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1175
02:17:11,363 --> 02:17:14,731
But I think I could be safe...

1176
02:17:14,949 --> 02:17:17,322
...with a nice toffee.

1177
02:17:21,414 --> 02:17:22,956
Alas!

1178
02:17:23,666 --> 02:17:25,789
Earwax.

1179
02:17:41,017 --> 02:17:44,184
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1180
02:17:45,312 --> 02:17:48,017
All right. Hermione?

1181
02:17:48,691 --> 02:17:50,518
Never better.

1182
02:18:06,335 --> 02:18:08,789
Another year gone.

1183
02:18:09,546 --> 02:18:14,089
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1184
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:16,922
And the points stand thus:

1185
02:18:17,136 --> 02:18:22,925
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1186
02:18:24,893 --> 02:18:30,563
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1187
02:18:35,863 --> 02:18:37,653
In second place...

1188
02:18:37,864 --> 02:18:42,656
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1189
02:18:48,334 --> 02:18:50,041
And in first place...

1190
02:18:50,377 --> 02:18:55,797
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1191
02:19:01,388 --> 02:19:03,594
Nice one, mate.

1192
02:19:07,435 --> 02:19:11,515
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1193
02:19:11,772 --> 02:19:16,066
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1194
02:19:16,277 --> 02:19:21,235
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1195
02:19:21,866 --> 02:19:27,370
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1196
02:19:27,581 --> 02:19:30,367
...while others were in grave peril...

1197
02:19:31,085 --> 02:19:33,326
...50 points.

1198
02:19:34,253 --> 02:19:35,534
Good job.

1199
02:19:43,262 --> 02:19:49,300
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1200
02:19:49,810 --> 02:19:55,053
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1201
02:19:59,695 --> 02:20:01,735
And third...

1202
02:20:02,281 --> 02:20:05,152
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1203
02:20:05,368 --> 02:20:09,661
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1204
02:20:10,247 --> 02:20:15,123
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1205
02:20:23,426 --> 02:20:25,335
We're tied with Slytherin!

1206
02:20:25,553 --> 02:20:31,556
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1207
02:20:31,768 --> 02:20:35,635
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1208
02:20:35,855 --> 02:20:38,809
I award 10 points...

1209
02:20:39,025 --> 02:20:42,229
...to Neville Longbottom.

1210
02:20:55,584 --> 02:20:58,999
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1211
02:20:59,212 --> 02:21:03,755
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1212
02:21:08,806 --> 02:21:12,174
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1213
02:21:50,220 --> 02:21:53,554
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1214
02:21:53,766 --> 02:21:58,059
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1215
02:22:03,483 --> 02:22:06,768
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1216
02:22:13,033 --> 02:22:16,782
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1217
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,826
This is for you.

1218
02:22:38,602 --> 02:22:40,724
Thanks, Hagrid.

1219
02:22:46,567 --> 02:22:50,980
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1220
02:22:51,405 --> 02:22:55,866
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1221
02:22:56,119 --> 02:22:58,788
...you could always threaten him...

1222
02:22:58,997 --> 02:23:01,867
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1223
02:23:02,084 --> 02:23:07,160
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1224
02:23:07,630 --> 02:23:11,960
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1225
02:23:17,472 --> 02:23:20,592
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1226
02:23:20,809 --> 02:23:22,885
I'm not going home.

1227
02:23:23,103 --> 02:23:25,012
Not really.
