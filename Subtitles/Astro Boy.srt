1
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,423
NARRATOR: Here we are,
floating peacefully in the sky.

2
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,176
Metro City, the jewel in the crown.

3
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,263
Beautiful, isn't it? But how did we get here?

4
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:42,226
A century ago, the founders of Metro City,
seeing our world was changing,

5
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,813
took Mount Sofia and lifted it
out of the Earth and into the sky

6
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:50,401
to be an oasis, a floating paradise.

7
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,155
We don't really know
what happens these days

8
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,366
on the strange and mysterious Surface
we left behind.

9
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:03,289
But life in Metro City is better than ever,
thanks to our friends, the robots.

10
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,417
Robots do our shopping.

11
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:10,630
They cook for us. They serve our meals.

12
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,007
They take good care of us.

13
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,593
They even do the really important things

14
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,721
like reminding us to call Mom
on her birthday.

15
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,308
Whether it's raising our children,
building our buildings,

16
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,145
taking care of our city
or making sure we're all fit and healthy,

17
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,106
for these guys, no job is too big

18
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,527
or too small.

19
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:37,782
Plus, robots do a lot of the things that
frankly we just don't want to do anymore.

20
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,659
Oh, no!

21
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,745
NARRATOR: Don't worry, folks,
that street will get clean.

22
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:46,415
The best and brightest of them get picked
for the more exciting tasks.

23
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,503
This lucky guy is starting the first day
at his new job.

24
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,255
(CRASH)

25
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,969
And it's all thanks to this man, Dr. Tenma,

26
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:01,806
head of the Ministry of Science
and father of modern robotics.

27
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,517
Thanks to him and
the incredible innovations he introduced...

28
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,727
Hey, Toby, isn't that your dad?

29
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,354
- It sure is.
- Hush!

30
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,192
NARRATOR: Our friends, the robots, help us.
Thousands are created every day,

31
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,195
and thousands are disposed of
in the great unending cycle

32
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,240
that sustains life in our great city.

33
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,994
Thanks for everything, guys.
May you rust in peace.

34
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,287
(LAUGHING)

35
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,789
Okay, students. Ready for a pop quiz?

36
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,666
- What?
- SPORTY BOY: Oh, no.

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,876
Begin.

38
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,338
- SPORTY BOY: Oh, man.
- I am so busted.

39
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,549
(ALL GRUMBLING)

40
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,185
Yes, Toby. Is there a problem?

41
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,147
There's no problem.
I'm just finished, and I'd like to leave.

42
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,481
Finished?

43
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,651
For rocket science,
it wasn't exactly rocket science.

44
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,155
I don't suppose there's much point
in you staying.

45
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,908
- Good luck, guys.
- GIRL: Jeez.

46
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,581
Just like his father.

47
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,335
Hello, Master Toby.
Did you have a good day at...

48
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,086
Think fast, Orrin.

49
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:18,007
Thank you, Master Toby.
Very good throw, by the way.

50
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,637
- Hello, Son.
- Hello, sir.

51
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,180
- How was school?
- Oh, great.

52
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,476
Moustachio dropped a pop quiz on us,
but I'm pretty sure I got 100%.

53
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,897
That's good, Son, very good,
but I don't want you to become complacent.

54
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:37,193
It's important to keep studying.
Onward and upward, Toby.

55
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,611
Sure, Dad.

56
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,283
I'm aware I said I'd take you
to that symposium on quantum mechanics,

57
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,661
but I'm afraid
I have to take a rain check again.

58
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,873
- But you promised.
- I'm sorry, Toby, but it's unavoidable.

59
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,876
President Stone has brought forward
the unveiling of the Peacekeeper.

60
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,545
The Peacekeeper?
You've got to be kidding me!

61
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,215
I never kid. Goodbye, Son.

62
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,427
The Peacekeeper, huh?

63
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,431
Hey, Orrin, change of plan.
Take me to the Ministry of Science.

64
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:12,144
I'm sorry, Master Toby, but your father
gave me strict instructions to...

65
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,565
Stop that! What are you doing back there?
Hey! Hey!

66
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,485
Next stop, Ministry of Science.

67
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,155
(HORNS HONKING)

68
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,414
You ready to blow me away today, Tenma?

69
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,166
To make my hair stand up,
to knock my socks off?

70
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:38,421
- Yes, yes, metaphorically speaking.
- STONE: Well, that's the spirit.

71
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,549
Dr. Elefun is an esteemed colleague
of mine, Mr. President.

72
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,594
He may be resistant to having his discovery
used for military purposes.

73
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,555
Well, you leave Dr. Elefun to me.

74
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,223
- TOBY: Dad!
- SOLDIER 1: Hold that kid!

75
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,268
What are you doing here?
I gave Orrin specific instructions to...

76
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,394
(THUMPING)

77
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,229
Ow, ow.

78
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,190
I wanted to see the demonstration.
You're always talking

79
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,109
- about the Peacekeeper and...
- Really, Toby.

80
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,069
- Your boy?
- Yes, sir.

81
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,612
Well, let him tag along.

82
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,905
Releasing potential threat.

83
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,949
It'll be good for him, educational.

84
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,284
Yes, sir.

85
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,747
So, you're interested in robots, son?
Robot weapons?

86
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,333
Absolutely, though I'm sure you'll agree
the latest D-Class Interceptor

87
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,587
underlying deployment-to-target system
is quite old-fashioned.

88
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,921
(SIGHS)

89
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,132
Nobody likes a smarty-pants, kid.

90
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,509
Take this boy to a safe place
and keep him there.

91
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,552
What the...

92
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,471
- Dad!
- I think it's for the best, Toby.

93
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,139
But you said I could see the Peacekeeper.

94
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,143
You still can,
on tonight's news with everybody else.

95
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,353
ELEFUN: Ladies and gentlemen,

96
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,399
allow me to present Blue Core energy.

97
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,069
- Wow.
- ELEFUN: Blue Core energy,

98
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,072
a new self-sustaining power source

99
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,367
much stronger than nuclear energy
and infinitely cleaner.

100
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,870
The raw materials came from space.

101
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:58,375
A fragment of a star millions of light-years
away that no longer even exists.

102
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,170
This is now all that's left of it.

103
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,591
Properly harnessed,
this small sphere could transform

104
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:10,387
not only Metro City,
but life for those on the Surface, as well.

105
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,435
Imagine cleaning up Earth's water.

106
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,604
Imagine bringing back the forests.

107
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,482
Imagine overcoming the effects
of centuries of pollution.

108
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,319
I know he's a bit of a dreamer,
but he's a brilliant scientist.

109
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,697
He's a dangerous idiot
who happens to have a high IQ.

110
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,617
Unfortunately, there's no such thing
as a free lunch.

111
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:35,121
When we extracted the positive blue energy
from the fragment,

112
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:40,167
we were left with this highly unstable
by-product, negative red energy.

113
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,377
STONE: I like that one.

114
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,463
Women voters are partial
to the color red, you know.

115
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,925
Until we discover how to
safely dispose of it... What...

116
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,677
What are you doing? Stop!

117
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:54,056
- Keep the cores apart or you'll kill us all!
- Do as he says.

118
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,811
This is outrageous!
What are you intending to do with it?

119
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,897
(CHUCKLES) I'm gonna give
the people of this city

120
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,150
- a reason to re-elect me.
- How?

121
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:08,028
The only way you can, Doctor.
I'm gonna kick some butt.

122
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,910
- This is so unfair.
- Now cool off, hotshot.

123
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,662
Please don't leave me in here, sir!

124
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,123
I can't stand small places.
Anywhere but here!

125
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,460
Jeez, kid. You're like 13 years old.
It's time you grew a backbone.

126
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,965
Thanks for the life lesson,
and thank you for this.

127
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,718
ELEFUN: As one friend to another,
don't do this, Tenma.

128
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,346
Come on, Elefun. You know as well as I do,
without military funding

129
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,058
all of our research, including yours,
would grind to a halt.

130
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,768
Start it up.

131
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,872
I told President Stone,
"You gotta bring out the big guns."

132
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,498
"Onward and upward, Toby."

133
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,500
Load the Blue Core.

134
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,763
Hold on. This Blue Core,
it's all sweetness and light, right?

135
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,557
I mean, "Save the dolphins,"
"Give peace a chance," and so forth?

136
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,976
It's pure positive energy.

137
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:26,148
Call me a dreamer, but I think we'll get a bit
more bang for our buck using the red one.

138
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,483
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

139
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,817
Oh, you're not joking.

140
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,781
Sir, we're not putting something that
dangerous into something that dangerous.

141
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,742
Listen, Tenma, I've got an election to win.

142
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,954
I need my robot to be a fighter, not a lover.

143
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,665
- Load the red one.
- I won't.

144
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,251
Well, then I'll do it. Move over, sweetheart.

145
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,585
- Hey!
- No!

146
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,798
It's like a video game.

147
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,015
Core loaded.

148
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,850
Piece of cake.

149
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,852
HECKLER: Activate weapon drones.

150
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,361
DRONE: I hate this job.

151
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,282
(EXCLAIMS)

152
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,950
I gotta get a better look.

153
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,786
SOLDIER 1: Time to check the classifieds.
SOLDIER 2: I hear you.

154
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,713

This is so cool. I gotta show Dad.

338
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,036
How can my approval ratings be this low?

339
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:06,833
I was very popular in high school. I've cut
taxes for a lot of very influential friends.

340
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,459
What more do people want?

341
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,879
We're tracking an unidentified object
flying over Metro City, sir.

00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,840
The Surface dwellers are firing at us?

This is what I've been waiting for!
Declare war on them!

344
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,469
This is going to get me re-elected.

345
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,263
This didn't come from the Surface, sir.

346
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,473
It's my opponent. He's taken the gloves off.

347
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:23,641
He's playing hardball.

348
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,059
It's Blue Core energy, sir!

349
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,563
What? Elefun told me the Blue Core
was destroyed.

350
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:32,400
Get me a location and mobilize all units!
I want that thing now!

351
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,362
ELEFUN: I got here as fast as I could.

352
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,656
Where is he? Where's Toby?

353
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:42,327
TENMA: I sent him to his room. Please,
just deactivate him and take him away.

354
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,663
I can't bear to see his face again.

(GASPS)

356
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,625
Come on, Tenma. You can't just
throw him away like a piece ofjunk.

357
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,793
Dad?

358
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,088
What's going on?

359
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,007
Why are you talking about me like this?

360
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,885
Toby, there's been a bit
of a misunderstanding.

361
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:03,014
You're not actually
an entirely ordinary boy.

362

(STUTTERING) I know.

363
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,936
Dad, I can fly. I can drill my way
through solid rock. It's amazing.

364
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,773
How did I think this could work?

365
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:15,818
What's wrong with me?
Why don't you love me anymore?

366
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,613
He's programmed with the memories
of your own son, Tenma.

367
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,699
- Programmed?
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?

Dad.

371
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:32,210
(STUTTERING) I'm not your dad.
You're not Toby.

372
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,212
You're a copy of Toby.

373
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,131
Not my son, a robot,

374
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,596
and I don't want you anymore.

375

No! No!

376
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:47,975
Toby, wait!

377
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:52,230
I can't see into the future,
but I'm sure there's a place for you.

378
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,564
You just have to find it.

379
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:57,902
He's my father. This is my home.
It's all I know.

Everyone has their destiny, Toby.

Didn't you hear him? I'm not Toby.

the signal's source, but it's a child.

Readings for the Core are off the chart!

Is that Tenma's boy?

389
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:50,997
Of course not! Holy cow.
Tenma must've lost his mind.

Bring it in.

Dad? Cora? What happened?

01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,621
- Is the Peacekeeper gone?
- Yes.

Thank you, Zog.

Astro, I think you've finally found
your place in the world.

You're a hero,

Yeah, it was nothing.

Well, when you think about it, Sparxy,
it really was nothing.

I don't want you to call me
"sir" anymore, Orrin.

In fact, take the day off. Go on and enjoy
yourself with the robot ladies and so forth.
