2
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,922
Watch your speed, Diaz.
We don't need the cops pulling you over.

3
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,361
- How far's the turnoff?
- Couple of miles.

4
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,364
Puts you right on the interstate
out of Gotham.

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,282
What was that?

6
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,806
It's Batman, ain't it?

7
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,088
Jeez Louise, it's a woman!

8
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,721
What are you sitting there for?

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,047
Get out!

10
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,170
Whoa, who's having the light show?

11
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,564
Ah!

12
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,485
Haven't seen her around the cave.

13
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,810
Could she have been an old opponent
in a new disguise? Perhaps Catwoman.

14
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,681
No, even Selina Kyle has
more regard for human life.

15
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,808
This is someone entirely new, Alfred.

16
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,930
The last thing Gotham needs
is a vigilante running amuck.

17
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,970
As they say on the streets,
"I ain't touching that one."

18
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,203
The point is, her costume links her
to me. Why?

19
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,880
What does she have planned?
How far will she go?

20
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,886
Do be careful. Remember, there are
many species in which the female...

21
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,929
is deadlier than the male.

22
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,922
He's been waiting.

23
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,571
It still lists to the right.
See what you can do.

24
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,245
Penguin.

25
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,200
Mr. Duquesne. I hear we had
an unpropitious setback.

26
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,681
If you mean we got hit, yeah.

27
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,889
And how exactly could that
have happened?

28
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,127
I don't know yet.

29
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,284
No one but us even knew the shipment
was going out last night.

30
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,727
Well, someone did.

31
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,802
- A Batwoman?
- That's what my man said, Thorne.

32
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,807
Batman, Batgirl, Batwoman!
What is it about this city? The water?

33
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,322
Fortunately, it was only one truckload.

34
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,091
I've doubled the manpower
at our warehouse sites.

35
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,368
No way she can get to the rest.

36
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,286
Forgive me if I'm not so sanguine.

37
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,411
Our overseas consortium has paid us
a half-billion dollars for these arms.

38
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,451
If we don't deliver, they'll want their
money back. Since we've spent it...

39
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,490
that would present a problem,
wouldn't it?

40
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,291
I want the rest of it to be out
within the week...

41
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,046
which means take care
of this bat-clone now.

42
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,525
You're supposed to be our muscle,
Mr. Duquesne. Start flexing.

43
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,566
Well, someone talked!
Someone dropped a dime!

44
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,485
- We find out who, we'll find her.
- Daddy!

45
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,640
Hold on.

46
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,807
- Where you been?
- Don't worry, Daddy.

47
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,846
I brought your lapdogs with me.
For once, they came in handy.

48
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,604
Shoo.

49
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,521
So Raoul, my favorite hairdresser,
had a spiritual rebirth last week...

50
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,087
and left for an ashram in Bukittinggi.

51
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,971
- How was your day?
- You should tell me when you go out.

52
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,010
Uh-huh. Who's on the phone?

53
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,084
Business. Nothing for you
to worry about.

54
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,130
I guess I should be going then.

55
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,281
We're getting dangerously close
to a conversation.

56
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,528
Do whatever it takes. I want you
to find her. Find her and finish her!

57
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,890
<i>Today on Bat-Watch, everyone wonders
who the mysterious Batwoman could be.</i>

58
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,090
<i>Batman's new partner? Batgirl grown up?
We asked Police Commissioner Gordon.</i>

59
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,526
<i>Commissioner...</i>

60
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,769
<i>All I can say is,
she's not affiliated with Batman.</i>

61
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,208
<i>Otherwise, I have no comment.</i>

62
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,203
<i>Det. Bullock! Harvey!</i>

63
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,204
<i>I think we got enough bat-freaks
in Gotham already.</i>

64
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,404
<i>I mean, what's next? Bat-hound?</i>

65
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,962
<i>Come on, Bullock, throw us
a bone here, will you?</i>

66
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,243
I've been thinking about getting a dog.
He could help us sniff out clues.

67
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,082
- Bruce Wayne.
- Bruce, <i>it's</i> Barbara.

68
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,401
Hey, Barb.

69
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,291
- She misses you.
- How's college?

70
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,125
Not bad, though the nightlife here
can't compare...

71
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,930
with kicking butt as Batgirl.

72
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,969
But spring break'll be
coming up soon...

73
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,010
and I'll be back in Gotham
for two whole weeks.

74
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,400
Won't that be nice?

75
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,767
Yes, we'll all be happy to see you.

76
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,251
Don't drag me into this.

77
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,488
Anyway, that's not the reason I called.

78
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,008
I just saw the news and was wondering
if you got a new partner.

79
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,640
Someone a little older?

80
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,450
I have no idea who she is.

81
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,921
Because if you had,
I'd be really upset...

82
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,323
because I thought you and I were,
you know...

83
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,963
Barb, we're going through
the East Tunnel now.

84
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,966
Afraid signal's breaking up.
Talk later.

85
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,369
Squeaked through again, didn't you?

86
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,490
I never fail to marvel
at your narrow escapes, sir.

87
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,524
One female bat at a time.

88
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,204
In discussing this new alloy,
I brought some charts...

89
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,803
to demonstrate the care and precision
we bring to our work at Wayne Tech.

90
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,485
So as you can see, the alloy's tensile
malleability is remarkably high...

91
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,405
given its density
and homeotropic structure.

92
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,327
Meaning that the flexible
molecular stacking will...

93
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,088
provide considerable morphological
adaptability...

94
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,006
through the electromagnetic
manipulation of the quantum states!

95
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,130
Hmm.

96
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,608
See this chunk of metal?
I can program it to change shape.

97
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,601
- Oh, fantastic.
- That's fantastic.

98
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,283
- Oh!
- Wow.

99
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,966
I thought she said it was metal.

100
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,611
- Look at that.
- It's beautiful.

101
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,967
Just with one touch?

102
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,365
So exciting.

103
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,567
Actually, the technology's pretty simple.

104
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,610
It's just imprinting morph lines
with a pressure point.

105
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,560
- I'm not sure what it's good for.
- I happen to have a silent partner...

106
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,838
who I'm sure will
find some use for it.

107
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:10,749
That's great.

108
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,408
It's so cool to be in an R&D company
that takes young women seriously...

109
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,050
especially blonds.

110
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,921
At Wayne Tech, it's what's under
the hair that counts, Dr. Ballantine.

111
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,003
It's Rocky. Actually, Roxanne...

112
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,484
but people have always called me
Rocky for some reason.

113
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,243
Look! It's the bat signal!

114
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,323
- Where?
- Right there!

115
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,926
What's going on over there?

116
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,527
Wow! I've never seen it before!
Isn't it exciting?

117
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,286
Every time. Check.

118
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,721
He'll get here. And remember,
when he does, I'll do the talking.

119
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,085
What is it?

120
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,608
I had Bullock collect the remains
of the contraband destroyed.

121
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,610
I thought you might like to take a look.

122
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,124
Stuffs out of Star Trek. I thought
maybe someone broke into a toy store.

123
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,124
These aren't toys, Bullock.
This is a plasma rifle.

124
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,487
It could take out a tank at 200 yards.

125
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,769
More like 500.
I measured the clip size.

126
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,491
Sonia Alcana, Bullock's new partner.

127
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,929
There are also EK4 lasers and a barrel
from a surface-to-air missile launcher.

128
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,890
- Who's behind this?
- The truck driver ain't talking...

129
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,368
but I got some leads. Can't say
anything definite right now.

130
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,806
We have nothing.

131
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,047
Hey!

132
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,646
- Where'd you get this?
- From the guy's truck...

133
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,087
when I had it impounded.

134
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,488
I'll get back to you.

135
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,406
What's got his tights in a twist?

136
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,090
Penguin owns this place?

137
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,925
Along with Duquesne and Thorne.

138
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,448
- What do they make here?
- Trinkets, figurines...

139
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,764
weapons of mass destruction.
I don't see any of his goons around.

140
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,802
There she is!

141
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,210
See her?

142
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,122
Over there!

143
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,166
So you like to play rough, huh, sweetie?
Ow!

144
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,962
Welcome to superhero team-up!

145
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,451
Get them!

146
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,763
Come on!

147
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,925
Ah!

148
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,244
- You shouldn't be here.
- Likewise.

149
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,368
No. I mean, I've set a charge.

150
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,363
Where?

151
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,762
Below us.

152
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,123
A munitions room.

153
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,771
Let's get out of here!

154
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,971
Where'd she go?

155
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,970
Up there!

156
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,883
Let's move!

157
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,324
They were making arms for Kasnia...

158
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,971
something the State Department would
frown upon. This was their weapons plant.

159
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,962
It'd be a little hard to prove that now.

160
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,481
Doesn't matter. They were finished here.

161
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,007
But I've just begun.

162
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,602
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

163
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,684
You're the great detective. Figure it out.

164
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,202
Gotta jet.

165
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,402
Who? The Batwoman?

166
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,525
What do you mean it's gone?
The whole building?

167
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,569
You got a lot of nerve, freak!

168
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,042
You and your woman have caused me
enough grief for one night.

169
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,969
It's my home, my family! Get out!

170
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,966
I heard a commotion last night.
Who was here?

171
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,368
Nobody.

172
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,485
Did nobody do that too?

173
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,406
Nothing for you to worry about.

174
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,245
As if I ever.

175
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,482
- Where you going?
- Nowhere.

176
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,811
Do they have to come?

177
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,809
Just for the next couple days.

178
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,130
I'm having trouble with some people.
I don't want you to have any problems.

179
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,847
You mean like Mama problems?

180
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,607
You live under my roof in my town.
You do what I say!

181
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,841
Hmm.

182
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,084
Fetch.

183
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,161
That's her.

184
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,366
Exactly what is it you hope
to discover?

185
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,205
What a beautiful young woman does
in her free time.

186
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,283
A pleasure drive then.

187
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,682
I see why Dennis the Menace
is one step closer to juvenile hall.

188
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,044
- How many stores does this make?
- Including the nail boutique, seven.

189
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,283
And not one sale on explosives.

190
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,408
You know, Alfred, I think I could use
a new watch.

191
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,807
You deserve it, sir.

192
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,405
Brown taffeta? What are they thinking?

193
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,246
It's a dressing room! The worst that
can happen is, I'll need a size 8!

194
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,722
Why don't you go rob gift wrap
or something?

195
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,651
I miss working for The Joker.

196
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,162
- Sir, could you help me?
- Sorry, I don't work here.

197
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,451
No, not that. See those men?
I'd rather they not see me.

198
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,843
If you could just help me get
to the escalator...

199
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,051
Okay. Usually, you only see things
like this in the movies.

200
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,605
Hey, wait! Miss Duquesne!

201
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,603
Who's she with?

202
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,889
Hey!

203
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,489
Keep going.

204
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,769
Oh, dear.

205
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,163
You're good.

206
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,641
Here they come.

207
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,409
Hurry, get in. Unless you want
that lovely face rearranged.

208
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,489
- Hey, stop!
- You crazy?

209
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,162
- Who were they?
- Daddy's bodyguards.

210
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,366
You've just run off
with a very notorious woman.

211
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,364
I'm Kathy Duquesne,
daughter of Carlton Duquesne.

212
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,966
The gangster?

213
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,846
Yes, but we try not to use
the G word in front of Daddy.

214
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,884
This is interesting.
I think we're being followed.

215
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,967
Doesn't look like Daddy's goon squad.
Hope you're not expected anywhere.

216
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,721
You're on your own, Master Bruce.

217
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,529
We having fun yet?

218
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,527
Bruce Wayne?

219
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,240
What a photo op!

220
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,246
The most respected man in Gotham with
the daughter of the most disrespected.

221
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,125
Your father has a lot of competition
for that title.

222
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,120
I know. Most of them come to dinner
from time to time.

223
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,967
I used to wonder what it's like to come
from a respectable family...

224
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,165
where there's no violence,
no vendettas, no victims.

225
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,288
What must that feel like?

226
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,091
I wish I could tell you.

227
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,844
It must feel like freedom.

228
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,964
Kathy, be careful.

229
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,206
You sound like my mama. "Be careful,
Kathy. Don't go scaring me, girl."

230
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,648
This was our favorite spot.
We used to come out here to paint.

231
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,043
She was a great artist.
She said I had the eye.

232
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,569
She said, "Honey, you could be
another Carrie Mae Weems."

233
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,886
What happened?

234
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,884
She died. Isn't that
what always happens?

235
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,565
I'm sorry.

236
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,643
Everyone's sorry.

237
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,564
It doesn't make any difference.

238
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,131
Here. Bring it back sometime.
Or not. There's always plenty more.

239
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,127
Down, boys.

240
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,287
I met Batwoman.

241
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,728
She confirmed they were making
the weapons at Penguin's factory.

242
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,565
- Who is she?
- I think Carlton Duquesne's daughter.

243
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,564
Remember the assassination attempt
on him 10 years ago?

244
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,042
Yeah, they missed him.
Hit his wife instead.

245
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,727
I think Kathy Duquesne blames her father
for that and a lot more.

246
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,446
Come on, she'd be biting
the hand that feeds her.

247
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,762
Think of the dough her old man has.

248
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,082
You can't buy peace of mind, Bullock.

249
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,129
Let's keep a tail on her.

250
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,843
I see Miss Duquesne is gifted...

251
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,844
in other sports
besides extreme shopping.

252
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,322
This bodes well for your suspicions,
does it not, Master Bruce?

253
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,369
Yes, Alfred.

254
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,887
What's with him?

255
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,527
I think he has some affection
for this one.

256
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,446
He sure can pick them.

257
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,566
Relax. We were gonna torch
the place for the money anyway.

258
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,169
I don't think you appreciate
the precariousness of our perch...

259
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,125
especially now
that we have no factory!

260
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,961
If we're unable to deliver the rest
of our stockpile, we're dead.

261
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,811
The Kasnians will come after us
like wolverines.

262
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,485
We'll be begging for prison.

263
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,211
Duquesne says he can handle
the bat-broad.

264
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,489
She almost killed Batman,
for heaven's sake!

265
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,927
Normally, I would find
that commendable...

266
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,323
but now it just proves
that Duquesne is out of his league.

267
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,370
We need some real muscle.

268
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,611
Ah!

269
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,362
Whoever you want to bring in,
Penguin, is fine with me.

270
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,247
I can't believe this!

271
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,560
Who are they getting?
Who's better than you?

272
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,722
Penguin's not saying.

273
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,887
Get out. Get out!

274
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,846
Click on the red crystal, then
the blue, then hold down the shift key.

275
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,086
Whoa! You got in!

276
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,928
I've raided a few tombs in my time.

277
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,767
She found the secret bonus level
to "Death Castle 3000"!

278
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,083
Nobody at school can figure it out.
The guys are gonna flip.

279
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,087
So is Alfred. He's been waiting
in the car for you all this time.

280
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,284
Oh. Thanks.

281
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,889
- Working late again?
- Yeah.

282
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,886
Fortunately, my boyfriend is
very understanding. What about yours?

283
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,324
Girlfriend! I mean, of course girlfriend.
After all, considering your reputation.

284
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,246
Not that it's bad or anything or any
of my business, because it's not.

285
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,971
I was just curious.
How red is my face?

286
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,171
Crimson. And no, I don't
have anybody special.

287
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,324
Am I that forgettable, Bruce?

288
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,007
I've managed to lose my shadows
for a while...

289
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,367
and I thought I'd paint the town red.

290
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,763
Want to come along
and empty a few spray cans?

291
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,803
Excuse me, Kathy Duquesne,
Roxanne Ballantine.

292
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,930
- Pleased to meet you.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

293
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,044
- About what?
- I don't know.

294
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,006
- So you never got married, huh?
- Uh-uh.

295
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,209
Hard to believe. Here she comes.

296
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,524
Well, what do you know?
It's the trash picking up the trash.

297
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,204
<i>Don't tell me that you don't like
Anything about me</i>

298
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,762
<i>I see it in your eyes That look</i>

299
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,645
<i>You think that I don't notice</i>

300
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,168
<i>Don't hide what you feel inside</i>

301
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,081
<i>Maybe I can feel the same</i>

302
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,607
<i>What you do, it's up to you</i>

303
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,282
<i>So maybe you should try again</i>

304
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,723
<i>Maybe you just fade</i> away

305
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,247
<i>Bet you never, bet you never
Bet you never thought we'd get this far</i>

306
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,050
Hey, K.D.

307
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,407
Looking hot.

308
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,084
You got some fries with that shake?

309
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,490
I know, not exactly
the book-club crowd.

310
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,967
I suppose you know
who owns this place.

311
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,011
She should.
I bought her her first parasol.

312
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,650
- Kathleen.
- Ozzie.

313
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,088
And Mr. Wayne.
It's been quite a while, hasn't it?

314
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,720
Yes. The last time was when
you stole plutonium...

315
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,531
from one of my labs
and threatened to blow up the city.

316
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,170
Oh, yes, my more
rambunctious days.

317
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,445
Sir, your call just came in.

318
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,605
The vagaries of a restaurateur.
You understand.

319
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,648
Didn't know you and Penguin
had issues.

320
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,610
It's not the bird
that's bothering me, it's you.

321
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,121
- What kind of game are you playing?
- Game?

322
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,443
You dump your guards for a night,
and where do you go?

323
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,285
A club where the patrons
are your father's cronies.

324
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,125
It's like you want him to hear about it.

325
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,009
I'm not sure I like your tone.

326
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,084
I think I'll decide in the powder room.
Twa-la.

327
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,970
So you've already landed. Splendid.
How soon before we can commiserate?

328
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,325
I can drop by your club tonight.
I assume you have a back entrance.

329
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,963
Oh, yes. I use it so much, I'm thinking
of installing a revolving door.

330
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,929
See you then.

331
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,329
- I said I wasn't to be disturbed.
- Oh, am I disturbing you?

332
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,847
Can't have that, can we?

333
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,643
How dare you? Release me at once,
you harridan, or I'll...

334
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,881
They're constricting.

335
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,407
They'll slice a penguin like a turkey...

336
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,245
unless you tell me
who your new player is.

337
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,842
Who, Penguin?
Who's the big, bad boogeyman?

338
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,807
I can't hear you.

339
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,440
- Bane.
- Bane?!

340
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,966
No, run this way.

341
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,606
Huh?

342
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,286
A bat-seeking missile for you, my dear.

343
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,883
You hear that?

344
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,766
Call for backup!

345
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,164
I don't know!

346
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,806
Time to burn a bat. Ah!

347
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,726
Come on, let's see those
pointy little ears.

348
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,690
- Stay together.
- Hurry!

349
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,042
It must've been a heck of a floorshow.

350
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,245
I have to admit, not every date
I have ends with a police investigation.

351
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,411
You poor thing. Every time we're
together I seem to risk your life.

352
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,723
I'm sorry about tonight.
You were right about me.

353
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,565
No, no, don't say that.
I jumped to conclusions.

354
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,890
I was wrong about you. And tonight...
Tonight turned out wonderfully.

355
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,209
The old man wants you.

356
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,048
I'd invite you in, but I think
it's going to be chilly upstairs.

357
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,042
Souvenir?

358
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,244
I found it in the Penguin's club.

359
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,047
How about an autograph?
Make it a real collector's item.

360
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,929
- What did you learn at the lounge?
- Other than the fact...

361
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,442
that Kathy Duquesne
can't be Batwoman, not much.

362
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,162
I found this in his office. I think
Batwoman used it on him. I kept a piece.

363
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,369
You know removing evidence
from the scene of a crime is...

364
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,161
probably not gonna lose you
any sleep.

365
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,163
Call it a souvenir.

366
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,002
You saved my life once.

367
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,810
Nine years ago. Arsonists,
they burned my parents' shop.

368
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,123
I was sleeping.
We lived on the second floor.

369
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,568
My room was filled with smoke.
I couldn't find the window.

370
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,803
The floor was hot, flames shooting
between the floorboards.

371
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,641
And then, there you were.

372
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,168
I remember. The arsonists
were working for Rupert Thorne.

373
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,802
Part of his protection racket.
The DA couldn't make the case stick.

374
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,289
Yeah, that's why I decided
to become a cop.

375
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,329
I just thought you should know.

376
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,889
That's tight. What's it mean?

377
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,526
The wire from Penguin's office
is identical...

378
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,251
to the alloy Dr. Ballantine developed.

379
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,081
Rocky? You think someone's
using her stuff?

380
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,844
Arms up.

381
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,329
Proceed.

382
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,763
- Kevin, are you okay?
- No, Rocky, I'm not okay.

383
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,321
I'm so far from okay,
I can't even see it.

384
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,205
Don't give up. We're close.
Really close.

385
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,449
Once someone in Penguin's
organization is willing to talk...

386
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,251
You can't keep doing this.
It's too dangerous.

387
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,689
- If Penguin finds out you're spying...
- He won't. I can take care of myself.

388
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,731
I'm not the wimp I used to be.
I've changed. I've had to.

389
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,611
You'd have to be Supergirl
to stand a chance.

390
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,967
You don't know what I've been doing.

391
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,683
Look, Rocky, I don't want
to see you anymore.

392
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,930
- You aren't...
- Serious? I'm dead serious.

393
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,243
I've got five more years here
before I get a shot at parole.

394
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,131
It's stupid to waste your life
waiting for me.

395
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,886
It's my life. I can waste it
any way I want.

396
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,610
Don't come here again, Rocky.

397
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,650
- If you do, I won't see you.
- Kevin?

398
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,804
Kevin, no! Listen to me.

399
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,803
Kevin!

400
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,681
You have no new messages.

401
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,289
- Batman?
- Nice moves for a computer geek.

402
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,006
I used to... I mean...
Well, so what?

403
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,004
I took self-defense classes,
like millions of women.

404
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,970
Now it's your turn.
Why are you in my apartment?

405
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,963
Checking out your new designs.

406
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,481
They're beyond what you're doing
for Wayne.

407
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,645
- You were...? You had no right to...
- Where were you last night?

408
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,805
- I was at Wayne Tech.
- You left by 7:00.

409
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,324
- Well, I went for a walk.
- To the Iceberg Lounge?

410
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,484
Wait a minute, are you trying
to say I'm Batwoman?

411
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,801
You're not serious.

412
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,850
Recognize this? Batwoman used it.

413
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,641
It has the same configuration as the alloy
you developed for Wayne Tech.

414
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,168
So? I'm hardly the only one
working in metallurgy.

415
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,006
True, but you're the right body type.
And you have a motive.

416
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,004
Your fiancé was framed
for smuggling by the Penguin.

417
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,845
And I know someone
broke into the Penguin's files.

418
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,164
Yeah? So what? Of course I'm trying
to get Kevin's sentence commuted...

419
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,608
but I'm not doing anything illegal.
Here's a radical notion:

420
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,650
Instead of me, how about you
investigate the birdman?

421
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,169
I bet there's lots more
incriminating evidence on his hard drives.

422
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,607
This game you're playing has
high stakes, higher than you know.

423
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,531
You could get hurt or worse.

424
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,366
You sound just like him.

425
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,008
I checked the warehouses
this morning.

426
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,403
- No reports of any trouble.
- Yet.

427
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,690
There's our cheerful associate.

428
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,643
Shall we meet and greet, gentlemen?

429
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,160
Penguin, I have reviewed your proposal
for my employment.

430
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,364
I'm sorry, but your terms
are not acceptable.

431
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,161
I want carte blanche,
complete control of the operation.

432
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,606
I answer to no one.

433
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,764
Now wait, you can't just
roll in here and give orders.

434
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,288
I just did, <i>Senior</i> Duquesne.

435
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:48,281
Do not worry. If this Batwoman
attempts any interference at all...

436
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,966
He has a way with words.
Now, shall we discuss the shipment?

437
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,481
This time we have spared no expense.

438
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,761
We're using a luxury cruise liner
as our cover, and the ship sails tonight.

439
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,490
- What's the matter?
- The night you and I saw Batwoman...

440
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,371
Rocky Ballantine was working
late at Wayne Tech.

441
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,490
I knew she couldn't be Batwoman.
She's too nice.

442
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,490
I was so sure this time.

443
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,881
Well, she can't be
in two places at once...

444
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,362
unless she has the power
to duplicate herself.

445
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,770
Robin, get on the computer.

446
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,369
Cross-reference all databases on
Kathy Duquesne and Roxanne Ballantine.

447
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,564
Find anything that connects them.
Anything.

448
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,167
- Where are you going?
- To make a house call.

449
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,321
Their plans, the
timetable, the manpower, Bane's agenda...

450
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,891
- He's onto me.
- What?

451
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,727
Batman, he knows everything about me:

452
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,329
Where I work, what I do,
all about Kevin. It's uncanny.

453
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,730
- So what?
- So what? He's gonna ruin everything!

454
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,930
I told you we should've created
a new identity, not just spun it off him.

455
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:31,246
She's right, look at how fast he caught
onto me. We didn't count on this.

456
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,768
So he thinks you're Batwoman.
Two days ago he thought it was you.

457
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,922
Tomorrow he'll think
it's someone else.

458
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:42,081
Trust me, if he really had any idea
what's going on, I would know.

459
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,121
We are so close to our goal. We stop
them tonight, and we've broken them.

460
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,408
- Tonight?
- They're moving that fast?

461
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:54,930
Not fast enough for us, Rocky.
Never fast enough for us.

462
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,808
Somebody in here?

463
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,807
- Something wrong?
- Nope.

464
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,642
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- I got some bad news for you.</i>

465
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,606
Or maybe good. There's no connection
between Kathy and Rocky.

466
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,967
Different cities, circles and planets.

467
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,767
<i>No way they could've
known each other.</i>

468
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,088
Yes, there is.

469
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,210
All they needed was someone
to introduce them.

470
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,521
Remember, once they load the ship...

471
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,524
Bane will station himself
in the pilot's cabin...

472
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,763
with guards at checkpoints.
You get past this one...

473
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,651
and it's straight to the atrium
and the weapons.

474
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,529
And the gift boutiques.

475
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,763
Kathy, the detonator
has a fail safe countdown.

476
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,247
I wouldn't shop too long.

477
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,688
I guess this is it.

478
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,007
You sure you're gonna be all right?

479
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,243
Don't worry, I'll be back.

480
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,289
<i>Seniorita.</i>

481
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,491
Would you stop that infernal tapping?
In a few minutes the ship will be...

482
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,884
in international waters,
and we'll be very rich men.

483
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,161
Gin.

484
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,527
Yes. Yes, he's here. We're all here.

485
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,489
She did?

486
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,811
No. You want us now?

487
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,849
- Is the shipment...?
- It's fine...

488
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,166
but he's not leaving the harbor yet.
He has Batwoman.

489
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,168
Mustn't keep the lady waiting.

490
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,408
- Batman?
- You knew Kathy Duquesne.

491
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,961
- What?
- You both took art classes together.

492
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,050
She sketched your face.
It was years ago, but it's you.

493
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,884
Kathy had a good eye.

494
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,246
- You also knew Rocky Ballantine.
- Who?

495
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,007
Let me jog your memory.
State University, freshman year.

496
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,403
Same dorm, same floor, same room.

497
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,525
You've been a busy bat.

498
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,769
You each brought something
to the party. Kathy had money...

499
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:52,165
Rocky had the genius and you had the
scheme and the will to make it happen.

500
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,805
When that fire destroyed my folks'
business, they never recovered.

501
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,010
They'd worked their whole lives,
and then it was ashes, just like that.

502
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,282
It tore our family apart.

503
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,445
Everyone knew it was Rupert Thorne,
but there was no way to prove it.

504
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,049
Now he's gonna know how it feels
to see his life go up in smoke.

505
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,206
Three Batwomen.

506
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,410
It was just a matter of disguising
your voices and taking turns.

507
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,249
And you know what? It almost worked.

508
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,650
Where is Kathy Duquesne?

509
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,887
- I'm here.
- Something's definitely wrong.

510
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,520
There's no report
of any ship in distress.

511
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,808
I radioed Kathy,
but she's not responding.

512
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,610
She's in trouble, I can feel it.

513
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,921
What're we gonna do?

514
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,843
<i>Sonia?</i>

515
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,811
Olé, senior. Exemplary work.

516
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,688
I wanted you here
when I realized who she was.

517
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,446
I felt a certain caution was in order.

518
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,648
So who is she?

519
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,963
- Kathy?
- What's going on, Duquesne?

520
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:50,330
- No wonder she always knew our plans.
- What? You think I told her?

521
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,642
She planned to use this.

522
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,691
Don't let the size fool you, <i>seniores,</i>
it's a carbonite bomb.

523
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,286
It can take out this
entire chamber and more.

524
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,006
Are you crazy?
How could you do this to me?!

525
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,404
It was easy, Daddy. You made it easy,
because of the kind of man you are.

526
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,007
A man whose wife is killed
just because she stands next to him.

527
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,249
The kind of man who makes a prison
out of his own house...

528
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,289
a prisoner out of his own child.

529
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,603
The kind of man who spreads misery
to everything he touches.

530
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:22,207
- And for what? For them?!
- Shut up!

531
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,689
- This doesn't make sense!
- On that we agree...

532
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,123
because I distinctly remember
your daughter at my lounge...

533
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,362
the same night Batwoman
assaulted me.

534
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,571
You're not in this alone,
are you, Kathleen?

535
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,207
Who else?

536
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,488
Penguin, no!

537
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,721
No, don't!

538
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,568
Tell me who else is involved
while Daddy still has a neck.

539
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,166
Ah!

540
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,249
- Ah!
- Ouch!

541
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,805
Bon voyage, Senior Batman.

542
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,921
Bridge, head out to sea.
I want us in international waters now.

543
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,289
Whoa!

544
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,970
- They're heading to sea. What you think?
- Batman said he'd give a signal...

545
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,164
but that doesn't mean
we can't take a closer look.

546
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,045
You're out, Duquesne.

547
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,601
I shouldn't have got mixed up
with you.

548
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,410
That'll give you and your brat...

549
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,927
something to talk about
in family therapy. Huh?

550
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,004
Where's the bomb? Wasn't it here?

551
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,648
It's not over yet, amigo.

552
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,246
- Here.
- I could've gotten out of them.

553
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,641
No doubt, since you
got yourself into them.

554
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,566
Your friends are waiting to rescue you.
Let's not disappoint them.

555
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,201
No, let's not.

556
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,764
Don't! Break the magnets,
and it'll go off.

557
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,241
There's no way to stop it
without the code...

558
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,051
which escapes me at the moment.

559
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,651
I'm sorry, but one way
or another it has to end.

560
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,408
Even if she doesn't have the bomb, let's
act like cautious birds and head south.

561
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,407
Well, what do you know?
Our two favorite felons.

562
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,688
Egads, they're multiplying.

563
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,847
That felt so good.
Now where's Kathy Duquesne?

564
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,285
Daddy!

565
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:31,130
I knew sooner or later we would
face each other, Batman. I prayed for it.

566
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,726
This ship is going down
in less than a minute.

567
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,969
That's all the time I need.

568
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,449
Should've saved those prayers.

569
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,924
- Abandon ship?
- You think?

570
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,802
Let's go. Double-time it.
Come on now.

571
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,850
- Would you move it?
- I wanna get out of here.

572
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,843
Let's get going. Get out of here!

573
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,888
Come on, lower, lower, lower.

574
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,646
Sonia!

575
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,131
- I got her.
- Don't worry about me.

576
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,402
Just get them!

577
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,722
The ship's going down, Penguin.

578
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,283
Our only consolation is that
it will take a few bats with it.

579
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,804
- What?
- Huh?

580
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,051
And I thought penguins liked the water.

581
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:39,211
<i>Estupido! No bonds can hold me!</i>

582
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,645
What?

583
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,809
No!

584
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,244
I can still crush you!

585
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,685
No!

586
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,564
No!

587
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,405
Sonia?

588
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,609
I've got you.

589
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,606
Maybe I should write the report
this time, huh, Bullock?

590
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,648
For what it's worth,
the city's losing a good cop.

591
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,808
Condoning vigilantes is one thing...

592
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,930
but even Com. Gordon
draws the line at employing them.

593
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,686
We're just lucky the DA's
looking the other way.

594
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,207
Someday you'll have to tell me
how you do it.

595
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,601
How you keep from crossing the line.

596
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,843
When I put on the mask,
I couldn't even see the line.

597
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,001
- Maybe I don't take it as personally.
- Somehow I doubt that.

598
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,931
- Where will you go?
- I'm not sure.

599
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:07,290
Someplace simpler, where capes
aren't the prevailing fashion.

600
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,329
Don't tell me you came to wish me luck.

601
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,251
That, and to give you this.

602
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:17,281
Exculpatory evidence that should help
release Dr. Ballantine's fiance from jail.

603
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:21,206
- I thought it should come from you.
- I... Thank you.

604
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,522
I'm sure she'll appreciate it.

605
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:31,209
Huh. I think I'm gonna miss that.

606
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:38,564
I hated who he was, what he did,
the hurt he brought to people.

607
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:42,008
But now that he's in here, I feel bad.

608
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:46,370
At least we talk. He's making a deal
to testify against Thorne and Penguin.

609
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,569
Maybe he hated his life
as much as you hated yours.

610
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,929
For a computer geek,
you're pretty smart.

611
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,248
- By the way, how's Bruce?
- Mr. Wayne? Fine, I guess.

612
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,927
- You haven't heard from him?
- I think he's been reading the papers.

613
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,923
Rocky!

614
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,289
Rocky!

615
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,765
Kevin!

616
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,244
Kevin.

617
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,248
Oh, Kevin.

618
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,409
Twa-la.

619
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,640
- About time I returned this.
- What are you doing here?

620
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:44,125
Funny thing. This morning I got up
thinking, "Something's wrong."

621
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:49,081
No gunfire,
no explosions, no goons out to do me in.

622
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,686
Everything was peaceful and quiet.

623
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,811
And that's when I realized
how much I missed you.

624
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,321
You poor thing. But that was
the old Kathy Duquesne.

625
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,726
The new one is different.

626
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,168
She intends to live a life
of complete respectability.

627
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,489
- All the time?
- Afraid so.

628
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:17,042
Well, maybe an explosion now and then.

629
01:11:18,305 --> 01:12:18,753
