2
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,623
- Hello?
- Sonny, it's your dad. You asleep?

3
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,876
No. Hey, man. I was exercising.

4
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,629
- Bullshit. You were sleeping.
- I wasn't.

5
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,258
This kid won't stop lying to me.
You still act like you're 6.

6
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,803
Yeah, okay, Dad.
I act like I'm 6.

7
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,807
Found a job yet where
you work more than one day a week?

8
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,308
I've been looking.

9
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,310
Looking won't pay the rent.

10
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,938
All the money I won
from the cab accident...

11
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,607
...is kicking ass
in the stock market, so relax.

12
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,318
- Don't blow it on worthless crap.
- I won't.

13
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,698
You should spend it
on your bar exam.

14
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,617
You're the lawyer.
I ain't taking a bar exam.

15
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,828
I got too much other shit going on.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,331
I don't know what happened to you.

17
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,668
How're things going with
your girlfriend, Vanessa?

18
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,003
Things are going fine.

19
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,629
Shit!

20
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,839
I gotta go.

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,842
Shit! You turned off
the alarm clock again.

22
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,846
No! I mean, yes, I did,
but I thought you needed more sleep.

23
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,600
I shouldn't have stayed here.
That was a jerk thing to do.

24
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,436
Why are you going to work?
It's Sunday.

25
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,482
I'm not going to work. I'm going to
brunch with potential clients.

26
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:51,319
That's how a party planner
gets business, by making contacts.

27
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,864
Meet with me. I'll order in
from Cozy's. We'll have fun.

28
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,868
I am sick of Cozy's.
You order in from there all the time.

29
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,703
The delivery guy's your best friend.

30
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,039
He happens to be pretty damn nice.

31
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,041
This is a rough patch in my life.

32
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,795
Syracuse is 0 and 3.
And I got those medical problems.

33
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,171
Medical problems?

34
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,008
A cab runs over your foot two years
ago. You're hospitalized one night.

35
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,052
First of all, that cab was huge.

36
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:20,515
And a jury decided that one night
of pain was worth $200,000.

37
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,683
- So there you go.
- Whatever.

38
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,269
Why are you being
so nuts to me lately?

39
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,356
You refuse to move on
to the next phase.

40
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,399
I'd like to have a family someday.

41
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,361
I need someone I can rely on,
not a playmate.

42
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,906
You need a father figure?
"Stop pulling your sister's hair!"

43
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,827
You know what? I'm gonna go to
Syracuse to see my mom.

44
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,831
- I'll be back on Wednesday.
- What are you talking about?

45
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:52,046
I had call for delivery, but it was
crank call. You want chocolate cake?

46
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,799
Come back later.
I'll Indian wrestle you.

47
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,342
You're going down, sucker.

48
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,593
We'll see about that.

49
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,929
Okay. Peace, out.

50
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,056
You're going to Syracuse?

51
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,100
I need time to think and so do you.

52
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,434
Think about what?

53
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,312
Your life and why I should
be a part of it.

54
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,273
- All right.
- While you're at it...

55
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,942
...think about getting a real job.

56
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,111
I got a real job!

57
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,828
Patrick Ewing, nice shot.

58
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,290
- Hey, Sonny.
- What's up, buddy boy?

59
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,584
I'm out the door. Hey, pal.

60
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,336
- Where you going?
- Manhattan.

61
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,130
You wanna take me with you?

62
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,591
All right, I guess.

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,634
Hold on to your money.
Later on.

64
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,344
Okay, take care, Sonny.

65
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,971
See you.

66
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,473
Cadillac, I love it.

67
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,162
Surprise!

68
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,080
Just ignore him.

69
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,167
It's only Sonny. It's only Sonny.

70
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,836
Yeah, it's only me. It's only me.

71
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,632
- What's going on?
- Corinne's going-away party for Kevin.

72
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,676
She didn't tell me.
The roommate has a right to know.

73
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,179
She knew you'd ruin the surprise.

74
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,388
No, I wouldn't.

75
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,100
Hey, surprise.

76
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,518
Surprise.

77
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,854
- Surprise.
- Surprise.

78
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,105
What's going on?

79
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,111
We wasted the good surprise on you.

80
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,529
All right.

81
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,205
Is this your handiwork?

82
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,123
I guess.

83
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,209
See you in three hours.

84
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,962
Good to see you stiffs.
What've you been doing?

85
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:00,007
Last three weeks have been crazy.
I've been in Denver, Dallas...

86
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,886
I'm sleeping in the office.
We're going to trial on the fraud case.

87
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,056
Honey, it was a great surprise.
I was totally shocked.

88
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,726
No, you weren't!
And I worked so hard on this.

89
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,228
Need some help?

90
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,897
- Honey, your sister's here.
- Hey, sweetie.

91
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,066
I hate Sonny.

92
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,028
My client's out $7 million. All we
can sue on is breach of contract.

93
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,573
Maybe you can sue under
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

94
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,077
I gotta get back to the office.
You're the king.

95
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,745
Mikey, a pleasure.

96
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,081
- I'll see you at home.
- All right.

97
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,960
I'll walk you out.

98
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,007
I gotta admit, I'm still
weirded out when they kiss.

99
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,759
Why? They're gay.
That's what gay guys do.

100
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,763
I know, but they were like
brothers to us back in school.

101
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,350
They're still like our brothers.
Our very, very gay brothers.

102
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,521
What are you doing after this?
Going to a Klan meeting?

103
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,399
Remember when Dad had
that barbecue...

104
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,359
...for his friends and it rained...

105
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,778
...so he and Mom went into the
kitchen and made...

106
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,115
...100 hamburgers
with one frying pan?

107
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:11,579
You're not gonna let a little rain stop
you from making 100 hamburgers.

108
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,220
That relationship's lasted longer
than I thought it would.

109
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,766
Look at his eyes. He's bored.
I give it two more weeks.

110
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,393
Hey, excuse me. Everybody!

111
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,314
I'm sorry. I wanted to thank you
for coming tonight.

112
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,732
I guess I should say...

113
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,780
I'm getting it.
Tomorrow I'm leaving for China...

114
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,574
...to represent the firm
of Morton and Mandel.

115
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:52,620
Me, the same guy who once shaved
his ass to win a $5 bet.

116
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,830
Prove it!

117
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,167
Just kidding.

118
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,837
But I am real glad you're all here
tonight, because...

119
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,007
...l'm gonna do what I never thought
I'd have the guts to do.

120
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,301
You're not proposing, are you?

121
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,475
- Yeah, pal, I am.
- Well, think about it, you know?

122
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,185
God, Sonny, shut up!

123
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,526
Anyway, will you?

124
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,694
Yeah.

125
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,074
Good call on the two weeks.

126
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,460
Sonny, what was that all about?

127
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,005
Congratulations. You and Big Boobs
McGee are gonna be happy.

128
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,632
Don't call her that.

129
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:51,095
You wanna tell your children you met
their mother as a waitress at Hooters?

130
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,390
Sonny, that was five years ago.
She's a doctor now...

131
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,684
...and my fiancée, so from now on...

132
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,561
...Dr. Big Boobs McGee.

133
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,063
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, man.

134
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,982
I just...

135
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,401
...got shit going on.

136
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,735
What's the matter?

137
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,321
Vanessa's gonna
break up with me...

138
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,116
...and I don't know how
to make her wanna stay.

139
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,702
She's getting older.
She wants different things.

140
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,913
Career, stable relationship, a family.

141
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,331
That's how they get.

142
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,501
I want things to go back
to the way they used to be.

143
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,254
When we were at Syracuse,
and Vanessa worshiped you.

144
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,090
- That was nice.
- Nobody hassled you to get a job.

145
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,134
Tommy and Phil
showered separately.

146
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,761
Those were the days.

147
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,347
- What're you doing?
- Lf I make this...

148
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,892
...Vanessa will realize
she likes me the way I am.

149
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,476
You're going to the putt.

150
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,896
Remember, the roof breaks
to the right.

151
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,233
Yes! That's what I'm talk...

152
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,735
Good God!

153
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,320
That can't be good.

154
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,910
Where's Kevin?

155
00:08:56,203 --> 00:09:00,247
He already left. I guess
he forgot to say goodbye to you.

156
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,751
- Why are you here?
- I'm cleaning because you're useless.

157
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,629
Then what, you gonna go to
your Hooters reunion?

158
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,341
You guys talk about whose ass
hangs out of their shorts the most?

159
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,219
At least I can fit my ass
in my shorts, fatty.

160
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,304
Speaking of fatty, whose is this?

161
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,932
- I don't know.
- I'm eating it then.

162
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,518
"We wasted the good surprise
on you."

163
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,481
Yeah?

164
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,441
Lady gave me $5 to bring him here.

165
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,276
- What do you mean?
- Later.

166
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,946
Are you selling raffle tickets?

167
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,412
Oh, boy.

168
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,876
- Kevin Gerrity.
- I got something to tell you.

169
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,170
- What's up?
- There's a kid here.

170
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,421
What kind of kid?

171
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,882
If this note is true, it's your kid.

172
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,342
What do you mean?

173
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,263
I'm having a tough time
reading this...

174
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,557
...but it says, "Dear Kevin:
This is Julian, your son.

175
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,477
I hope you understand why
I didn't tell you until now...

176
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,356
...but he needs your help.
I can't be his mother anymore."

177
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,316
- This is ridiculous.
- Hang on.

178
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,694
Who's this?

179
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,196
This is my friend.

180
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,701
- Is that Kevin on the phone?
- No, it's my Uncle Remus.

181
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,538
Hi. What's your name?

182
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,123
Is he all right?

183
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,250
He doesn't like you.
Leave us alone.

184
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,876
You're such a dick.

185
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,963
That was your girlfriend.
She was acting "Hooterific."

186
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,966
- Who sent that note?
- "Jan."

187
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,219
Jan...
I don't know any Jan.

188
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,388
- Where's he from?
- Where are you from?

189
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,597
Buffalo.

190
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,891
I've never even been to Buffalo.

191
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,768
Maybe it's a mistake.

192
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,938
Is this like the time
you said my parents were dead?

193
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,773
I swear, he's right here.

194
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,235
I'm coming home.
I don't know what I'll say...

195
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,611
Hang on. It says...

196
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:59,074
..."If you won't take responsibility
for him, they found a foster family..."

197
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,411
Yes, Uncle Remus,
I know the catfish are huge.

198
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,787
That's terrific.

199
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,165
Here's a number for a guy...

200
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,168
...at City Social Service.
Arthur Brooks. I'll call.

201
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,462
- I'll come home.
- I'll take care of it.

202
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,671
Are you sure?

203
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,006
Yeah, don't worry.

204
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,301
Hooters. Hooters. Hooters!

205
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,678
- All right. Thanks a lot.
- Later.

206
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,767
I'm gonna make another phone call.

207
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,519
You want to come and sit down, pal?

208
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:35,027
Or you can stand there.
Anything you want. I'll be a minute.

209
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,115
Social Services
is closed today, Columbus Day.

210
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,701
We'II be open tomorrow at 8 a.m.

211
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,120
Columbus Day.

212
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,124
Boy, I don't know what to tell you.

213
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,710
Everything's gonna get
figured out tomorrow.

214
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,338
Can you be a tough little guy
until then?

215
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,298
Great.

216
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,551
Do I need to get you a bottle
of formula or something?

217
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,054
- No.
- What do you eat?

218
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,555
Food.

219
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,974
Yeah? I eat food too.

220
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,352
What...? Come on.

221
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,148
You need me to hold your hand?

222
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,403
On Mondays, I go to Central Park
and watch rollerbladers fall down.

223
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,738
- You into that?
- I don't know.

224
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,324
Watch. This guy's humming.

225
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,702
He's going down, he's going down,
he's going...!

226
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,415
How old are you, anyways?

227
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,708
- Five.
- Five?

228
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,585
You wear a diaper?

229
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,254
No.

230
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,507
- You wipe your own ass then?
- Yes.

231
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,009
You do? Good job. That's cool.

232
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,847
Come on, fall down. Fall down. Yes!
Come on, damn it.

233
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,723
You suck. You suck!

234
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,268
Check this out.

235
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,032
My God!

236
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,244
There's a stick there.
Somebody should move it.

237
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,664
All right now, what way
would you put that on?

238
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,375
This Columbo, he pretends
to be stupid...

239
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,419
...but he's really smart as a tack.

240
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,920
Oh, yeah, he is.

241
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,091
You put the vane on down there.
Then this boat comes up.

242
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,385
I wipe my own ass.

243
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,596
Me too.

244
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,018
So, Mr. Ass Wiper,
what's this guy's name?

245
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,853
Scuba Steve.

246
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,189
Does he ever take his flippers off?

247
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,191
What if he goes bowling?

248
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,486
They don't make him wear bowling
shoes? He wears flippers?

249
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,947
- Really?
- I had a doll like that at one time.

250
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,783
But my cat, he bite his head off.

251
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,368
What cat would do that?

252
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,620
You calling me a liar?

253
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,538
Hey, take it easy.

254
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,082
Anyways...

255
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,126
...Jets are playing tonight.

256
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,129
We're gonna go to the Blarney Stone.
Wanna come?

257
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,923
I've got more deliveries.

258
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,717
Maybe you can also finish
the turkey on your lip.

259
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,177
Right there.

260
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,892
Let's crank up the Styx.

261
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,727
No music during the game.

262
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,147
- It's halftime. Relax, Mr. Herlihy.
- Goddamn Jets.

263
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,316
What are you doing in here, cutie?

264
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,443
Watching football.

265
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,613
- Who do you want to win?
- The goddamn Jets.

266
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,533
Have fun.

267
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,788
Too bad you don't like girls.
I think you could've had her.

268
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,332
- I'm thirsty.
- You're thirsty?

269
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,460
- Are you allowed soda?
- I don't know.

270
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,671
My mom always said
soda rots your teeth...

271
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,131
...but you'll lose them
anyway, so rot on.

272
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,842
- Can we get two root beers?
- Sure.

273
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:51,181
When I graduated law school, we met
here every Monday to watch football.

274
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,976
Who would meet you?

275
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,061
My friends, Vanessa.

276
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,605
Vanessa always rooted against
the team...

277
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,816
...I wanted to win
just to bust my chops.

278
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,611
But everybody's so busy with
their crap lately, no one comes.

279
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,655
Like I'm not busy?

280
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,450
Shut up or I'll smack you
through the wall like last Monday.

281
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,829
Last Monday was a fluke.
Bring it on, woman.

282
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,126
Anytime.

283
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,504
He drinks a lot of soda.

284
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:31,054
I'm telling you, buddy. Vanessa,
she's the one. I can't lose her.

285
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,056
I'm not getting any handsomer.

286
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,977
Every day I get a little bit older
and balder and fatter.

287
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,187
- Fatter?
- At your age...

288
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,648
...I could eat anything.
Wouldn't gain an ounce.

289
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:45,485
Now, I have a chocolate shake,
my ass jiggles for a week.

290
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,531
- Enjoy the metabolism while you got it.
- Metalobism?

291
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,536
Good God, it's 2:30 in the morning.
You must be wrecked.

292
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,540
Anyways, I had fun today.
Did you have fun?

293
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,209
Yeah, you're all right.

294
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,378
Have a good one.

295
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,589
Sonny?

296
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,217
Could I have a night-light?

297
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,554
Night-light? I think I can
help you out. Hang on.

298
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:22,898
Let's see here.

299
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,735
There you go, all right?

300
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,403
Sonny?

301
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,448
Are you my dad?

302
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,119
No, I'm not, but...

303
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,456
...that Dad and Mom thing
we'll figure out in the morning.

304
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,418
You just go to sleep.

305
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,464
- Good night.
- Good night.

306
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,439
Go get the can, okay?

307
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,692
Go! Go! Go!

308
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,988
I'm thinking about keeping the kid.

309
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,950
Sonny.

310
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,285
Remember when we went to
the pet store...

311
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:21,498
...and you wanted that puppy,
but I reminded you about feeding it...

312
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,792
...cleaning it
and toilet training it?

313
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,920
This is kind of like that,
except with a human.

314
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,507
I mean, I'm glad you had fun and all,
but this is big.

315
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,136
I gotta do something big.
I think Vanessa will respect that.

316
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,638
You think that since women
get pregnant...

317
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,807
...to fix a troubled relationship...

318
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,518
...why can't a guy adopt a kid
to do the same?

319
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:45,355
I didn't think of it like that.
But yes, that's what I'm thinking.

320
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,025
Sounds nuts to me, pal.
Do yourself a favor. Sleep on it.

321
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,111
You're right.
Can I use your phone?

322
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,035
Arthur Brooks speaking.

323
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,037
How you doing?
Kevin Gerrity.

324
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,664
Right on, Mr. Gerrity.

325
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,166
We were expecting you.

326
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,627
Do you still got a foster family
lined up for Julian?

327
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,837
Yes, we do.

328
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,882
I've decided to
take care of the little guy.

329
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,842
Way to sleep on it, pal.

330
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,845
You two want to get married,
I support that.

331
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:21,183
When parents take the responsibility,
there's no bigger high for us.

332
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,851
I'm psyched about it too.

333
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,060
So that's it.

334
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,271
Yep. Good luck
to you and your son.

335
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:28,774
My son.

336
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,404
Goddamn stick!

337
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,072
That's my boy.

338
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,460
Hey.

339
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,588
Go back to sleep.

340
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:57,427
Well, I'm going back to sleep.
Nighty-night.

341
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,596
I wet my bed.

342
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,366
Oh, God.

343
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,118
That's a shitload of piss.

344
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,623
Okay.

345
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,593
There you go, all right?

346
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,637
No more wet mess.

347
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,100
Sleep, all right? Just try to sleep.
Stay asleep.

348
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,884
Sit still!

349
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,510
Lay!

350
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,769
All right! I'm up!

351
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,481
It smells like urine in this joint.
Good job.

352
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,151
What're you doing there, boy?

353
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,694
Making cereal.

354
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,697
Oh, yeah? Why don't you
pour me a bowl?

355
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,829
Or don't pour me a bowl.
Either way.

356
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,832
I got it. I got it.

357
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:53,835
We can fix this.

358
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,547
It's not a big deal.

359
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,424
Look. See?

360
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,843
See how quick it goes away?

361
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,054
Crybaby, come on.

362
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,056
Don't worry about it, boy.

363
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,936
Scuba Steve, damn you!

364
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,648
You think that's funny,
me getting hurt?

365
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:23,031
There's a bright side to being up
before 11: McDonald's breakfast.

366
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,076
I haven't been up for that
in 10 years. You wanna go?

367
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,329
Tie your shoes, we'll go. Hurry.

368
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,375
It's like 12 blocks from here,
so tie quickly.

369
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,464
Do you need help with that?

370
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,257
I can do it.

371
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,469
Let me do it.

372
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,976
You loop it, you swoop it,
and you pull.

373
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,270
You loop it, you swoop it, you pull.

374
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,481
Good. Let's go. We're in a hurry.

375
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,775
It's different for your generation.

376
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,736
You've always had
McDonald's breakfast available.

377
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:02,946
I have?

378
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:06,241
When I was born, all we had were
the burgers and fries.

379
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,911
Maybe the fish sandwich. I'm not sure.
I'll get back to you.

380
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,413
What are you doing?

381
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,915
Oh, yeah, the hand-holding thing.

382
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,920
My dad took us to McDonald's
the first morning they had breakfast.

383
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,632
Everybody was baffled.
"Are these sausages or hamburgers?"

384
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,592
I have to go to the bathroom.

385
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,928
We're gonna be there
in a minute.

386
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,638
I gotta go now.

387
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,515
Didn't you pee enough in bed?

388
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,519
We only got nine minutes
to get there.

389
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:37,772
But I gotta go to the bathroom.

390
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,441
All right, let's go.

391
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,610
Can my kid use the bathroom
for a minute?

392
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,778
Customers only.

393
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,114
He's just a kid.
We'll be in and out.

394
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,657
That's not my problem.

395
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,452
It's not your problem? All right.

396
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:51,828
Come on.

397
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,542
Here you are.
Your waiter will be right with you.

398
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,462
I can't do it.

399
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,964
What do you mean,
you can't do it? Just go.

400
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,551
I'm scared. Could you do it too?

401
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:09,637
All right.

402
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,850
Here we go.

403
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,102
And we're off.

404
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,690
That's not too difficult, right?

405
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,485
And we're both losing weight.

406
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,113
Good job. We're gonna miss
breakfast. Let's go.

407
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,865
Put it away.

408
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:35,497
- Thanks, anyways.
- Sure thing. Anytime.

409
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,332
Move your ass there, pee-boy.

410
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,877
We only got five minutes,
five minutes. Now four.

411
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,338
Come on. We're almost there.

412
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,591
Hey, mister. Why are you
sitting on the ground?

413
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,176
This is where I live.

414
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,512
- We gotta get going.
- Why?

415
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,224
In retrospect, I made some
bad choices after high school.

416
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,309
- We gotta get going.
- Why?

417
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,020
This was during the
so-called Disco Era...

418
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,732
...but for me, it was more
the Doing Mushrooms Era.

419
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,360
- We're gonna miss breakfast.
- Why?

420
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:06,861
I never thought about that.

421
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,614
I was never Mr. Popularity
in high school...

422
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:12,367
...and I watched Fantasia a lot.

423
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,202
- One day it clicked.
- Hey, yappy.

424
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,704
If you end it,
you get an Egg McMuffin.

425
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,040
How about a Sausage McMuffin
with hash browns?

426
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,542
You got a deal.

427
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,754
Look, look. He fell asleep.
Let's go.

428
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,548
Let's go.

429
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,054
Sausage McMuffin.

430
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:34,597
Pardon me, sir.

431
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,057
How you doing?

432
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,767
What can I get for you?

433
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,894
- What do you want?
- Cheerios.

434
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,729
They don't got Cheerios.

435
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:43,606
Lasagna.

436
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,776
What's the matter?
We'll take hotcakes and sausage.

437
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,070
Sorry. We stopped serving breakfast.

438
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,239
We're four seconds late.

439
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,909
You're 30 minutes and four seconds
late. Breakfast stops at 10:30.

440
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,161
Horseshit!

441
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:00,790
Don't cry. Sorry.

442
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,917
I was cursing at the lady, not you.

443
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,252
Nice parenting.

444
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,963
Thanks. Are you my therapist?
Take a walk.

445
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,756
Do you want a Happy Meal?

446
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,550
You got a Happy Meal?

447
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,760
Will somebody get
the kid a Happy Meal?!

448
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,429
Relax.

449
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,972
Where's my Egg McMuffin?

450
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,141
Breakfast is over at 10:30.

451
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:21,269
- Really? I thought it was 11.
- I thought that too.

452
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,564
Total mind blower.

453
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,983
Will you just relax? Here.

454
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,943
What do you want me to do?

455
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,322
You're gonna meet Vanessa tonight.
You'll like her.

456
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,283
You wanna see me get hurt?
That'll cheer you up?

457
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,202
All right.

458
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,709
You think that's funny?

459
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,420
Good. No more crying.

460
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,630
Are you okay?

461
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,840
Next time, kill me.

462
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,024
Let's do it, Rangers.

463
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,777
- Rangers against
the Tampa Bay Lightning.

464
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,320
And at this stage...

465
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,366
...it's as close as you can get
to a must-win game for the Rangers.

466
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,159
Or they'll fall behind...

467
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,328
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

468
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,248
- You like hockey?
- You like hockey?

469
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:27,252
This is a big, important game.

470
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,046
- Cut the crap.
- Cut the crap.

471
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:35,009
I'm serious. Don't do that.

472
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,053
How much wood
would a woodchuck chuck...

473
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,722
...if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

474
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,516
That's what I thought. Shut up.

475
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,769
Don't you take naps?

476
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,062
Sometimes.

477
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,522
Go take a nap.

478
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,691
I'm too hungry to sleep.

479
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,277
You want some food?

480
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,375
Having a kid is great...

481
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,005
...as long as his eyes are closed
and he's not moving or speaking.

482
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,404
He's taken down! Penalty shot!

483
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,078
How you doing? You sleepwalking?

484
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,914
Why don't you go back sleepy?
Sleepy.

485
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,750
Keep napping. What's this?

486
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,959
Kangaroo song.

487
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,880
That's terrific. And we'll watch this
after the game, okay?

488
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,425
But after my nap,
I always watch the kangaroo song.

489
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,596
It's overtime, and there's
a penalty shot about to take place.

490
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:02,889
It happens every 10 years...

491
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,099
Kangaroo song. Kangaroo song!

492
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,730
All right!

493
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,858
God! You were normal yesterday.

494
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,663
I can't take this.
Are you serious?

495
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,415
Come and play

496
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,586
What do you say?

497
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,171
Douche-bag kangaroo.

498
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,426
Are you all hopped out?

499
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,682
I don't know what to do.
Hopefully Vanessa will.

500
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,311
I think she's back.
If she's not back, we'll wait for her.

501
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,021
Get your coat. Clean up.

502
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,776
Oh, God. You don't
have to pee, do you?

503
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,445
- Do you swear?
- I swear.

504
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,657
How come you're not going?

505
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:06,619
I don't have to go. Only you and
my grandfather go every 30 seconds.

506
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,705
Let's hurry it up, all right?
I'm keeping you company.

507
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,669
He'll write your name on the wall.
Mind your business.

508
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,423
Let's go. Let's go.

509
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,509
Why do I need to meet this lady?

510
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,970
- Now it is your problem.
- Thank you.

511
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,139
She's that lady I was
telling you about.

512
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,933
She's gonna be a big part
of your life.

513
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,186
I'm scared. What if she's not nice?

514
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,646
Look.

515
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,692
See these right here?
These are magic sunglasses, okay?

516
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,194
If you're afraid, put them on
to become invisible.

517
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,321
Really? Nobody can see me?

518
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,698
Put them on.

519
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,203
Sonny, I'm right here.

520
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,456
Oh, the glasses. I couldn't see you.

521
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:55,376
Keep those on. No one can notice you
until you decide they can.

522
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,253
- Okay.
- Let's go.

523
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,883
I'm still right here.

524
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,260
Okay, all right, the glasses.

525
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,015
- Hey.
- Hi.

526
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,349
Welcome back.

527
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,020
- Who's that?
- Who's who? He's invisible.

528
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,232
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

529
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,902
Any invisible people out here...

530
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,112
...feel free to come in, okay?

531
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,618
Sonny, I don't really know
what's going on right now.

532
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,871
- We should talk...
- You said I got some thinking to do?

533
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,414
So I did it.

534
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:37,418
Just because I don't have a job
doesn't mean I don't wanna move on.

535
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,921
Instead of saying that,
I figured I'd show you.

536
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,548
- Before you say anything...
- Look at that.

537
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,258
He took his sunglasses off.

538
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,552
He wants you to see him.
He likes you.

539
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,137
Julian, come here.

540
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,932
Come here, pal.

541
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:52,600
Vanessa...

542
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,770
...I want you to meet Julian, my son.

543
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,314
Our son. I adopted him.

544
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,609
I don't know what to say.

545
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,152
Don't say anything.

546
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,115
Is someone in the bathroom?

547
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,536
Why is the door shut?

548
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,080
- I don't know.
- You don't?

549
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,501
- I don't know.
- Sonny.

550
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,171
I can't believe this.

551
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,967
- Hey. Open up.
- Sonny.

552
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,345
Hello. Open the door!

553
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,558
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, my God.

554
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,060
I'm sorry. I was freaking out there.

555
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,853
- I'm Sonny.
- Sid.

556
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:42,066
I had an attack of paranoia. I thought
you were sleeping with my girl.

557
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,651
I am.

558
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,611
What's that?

559
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,321
I am.

560
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,992
That's what I was trying to tell you
before. I found someone.

561
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,160
- This old guy?
- Sid.

562
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,162
He's already achieved so much...

563
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:58,332
...and yet he's still goal-oriented
and still focused.

564
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,084
And he has a five-year plan.

565
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:01,794
What is it? "Don't die"?

566
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:06,841
I can't believe this. We got
a family now. This is what you wanted.

567
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,844
You surprising me with a kid
that you adopted...

568
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,346
...wasn't what I wanted.
- I did this for you.

569
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,807
You wanted me
to be more responsible.

570
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,475
I can't raise this kid alone.

571
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:20,021
You remind me of my grandson.
You don't think things through.

572
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,107
Hey, Old Man River, zip it
or I'll break your hip.

573
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,401
- I'd like to see you try it.
- Shut up.

574
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,195
How'd you misconstrue
the situation so badly?

575
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,114
I don't know.

576
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,909
Deep down you must've known
this day was coming.

577
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,663
You made the biggest mistake
of your life.

578
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,041
I know you'll be missing me
when you got...

579
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,585
...that big, white, wrinkly...

580
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,337
...body on top of you...

581
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,380
...with his loose skin...

582
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,424
...and old balls.

583
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,259
Gross.

584
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,187
Excuse me. How you doing?
I'm Kevin Gerrity.

585
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,190
I got an emergency problem.
Is Arthur Brooks around?

586
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,900
I'll go get him for you.

587
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:09,278
Stay where I can see you.
I gotta talk to this guy.

588
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,946
Mr. Gerrity?

589
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,074
- Arthur Brooks.
- How are you?

590
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,575
I need to speak with you.

591
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:16,869
I didn't tell you to come here, did I?

592
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,121
I was gonna mail you
the paperwork.

593
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,248
It's like the opposite of that.

594
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,668
Look, I can't manage this kid.

595
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,796
I ain't a good father.
I made a big mistake.

596
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:30,591
- Mistake?
- I had a mother lined up for him...

597
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,469
...but she's banging
the Pepperidge Farm guy.

598
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,930
The kid won't stop
peeing and throwing up.

599
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,808
He's like a cocker spaniel.
I just...

600
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,310
He'd be better off
with his natural mother.

601
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:44,939
Well, she passed away last night,
Mr. Gerrity.

602
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:47,274
She had cancer.
She must have sensed...

603
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,485
...that her time was running short.

604
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,446
She wanted her son to be with
the natural father.

605
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:56,701
Loop.

606
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,327
Pull.

607
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,080
If you don't wanna take care
of him...

608
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,834
...we'll take him. But he'll have to
chill in a group home.

609
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,794
Group home? Like an orphanage?

610
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,462
We don't call them that.

611
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,301
Look, I did it.
Loop, swoop and pull.

612
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,511
You did do it.

613
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,138
Congratulations, kid.

614
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,973
I showed him that.

615
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,600
Why don't you
go back over there, okay?

616
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,146
- I'll call the Heatherton Home...
- Let's do this.

617
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,774
I'll hang on to the kid
until you find him a new family.

618
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,319
I don't know. I gotta watch out
for the kid's best interest.

619
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,822
You said yourself you
were a bogus dad.

620
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,199
He's better off with me
than in an orphanage.

621
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,202
I don't wanna put him in a home
any more than you do.

622
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,247
Why don't we pretend you
didn't even come in here?

623
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,375
I'll give you a shout
when I line up a family.

624
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,835
- That's good.
- Later.

625
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,879
Just don't make me regret this.

626
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,131
Where are we going now?

627
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,510
I gotta make a phone call.
Just stay right here, all right?

628
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,518
- This is a collect call from:
- Your baby boy.

629
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,688
- To accept charges, say, "Yes."
- Yeah, I'll accept.

630
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,857
Dad, how's it going?
How's Florida?

631
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:13,652
Not too bad. Your mother got
a sunburn playing tennis.

632
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,822
- I got some interesting news.
- Oh, yeah? What?

633
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,741
Kind of adopted a kid.

634
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:20,075
What do you mean?

635
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,245
I'm talking about
you being a grandfather.

636
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,289
Who the hell would give you a kid?

637
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:26,916
Social Services.

638
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,502
You idiot. You better give
that kid back.

639
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,337
His mother's...

640
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:32,797
Hang on.

641
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,007
Go play with them pigeons, buddy.

642
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:38,427
I tried to give him back.
I just can't. All right?

643
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,095
I need your help.

644
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:44,016
I'm in a bad way. Vanessa dumped
me. I don't know what I'm doing.

645
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,018
You're damn right.

646
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,020
The kid is always around.

647
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,397
He never leaves me alone.

648
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,859
You'd think he'd want some privacy.
I'm in deep shit.

649
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,904
Give that kid back before
you ruin both your lives.

650
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,322
I appreciate that.

651
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,616
He's better off living in a dumpster.

652
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,576
I'll be a better father than you!

653
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,079
Lmpossible!
All you care about is yourself!

654
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:08,707
Yeah? No, I care about you
saving money on this call!

655
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,422
Let's eat.

656
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,968
The Vanessa thing did not work out.

657
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,096
She lost her damn mind.
That wasn't your fault, though, okay?

658
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:23,931
Okay.

659
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,141
I know when you first got here...

660
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,602
...you thought you were gonna
meet your dad.

661
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,146
But I don't think
that's gonna happen.

662
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,774
- Why?
- I don't know.

663
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,944
But, buddy, real dads
aren't always that great.

664
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,113
I got one and he's
out of his mind.

665
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:43,158
He tells me what to do. He never lets
me figure stuff out on my own.

666
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,620
A lot of dads are like that.
That's why people grow up nuts.

667
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,873
Look at this guy.

668
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:52,918
He was probably a nice boy like you.
Then his dad messed his mind up.

669
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,628
Who won the Jets game?

670
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,838
Who cares?

671
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,299
Let it go.
He can't control you anymore.

672
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,508
What do you mean?

673
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,011
- You know.
- You're a loser.

674
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,889
You're mad at your dad, not at me!
I forgive you!

675
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,017
I am. I am. I hate my father.

676
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:11,937
I don't want it to be like that.
I don't wanna control you.

677
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:15,316
- You even like your name?
- I guess.

678
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,693
You guess? Shouldn't you like
your name?

679
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,487
Lt'll be your name
the rest of your life.

680
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:21,947
What do you want?

681
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,618
Frankenstein.

682
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:29,038
I can deal with that.
I'll call you Frankenstein.

683
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,332
Frankenstein, you gonna play
in the puddle?

684
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,793
Go ahead. From now on, you do
whatever you wanna do.

685
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,338
I'll show you some cool shit
along the way.

686
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,131
That's what it's all about.

687
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,177
Stay in front of it.
Don't be scared.

688
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,220
It's coming right at you.

689
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:46,805
Okay. All right.

690
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,433
You're picking your head up.
Don't do that.

691
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,561
Is this okay?

692
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,563
That's what you wanna wear?

693
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,941
That's okay with me then.

694
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,652
Good luck walking down the street.

695
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,072
Way to block it. Stay with it.

696
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,449
You're the next Willie Randolph.

697
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,337
Chief Jay Strongbow
used to do a sleeper hold.

698
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,755
Put your arm under here.

699
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:24,385
Lift this arm, okay? Slide under
and try to lock wrists.

700
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,095
Let me show you. Watch.

701
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,889
Throw him into the ropes
and he comes back...

702
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,059
Get him. Get him. Lock him up.

703
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,686
Lock wrists.

704
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,604
You bring him down slow.

705
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,564
Apply pressure.

706
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,400
He's going to sleep now.

707
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,071
See, he's out.

708
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,624
Wake up.

709
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,591
You'll be the only kid your age
with a slingshot.

710
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,429
Go have some fun. Shoot a few
beer cans or something.

711
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,434
You like that?

712
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,982
Sonny, Sonny, come here!

713
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,151
What is it? What's the matter?

714
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,658
Let me have that.

715
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,662
Go to your room. I think.
Or do whatever you want.

716
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,832
It's gonna be fun. You nervous?

717
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,293
No? You're excited, aren't you?

718
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:42,046
Let's go. Up, up, up.

719
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,549
Here comes some candy.

720
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,137
How you doing?

721
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,098
Happy Halloween!
We got a first-timer.

722
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,063
Do the right thing, buddy.

723
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,440
We want some candy!

724
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,447
Hang on right here for a second.
Don't move.

725
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,671
Yeah, that's it.

726
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,008
Yeah, CDs. You like that?

727
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,887
He's not happy. What else you got?

728
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,100
Okay, that's good. Trick-or-treat.

729
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,395
- Say, "Happy Halloween."
- Happy Halloween.

730
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,648
Thank you.

731
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:45,400
Next year, be prepared, moron.

732
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,364
What's with the cummerbund?

733
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,366
I let him wear whatever he wants.

734
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,076
Those boots are the best.

735
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,120
I think they're Kevin's.

736
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,706
I'll have a hot dog with
the mustard and a knish.

737
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,416
Frankenstein, what do you want?

738
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,127
Thirty packets of ketchup.

739
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,712
All right. Thirty packets of ketchup.

740
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,632
Nice cut, pal.

741
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,718
Frankenstein.

742
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,513
Do that thing I taught you
the other day.

743
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:24,439
It took him 20 minutes to learn that.
He's quick. He's smart.

744
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,692
- And he loves ketchup.
- He does.

745
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,278
This is a whole new school
of child raising.

746
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,906
You give him options, not orders.
Let him make the decision.

747
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,283
You're a pioneer.

748
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,452
- So you two just chill out all day?
- Basically.

749
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:41,123
Hung out on the monkey bars.
The kid did eight chin-ups.

750
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,792
I can't even do one
with these scrawny arms.

751
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,170
They're not scrawny. They're nice.

752
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,256
What do you wanna do tomorrow?

753
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,175
I wanna go to school.

754
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,803
I don't force him, he makes
the right decision. Way to go.

755
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:57,806
We'll enroll you on Monday.
Enjoy the weekend.

756
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,266
Do the thing again.

757
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:09,693
That one touched the ground.

758
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:10,986
That was awesome!

759
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,571
Good job.

760
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:19,328
Help me! Help me!

761
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,497
Please help me.
I don't know where I live.

762
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,000
This isn't a big problem.

763
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,419
We'll find your parents.

764
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,922
- What's your name?
- Frankenstein.

765
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,132
- Frankenstein. Okay.
- There you are.

766
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:34,468
There you are. Are you okay, buddy?

767
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,471
I turn my head and he disappeared.

768
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:40,474
Don't you ever do that to me again.
Don't do that.

769
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:43,644
Thank you for being sweet
to my little boy.

770
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,521
- You're welcome, Sonny.
- Sonny?

771
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,983
I think my sister, Corinne,
is engaged to your roommate.

772
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,986
Your sister's Corinne? That sucks.

773
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,989
Yeah, I'm up from D.C.
I was at that party...

774
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,825
...where we wasted
the good surprise on you.

775
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,118
Sorry about that.

776
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,371
So, what, you have a son now?

777
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,499
I'm not his dad.
I'm more of a father-figure type...

778
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,543
...until Social Services
can get another family.

779
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,837
At which point,
you'll find a new way...

780
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,882
...to initiate conversations
with girls in the park.

781
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,842
Yeah, that's correct.

782
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,594
Hey!

783
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,389
Good job, buddy!

784
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,140
He's peeing on his own.

785
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,976
Keep it flowing! That's it!

786
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,270
Go! Go!

787
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:29,273
So does Corinne's sister
have a name?

788
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:33,402
- It's Layla.
- Layla? I like your song.

789
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,654
Could you do me a favor?

790
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,322
Could you hang out with me?

791
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,200
He'll think he's a failure
if he couldn't get me a date.

792
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,576
I really can't.

793
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,579
I have a ton of work to do.

794
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,915
I see. Hang on a second.

795
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,292
Come here.

796
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,508
Layla, if you don't come over
to Sonny's apartment tonight...

797
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:59,511
...there's a good chance
I'll develop a stutter.

798
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:04,099
P-P-P-Please don't do this to me.

799
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:07,102
- That is so cheap.
- What?

800
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,570
So I'm working in a tollbooth now.

801
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:19,114
I originally wanted to be
a male model...

802
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,576
...but I'm not very good-looking,
so that didn't work out.

803
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,244
I'm sorry to hear that.

804
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:26,204
I'm all right. I'm recovering.

805
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,124
This is my favorite part
of the song right here.

806
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,755
Better keep it down low.
The kid's gonna wake up.

807
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,798
Sonny!

808
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,467
Too late.

809
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,761
Okay. Just hang out a little bit.

810
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,722
I'll be right back.
Don't go sneaking out.

811
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:48,769
- What are you doing?
- You forgot to say good night.

812
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,103
What do you mean?

813
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,939
I can't go to sleep
until you say good night.

814
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,776
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry. Good night.

815
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,944
Go to sleep now, all right?

816
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,613
What'd we learn about girls?

817
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:03,325
Initiating the conversation
is half the battle.

818
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,786
Bingo. Now sleep, okay?

819
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:16,380
I gave him NyQuil.
He should be out for the night.

820
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:21,134
This is Styx. They've been
my favorite band since I was 12.

821
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,469
You're kidding me.

822
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,389
No, I can't help it.
I just love them.

823
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,391
My friends make fun of me.

824
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:31,103
My friends make fun of me too.
I've seen them 25 times.

825
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,022
Tommy Shaw, when I was 16,
I was at the concert...

826
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,483
...and he reached down,
pulled me on stage.

827
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:40,028
- I did the robot voice for "Mr. Roboto."
- Really?

828
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,030
No, I made that up. I'm sorry.

829
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,032
That would've been cool, right?

830
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,201
My cousin's friends
with their drummer...

831
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:48,870
...so when they come to town,
we go to dinner...

832
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,289
...and they tell us stories
from the road.

833
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:54,000
- Really?
- No, I made that up again too.

834
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,836
I'm sorry.

835
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:59,798
You're not attracted to, like,
60-year-old guys, are you?

836
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:03,552
- No.
- Yeah, I don't like them either.

837
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,931
I can't sleep.

838
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:10,684
Okay.

839
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,519
He can't sleep.

840
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,815
So the rabbit ran across the street...

841
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:20,152
...because he thought
he saw some carrots.

842
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,571
But when he got across the street...

843
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:25,740
...it turned out they weren't carrots,
they were peanuts.

844
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,742
Peanuts?

845
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,830
The peanuts belonged to a squirrel...

846
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,375
...who had taken them home
from a baseball game.

847
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,336
And then the rabbit
thought to himself...

848
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,839
..."Carrots, peanuts,
what's the difference?"

849
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:44,384
So he asked the squirrel
if he could have some.

850
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,595
And the squirrel said, "Of course."

851
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:50,891
And the rabbit was very happy
to make such a nice new friend.

852
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,936
And so was the squirrel.

853
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,898
And the rabbit thought the squirrel
had pretty hair.

854
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,067
And nice eyes also.

855
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,113
And the squirrel thought the rabbit
was really nice too.

856
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:09,075
And then, the rabbit
worked up his courage...

857
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,495
...and asked the squirrel
if he could have...

858
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:14,498
...just the littlest squirrel kiss.

859
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:19,127
And the squirrel thought
it just wasn't the right time...

860
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,422
...in her busy squirrel life
to be kissing any rabbits...

861
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:26,092
...even though this particular rabbit
was very sweet.

862
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,929
And the rabbit got shut down,
did he?

863
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:35,477
That's all right.
But he was still thinking maybe...

864
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:38,563
...Scuba Steve could get
a squirrel kiss...

865
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,815
...so somebody's getting
some action.

866
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,824
Good night, Scuba Steve.

867
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,160
Good night, Frankenstein.

868
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,413
Good night, Sonny.

869
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,290
Good night, Layla.

870
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,337
Don't get caught with any girls.

871
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,631
It's your first day. Take it slow.

872
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,801
I'll meet you after school
at 2:30, right out front.

873
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:09,594
You're not staying?

874
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,305
No, I gotta go get you
some more ketchup.

875
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:14,140
I don't like these kids.

876
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,352
I don't either,
but shouldn't we give them a chance?

877
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,314
How's this?

878
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,986
Here are the magic sunglasses.

879
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:29,072
You put them on
if you feel scared, okay?

880
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,200
I lost you.

881
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,703
I don't know where you are.
I'm sorry.

882
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,330
Oh, there you go.

883
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,084
You go inside
and make some friends.

884
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,878
Oh, yeah, that's a good hug.

885
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,881
All right. Go inside.
I'm gonna miss you.

886
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,387
Hi, I like your hat.

887
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,180
What's your name?

888
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:12,157
- Might as well...
- Leave a message!

889
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:16,870
Mr. Gerrity, this is Arthur Brooks from
Social Services. I got good news.

890
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:19,331
We may have found
a family for Julian.

891
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,916
Give me a call back
as soon as possible...

892
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,669
...so we can set up a meeting. Bye.

893
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,140
Sierra Club Legal Department.

894
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,017
Can I speak to Layla Maloney?

895
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,645
Layla, line four.

896
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,774
- Hello?
- You're a lawyer?

897
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,609
What are you doing?

898
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:51,154
Waiting for Julian so I can have
somebody to play with.

899
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,531
- What are you doing?
- I'm swamped.

900
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,867
I gotta do my laundry
on my lunch hour.

901
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:59,079
I was gonna do my laundry today too.
Where are you going?

902
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:02,082
There's a place nearby,
Suds, on Bleecker.

903
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,210
I know that place.
Maybe I'll see you there then.

904
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,712
Maybe. I gotta go.

905
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,642
I bought tickets
and the show was the night before.

906
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:21,935
Maybe it was a mistake.

907
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:26,064
That's nice, but you don't know
what's going down on the streets.

908
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,233
It's hard to know what's going down...

909
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:31,945
...when you're in an office
seven days a week, Mr. Tollbooth.

910
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:34,447
You're not gonna tell me
to get a real job.

911
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,741
No. You're a big boy.

912
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,952
It's cool you only work
one day a week.

913
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,789
These are the cutest things
I've ever seen.

914
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:46,710
I know. I have them in yellow.
I wear them when I work out.

915
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:51,256
It's great what you're doing
with Julian while you got him.

916
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,716
Yeah, well, I got him.

917
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,634
I read an article that said...

918
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:58,179
...the most important influences
in a kid's life are his friends.

919
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,597
They said that?

920
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:02,434
Just hope he's not hanging out
with drug dealers...

921
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,018
...and delinquents in school.

922
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:07,647
I'm kidding.

923
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,150
I know. I know.

924
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,863
Man, this Yoo-Hoo is good.
You know what else is good?

925
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:16,740
Smoking dope.

926
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,658
I ain't going to rat you out.

927
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,160
Puffing the cheeba.

928
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:24,164
Go by the seesaw, smoke a J.
You know what I'm talking about?

929
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,166
I have a bellybutton.

930
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:29,043
You have a bellybutton?
We all have bellybuttons.

931
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:32,380
And we all love Yoo-Hoo.
Especially with a little rum.

932
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,841
- What's rum?
- You don't know?

933
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,134
Rumpelstiltskin?

934
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,094
Rumpelstiltskin.

935
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,889
Rumpelstiltskin's a good man.
So are you guys.

936
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,184
Stay clean. Stay focused.

937
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,061
Frankenstein,
have fun with your friends.

938
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,565
Why are you scratching so much?

939
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,817
I have ecza...

940
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,486
Eczema? Gross.

941
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,362
How do I make it stop itching?

942
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:59,032
I don't know. You scratch it.

943
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,409
Spaghetti-O's. Do you like
Spaghetti-O's?

944
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:05,914
Dented cans are half price.

945
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:09,542
Microsoft went down three points.
We gotta save some money.

946
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,296
Here, give it a shot.

947
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,299
That's it, boy.

948
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,218
Put it in there. Feels good.

949
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:21,054
Hi, Sonny.
Hi, Sonny's friend.

950
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,430
His name's Frankenstein.

951
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,557
Hi, Frankenstein. Remember me?

952
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,560
Help me. I'm lost.
I don't know where I am.

953
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,187
You don't gotta do that.

954
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,440
You guys wear the same size
T-shirt. That's cool.

955
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,901
I heard you did laundry
with my sister.

956
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,444
She said we did laundry?

957
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,531
Where I'm from, it's called
doing the hibbity-dibbity.

958
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:42,575
I got eczema.

959
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:45,286
Well, then you shouldn't scratch it.

960
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:48,206
Don't tell him what to do.
He can scratch.

961
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,124
- Scratch.
- Is that better?

962
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:52,210
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

963
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:55,421
You know about kids?
I thought you were a foot doctor.

964
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:59,759
It's not doctor stuff. It's common
sense. Scratching spreads rashes.

965
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:02,262
This is something
you learned at Hooters.

966
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,394
- What the hell is he doing?
- He's shopping.

967
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,105
Microsoft went down three points.

968
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:15,108
That's good.
See you later, Frankenstein.

969
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:18,862
Stay away from the frozen-food
section. Your boobs'll harden.

970
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,955
Isn't Little Italy the greatest?

971
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:33,293
I like it. Everyone always tells me
to hang out in the Village and SoHo.

972
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,502
That's all right.

973
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:38,882
But you gotta respect a place where
the fatter you are, the cooler you are.

974
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:46,806
Last time, he was with
a different girl. I guess he ate her.

975
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,353
I went to Coney Island today
with the little boy.

976
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,689
You gotta take a look at this.

977
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,941
We had a blast together.

978
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,153
He's so happy.

979
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:01,821
He is such a good boy.

980
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:05,491
If I have a kid of my own,
I hope he's half as cool as that kid.

981
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,493
Is he picking your nose?

982
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,038
Yeah, he was picking his own
all day...

983
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,624
...so I figured he could borrow mine.
- Sweet.

984
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:15,418
He must be miserable
without you right now.

985
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,211
No, he's in good hands.

986
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,925
Look at Brad's body.
Not an ounce of fat on it.

987
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,928
- What?
- Don't worry. I like yours better.

988
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,350
I got two queens, two jacks
and an ace.

989
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,226
- I win.
- Why do you win?

990
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:36,356
I got a two, a four, a 10,
an eight and a six.

991
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,358
I don't understand.
Why do you win?

992
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,860
- Because I win.
- What's the name of that game?

993
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,070
I win.

994
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,863
I'll get it!

995
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:48,034
- What's up?
- I'm looking for Kevin Gerrity.

996
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,994
He's in China. Who are you?

997
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:53,748
Arthur Brooks, New York City
Social Services. I'm confused.

998
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,542
Chinatown. He loves
those egg rolls.

999
00:54:56,961 --> 00:55:00,880
I've tried contacting him several times
and he hasn't responded.

1000
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,423
I'm concerned.

1001
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:04,384
Lx-nay on the ketchup-nay.

1002
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,552
- Have him call me.
- All right.

1003
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,889
My body's definitely better than his.

1004
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,975
Without question.

1005
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:20,066
It took you a long time to pencil me in.
You work all the time.

1006
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,442
I know. I'm excited.

1007
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:24,237
You're excited.
How long you been this crazy?

1008
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,574
I guess ever since
I was a little girl.

1009
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:33,746
See, my mom got married really young
and pretty much just raised us kids.

1010
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:35,790
So when my dad took off...

1011
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,584
...she wasn't left
with a lot of options.

1012
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,796
And I think that's when I decided...

1013
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:44,590
...that I never wanted to end up
in that situation.

1014
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,802
That's actually a good reason
to be working.

1015
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:51,806
I guess I feel like I gotta kick ass
while there's ass to be kicked.

1016
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:56,269
You kick that ass during the day,
but at night you have fun with Sonny.

1017
00:55:57,271 --> 00:56:01,524
The best of times

1018
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:07,030
Are when I'm alone with you

1019
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:13,453
Some rain, some shine

1020
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:24,172
Two guys you were best friends with
in law school...

1021
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,049
...fell in love with each other?

1022
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,633
Is that strange for you?

1023
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,844
No. Nothing changed, really.

1024
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:33,306
They watch a different kind
of porno now. But that's it.

1025
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,183
Hello.

1026
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,977
My God! This is Corinne's place?

1027
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:40,813
If the girls at Hooters
could see her now.

1028
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:45,151
- Do you want your ass kicked?
- I'm just kidding around, Layla.

1029
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:53,076
You're afraid to get involved
and you got a lot of work, but...

1030
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:57,663
...when I'm not with you, I'm thinking
of you. Do you have that going on?

1031
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,123
Maybe.

1032
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,834
Maybe we should try a kiss out.

1033
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:06,339
We owe it to ourselves to see
if we should move to the next level.

1034
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:08,716
I'm not sure.

1035
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:12,011
Me either. It's just that
you kissed Scuba Steve.

1036
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,847
Ever since then,
he's strutted around bragging...

1037
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:19,310
..."I got a kiss the first night.
After three times, you got nothing."

1038
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,853
- He said that?
- Come on.

1039
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:24,357
Let's just give it a shot
just so I can have some dignity.

1040
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:25,900
All right?

1041
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,076
Oh, my God!

1042
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:36,702
Gross!

1043
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,371
Did I witness the first kiss?

1044
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:41,165
Yeah, you did.
Thanks a lot for showing up.

1045
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,877
Layla, you didn't actually
enjoy that, did you?

1046
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,588
I don't know. I'm going upstairs.

1047
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,007
Wash your mouth out. He's dirty.

1048
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:51,843
And he's poor.

1049
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:56,055
What do you got in the bag, Corinne?
Some chicken wings? Booby tassels?

1050
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,390
Shut up.

1051
00:57:57,558 --> 00:57:59,058
You have a good sleep.

1052
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,852
Pleasant Hooters.

1053
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,233
Come on, come on!

1054
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:09,443
This is where we hang our jackets.

1055
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:10,903
This is my hook.

1056
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,405
That's a capertillar.

1057
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:13,865
A caterpillar.

1058
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:17,410
- That's right, a capertillar.
- Capertillar, all right.

1059
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,287
- Staying clean, pal?
- Yes.

1060
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:22,456
You drink the booze, you lose.
Remember that, punk.

1061
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,210
I'm Julian's teacher, Ms. Foote.

1062
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,588
- You his father?
- I'm Kevin Gerrity.

1063
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,424
Do you have some time
to go over some things...

1064
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:34,135
...that have been bothering me?
- Sure.

1065
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:36,179
Go take a walk, pal.

1066
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,432
Julian has been displaying
some odd behavior.

1067
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,935
He spilled glue on the floor
and didn't tell anyone.

1068
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,812
He covered it with newspaper.

1069
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:49,984
And then one of our students wore
Rollerblades for show-and-tell.

1070
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:52,778
And Julian tripped him with a stick.

1071
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,113
I've never...

1072
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,659
Julian found it hilarious.

1073
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:01,245
I like him to express himself freely.

1074
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:04,457
I've really never seen
any problems with that.

1075
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:11,505
Your boy's making the least progress
of any of the children.

1076
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:15,843
Frankly, his personal hygiene
is becoming a cause for concern.

1077
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:19,722
He's the smelly kid in class?
I let him become the smelly kid?

1078
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:21,140
What's wrong with me?

1079
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,309
I've had some smelly ones before.

1080
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,978
But your son is by far the smelliest.

1081
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,981
All right, I got you.
What do you think I should do?

1082
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,859
Start by paying more attention
to his schoolwork.

1083
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,947
The class is giving a presentation
of the Founding Fathers.

1084
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:40,326
Julian has drawn the part of Benjamin
Franklin, a very important role.

1085
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:41,786
Do what you can to help.

1086
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,747
I will turn this all around.
That's a promise.

1087
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,332
Thank you very much.

1088
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,043
Stinky, let's go.
You got us in trouble.

1089
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,544
Did he call him "Stinky"?

1090
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,676
Wow, I didn't know this
about George Washington.

1091
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,303
Yes, his teeth were made of wool.

1092
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,055
Wood.

1093
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:03,808
I sorry. I mix up "D" and "L."

1094
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,268
Well, get it right.

1095
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,688
Turn that game off, pal.

1096
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,189
I got four guys left.

1097
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:11,983
Let's study a little bit.

1098
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:13,359
I don't wanna study.

1099
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:14,568
Give me that.

1100
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,572
- You just killed me.
- So what? You'll play later.

1101
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,408
You can't tell me what to do.

1102
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:24,578
Really? Let's take a vote.
Who thinks the kid should study?

1103
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:29,083
Who doesn't?
Well, you just lost, two to one.

1104
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:32,586
It's a tie. That guy doesn't count.
He can't even read.

1105
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:36,048
I know. He was just joking around.

1106
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,344
Can you hang out here a little bit?
I gotta go do something.

1107
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:41,721
No problem.

1108
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,432
Would you like

1109
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,394
We'II hop, hop, hop, hop

1110
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,313
What do you say?

1111
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,441
Get the door.

1112
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,907
Hi, Julian. How you doing?

1113
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,285
I'm Scuba Sam.

1114
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:06,078
Scuba Steve's father.

1115
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,580
You see, my boy...

1116
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,582
...needs to take a bath.

1117
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,459
The only problem is...

1118
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,753
...he's afraid to bathe alone.

1119
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,546
So I was wondering...

1120
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:19,258
...if maybe you could
keep him company in the tub.

1121
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:24,263
Terrific. And after the bath,
you have to try and study hard.

1122
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:27,725
Because if you wanna be a member
of the Scuba Squad...

1123
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:29,268
...you have to be smart.

1124
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:31,604
I could be in the Scuba Squad?

1125
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:35,358
Well, sure. All you have to do
is work hard.

1126
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:38,152
And don't tell a soul
about the Scuba Squad...

1127
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:40,613
...because then everybody will
wanna join.

1128
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:42,281
And one more thing...

1129
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:44,784
...be nice to the delivery guy,
would you?

1130
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,079
It's not his fault he can't read.

1131
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:50,581
Take care.

1132
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:58,297
He told me to watch his boat for him.
Said that he wanted to...

1133
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:01,133
...talk to you about
some secret mission.

1134
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:04,136
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1135
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,721
Okay.

1136
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,600
How come I have to wear
a bathing suit?

1137
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,310
I don't know the rules...

1138
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:15,773
...with little kids and grownups
and being naked and just sit down.

1139
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:21,529
The good news is you're not
smelling like a foot anymore.

1140
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,533
I read something interesting. You
know Benjamin Franklin invented...

1141
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,785
...bifocals? That's pretty cool.

1142
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:28,994
What are they?

1143
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:33,332
I'll show you in that book. It might
help you out with your school play.

1144
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,835
We'll make this a regular thing.

1145
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:39,171
Bathing and studying
and eating right.

1146
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:42,049
Put your head back.
My grandmother did this to me.

1147
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:47,012
"Oh, boy. When I was a little girl,
frankfurters only cost a nickel."

1148
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:48,514
Can you still have fun?

1149
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,474
Yeah, but after you study.

1150
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:53,727
In fact, we gotta get you
dressing differently.

1151
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:56,147
- We'll go to Barney's.
- Barney?

1152
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,442
Not that Barney.
A more expensive Barney.

1153
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,703
All right, one at a time.

1154
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,455
That's one.

1155
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:14,206
Two.

1156
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,544
See? Urinals are good too.

1157
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,733
"Electricity."

1158
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:41,984
Very good.

1159
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:43,444
"Constitution."

1160
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:44,862
That's it.

1161
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,280
"Philadelphia."

1162
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,615
Smart. Good.

1163
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,494
"Fish"?

1164
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:54,788
"Pony"?

1165
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,791
"Hip..."

1166
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,377
"Hiphop..."

1167
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:01,587
"Hipopynonamous"?

1168
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:06,008
Damn you!
You gave him the easy ones!

1169
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:10,930
- Thanks!
- You're welcome.

1170
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,601
Slow down.

1171
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:19,104
- You owe me a Sausage McMuffin.
- Okay.

1172
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:27,530
There's a pole there.

1173
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,166
My name is Alexander Hamilton.

1174
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:42,253
I was the first Secretary
of the Treasury.

1175
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,838
I owned a bank and a newspaper.

1176
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,424
Aaron Bird shot me.

1177
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,931
Hi, my name is Benjamin Franklin.

1178
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:56,809
I was a writer, a diplomat...

1179
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,311
...an inventor and a statesman...

1180
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:03,649
...although I only went to school
for two years.

1181
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:09,196
I wrote many books and invented
many things we still use today.

1182
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:17,663
The Declaration of Independence
is finished.

1183
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:21,000
Who will be the first to sign?

1184
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:24,628
- How about you, John Hancock?
- I want to sign!

1185
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,594
- Look at my man stand strong.
- He's so cute.

1186
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:38,642
What are your cards?

1187
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:43,606
I got a six, a five, a jack,
a four and a eight.

1188
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:46,025
- I win.
- What do you mean?

1189
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:48,694
I had a hand just like that.
I didn't win.

1190
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:51,322
- Because I win.
- This is bullshit!

1191
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:53,198
All right. Take it easy, man.

1192
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:55,200
Every time it's different cards.

1193
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,077
So what? Relax. He's a kid.

1194
01:05:57,245 --> 01:06:00,539
There should be same set of rules,
no matter what age.

1195
01:06:00,749 --> 01:06:02,750
He's gotta learn how to lose too.

1196
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:05,586
- Hello, Mr. Koufax.
- Mr. Brooks, how you doing?

1197
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:07,546
I was gonna give you a buzz.

1198
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:11,258
You just called me Mr. Koufax,
didn't you?

1199
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,594
It is your name, isn't it?
Sonny Koufax?

1200
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:16,347
You held yourself out
to be Kevin Gerrity...

1201
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:18,557
...to gain custody of young Julian.

1202
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,726
Big problem in this state.

1203
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,728
I've delivered to you before.

1204
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:25,356
You always order
three pieces of cheesecake.

1205
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,942
The real Kevin Gerrity
asked me to take care of...

1206
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,944
Save it, Mr. Koufax.

1207
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:33,572
He has to come with me
or I'll arrest you.

1208
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,074
Take out your handcuffs.

1209
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:38,160
I don't have any,
but two policemen downstairs do.

1210
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,913
Listen, Sonny, I would like to help...

1211
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:44,917
...but my status in your country
is not what you would call legal.

1212
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:46,251
It's okay.

1213
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:47,711
I'm Audi.

1214
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,756
Julian, you're gonna have to
come with me.

1215
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:52,383
- Just give me...
- Sonny.

1216
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:54,426
One second, pal.

1217
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,807
Would you just give me a second
to say goodbye to the kid?

1218
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:01,934
Take a second.

1219
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,486
You don't want me here anymore?

1220
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,655
No, that's not it, pal.

1221
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:17,157
You just gotta go away
for a little while.

1222
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:19,827
How long am I going away for?

1223
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,995
I don't wanna lie to you.

1224
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,125
I don't think we're gonna...

1225
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,752
...be seeing each other anymore.

1226
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,090
I screwed up, pal. I'm so sorry.

1227
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,342
Come here.

1228
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,219
Put your coat on.

1229
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,436
It's not your fault, okay?
I'm the idiot.

1230
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:47,813
- I don't wanna go.
- I know you don't.

1231
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:50,441
But you have to,
and you're gonna be okay.

1232
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:55,529
Please don't make me go.

1233
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:58,198
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what else to do.

1234
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,868
I won't play
the kangaroo song anymore.

1235
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:02,786
Come on.

1236
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:04,663
Just go. You gotta go.

1237
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:05,998
You gotta go.

1238
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,335
I don't wanna go. I promise...

1239
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,505
...l'm sorry. I don't even
like that song anymore.

1240
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,841
I know, pal. That's not it.

1241
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:19,178
But I wipe my own ass!
I wipe my own ass!

1242
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,347
I know.

1243
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,911
- Layla, they took the kid.
- Who?

1244
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,580
Social Services.
I gotta get him back.

1245
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,707
You said this was just temporary.

1246
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,835
I can't have it be temporary.
It's gotta be permanent.

1247
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,712
Okay, what can we do?

1248
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:57,341
I filed to get custody based
on the child's best interests.

1249
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:01,386
Tommy knew a clerk, so they
fast-tracked the hearing. It's Tuesday.

1250
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,388
- This Tuesday?
- You got work?

1251
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:06,600
I gotta go to Washington
for a hearing to dismiss my case.

1252
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,393
Can you get somebody else?

1253
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:11,104
I'm sorry, Sonny.
I can't. It's my case.

1254
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:14,441
We don't even know where
this kid's gonna end up.

1255
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:18,237
Sonny, this is exactly why
I didn't wanna get involved.

1256
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,405
I had things going the way I wanted.

1257
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:24,493
Then at the park, you and this kid
come barging into my life...

1258
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,704
...and it's screwing up everything
I had planned.

1259
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:30,916
You think I planned on a kid
showing up on my doorstep?

1260
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,709
But I fell in love with him.

1261
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:36,046
So now my plans have changed.

1262
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,519
All rise.

1263
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:43,780
We're here to determine
proper custody of Julian McGrath...

1264
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:47,200
...also known as Julian Gerrity,
a minor child.

1265
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,994
Representing New York City?

1266
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:50,537
Ted Castellucci.

1267
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,664
Arthur Brooks, Social Services.

1268
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,833
And representing Sonny Koufax?

1269
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,168
Phillip D'Amato.

1270
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:57,419
Thomas Grayton.

1271
01:10:57,712 --> 01:11:00,297
Plus, I'll pretty much
be representing myself.

1272
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:01,548
Anyone else?

1273
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:04,009
Layla Maloney, Your Honor.

1274
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,640
- Thank you.
- Does this mean that you love me?

1275
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:11,433
Something like that.

1276
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,727
First witness.

1277
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:16,688
Koufax is a good egg.
He was nice to that kid.

1278
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,692
But he fights like a girl.
You like that?

1279
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:22,694
I'm right here, miss.

1280
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,696
What are you gonna do about it?

1281
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,241
Are you drunk, Mr. Herlihy?

1282
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:31,203
I had a few chardonnays.
What of it?

1283
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,246
Get off the stand.

1284
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,040
You got it.

1285
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,084
I've got a few problems.

1286
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,752
Off to a good start.

1287
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:43,840
Mr. Koufax is a really cool guy.
I wish my dad was as cool as him.

1288
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,759
My dad was a military man.

1289
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:49,554
Guess I wasn't such a "good soldier."

1290
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:54,768
When I was 35, he attempted to give
me a crew cut while I was sleeping.

1291
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,562
I broke his arm,
haven't seen him since.

1292
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:01,024
I'd rather live on the streets
than under his rules.

1293
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:11,994
Anyway, I think Mr. Koufax should be
acquitted of all the charges.

1294
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:17,249
If O.J. Can get away with murder,
why can't Sonny have his kid?

1295
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,627
This guy knows
what I'm talking about.

1296
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:24,631
No more questions.

1297
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:27,968
No more questions...

1298
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,887
How long have you delivered food
to Mr. Koufax?

1299
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,764
I deliver food for six years.

1300
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:36,018
Plus, I'm stripper.
But I've put on weight so it's problem.

1301
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:40,313
I see. And in your experience,
was Sonny a good father to Julian?

1302
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:43,275
Oh, yes. They make terrific pair.

1303
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:45,944
They went together like
lamb and tuna fish.

1304
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,322
Lamb and tuna fish?

1305
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:53,535
Spaghetti and meatball? You more
comfortable with that analogy?

1306
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:55,954
Yes, considering we're in America.

1307
01:12:56,164 --> 01:12:58,790
If you don't like spaghetti
and meatballs, get out.

1308
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:00,542
I'll come give you a crew cut.

1309
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,169
Let's see your clippers.

1310
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,171
Not my problem your dad was sick.

1311
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:08,050
Stop yelling at me!

1312
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,680
Order! Order! Order!

1313
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:15,432
Am I in the right room?

1314
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:16,808
Who the hell are you?

1315
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,685
I'm Mr. Koufax's co-counsel.

1316
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:20,645
He has enough co-counsels.

1317
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:22,481
Well...

1318
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:24,983
...one more won't hurt.

1319
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:26,651
Let's get on with it.

1320
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:29,863
Mr. Koufax is simply parading
his buddies up there.

1321
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:32,491
Can't they find someone
who isn't a friend?

1322
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,993
What were Julian
and Mr. Koufax doing?

1323
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,203
Shopping.

1324
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:39,331
Did he appear to be
an attentive, loving father?

1325
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:40,999
He certainly did.

1326
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:43,543
And how long have you
disliked Mr. Koufax?

1327
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,045
Since the day I met him.

1328
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:48,340
For the record, where did you work
during medical school?

1329
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,218
Hooters.

1330
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,805
No further questions.

1331
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:57,182
Asshole.

1332
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:58,725
Next witness.

1333
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:01,311
We'd like to call Julian McGrath.

1334
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,537
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

1335
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,580
This is just you and me talking...

1336
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:22,916
...so don't pay attention to
these people.

1337
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:25,210
Can you tell me how old you are?

1338
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,630
Your Honor, one second.

1339
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,395
That's better, huh?

1340
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,438
Can you tell me
how old you are?

1341
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,023
Five.

1342
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,525
What's your birthday?

1343
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,402
July 15th.

1344
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:51,778
Where were you born?

1345
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,071
Toronto.

1346
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:55,699
Toronto? I thought you were
from Buffalo.

1347
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,785
I moved to Buffalo with my mommy.

1348
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:02,205
For the past six weeks, you've been
living with Sonny?

1349
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:03,999
Yes.

1350
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,960
- Did you and Sonny have fun?
- Yes.

1351
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:08,920
What kind of things would you do?

1352
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:13,091
He taught me how to do the sleeper
hold like Chief Jay Strongbow.

1353
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:14,968
That's nice.

1354
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:16,219
Anything else?

1355
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,805
He taught me how to pee
on a building.

1356
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:20,307
Really?

1357
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:28,607
And he taught me that Styx was one
of the greatest American rock bands.

1358
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:30,609
They only caught a bad rap...

1359
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:34,279
...because most critics
are cynical assholes.

1360
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,992
I think we'd all agree with that.

1361
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:43,163
Before you came here,
do you remember...

1362
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:45,457
...the last thing
your mommy said to you?

1363
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:49,252
That she loved me and I was gonna
live with my new daddy.

1364
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,339
If your mother could pick anyone
to be your new daddy...

1365
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,840
...who would she pick?

1366
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,717
Sonny.

1367
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:57,844
Thank you, Julian.

1368
01:15:58,095 --> 01:15:59,512
You can step down now.

1369
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:06,102
That went good, don't you think?

1370
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:09,314
I don't know.
Judge doesn't look too happy.

1371
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:12,234
Mr. Koufax, anyone else?

1372
01:16:16,948 --> 01:16:19,282
I'd like to call upon myself,
Your Honor.

1373
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,784
Awesome.

1374
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:24,120
Which of your esteemed co-counsels
will examine you?

1375
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,375
My father, Lenny Koufax.

1376
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:29,793
What?

1377
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:31,628
Forget it, Sonny.

1378
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,338
What is going on?

1379
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:37,801
Nobody in this world thinks I shouldn't
have a child more than that man.

1380
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:41,680
He also happens to be
a well-respected lawyer in Florida.

1381
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:46,017
If I can make a believer out of him, I
can make a believer out of everybody.

1382
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:50,772
This court is after the truth, not
the opinion of the defendant's father.

1383
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:53,358
You want my opinion?
My son is a moron.

1384
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,986
I withdraw my objection.
Please proceed.

1385
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:57,988
Mr. Koufax.

1386
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:02,575
This is a big mistake.

1387
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:06,496
I only came today to make sure
you didn't end up in jail.

1388
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:08,540
That was nice of you. Thank you.

1389
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:11,584
To do what I think is right here.

1390
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:14,379
Cut your fingernails.
They're too long.

1391
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:15,547
Okay, Dad.

1392
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:17,173
This case is simple.

1393
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:22,887
It is absurd to think that Sonny Koufax
is ready to raise a child.

1394
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:24,848
- Objection!
- Shut up, Tommy.

1395
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:26,933
Sorry, Mr. Koufax.

1396
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,394
First of all, how did...

1397
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:34,107
...this sweet little boy, Julian,
end up under your supervision?

1398
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:38,445
I told Social Services
that my name was Kevin Gerrity.

1399
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:41,114
- Of course, you are not Kevin Gerrity.
- No.

1400
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:42,824
- So you lied.
- Yes.

1401
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:46,077
Like the time I found a bag of pot
in your drawer...

1402
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:49,122
...and you said you thought
they were pencil shavings.

1403
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,082
Yeah.

1404
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:54,794
Remember when I told you Aunt Fay
was coming to New York...

1405
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:57,213
...and I wanted you to
show her the city?

1406
01:17:57,423 --> 01:17:59,924
And you said that you had
better things to do.

1407
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,259
That's right.

1408
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:05,472
I'm curious. Just what were those
better things that you had to do?

1409
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,644
Jethro Tull had a reunion concert
in New Jersey, so I caught that.

1410
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,358
What happened to Aunt Fay
that weekend?

1411
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,234
She died.

1412
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:19,444
Yes, she did.

1413
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:23,448
Did you happen to make it
to her funeral?

1414
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:28,286
- Why not?
- I went to Jones Beach...

1415
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:30,163
...got drunk and fell asleep.

1416
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:31,456
Hell, yes!

1417
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:33,958
Some role model.

1418
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,170
Your Honor...

1419
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,964
...my son doesn't have
health insurance.

1420
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:42,133
He doesn't know how to boil an egg.

1421
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:45,887
He filed for social security
at the age of 30.

1422
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:49,307
He is a drain on the economy,
on the country...

1423
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:51,351
...and most of all, on me!

1424
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:57,315
Your Honor,
to give this young man...

1425
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:02,320
...custody over another life
is not only wrong...

1426
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:03,822
...it's insane.

1427
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:12,664
Hey. I love you.

1428
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:16,960
- What?
- Don't be scared. It's all right.

1429
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:18,545
I'm not scared.

1430
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,840
If I get custody of Julian,
I'll be his father forever.

1431
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:25,969
That scares you because you think
there's a good chance I'll fail.

1432
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:30,056
Sonny, it's more than a chance.
It's a certainty.

1433
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,516
You're wrong, Dad.

1434
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:36,229
You can be scared that I might get
pickpocketed in a bad neighborhood...

1435
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:38,398
...or break my legs skiing.

1436
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:42,402
But don't be scared about me
being a dad, because I will not fail.

1437
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:44,612
I love this kid too much.

1438
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:47,365
I love him as much as
you love me, Dad.

1439
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:50,243
I'm gonna give him advice
and I'm gonna guide him...

1440
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:52,662
...and I'll be there
whenever he needs me.

1441
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:55,748
I'll fly to New York to be
at his court case...

1442
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,918
...even if I disagree with
why he's there.

1443
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:02,505
But, Sonny, you work in a tollbooth.

1444
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,090
Don't worry about money.

1445
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,594
I am in love with a beautiful girl
who makes plenty of it.

1446
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:10,138
She'll be my sugar mama.

1447
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,016
I gotta get me one of those.

1448
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:17,687
I know this is the right thing
because I would die for this kid...

1449
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:20,440
...just so he won't feel
one ounce of sadness.

1450
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:25,028
That's why you're here right now,
to protect me, to be scared for me...

1451
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,238
...to be a good father.

1452
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,658
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna be.

1453
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:36,748
Hello, Dad?

1454
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:39,584
Yeah, I just
wanted to say I love you.

1455
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:43,338
Hi, Mom? Could you put Dad
on the phone for a second?

1456
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,551
Can I borrow that
when you're done?

1457
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:50,929
Your Honor...

1458
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:53,973
...my son deserves this kid.

1459
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:07,779
I love you too, sir.

1460
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:11,324
Mr. Koufax...

1461
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:14,327
...the fact is
you kidnapped this child.

1462
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:16,412
Not only
shouldn't you get custody...

1463
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:19,666
...but since you obtained him
by defrauding the state...

1464
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:21,960
...you should be in jail.

1465
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:25,797
Bailiff, remand him until
I can figure out the punishment.

1466
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:27,966
Wait. You can't take him away.

1467
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:32,554
As that boy's father,
I refuse to press charges.

1468
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:37,517
Oh, God. Corinne, I'm sorry.

1469
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:40,186
Six years ago, Joe Carter...

1470
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:41,563
Joe Carter?

1471
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:44,065
Toronto and the Phillies.
World Series.

1472
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:46,859
Mitch Williams...
We flew up for the night.

1473
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:51,322
- There was a girl.
- Oh, God.

1474
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,992
I'm an idiot. I was so hammered.

1475
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,370
Chicken wings, Molson 3-0.
Canadian beer is like moonshine.

1476
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,705
Hell, yes.

1477
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:01,332
You remember?
It was at that Toronto Hooters.

1478
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:07,839
That was before he met you.
That Hooters thing is a coincidence.

1479
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:09,549
I'm sorry, Corinne.

1480
01:22:09,717 --> 01:22:13,720
I know this changes everything,
but I had to do the right thing.

1481
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:17,181
Mr. Castellucci.

1482
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:21,311
Pending a blood test, I...

1483
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:22,520
Whatever.

1484
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:27,609
The court grants custody to Kevin
Gerrity, pending the DNA test results.

1485
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:35,617
I want you to be my dad, Sonny.

1486
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:37,869
I know. I do too, pal.

1487
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,206
But I'm not sure that can happen
exactly the way we want it.

1488
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:45,209
Because it seems you
already have a daddy.

1489
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:47,754
But I'll tell you what I can do.

1490
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:51,507
I can be your friend, no matter what.
All right?

1491
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:53,426
I'll always be your friend.

1492
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:56,429
I'll always be your family.
I'll always be around.

1493
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:58,348
I promise.

1494
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:00,433
The kid's good at tying his shoes.

1495
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:02,769
He's not great at it,
so work with him.

1496
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:05,688
- I'll teach him bunny ears.
- What's bunny ears?

1497
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:08,274
Make bunny ears,
cross and pull them through.

1498
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:12,028
I go with this loop, swoop
and pull thing. He likes that.

1499
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,073
- I don't know that.
- Go with the loop, swoop and pull.

1500
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:17,033
I swear to God it's working.

1501
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:18,451
All right.

1502
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:23,247
Go with the bunny ears thing.
You're his dad, right? I'm sorry.

1503
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,084
It's important, when you eat
at my restaurant...

1504
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:28,461
...you never order BLT.

1505
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:31,297
You must trust me.
Stay away from BLT, okay?

1506
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:32,632
Hey, guys.

1507
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,426
I'm gonna leave you
with your dad now, Julian.

1508
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:38,179
He's a good man.
I've known him my whole life.

1509
01:23:38,389 --> 01:23:41,265
So you two have fun
and I'll see you in the morning.

1510
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:42,684
All right?

1511
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:46,104
- Quit scaring the kid for a minute.
- Who am I scaring?

1512
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:47,814
Bye, pal.

1513
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:51,776
Hey, Julian.

1514
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,946
I went to China.
Do you know where that is?

1515
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,698
It's in Asia, which is...

1516
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:59,617
...by Europe.
I brought some cool stuff back.

1517
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:06,332
Did you move the bench?

1518
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,418
That's pretty funny.

1519
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:12,797
You know what I got?
Some noisemakers. Check this out.

1520
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:15,341
Wanna try one?

1521
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:22,515
That's my foot!

1522
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:46,998
You're nice man.

1523
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:50,626
I've got Spice Channel.
It's blurry but it's nice.

1524
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:55,381
Let's make this quick.
I gotta get to work.

1525
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:58,342
Holy shit. Sonny Koufax
would rather work than eat.

1526
01:24:58,552 --> 01:25:02,847
I'm working on a big case. I gotta
sue you for making me come here.

1527
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:07,894
Surprise!

1528
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:13,399
Did you just waste
the good surprise on me again?

1529
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:16,819
Hi, Corinne.

1530
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:19,322
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, everybody.

1531
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,282
Hey, you guys. How are you?

1532
01:25:21,492 --> 01:25:23,367
Happy birthday, Daddy.

1533
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:26,162
How you doing, cutie?

1534
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:29,081
Sonny, I beat you so bad
in basketball yesterday.

1535
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:32,001
From now on, I have to
stop letting you win.

1536
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:34,295
I stopped that months ago.
He still wins.

1537
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:36,339
That's because you suck.

1538
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:40,009
Corinne, put a tank top on
for old time's sake.

1539
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:42,929
- What is he talking about, Mommy?
- Nothing.

1540
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:47,099
- Happy birthday, Sonny.
- Thank you.

1541
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:48,392
It's a clock radio.

1542
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:50,937
- Thanks for telling me.
- I have to split.

1543
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:52,271
I got deliveries.

1544
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:54,440
Hang out with us. We'll have fun.

1545
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:57,735
No, I can't stay.
I'll hang for a little bit.

1546
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:00,404
There you go. Come on,
let's eat, everybody.

1547
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:02,949
Hey, you! Still missing
that tooth, huh?

1548
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:04,408
Can we get some fries?

1549
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:08,746
- Vanessa.
- Hi, Sonny.

1550
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:10,331
You're a Hooters girl?

1551
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:13,042
What happened
to Sid's five-year plan?

1552
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:20,049
How you doing?

1553
01:26:20,717 --> 01:26:24,637
- Maybe it's a 10-year plan.
- Is that the guy with the old balls?

1554
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:25,888
I think it is.

1555
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:29,100
Come on. I bet they're nice.

1556
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:35,273
You're not supposed to say "balls."
Testicles. Okay?

1557
01:26:36,305 --> 01:27:36,484
