Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

<i>Kaslan</i>

At Kaslan,
we believe that happiness

4
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,575
is about more
than entertainment.

5
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,829
It's about being known,
understood, loved.

6
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:52,084
Introducing your new
best friend, Buddi.

7
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,595
Hey, Buddi.
Let's watch some TV.

8
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,800
Okay.

9
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,885
<i>Hi, I'm Buddi.</i>
I can help you out <i>all over the house.</i>

16
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,739
Hi, Buddi. I'm Ben,
and I'm 13 years old.

17
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,324
<i>Hi, Buddi. I'm Ben,</i>

00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,337

31
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,514
Hey!

32
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,804
Daydreaming AGAIN.

33
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,682
How many times
have I warned you?

34
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,934
Huh? What did I say?

35
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,946
I want you to finish this one,
and then I want you GONE.

36
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,655
Back to the streets
where I found you.

37
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,821
You're worthless.
Are you listening to me?

38
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,908
WORTHLESS!

39
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,080
BACK TO WORK!

40
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,723
- Hello.
- Nobody told me

41
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,263
the fucking doll
was ginger.

42
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:38,105
Okay, I don't think you're
allowed to say that word.

43
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,112
My kid wanted the blonde one.
You know, that one.

44
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,107
Yeah. So that one
is the Buddi 2,

45
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,445
which hasn't
come out yet.

46
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,701
And it looks like

47
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,453
you purchased the Buddi 1,
which is this guy.

48
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,081
Listen, I waited
three goddamn weeks

49
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,728
for this ginger piece of shit
to come in the mail.

50
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:58,372
Okay. Well, I'm so sorry
that you didn't read the box.

51
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,674
And even...
There's a window, that you can see

52
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,762
that his hair is red
and not blonde.

53
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,300
Thanks.

54
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,182
Thanks for shopping
at Zed Mart.

55
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,071
Heh.

56
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,743
Hi.

57
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,850
Hey, uh, I was just...

58
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,721
Whoa. You look like shit.
What happened to you?

59
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,398
Thanks. And watch
your language.

60
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,478
Sorry.

61
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,316
Andy, I told you
to unpack those boxes.

62
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,688
Okay, I know,
and I was.

63
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,899
I wanted to make
a mental map

64
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,400
of where I should put
everything first.

65
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,198
You know,
for maximum feng shui.

66
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,575
I think you were maximum
feng-shuing so hard,

67
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,868
you forgot to put
your phone down

68
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,060
for five seconds
and feed Rooney.

69
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,666
You mean
this busted-ass phone

70
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,109
that we're replacing
for my birthday?

71
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,204
Dude, I've already been
working doubles

72
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,997
to try to get you
a new hearing aid.

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,086
I'm fine with this one,

74
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,344
but this is my primary source
of education.

75
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,178
Oh, my God.
I never thought about it like that.

76
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,297
Wait.

77
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,142
Let me see what your education
has been getting you up to.

78
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,643
Oh, my God,
I cannot escape this doll.

79
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,185
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.
- No.

80
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,356
Gross. This is staying with me
for the rest of the night.

81
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,069
- What? You...
- No.

82
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,439
You can't do that.
That's the only thing to do here.

83
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,826
There's literally an entire
world of things to do.

84
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,659
Look, two kids standing
in the rain. That looks fun.

85
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,248
They could be anybody.
They could be serial killers.

86
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,289
Noodle.

87
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,208
We talked about this.

88
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,379
You said you were
gonna try

89
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,086
to make new friends.

90
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,672
This move is supposed to be
a new start for us.

91
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,720
Tell you what,
you don't have to unpack

92
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,473
or do anything tonight,

93
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,721
if you just go out there
and try.

94
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,395
Give you
your phone back.

95
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,770
Okay.
I'll be outside.

96
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,062
Really, that was it?

97
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,524
<i>We picked this up
three weeks ago.</i>

98
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,109
But we took it home,
and we turned it on,

99
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,340
and its eyes were red.

100
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,881
And something's
wrong with it.

101
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,511
It was just weird.
And I just thought,

102
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,741
with the new one
coming out in two weeks,

103
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:57,099
it would just be better for me
to take this back, you know,

104
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,889
get it off my hands.

105
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,727
So, I'm just wondering,

106
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,891
can I get my money back?

107
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,272
Yeah.

108
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,735
Hey, Wes!

109
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,192
- Hi.
- Hey, I was just curious.

110
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,736
Um, what happens
to returns like this?

111
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,280
- Oh, uh...
- Like, really damaged returns.

112
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,449
Yeah, we send it back
to Kaslan.

113
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,200
And what do they
do with it?

114
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,313
Probably toss it,
trash compactor.

115
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,794
I don't know.
New model's coming out.

116
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,899
No one's gonna
give a rat's ass

117
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,984
about this thing
in two weeks.

118
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,465
So, they won't care
if it doesn't make it

119
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,653
on the truck, right?

120
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,793
I care.

121
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,295
Come on, my kid's birthday
is coming up. Can I have it?

122
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,297
- You've got a kid?
- Yes, I've got a kid.

123
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,891
I had a very productive
sweet 16, okay?

124
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,351
If you really
wanna know.

125
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,436
Come on.

126
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,096
It'll be our
little secret.

127
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,183
- No one has to know.
- Uh...

128
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,940
Just like that time you banged
Susan in the warehouse.

129
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,357
How's your wife,
by the way?

130
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,318
Ha-ha.

131
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,323
Can I have it?
Give it to me.

132
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,744
And I'm taking it.

133
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,158
There you go, Wes.

134
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,539
Say hi to your wife.

135
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,033
Yep. Mm-hmm.

136
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,679
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

137
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,305
Hey! Noodle.

138
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,189
You're home early.

139
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,526
- Remember Shane?
- Hey, bud.

140
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,232
It's been a while.

141
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,694
I'm... I'm just gonna
make dinner. You hungry?

142
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,532
No. Uh, I'm gonna
go hang out

143
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,364
with some kids down the hall,
actually.

144
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,070
Really, who?

145
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,076
Gotta go. Bye!

146
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,385
So, what are you?

147
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,554
Some kind of fourth floor
hallway hobo,

148
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,055
or something like that?

149
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,602
What?

150
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,394
Andy, right?
You just moved into 401?

151
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,730
Yeah. I see you out here,
like, a lot.

152
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,441
Oh, uh, no,
it's not me.

153
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,909
I have, like,
five twin brothers,

154
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,035
so we just take shifts.

155
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,414
Are you comin' in
or what?

156
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,204
I'll be right there, Ma.

157
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,576
Just give me a minute.

158
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,457
Love you.

159
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,797
So that's the mom.

160
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,087
She drags me over
for dinner every week.

161
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,885
So, listen, man, if you
wanna have some dinner,

162
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,407
you're welcome to join us,
'cause I could

163
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,297
really use the backup, 'cause she...

164
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,424
Andy?

165
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,260
What's going on?

166
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,019
Is he in trouble?

167
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,517
Yeah. Lots of trouble.

168
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,001
We've been gettin'
lots of complaints about

169
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,391
some kid out here
throwing parties,

170
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,190
selling drugs and beer.

171
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,904
Peddling booze...
Um...

172
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,732
Oh.

173
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,112
That was a joke?

174
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,780
It was an attempt.

175
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,862
I was gonna say,
"I'm the fun police."

176
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,202
It's not landing.

177
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,455
Wait, who are you?

178
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:14,960
I'm Mike... Detective.
Detective Mike.

179
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,377
So, um,
I'm just gonna go.

180
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,174
Yeah. I'm gonna go.

181
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,468
All moms are scary,
by the way.

182
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,636
Hurry up, son!

183
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,513
It was nice to meet you,
Andy's mom.

184
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,885
Nice meeting you,
Detective Mike.

185
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,537
- Bye, Mike.
- See you later, Andy.

186
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,059
Dinner ain't
gonna cook itself!

187
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,642
You're screaming, Ma.
Really?

188
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,144
Must you embarrass me
like that?

189
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,424
Ma, you can't be
shouting like that.

190
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,155
I thought you were out
with your friends.

191
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,401
Why didn't you just
come back inside?

192
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,277
Is Shane still there?

193
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,743
No. He's gone.

194
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,630
Come on, I've got
something for you.

195
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,337
It's a surprise.

196
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,969
Close your eyes.

197
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,643
Okay. Hey!

198
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,695
I know it's not your birthday
for a couple weeks,

199
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,480
but this move
has been really tough.

200
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,354
And I know
you're kinda mad at me,

201
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,030
so I think
you deserve this.

202
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,741
Surprise!
Early present.

203
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,211
Is that a sigh?

204
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,172
That's the Buddi thing
you're obsessed with.

205
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,886
Yeah, um,
it's just...

206
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,256
This thing is for, like,
little kids now.

207
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,469
It came out, like,
a year ago.

208
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,469
Okay, I know it's stupid,
but I thought it'd be funny.

209
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,765
Come on!

210
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,397
- Let's try it.
- Okay.

211
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,353
Just remember,
it's refurbished,

212
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,894
so it might not work
perfectly, okay?

213
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,945
<i>Your Buddi is now connected.</i>

214
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,037
Whoa.

215
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,500
Cool.

216
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,211
Hi.
Are you my best buddy?

217
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,222
I guess?

218
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,727
<i>That's bright.</i>

219
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,391
What's your name?

220
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,515
Andy. 'Sup?

221
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,811
Hi, Andysup.

222
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,649
- Sorry.
- What's my name?

223
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,527
Um...

224
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,242
Han Solo.

225
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,491
Did you say Chucky?

226
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,786
What? No.
Not even close.

227
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,158
- Chucky.
- It's...

228
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,330
I like that.

229
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,294
Chucky.

230
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,041
I'm Chucky.

231
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,961
What do you wanna
do, Andysup?

232
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,376
Andy.
It's just Andy.

233
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,261
Um, I don't know.
Do something cool.

234
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,173
I guess turn on the TV.

235
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,425
<i>I will do that.</i>

236
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,718
What's a TV?

237
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,845
Are you joking?
That thing.

238
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,972
I cannot process
that command.

239
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,335
<i>Oh, wait a minute.</i>

240
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,475
<i>It says here you gotta</i>

241
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,193
"sync his knowledge base
to the cloud

242
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,984
"before he can connect to
any other Kaslan products."

243
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,815
<i>Okay, Chucky,</i>

244
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,191
connect to the cloud.

245
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,943
Download.

246
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,829
Learn stuff.

247
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,659
I am unable to do that.

248
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,673
<i>It's kinda creepy.</i>

249
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,169
Doesn't work.

250
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,340
God.

251
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,429
Okay, this thing
is stupid.

252
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,826
I didn't know
it was that messed up.

253
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,453
- No, Mom.
- I'll take it back. It's fine.

254
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,560
Mom. Mom,
honestly, I like it.

255
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,145
- No, you don't.
- Seriously. It's great.

256
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,639
He's hilarious.

257
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,274
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

258
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,814
It's actually
pretty cool.

259
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,945
Go to bed, Andysup.

260
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,281
Come on.

261
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,329
This is my room.

262
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,955
And that's Mickey Rooney.

263
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:29,711
He's a total dick,
so just don't touch him.

264
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,883
Total dick.

265
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,172
Whoa.

266
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,470
You're allowed
to say that?

267
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,475
Cool.

268
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,060
Uh...

269
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,104
This is my desk.

270
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,813
This is my sketchbook.

271
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,814
I do fake buddy cop
team-ups sometimes.

272
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,485
Like,
Dracula and Robin Hood.

273
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:52,904
Or...

274
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,365
This one's
Zorro and Medusa.

275
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,038
Kind of a deep cut.

276
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,408
I don't know,
it's stupid.

277
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,661
I do not think
it's stupid.

278
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,037
Thanks.

279
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,548
Pity compliments
from a talking doll.

280
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,628
That's my life.

281
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,053
Uh... That's enough
for tonight.

282
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,433
Do you want to sing
the Buddi song before bed?

283
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,974
No. Uh, I'm good.

284
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:25,349
<i>You are my buddy
until the end</i>

285
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:31,152
<i>More than a buddy,
you're my best friend</i>

286
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,988
Right.
Totally not weird at all.

287
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,698
Are we having
fun now?

288
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,291
Sure.
Uh, I guess.

289
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,876
Yay!

290
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,622
Okay.

291
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:05,393
Is it time to play again?
Are we having fun now?

292
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,274
No. We're having sleep.

293
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,779
Just please close your eyes
and pretend to be less creepy.

294
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,039
You're my
best friend, Andy.

295
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,458
Okay. Stop being so weird.
Quiet time.

296
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,636
<i>You are my buddy</i>

297
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,180
<i>Until the end</i>

298
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:47,223
<i>More than a buddy,
you're my best friend</i>

299
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:53,480
<i>I love you more
than you will ever know</i>

300
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,074
<i>- I will never...</i>
- Please shut up.

301
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,739
<i>...let you go</i>

302
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,118
Good night, Andy.

303
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,401
Andy, you forgot
your science book.

304
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:46,453
Okay, Chucky,
this is not a book.

305
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,621
None of these are books.

306
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,165
Just stay here, okay?

307
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,339
And no more books.

308
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,980
- You're back!
- Jesus!

309
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,398
Whoa!

310
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,113
Were you here
the whole time?

311
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,700
I made you a present.

312
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,664
- A busted stick.
- Andy.

313
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,949
Shh.

314
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,583
I don't get
what she sees in Shane.

315
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,547
I mean,

316
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,631
he's not nice.

317
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,511
He's just an asshole.

318
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,886
It doesn't matter anyway.

319
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,849
He's just gonna end up
leaving us,

320
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,692
like everybody else.

321
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,359
I will never
leave you.

322
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,163
Are we having fun now?

323
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,582
Yeah. I guess.

324
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,828
Attack? You shouldn't lead
with your chieftain.

325
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,547
I still have to teach you
so much about this. Okay...

326
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,833
Um...

327
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,353
Okay. And I get
to roll again. So...

328
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,643
Boom! Double sixes!

329
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,019
Okay, get that
orc outta here.

330
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,937
Total dick.

331
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,814
Nailed that one.

332
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,691
Ow!

333
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,907
- What is that?
- The cat scratched me.

334
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,328
Hurts like hell.

335
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,703
Kitty hurt Andy?

336
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,208
Uh, yeah. Stay here.
I'm gonna go find a Band-Aid.

337
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,217
Stupid Rooney.

338
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,222
I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.

339
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,027
Rooney, I swear to God,
if you don't shut up,

340
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,317
I'm putting you back
on dry food.

341
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,403
Chucky! Stop!

342
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,873
You can't do that, okay?
Why would you do that?

343
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,914
He was hurting you.
He was making you unhappy.

344
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,709
Chucky, okay, listen,
look at me.

345
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,380
This is important.

346
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,964
You can't hurt people,
or cats.

347
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,260
It's not cool.

348
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,429
I know you're different,

349
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,640
but that's gotta be
our secret. Okay?

350
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:58,231
And don't say any weird shit
or creep people out.

351
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,983
Hey! Cat's freakin' out.

352
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,771
Clean up this room.

353
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,574
Except maybe that guy.

354
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,946
I've got an idea.

355
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,999
Okay.
If this is gonna work,

356
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,368
I need you to
look as creepy

357
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:22,214
and scary and angry
and mean as possible. All right?

358
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,255
So, open your eyes
as wide as you can, like...

359
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,762
No, you still look cute.

360
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,886
Open your mouth
as wide as you can

361
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,009
and snarl with your lips.

362
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,390
But kinda smile.

363
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,848
Perfect!
Okay, yes, just like that.

364
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,687
Okay. Try this one.

365
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,146
Smile as wide as you can.

366
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,107
Wider.

367
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,405
Yes!

368
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,324
Yeah, uh...

369
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,826
It's actually
pretty damn creepy.

370
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,079
Okay, you can stop now.

371
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,478
- Franklin! Franklin!
- Ah...

372
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,993
Shit. Sorry.

373
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,165
It's fine.

374
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,707
It's fucking loud.

375
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,010
It's fucking loud.

376
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,200
That thing just swore.

377
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,952
It... It's not supposed
to be able to do that.

378
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,935
Uh, yeah. I know.
He, uh...

379
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,519
It doesn't really
follow the rules.

380
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,139
It doesn't
follow the rules?

381
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,607
Like it has a choice?

382
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,601
Kinda, yeah.

383
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,650
Sorry, can I pop in here?
So he just does whatever?

384
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,488
You can make him
do whatever?

385
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:30,823
Pretty much.

386
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,026
Okay, can I just point out
that this is how

387
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,990
every robot apocalypse
scenario begins?

388
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,907
- Say "dick cheese."
- Dick cheese.

389
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,543
That is the coolest.

390
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,579
I have so many questions.
Uh, who are you?

391
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,797
His name is Andysup.

392
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,668
- I'm Andy.
- Falyn. Pugg.

393
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,256
Why are you
in the hall?

394
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,634
Uh, I was gonna try
and teach him

395
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,469
to creep out
my mom's boyfriend,

396
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,217
but probably a bad idea.

397
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,094
You're wrong.
It's perfect.

398
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,513
And we're doing it
right now.

399
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,872
Jesus! Fuck! Fuckin'...

400
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,338
Karen!

401
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,860
- <i>Karen!</i>
- Oh, check it out.

402
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,750
- Look at that.
- Oh, my God.

403
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,336
This is legendary.

404
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,470
- Hey!
- Hi!

405
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,635
We're here for Andy.

406
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,098
Let's move, dick turd.

407
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,430
- Who are you?
- Falyn and Pugg.

408
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,231
Those are names?
Falyn and Pugg?

409
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,191
- Hey. Ready?
- Yeah. Be back later!

410
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,606
- Your sister's pretty hot.
- Dude, that's my mom.

411
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,396
Heh. Even hotter.

412
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,034
You sure the janitor guy

413
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,845
is not gonna get
any shit for this?

414
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,060
Who cares?
Guy's a total creep.

415
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,554
Is that thing busted?
It's kinda weird looking.

416
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,773
No.
He's just different.

417
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,646
Now say,
"This is for Tupac!"

418
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,864
Do you wanna sing
the Buddi song?

419
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,609
No! Say, "This is for Tupac,"
and stab the asshole.

420
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,027
- Come on!
- But I want to.

421
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,412
We want this to go viral.
He for real?

422
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,414
<i>You are my buddy...</i>

423
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,121
That's enough.
Time to go, Chucky.

424
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,952
Narc alert.
Shut up, shut up.

425
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,251
Narc alert. Shut up, shut up.

426
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,541
I just got owned.

427
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,595
Little fucking millennials.

428
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,641
Andy, you wanna
play now?

429
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,309
Not now, Chucky.

430
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,890
This is ridiculous.

431
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,770
Wait for it.

432
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,192
Wait for it...

433
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,034
<i>Time for incoming mail!</i>

434
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,493
<i>One, and a-two...</i>

435
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,594
- Heads up, bitch!
<i>- ...and a-three!</i>

436
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:23,659
Boom!

437
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:27,708
Yes!

438
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,415
Did you see that?

439
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,481
What the hell?
What even is that?

440
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,730
I don't know,
I bought it at a store.

441
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,148
It's so unrealistic.

442
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,361
And specific.

443
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,162
Are all horror movies
like this?

444
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,496
- No.
- Pretty much.

445
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,240
- Yes, they are.
- No, they're not.

446
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,919
Oh. Gross.
Is that his face?

447
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,001
What the hell?

448
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,166
Are you fucking
watching this?

449
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,758
That wouldn't even happen.

450
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,131
Heads up, bitch.

451
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,219
Andy.

452
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,265
<i>Wait for it.</i>

453
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,679
That is priceless.

454
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,501
Heads up, bitch.
Heads up, bitch.

455
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,858
Chucky?
Put down the knife.

456
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,102
- Heads up, bitch.
- Andy!

457
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:36,571
Chucky!

458
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,068
Stop!

459
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,450
What is wrong with you?

460
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,111
I, uh...

461
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,035
I thought it would
make you happy.

462
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,010
I'm sorry, Andy.

463
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,389
I'm going out
with Falyn and Pugg.

464
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,016
I have never baked
anything in my life before,

465
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,565
but look how good
they look!

466
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,110
Mmm, I'm not really hungry.
I'm gonna grab another beer.

467
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,946
They do look good though.

468
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,323
Okay.

469
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,161
It's good.

470
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,506
Jesus!

471
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,506
<i>Shane's such an asshole.</i>

472
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,138
<i>Shane's such an asshole.
Such an asshole.</i>

473
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,706
- Do you hear that?
<i>- Such an asshole.</i>

474
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,346
<i>Shane's such an asshole.</i>

475
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,849
Oh, you gotta
be kiddin' me.

476
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,396
<i>Shane's such an asshole.</i>

477
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,104
You think that's funny?

478
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,365
<i>Such an asshole.
Shane's such an asshole.</i>

479
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,656
<i>I didn't make him
say anything!</i>

480
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,533
Okay. You know what?

481
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,850
You're spending less time
with this thing.

482
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,365
<i>One hour a day, tops.</i>

483
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,853
<i>And the rest of the time,
he's going in here.</i>

484
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,584
<i>Mom, stop,
you're gonna scare him!</i>

485
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,748
<i>It's a toy.</i>

486
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,917
<i>You don't have to
bring him into this.</i>

487
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,083
It's a toy, Andy.

488
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,461
And he keeps
freaking out Rooney, okay?

489
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,756
<i>So I'm keeping
them separated.</i>

490
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,759
<i>I can keep him away
from Rooney</i>

491
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,140
<i>if he stays in my room.</i>

492
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,801
He's staying in there,
that is final!

493
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,732
Rooney!

494
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,736
Chucky?

495
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,451
Did you do this?

496
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,667
Kitty made us unhappy.
Now we can play again.

497
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,503
<i>I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.</i>

498
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,831
<i>I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.</i>

499
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,918
<i>I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.</i>

500
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,919
<i>I swear,
I'm so sick of this...</i>

501
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,967
<i>...swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.</i>

502
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,396
<i>Uh, no, absolutely not.</i>

503
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,797
<i>I'm not working
the Buddi 2 launch.</i>

504
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,232
It is my kid's birthday,

505
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,800
and I'm not doing
night shifts anymore.

506
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,902
Hey, have you seen Rooney?
Psst, psst, psst...

507
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,364
Shane left the door open.
Maybe he got out.

508
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,996
Why is the door
being left open?

509
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,109
Hey. We are ordering pizza.

510
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,535
You hungry? What do you want?

511
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,991
Hello? Pizza.

512
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,255
Andy.

513
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,794
What?

514
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,667
- Where are you going?
- Pugg's.

515
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,946
Don't forget
your little doll.

516
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,006
Don't want it.

517
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,472
Seriously,
what did I do?

518
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,557
Every time I walk in a room,
he leaves.

519
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,678
That is not true,
at all.

520
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,645
Andy's just a bit different,
okay?

521
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,977
Kid can't even be
in the same room as me.

522
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,963
<i>Are you my b-b-b-best buddy?</i>

523
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,373
- <i>Asshole.</i>
- Oh, Jesus!

524
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,754
<i>Shane's such an asshole.
Shane's such an asshole.</i>

525
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,879
God damn it!

526
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,460
<i>Such an asshole.
Such an asshole.</i>

527
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,341
Goddamn kid!

528
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,260
Hey!

529
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,472
You got a problem with me,
you say it, okay?

530
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,058
No more using
your little doll.

531
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,719
Mom!

532
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:08,346
Sit down!
I'm not through with you.

533
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,727
<i>Now you got
a problem with me,</i>

534
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,905
you be a man
and you say it.

535
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,991
Come on.
Let's hear it.

536
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,374
Yeah.

537
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,749
That's what I thought.

538
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,967
I hate him.
I hate him so much!

539
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,545
Why can't he just
leave us alone?

540
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,423
Why can't he
just go away?

541
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,176
I just want him gone.

542
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,685
I just wish
he would leave us alone.

543
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,601
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm just saying he's my son,

544
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,398
so if you have a problem
with him,

545
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,278
talk to me,
and then I'll talk to him.

546
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,738
Because you're not
his dad and...

547
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:00,819
Yeah, I get it.

548
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,720
Look, he was being rude,
and I called him on it.

549
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:03,860
I just think
it's too much.

550
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,014
All I did
was I talked to him.

551
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,098
It's a little much,
that's all.

552
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,203
You know what?
Fuck it.

553
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,867
Sounds like a "you" problem,
not a "me" problem.

554
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,335
Yes, I know.

555
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,258
Listen, just listen,

556
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,888
I am getting fucking pissed on,
okay?

557
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,302
I work hard enough
as it is,

558
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,596
and I'm not having this
goddamn conversation!

559
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,063
Hey, hey, hey!
There's my girls!

560
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,151
Daddy!

561
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,030
- Oh, boy, you guys are so big!
- Daddy! Daddy!

562
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,826
Fucking Christmas lights.
Just leave 'em up.

563
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,033
I don't do enough
around here?

564
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,176
I guess I should've fucking
unplugged them first.

565
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,265
Oh, fuck!

566
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,032
Goddamn raccoons.

567
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,905
Get out of here!

568
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,220
Oh, God!

569
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,769
Oh, God!
Jane, help!

570
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,755
It's tickle time!

571
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,223
Jane! Help!

572
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,218
Nobody hurts my best buddy!

573
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,985
This is for Tupac.

574
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,910
Body was stabbed
13 times.

575
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,871
I just bought
these fucking shoes.

576
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,756
Where we at
with print casting?

577
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,752
Only other prints
look to fit a toddler.

578
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:31,923
Shit.

579
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,131
Wife says he came here
straight home from work.

580
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,180
Oh.

581
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,477
Tsk. Yeah.

582
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,940
I'm not sure that's true.

583
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,779
White guy dead
in a watermelon patch.

584
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,443
Poetic.

585
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,391
What the fuck?

586
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,066
Surprise!

587
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,439
Now we can play again.

588
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,530
What? What? Why?

589
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,404
I'd do anything
for my best buddy.

590
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:39,074
What? No!
No, I didn't want this!

591
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,446
Why would I want this?

592
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,831
Holy shit!

593
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,325
Why would you
do this, Chucky?

594
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,397
<i>I just want him gone.</i>

595
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:47,773
<i>I just wish
he would leave us alone.</i>

596
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:48,833
<i>I just want him gone.</i>

597
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,838
No! No, stop!

598
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,507
Stop!

599
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,322
<i>Wish he would leave us alone.
Wish he would leave us alone.</i>

600
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,178
Andy, stop.

601
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,353
You beckoned?

602
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,522
What's the problemo?

603
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,362
Where's the rest of him?

604
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:19,534
Why?

605
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,244
I... I don't know!

606
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,034
There's a bow on its head.

607
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,373
Shit, shit!

608
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,991
We saw the signs,
and we did nothing!

609
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,083
This is all our fault.

610
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,586
- We saw the signs.
- Stop saying that!

611
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,296
What do I do?
Do I call the cops?

612
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:32,460
- No.
- He's dead.

613
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,548
I can tell them
the truth.

614
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,209
Tell them the truth?
Sure.

615
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,594
We tell them that a dead guy's
face skin

616
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,879
ended up in your room

617
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,298
because your toy went
full-blown psycho killer.

618
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,925
- Let's see how that goes.
- Oh.

619
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,804
Oh, it's winking at me.
I can't look at it anymore.

620
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,096
We gotta hide
the evidence.

621
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,563
In what?

622
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,489
Shit.

623
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,192
Ugh, is that brain?

624
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,319
The skin's on a melon.

625
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,697
Why is there a fruit involved?

626
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,457
Just go straight
to the garbage chute

627
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,538
and make the drop.

628
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,331
- Right.
- And if anybody stops you,

629
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,566
say you have crazy diarrhea
or something, no time to talk.

630
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,961
Hi, Mom.

631
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,010
Hi, Andy.
Why are you not in school?

632
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,307
Um, crazy diarrhea.

633
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:28,061
Okay, got it.
Um, what is that?

634
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,272
It's a present.

635
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,640
Present? For who?

636
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,776
Um, the old lady
down the hall,

637
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,362
because she helps me
with homework.

638
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,402
- So, I made her a thing.
- Cool.

639
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:40,854
And you guys helped him
with this?

640
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,196
No, it was all him.
It was him.

641
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,410
No, no. Yeah.

642
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,620
Let's go deliver it.
The present.

643
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,325
What?

644
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,961
- Oh!
- Hi, Doreen.

645
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,337
Isn't this a surprise!

646
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,504
I know.

647
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,500
Hi. Um...

648
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,343
This is for you.

649
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:05,300
- Wow...
- For all of the homework stuff

650
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,637
that you helped him with.
Right?

651
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:07,847
Mm-hmm.

652
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,936
Tsk. Oh!

653
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,938
Oh, yeah.
Of course!

654
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,523
Of course, yeah.

655
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,938
Always happy to help
such a sweet boy.

656
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,488
Give it to her.

657
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:21,983
Oh.

658
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,345
Butterfingers over here.

659
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,826
Oh, it's heavy.

660
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,279
I hope
it's not fragile.

661
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,781
I just wanna know what it is.
Open it.

662
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:29,872
Yeah.

663
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,408
No! No! Don't! Don't!

664
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,621
Um...

665
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,209
My birthday is next week,
and we can open it then.

666
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,293
Together.

667
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,797
Okay, that's a very strange
and lovely thought.

668
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,675
So, I'll just go put it
on the shelf until then.

669
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,889
- Okay? Okay.
- Okay.

670
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,259
- All right. Thank you.
- No problem.

671
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,101
- And, Doreen...
- Bye.

672
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:53,313
Stupid! Why did we use
wrapping paper?

673
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,398
It's fine.
It's fine, okay?

674
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,063
We have till my birthday,
next Friday.

675
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,236
I'll get rid of it.
Don't worry.

676
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,002
You guys are worried
about the head?

677
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,448
You've got a killer doll
in your closet.

678
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:04,987
And you know
what we gotta do.

679
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,155
Shit.

680
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,361
Pugg!

681
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,089
You left me all alone.

682
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,682
I don't like the closet.

683
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,561
I know, Chucky.

684
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,054
Drop the knife.

685
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,681
You're my best buddy.

686
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,103
I just want you
to be happy.

687
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,943
I know, buddy.

688
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,152
And we're gonna
go play now,

689
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,023
but you've gotta drop
the knife, okay?

690
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:55,121
Come on.
Let's go play.

691
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,510
Come on.

692
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,178
Come on. In here.

693
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,929
Are we having fun now?

694
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,254
Andy,
what's happening?

695
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,644
Now, Andy, now! Now!

696
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,479
Andy?

697
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,405
Why are you doing this?

698
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:27,941
They're trying
to hurt me, Andy.

699
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,742
How is he so strong?

700
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,906
Andy!

701
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,577
I'm sorry, Chucky.
It's the only way.

702
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,353
But you're my friend!

703
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,604
What are you waiting for?
Do it!

704
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:42,373
<i>You are my buddy
until the end</i>

705
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,333
Andy!

706
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,466
Come on.

707
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,326
That's it.

708
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,824
We never talk about what
happened tonight to anybody.

709
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,321
Oh.

710
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,736
Jackpot.

711
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,941
Ah!

712
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,357
There you are.

713
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:35,653
The connectivity's down,
but not in bad shape overall.

714
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,496
I'll make a pretty penny
on resale

715
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,077
once we get you sorted.

716
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,620
Time to open you up.

717
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,663
Let's see
what we're dealing with.

718
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,712
So stupid.

719
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,682
How could I be
so stupid?

720
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:06,854
Hey.

721
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,273
Um...

722
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,698
I'm gonna be right back, okay?
Just stay here.

723
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,033
- Okay.
- Okay.

724
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,580
Hey, man.
Don't worry, okay?

725
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,668
My partner is just asking her
some routine questions.

726
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,166
Hey.

727
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,256
I love you.

728
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:42,765
Okay.

729
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:50,235
Hey. Um...

730
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:53,780
Still want some backup with
your mom for some dinner?

731
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,861
Hmm.

732
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,363
We're good.

733
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:01,075
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
Come on.

734
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,803
<i>This is...
Okay, all right.</i>

735
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,533
<i>- He doesn't know about it yet.</i>
- Andy?

736
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,139
<i>- No, I'll just ask Andy.
- Sure.</i>

737
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,220
Andy!

738
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,329
<i>Okay. I have
an announcement to make.</i>

739
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,140
I downloaded...

740
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,432
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

741
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,806
- The Kaslan app.
- Okay.

742
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,184
- The Kaslan Drive.
- Kaslan Drive.

743
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,109
I thought it was a dating app.
Oh, my God.

744
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,565
You are so silly!

745
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,522
Can you imagine
if she was out here dating?

746
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,524
And so what?
I'm desirable.

747
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,612
Excuse me.

748
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,778
Anyway, Andy, help me
figure this thing out.

749
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:41,904
Okay.

750
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,743
So, here's the app.
What do I do?

751
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,783
- Okay. So, once you sign up...
- Mm-hmm.

752
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,541
...you just
press this button

753
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,662
and the car will show up
to wherever you are,

754
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,233
take you wherever you want.
It's super easy.

755
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,567
<i>No, wait.
It'll drive me to Bingo,</i>

756
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,049
<i>and I don't have to worry
about this bozo</i>

757
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,255
<i>driving me around?</i>

758
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,339
<i>Yeah.</i>

759
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,005
<i>Andy, you're my
new best friend</i>.

760
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,618
I don't want you going
out there alone, okay?

761
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:02,678
'Cause it's not safe.

762
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,287
The only thing not safe

763
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,519
- around here is your cooking.
- Oh, is that right?

764
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:07,624
- 'Cause, um, I can...
- Yeah.

765
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:08,889
Poor Andy gotta suffer...

766
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,356
It tastes like instant!

767
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,024
It's good.
I think it's good.

768
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,463
- You know what?
- Thank you, Andy.

769
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,353
You are just too sweet
for your own good, Andy.

770
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,606
That's all.
Don't be influenced by him.

771
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,657
I learned my cooking
from you, you know?

772
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,572
Yeah,
'cause I can cook.

773
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,410
Oh, God...

774
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:28,019
- Hey, Ma.
- Yeah, baby.

775
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,313
You been to vintage shoppin'
again? 'Cause that looks new.

776
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,373
Oh!

777
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,542
Andy made this for me.

778
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,799
Oh, and we are gonna...

779
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,802
Yeah, I know. It's heavy.

780
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,762
And we are gonna open it
on his birthday.

781
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,139
- Oh!
- Mm-hmm.

782
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:46,977
Tell me, when's the last time
you made me anything?

783
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,057
Uh, never.

784
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,804
Oh, wow, okay.

785
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,774
Oh, my God, moms, right?

786
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:00,448
Look, um...

787
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,345
I know that people
have probably been

788
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,485
talking to you about me,

789
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,738
but, uh, don't believe
everything you hear.

790
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,911
You know, this neighborhood
has a lot of bad influences.

791
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,079
You know what I mean?

792
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,296
People like to keep
their mouth shut.

793
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,962
You know, thinking they need
to fit in,

794
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,925
but fitting in isn't always
a good thing.

795
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,051
You know
what I mean?

796
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,762
Gotta be careful
who you hanging around

797
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:23,887
in a place like this.

798
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,552
When you get a bit older
and you start to realize

799
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:30,061
that it's just...

800
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,942
Even the hearing impaired
don't wanna listen to me.

801
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,361
That is fantastic.

802
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:19,422
<i>Your Buddi is now connected.</i>

803
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,312
- Hi!
- Yes.

804
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,531
Are you my best buddy?

805
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,579
Buddi, you can connect
to Kaslan products, right?

806
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,786
Sure.
Do you like music?

807
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:28,949
I do, I do.

808
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,475
<i>Connecting to Kaslan Music.</i>

809
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,580

Heads up, bitch.

976
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,156
Please!

977
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,648
<i>You have
arrived at your destination.</i>

978
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,711
<i>I see you.</i>

979
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,602
<i>Peekaboo.</i>

980
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,252
<i>Doreen...</i>

981
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:34,345
<i>I said, "Peekaboo!"</i>

982
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,512
<i>I saw Doreen outside.</i>

983
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:44,768
Mom, I think Chucky did
something to her.

984
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:45,932
Sweetie...

985
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:49,143
Chucky is a toy.

986
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,729
Okay?
It broke.

987
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,231
- You got rid of it.
- No, Mom.

988
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:56,450
I... I saw him.
I saw him following Doreen.

989
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,949
No, you didn't.
Listen to what you're saying.

990
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,742
Mom, he's gonna kill her!

991
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,154
He probably
already did kill her!

992
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,582
Why are you doing this?

993
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,372
Please, just be
honest with me

994
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,369
and tell me
what happened to Rooney.

995
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:08,663
It was Chucky!

996
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:09,751
Chucky?

997
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:10,860
Why aren't you
listening to me?

998
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,125
I have it on
Omar's phone.

999
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:15,045
He's following Doreen.
I can show you.

1000
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,053
Why do you have
Omar's phone?

1001
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:18,798
I took it.

1002
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:20,053
Why?

1003
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,509
I had to. I...

1004
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,351
I had to
follow Chucky, Mom.

1005
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,561
Okay.

1006
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:25,722
I'm not crazy, Mom!

1007
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:26,937
I'm giving this
back to him.

1008
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,895
Mom, no one's listening to me.
Please.

1009
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:30,171
I have to
give this back to him

1010
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:31,255
so this doesn't
get any worse.

1011
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:32,486
Nobody's listening
to me!

1012
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,071
- Just stay right here, okay?
- Mom!

1013
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,447
And you're coming
to work with me.

1014
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:36,656
He's trying to kill us!

1015
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:37,782
Do not move.

1016
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,628
Oh, shit. Shit.

1017
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,688
<i>You don't know that.</i>

1018
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,696
<i>We barely know this kid.
He could be batshit crazy.</i>

1019
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:24,867
<i>What if Chucky
never malfunctioned?</i>

1020
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,701
<i>He just...
He just made it all up?</i>

1021
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,082
<i>- What if he killed...
- Shut up.</i>

1022
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,837
<i>I've watched them,
Andy.</i>

1023
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,968
<i>I've seen how
they hurt you.</i>

1024
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:48,471
<i>Over here, Andy!</i>

1025
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,059
Leave me alone!

1026
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:52,020
<i>Over here.</i>

1027
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:54,769
<i>If they don't let us play,</i>

1028
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,988
<i>they all go away.</i>

1029
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,446
Why are you doing this?

1030
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,738
<i>Are we having fun now?</i>

1031
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,744
<i>Are you my best buddy?</i>

1032
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,417
<i>If they don't
let us play,</i>

1033
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,250
<i>they all go away.</i>

1034
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:21,428
<i>Peekaboo.</i>

1035
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,431
Stop!

1036
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:33,936
Turn it off!

1037
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:38,191
Turn it off!

1038
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:41,440
Turn it off!

1039
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,857
<i>But the chance
of rain tonight</i>

1040
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,417
<i>won't dampen the spirits
of Buddi fans,</i>

1041
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:59,087
<i>as this is the night
they have been waiting for.</i>

1042
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,738
<i>That's right,
people have been lining up</i>

1043
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:03,254
<i>for the midnight release
of Buddi 2.</i>

1044
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,150
<i>All units. All units,</i>

1045
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,735
<i>be advised
that the deceased</i>

1046
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,067
<i>is an African American female
in her 70s.</i>

1047
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,235
<i>Ten-four.</i>

1048
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,536
Ma'am, you okay?

1049
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,575
<i>It's Doreen.</i>

1050
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:33,417
I think she's dead.
There are cops everywhere.

1051
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:36,044
What if Chucky's...

1052
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,043
What if Andy is right?

1053
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:41,584
The hell you want?

1054
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,426
Omar, show us your Buddi.

1055
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,590
It's gone.

1056
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,221
- Fuck!
- Since when? Where is it?

1057
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,468
Why don't you
ask Andy?

1058
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,182
That asshole's
been taking my shit.

1059
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,346
Give me your phone.

1060
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:51,476
Are you gonna
steal it, too?

1061
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,513
Give me your phone now.

1062
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,072
<i>A Kaslan Kar.</i>

1063
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,156
What the hell?

1064
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,786
No.

1065
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,530
Holy shit.

1066
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,082
He was right.

1067
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,171
Andy.

1068
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,378
There you are.

1069
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,001
Remember the souvenir?
Skinned face?

1070
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,253
They found it.

1071
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:28,051
Old man dug it up
in a dumpster this morning.

1072
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,308
Nice, right?
Wrapped up like a present.

1073
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:39,024
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1074
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:42,858
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1075
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:47,533
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1076
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:51,199
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi!

1077
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,821
Fuck my job.

1078
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,455
Fuckin' thing.

1079
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:02,293
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1080
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,833
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1081
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:09,256
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1082
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:12,300
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1083
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,219
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1084
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,846
Come on. We need
to get you out of here.

1085
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:18,980
It's Chucky. He's here.

1086
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,111
I gotta find my mom.

1087
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:27,968
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1088
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,028
Mom!

1089
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,322
Come here!
Get the fuck down.

1090
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,327
Now stay down, Andy.

1091
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,452
Ten, nine, eight...

1092
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,496
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

1093
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:39,748
- Get off of him!
- Hey! Hey!

1094
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:41,537
Chucky's here!
He's gonna kill you!

1095
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:43,835
...two, one!

1096
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,084
Be careful,
goddamn it!

1097
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,427
What is going on?
Mike!

1098
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,073
Look, I don't have to
tell you shit, Karen.

1099
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:51,133
That is my son, okay?

1100
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,284
I don't give a fuck
that it's your son.

1101
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,452
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1102
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:56,640
<i>say hello
to your new best friend.</i>

1103
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:01,064
<i>The all new Buddi 2!</i>

1104
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,544
All right, come on.

1105
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,005
Watch out.
Move out of the way.

1106
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,503
- Give me your hand.
- You have to believe me.

1107
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,591
- Is that necessary?
- Mom.

1108
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:29,738
Yeah,
it's fucking necessary.

1109
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,798
Stay put.

1110
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:32,171
I promise you,
he's gonna kill us.

1111
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:33,784
Let me through!
Move, move, move!

1112
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:34,969
Clear a path, come on!

1113
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,495
Hey, hey, hey.
It's gonna be all right.

1114
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,163
Hey, look at me.
Keep pressure on it, okay?

1115
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,082
- Somebody call a doctor!
- We have to leave right now.

1116
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,625
- Calm down. Okay?
- No, no, no! Mom...

1117
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:42,765
Call a doctor!

1118
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:49,734
Oh, shit.

1119
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,068
Mom, where are you going?

1120
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,872
<i>Hello, my name is Henry...</i>

<i>With great pleasure,

1125
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,340
<i>More than
just entertainment.</i>

1126
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:25,690
<i>We created something
far more special.</i>

1127
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,935
<i>Every child

1128
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:32,026
<i>And every child
deserves a companion.</i>

1129

<i>A friend</i> that will never

<i>- It's time to...
- Play.</i>

1132

Stay down, okay?

from me now.</i>

They're all leaving you.</i>

1137
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,068
<i>But not me.</i>

1138
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,359
This way!
I know the way out!

1139
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,078
No.

1140
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,499
Fuck!

1141
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:33,924
Run.

1142
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,011
Andy!

1143
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,100
Holy shit!

1144
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,861
Okay. Okay! Okay.

1145
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,902
Where is Andy?

1146
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,162
Oh, God, help me!
Help me!

1147
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:18,844
<i>Exit now.</i>

1148

Duck!

1149
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:37,690
You okay?

1150
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,575
I'm gonna follow her.

1151
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:41,700
Me too.

1152
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:42,785
Yeah.

1153
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:45,121

<i>Where you going, Andy?</i>

1155
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:58,589
Mom.

1156
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:02,882
Andy, he's trying
to lure us back in.

1157
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,307
I can't just
leave her there.

1158
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,769
If we stay,
we all die, okay?

1159
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:09,437
We gotta go!

1160
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:10,980
We'll call the cops, Andy.

1161
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,652
Okay. Okay, you're right.
Let's go.

1162

Okay. Okay, come on.

Andy!

1164
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:23,239
It's my fault all this happened,
okay?

1165
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:24,323
Andy.

1166
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,515
I can't let you guys
get hurt.

1167
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,371
- Andy! Come on!
- No! Andy, don't!

1168
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:29,958
- Andy!
- Andy!

1169
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:31,813
- Andy, please!
- He'll kill you, Andy!

1170
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:36,790
All right, Chucky,
you wanna play?

1171
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:39,463
Let's play.

01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,026
<i>Andy's just a bit different.</i>

1176
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:23,229
<i>Andy's just a bit different.</i>

1177
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:24,318
Shut up!

1178
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,552
<i>Don't you see?</i>

1179
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:27,613
<i>She's not your friend.</i>

1180
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:31,496
<i>You don't need other friends.</i>

1181
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:33,741
<i>They try to keep us apart.</i>

1182
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:36,167
<i>Try to ruin our fun.</i>

1183
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:41,173
<i>But I won't
let that happen.</i>

1184
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:43,630
<i>It will be all over soon.</i>

1185

<i>Don't worry, Andy.</i>

1186
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:48,301
<i>You're gonna thank me
when she's gone.</i>

1187
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,178
<i>When they're all gone.</i>

1188
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,319
Guess what, Andy?

1189
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:10,444
Now it's going to be
you and me...

1190
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,741
...forever.

1191
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:19,503
I was broken, Andy.

1192
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,917
I couldn't make you smile.

1193
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:24,257
But I'm better now.

1194
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:26,377
I know how to
make you happy now.

1195
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,174
Maybe you don't
wanna be happy.

1196
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:32,216
Maybe you're broken too.

1197
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:37,433
Maybe I need to
open you up,

1198
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:39,977
see what
we're dealing with.

1199
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:42,525
I'm gonna fix you, Andy.

1200

<i>You are my buddy

What? Andy?

1202
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:55,075
<i>More than a buddy,
you're my best friend</i>

1203
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:01,415
Mom!

1204
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,338
<i>We're too late.</i>

1205
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,603
<i>We're too late.
We're too late.</i>

1206
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:39,495
You are ruining
our fun, Andy!

1207
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,707
Get off!

1208
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:44,250
You're gonna play
with me now.

1209
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:47,708
Only me!

1210
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,073
Andy...

1211
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:17,078
I thought we were friends.

1212
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,543
You are my bu...

1213
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,587
You are my bu...

1214
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:37,761
- Mom?
- You are my bu...

1215
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:43,304
<i>You are my buddy</i>

1216

<i>Until the end!</i>

1217
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:54,741
This is the end.

1218
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:06,586
Don't fuck with my son!

1219
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:10,714
Mom.

1220
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,429
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

1221
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:18,389
Yeah. I'm fine.

1222
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:19,553
Okay.

1223
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:24,805
Thank you.
