2
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:31,216
He say, "Good morning,"
and ask, "How is your hand?"

3
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:34,886
It's -- It's better.

4
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:36,346
What's left of it.

5
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,809
Sorry.

6
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,854
We would like to speak with 
you if you feel well enough.

7
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:46,189
Yeah, that's all right.

8
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,777
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

9
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:57,075
Tell us about this place you mention,
in Slovakia.

10
00:03:58,327 --> 00:04:00,203
It's this ...

11
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,956
It's some kind of factory ...

12
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:06,001
where these people,
these very rich people ...

13
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:09,254
they pay to torture and kill kids.

14
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:11,506
Mostly backpackers.

15
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:16,595
And they killed two of my friends.

16
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,195
They take you from this hostel ...

17
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:37,908
and they bring you
to this factory and ...

18
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:42,287
I went there looking for Josh.

19
00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:46,917
He was one of my friends
and they took him there and ...

20
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:51,463
And they ...

21
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:52,631
They killed him.

22
00:04:56,302 --> 00:04:58,011
It was horrible.

23
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:11,524
He ask how you survive.

24
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:16,988
I ...

25
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:27,958
I escaped.

26
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:40,971
Who organize this place?

27
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:46,518
I don't know.
It's some kind of hunting club. They ...

28
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:50,146
They all have the same tattoo.

29
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:51,439
It's a dog.

30
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:53,191
It's a bloodhound dog.

31
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:10,458
Strange that you mention this tattoo.

32
00:06:11,752 --> 00:06:12,877
Why?

33
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,391
Because someone was found dead
in a train station bathroom in Vienna ...

34
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,019
with this same bloodhound tattoo
you describe.

35
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,530
Security tapes from this station
show him entering from a platform ...

36
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:44,868
where a train arrive earlier that day
from Slovakia.

37
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:47,579
It came through
the same station in Vienna.

38
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:54,044
You were on that tape.

39
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:03,678
Did his tattoo look something like this?

40
00:07:04,138 --> 00:07:05,805
What the fuck's going on?

41
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:08,224
Help! Somebody help me!

42
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:22,113
Jesus.

43
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:35,210
You hungry?

44
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:37,712
It's 3:15 in the morning.

45
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,632
I have to take these with food.
I wanna know if you want anything.

46
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,760
Yeah, I want you to talk to someone.

47
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,846
When are you gonna tell
Josh's mother what happened?

48
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:48,348
I'm not.

49
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:52,519
She still thinks her son's in Europe.

50
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:54,979
What the fuck
am I supposed to tell her?

51
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:58,233
- She'll go straight to the police.
- Yeah, exactly. Someone should.

52
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,570
No, no one should. You don't get it.
These people are tied into everyone.

53
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:04,197
Somebody starts asking questions ...

54
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,282
they're gonna come after me
and find me.

55
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,495
At my grandmother's house? I've
been coming here since I was a kid.

56
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:13,498
I can barely find the place.
I had to ask my sister for directions.

57
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,750
- You told your sister we were here?
- Yeah. So?

58
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:18,461
- Well, who else knows?
- No one!

59
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:20,130
Jesus.

60
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:23,758
I'm doing this for your protection too.
You know that, right?

61
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:26,302
Oh, Paxton ...

62
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:29,639
Look.

63
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:32,642
I took you back because I felt bad.

64
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:35,562
But you're going crazy.

65
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:39,232
You wake up every night screaming,
and I can't sleep.

66
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,025
Well, that won't
be a problem anymore.

67
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:42,861
Paxton, that's not what I --

68
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:46,197
Oh, fuck.

69
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,229
Morning!

70
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,083
Paxton?

71
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:49,469
Hey.

72
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:12,093
Lorna?

73
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:17,807
Sorry. I was trying to be
in the moment.

74
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,976
Absorb.

75
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:28,443
Do you think she ever saw a cock
before this class?

76
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:30,945
If she did, it was in a Botticelli.

77
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:32,405
Oh, my God.

78
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:36,492
If I hear her talk about how emotional
the Botticelllis are one more time ...

79
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,454
I swear to God,
I'm gonna choke the bitch to death.

80
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:49,714
Until Tuesday.

81
00:11:49,882 --> 00:11:51,299
Are you all packed for Prague?

82
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:53,885
- Jeans. No heels.
- Awesome.

83
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:56,596
I can't do it on the cobblestone.
I don't know how you do it.

84
00:11:56,764 --> 00:11:58,890
I can teach you if you bring heels.

85
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:05,772
Axelle.

86
00:12:14,406 --> 00:12:17,658
Hands on your pencils, boys.

87
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,675
- Would he ever?
- Excuse me, girls.

88
00:12:34,843 --> 00:12:36,177
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

89
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:39,097
- May I see?
- Oh, they're just rough.

90
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:41,808
Show her. Don't be shy.

91
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:46,729
That's the one of you.

92
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:50,316
- Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
- Thanks.

93
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:52,026
How much would you want for it?

94
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:54,153
I wouldn't sell them.
You can have this one.

95
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:55,863
- Really?
- Yeah.

96
00:12:56,031 --> 00:12:59,325
- Oh, my God, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

97
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:01,744
Can I buy you a drink or something?

98
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:05,373
Oh, I'm actually late. We're
catching a train to Prague, but ...

99
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,917
- I don't know. Maybe some other time.
- Okay.

100
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:09,961
- Yeah! Okay.
- Okay.

101
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:13,548
- I'll see you.
- All right. Bye. Thanks.

102
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:24,225
No, Dad. It's Prague.
We're gonna be fine.

103
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:26,310
It's not the Ukraine.

104
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:30,189
No.

105
00:13:32,151 --> 00:13:34,485
No, Dad,
do not book the Four Seasons.

106
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:36,154
Book it, bitch. Book it. Please!

107
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:40,324
Because, Dad, no college students
are staying at the Four Seasons.

108
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:45,121
And, you know, it's for old people.
So thank you, but please don't.

109
00:13:45,831 --> 00:13:47,248
What?

110
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:52,795
Yeah. Yes, we have chaperones.

111
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:54,839
Okay, love you. Bye.

112
00:13:55,257 --> 00:13:57,967
Jesus, I hate that he calls
every fucking five minutes.

113
00:13:58,135 --> 00:14:01,345
- All right, let's go.
- Hold on. We gotta wait for someone.

114
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,264
Who?

115
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:08,686
- Yeah.
- No.

116
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:11,522
She cornered me in the apartment.
She's homesick, crying.

117
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,357
I felt bad. What am I supposed to say?

118
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:16,736
She's homesick for Baltimore?
We're in Rome, for fuck's sake.

119
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:18,571
She's not that bad.

120
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:36,797
Wow, is that a new journal
you got there?

121
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:39,800
Yeah. It's a travel journal.

122
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,552
For emotional call-backs.

123
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:43,721
Of course.

124
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,141
Lorna, we're gonna grab a drink.
You wanna go?

125
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,310
I'm okay. Thank you.

126
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:53,481
All right.
Well, we'll see you in a little bit. Okay.

127
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:56,234
Knock yourself out, buddy.

128
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:58,027
See you later.

129
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:12,833
Excuse you. Asshole.

130
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:26,180
She's like a 20 year-old grandmother.

131
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:28,474
Whatever. She'll watch our stuff.
She's happy there.

132
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:30,977
That's what she likes to do.

133
00:15:31,144 --> 00:15:32,603
Oh, we didn't order these.

134
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:34,605
They're from girl.

135
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:39,944
Whoa, your girlfriend's stalking us.

136
00:15:41,488 --> 00:15:43,239
Hey. What are you doing?

137
00:15:43,657 --> 00:15:45,866
You inspired me to take a trip.

138
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:56,711
Watch this.

139
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:01,632
You've got to be kidding me.

140
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,301
Hello. What's your name?

141
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,979
Do you know where we could score,
like, party favors?

142
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:16,689
What do you need?

143
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:20,067
I don't know.
Like, bud and ecstasy and, like ...

144
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:22,903
PCP?

145
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:25,406
Ice? Peyote? Crank?

146
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:27,783
Okay, okay, bud and X are good.

147
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:31,537
Sure.

148
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:36,167
We go back to my car. I got some.

149
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:37,752
Yeah?

150
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:41,339
- Yeah?
- Okay.

151
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:54,310
Fuck. You know what?

152
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:58,856
I'm trying but I can't find them.
Just hang on, yeah?

153
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:06,614
- You want drink?
- No, I'm fine.

154
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:17,875
Hey, you know what?

155
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:21,212
It's okay because we can just get
it at the club when we go to Prague.

156
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,339
No, stay.

157
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,593
I find them. Okay?

158
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:35,059
You smell nice.

159
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,939
- Whit, we gotta go. Lorna's waiting.
- Yeah, we have our friend.

160
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:41,482
- You have friend?
- Yeah.

161
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,027
One, two, three, perfetto. Otherwise,
we have to take turns, huh?

162
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:50,366
You know, we're gonna go,
so never mind.

163
00:17:50,534 --> 00:17:54,870
Where you go? I knew you were
a tease, you fucking cunt.

164
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:56,372
What the fuck did you call me?

165
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,375
I called you
stupid fucking American cunt!

166
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:00,751
- Fuck you!
- You know what?

167
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,422
The train to fucking Prague
is long, you bitch.

168
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,340
We'll come see you.

169
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:08,426
Are you fucking insane?

170
00:18:08,593 --> 00:18:09,969
What? I fucking hate that word.

171
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:12,513
"Oh, you stupid American cunt."
I fucking lost my temper.

172
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:14,974
Okay, but it's not like
we're on campus and you can ...

173
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:17,768
call the dean
and file a report or something.

174
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:24,984
Oh, my God. Lorna, what happened?

175
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:27,361
Some guy took my iPod.

176
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:28,779
What?

177
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:31,782
Is there, like, a police officer
on the train or something?

178
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:34,452
- Yeah. I'll go check.
- Okay.

179
00:18:36,288 --> 00:18:37,580
It had everything.

180
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:41,292
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

181
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,628
I'm sorry.

182
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:50,259
Here you go.

183
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:06,192
It's those fucking guys.

184
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:09,487
The fucking guys, the Italian guys
from the room down the hall.

185
00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:12,406
- What do we do?
- Just be quiet.

186
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:22,166
- Hi.
- Hi.

187
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:24,710
Excuse me.
Did one of you girls lose this?

188
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:26,921
Oh, my God!

189
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:29,340
How did you know this was mine?

190
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:32,760
I saw some guy run out of your room.
He tried to take my bag.

191
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:35,554
I fought him off
and this felled out of his pocket.

192
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:38,516
I'm a little worried he might
come back looking for me.

193
00:19:38,683 --> 00:19:41,185
Well, do you wanna come in here
and hang out with us?

194
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:43,229
- Really?
- Yeah, we have an extra seat.

195
00:19:43,396 --> 00:19:44,563
- Yeah, come in.
- Totally.

196
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:45,940
Thank you.

197
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,528
I think ...

198
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:52,613
we all need a little of this.

199
00:19:53,532 --> 00:19:55,032
Oh, awesome.

200
00:19:56,368 --> 00:19:58,577
Oh, no, thanks. I don't drink.

201
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,704
Thank you.

202
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:03,415
As my father always says:

203
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,876
"Nazdrovia." To your health.

204
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,059
So are you going to Prague
for the football match?

205
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:24,061
I kind of wanna go home.

206
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:28,732
Oh, I don't blame you. I got
robbed twice on the overnight train.

207
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,776
There are so few safe places
left in Europe.

208
00:20:31,403 --> 00:20:32,695
So where are you going?

209
00:20:33,738 --> 00:20:35,364
On a little spa vacation.

210
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:36,866
Where?

211
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,617
Slovakia.

212
00:20:38,785 --> 00:20:41,078
Wait, wasn't there, like,
some war in Slovakia?

213
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:45,416
There hasn't been war in Slovakia
for 50 years.

214
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:46,834
That's Bosnia, darling.

215
00:20:47,002 --> 00:20:49,336
- Oh, like you knew.
- I did so.

216
00:20:49,504 --> 00:20:51,088
What are the spas like there?

217
00:20:51,256 --> 00:20:54,925
They're the best natural hot springs
in the world.

218
00:20:55,093 --> 00:20:59,179
I go twice a year. It's great to get away
from the Italian guys.

219
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:00,723
They get to be a bit much.

220
00:21:01,892 --> 00:21:03,934
Wow, hot springs?

221
00:21:04,102 --> 00:21:07,479
That sounds so therapeutic.
I wanna go.

222
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:11,233
It's very easy. You just have to
switch trains in Prague.

223
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,612
It could be nice.

224
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:19,408
You know? I had enough gross guys
for one weekend.

225
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:22,411
Okay, we'll go.

226
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,584
Do you know of a good place to stay?

227
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,965
- Smart move with the shoes.
- What? It's so easy. You have to try it.

228
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:05,537
Hi. Can I help you?

229
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:08,248
- I need a room for my friends, please.
- Yeah, cool.

230
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,459
Your passports, please.

231
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,465
American. Good.

232
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:19,385
Yeah, cool. It's 10 Euros for night.

233
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:22,680
No. I got this one.

234
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:24,139
No. It's on me.

235
00:22:24,307 --> 00:22:26,600
- Thank you.
- Money.

236
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:28,602
Thanks.

237
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:32,356
Here are your keys.

238
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:37,528
And this is a notice for
the harvest fair tonight, girls.

239
00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:40,531
Will be sexy good times. Come on.

240
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:43,575
It's Dožinky. I know that.
They have it every year.

241
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:47,496
- Yeah.
- Lots of music, dancing, costumes.

242
00:22:47,664 --> 00:22:49,748
Oh, my gosh! Could we go?

243
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:53,919
- It sounds kind of gay.
- Excuse me.

244
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:02,594
Oh, we are so going to
the harvest festival.

245
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:06,140
- Come on. This way.
- Thank you.

246
00:23:06,683 --> 00:23:08,642
You're welcome.

247
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:14,398
Do you think they have any frescoes
in the room?

248
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:39,131
Wow, this room feels so timeless.

249
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,258
Are you kidding right now?

250
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:45,471
Oh, my God!

251
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:48,599
Sexy.

252
00:23:49,893 --> 00:23:51,310
Come here.

253
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:03,483
Yes! Yes!

254
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:05,444
Yeah!

255
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:07,905
That's what I'm talking about, huh?

256
00:26:30,428 --> 00:26:32,179
Todd, what's up?

257
00:26:33,514 --> 00:26:36,558
Yeah, nothing.
We're just finishing up breakfast.

258
00:26:39,062 --> 00:26:40,437
Really?

259
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:45,943
Wow, I didn't think --

260
00:26:47,528 --> 00:26:49,947
Jesus. You sure?

261
00:26:51,032 --> 00:26:56,119
Yeah, yeah, okay. I can go right now.
I'll tell her I have to meet a client.

262
00:26:56,871 --> 00:26:58,497
Okay.

263
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:00,624
See you.

264
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:12,970
No respect for me.
No respect for mother earth.

265
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:16,056
Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself?

266
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:20,310
Well, that's just fine.
We can all ride home in silence.

267
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:31,571
Gosh! This village is so enchanting.

268
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,408
Lorna, are you having a
"journal-gasm" right now?

269
00:27:34,575 --> 00:27:36,660
Actually, yes. Multiple ones.

270
00:27:36,828 --> 00:27:39,871
I get to write about
how beautiful this village is ...

271
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,582
and I get to write about
what a raving bitch you are.

272
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:47,170
She comes back swinging!

273
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:50,048
- Well-played.
- Thank you.

274
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:56,096
Dollar!

275
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:58,307
Do you guys have a dollar?

276
00:27:58,474 --> 00:28:00,892
- I got it.
- Oh, no, no, no.

277
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,021
No, no, no. I got it. I got it.
Let me.

278
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:10,569
I have Smints.

279
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:14,239
Would you like a Smint?

280
00:28:26,794 --> 00:28:28,545
Bitches!

281
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:37,304
Welcome to Slovakia.

282
00:28:45,313 --> 00:28:48,899
You both have corner suites
with views of the river.

283
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:51,151
Here are your pagers.

284
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:54,112
Perfect. Thank you.

285
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,034
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

286
00:28:59,744 --> 00:29:01,203
Really?

287
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:03,872
Because you look like
your dog just died.

288
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,750
I'm just jet-lagged, man.
I'll take a shower and I'll feel better.

289
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:09,211
- All right.
- Thanks.

290
00:29:12,965 --> 00:29:15,300
Oh, my God!

291
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,317
Hey, guys!

292
00:30:14,735 --> 00:30:15,819
Yes?

293
00:30:16,237 --> 00:30:17,904
For the apartment.

294
00:30:18,156 --> 00:30:20,157
Awesome, dude.

295
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:23,034
Those swords are like 1,000 Euros.

296
00:30:23,202 --> 00:30:25,370
Trust me, she can afford it.

297
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,249
Does she get, like,
a really big allowance?

298
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,918
No, it's more like an inheritance.

299
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,047
Her mom died when she was 12 and,
like, left her everything.

300
00:30:36,215 --> 00:30:38,133
And so she keeps her dad
on an allowance.

301
00:30:39,427 --> 00:30:41,052
- Really?
- Yeah.

302
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,474
She could pretty much buy Slovakia
if she wanted to.

303
00:30:47,768 --> 00:30:50,353
Yeah. It's pretty rad.

304
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:19,007
Yeah!

305
00:31:20,092 --> 00:31:22,010
Badass.

306
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:25,263
Let me see this motherfucker.

307
00:31:30,311 --> 00:31:32,062
You're up, bro.

308
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:38,568
I think I'm gonna pass on the tattoo.

309
00:31:38,736 --> 00:31:40,195
Come on, man, sit down.

310
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:43,740
A tattoo's not really me.
It's not my style.

311
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:47,744
I didn't know and I don't like needles.
I don't like needles very much.

312
00:31:47,912 --> 00:31:50,455
Dude, what are you doing? Sit down.

313
00:31:50,623 --> 00:31:53,583
Here's the problem. Linda. What
is she gonna say when she sees this?

314
00:31:53,751 --> 00:31:57,170
My wife is not gonna
really understand.

315
00:31:57,338 --> 00:31:59,839
Is there some other option?

316
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:03,218
Everyone must get tattooed.
Part of contract.

317
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:04,553
Yeah.

318
00:32:04,762 --> 00:32:05,971
Let's do it. Come on, man.

319
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:08,223
Why don't you sit down?
These guys aren't playing.

320
00:32:08,474 --> 00:32:11,101
A tattoo is
a little difficult to explain, Todd.

321
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,270
Didn't seem like you had
any problem explaining ...

322
00:32:13,437 --> 00:32:15,814
the gonorrhea you brought back
from Thailand.

323
00:32:15,982 --> 00:32:18,525
Can't believe you're bringing up
the gonorrhea. Every time --

324
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:20,902
Is there any problem here?

325
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,573
No, no. I just didn't know
that this was part of it.

326
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,578
Stuart.

327
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:34,583
This is not like going to a whorehouse.
You can't just back out.

328
00:32:40,423 --> 00:32:43,258
Get in the fucking chair.

329
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,516
Yeah.

330
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:56,187
Come on, man. Look at this.

331
00:32:56,606 --> 00:32:58,815
I'm fucking proud of mine.

332
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:18,293
Look what I found!

333
00:33:18,794 --> 00:33:22,505
Okay, and before you say anything,
it's cider, it's non-alcoholic ...

334
00:33:22,673 --> 00:33:24,841
and those little kids right there
made it.

335
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,718
- Oh, my gosh, really?
- Yeah.

336
00:33:26,886 --> 00:33:28,845
- I'm gonna go say thank you.
- Okay.

337
00:33:29,013 --> 00:33:31,473
They don't speak much English.

338
00:33:33,976 --> 00:33:38,355
This is quite possibly the most
alcoholic cider I've ever tasted.

339
00:33:38,648 --> 00:33:40,315
Come on, it's good for her.
She needs it.

340
00:33:40,483 --> 00:33:42,067
Thank you.

341
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:44,569
Well, cheers.

342
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:51,743
Oh, my God, my song! Let's go!

343
00:33:53,412 --> 00:33:54,663
Come!

344
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:01,753
Come on, Borat.
Let's see what you got.

345
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:23,566
There they are.

346
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:24,901
Three o'clock.

347
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:27,070
- Jesus.
- Right?

348
00:34:27,238 --> 00:34:29,489
It's fucking crazy, huh?
Dead ringer.

349
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:32,075
Happy fucking birthday, bro.

350
00:34:35,705 --> 00:34:39,082
- Dude, where you going?
- In for a better look.

351
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:05,859
Me?

352
00:35:47,318 --> 00:35:50,695
Hi.

353
00:35:50,905 --> 00:35:54,574
Would you like to dance with me?

354
00:35:56,076 --> 00:35:57,994
No, thank you. I'm --

355
00:35:58,162 --> 00:35:59,662
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

356
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,331
Come on. I'll show you how.

357
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:03,666
No, really. It's easy.

358
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:09,964
No. Thank you, really, but my feet.
I'm tired.

359
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,178
I could have helped you.

360
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:18,723
Excuse me?

361
00:36:25,815 --> 00:36:29,150
Hey.

362
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:31,986
That guy make you some troubles?

363
00:36:32,196 --> 00:36:34,656
No. He's fine.

364
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:38,576
What he say to you?

365
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:42,330
Nothing. He just wanted to dance.

366
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:46,751
He won't bother you anymore.

367
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,879
Oh, he wasn't bothering me.

368
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:56,719
Here. Take a drink.

369
00:37:04,144 --> 00:37:07,397
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

370
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:15,905
- Oh, I'm so sorry!
- Don't worry about it.

371
00:37:16,073 --> 00:37:18,074
I'm so, so sorry. I'm such an idiot.

372
00:37:18,242 --> 00:37:19,826
No, it's all right.

373
00:37:20,244 --> 00:37:22,996
- Here, let me get you a drink.
- No, you don't need to.

374
00:37:23,163 --> 00:37:24,539
- No, I insist.
- No, no.

375
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:26,457
I insist.

376
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:37,760
Beth! Beth!

377
00:37:37,928 --> 00:37:41,389
Beth! Oh, my God, Roman wants to
take me on a boat ride ...

378
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:43,516
and he's just so suave
and he's amazing ...

379
00:37:43,684 --> 00:37:46,436
and he doesn't speak English,
but we understand each other.

380
00:37:46,604 --> 00:37:51,608
Yeah. Just promise me you won't
go on a boat ride with him, okay?

381
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:53,109
Why not?

382
00:37:53,277 --> 00:37:55,153
What's the big deal?
You don't fancy him?

383
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:58,948
Just because he's not "Whitney
approved" or "Beth approved" looking?

384
00:37:59,116 --> 00:38:02,452
No, I'm not saying that at all. I just
want you to stay here where it's safe ...

385
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,495
we're all together,
we don't get separated.

386
00:38:04,663 --> 00:38:06,956
Just promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

387
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:18,885
Lorna, promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

388
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:23,765
Beth. It's okay.

389
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:26,267
- Okay. You promise?
- Okay, okay, okay.

390
00:38:26,644 --> 00:38:28,102
Okay.

391
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,189
Roman.

392
00:38:31,941 --> 00:38:33,942
Okay, two, please.

393
00:38:35,694 --> 00:38:39,364
- Here you go. I'm so sorry about that.
- It's okay.

394
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:41,950
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Thanks.

395
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,666
So, what brings you
to this corner of the world?

396
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:53,252
Her. Firestarter.

397
00:38:54,421 --> 00:38:55,964
And you?

398
00:38:58,384 --> 00:39:00,593
I honestly don't know.

399
00:39:03,514 --> 00:39:06,140
I'm sorry, there's probably ...

400
00:39:06,308 --> 00:39:09,268
a small army of Slovak boys
all fighting over you.

401
00:39:09,436 --> 00:39:13,106
Why travel all this way
just to talk with an ugly American?

402
00:39:13,273 --> 00:39:15,316
You're not that ugly.

403
00:39:15,484 --> 00:39:17,026
Really?

404
00:39:18,237 --> 00:39:19,862
Well, cheers to that.

405
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,531
Cheers.

406
00:39:22,408 --> 00:39:24,534
Hey, your friend looks like
she's having fun.

407
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:27,078
Yeah.

408
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:29,706
I get to listen to them have sex later.

409
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:33,918
Can we switch?
I'm over at the Dvorzak hotel and ...

410
00:39:34,253 --> 00:39:37,964
it's probably been three centuries
since anybody's had sex over there.

411
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:41,300
Oh, maybe your table's ready.

412
00:39:43,053 --> 00:39:46,347
That's -- That's a long story.

413
00:39:47,307 --> 00:39:49,183
Well, I'll have to hear about it
another time.

414
00:39:49,393 --> 00:39:51,394
I'm gonna take off,
but it's a small village ...

415
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:53,563
I'm sure we'll meet again.
- I'm sure we will.

416
00:39:53,731 --> 00:39:55,565
All right. Good night.

417
00:39:55,983 --> 00:39:57,150
Good night, Beth.

418
00:39:58,736 --> 00:40:00,528
Did I tell you my name?

419
00:40:00,779 --> 00:40:02,989
No, no. I heard your friend use it.

420
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:07,035
But I forgot to tell you mine. I'm Stuart.

421
00:40:07,244 --> 00:40:09,245
Good to meet you, Stuart.

422
00:40:09,747 --> 00:40:11,330
Good night.

423
00:40:22,426 --> 00:40:28,598
Lorna!

424
00:40:35,397 --> 00:40:36,773
Lorna.

425
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:40,276
Excuse me.

426
00:40:45,532 --> 00:40:50,411
Lorna!

427
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:53,581
Beth, I'm sorry!

428
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:56,501
You promised.

429
00:40:57,086 --> 00:40:58,920
I know.

430
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:01,130
I'm sorry!

431
00:41:39,837 --> 00:41:42,255
It's so peaceful.

432
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,508
It's so secluded.

433
00:41:50,013 --> 00:41:52,640
Roman, what are you doing?

434
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:03,985
Come to me.

435
00:42:12,744 --> 00:42:14,745
Close your eyes.

436
00:42:17,082 --> 00:42:26,507
Roman! Roman!

437
00:42:46,278 --> 00:42:48,446
 --on a boat
and I have no idea where she is.

438
00:42:48,614 --> 00:42:52,033
- How does she get back from that?
- Beth, come on!

439
00:42:53,202 --> 00:42:55,077
Oh, fuck!

440
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,372
Beth!

441
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:01,417
I cannot leave her alone with this guy.

442
00:43:01,585 --> 00:43:05,046
You know, you just go ahead
and I'll wait for Lorna.

443
00:43:05,214 --> 00:43:07,215
- You go. Yeah.
- Yeah?

444
00:43:07,382 --> 00:43:09,258
- All right. Thank you so much.
- Okay.

445
00:43:09,426 --> 00:43:10,968
- Sure. Yeah.
- Thank you.

446
00:43:11,261 --> 00:43:12,595
Fuck!

447
00:43:12,763 --> 00:43:15,598
- Dude, are you coming?
- Are you okay?

448
00:43:15,766 --> 00:43:17,475
I'm good. I'm good. No, I'm fine.

449
00:43:17,643 --> 00:43:19,518
- Are you all right?
- Dude, I'm fine.

450
00:43:19,811 --> 00:43:21,896
Have another cocktail.

451
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:28,236
All right, good night.

452
00:43:28,904 --> 00:43:31,113
No, Whit. We're going to sleep.

453
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:32,573
- We are?
- Yeah.

454
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:35,910
Okay, is he hot,
or is he too, like, eastern bloc?

455
00:43:36,078 --> 00:43:39,288
He's fine. But can we please go
get some rest? Come on.

456
00:43:39,456 --> 00:43:41,290
Oh, you're so sweet. No, I'm fine.

457
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:43,459
It's okay. I'll take care of her.

458
00:43:43,835 --> 00:43:47,463
I'm sure you will, but not tonight,
all right? Good night, Miroslav.

459
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:49,715
Good night, Miroslav!

460
00:43:56,598 --> 00:44:00,059
I'm sorry. He was just so shady.

461
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,145
Whatever. I wanted to fuck him, but ...

462
00:44:03,438 --> 00:44:06,983
I know you did. I'll make it up to you.

463
00:44:07,693 --> 00:44:11,320
I guess Mr. Rabbit's gonna have to
go down the hole again tonight.

464
00:44:14,157 --> 00:44:15,741
Do you have a AA?

465
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:17,910
Mr. Rabbit!

466
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,413
Come here, Rabbit!

467
00:44:26,044 --> 00:44:28,713
Do you remember the first guy
in your high school to get laid?

468
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,172
No, but I remember the last.

469
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,508
Well, I do. This kid Greg.

470
00:44:32,676 --> 00:44:37,430
He came back from summer break,
something about him had changed.

471
00:44:37,597 --> 00:44:40,891
It wasn't anything he said or did, but
something was different. You knew it.

472
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:45,062
I know what you mean. It's like you can
sense it the way an animal senses it.

473
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,772
Exactly. Like an animal.

474
00:44:47,024 --> 00:44:50,526
Sometimes you meet a guy and there's
something fucking scary about him ...

475
00:44:50,694 --> 00:44:53,529
something that makes you think,
"This guy has killed somebody."

476
00:44:53,697 --> 00:44:56,866
He doesn't have to act tough.
He never has to say it.

477
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:59,702
But like an animal, you can sense it.

478
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,123
You know that this guy's got the balls
to do what few others can.

479
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:06,917
And that's you after today, my friend.

480
00:45:07,085 --> 00:45:10,212
People are gonna fucking fear you.
Linda is gonna fucking fear you.

481
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,217
What we do today is gonna pay off
every day for the rest of our lives.

482
00:45:15,761 --> 00:45:18,929
- Where's your pager?
- It's back in the room.

483
00:45:19,097 --> 00:45:21,390
- Come on. What the fuck?
- I just figured you had yours.

484
00:45:21,558 --> 00:45:24,393
Is it me? Because it feels like
you're, like, having second thoughts.

485
00:45:24,561 --> 00:45:27,563
You've never really been into this.
I feel like I'm talking you into it.

486
00:45:27,731 --> 00:45:30,316
I don't wanna be doing something
and keep talking about it --

487
00:45:30,484 --> 00:45:35,071
- It's different from taking on an image.
- I am so fucking tired of talking about it.

488
00:45:35,238 --> 00:45:37,573
It's time we fucking do it.

489
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:48,459
To the next level.

490
00:45:48,627 --> 00:45:50,753
To the next level. No, wait.

491
00:45:50,921 --> 00:45:52,755
Isn't it bad luck to toast with water?

492
00:45:52,923 --> 00:45:56,842
Yeah. Bad luck
for whoever meets us today.

493
00:46:01,515 --> 00:46:04,058
Yeah. Let the games begin.

494
00:46:24,538 --> 00:46:26,122
Hard, hard, hard.

495
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:27,998
Hey.

496
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:31,961
- Hey, did she call?
- No. I just checked.

497
00:46:32,462 --> 00:46:35,381
I love that Lorna's the only one of us
that got any action last night.

498
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:38,968
- Hey, I tried.
- Keep trying.

499
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:42,304
Yeah, she'd say
this place is majestic.

500
00:46:42,472 --> 00:46:43,472
Sure.

501
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,474
I bet she's making him
breakfast right now.

502
00:46:45,642 --> 00:46:47,226
No, I bet she's in a cum coma.

503
00:46:47,978 --> 00:46:49,687
Thank God.

504
00:46:50,981 --> 00:46:53,315
At least she has something
to write about in her journal.

505
00:50:59,145 --> 00:51:00,688
Please! Please!

506
00:51:00,855 --> 00:51:02,690
Please! Stop!

507
00:51:02,899 --> 00:51:04,066
No!

508
00:51:04,234 --> 00:51:06,902
Stop! Please! Please!

509
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:15,244
Please! Please!

510
00:51:15,412 --> 00:51:18,163
Please, no!

511
00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:47,836
Relax.

512
00:52:52,008 --> 00:52:53,634
Come up here.

513
00:54:26,436 --> 00:54:28,061
Whit?

514
00:54:36,821 --> 00:54:38,655
Axelle?

515
00:54:59,552 --> 00:55:01,136
Fuck.

516
00:55:04,474 --> 00:55:06,016
Whit!

517
00:55:07,894 --> 00:55:09,728
Guys!

518
00:55:13,775 --> 00:55:16,318
Axelle! Whit!

519
00:56:00,363 --> 00:56:01,863
Stop. Please help me!

520
00:56:02,031 --> 00:56:03,532
- Go away.
- Please help me!

521
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,200
- Just go away from me!
- No, no, no.

522
00:56:05,576 --> 00:56:07,536
Help me.
These men are chasing me. Please.

523
00:56:07,704 --> 00:56:11,540
I tried to help, but you don't listen.
Go away!

524
00:56:41,571 --> 00:56:43,363
Dollar, bitch!

525
00:56:51,622 --> 00:56:53,373
Stop!

526
00:57:25,448 --> 00:57:27,074
Get in.

527
00:57:27,283 --> 00:57:28,784
Yeah.

528
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:04,814
The police will be here soon.

529
01:00:05,441 --> 01:00:07,525
They are looking for your friends.

530
01:00:08,236 --> 01:00:09,903
Thank -- Thank you.

531
01:00:10,446 --> 01:00:12,030
More tea?

532
01:00:12,406 --> 01:00:13,907
Please.

533
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,039
Thank you.

534
01:00:36,138 --> 01:00:37,973
So, you and Sasha ...

535
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:41,810
are you two ...?
- Oh, no. God, no.

536
01:00:41,978 --> 01:00:43,770
He's old enough to be my dad.

537
01:00:45,982 --> 01:00:47,649
What does he do?

538
01:00:47,817 --> 01:00:49,693
He does auctions.

539
01:00:50,152 --> 01:00:52,570
Come. Let's get you some clothes.

540
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:25,186
No!

541
01:01:27,189 --> 01:01:30,400
Help! No! No!

542
01:01:49,253 --> 01:01:51,379
What did I do wrong?

543
01:01:54,216 --> 01:01:57,719
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me. I'm sorry.

544
01:01:58,512 --> 01:02:00,347
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

545
01:02:00,514 --> 01:02:02,724
I not hurt you.

546
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:05,435
Okay. It's okay.

547
01:02:05,603 --> 01:02:06,811
I clean you up.

548
01:02:07,688 --> 01:02:10,148
Please, please help me.

549
01:02:10,983 --> 01:02:13,026
You have a bruise.

550
01:02:16,072 --> 01:02:17,614
What is that?

551
01:02:17,782 --> 01:02:19,491
What are you doing?

552
01:02:21,202 --> 01:02:23,161
I make you pretty.

553
01:02:24,497 --> 01:02:25,955
Pretty for what?

554
01:02:26,874 --> 01:02:28,583
For the client.

555
01:02:28,918 --> 01:02:31,086
Client? What client?

556
01:02:58,948 --> 01:03:00,323
Give me. No.

557
01:03:00,533 --> 01:03:01,533
No.

558
01:03:04,662 --> 01:03:05,787
We do ...

559
01:03:06,622 --> 01:03:08,581
nails.

560
01:03:31,021 --> 01:03:32,147
No!

561
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:44,325
No! No!

562
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:52,417
Oh, my God.

563
01:03:54,003 --> 01:03:55,420
No!

564
01:04:05,347 --> 01:04:07,140
I'm worried about Whit.

565
01:04:09,477 --> 01:04:11,644
Whitney seems like a tough girl.

566
01:04:11,812 --> 01:04:13,813
She'll be okay.

567
01:04:17,276 --> 01:04:19,444
You have a scratch.

568
01:04:21,405 --> 01:04:22,822
Yeah.

569
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:35,502
- It's sore.
- I'm sorry.

570
01:04:36,462 --> 01:04:39,380
You have such beautiful skin.

571
01:04:39,548 --> 01:04:41,132
Thank you.

572
01:04:44,762 --> 01:04:45,970
Who's that?

573
01:04:46,972 --> 01:04:48,973
Just some friends.

574
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,434
Come. You should lie down.

575
01:04:51,602 --> 01:04:53,603
I'll wake you up when the police arrive.

576
01:06:54,099 --> 01:06:55,933
Do you think we're sick?

577
01:06:57,436 --> 01:06:58,645
Fuck, no.

578
01:06:59,355 --> 01:07:02,106
Dude, you look anywhere in the world
where there's no law ...

579
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:05,526
whether it's fucking Chad
or New Orleans ...

580
01:07:05,694 --> 01:07:07,737
and this is the shit
people are doing, bro.

581
01:07:09,907 --> 01:07:11,866
We're the normal ones.

582
01:07:18,123 --> 01:07:19,832
Any idea what
you're gonna do in there?

583
01:07:23,087 --> 01:07:29,050
You don't even wanna know.

584
01:10:58,594 --> 01:11:00,177
Jesus.

585
01:12:10,499 --> 01:12:12,208
They're listening. They're listening.

586
01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:17,797
Beth, it's me. It's Stuart.
From the fair.

587
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:21,050
Don't talk loud. Okay?

588
01:12:21,218 --> 01:12:24,011
If they hear us talking like this ...

589
01:12:24,346 --> 01:12:26,055
they're gonna fucking kill us both.

590
01:12:26,848 --> 01:12:27,974
You hear me?

591
01:12:28,475 --> 01:12:30,309
I need to know you're listening.

592
01:12:31,853 --> 01:12:33,521
Okay?

593
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,454
What the fuck are you doing?

594
01:12:50,872 --> 01:12:54,208
What is this place?
Where the fuck are we?

595
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:56,919
Stuart!

596
01:12:58,588 --> 01:13:02,383
Remember when I said that
I didn't know what I was doing here?

597
01:13:04,302 --> 01:13:05,886
Well ...

598
01:13:07,723 --> 01:13:09,890
this is what I'm doing here.

599
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:14,395
What is this place?

600
01:13:16,606 --> 01:13:18,399
This place ...

601
01:13:19,735 --> 01:13:21,569
People come here ...

602
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,031
People come here to kill people.

603
01:13:26,575 --> 01:13:29,910
What? Who kills?

604
01:13:30,829 --> 01:13:32,830
Oh, my God, are they gonna kill us?

605
01:13:33,373 --> 01:13:34,582
Well ...

606
01:13:36,043 --> 01:13:37,543
not ...

607
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:38,961
us.

608
01:13:40,255 --> 01:13:42,214
Oh, my God.

609
01:13:42,632 --> 01:13:44,884
Oh, my God. Are you gonna kill me?

610
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:48,262
- You're gonna kill me!
- No. No, no! No, no, no.

611
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:51,557
No. Jesus, no. No.

612
01:13:51,808 --> 01:13:54,143
Then what the fuck
are you doing here?

613
01:13:54,311 --> 01:13:55,936
What the fuck are you wearing?

614
01:13:56,104 --> 01:13:58,105
Someone brought me here ...

615
01:13:58,273 --> 01:14:00,066
the same as you.

616
01:14:00,942 --> 01:14:02,693
Someone I know.

617
01:14:03,987 --> 01:14:05,446
Look ...

618
01:14:05,655 --> 01:14:07,448
he wanted me to --

619
01:14:07,616 --> 01:14:10,284
To do this with him.

620
01:14:10,869 --> 01:14:12,453
What?

621
01:14:12,871 --> 01:14:14,121
Stuart, please.

622
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:16,957
Please just let me go.
Help me get out of this chair.

623
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:21,295
Please. Please help me get out of this
chair. Get me out of this chair, please!

624
01:14:43,819 --> 01:14:47,279
You probably used that face to get
whatever the fuck you wanted.

625
01:14:47,739 --> 01:14:49,740
Fucking skank.

626
01:15:03,171 --> 01:15:05,589
Oh, that's fucking rich.

627
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:08,717
You should see your fucking face.

628
01:15:12,639 --> 01:15:15,933
- We gotta get out of here.
- We can't.

629
01:15:16,643 --> 01:15:18,978
They think you're gonna kill me?

630
01:15:19,437 --> 01:15:21,689
You're not some monster.

631
01:15:23,358 --> 01:15:25,693
- I'm not that guy.
- No.

632
01:15:25,861 --> 01:15:27,153
No, I know.

633
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,905
- I know you're a good person.
- I'm not that guy.

634
01:15:30,615 --> 01:15:32,741
I know. Of course not.

635
01:15:32,909 --> 01:15:34,702
I'm not that guy.

636
01:15:37,998 --> 01:15:41,333
- Okay. Okay.
- I'm not that guy.

637
01:15:44,212 --> 01:15:46,172
We're gonna get out of here.

638
01:15:53,013 --> 01:16:06,609
I'm not that guy.

639
01:16:07,694 --> 01:16:09,486
There must be a co --

640
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:34,428
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

641
01:16:50,445 --> 01:16:53,155
Christ! Fuck!

642
01:16:53,949 --> 01:16:55,324
God!

643
01:16:57,410 --> 01:16:58,494
Fuck!

644
01:16:59,746 --> 01:17:03,082
Don't you have family?
Don't you have a wife?

645
01:17:03,917 --> 01:17:07,294
My wife?

646
01:17:09,506 --> 01:17:11,382
I'm not allowed to kill my wife.

647
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,946
- Finish?
- Yeah, I'm finished, all right.

648
01:17:34,114 --> 01:17:36,991
Hey, hey! You cannot done.

649
01:17:37,158 --> 01:17:38,909
You go in room, finish.

650
01:17:39,619 --> 01:17:41,120
You know what? I am fucking done.

651
01:17:41,288 --> 01:17:43,789
If you don't like it, you can go in
and finish her yourself.

652
01:17:43,957 --> 01:17:46,583
You cannot leave unless
you complete. It's contract.

653
01:17:46,751 --> 01:17:48,419
I fucking paid!

654
01:17:48,586 --> 01:17:50,421
You have my money
and you can keep it!

655
01:17:50,588 --> 01:17:54,008
I am not going back in that room!
I'm done!

656
01:17:54,175 --> 01:17:56,051
Hey! Hey!

657
01:18:54,778 --> 01:18:57,196
Hello. Special offer.

658
01:18:57,364 --> 01:19:00,783
But she's only available
for the next 20 minutes.

659
01:19:00,992 --> 01:19:02,618
Do you want her?

660
01:19:07,457 --> 01:19:09,124
We'll let you know.

661
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:51,333
Six-fifty.

662
01:20:10,437 --> 01:20:11,437
Yes?

663
01:20:11,938 --> 01:20:16,817
Apologies for interrupting you, but
we have special available right now.

664
01:20:16,985 --> 01:20:18,318
Very good price.

665
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,993
Where's Todd?

666
01:20:38,298 --> 01:20:40,048
Problem with friend.

667
01:20:43,428 --> 01:20:45,762
May I borrow this
for a moment, please?

668
01:20:52,061 --> 01:20:53,645
What do you think?

669
01:20:53,813 --> 01:20:55,522
Should I do it?

670
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:57,983
I mean, I wouldn't pay
more than a grand for her ...

671
01:20:58,151 --> 01:20:59,985
in this kind of shape, but ...

672
01:21:00,153 --> 01:21:02,029
I mean, look at that.

673
01:21:02,197 --> 01:21:04,114
She's not gonna last that long, huh?

674
01:21:06,034 --> 01:21:08,494
You should see
what she did to my friend.

675
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:15,209
I'll take her.

676
01:21:56,209 --> 01:21:58,502
A souvenir from your friend.

677
01:22:08,596 --> 01:22:10,722
Notice anything different about me?

678
01:22:13,434 --> 01:22:15,519
I bet you fucking do.

679
01:22:16,563 --> 01:22:18,397
Fucking bitch.

680
01:22:23,111 --> 01:22:25,279
Fucking respect me now.

681
01:22:27,115 --> 01:22:29,575
I don't fucking work for you!

682
01:22:30,702 --> 01:22:33,870
I don't work all fucking day
for you to humiliate me.

683
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:38,750
To tell me I'm shit.

684
01:22:43,047 --> 01:22:44,506
Never fuck me.

685
01:22:45,883 --> 01:22:47,467
Look at you.

686
01:22:47,969 --> 01:22:49,303
What?

687
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:52,514
What, you got something to say?
Do you? You do, bitch?

688
01:22:52,682 --> 01:22:56,143
Yeah? Oh, good.
Well, it better be fucking good.

689
01:22:56,519 --> 01:23:00,063
- Let's fucking hear it. What?
- I'm not your wife.

690
01:23:00,231 --> 01:23:04,026
I'm not your wife, Stuart.
I'm not your wife.

691
01:23:05,028 --> 01:23:09,740
She doesn't understand you.
She doesn't understand you like I do.

692
01:23:09,907 --> 01:23:13,118
- And I see how you're strong.
- I am strong.

693
01:23:13,286 --> 01:23:16,038
- I am fucking Hercules!
- I see.

694
01:23:16,956 --> 01:23:19,541
I know. I know. I see it. I see it.

695
01:23:19,876 --> 01:23:21,335
I saw it last night.

696
01:23:21,502 --> 01:23:25,088
I was hoping you would kiss me.
I wanted you to kiss me.

697
01:23:26,841 --> 01:23:29,217
I thought about you all night.

698
01:23:36,225 --> 01:23:38,435
Get on the fucking floor.

699
01:23:48,363 --> 01:23:49,821
Are you scared?

700
01:23:52,742 --> 01:23:54,785
You fucking better be.

701
01:23:56,454 --> 01:23:58,038
I am.

702
01:23:58,915 --> 01:24:00,749
I like it.

703
01:24:14,847 --> 01:24:16,431
Look at me.

704
01:24:18,685 --> 01:24:20,060
Bitch.

705
01:24:21,396 --> 01:24:24,189
You fucking whore.

706
01:24:49,132 --> 01:24:51,007
Get in the chair!

707
01:24:51,175 --> 01:24:53,009
Get in the fucking chair!

708
01:24:57,181 --> 01:24:58,682
Fucker!

709
01:25:16,033 --> 01:25:17,033
What's the code?

710
01:25:17,326 --> 01:25:19,202
Fuck you!

711
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:24,875
What's the fucking code?

712
01:25:28,463 --> 01:25:30,297
- Your birthday.
- What?

713
01:25:30,465 --> 01:25:32,299
What is your birthday?

714
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:34,426
December 12th.

715
01:25:36,053 --> 01:25:38,722
Oh, that is fucking sick.

716
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:56,948
What the fuck? It's not opening.

717
01:25:58,701 --> 01:26:01,453
It's not fucking opening!

718
01:26:01,621 --> 01:26:03,497
Oh, yes, it is.

719
01:26:04,749 --> 01:26:07,834
Do it! She's right up there
behind you! Kill her!

720
01:26:08,002 --> 01:26:10,837
Motherfucker! Shoot her!

721
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:13,548
Kill her! Kill her!

722
01:26:16,803 --> 01:26:18,553
Don't shoot!
Be careful, for God's sakes!

723
01:26:18,721 --> 01:26:20,764
She'll cut! She'll fucking cut!
Don't shoot!

724
01:26:20,932 --> 01:26:22,307
Fucking she'll cut! She'll cut!

725
01:26:23,518 --> 01:26:24,851
Get Sasha!

726
01:26:25,061 --> 01:26:28,980
You gotta do it! I'm the fucking
customer here! Do it, for fuck's sake.

727
01:26:29,148 --> 01:26:31,024
Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, shit!

728
01:26:31,192 --> 01:26:32,275
- Sasha!
- Get him!

729
01:26:50,086 --> 01:26:52,045
- Wait! I wanna buy my way out of here.
- Wait!

730
01:26:55,383 --> 01:26:58,385
- You can't afford it.
- Don't tell me what I can't afford.

731
01:26:58,553 --> 01:27:02,764
There's nothing I can't afford. I could
buy and sell everyone in this room.

732
01:27:03,891 --> 01:27:06,101
You going to call your parents
for money?

733
01:27:06,269 --> 01:27:08,395
No, motherfucker, it's my money.

734
01:27:08,563 --> 01:27:11,606
Just get me a PDA, a SWIFT number
and a recipient name.

735
01:27:11,774 --> 01:27:14,693
I have accounts in Switzerland,
Luxembourg and the Isle of Man.

736
01:27:14,861 --> 01:27:18,947
Just name your fucking price!
Trust me, I got it.

737
01:27:20,783 --> 01:27:22,367
Okay.

738
01:27:27,874 --> 01:27:29,040
We negotiate.

739
01:27:30,251 --> 01:27:33,128
- This is bullshit!
- This is business.

740
01:27:33,421 --> 01:27:34,504
I'll pay more!

741
01:27:34,922 --> 01:27:36,923
Not with a second mortgage
on your house ...

742
01:27:37,091 --> 01:27:39,175
and your daughter's
private-school tuition.

743
01:27:39,594 --> 01:27:41,344
That's why your friend pay.

744
01:27:41,512 --> 01:27:43,430
What's the number?

745
01:27:44,515 --> 01:27:46,933
Money is not the only issue.

746
01:27:47,101 --> 01:27:48,768
We have contract here.

747
01:27:49,562 --> 01:27:51,021
What kind of contract?

748
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:55,108
Anyone who come to this place ...

749
01:27:55,276 --> 01:27:56,943
cannot leave ...

750
01:27:57,111 --> 01:27:58,737
without killing.

751
01:27:59,614 --> 01:28:03,199
They're still gonna kill you,
you fucking stupid cunt.

752
01:28:04,577 --> 01:28:06,328
What did you say to me?

753
01:28:08,247 --> 01:28:11,082
You're a stupid fucking cu --!

754
01:28:27,934 --> 01:28:29,309
Let him bleed to death.

755
01:28:31,062 --> 01:28:32,145
Misha, no!

756
01:29:12,687 --> 01:29:14,688
Isn't this great?

757
01:29:20,987 --> 01:29:23,279
Hey, get back here!

758
01:29:25,408 --> 01:29:26,658
Wait!

759
01:29:26,826 --> 01:29:28,743
Wait! Wait!

760
01:29:30,496 --> 01:29:31,621
Wait!

761
01:29:32,707 --> 01:29:33,707
Hey!

762
01:29:34,125 --> 01:29:36,751
You fucking shit! Wait!

763
01:34:38,804 --> 01:34:47,817
Bitches!

763
01:34:48,305 --> 01:35:48,660
