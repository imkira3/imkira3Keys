1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,342
No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

3
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:12,381
I'm lost!
Where's the line?

4
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,441
<i>It just went away.
What do I do?</i>

5
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,544
- Help!
- We'll be stuck here forever!

6
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:19,987
Do not panic.
Do not panic!

7
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,583
We are trained professionals.
Now, stay calm.

8
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,821
We are going around the leaf.

9
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,729
A- Around the leaf?
I don't think we can do that.

10
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:32,667
Oh, nonsense. This is nothing
compared to the twig of '93.

11
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,570
That's it. That's it. Good!

12
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,303
You're doing great!
There you go. There you go!

13
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,572
Watch my eyes.
Don't look away.

14
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:46,606
- And here's the line again.
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Soil.

15
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:49,676
Good job, everybody!

16
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,188
<i>Oh, my.
There's quite a gap, Mr. Soil.</i>

17
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,623
- Shouldn't we tell the queen?
- I don't think we need
to involve the queen in this.

18
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:59,390
She's got enough on her plate already,
training her daughter.

19
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:03,365
Oh, yes.
Princess Atta, the poor dear.

20
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:07,097
Oh, wind's died down.
They'll be here soon.

21
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:11,073
- Just be confident, dear.
You'll be fine.
- There's a gap.

22
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:14,077
<i>There's a gap in the line.
What are we gonna do?</i>

23
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:17,672
It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen.
We just lost a few inches, that's all.

24
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:19,682
Oh. Right.

25
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:23,748
Your Highness, I can't count
when you hover like that.

26
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:25,755
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

27
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:28,417
- Guys, go shade
someone else for a while.

28
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:30,653
Okay, Atta.
Now what do we do?

29
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:34,994
Ahh... Oh! Don't tell me.
I know it. What is it?

30
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,500
<i>- We relax.
- Right.</i>

31
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:40,969
Oh, it'll be fine.
It's the same, year after year.

32
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:44,269
They come, they eat, they leave.
That's our lot in life.

33
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:46,776
It's not a lot, but it's our life.

34
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:51,474
Isn't that right, Aphie?
Oh, you're such a cute little aphid.

35
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,418
- Ditch Dot!
- Yeah, yeah!

36
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:57,750
Hey, come back here!

37
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:01,658
<i>- Dot!
- Yes, Mother.</i>

38
00:04:01,726 --> 00:04:04,252
What did I tell you
about trying to fly?

39
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:06,627
Not until my wings grow in.

40
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:08,632
<i>- Right.
- But Mom...</i>

41
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,464
Dot, you're a young queen ant
and your wings are too little...

42
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:15,097
I was talking to Mother.
You're not the queen yet, Atta.

43
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:17,698
Now, Dot,
be nice to your sister.

44
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:20,006
<i>It's not my fault
she's so stressed out.</i>

45
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:22,205
I know, I know.

46
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:25,614
<i>- I'm always acting
like the sky is falling.
- Look out!</i>

47
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:28,346
- Atta!
- Princess Atta!

48
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:47,696
- Oh!
- Hey!

49
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:50,799
<i>- Stop that!
- What do you think you're doing?</i>

50
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:53,640
- You could have killed
somebody over here.
- I'm sorry!

51
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:56,613
- Oh, it's Flik.
- Oh...

52
00:04:56,682 --> 00:04:58,809
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

53
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:01,114
Please forgive me. I'm sorry!

54
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:04,121
- Princess Atta!
- Flik, what are you doing?

55
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:07,317
Oh, this! This is my new idea
for harvesting grain.

56
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:10,623
No more picking individual kernels.
You cut down the entire stalk!

57
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:15,190
- We don't have time for this.
- Exactly! We never have time
to collect food for ourselves.

58
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,360
We spend all summer
harvesting for the offering.

59
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:21,806
<i>- But my invention will
speed up production.
- Oh, another invention?</i>

60
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:23,808
Something for you too.

61
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:25,969
Since you're gonna be queen, you could
use this to oversee production.

62
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:29,503
<i>- Dr. Flora, if I may.
- This is all very nice, but...</i>

63
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:32,949
- Just an ordinary blade of grass
and a bead of dew, right?
- Flik, please.

64
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:37,547
Wrong! It is, in fact, a telescope.

65
00:05:37,623 --> 00:05:41,218
- It's very clever, Flik, but...
- Hello, Princess! Aren't you
looking lovely this morning!

66
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:44,092
Not that you would need
a telescope to see that.

67
00:05:44,163 --> 00:05:48,031
Listen! The princess doesn't
have time for this!

68
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:50,160
You wanna help fill this thing?
Get rid of that machine,

69
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:53,603
get back in line and pick grain
like everybody else!

70
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:56,767
- Like everybody else!
- Please, Flik. Just go.

71
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:59,004
I'm sorry,
I was really just trying...

72
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,013
trying to help.

73
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:10,713
<i>Harvester. Why, we harvested
the same way ever since I was a pupa.</i>

74
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,258
Where were we?

75
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:15,453
<i>- The food pile, Your Highness.
- Oh, yes, yes.</i>

76
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:18,224
Hey, Flik! Wait up!

77
00:06:18,297 --> 00:06:20,231
Oh. Hello, Princess.

78
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:22,859
You can call me Dot.
Here, you forgot this.

79
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:25,665
Thanks. You can keep it.
I can make another one.

80
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:30,072
- I like your inventions.
- Really? Well, you're the first.

81
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,874
- I'm beginning to think
nothing I do works.
- This works.

82
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:36,074
Great. One success.

83
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,983
- I'm never gonna make a difference.
- Me, neither.

84
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:42,784
I'm a royal ant and I can't
even fly yet. I'm too little.

85
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:45,791
- Being little's not such a bad thing.
- Yes, it is.

86
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,383
- No, it's not.
- Is too!

87
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:50,328
- Is not. Is not! Is not!
- Is too. Is too! Is too!

88
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:53,924
Oh! A seed.
I need a seed. Ahh...

89
00:06:58,705 --> 00:07:00,639
Ohh!

90
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:02,641
Ah, here, here.

91
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,735
Pretend... pretend
that that's a seed.

92
00:07:05,813 --> 00:07:07,906
- It's a rock.
- I know it's a rock.

93
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:11,747
<i>But let's just pretend for a minute it's
a seed. We'll just use our imaginations.</i>

94
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,753
Now, do you see our tree?

95
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:16,984
<i>Everything that made
that giant tree...</i>

96
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:20,390
is already contained
inside this tiny little seed.

97
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:23,521
All it needs is some time, a little bit
of sunshine and rain, and...

98
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:25,588
voila!

99
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,097
This rock will be a tree?

100
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,660
Seed to tree. You've gotta
work with me, all right?

101
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:33,899
You might not feel
like you can do much now,

102
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:36,568
but that's just because,
well, you're not a tree yet.

103
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:39,669
You just have to give yourself
some time. You're still a seed.

104
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:42,044
But it's a rock.

105
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:44,050
<i>I know it's a rock!</i>

106
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:48,054
Don't ya think I know a rock
when I see a rock? I've spent
a lot of time around rocks!

107
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:50,387
You're weird, but I like you.

108
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,124
They're here.

109
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:12,837
- They're coming!
- Run!

110
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:16,680
- Dot! Dot!
- Mom!

111
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:18,912
- Mom!
- Thank heavens!

112
00:08:18,987 --> 00:08:23,617
- Food to the offering stone.
- Everyone, single file.

113
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:27,218
Food to the offering stone
and into the anthill. Now let's go!

114
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:30,594
Go, go, go, go!

115
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,691
Come on, keep movin', keep movin'!
Good.

116
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,228
<i>Okay. That's everyone.</i>

117
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:04,531
<i>Hey!</i>

118
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:07,262
Hey, wait for me!

119
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:10,464
Get the food to the offering stone,
then into the anthill.

120
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:46,841
Princess Atta!
Princess Atta!

121
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:48,843
Princess Atta!

122
00:09:58,053 --> 00:10:02,114
They come, they eat, they leave.
They come, they eat, they leave.

123
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:04,659
Excuse me, pardon me.
Pardon me, excuse me. Coming through.

124
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:07,287
Sorry. Coming through. Princess Atta,
there's something I need to tell you.

125
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:11,390
- Not now, Flik. Shh!
- But Your Highness,
it's about the offering!

126
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:14,959
<i>Hey, what's goin'on?</i>

127
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:16,971
<i>Yeah, where's the food?</i>

128
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:23,407
<i>- What did you do?
- It was an accident?</i>

129
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:41,390
Boo!

130
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:45,726
Where's the food?

131
00:10:56,846 --> 00:10:59,076
Hopper.

132
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:27,137
So, where is it?

133
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,610
<i>Where's my food?</i>

134
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:35,448
- I-I-Isn't it up there?
- What?

135
00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:38,146
- The food was in a leaf
sitting on top...
- Excuse me.

136
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:40,349
Are you sure
it's not up there?

137
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:42,551
- Are you saying I'm stupid?
- No.

138
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:45,618
Do I look stupid... to you?

139
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:49,097
Let's just think about the logic,
shall we? Think about it for a second.

140
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,294
If it was up there,
would I be coming down here,

141
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,339
to your level,
looking for it?

142
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:57,840
- Uh, I...
- Why am I even talking to you?

143
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:00,604
You're not the queen.
You don't smell like the queen.

144
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,613
<i>Sh-She's learning
to take over for me, Hopper.</i>

145
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:08,846
Oh, I see. Under new management.
So it's your fault.

146
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:11,945
No, it wasn't me, it was...

147
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:16,686
<i>Uh-uh-uh. First rule of leadership:
Everything is your fault.</i>

148
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:20,492
- But-But I...
- It's a bug-eat-bug world
out there, Princess,

149
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:23,863
one of those circle-of-life
kind of things.

150
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:27,301
<i>Now, let me tell you
how things are supposed to work.</i>

151
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,432
The sun grows the food,
the ants pick the food,

152
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:33,500
the grasshoppers eat the food...

153
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:35,670
<i>And the birds eat the grasshoppers.</i>

154
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:39,045
Hey, like the one that nearly ate you,
you 'member? Oh, you shoulda seen it.

155
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:42,517
This blue jay has
him halfway down his throat,
and Hopper's kickin' and screamin'.

156
00:12:42,586 --> 00:12:44,520
<i>And I'm scared.
I'm not goin'anywhere near, okay?</i>

157
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:49,355
Aw, come on.
It's a great story. Ow, ow, ow.

158
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:53,295
I swear, if I hadn't promised
Mother on her deathbed...

159
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,993
<i>that I wouldn't kill you,
I would kill you.</i>

160
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:59,059
- And believe me, no one
appreciates that more than I do.
- Shut up!

161
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:01,401
I don't want to hear another word
out of you while we're on this island.

162
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,998
Do you understand me?

163
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:08,011
- I said, do you understand me?
- How can I answer? You said
I couldn't say another word.

164
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,639
Remember Ma!

165
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:18,850
Hey, I'm a compassionate insect.

166
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,586
There's still a few months
till the rains come,

167
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,027
so you can all just try again.

168
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,826
<i>But, Hopper, since it's
almost the rainy season,</i>

169
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,163
we need this time
to gather food for ourselves.

170
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,703
Listen, if you don't
keep your end of the bargain,

171
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,001
then I can't guarantee your safety.

172
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:38,907
And there are insects out there
that will take advantage of you.

173
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:42,208
Someone could get hurt.

174
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:55,351
What's the matter?
You scared of grasshoppers?

175
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,262
- Dot!
- You don't like Thumper?

176
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:05,028
Leave her alone!

177
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:18,782
You want her?
Go ahead... take her.

178
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:25,048
No?
Then get back in line.

179
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:34,465
It seems to me that you ants
are forgetting your place.

180
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:38,664
So let's double
the order of food.

181
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:40,672
No! But-But...

182
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,141
We'll be back
at the end of the season,

183
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,771
when the last leaf falls.

184
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:57,111
You ants have a nice summer.
Let's ride!

185
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:01,023
Yee-ha!

186
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:07,661
Ooh!

187
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,848
Flik, what do you have
to say for yourself?

188
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:26,316
Sorry. I... I'm sorry
for the way I am.

189
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,581
I didn't mean for things
to go so wrong.

190
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:31,146
I especially didn't want
to make you look bad, Princess.

191
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:34,489
- Well, Flik, ya did.
- I was just trying to help.

192
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:38,827
<i>- Then help us... don't help us.
- Help, help. Help?</i>

193
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:41,094
Flik, you are sentenced to
one month digging in the tunnels.

194
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:44,968
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Need I remind you of Flik's
tunnel-within-a-tunnel project?

195
00:15:45,038 --> 00:15:47,506
Helpers to help us.
That's it! We could...

196
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:49,838
It took two days to dig him out.
Send him to Health and Ant Services.

197
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,844
Heavens, no!

198
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:56,144
We could leave the island,
the river bed's dry.
We could walk across and get helpers.

199
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:59,014
We could! We could go
find helpers to help us.

200
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:03,022
- It's perfect!
- Perfect? What's so perfect?

201
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,491
Your Highness, don't you see?
We could send someone to get help!

202
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,551
Leave the island?

203
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:12,429
Why didn't I think of that?
Oh! Because it's suicide!

204
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:14,933
<i>- She's right! We never leave the island.
- Never leave!</i>

205
00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:17,368
There's snakes and birds
and bigger bugs out there!

206
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:19,667
Exactly! Bigger bugs!

207
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,265
We could find bigger bugs
to come here and fight...

208
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:24,936
and forever rid us
of Hopper and his gang!

209
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:28,106
- Ludicrous!
- Who would do a crazy thing like that?

210
00:16:28,181 --> 00:16:30,945
- I'll volunteer.
I'd be happy to volunteer.

211
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:34,681
You got a lot of spunk, kid,
but no one's gonna help a bunch of ants.

212
00:16:34,755 --> 00:16:39,055
At least we could try. I could travel
to the city! I could search there!

213
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:41,560
<i>If you went, you'd be
on that silly search for weeks.</i>

214
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:43,426
Royal huddle.

215
00:16:43,498 --> 00:16:46,626
- Great idea, Princess. It's perfect!
- Exactly.

216
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:49,670
- Wait a minute.
What did we just decide here?
- To let Flik leave.

217
00:16:49,737 --> 00:16:52,570
While we keep harvesting
to meet Hopper's demands.

218
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,043
- You see, with Flik gone, he can't...
- He can't mess anything up!

219
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:03,016
Flik, after much deliberation, we have
decided to grant you your request.

220
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:05,814
- Really?
- Really?
- Uh, really.

221
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:08,321
Oh, thank you, Princess.
Thank you so much for this chance.

222
00:17:08,389 --> 00:17:11,415
- I won't let you down,
I promise, I promise, I promise.
- That's fine. No, forget it.

223
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:15,588
- I should help repair
the damage before I go.
- No! No, no!

224
00:17:15,663 --> 00:17:17,790
<i>Just leave!</i>

225
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,928
Hey.

226
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:02,934
Don't worry!
The colony is in good hands!

227
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:05,275
Bye, now.

228
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:14,882
All right.

229
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:19,723
Hey, fellas.
Beautiful mornin', huh?

230
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:25,997
My dad gives you one hour
before you come back crying.

231
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:28,002
Does he, now?

232
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,038
- My dad doesn't think that.
- He doesn't, huh?

233
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:33,165
- Naw, he's bettin' you're gonna die.
- Oh.

234
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,972
He says if the heat doesn't get ya,
the birds will.

235
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:37,978
I think he's gonna make it.

236
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:41,675
- Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness.
- Yeah, Dot. What do you know?

237
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,980
Hey, hey, hey.
Ease up. Come on.

238
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:46,418
She's entitled
to her opinion too.

239
00:18:56,732 --> 00:18:58,757
<i>Ohh.</i>

240
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:00,995
So go, already.

241
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:03,367
- Hey!
- The city's that way.

242
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:07,966
- I know.
- You're supposed to look for bugs,
not dandelions.

243
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:10,511
You leave him alone.
He knows what he's doing.

244
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,638
<i>That's right.</i>

245
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:17,880
Here I go. For the colony,
and for oppressed ants everywhere!

246
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:21,957
Whoa-oh.

247
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:25,784
<i>- Wow!
- Hey!</i>

248
00:19:25,862 --> 00:19:29,059
- Hey-hey!
- Bye, Flik!

249
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:37,373
Wow!

250
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,206
Wow. Ohh!

251
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,147
Whoa!

252
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:47,706
Good luck, Flik!

253
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:50,810
Bye! Whoa-oh!

254
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:53,048
Flik!

255
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:56,319
I'm... okay!

256
00:19:56,392 --> 00:20:00,419
- Your dad's right. He's gonna die.
- You just watch.

257
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:04,398
He's gonna get the bestest,
roughest bugs you've ever seen!

258
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:10,901
Get back! Get back!
Get back, you horrible beast!

259
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:13,465
I have no fear! Aye-eee!

260
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:16,137
- Ooh!
- Oh, my goodness.

261
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:19,340
Oh, no!

262
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:24,145
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim. An owie?
- Owie! Owie, owie.

263
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,814
Please show Rosie the owie.
All right, Dim. It's okay.

264
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:33,526
I have been in outhouses
that didn't stink that bad.

265
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:36,293
This is ridiculous.
What a disappointment!

266
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,803
- Oh, no!
- You! Come here! I want my money back!

267
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,703
Uh, no refunds
after the first two minutes.

268
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,468
Popcorn! Stale popcorn!

269
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,533
We're losin' the audience!
You clowns get out there now!

270
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:51,138
- I hate performing on an empty stomach!
- Do your act, Heimlich.

271
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:54,548
- Then you can eat. Not now, Slim.
- P.T., what's the point?

272
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:57,883
What's the point of going out there?
They'll only laugh at me.

273
00:20:57,955 --> 00:21:02,051
- That's because you're a clown!
- No, it's because I'm a prop!

274
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:06,825
You always cast me as the broom,
the pole, the stick, a splinter.

275
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:09,195
You're a walkingstick.
It's funny!

276
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:11,564
- Now go!
- You parasite.

277
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:24,406
Tra-la-la-la-la.
Spring's in the air.

278
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:28,042
And I'm a flower with
nothing interesting to say.

279
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:30,052
A bee!

280
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,521
I am a cute little bumblebee!
Here I come!

281
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:37,822
Slow down, you flowers!

282
00:21:37,895 --> 00:21:42,525
Candy corn! Here,
let me help you to finish it.

283
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,763
Hey, cutie! Wanna pollinate
with a real bug?

284
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,509
<i>Ooh, come to papa!</i>

285
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:57,276
So, bein' a ladybug automatically makes
me a girl, is that it, flyboy? Huh?

286
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,909
- She's a guy!
- Francis, leave them alone.

287
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,182
- They are poo-poo heads!
- Not again.

288
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:06,018
Judging by your breath, you must have
been buzzin' around a dung heap all day.

289
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,458
- Come on, Francis.
You're making the maggots cry.

290
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,501
All right, we're dyin' out there.
Gypsy, quick! You and Manny...

291
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,697
Shh! He's in a trance.

292
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,332
Well, get him out of it!
You and your husband are up now.

293
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,342
Manny, we're on.

294
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,313
Oh? Yet again it is up to me
to rescue the performance.

295
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,316
Gypsy, come.

296
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,253
- The stage is the other way, dear.
- Yes, of course.

297
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,256
Anytime, pal!

298
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,622
- I'm gonna pick the hairs
out of your head one by one!
- Take your best shot!

299
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,627
- You name the place!
- Oh, yeah?

300
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,858
- Yeah, 'cause when you
get there, you are dead!
- Francis, let me handle this.

301
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:49,456
- That's no way to speak to a lady.
- I heard that, you twig.

302
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,231
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me
to present Manto the Magnificent...

303
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:56,796
and his lovely assistant, Gypsy!

304
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:04,077
From the most mysterious
regions of uncharted Asia,

305
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,642
I give you the Chinese Cabinet...

306
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,450
of Metamorphosis!

307
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,123
Rosie, whole troupe.
Onstage! Finale! Now!

308
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,855
<i>- Okay, I just need time to...
Coming, coming.
- Now!</i>

309
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,159
Tuck, Roll, let's get moving, guys.
We're up next.

310
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,999
Don't you understand?
We are up!

311
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,595
"Up-a."

312
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,833
- Hey!
- Hey! They don't understand me.

313
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,103
I summon the voice
of Confucius...

314
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,737
<i>Get off the stage,
you old hack!</i>

315
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:36,941
I demand to know who said that!

316
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:40,383
How dare you!

317
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,555
Ingrates!

318
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,457
<i>Manny? Manny!</i>

319
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:52,691
I only got 24 hours to live
and I ain't gonna waste it here.

320
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,699
Come on.

321
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,469
I've just about
had it with these losers!

322
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,665
Flaming death!

323
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,967
I hold in my hand the match...

324
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:10,379
the match that decides whether two bugs
live or die this very evening.

325
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,317
<i>In a moment, I will light
this trail of matches...</i>

326
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:19,016
<i>leading to a sheet offlypaper
dowsed in lighter fluid!</i>

327
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:23,688
Aimed directly at the flypaper
are Tuck and Roll,

328
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:26,231
<i>the pill bug cannonballs!</i>

329
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,358
<i>The cannon
will be triggered by Dim,</i>

330
00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:30,596
<i>trained tojump
at the sound of this bell...</i>

331
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,867
<i>set to go off in 15 seconds.</i>

332
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,671
<i>Our pill bugs'only hope
of survival is...</i>

333
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:40,679
our mistress
of the high wire, Rosie!

334
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:43,238
<i>Secured to a web line
of exact length,</i>

335
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:46,410
<i>Rosie will plummet down
to these two posts,</i>

336
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:50,013
spinning a web of safety
in less than 15 seconds!

337
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:56,057
Not good enough, you say?
Well, what if they were all...

338
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:58,063
blindfolded!

339
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,203
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I suggest that those of you...</i>

340
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,764
with weak constitutions
leave the arena,

341
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,640
<i>- for this act is so dangerous...</i>

342
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:14,111
That if the slightest thing
should go wrong...

343
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:17,412
- No!
- Go? Okay, through the tunnel...

344
00:25:17,484 --> 00:25:19,645
Whoa!

345
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:24,088
Whoa!

346
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:28,784
- P.T!
- Oh, no!

347
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,263
Oh!

348
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:37,133
- Water! We need some water!
- Water, water, water!

349
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:44,742
Get me outta here!

350
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:46,803
Oof!

351
00:25:48,883 --> 00:25:51,579
Wow!

352
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:58,122
- It's the web. I'm sorry.
- You're all fired.

353
00:25:58,192 --> 00:26:01,025
- We got the water!
- Here we come, P.T!

354
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:07,796
Whoo! Whoa!
Burn 'im again!

355
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:28,619
No, Harry, no!
Don't look at the light!

356
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:31,487
I can't help it!
It's so beautiful!

357
00:26:37,265 --> 00:26:39,563
Try not to look
like a country bug.

358
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:42,398
Blend... blend in.

359
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:45,405
<i>Hey, buggy!</i>

360
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,805
<i>What do you expect?
The guy's a tick.</i>

361
00:26:55,717 --> 00:26:59,016
<i>Wow! The city!</i>

362
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:18,296
<i>Making all stops to the septic tank,
including standing water,</i>

363
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:22,036
empty bean can and dead rat.

364
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,442
<i>Watch your stingers. All aboard!</i>

365
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:26,504
- Hey! Oh, sorry.
- Get out of the way!

366
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:29,175
- Watch where you're goin'!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

367
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,845
Oh, sorry!

368
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,548
<i>Oh. I'm really, really sorry.</i>

369
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:37,114
That was
an-an-an ac-ac-accident.

370
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:42,858
- Hey, let go of me!
- I'll show ya who's tough!

371
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:47,061
- And stay out!
- Tough bugs!

372
00:27:48,937 --> 00:27:51,872
- I knew an old lady
who swallowed a fly...
- Wow!

373
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,874
- Move it!
- Whoa!

374
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:58,003
<i>Hey, waiter! I'm in my soup!</i>

375
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,514
<i>I've been workin'out.
Feel my wing.</i>

376
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:03,107
Yo!
Two Black Flags over here!

377
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:08,111
- All right.
- Hair of the dog you bit.

378
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:10,716
Hey, who ordered
the pu-pu platter?

379
00:28:11,794 --> 00:28:15,423
Here ya go, slick. Enjoy.

380
00:28:15,498 --> 00:28:18,558
Ow! Aah!
Hey, I said no salt!

381
00:28:19,836 --> 00:28:23,237
Pardon me, sir.
I represent a colony of ants,

382
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:26,173
and I'm looking for tough bugs,
you know, mean bugs...

383
00:28:26,242 --> 00:28:29,234
Fired by a flea...
how humiliating!

384
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,246
Let's face it: We stink.

385
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:33,248
<i>- You fired!
- You fired!</i>

386
00:28:33,316 --> 00:28:36,945
- Oh, will you shut up?
- You fired!

387
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:40,045
Someday I will be
a beautiful butterfly,

388
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:42,455
and then everything
will be better.

389
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:46,621
I can't believe the troupe is
breaking up. We've always been together.

390
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:50,826
- Farewell, my friends.
- To the audience we'll never have.

391
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:57,934
Francis! Your boyfriends
from the circus are here!

392
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:02,034
There she is.

393
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:09,852
- Hello there, girly bug.
- Shoo, fly. Don't bother me.

394
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,013
Say, why don't you
tell our pal, Thud,

395
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:15,387
- what you said to us at the circus.
- Yeah.

396
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:19,053
- Somethin' about buzzin'
around a dung heap?

397
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:22,188
Excuse me. Hi. I represent
an ant colony, and we're...

398
00:29:22,265 --> 00:29:25,827
Hey, bartender!
Bloody Mary, O-positive.

399
00:29:25,903 --> 00:29:27,837
Aha!

400
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:31,173
Sir?

401
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:35,302
# Ladybug, ladybug
fly away home #

402
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:37,711
Not so tough now, are you?

403
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:39,908
All right, clown.
Get up and fight like a girl.

404
00:29:39,983 --> 00:29:43,475
- Get ready to do the Robin Hood act.
- I want to be LittleJohn!

405
00:29:43,554 --> 00:29:47,251
- What part can I play?
- You see, I'm looking for
tough, warrior bugs.

406
00:29:47,324 --> 00:29:51,658
<i>Stand back, ye flies! We are
the greatest warriors in all bugdom!</i>

407
00:29:51,728 --> 00:29:54,595
- Warrior bugs!
- My sword!

408
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:56,599
Swish, swish. Clang, clang.

409
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:58,601
- LittleJohn?
- What ho, Robin?

410
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:01,229
Justice is my sword
and truth shall be my quiver!

411
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:04,502
Wait, wait! No, no!
I want to watch this!

412
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:07,874
<i>- Jawohl!
- Thrust, parry, lunge!</i>

413
00:30:07,945 --> 00:30:10,243
Me thinketh it's not working!

414
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:12,714
Back to Sherwood Forest!

415
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:15,775
- Schnell! Schnell!
- What's going on in there?

416
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:30,426
Help! Help! Get me out!

417
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:45,649
<i>You're perfect!</i>

418
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:50,984
Oh, great ones! I have been scouting
for bugs with your exact talents!

419
00:30:51,055 --> 00:30:53,956
<i>- A talent scout.
- My colony's in trouble.</i>

420
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:57,927
Grasshoppers are coming! We've
been forced to prepare all this food.

421
00:30:57,996 --> 00:31:00,089
- Dinner theater!
- Food?

422
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:03,258
Please!
Will you help us?

423
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:06,735
Where are they?

424
00:31:06,804 --> 00:31:10,763
- We'll take the job!
- Really?
- Yes, yes, yes!

425
00:31:10,842 --> 00:31:13,276
You can explain
the details on the way.

426
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:15,835
Hey!

427
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:19,406
- Okay, come on, everyone. Break a leg!
- Whoa, you're vicious!

428
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:21,418
Hold on, Mr. Ant.

429
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:26,616
Amazing!
This is too good to be true!

430
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,274
Ooh!

431
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:51,939
So, you see, it was my fault
that Hopper's coming back.

432
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:55,247
But then, Princess Atta...
boy, is she one in a million...

433
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,255
she let me go out and find you.

434
00:31:57,323 --> 00:31:59,814
And after seeing you
fight off those flies...

435
00:31:59,892 --> 00:32:02,986
Boy, are those grasshoppers
in for a surprise!

436
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:29,521
- Dr. Flora!
- Oh, dear. Not another one.

437
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:31,556
- This is insane.
- Insane.

438
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:34,024
There's just not enough
food left on the island!

439
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:36,687
No way we can make double quota
before Hopper comes.

440
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:40,789
Well, we have to try, Thorny.
We don't have any choice.

441
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:42,891
Yeah, I know.

442
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:48,505
<i>Hey, look who's playing
lookout again... little Speck!</i>

443
00:32:48,574 --> 00:32:52,943
<i>- The name is Dot.
- Well, Spot, still lookin' for Flik?</i>

444
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,209
Forget it, Dot.
That loser's never coming back.

445
00:32:57,616 --> 00:32:59,675
<i>Flik!
He did it! He did it!</i>

446
00:32:59,752 --> 00:33:02,585
What? Quit shoving!

447
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:10,589
This is it!
This is Ant Island!

448
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:14,532
Flik! Over here!
Flik! Flik!

449
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:17,934
- Hey!
- He did it! He did it! Yea!

450
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:21,462
- He did it!
- Cool!

451
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,999
At the rate these leaves are dropping,
we're gonna need a miracle.

452
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:27,273
That's right!
We need a miracle!

453
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:33,949
Run for your lives!

454
00:33:42,128 --> 00:33:44,426
Ta-da!

455
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:54,336
Once again,
our reputation precedes us.

456
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,898
Hey, everybody!
Hey! I'm back!

457
00:33:56,976 --> 00:34:02,573
<i>Hey, guys! Hey-ey!
Look-look-look who's here with me!</i>

458
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:07,643
Flik! Flik! Flik! You're back!
I knew you could do it!

459
00:34:07,721 --> 00:34:10,417
- Flik?
- It's Flik!

460
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,723
- Flik has returned!
- He's back?

461
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:21,994
And he's accompanied
by savage insects!

462
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:27,768
<i>What? How? He wasn't supposed
to actually find someone!</i>

463
00:34:27,841 --> 00:34:30,276
Oh, look at this.
This is great. Look.

464
00:34:30,344 --> 00:34:32,778
<i>- Oh, my ticker!
- So, what are you supposed to be?</i>

465
00:34:32,847 --> 00:34:35,372
He's a stick, stupid.
You hit bugs with him.

466
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,316
- Well, that's an oversimplification.
- That's right, kids. Like this!

467
00:34:38,385 --> 00:34:40,319
- No! Put me down!
- Ow!

468
00:34:40,387 --> 00:34:44,653
- Hey!
- My, you just pop
right open there, dontcha?

469
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:48,058
- Ooh! Wow!
- Uh-oh. Kids, He's kinda ticklish.

470
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,723
Let's come on out. Careful.

471
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:56,795
Well, my boy, you came through.

472
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:59,897
Aphie and I are very impressed.

473
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:05,640
Princess Atta! Hey, guys, Princess Atta!
She's the one that sent me to find you!

474
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:09,274
- Did you see that
really big bug over there?
- He looks absolutely ferocious!

475
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:13,013
- They're our ticket out of this mess!
- They came just in time!

476
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:16,318
So, Princess Atta,
what do you think?

477
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,359
No-no-no, wait!
This was not supposed to happen.

478
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:22,886
Mayday, Mayday.
We're losin' the job.

479
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:24,897
We don't fight grasshoppers.

480
00:35:24,965 --> 00:35:27,832
<i>- We don't, but they will.
- Bingo!</i>

481
00:35:27,902 --> 00:35:30,530
We gotta sweeten the deal.

482
00:35:31,806 --> 00:35:34,798
Your Majesty,
ladies and gentlemen,

483
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,571
boys and girls of all ages,

484
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:41,376
our troupe here guarantees
a performance like no other!

485
00:35:41,448 --> 00:35:44,417
Why, when your grasshopper friends
get here, we are gonna...

486
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:47,319
knock them dead!

487
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:53,889
Boy, these folks are sure
hard up for entertainment.

488
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,834
<i>Come on, come on. Hurry!</i>

489
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:03,700
Wow!

490
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,860
Honey, relax.
You should be proud of yourself.

491
00:36:26,928 --> 00:36:30,796
- Your instincts on that boy
were right on the money.

492
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,203
And to make our official
welcome complete... Mr. Soil?

493
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:45,269
<i>- Yes, Your Highness?
- He's our resident thespian.</i>

494
00:36:45,347 --> 00:36:49,113
<i>Last year he played the lead
in Picnic.</i>

495
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:53,211
The children... and myself...
have quickly put together...

496
00:36:53,288 --> 00:36:57,315
a little presentation
in honor of our guests.

497
00:36:57,392 --> 00:37:00,225
Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub?

498
00:37:00,295 --> 00:37:02,560
Oh, aren't they adorable!
Ooh, they're cute!

499
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:09,461
The South Tunnel Elementary School
second grade class...

500
00:37:09,538 --> 00:37:14,168
would like to present you with this,
a mural we have drawn...

501
00:37:14,243 --> 00:37:18,145
of you bugs helping us
fight the grasshoppers away.

502
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:22,583
Oh, look at the beautiful colors
of the blood.

503
00:37:22,652 --> 00:37:26,179
We drew one of you dying because our
teacher said it would be more dramatic.

504
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:35,222
I tell you a tale of heroes so bold,

505
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:39,257
who vanquished our
grasshopper enemies of old.

506
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:43,728
Look, the last leaf has fallen.

507
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:47,037
We are the grasshoppers!
Where's our food?

508
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:50,237
Who will come
to save us poor ants?

509
00:37:50,313 --> 00:37:53,407
We are the warriors,
here to defend you!

510
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:59,411
<i>I die! Die! Die!</i>

511
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:07,424
Thank you, thank you! Oh, thank you!

512
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:10,260
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I say we go.

513
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:13,131
- Okay, honey. You're up.
- Oh. Um...

514
00:38:13,202 --> 00:38:17,264
<i>- Oh, oh, I-I...
- We're all very grateful to have...</i>

515
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:19,775
- Here, here.
- the warriors...

516
00:38:20,844 --> 00:38:22,778
Thanks.

517
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:27,112
- I'd like to thank the warriors
for helping us in our fight...

518
00:38:27,184 --> 00:38:30,210
Against the grasshoppers.

519
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:33,381
Secondly, I would like
to thank Flik...

520
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:36,085
- for his forthright thinking...
- Thank you, Your Highness.

521
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,391
Oh, sure, I'd like to take credit for
all of this, but that wouldn't be right.

522
00:38:40,464 --> 00:38:43,763
Because it was you, Princess Atta.
You believed in me...

523
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:46,894
<i>- Tell that ant that we need
to talk to him right now.
- Okay, okay.</i>

524
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,371
I know I've made mistakes in the past,
and I hope that this will make up...

525
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,670
- Flik!
- Not right now, Rosie.
I'm making a speech.

526
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:57,008
Now, I truly believe these bugs
are the answer to our...

527
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,449
No, there's no circus around here.
So, I...

528
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:10,686
Your Highness, the warriors
have called for a secret meeting
to plan for a circus...

529
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:14,026
<i>circumventing the oncoming hordes so
they can trapeze... trap them with ease!</i>

530
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:16,531
- Shouldn't I come too?
- No!

531
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,129
No, classified in the D.M.Z.
Gotta go A.S.A.P. You know,
strictly B.Y.O.B. Bye!

532
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:25,333
<i>Sorry. Sorry I have to take
the warriors away so early,</i>

533
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:29,140
but you know they have a lot to get
done, with the battle looming and all.

534
00:39:29,212 --> 00:39:31,612
<i>So, uh, please,
everyone enjoy the party.</i>

535
00:39:31,681 --> 00:39:34,378
"B.Y.O.B."?

536
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:36,920
Thanks again. Bye. Bye-bye.

537
00:39:36,988 --> 00:39:39,047
Okay, just...
just get in there. Go!

538
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:41,057
Go! Go, go, go!

539
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:46,262
Circus bugs?
How can you be circus bugs?

540
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,264
- What?
- Hey, hey, hey.

541
00:39:48,332 --> 00:39:51,028
<i>- You said nothin' about killin'
grasshoppers. You lied to us!
- Ja!</i>

542
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:53,229
Are you kidding?
Do you know what this is?

543
00:39:53,304 --> 00:39:55,738
This, my friends,
is false advertising.

544
00:39:55,807 --> 00:40:00,972
How dare you! You, sir,
are the charlatan in this scenario...

545
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:03,309
touting your wares
as a talent scout,

546
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:06,145
preying upon the hungry souls
of hapless artistes.

547
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:08,151
Good day to you, sir.

548
00:40:12,957 --> 00:40:16,757
Wait! No, no!
Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't go.

549
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:20,525
You have got to help me. Give me
some time, I'll come up with a plan.

550
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:25,035
- Just go tell them the truth!
- They can't know the truth.
The truth, you see, is bad.

551
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:29,096
I will be branded for life.
My children's children will
walk down the street,

552
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:34,201
people will point and say, " Look! There
goes the spawn of Flik, the loser!"

553
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:38,078
Oh... oh, you know, all right, fine.
Yeah, okay. Just go.

554
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:40,743
But if you could just do me
a little favor before you leave.

555
00:40:40,818 --> 00:40:44,618
If you could squish me,
that would be great, because, uh,

556
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:46,623
when they find out,
I'm as good as dead.

557
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:49,627
<i>- Flik!</i>

558
00:40:49,695 --> 00:40:53,096
<i>I really do think I should be
part of this meeting. Flik!</i>

559
00:40:53,165 --> 00:40:56,066
Aah! Princess Atta!
What a nice... surprise.

560
00:40:56,135 --> 00:40:58,069
Just what exactly is going on?

561
00:40:58,137 --> 00:41:00,935
I would like to speak
with the so-called "warriors."

562
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:03,065
You can't! They are in the middle
of a top secret meeting right now,

563
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:05,110
and they really should not
be disturbed... now.

564
00:41:05,177 --> 00:41:07,270
Right, guys?

565
00:41:07,346 --> 00:41:11,646
Could you ex... pl...
Could you excuse me, please?

566
00:41:11,717 --> 00:41:15,118
<i>- Wait, wait, wait! Please, don't go!
- I'm not going anywhere.</i>

567
00:41:15,187 --> 00:41:18,247
What is going on? Flik?

568
00:41:18,323 --> 00:41:22,259
Flik!
Ooh, I knew it!

569
00:41:22,327 --> 00:41:26,491
<i> Wait! Wait,
wait, wait, wait! Please! Don't go!</i>

570
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:30,725
- No!
- Quick, he's losin' it!

571
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:34,568
- You can't go! I'm desperate!
- Really? I couldn't tell.

572
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,905
Hmm. Come on, wings.

573
00:41:37,976 --> 00:41:40,410
Help!

574
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:43,676
Mother,
Flik is up to something.

575
00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:46,411
Okay, Flik, time to put ya down.
Get him off me!

576
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:48,646
He's cutting off the circulation.

577
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,984
- No, no, no, no!
- Let go!

578
00:41:51,056 --> 00:41:55,618
<i>- Please, please, don't go!
- Put the stick down.
Flik, I mean it, now.</i>

579
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:58,730
<i>- Drop the stick.
- Run!</i>

580
00:41:59,932 --> 00:42:03,368
Boy, he runs fast
for a little guy.

581
00:42:03,435 --> 00:42:07,031
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!

582
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:14,636
This way.

583
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:18,980
There they are.

584
00:42:19,052 --> 00:42:22,385
- A bird!
- Flik!

585
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:24,980
- Look!
- Dot!

586
00:42:25,058 --> 00:42:26,992
Flik!

587
00:42:29,963 --> 00:42:32,659
- Dot!
- My baby!

588
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,028
I gotcha! I gotcha!

589
00:42:37,103 --> 00:42:40,129
I gotcha, I gotcha!

590
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:42,766
Oww!

591
00:42:42,842 --> 00:42:44,867
Oooh.

592
00:42:44,944 --> 00:42:46,741
- I can't see!
- Somebody do something!

593
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:51,045
<i>- Are they all right?
- Did anyone see?
- What is happening?</i>

594
00:42:53,052 --> 00:42:55,885
- Dot?
- Good heavens, they're in trouble!

595
00:42:55,955 --> 00:42:59,220
- Francis, Francis, Francis,
Francis, Francis, Francis...
- Oh, you guys, I've got an idea!

596
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:01,157
Here! I've got it!

597
00:43:04,097 --> 00:43:06,657
Please, ma'am, wake up!
Wake up!

598
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:14,938
<i>- Help! Help!
- Yoo-hoo!</i>

599
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:20,275
Mr. Early Bird! How about
a nice, tasty worm on a stick?

600
00:43:20,346 --> 00:43:23,043
I'm going to snap.
I'm going to snap.

601
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:26,314
<i>Nice andjuicy, succulent...</i>

602
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:28,617
Let's go!

603
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,887
- There they are!
- Flik! Help!

604
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:38,064
Okay.

605
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:40,623
- Flik!
- It's going to be okay, Dot.

606
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:45,604
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Bye-bye, birdie!

607
00:43:45,673 --> 00:43:47,698
Help! I'm stuck!

608
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:50,608
<i>Pull me down!
Schnell, schnell, schnell!</i>

609
00:43:50,678 --> 00:43:54,808
<i>- The caterpillar's using
himself as live bait!
- How brave!</i>

610
00:43:59,953 --> 00:44:03,116
Suck it in, man!

611
00:44:08,962 --> 00:44:10,827
Ow. My leg!

612
00:44:24,144 --> 00:44:27,580
The bird!
Look out for the bird!

613
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,342
Flik!

614
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,850
Up-a, up-a!

615
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:54,833
What is that?

616
00:44:54,909 --> 00:45:00,176
That, my friends,
is the sound of applause!

617
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:16,726
Applause... I'm in heaven!

618
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:21,898
<i>Our Blueberry troop salutes you bugs
for rescuing our smallest member,</i>

619
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,904
<i>Princess Dot.</i>

620
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:27,567
And as a tribute to Miss Francis,
we've changed out bandannas!

621
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,169
We voted you
our honorary den mother!

622
00:45:31,246 --> 00:45:35,649
What? Great.

623
00:45:35,717 --> 00:45:39,551
- All right, girls. Let's move
your keisters outta here now.

624
00:45:39,621 --> 00:45:42,283
The patient needs her rest,
you know. Come on.

625
00:45:42,357 --> 00:45:45,326
Excuse, me, Flik.
Can I talk to you for a second?

626
00:45:45,393 --> 00:45:47,224
- Huh? Oh, sure.
- Oww!

627
00:45:47,295 --> 00:45:51,356
Again, thank you all,
very, very much.

628
00:45:51,433 --> 00:45:53,424
<i>- Oh, stop it.
- You're too kind.
- Thank you.</i>

629
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:55,960
You don't think I've offended
the warriors, do you?

630
00:45:56,071 --> 00:45:58,005
<i>You? No.</i>

631
00:45:58,073 --> 00:46:00,337
Oh, good. Because, you see,

632
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:03,776
when you first brought them here,
I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns.

633
00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:05,871
Ya did?

634
00:46:05,948 --> 00:46:07,882
<i>Don't tell 'em I said that.</i>

635
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:11,283
<i>Boy, that's all I'd need,
another royal blunder like that.</i>

636
00:46:11,353 --> 00:46:14,845
- Princess, you're doin' a great job.
- Thanks, you're sweet.

637
00:46:14,924 --> 00:46:17,518
You're wrong, but sweet.

638
00:46:17,593 --> 00:46:20,221
<i>- I know what everyone really thinks.
- I don't follow you.</i>

639
00:46:20,296 --> 00:46:25,791
Everyone... the whole colony. Nobody
really believes I can do this job.

640
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:28,530
<i>It's like they're all watching me,</i>

641
00:46:28,604 --> 00:46:32,870
- just, just...
- Waiting for you to screw up.

642
00:46:36,312 --> 00:46:39,406
- Flik, I owe you an apology.
- For what?

643
00:46:39,482 --> 00:46:43,441
Well, I haven't been that nice
to you, and... I'm sorry.

644
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:45,453
If there's any way I can
make it up to you...

645
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:47,455
Hey! I know!

646
00:46:47,523 --> 00:46:50,651
How would you like to be the queen's
official aide to the warrior bugs?

647
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:54,162
- Me?
- Oh, sure. You've got
a great rapport with them,

648
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,631
especially after that rescue...
it was very brave.

649
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,067
- Really? Naw, naw...
- Well, not every bug would face a bird.

650
00:47:01,136 --> 00:47:04,799
- I mean, even Hopper's afraid of'em.
- Yeah, well, I guess maybe I...

651
00:47:04,874 --> 00:47:08,605
- Say that again?
- I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds.

652
00:47:11,982 --> 00:47:13,916
Thank you.

653
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,245
- Hopper's afraid of birds!
- And I don't blame 'im!

654
00:47:19,322 --> 00:47:21,256
Oh, oh, oh,
this is perfect.

655
00:47:21,324 --> 00:47:24,157
We can get rid of Hopper,
and no one has to know that I messed up.

656
00:47:24,227 --> 00:47:26,320
You just keep pretending
you're warriors.

657
00:47:26,396 --> 00:47:29,888
Whoa, Flik, honey. We are not
about to fight grasshoppers, okay?

658
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:33,493
You'll be gone before the grasshoppers
ever arrive. Here's what we do.

659
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,504
Not another word.

660
00:47:35,572 --> 00:47:39,269
I don't know what you're concocting
in that little ant brain of yours,

661
00:47:39,342 --> 00:47:41,276
but we'll have no part of it.

662
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:44,370
<i>Excuse me? Could we get
the warriors'autographs?</i>

663
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:46,381
<i>Autographs? Ja!</i>

664
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:49,885
- Wow! Great!
- So, you fellas catch the action today?

665
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:52,012
Oh! The bird went...
And it just missed you!

666
00:47:52,088 --> 00:47:55,990
- Aren't you sweet?
- And the way you pretended
to be stuck in that crack!

667
00:47:56,059 --> 00:47:58,926
Oh, that's just all part of the plan.

668
00:47:58,995 --> 00:48:01,122
And then you dive-bombed
into the bush!

669
00:48:01,197 --> 00:48:04,598
- There you go, my boy.
- Wow! Thanks!

670
00:48:04,668 --> 00:48:06,636
"M-M-Maa-jor..."

671
00:48:06,703 --> 00:48:08,830
That's Major Manny, young cadet.

672
00:48:08,905 --> 00:48:12,966
- I outrank everyone here. Remember that.
- Yes, sir!

673
00:48:13,043 --> 00:48:14,977
- Dismissed!
- Wow!

674
00:48:15,045 --> 00:48:17,809
- When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a praying mantis!
- I'm gonna be a stick bug!

675
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:20,111
<i>Oh, they're all so cool,
I can't pick!</i>

676
00:48:20,183 --> 00:48:25,416
Delightful lads.
You were saying, Flik?

677
00:48:25,488 --> 00:48:28,617
All right.
We are going to build a bird...

678
00:48:28,693 --> 00:48:32,322
a bird that we can operate
from the inside, which would then be...

679
00:48:32,396 --> 00:48:36,890
...hoisted above the anthill
and hidden high in the tree.

680
00:48:36,968 --> 00:48:39,937
Then, right when Hopper
and his gang are below,

681
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:44,498
we'll launch the bird
and scare off the grasshoppers.

682
00:48:44,575 --> 00:48:46,873
Now it's going to take
everyone's involvement...

683
00:48:46,944 --> 00:48:49,276
...to make this plan
a reality.

684
00:48:49,347 --> 00:48:52,441
I know it's not our tradition
to do things differently,

685
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:56,008
but if our ancestors were able
to build this anthill,

686
00:48:56,087 --> 00:49:00,547
we can certainly rally together
to build this bird!

687
00:49:23,014 --> 00:49:26,643
- Perfect!
- Okay, hit your marks!

688
00:49:43,368 --> 00:49:45,893
Hi, Flik.

689
00:49:53,011 --> 00:49:55,172
- I love what you did with your antenna.
- Oh, thank you.

690
00:49:55,247 --> 00:49:58,216
Oh, look.
She's a natural mother.

691
00:49:58,283 --> 00:50:01,548
All right, that's it!
Out! Everybody out!

692
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:06,314
Now you're gonna cry, right?
See if I care. Go ahead, cry.

693
00:50:06,391 --> 00:50:08,689
Please, don't cry. Please.

694
00:50:14,733 --> 00:50:17,668
Ta-da!

695
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:23,867
Okay, lower, lower...

696
00:50:23,942 --> 00:50:26,911
- You got it. And that's it!
- Whoa!

697
00:50:26,978 --> 00:50:31,039
Up, up, up, up!

698
00:50:31,116 --> 00:50:33,607
Rabbit through the hole, chicken in the
barn, two by two by, there's the yarn.

699
00:50:33,685 --> 00:50:35,619
- Done!
- Ruben Kincaid!

700
00:50:36,688 --> 00:50:40,146
- Hey!
- Good job, guys! Nice work!

701
00:50:42,461 --> 00:50:48,195
<i>Up, down.
Up, down. Up, down.</i>

Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep.

703
00:51:13,092 --> 00:51:15,151
<i>Flik, watch out!</i>

704
00:51:15,228 --> 00:51:18,493
Look! I'm a beautiful butterfly!

00:51:24,003 --> 00:51:28,099
<i>There ya go. Goodjob, fellas.
Keep up the good work.</i>

706
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:34,073
Huh?

707
00:51:49,595 --> 00:51:51,825
Okay!

708
00:52:31,638 --> 00:52:34,903
You're fired!

709
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,484
Yes!

710
00:52:53,994 --> 00:52:58,624
Look at me!
I'm barefootin'! Whoo-hoo!

Ooh, don't even say that!
You know somethin'?

716
00:53:34,736 --> 00:53:37,227
You're makin' a lot of sense.
I mean, why take the risk?

717
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:40,297
- You should tell Hopper.
- Good idea.

718
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:43,037
<i>But, you know,
it's really not our place.</i>

719
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:46,342
You're his brother.
That makes you, like...

the vice president of the gang.

721
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,550
Wow! It kinda does,
doesn't it?

722
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:54,678
Okay, I'll tell 'im.
I should talk to you guys more often.

723
00:53:54,756 --> 00:53:58,624
- What if Hopper doesn't like it?
- Then the genius'll get smacked
and not us.

724
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,491
Vice President Molt.

Ooh, yeah, that's good.
Oh, that's good.

726
00:54:04,766 --> 00:54:08,759
- Ooh, a little lower. Ahh, lower.
- Hey ya, Hop.

727
00:54:08,836 --> 00:54:11,634
- Go away.
- That's fine.
Then I won't tell ya my idea.

728
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,640
- Good!
- Okay, okay. I'll tell ya anyway.

729
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,973
I've been thinkin'... which is somethin'
I do, bein' vice president and all.

<i>This is a thought, and it was mine:
Why go back to Ant Island at all?</i>

<i>- You don't even like grain.
- What?</i>

732
00:54:23,117 --> 00:54:25,585
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

733
00:54:25,653 --> 00:54:28,281
It wasn't even my idea.
It was Axle and Loco's!

734
00:54:28,356 --> 00:54:30,984
They talked fancy to me.
I got confused!

Yeah!

739

What was I thinking?
Going back to Ant Island.

740
00:54:54,984 --> 00:54:56,918
I mean, we just got here,

741
00:54:56,986 --> 00:54:59,318
and we have more than enough food
to get us through the winter.

<i>Right? Why go back?</i>

00:55:08,864 --> 00:55:12,630
- Yeah, but we can forget about him!
- Yeah, it was just one ant.

745
00:55:12,701 --> 00:55:15,033
- Ooo-oooh!
- One ant!

746
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:20,007
Yeah, you're right!
It's just one ant!

747
00:55:20,075 --> 00:55:23,875
- Yeah, boss. They're puny!
- Hmm, puny.

748
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:28,679
Say, let's pretend this grain
is a puny little ant.

749
00:55:28,751 --> 00:55:31,549
<i>- Didn't that hurt?
- Nope.</i>

750
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,056
- Well, how 'bout this one?
- Are you kiddin'?

751
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:38,389
Well, how 'bout this?

752
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:53,502
You let one ant stand up to us,

753
00:55:53,575 --> 00:55:56,567
<i>then they all might stand up.</i>

754
00:55:56,645 --> 00:56:01,673
Those puny little ants
outnumber us a hundred to one.

755
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:06,654
And if they ever figure that out,
there goes our way of life!

756
00:56:06,723 --> 00:56:12,252
It's not about food.
It's about keeping those ants in line.

757
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:15,263
That's why we're going back!

758
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:17,526
Does anybody else wanna stay?

759
00:56:19,836 --> 00:56:22,862
He's quite the motivational
speaker, isn't he?

760
00:56:24,307 --> 00:56:26,741
Let's ride!

761
00:56:42,192 --> 00:56:44,490
<i>- To the bird!
- The bird!</i>

762
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:56,104
Get down, roly boys!

763
00:56:56,172 --> 00:56:59,232
- How low can you go? Sing it now.
- # How low can you go #

764
00:56:59,309 --> 00:57:01,504
Do it, Princess. # How low can you go #

765
00:57:01,578 --> 00:57:03,978
And that's how my 12th husband died.

766
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:06,675
So, now I'm a widow. I mean,
I've always been a black widow,

767
00:57:06,749 --> 00:57:10,276
<i>but now I'm a black widow widow.</i>

768
00:57:12,689 --> 00:57:15,180
Whoo!

769
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:21,298
<i>- Thorny! Any sign of those fiends?
- Lemme check.</i>

770
00:57:24,468 --> 00:57:27,232
No, not yet.
But we'll be ready for 'em.

771
00:57:27,304 --> 00:57:30,137
Blueberries, dismissed!

772
00:57:30,207 --> 00:57:33,176
And, uh, quit beatin' the boys up.

773
00:57:33,244 --> 00:57:36,645
Those little raisins
do grow on ya.

774
00:57:36,714 --> 00:57:38,807
Hey, how you guys doin'?
Some party, huh?

775
00:57:38,883 --> 00:57:41,852
Is that grain dip fresh or what?

776
00:57:41,919 --> 00:57:44,149
Okay, I've told everyone you'll be
stationed deep in the command bunker.

777
00:57:44,221 --> 00:57:47,679
Party quiets down,
I sneak you out the back way
and then you're outta here forever.

778
00:57:49,527 --> 00:57:52,758
Dim don't wanna go.

779
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:56,527
<i>Well, if Dim stays he's gonna
need me here. He's not fully trained.</i>

780
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,534
I mean, house-trained.

781
00:57:58,602 --> 00:58:02,368
I, uh, I kinda promised the Blueberries
I'd teach 'em canasta.

782
00:58:02,439 --> 00:58:06,899
It seems we've been booked
for an extended engagement.

783
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:14,211
<i>Will you look at this colony?
Will you just look at this colony?</i>

784
00:58:14,285 --> 00:58:16,480
I don't even recognize it.

785
00:58:16,554 --> 00:58:18,852
I feel 70 again!

786
00:58:18,923 --> 00:58:23,121
Work that ab, baby!

787
00:58:23,194 --> 00:58:26,721
And I have you bugs to thank for it.
So... thank you!

788
00:58:26,797 --> 00:58:29,891
And, uh, thank you
for findin' 'em, Flik.

789
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:32,197
Me? Oh, ooh...
uh, uh, I'll get it.

790
00:58:32,269 --> 00:58:34,203
I mean, if you don't mind,
I'll just...

791
00:58:34,271 --> 00:58:36,206
It's all tangled up.

792
00:58:36,274 --> 00:58:38,435
- There.
- Ow!

793
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:40,740
I think I'll go check
on the bird.

794
00:58:43,248 --> 00:58:45,978
<i>- Bird's this way.
Yeah, the bird's that way.</i>

795
00:58:46,051 --> 00:58:49,077
She... What?

796
00:58:57,395 --> 00:59:00,455
Jiminy H. Cricket!

797
00:59:03,034 --> 00:59:06,265
<i>They're back!
Get ready, everybody!</i>

798
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:08,806
<i>Get to your posts!</i>

799
00:59:08,873 --> 00:59:11,774
Battle stations, everyone.
This not a drill.

800
00:59:11,843 --> 00:59:16,610
Come on, everyone. You know your jobs!
Let's go, go, go, go!

801
00:59:16,681 --> 00:59:19,741
Look out!

802
00:59:21,253 --> 00:59:23,244
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa there.
Steady, girls. That's it.

803
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:26,313
- Oh, it's P.T.
- P.T.?

804
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:30,953
Greetings and salutations!
Ooh-boppa-doo and how do you do?

805
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:35,398
I am the great P.T. Flea!

806
00:59:35,467 --> 00:59:38,664
I'm in need of your assis...
Oh, let's just cut to the chase.

807
00:59:38,737 --> 00:59:42,104
<i>Look, I've been goin'
from anthill to anthill.</i>

808
00:59:42,173 --> 00:59:45,472
I'm lookin' for a bunch of circus
performers. Have you seen 'em?

809
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:51,512
Wait a second.
Ain't that Staff Sergeant Slim?

810
00:59:51,584 --> 00:59:53,711
No, no, no. I'm sorry, no, but uh...

811
00:59:53,786 --> 00:59:55,720
<i>Be quiet!</i>

812
00:59:55,788 --> 00:59:57,881
Hey!

813
00:59:57,957 --> 00:59:59,788
<i> You'll probably...
you'll probably want to get goin'!</i>

814
00:59:59,859 --> 01:00:03,124
I guess you got a lot of other anthills
to check into, so, bye!

815
01:00:03,195 --> 01:00:06,460
- Ah, guys, I've been lookin'
all over for ya!

816
01:00:06,532 --> 01:00:10,059
- Flaming Death is a huge hit!
- P.T! Sh...

817
01:00:10,136 --> 01:00:12,400
<i>- I'm serious. Word of mouth got around.
- P. T..! No!</i>

818
01:00:12,471 --> 01:00:14,962
The next day, there was a line of flies
outside the tent went on forever!

819
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:16,975
<i>- It must have been a foot long!
- P. T., no!</i>

820
01:00:17,043 --> 01:00:20,342
So, I figured it out. You guys burn me
twice a night, I take a day off to heal,

821
01:00:20,413 --> 01:00:22,347
and then we do it
all over again!

822
01:00:22,415 --> 01:00:25,646
We'll be the top circus act
in the business!

823
01:00:25,718 --> 01:00:27,652
You mean, you're not warriors?

824
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:32,748
Are you kiddin'? These guys are the
lousiest circus bugs you've ever seen.

825
01:00:32,825 --> 01:00:35,259
And they're gonna make me rich!

826
01:00:35,328 --> 01:00:38,388
You mean to tell me that
our entire defensive strategy...

827
01:00:38,464 --> 01:00:40,864
was concocted by clowns?

828
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:43,094
Hey, hey, hey, hey. We really thought
Flik's idea was gonna work.

829
01:00:46,739 --> 01:00:49,902
- Oops.
- Tell me this isn't true.

830
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:52,944
- No, you don't... You don't...
- This couldn't have happened
at a more inopportune time!

831
01:00:53,012 --> 01:00:54,946
The last leaf is about to fall!

832
01:00:55,014 --> 01:00:57,312
<i> We haven't collected
any food for the grasshoppers!</i>

833
01:00:57,383 --> 01:00:59,613
<i>If Hopper finds out
what we almost did...</i>

834
01:00:59,685 --> 01:01:02,813
<i>Hopper is not going
to find out.</i>

835
01:01:02,888 --> 01:01:06,346
We're going to hide all this,
and pretend it never happened.

836
01:01:06,425 --> 01:01:10,328
You bugs were never here.
So I suggest you all leave.

837
01:01:10,397 --> 01:01:12,957
But the bird!
The-The bird will work.

838
01:01:13,033 --> 01:01:17,265
I never thought I'd see the day
when an ant would put himself...

839
01:01:17,337 --> 01:01:20,397
<i>- before the rest ofhis colony.
- What?</i>

840
01:01:20,474 --> 01:01:24,035
- The point is, Flik, you lied to us.
- No, no, no! I-I...

841
01:01:24,111 --> 01:01:26,875
You lied, Flik. You lied to her.

842
01:01:26,947 --> 01:01:30,542
<i>You lied to the colony!
You lied to me!</i>

843
01:01:30,617 --> 01:01:32,812
And like an idiot,
I believed you.

844
01:01:32,886 --> 01:01:36,549
But I-I was just afraid that...

845
01:01:36,623 --> 01:01:40,821
if you knew I'd gotten circus bugs...

846
01:01:40,894 --> 01:01:45,388
<i>- I just wanted to make a difference.
- I want you to leave, Flik.</i>

847
01:01:45,465 --> 01:01:48,901
And this time, don't come back.

848
01:01:59,546 --> 01:02:02,674
Tough crowd. Yee-haw!

849
01:02:02,749 --> 01:02:05,115
Flik!

850
01:02:30,945 --> 01:02:34,039
<i>Get those bugs!</i>

851
01:02:58,105 --> 01:03:01,006
That's it? But there's got
to be more food on the island!

852
01:03:01,075 --> 01:03:03,009
If we give up any more,
we'll starve.

853
01:03:03,077 --> 01:03:05,637
Hopper won't accept this!

854
01:03:11,052 --> 01:03:13,987
Mother, it's not enough.

855
01:03:14,055 --> 01:03:16,523
- What do we do?
- I-I don't know.

856
01:03:46,655 --> 01:03:49,681
You little termites!

857
01:03:49,758 --> 01:03:53,592
I give you a second chance,
and this is all I get?

858
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:57,860
But Hopper, we ran out of time!

859
01:03:57,933 --> 01:04:01,699
Have you been playing all summer?
You think this is a game?

860
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:05,206
- No, no, please!
- Well, guess what?

861
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,242
You just lost.

862
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:10,904
Not one ant sleeps...

863
01:04:10,979 --> 01:04:14,346
until we get
every scrap of food...

864
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:16,782
on this island!

865
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:19,821
Just do what he says. You don't
want to make him mad. Believe me!

866
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:24,821
No, no, no.
You're staying with me, Your Highness.

867
01:04:24,893 --> 01:04:26,884
What do you think you're doing?

868
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:30,792
- Get over there.
- Quick! To the clubhouse.

869
01:04:36,338 --> 01:04:38,636
Hurry!

870
01:04:47,482 --> 01:04:49,882
<i>Shut up a minute, will ya?</i>

871
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:53,285
<i>- I think I heard something over here.
- Have you checked over there?</i>

872
01:04:53,355 --> 01:04:57,258
- No, not yet.
- Then get over there and check it out!

873
01:04:57,327 --> 01:04:59,420
Wait a minute.

874
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:02,760
Hey, I think I found something.

875
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:07,302
Cool. Hey, how do I look?

876
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:09,304
Like an idiot.

877
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,306
Oh, I don't know, maybe
it'll keep me dry in the rain.

878
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:14,343
You moron, we'll be out of here
before it rains.

879
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,345
Didn't you hear Hopper?
After the ants pick all the food,

880
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,711
<i>he's gonna squish the queen
to remind 'em who's boss.</i>

881
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:23,650
<i>Then she's dead. They cry... boo-hoo...
we go home. End of story.</i>

882
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,951
Oh! Cool. I love our job.

883
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:30,049
Stay here.
I'm gonna get help.

884
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:17,634
Come on, wings, fly. Fly!

885
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:52,208
# I'm gonna be
rich, rich, rich #

886
01:06:52,276 --> 01:06:56,372
# I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich
I'm gonna be the richest flea
in the land #

887
01:06:56,447 --> 01:07:01,316
Ka-ching! #The streets'll
be paved with golden retrievers #

888
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:03,717
<i>#I'm rich, rich, rich
That's who I am ##</i>

889
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:11,289
- Poor fellow.
- Hey, maybe we can cheer him up a bit.

890
01:07:12,663 --> 01:07:16,827
Don't worry, Flik.
The circus life isn't so bad.

891
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,494
- Yes, you can be part of our act.
- Here! Like this.

892
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:24,166
Oof! Ahh.
Slapstick! Get it?

893
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:28,645
<i>I- I'm a walkingstick.
 Oh, never mind.</i>

894
01:07:28,713 --> 01:07:30,647
<i>- Flik!
- Dot?</i>

895
01:07:30,715 --> 01:07:33,650
Flik, wait! Wait!

896
01:07:33,718 --> 01:07:36,846
Dot, you're flying!
What are you doing here?

897
01:07:36,921 --> 01:07:39,151
You... have to go back.

898
01:07:39,224 --> 01:07:41,158
Hopper moved into the anthill,

899
01:07:41,226 --> 01:07:43,251
and his gang's eating everything!

900
01:07:43,328 --> 01:07:45,262
- Oh, no!
- Good heavens!

901
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:47,662
And I heard a grasshopper say
that when they're finished,

902
01:07:47,732 --> 01:07:49,825
Hopper's gonna squish my mom!

903
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:52,529
- Oh, not the queen!
- Do something!
- How?

904
01:07:52,604 --> 01:07:55,801
<i>- Come on, you guys, think!
- I know. The bird.</i>

905
01:07:55,874 --> 01:07:57,933
- Yes, of course.
- The bird! That's brilliant.

906
01:07:58,009 --> 01:08:01,501
<i>- Ja!
- The bird won't work.</i>

907
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:03,979
- What are you talking about?
It was your idea.
- But you said that everything...

908
01:08:04,048 --> 01:08:06,676
Forget everything I ever told you.
All right, Dot?

909
01:08:06,751 --> 01:08:10,983
<i>Let's face it. The colony is right.
I just make things worse.</i>

910
01:08:11,055 --> 01:08:14,252
That bird is a guaranteed failure.

911
01:08:14,325 --> 01:08:16,486
Just like me.

912
01:08:16,561 --> 01:08:21,123
You listen to me, my boy. I've made
a living out of being a failure.

913
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:23,326
<i>And you, sir, are not a failure!</i>

914
01:08:23,401 --> 01:08:26,461
- Oh, but Flik, you've
done so many good things.
- Oh, yeah?

915
01:08:26,538 --> 01:08:28,472
Okay, show me one thing
I've done right.

916
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:32,408
- Umm...
- Us.

917
01:08:32,477 --> 01:08:34,968
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Dim is right, my boy.</i>

918
01:08:35,046 --> 01:08:39,983
You have rekindled the long-dormant
embers of purpose in our lives.

919
01:08:40,051 --> 01:08:44,010
And if it wasn't for you,
Francis would have never gotten
in touch with his feminine side.

920
01:08:44,088 --> 01:08:46,148
Oh yeah? Well... Hmm.

921
01:08:46,225 --> 01:08:48,159
You know what? He's right.

922
01:08:48,227 --> 01:08:50,821
Lieutenant Gypsy
reporting for duty.

923
01:08:50,896 --> 01:08:54,832
- Kid, say the word
and we'll follow you into battle.
- We believe in you, my boy.

924
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,891
Flik, please?

925
01:09:22,461 --> 01:09:24,725
Pretend it's a seed, okay?

926
01:09:29,735 --> 01:09:32,795
Thanks, Dot.

927
01:09:37,543 --> 01:09:40,512
- Hey, what's with the rock?
- Must be an ant thing.

928
01:09:40,579 --> 01:09:43,275
All right, let's do it.

929
01:09:43,349 --> 01:09:45,283
That's the Flik we know and love.

930
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:47,342
- We're on!
- So, what do we do first?

931
01:09:48,988 --> 01:09:51,923
# Bugs will pay
big bucks to see #

932
01:09:51,991 --> 01:09:54,926
#A bonfire that is starring me ##

933
01:09:54,994 --> 01:09:57,121
P.T., look. Money!

934
01:09:57,196 --> 01:09:59,027
<i>Where? Where? </i>

935
01:10:01,568 --> 01:10:06,801
All right. Get movin'! Get goin'.
Move your abdomens, now!

936
01:10:06,873 --> 01:10:08,807
<i>They're rounding everyone up.</i>

937
01:10:10,076 --> 01:10:12,010
Hey! Turn your butt off.

938
01:10:14,047 --> 01:10:15,947
Psst! Hey, guys!
Get me out of this thing, will ya?

939
01:10:16,016 --> 01:10:17,950
I promise to start thinkin'
about payin' ya.

940
01:10:18,018 --> 01:10:20,714
<i>Hey! Wait, wait!
Okay, I'll pay ya! I'll pay ya!</i>

941
01:10:20,787 --> 01:10:24,052
<i> Oh, no!
They've finished collecting the food.</i>

942
01:10:24,124 --> 01:10:26,319
<i>We've got to get the queen now.</i>

943
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:29,021
Once she's safe,
we move on Gypsy's signal.

944
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:36,567
Someone's coming!

945
01:10:38,705 --> 01:10:42,106
Hello, kids! Ready to make
some grasshoppers cry?

946
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:45,144
It's payback time,
Blueberry-style.

947
01:10:45,211 --> 01:10:47,145
Blueberries rock!

948
01:10:47,213 --> 01:10:48,976
All right!

949
01:10:51,217 --> 01:10:54,914
<i> Ladies and Gentlebugs!
Larvae of all stages!</i>

950
01:10:54,988 --> 01:10:59,357
<i>Rub your legs together for
the world's greatest bug circus!</i>

951
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:13,371
Wait a minute.

952
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,706
- I think I'm going to wet myself.
- Steady...

953
01:11:16,777 --> 01:11:19,712
- What's going on here?
- Well, uh...

954
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,714
<i>Uh, yes.</i>

955
01:11:21,782 --> 01:11:24,410
We were invited
by Princess Atta...

956
01:11:24,485 --> 01:11:27,852
<i>as a surprise for your arrival.</i>

957
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:29,947
Squish 'em.

958
01:11:31,192 --> 01:11:33,387
Ooh...

959
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:38,631
Hey!

960
01:11:47,942 --> 01:11:49,876
<i>Now that's funny.</i>

961
01:11:49,944 --> 01:11:51,809
<i>That is funny.</i>

962
01:11:53,614 --> 01:11:56,310
I guess we could use
a little entertainment.

963
01:11:56,384 --> 01:11:59,444
Looks like you did something right
for once, Princess.

964
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,479
- On with the show!
- Hi-ya!

965
01:12:03,557 --> 01:12:05,650
Hey!

966
01:12:05,726 --> 01:12:08,820
#The circus, the circus
I love the circus #

967
01:12:21,242 --> 01:12:23,972
Ba-ba all gone!

968
01:12:24,045 --> 01:12:26,343
Baby wants pie!

969
01:12:26,414 --> 01:12:30,282
Pie? He asked for it.
Should I give it to him?

970
01:12:30,351 --> 01:12:33,412
Yeah! Give 'em pie!
Give 'em pie!

971
01:12:33,488 --> 01:12:35,786
Yeah! Hah!

972
01:12:35,857 --> 01:12:37,984
Thank you, gentlemen.
Always an intellectual treat.

973
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,688
Say, how many roaches does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

974
01:12:40,762 --> 01:12:43,196
Can't tell. As soon as
the light goes on, they scatter!

975
01:12:57,712 --> 01:12:59,942
Ah, almost there.

976
01:13:00,015 --> 01:13:03,644
From the most mysterious
regions of uncharted Asia,

977
01:13:03,718 --> 01:13:06,380
<i>- I give you the Chinese Cabinet...
- Come on, girls. Quick. Quick.</i>

978
01:13:06,455 --> 01:13:09,583
<i>Of Metamorphosis!</i>

979
01:13:09,658 --> 01:13:12,218
Utilizing psychic vibrations,

980
01:13:12,294 --> 01:13:15,923
- Ooh, ohh, pick me!
- I shall select the perfect volunteer.

981
01:13:15,997 --> 01:13:18,727
Ooh, no! Come on,
I'm askin' ya with my brain.

982
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,736
- Aha! Why, Your Majesty!
- Me?

983
01:13:22,804 --> 01:13:25,500
No, no. Thumper, down. Let her go.

984
01:13:25,574 --> 01:13:27,508
Maybe he'll saw her in half.

985
01:13:27,576 --> 01:13:31,273
As you ascend the dung beetle
to the unknown,

986
01:13:31,346 --> 01:13:35,476
put your trust in the mysteries that
are beyond mere mortal comprehension.

987
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:38,314
Ooh, this is gonna be good!

988
01:13:40,122 --> 01:13:42,090
- Blueberries ready?
- Ready.

989
01:13:42,157 --> 01:13:44,717
- Ready!
- Shh!

990
01:13:44,793 --> 01:13:47,853
I call upon the ancient
Szechwan spirits...

991
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:50,990
<i>to inhabit the body
of our volunteer!</i>

992
01:13:51,067 --> 01:13:53,535
No, no.
Just stay in there, Your Majesty.

993
01:13:53,603 --> 01:13:55,833
Transformation.

994
01:13:55,905 --> 01:13:58,396
Transformation!

995
01:13:58,474 --> 01:14:00,567
<i>Transformation!</i>

996
01:14:00,643 --> 01:14:02,838
Wow.
Manny's gettin' good.

997
01:14:02,912 --> 01:14:06,370
- Not now.
- If it rains, that bird'll
get ripped to shreds!

998
01:14:10,953 --> 01:14:14,719
<i>And now, insectus...</i>

999
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:18,123
<i>transformitus!</i>

1000
01:14:24,433 --> 01:14:26,424
Ooh, pretty!

1001
01:14:26,502 --> 01:14:30,097
Thank you, thank you.

1002
01:14:30,173 --> 01:14:33,074
<i>- Thank you.
- That's the signal. That's the signal!</i>

1003
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:38,977
This is it, girls.
Get ready to roll.

1004
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:44,112
- Huh? It's stuck!
- That was amazing!

1005
01:14:44,187 --> 01:14:48,146
I have no... How did they do that?
I have no idea where she went.

1006
01:14:48,224 --> 01:14:50,715
<i>- Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
- More, more, more!</i>

1007
01:14:50,793 --> 01:14:53,626
Wait!

1008
01:14:53,696 --> 01:14:56,563
- Where is she?
- Well, now, uh, actually...

1009
01:14:56,632 --> 01:15:00,500
I am sorry. A magician
never reveals his secrets.

1010
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:03,505
That's very true, Hoppy. Where would the
mystery be if we all knew how it was...

1011
01:15:03,573 --> 01:15:06,042
Shutting up.

1012
01:15:06,109 --> 01:15:09,408
- You can do it!
You've got to make it work!
- Hey!

1013
01:15:10,747 --> 01:15:12,840
I said, where is she?

1014
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:15,146
Ohh!

1015
01:15:22,593 --> 01:15:24,584
Hold on!

1016
01:15:34,004 --> 01:15:36,336
Bird! It's a bird!

1017
01:15:53,357 --> 01:15:57,623
Let's get out of here! Go!

1018
01:16:02,032 --> 01:16:06,059
Don't let it get me!
Don't let it get me!

1019
01:16:06,136 --> 01:16:08,070
Help me! Aaah!

1020
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,174
<i>Up, down, up, down.</i>

1021
01:16:12,242 --> 01:16:15,143
And turn!

1022
01:16:25,823 --> 01:16:28,883
Oh, my eye! Help me!

1023
01:16:33,765 --> 01:16:35,926
Mmm, boysenberry.

1024
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,027
Huh?
Aah, no, no, no, no, no!

1025
01:16:43,975 --> 01:16:48,742
Oh, the pain!

1026
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,247
There goes my magic act!

1027
01:16:52,317 --> 01:16:55,343
- Flaming gas!
- No! P.T!

1028
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:03,123
A direct hit! Ah-hee-ha!

1029
01:17:03,194 --> 01:17:05,128
Run!

1030
01:17:05,196 --> 01:17:07,790
Flik! Help us!

1031
01:17:27,819 --> 01:17:29,218
Dot!

1032
01:17:31,556 --> 01:17:33,888
Okay! Everyone out! Hurry!

1033
01:17:36,561 --> 01:17:38,496
Where's Dot?
Anyone seen Dot?

1034
01:17:40,232 --> 01:17:44,566
Whose idea was this?

1035
01:17:44,636 --> 01:17:46,570
Huh?

1036
01:17:48,006 --> 01:17:50,270
Was it yours, Princess?

1037
01:17:50,342 --> 01:17:53,004
Just get behind me, girls.
It'll be okay.

1038
01:17:53,078 --> 01:17:55,012
<i>Leave her alone, Hopper.</i>

1039
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:59,107
The bird was my idea.
I'm the one you want.

1040
01:18:12,331 --> 01:18:14,322
Ohh.

1041
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:20,670
Where do you get the gall
to do this to me?

1042
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:24,539
You were...
You were gonna squish the queen.

1043
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:27,204
It's true.

1044
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:30,009
I hate it when someone
gives away the ending.

1045
01:18:32,084 --> 01:18:35,485
You piece of dirt!
No, I'm wrong.

1046
01:18:35,554 --> 01:18:38,546
You're lower than dirt.
You're an ant!

1047
01:18:39,691 --> 01:18:43,218
<i>Let this be a lesson
to all you ants.</i>

1048
01:18:43,295 --> 01:18:46,458
Ideas are very dangerous things.

1049
01:18:46,532 --> 01:18:49,990
<i>You are mindless,
soil-shoving losers,</i>

1050
01:18:50,068 --> 01:18:54,062
put on this earth to serve us!

1051
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:57,007
<i>You're wrong, Hopper.</i>

1052
01:19:03,147 --> 01:19:08,278
Ants are not meant
to serve grasshoppers!

1053
01:19:12,056 --> 01:19:15,321
I've seen these ants
do great things.

1054
01:19:15,393 --> 01:19:17,861
And year after year,
they somehow manage...

1055
01:19:17,929 --> 01:19:21,490
<i>to pick food
for themselves and you.</i>

1056
01:19:24,235 --> 01:19:26,669
<i>So-So who is the weaker species?</i>

1057
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:30,232
Ants don't serve grasshoppers.

1058
01:19:30,308 --> 01:19:33,106
<i>It's you who need us.</i>

1059
01:19:38,683 --> 01:19:41,846
We're a lot stronger
than you say we are.

1060
01:19:41,919 --> 01:19:45,150
And you know it, don't you?

1061
01:19:54,432 --> 01:19:57,367
Well, Princess!

1062
01:19:57,435 --> 01:20:00,199
Umm, Hopper?
I hate to interrupt, but, um...

1063
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:08,777
You ants stay back!

1064
01:20:14,553 --> 01:20:17,716
<i>- Oh, this was such a bad idea!
- You see, Hopper,</i>

1065
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:20,520
nature has a certain order.

1066
01:20:20,592 --> 01:20:24,653
<i>The ants pick the food,
the ants keep the food,</i>

1067
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:26,960
and the grasshoppers leave!

1068
01:20:32,304 --> 01:20:35,705
- I'm so proud of you, Flik!
- Charge-a!

1069
01:20:35,774 --> 01:20:37,935
Where are you going?
They're just ants!

1070
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:40,069
Oof!

1071
01:20:43,482 --> 01:20:46,315
No! Bad grasshopper!
Bad grasshopper! Go home!

1072
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:53,648
Yeah!

1073
01:20:53,725 --> 01:20:57,320
<i> Come back here,
you cowards! Don't leave!</i>

1074
01:20:57,396 --> 01:20:59,523
- To the cannon!
- To the cannon!

1075
01:20:59,598 --> 01:21:02,226
No!

1076
01:21:11,143 --> 01:21:12,838
Happy landings, Hopper!

1077
01:21:14,146 --> 01:21:16,080
Huh?

1078
01:21:24,089 --> 01:21:27,082
Rain!

1079
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:56,050
- Flik!
- Quick! After them!

1080
01:21:56,122 --> 01:21:58,454
- Yaah!
- Aah! Aah!

1081
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,096
Aah! Slim!

1082
01:22:10,169 --> 01:22:12,637
<i>- Francis! Francis! Francis, I'm stuck!
- Where are ya?</i>

1083
01:22:12,705 --> 01:22:14,639
<i>- I'm over here! Here!
- Where?</i>

1084
01:22:14,707 --> 01:22:16,971
<i>I'm the only stick with eyeballs!</i>

1085
01:22:20,179 --> 01:22:22,875
- Help! Help!
- Get him!

1086
01:22:29,255 --> 01:22:32,691
Yes! Yes!

1087
01:22:35,828 --> 01:22:37,455
No!

1088
01:22:49,944 --> 01:22:54,313
- Go that way! I've got an idea!
- But the anthill's over...

1089
01:22:59,753 --> 01:23:01,687
- Flik!
- Come on!

1090
01:23:07,094 --> 01:23:09,358
There!

1091
01:23:12,733 --> 01:23:14,667
Come on!
We've gotta hide!

1092
01:23:14,735 --> 01:23:17,670
No matter what happens,
stay down!

1093
01:23:17,738 --> 01:23:19,672
Flik, no!
What are you doing?

1094
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:24,200
- Uh... Hopper!
- You think it's over?

1095
01:23:24,278 --> 01:23:26,212
No, no, no.
No, I-I can explain.

1096
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,716
- All your little stunt did
was buy them time!
- No, please!

1097
01:23:29,783 --> 01:23:31,216
Please, Hopper!

1098
01:23:31,285 --> 01:23:34,311
I'll get more grasshoppers
and be back next season,

1099
01:23:34,388 --> 01:23:36,618
but you won't!

1100
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,388
Well, what's this?

1101
01:23:42,429 --> 01:23:44,829
Another one of
your little bird tricks?

1102
01:23:44,898 --> 01:23:48,334
- Yup.
- Are there a bunch of little
girls in this one too?

1103
01:23:48,402 --> 01:23:50,870
Hello, girls!

1104
01:23:59,848 --> 01:24:02,009
<i>No! No!
No, no, no, no!</i>

1105
01:24:02,083 --> 01:24:06,383
No! Aah!
No!

1106
01:24:06,454 --> 01:24:09,389
Oh, no!

1107
01:24:09,457 --> 01:24:13,826
<i>Oh, no! No, no, no!</i>

1108
01:24:23,338 --> 01:24:25,568
Come on, boys!

1109
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:28,074
Hey, Princess Dot! Wait up!

1110
01:24:30,945 --> 01:24:33,209
I finally get a second to relax,

1111
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:35,215
and I gotta get out of my chair.

1112
01:24:35,283 --> 01:24:39,447
- Come on! You can rub lotion
on me later, shade boy.
- Yeah, hubba-hubba.

1113
01:24:41,556 --> 01:24:45,549
Oh, thank you!

1114
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:47,891
- Oh, you're too kind!
- It was the least we could do.
All in a day's work.

1115
01:24:47,962 --> 01:24:49,896
Dim!

1116
01:24:49,964 --> 01:24:52,159
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

1117
01:24:52,233 --> 01:24:54,633
I'm so sorry, kids.
I wish you could come along too.

1118
01:24:54,703 --> 01:24:57,171
I'm not gonna cry. I'm not gonna cry.

1119
01:25:05,547 --> 01:25:07,913
Hey, let's go. We got a schedule
to keep. Come on, let's go.

1120
01:25:07,982 --> 01:25:10,246
- Hup, hup, hey!
- Hey, Tiny!
Let's get this show packed up!

1121
01:25:10,318 --> 01:25:12,252
We got paying customers hatching!

1122
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,585
Yes, Mr. Flea. Yes, sir.
Of course, sir. Right away, sir.

1123
01:25:14,657 --> 01:25:16,591
And, um, I just wanted to
thank you for giving me a chance,

1124
01:25:16,659 --> 01:25:19,150
because it's an honor to work
with creative giants such as yourself.

1125
01:25:19,228 --> 01:25:22,755
<i>- Shutting up.
- You sure you can't
come on tour with us?</i>

1126
01:25:22,832 --> 01:25:27,394
- Sorry. My place is here.
- Good answer.

1127
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:30,667
Oh, well. Your loss.
One minute, insects!

1128
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:34,275
I wanna thank all of you...

1129
01:25:34,343 --> 01:25:38,939
for giving us back our hope,
our dignity, and our lives.

1130
01:25:39,048 --> 01:25:43,212
And to you, Princess Atta.
You have given us so much.

1131
01:25:43,252 --> 01:25:46,380
Please accept this gift
from us bugs...

1132
01:25:46,455 --> 01:25:49,185
to you ants.

1133
01:25:49,258 --> 01:25:54,286
- For you!
- Oh! It's a rock.

1134
01:25:54,363 --> 01:25:56,831
What's with the rock?

1135
01:25:56,899 --> 01:25:58,833
Must be a circus thing.

1136
01:26:01,137 --> 01:26:03,503
Well, Flik, you really goofed up.

1137
01:26:03,572 --> 01:26:07,508
- Thanks.
- Yeah, you too.

1138
01:26:44,214 --> 01:26:48,344
- All right.
Now it's gettin' mushy.

1139
01:26:48,418 --> 01:26:51,683
We're outta here! Hy-aah!

1140
01:26:57,527 --> 01:27:01,054
- Whoa!
- See ya next season!

1141
01:27:01,131 --> 01:27:03,691
- See ya, Flik!
- Bye! We miss you already!

1142
01:27:03,767 --> 01:27:07,100
- You fired!
- We forgot Heimlich!

1143
01:27:10,574 --> 01:27:15,602
I'm finished! Finally,
I'm a beautiful butterfly!

1144
01:27:22,352 --> 01:27:25,344
<i>Mein wings!
Oh, they're beautiful!</i>

1145
01:27:25,422 --> 01:27:28,687
Heimlich! The wagon's
taking off! You better start flying!

1146
01:27:28,758 --> 01:27:34,287
<i>But I am flying! And from way up here,
you all look like little ants!</i>

1147
01:27:34,364 --> 01:27:36,958
Auf Wiedersehen!

1148
01:27:37,033 --> 01:27:38,830
Bye!

1149
01:27:45,675 --> 01:27:48,770
Present stalks!

1150
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:51,906
Harvester, salute!

No, no. Do it again. I'm fine.

- Yes!

1180
01:30:23,403 --> 01:30:27,203
This is the 15th take.
I cannot work like this.

1181
01:30:27,273 --> 01:30:30,640
- I will be in my trailer.
- I need a break.

Marker.

Whoa, Flik honey, we are not about to...

1184
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:37,949
Is someone hammering?

1185

Could we hold the work, please? People?

1186

1192
01:30:57,503 --> 01:31:00,131
Why go back to Ant Island at all?

1193
01:31:00,206 --> 01:31:02,140
- I mean, you don't even like grain.
- What?

1194
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:04,142
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

1195
