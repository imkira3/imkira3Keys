line by the explosion.

931
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:27,130
- So...
- So why did it skip you, right?

932
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:30,597
How do we know that this isn't
exactly what was meant to happen?

933
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:34,605
That out of everyone on Flight 180,
you, me and Carter were meant to live.

934
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:38,145
Maybe that was the
design all along.

935
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:41,687
- Or you could still be next.
- Shut up, Carter.

936
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,234
What? I didn't
make up the rules.

937
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:46,900
Somebody's gotta intervene
before death can skip them.

938
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:50,321
Alex proved that three times.
In the plane, with me, you.

939
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:53,661
For all I know, it could circle
back and get us all again.

940
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:59,375
But I am the safest fucker in the
world because you're still next.

[CLEAR] Can we just stop
talking about this?

943
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,547
Let's figure out what
we're gonna do tomorrow.

[ALEX GASPING]

945
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:26,398
I'm gonna meet you
back at the hotel.

946
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:29,568
- Just wait, I'll go with you.
- No, just stay here.

947
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,361
Okay, Clear?
Just stay here.

948
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:32,620
All right?

949
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:35,578
See, it's true.
I told you you were next, man.

950
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:36,787
Stop it, Carter.

951
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:39,419
- [CLEAR] Alex, wait.
- No, Clear, stay there.

952
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:42,421
Okay?
Stay away.

Alex!

956
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:16,080
I told you, you were next.

957
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:19,451
- Then it just skipped me.
- So who's next?
