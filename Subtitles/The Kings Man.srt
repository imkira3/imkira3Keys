2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

3
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,752
Your Grace.

4
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:12,549
Sergeant, I'm here on behalf
of the Red Cross...

5
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,510
and I'd like to speak with General Kitchener.

6
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,345
There is no General Kitchener here.

7
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,513
Your Grace?

8
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,972
Your Grace? Let him in.

9
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,601
Well, if Morton's here,
then Kitchener can't be far away.

10
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:26,146
My apologies, Your Grace.
Security's paramount right now.

11
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,357
It's a secret
that you're visiting with the general.

12
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:31,652
We can't be too careful with these Boers
and their guerilla tactics.

13
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,861
Too careful?

14
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,531
Looks like this place could use
a lot more care.

15
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,698
Begging your pardon, sir...

16
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,493
but these concentration camps
are the reason we're winning this war.

17
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,786
This way.

18
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:49,378
Orlando. Our knight in shining armor.

19
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,421
Thank you for coming.

20
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,507
What's going on, Kitchener?

21
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,010
It seems that you've been
somewhat liberal with the truth.

22
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,388
Time has not been kind here.

23
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,223
Well, you'll have to explain that to Emily.

24
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,976
On my return to England,
it will be my first port of call.

25
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,310
She's outside...

26
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,187
<i>with Conrad.</i>

27
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,023
Why are we here, Mother?

28
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:15,028
Do you remember why King Arthur
and his knights had a round table?

29
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,157
Because it meant that all men were equal.

30
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,912
It's important that people
born into privilege lead by example.

31
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,165
That's why your father and I
are patrons of the Red Cross.

32
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,543
Helping others...

33
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,421
not hiding behind our status.

34
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,886
Never forget that.

35
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,809
I'm just going to check on your father.

36
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,522
Stay here, Conrad.

37
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,530
This terrible war would be over, Shola...

38
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,410
if King Arthur and his noble knights
were still here.

39
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,371
Of course. And which one would you be?

40
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,707
I'd be Lancelot.

41
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,835
Father would be Arthur. Mother, Guinevere.

42
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,130
And you, the mighty Merlin.

43
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,298
Really?

44
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,719
This is ridiculous.
We're wasting precious time.

45
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,888
Look around, people are dying.

46
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,015
We have emergency supplies
from the Red Cross.

47
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,725
Thank God she's on our side.

48
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,310
Well, on my side, at least.

49
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,604
She's more of a force
than any of our enemies.

50
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,272
There's General Kitchener.

51
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,859
Well, open the gates!
Bring in those supplies!

52
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,486
Emily!

53
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,661
Lie down until I get back.

54
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,424
Go back to Conrad.

55
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:06,974
Go to hell, Kitchener.

56
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,357
I got him! Stop fire!

57
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,322
Emily!

58
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,117
Cease fire!

59
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:29,997
Emily.

60
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,875
Darling, I'm here.

61
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,339
I'm here. Darling, I'm here.

62
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,135
That's it. I'm here.
You have to stay with me.

63
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,429
You have to stay with me.

64
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:46,638
Darling?

65
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,059
Protect our son.

66
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:56,690
Protect him from this world. And...

67
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,152
Never let him see war again.

68
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,119
Promise me.

69
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,914
I promise.

70
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:52,848
You know, Conrad...

71
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,226
up there, I feel free.

72
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,938
Yes, I'm very much looking forward
to my first solo flight.

73
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,274
Remember what happened to Icarus, Conrad...

74
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,526
when he flew too close to the sun.

75
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,821
Well, I remember him needing to escape, no?

76
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,531
Well, he got burned.

77
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,826
I think we both see that story differently.

78
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,078
-Welcome home, Your Grace.
-Thank you, Shola.

79
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,458
-Afternoon, everyone.
-Afternoon, Your Grace.

80
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,585
Ready for your maiden flight yet, Shola?

81
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:25,297
Well, if God wanted man to fly,
he would have given him wings.

82
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:28,383
Yes, I suppose. You drive Father's car?

83
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,970
You haven't any wheels.

84
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,359
Nanny Watkins.

85
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,696
My study in five minutes.

86
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,368
Your Grace.

87
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,505
Your Grace.

88
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,508
I should be reprimanding you
for your insolence.

89
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,553
Your opinion behind closed doors
is one thing, Polly...

90
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,181
but I will not tolerate such demonstrations
in front of my household.

91
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,518
I'll play by your rules
when you play by mine.

92
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,187
Do you really think
you can keep secrets from me?

93
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,772
What do you mean?

94
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,859
Once again, you've turned down
Cousin Felix's invitation...

95
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,902
for Conrad to stay with him in Russia.

96
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:30,946
And how do you know that?

97
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,532
Us nannies love a good gossip.

98
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,494
And we've all noticed that you've no problem
with Felix traveling here...

99
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,289
but you seem to have a problem
with Conrad traveling there.

100
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,124
Or anywhere, for that matter.

101
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,378
Yeah. Guilty as charged. Well, I'm sorry.

102
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,255
I should have discussed it with you.

103
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:52,050
Has all this flying around in circles
made you forget your manners?

104
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,635
Well, what have I done now?

105
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,387
You haven't even offered me a drink.

106
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,347
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

107
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:02,895
And if we had discussed this,
what would my opinion have been?

108
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,647
You think that my...

109
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,609
fear for Conrad's safety is a weakness.

110
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,569
Fear is natural.

111
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,030
The problem is, the more you fear something,
the more likely it is to come true.

112
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:20,078
So, then, we're both in need of a nanny.

113
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,456
So it would seem.

114
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:37,763
Higher!

115
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,523
Can you fight with only one arm?

116
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,316
Oh, yes.

117
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,902
If I had someone left to fight.

118
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,452
Shola. Do you really think
a knife can beat a bullet?

119
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,247
This is how people are fighting nowadays.

120
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,167
Now, clean yourselves up
before this afternoon's appointment.

121
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,812
My father also brought me here
for my first suit.

122
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,399
Kingsman, world's finest tailor.

123
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,157
Morning.

124
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,242
Your Grace.

125
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,286
Fitting room number one is ready for you.

126
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,954
Thank you.

127
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,250
Well, here we are.

128
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,920
<i>I wish your mother could see you now.</i>

129
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,590
She would've been so proud.

130
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,426
I hope so, Father.

131
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,473
Although, I might get more use
out of a shooting suit or a...

132
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,018
smoking jacket, you know.

133
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:09,438
Whatever might help
in the pursuit of fine birds.

134
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,024
Oh, come on, Father.

135
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,193
It's a big world out there.

136
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,237
Sooner or later, you're going to have to
let me enjoy it, even if...

137
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,823
you know, even if you don't want to.

138
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,410
You know...

139
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,786
Conrad...

140
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:30,375
our ancestors, they were terrible people.

141
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,671
They robbed, lied, pillaged, and killed,
until one day...

142
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,216
they found themselves noblemen.

143
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,676
But that nobility...

144
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,846
it never came from chivalry.

145
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,517
It came from being tough and ruthless.

146
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,438
Back then, to be called a "gentleman"...

147
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,482
would have been a death sentence.

148
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:59,363
Not the mark of honor it is today.

149
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,448
We are Oxfords...

150
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,159
not rogues.

151
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:07,996
<i>Oxford!</i>

152
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,414
Kitchener.

153
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,417
Well, so glad we share the same tailor.

154
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,963
Indeed. Well, the Kingsman clientele
is enough to make any club envious.

155
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,091
Oxford, can I borrow you for a moment?

156
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:20,634
Is there somewhere private?

157
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,594
May I suggest the pattern room upstairs, sir.

158
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:23,971
Perfect.

159
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,932
Conrad, this is Morton, my aide-de-camp.

160
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,601
Morton, look after young Conrad for us,
will you?

161
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,103
It will be my pleasure, my lord.

162
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,271
Good.

163
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,618
I gather you turned down our Austrian friend
Archduke Ferdinand's invitation to his shoot.

164
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:53,417
Surely your pacifism doesn't extend
to a few birds, does it?

165
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:57,254
Us bumping into each other here
was no coincidence, was it?

166
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,258
Walls have ears in Whitehall these days.

167
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:05,387
Which is why I felt Kingsman
a safer place for a chat.

168
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:11,143
I'm worried that Ferdinand's political
ambitions may be putting him in danger.

169
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,189
I need you to do me a small favor.

170
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,107
What sort of favor?

171
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,692
So, you're serious about being a soldier?

172
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,860
Oh, yes.

173
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:20,944
Which regiment?

174
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,029
Grenadiers.

175
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,113
Grenadiers. Well...

176
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:27,284
when the time comes, contact me.
I'll see what I can do.

177
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,744
Conrad.

178
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,124
You're going to need
that shooting suit after all.

179
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,796
My Shepherd.

180
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:25,551
I have a Fabergé egg made especially for you.

181
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,511
And look inside.

182
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,473
A little replica of Angus...

183
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,183
your favorite goat.

184
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,351
You're late.

185
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,271
Take a seat.

186
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,942
What is trust?

187
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:47,197
Trust is having confidence...

188
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,241
in the honesty of another.

189
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,828
That will be our weapon...

190
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,914
to change the world.

191
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,333
Who do I trust?

192
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,003
Animals.

193
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,214
They never let me down...

194
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:08,427
and they follow my commands blindly.

195
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,263
The question I now have is...

196
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,893
can I trust you to behave like them?

197
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,312
Open the boxes in front of you.

198
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:26,820
These rings will be the symbol of membership
to my flock.

199
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:31,325
Put them on,
and you will share in our successes.

200
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,492
But...

201
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,453
break my trust...

202
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,247
and inside you will find...

203
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,334
my final gift to you.

204
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,002
A tortoise?

205
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:45,422
Am I not worthy of a better animal?

206
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,425
Rasputin, I have a bear.
I will happily exchange it with you.

207
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,887
Yes, Princip.
I will be the great bear of Russia.

208
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,805
Take what you believe is yours.

209
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,891
And by all means...

210
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,935
treat our Shepherd
with the same respect you hold...

211
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,729
for that joke of a man
who calls himself your tsar.

212
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,191
Go ahead, Rasputin, take it.

213
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,443
I dare you.

214
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,779
Now, now, Mata and Erik. We are...

215
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,030
a team.

216
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,199
And Rasputin here...

217
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,912
is like my beloved Angus.

218
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:21,124
Always butting...

219
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,961
and fucking.

220
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:31,552
But do not mistake fondness for weakness...

221
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:35,013
you late Russian fuckstick!

222
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,016
As everybody knows...

223
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,477
the tortoise...

224
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,189
eventually wins the race.

225
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:53,532
Now...

226
00:17:56,118 --> 00:18:00,706
my spy, or should I say my mole...

227
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:03,375
in the British government...

228
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,880
informs me that
Kitchener is concerned for the safety...

229
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,174
of the Archduke Ferdinand.

230
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:14,511
Princip, my wee bear.

231
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:19,141
Are you ready to prove
Kitchener's concerns are justified?

232
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:22,102
Yes, I am, my Shepherd.
And I will not let you down.

233
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,813
Damn fucking right.

234
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,021
Does that make sense to you, Ferdinand?

235
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,943
Now I understand why you accepted
my shooting invitation.

236
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:15,113
I didn't really believe
Kitchener's scare tactics.

237
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,824
Harping on about my being in danger.

238
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,661
Well, only a fool
ignores a friend's warning, Ferdi.

239
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,204
Is it really too much to ask?

240
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:25,040
I think you should come back with me
and hear what he has to say.

241
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,377
Turning you down is a hard task.

242
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,879
I will give you my decision tonight.

243
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:31,964
Good.

244
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,237
Drive! Drive!

245
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,171
I come here on a visit of goodwill,
to be greeted by bombs?

246
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,382
Yes.

247
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,843
It gives me special pleasure...

248
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,928
I shouldn't have brought you here.

249
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,390
We need to get home, where I can protect you.

250
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:24,558
What...

251
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,227
I just protected you.
I don't need protecting.

252
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,229
Yes, you do, Conrad.

253
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,065
I'm sorry, but you think you know
what the world is like...

254
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:36,153
but the truth is, you're just a boy
who has no idea what men are capable of.

255
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,156
What? Watching my mother die
wasn't a good enough introduction?

256
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,729
Are you sure this is right?

257
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,273
Just follow my orders.

258
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,360
Take the first left.

259
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:30,999
It's a dead end, you fool.

260
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,709
I knew this was the wrong way.

261
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,545
I meant the next left.

262
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,338
Stop arguing. We're sitting ducks here.

263
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,549
Get this car moving now.

264
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,883
Father, it's terrible about Ferdi and Sophie.

265
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:24,469
We're safe now, aren't we?

266
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:26,847
Yes, but for how long?

267
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:30,142
I'm beginning to understand
what Kitchener was so afraid of.

268
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:33,770
Already there are rumors
the Austrians are mobilizing their army.

269
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:37,357
They don't believe
this assassin acted independently.

270
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,693
And neither do I.

271
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,697
It's just Serbia. It's such a small part
of the world. Why do they care?

272
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:48,577
Well, because small things
can grow into big problems.

273
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,748
<i>You see, years ago,
there were three young cousins.</i>

274
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:54,124
<i>The eldest was a real troublemaker...</i>

275
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,292
Put my soldier back!

276
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,668
There are no rules in war.

277
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,504
I'll teach you war, Wilhelm!

278
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,965
<i>-Their grandmother was Queen Victoria...
-</i>Nicholas. Enough!

279
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,383
<i>...who kept them in line.</i>

280
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,054
<i>They grew up to become
Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany...</i>

281
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:11,183
<i>Tsar Nicholas of Russia,
and King George of England.</i>

282
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,771
<i>And now, poor Ferdinand's assassination
has given the moronic kaiser...</i>

283
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:19,233
<i>a reason to reignite their childhood feud.</i>

284
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:24,446
But surely they've matured enough
to avoid a war?

285
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,323
One would hope so.

286
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:31,328
<i>And, thankfully, we have our own King George
to help keep the peace.</i>

287
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,791
There it is.

288
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:43,924
Look at us.

289
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:49,179
Three young cousins
who thought they knew how to rule.

290
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,473
But now the soldiers are real.

291
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,434
Get two copies of this photograph made...

292
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,520
and have them delivered
with these letters immediately.

293
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:58,564
I'll have Morton see to it personally.

294
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,857
Excellent.

295
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,400
Your Majesty.

296
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,949
-Erik.
-My kaiser.

297
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:13,161
"Restraint is a virtue. Remember your duty."

298
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,706
His Majesty, my cousin, the king of England,
strongly suggests we do nothing.

299
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:24,715
Remember how Prince George
used to enjoy it...

300
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:28,177
when your English mother
and her English doctors would torture you?

301
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:30,596
George would tease you about your...

302
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,473
deformities.

303
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,226
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

304
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:39,313
And don't forget
that sniggering at his side...

305
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,315
was your little Russian cousin...

306
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:43,650
<i>Tsar Nicholas.</i>

307
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:46,236
Cousin George is imploring self-restraint
against our other cousin, the moronic kaiser.

308
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:52,618
King George has always
protected our interests.

309
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,370
Why would we go to war
over something so trivial?

310
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,497
Because we gave Serbia our word.

311
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,666
And besides, I hate the kaiser.

312
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:03,962
It will be good for his oversized ego
to match his undersized hand.

313
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:08,675
A wise decision, my tsar.

314
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:12,679
The soul of Russia is safe in your hands.

315
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:15,891
<i>The world will laugh at you...</i>

316
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:19,728
for not keeping your word
and standing by the Austrians.

317
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,606
Ignore the English king.

318
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:25,859
Tell George to mind his own business, <i>ja?</i>

319
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:33,700
If I want a war, then I will have it.

320
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:39,414
As Russia's ally, we have no choice
but to join this war.

321
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,042
I don't understand. The kaiser and the tsar
have both ignored the king's wishes. Why?

322
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:45,504
That's a good question.

323
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,756
With all due respect, sir...

324
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:49,800
this debate should happen
after we have won the war.

325
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,134
The prime minister is waiting.

326
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:52,678
And we're late.

327
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:54,054
Morton's right.

328
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:57,307
My lord, it would be my honor to volunteer.

329
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,061
-Honor?
-Fine words, young Conrad.

330
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:02,980
But therein lies the problem.

331
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:05,983
Legally, you're not old enough to join up.

332
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:11,363
But still young enough to believe it's an
honorable thing to die for one's country.

333
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:15,909
The object of war
is not to die for one's country...

334
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:19,246
but to make the enemy die for theirs.

335
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:30,007
Fix bayonets!

336
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:04,333
<i>Not even I could have imagined
a war like this.</i>

337
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:09,671
<i>What I thought would take a decade
for us to achieve...</i>

338
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:14,968
<i>has taken two short years.</i>

339
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:23,185
<i>We have drained Europe's resources...</i>

340
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:27,814
<i>and millions have died pointlessly.</i>

341
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,441
Fire!

342
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:35,614
We have broken the trust
between the people and the inbred monarchs...

343
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:39,535
who only rule due to their fortunate birth.

344
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:45,749
Do you know who hates King George
more than the kaiser?

345
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:48,627
Me.

346
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:51,672
The English monarchy...

347
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,552
has oppressed my beloved Scotland
for over 700 years...

348
00:27:56,718 --> 00:28:00,055
and it is time for retribution.

349
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:04,017
We will pull Russia out of our war...

350
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:10,315
and unleash the full might of Germany
to destroy England.

351
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:12,526
Rasputin...

352
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:17,739
are you ready to begin
the demise of King George?

353
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,576
Thy will be done, my Shepherd.

354
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,752
{\an8}-They've started conscription.
-Yes, I'm well aware of that, Conrad.

355
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:32,546
And?

356
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:35,299
Well, it was bad enough
I didn't join when it was voluntary...

357
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,926
Conrad, this is not a war. Do you understand?

358
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,761
It's not like any war that we've ever seen.

359
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,763
I don't care! I should be fighting.

360
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:44,433
It's not fighting. It's dying.

361
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,520
Much like this conversation.

362
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:52,232
Tell that to Kitchener.

363
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:09,625
You're still too young, Conrad.

364
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,047
But everyone's lying about their age.
They're all going over.

365
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:16,215
I know.

366
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,300
And I know you want to fight.

367
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:21,345
It's a testament to your character...

368
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:23,055
and I'm proud of you for it.

369
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:24,973
Yes, but look what I was given.

370
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:27,184
In the village.

371
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,229
It's the symbol of a coward.

372
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:32,981
And I should suffer such humiliation?

373
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:37,694
Reputation is what people think of you.

374
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,447
Character is what you are.

375
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,121
Victoria Cross.

376
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,415
Is it yours?

377
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,251
Yes.

378
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:57,214
When I was young,
like you, I wanted to serve my country.

379
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:02,970
<i>But soon I began to question
what right we had...</i>

380
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:06,348
to take the land, riches...

381
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:11,478
and the lives of people
who were only defending their homeland.

382
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:16,608
<i>Every man I killed...</i>

383
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,571
<i>I killed a piece of myself.</i>

384
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:30,414
Maybe having a feather
would have been better.

385
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:36,044
So, the next day, I put down my rifle
and I picked up a stretcher.

386
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:40,632
I should've been given the Cross
for saving lives, not taking them.

387
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,470
As soon as I replace this
with my own medal...

388
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,390
I'll join the medical corps.

389
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:55,022
I have informed Kitchener
of your intention of joining up.

390
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,610
And he has assured me
that he will not let you slip through.

391
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,319
I have a vision.

392
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:47,199
This boy is the symbol of the soul of Russia.

393
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,954
You must save Russia.

394
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:58,168
You must pull out of the war
to save your son's life.

395
00:31:58,335 --> 00:31:59,962
This is nonsense.

396
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:05,342
You dare to question the vessel of the Lord?

397
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:12,432
You dare to risk your son's life?

398
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:16,728
Nicholas, come to your senses now!

399
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:18,647
Please.

400
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:20,858
Please.

401
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:30,367
<i>My dear cousin Conrad.</i>

402
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:33,036
<i>It has been too long
since we last saw each other...</i>

403
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,789
<i>and I'm sorry
I'm only writing to you now, but...</i>

404
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:39,793
<i>in these difficult times,
I'm not sure whom I can trust.</i>

405
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:48,427
Welcome back.

406
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:52,764
<i>For a while now,
I've harbored my suspicions...</i>

407
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:55,726
<i>of this so-called priest, Rasputin.</i>

408
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,520
<i>He has the tsar under his spell...</i>

409
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:01,523
<i>both spiritually and through opium...</i>

410
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:06,528
<i>and has persuaded him
to withdraw from the war.</i>

411
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:12,326
<i>The tsar intends to announce this
in his New Year's speech.</i>

412
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:15,037
Cousin Felix sends his regards.

413
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:19,458
<i>I hope your father's influence can help.</i>

414
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:23,128
Morton, any ideas?

415
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:27,716
Well, sir, in my opinion,
this is a very grave situation.

416
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:29,510
We can trust absolutely no one.

417
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:31,970
I suggest we assemble
an elite squad of men...

418
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:34,723
we go to Russia,
and we sort it out ourselves.

419
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,767
Agreed. See to it immediately.

420
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:41,104
As I'm not allowed to join up,
may I at least go with you?

421
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:45,442
Conrad, you know your father
made me swear that I would...

422
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,570
Protect my son at all costs.

423
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:52,616
Where do you want to go, Conrad?

424
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:55,953
-Russia.
-Why?

425
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,830
To help Cousin Yusupov deal with Rasputin.

426
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:00,958
He's going to force Russia out of the war.

427
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,585
Kitchener, have you killed so many men...

428
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,088
that you're now relying on boys
to run your military intelligence?

429
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:08,549
-How dare you speak to...
-Shut up, Morton.

430
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:12,427
Conrad, we're leaving.

431
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:15,304
Now!

432
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,067
Your lordship?

433
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,821
Let's just hope we don't make
such a mess of things in Russia.

434
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:43,000
One more dispatch box for tonight, sir.

435
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:47,254
Damn it, Morton.
How much do you expect a man to read?

436
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:51,216
I'm terribly sorry, my lord.
I would help, but I'm definitely...

437
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:53,844
definitely more of a soldier
than I am a sailor.

438
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:56,096
Well, go outside, man, and get some air.

439
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:58,182
Quite right.

440
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:04,831
Five million dead.

441
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:07,960
May God forgive me.

442
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:34,695
First Ferdinand, and now Kitchener.
This was not an accident.

443
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:36,321
Kitchener was your friend.

444
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:40,576
Not to mention this country's last hope.
How can you be so calm?

445
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,286
<i>My dear Oxford.</i>

446
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:45,330
<i>I wanted to apologize for our recent fracas.</i>

447
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:48,750
<i>In my opinion, Conrad is a fine young man.</i>

448
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,961
He was betrayed. We must do something.

449
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:53,005
<i>Always ready to face the world.</i>

450
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:55,507
No, don't ignore me, Father.
You know it's true.

451
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,718
You cannot keep running away from problems.

452
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:01,346
<i>But I shall, of course,
respect your wishes...</i>

453
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:04,892
<i>and do everything I can
to keep him out of harm's way.</i>

454
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:08,187
I don't believe it was a German mine.
There is something more afoot.

455
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,649
And what if you're successful?

456
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:15,944
What if you're successful
and keep me locked away as the world burns?

457
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:20,032
<i>If all parents shared your outlook,
there would be no wars.</i>

458
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:25,871
<i>But until that day comes,
I will no doubt be kept busy.</i>

459
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,333
<i>I remain your friend, Kitch.</i>

460
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:35,672
Your incessant need to protect me...

461
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,383
will not redeem your own failure
to protect Mother.

462
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:46,266
I'm sorry, Father.

463
00:37:58,779 --> 00:37:59,780
No, no.

464
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:04,117
I'm sorry.

465
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:10,123
Follow me.

466
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:47,035
Well, about time.

467
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:49,121
Welcome to the club.

468
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:51,498
Is he part of the briefing?

469
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,083
Yes.

470
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,295
Take a look.

471
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:04,803
You see, this war has made me realize...

472
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:09,266
that we cannot rely on politicians
to do their job properly.

473
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,810
So, I decided...

474
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:14,438
that we should do something about it.

475
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:16,565
This isn't making any sense to me, Father.

476
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:17,900
Let me explain.

477
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:22,279
My reputation is of a man
not wanting to be involved...

478
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:28,243
which means that my character finds it
much easier to be involved unnoticed.

479
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,790
Just like domestic servants everywhere
who are seen but not heard.

480
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,126
Essentially invisible.

481
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,588
Unless they're part of the Oxford family,
of course.

482
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:42,966
Shola and Polly have gathered...

483
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:47,596
a network of domestics
such as the world has never seen.

484
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,892
While British intelligence
listens at keyholes...

485
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:56,063
our people are actually in the room.

486
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:57,356
Very clever.

487
00:39:57,856 --> 00:40:00,317
Now, after Ferdinand's assassination...

488
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:03,779
I visited Gavrilo Princip
in his prison in Sarajevo.

489
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:23,549
Thank you.

490
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:29,304
Why did you kill my friend?

491
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,558
It was the alcohol. I was overcome.

492
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:37,020
I'm just a simple Serb.

493
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:41,817
A very expensive ring
for such a simple Serb.

494
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:44,319
And a secret compartment.

495
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:47,823
That smelled of almonds. Therefore, cyanide.

496
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:51,159
Princip's ring proves
he was not acting alone.

497
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:54,288
There is, as you say, Conrad, more afoot.

498
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:55,455
Indeed.

499
00:40:57,124 --> 00:41:00,002
Your cousin's letter made us
extend our network to Russia...

500
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:01,461
and it paid off.

501
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:05,299
The tsar's nanny found a ring
in Rasputin's chambers.

502
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:10,846
Identical to Princip's,
but with a tortoise instead of a bear.

503
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:12,973
Then I think we must
go to Russia immediately...

504
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,809
and find a way to interrogate this monk.

505
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:18,520
But by all accounts, Rasputin is unbreakable.

506
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:22,858
As long as he's alive,
the tsar will never change his mind...

507
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:25,027
and with Russia out of the war...

508
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:27,279
England is doomed.

509
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:28,864
My lord.

510
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:37,164
One life to save millions.

511
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:43,962
So...

512
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:47,925
the only way to honor the vow
I made to your mother...

513
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:52,763
is to break the vow I made to myself.

514
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:56,642
I'm afraid we have no other choice.

515
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:02,856
It is time for us to kill Grigori Rasputin.

516
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,158
Rasputin has accepted an invitation
to your cousin's Christmas ball.

517
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:18,956
The tsar's nanny informs me
of Rasputin's weakness for sweet cakes.

518
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:22,334
And even sweeter boys.

519
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:26,463
So, after the main course is served...

520
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:30,634
Conrad will entice Rasputin...

521
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,637
to a private dessert in the summer room...

522
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:37,432
where nanny's legendary Bakewell tart...

523
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,059
laced with poison...

524
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,019
will be waiting for him.

525
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:43,272
Polly, get baking.

526
00:42:44,273 --> 00:42:46,441
Yes. And don't forget the poison.

527
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:54,408
Get him to eat the cake. Understand?

528
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:55,576
Yes, Father.

529
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:58,287
Good. Tonight we will be rogues...

530
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:00,330
not Oxfords.

531
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,965
Our guest of honor, Father Rasputin.

532
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:57,304
Are you waiters or Englishmen?

533
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:01,600
Whatever you are, get me a fucking drink.

534
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:04,353
Are you a monk or a ballet dancer?

535
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:13,278
I see you've mastered the Beryozka glide.

536
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:17,449
Why don't you glide over there
and get me a fucking drink?

537
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:26,208
Englishmen.

538
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,168
I like the English.

539
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:33,090
But it's a long way to come
for a Christmas party.

540
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:36,218
Well, for me, yes. But not for my son...

541
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:40,722
who is certainly a lot more fun than I am
in these dark days.

542
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,939
I'm looking for someone who can help me
gain an audience with the tsar.

543
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:51,024
Perhaps you can be of assistance.

544
00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:53,610
But I am just a humble monk.

545
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:57,030
A humble monk that this whole room reveres...

546
00:44:57,823 --> 00:44:59,366
or fears.

547
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:10,669
I only make decisions when my stomach is full
or my balls are empty.

548
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:14,089
Well, thank God dinner is being served.

549
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:16,466
So...

550
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:20,679
your father tells me you like to have fun.

551
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:24,558
Yes. I believe I'm sufficiently open-minded.

552
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:28,645
What is it that you Russians do
that an Englishman can enjoy?

553
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:30,814
Well, everything.

554
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:34,151
Food, music, ballet...

555
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,862
tobacco, art.

556
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:38,572
But most of all...

557
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:46,246
we like to fuck like tigers.

558
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:59,968
Is that something an English boy might enjoy?

559
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:03,597
Yes.

560
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:07,559
But tonight I do not want to teach.

561
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:13,023
Change seats with your father.

562
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,945
I'm so sorry if I have offended you.

563
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:21,031
Only if you consider being boring offensive.

564
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:22,950
Now do as you're told.

565
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:25,452
Yes.

566
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:33,460
Sorry, Father. He wants us to swap places.

567
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:42,594
Excuse me, forgive me. Forgive me.

568
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:53,146
This leg is a fearful curse.

569
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:59,361
You know, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say your son was trying to fuck me.

570
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,906
More likely you were trying to fuck him.

571
00:47:03,407 --> 00:47:05,033
Your reputation precedes you.

572
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,453
Well, if you know so much
about my reputation...

573
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:11,290
put your leg in my lap.

574
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:13,500
I may be able to fix it.

575
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:16,044
-Here?
-Not here.

576
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:18,922
Somewhere private, of course.

577
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:27,890
Here we are.

578
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:33,896
You are expecting someone?

579
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:36,064
Yes, our nanny is a wonderful cook...

580
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:40,194
so she's made this cake
as a gift for our host, the prince.

581
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:43,238
Please...

582
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:46,366
take your trousers off and sit down.

583
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,203
Certainly.

584
00:47:49,578 --> 00:47:52,164
I will make the room warm for you.

585
00:47:57,377 --> 00:48:00,714
In summer, I come here
with my young friends.

586
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:04,009
Swim naked in the bathing pond...

587
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:10,015
then come inside
and fuck in front of the fire.

588
00:48:10,474 --> 00:48:11,767
Naturally.

589
00:48:13,143 --> 00:48:14,144
There we are.

590
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,687
Trousers off.

591
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,074
Steady.

592
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:29,451
Blood is life.

593
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:34,039
Its flow is healing.

594
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:38,836
And I can teach it where to flow.

595
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:52,808
Your wound was fixed superficially
and with very poor needle work.

596
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,981
This cake is good, no?

597
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:03,652
Yes. It's Bakewell tart. It's my favorite.

598
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:07,114
We can eat it together
when I put my trousers back on.

599
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:11,326
No. Well, to do this properly...

600
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:14,580
I will need energy.

601
00:49:33,932 --> 00:49:34,933
It's very good.

602
00:49:38,478 --> 00:49:39,646
Very English.

603
00:49:39,813 --> 00:49:41,356
Yes. It's very English.

604
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:11,720
-What's that noise? We should go in.
-No, no.

605
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:15,098
It's Rasputin, not your father.
I think it's the poison killing him.

606
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:33,909
Relax. Let the blood flow.

607
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:35,827
-Let me lick your wounds.
-Yes.

608
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:37,704
-Trust me. Trust me.
-Oh, God.

609
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,414
-Oh, my, I can see it.
-Trust me.

610
00:50:39,581 --> 00:50:42,835
Don't worry, I will help you,
and you will help me.

611
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:47,673
Why do you want to see the tsar?

612
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:52,511
The tsar needs to stay in the war.

613
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:54,596
What makes you think he won't?

614
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:58,934
I'm told he's being influenced.

615
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:00,644
Good. Now we are getting somewhere.

616
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:04,731
So, if you really want your leg fixed,
tell me the truth.

617
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:06,024
Why are you here?

618
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:07,192
I'm here...

619
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,735
-Because?
-Because...

620
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:10,237
-Because?
-Because...

621
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:12,656
-Because?
-Because I'm going to kill...

622
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:27,921
I apologize.

623
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:33,635
Your cake...

624
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:41,018
did not agree with me.

625
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:49,359
Come!

626
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:53,197
We must ice your leg.

627
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:58,994
Only two minutes in the cold water,
and you will be like a new man.

628
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:04,541
-My leg...
-Yes.

629
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,335
-...is healed.
-Yes.

630
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:07,419
Yes.

631
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:09,171
Walk to me.

632
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:12,841
No. No, no, no. Not the cane.

633
00:52:12,925 --> 00:52:13,926
Leave the cane.

634
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:15,886
-Oh, yes.
-Leave the cane.

635
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:18,430
I didn't believe you.

636
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,643
Come to me. Come to me.

637
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:25,938
-Why is Father laughing?
-I have no idea.

638
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:29,399
Now let the cold...

639
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:31,652
Russian water...

640
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:34,363
heal you forever.

641
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:42,913
Come. Come. Come. Come.

642
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,082
Come. Come.

643
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:47,751
-Yes. Yes, yes.
-It's freezing.

644
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:50,128
Let Mother Nature work her magic.

645
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,299
Two minutes.

646
00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:56,635
Two minutes, and you will be healed.

647
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:59,012
You will be healed.

648
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:01,306
Bakewell tart.

649
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:06,061
Tell me, a lot of almonds in Bakewell tart.

650
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:09,940
What other ingredients in Bakewell tart?

651
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:12,401
I have no idea. I'm not a cook.

652
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:13,777
Well, I am.

653
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:18,031
And I also know
what else smells like almonds.

654
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:20,033
Cyanide!

655
00:53:21,243 --> 00:53:23,453
If you really knew my reputation...

656
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,373
you'd know I take a little poison
for breakfast...

657
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,042
-He's in trouble.
-...to keep myself immune.

658
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:39,595
Now, that's more like it.

659
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:46,643
Time to dance... on your graves.

660
00:53:50,189 --> 00:53:52,065
Go and help your father.

661
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:02,409
Father. Father. Oh, God. You're freezing.

662
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:05,204
Father, are you all right? Breathe.

663
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,748
I'm so cold. I'm so cold.

664
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:53,377
Shola.

665
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,620
Shola.

666
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:37,296
Do it.

667
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:38,589
Do it!

668
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:39,715
Do it!

669
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:47,222
Shoot me.

670
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:52,477
Please kill me.

671
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:57,900
Beautiful boy.

672
00:56:26,512 --> 00:56:28,263
I fixed your leg.

673
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:32,226
Which is more than I can say
for your son's neck.

674
00:57:20,899 --> 00:57:23,527
Thank you for my new leg.

675
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:43,005
Are you all right?

676
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,340
I'm fine. Thank you.

677
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:50,220
No. Thank you. You saved my life.

678
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:54,558
And you, mine.

679
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:56,768
What about Shola?

680
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:01,481
He'll be all right.
He just needs to sleep it off.

681
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:21,210
Why is it that boys are always so messy?

682
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:24,713
Pick him up. It's time to go.

683
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:35,724
You have got to be fucking kidding me!

684
00:58:40,103 --> 00:58:44,566
I want you to pick up where Rasputin failed.

685
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:48,946
I don't care about your ideology
or your politics.

686
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:51,532
Just start your fucking revolution...

687
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:54,952
and get Russia out of my war...

688
00:58:55,118 --> 00:58:56,245
Comrade Lenin.

689
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:57,704
Yes, my Shepherd.

690
00:58:57,871 --> 00:58:59,873
When my revolution is complete...

691
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,627
the flocks left will be so powerful...

692
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:08,048
your one problem will be finding my equal
to balance from the right.

693
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:17,474
What's wrong with him?

694
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:21,436
Today your father broke his vow of pacifism.

695
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:23,897
But it was the right thing to do.

696
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:27,442
Right or wrong,
it doesn't make it any easier.

697
00:59:28,986 --> 00:59:33,448
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

698
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:38,161
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

699
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:43,083
<i>Happy birthday, dearest Conrad</i>

700
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:49,840
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

701
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,011
Good boy.

702
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:01,393
To my son.

703
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:05,856
Thank you.

704
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:09,776
Today, you proved yourself a man...

705
01:00:09,943 --> 01:00:13,530
and you've made us all very proud.

706
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:17,743
A toast to our successful mission...

707
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,953
and my new leg.

708
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:26,001
Happy birthday, Conrad.

709
01:00:26,335 --> 01:00:27,836
Happy birthday.

710
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:31,048
Thank you, Father.

711
01:00:46,104 --> 01:00:48,065
I'm glad that we can finally see eye to eye.

712
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:51,109
Well, we can now.

713
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:57,491
Now that I've blown out 19 candles,
I'm sure you'll...

714
01:00:57,658 --> 01:01:00,160
give me your blessing as I join up and...

715
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:02,287
finally fulfill my duty to my country.

716
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:08,043
Conrad, you've just exceeded your duty
to your country.

717
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:11,964
My wishes have nothing to do with your age.

718
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,425
Father, your wishes were only granted
because of my age.

719
01:01:16,385 --> 01:01:18,846
There's nothing you can do to stop me now.

720
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:22,724
All I ask for is your blessing, at least.

721
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:27,396
I'm sorry, Conrad.

722
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:33,193
But you're asking for the one thing
that I cannot and I will not give you.

723
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:26,246
My kaiser.

724
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:30,834
Our naval blockade around England
has sunk another American passenger ship.

725
01:02:31,168 --> 01:02:33,795
The American president
could soon run out of patience...

726
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:36,465
and if they join the war on England's side...

727
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:38,467
we will be defeated.

728
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:40,969
There are no rules in war.

729
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:44,848
And making England starve to death
is worth the risk.

730
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:48,602
But if you send this...

731
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:51,146
it will mitigate the risk.

732
01:02:56,902 --> 01:02:58,153
Are you sure?

733
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,988
Yes, my kaiser.

734
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:05,160
Get me Zimmermann.

735
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,373
Zimmermann, telegraph the following.

736
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:20,926
Send this immediately.
Use the kaiser's top-level encoding.

737
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:25,764
{\an8}Gentlemen...

738
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:28,225
we have a priority-one intercept.

739
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:30,936
Whatever you're doing, cease now.

740
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:33,105
We need this code cracked pronto.

741
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,401
Tea?

742
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:38,485
Please.

743
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:48,287
Good job, Rita.

744
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:50,706
This code is what the kaiser has been using.

745
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:53,083
It must be unbelievably important.

746
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,459
Can you break it?

747
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:58,922
One! Two! Three! Four!

748
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:01,633
<i>I'll need a lot more information.</i>

749
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,552
Keep your eye on the enemy!

750
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:04,845
Aim rifles to the left!

751
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:05,929
Fire!

752
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:07,931
Thank you.

753
01:04:08,432 --> 01:04:10,350
What makes the grass grow?

754
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:12,352
Blood! Blood! Blood!

755
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:14,229
<i>What're you gonna do?</i>

756
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:15,981
Kill! Kill! Kill!

757
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:20,027
Here's your tea.

758
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:23,488
Quick! March!

759
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:30,662
I am using the cipher.

760
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:33,498
Is the eight a "Z" or is it an "R"?

761
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,962
<i>Godspeed to you all.</i>

762
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:40,881
And remember...

763
01:04:41,048 --> 01:04:44,801
<i>"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."</i>

764
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:46,094
What does that mean?

765
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:49,056
"It's sweet and proper
to die for one's country."

766
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:53,977
Direct from Germany.

767
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:55,395
Thank you.

768
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:04,321
<i>I am using the cipher.</i>

769
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:07,783
<i>Is the eight a "Z" or is it an "R"?</i>

770
01:05:09,826 --> 01:05:12,454
<i>A "Z." Thank you.</i>

771
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:24,550
I've cracked the code.

772
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:27,469
It's from Arthur Zimmermann,
the German Secretary of State in Berlin...

773
01:05:27,636 --> 01:05:29,596
to their ambassador in Mexico City.

774
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:32,182
He proposes an alliance with Mexico.

775
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:34,893
Germany wants to divert America's attention,
so they're asking Mexico to invade America.

776
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:38,897
In print, there.

777
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:42,317
So, when President Wilson sees this,
then he has no choice, but...

778
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:44,278
He has to enter the war.

779
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:46,238
And the war will be over.

780
01:05:46,864 --> 01:05:49,575
Well done. Oh, my dear Polly.

781
01:05:49,741 --> 01:05:51,285
Well done, you.

782
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,621
You are incredible.

783
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:57,541
And there's hope for Conrad.

784
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:03,755
<i>Well done, Oxford.</i>

785
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:08,177
My idiot cousin, the kaiser,
has finally shot himself in the foot.

786
01:06:08,343 --> 01:06:11,847
You've hit a six with this telegram, old boy.
Kitchener would be proud.

787
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:15,434
Well, I think champagne is in order.

788
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:18,478
Thank you, Your Majesty,
but I vowed not to drink...

789
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:22,733
until Conrad has returned
safely from the war.

790
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,526
Why didn't you mention that earlier?

791
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:29,156
I'll make sure the only action your boy sees
is sharpening the general's pencils.

792
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:32,618
I'm not sure that's cricket.

793
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:39,416
Orlando, you know how many boys' lives
you've saved with this telegram?

794
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,835
At least let me save one.

795
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:46,757
So...

796
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:49,885
now that Conrad's safety is assured...

797
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:53,972
to peace in our time.

798
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:56,850
To peace in our time.

799
01:06:58,352 --> 01:07:01,188
King George is waiting for your response,
Mr. President.

800
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:03,815
But how can this telegram be real?

801
01:07:03,982 --> 01:07:05,943
Not even the Germans would be this stupid.

802
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,695
-But, sir...
-I'm not doing a damn thing...

803
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:10,864
till I have undeniable proof.

804
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:12,491
Douglas.

805
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:15,035
Statesman on the rocks, please.

806
01:07:22,876 --> 01:07:25,337
Lieutenant Oxford reporting for duty, sir.

807
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:28,549
Ah, yes. Oxford.

808
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:32,594
Lucky man.
You've been assigned back to London.

809
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:37,224
Sir, there must be some mistake.

810
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:39,518
No. Fortune favors the brave...

811
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:42,646
or those under the king's gaze.

812
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:47,943
Sir.

813
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:51,238
Attention!

814
01:08:12,217 --> 01:08:13,302
Lance corporal.

815
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:14,803
Sir.

816
01:08:14,928 --> 01:08:15,929
What's your name?

817
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:17,555
Lance Corporal Reid, sir.

818
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,390
Follow me.

819
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:37,242
Shola, I presume.

820
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:39,786
Yes.

821
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:42,163
Conrad has sent me to see the duke.

822
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:45,751
And your name, sir?

823
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:50,839
Good question. It's a complicated answer.

824
01:08:51,006 --> 01:08:52,799
I can only tell the duke in person.

825
01:08:53,175 --> 01:08:54,635
Well, I still need a name.

826
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:56,511
This is gonna sound stupid.

827
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,348
But according to Conrad, I'm Lancelot.

828
01:09:00,015 --> 01:09:04,310
You're Merlin, and I'm requesting an audience
with King Arthur.

829
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:07,272
Follow me, sir.

830
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:13,319
"Doubts persist as to telegram authenticity.

831
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:16,240
"Worried Wilson won't go to war."

832
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:19,283
Idiots and fools.
There's nothing left to debate.

833
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:24,581
Polly, do you think we can extend our network
to the White House?

834
01:09:25,165 --> 01:09:28,377
Most of their household staff were trained
in England, so it shouldn't be a problem.

835
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:29,877
Right. Well, let's get to work, then.

836
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:31,255
I'll get on to it right away.

837
01:09:31,421 --> 01:09:32,421
Thank you.

838
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:39,555
Yes, come in.

839
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:44,142
Your Grace. We have a visitor.

840
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,602
Who is it?

841
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:48,438
A friend of Conrad saying he's Lancelot...

842
01:09:48,604 --> 01:09:50,064
asking to see King Arthur.

843
01:09:50,148 --> 01:09:51,149
What?

844
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:53,902
That brings back fond memories.

845
01:09:55,696 --> 01:09:56,822
Show him in, would you?

846
01:09:56,989 --> 01:09:57,990
Yes, sir.

847
01:09:58,866 --> 01:09:59,867
Sir.

848
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:03,453
Who are you?

849
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,373
Lance Corporal Reid of the Black Watch, sir.

850
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:10,127
So then why are you wearing
a Grenadiers officer's uniform?

851
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:17,926
This will explain it better than I can.

852
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:20,262
It's a wee bit surreal, sir.

853
01:10:26,727 --> 01:10:27,728
Odd.

854
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:30,647
It's a letter from Conrad.

855
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:33,233
You're Lancelot.

856
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:38,488
<i>Dear Father. I, too, can play games.</i>

857
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,117
<i>I've swapped places with Archie Reid...</i>

858
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:44,036
<i>the man in front of you.</i>

859
01:10:44,453 --> 01:10:45,454
Archie?

860
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:47,414
<i>-He's a good man...
-</i>Yes, sir.

861
01:10:47,581 --> 01:10:52,377
<i>...who is simply following my orders
and is possibly as confused as you are.</i>

862
01:10:52,794 --> 01:10:55,839
<i>Please ensure my actions
don't get him into any trouble.</i>

863
01:10:56,548 --> 01:11:00,052
<i>Tomorrow I finally fulfill my wish
to go to the front.</i>

864
01:11:00,886 --> 01:11:06,099
<i>And in the meantime, I enclose a poem
which I thought you might appreciate.</i>

865
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:08,727
<i>"Bent double...</i>

866
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:13,148
<i>"like old beggars under sacks...</i>

867
01:11:14,816 --> 01:11:18,654
<i>"Knock-kneed, coughing like hags...</i>

868
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:22,491
<i>"we cursed through sludge...</i>

869
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:27,746
<i>"Till on the haunting flares
we turned our backs...</i>

870
01:11:28,872 --> 01:11:34,253
<i>"And towards our distant rest
began to trudge.</i>

871
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,468
<i>"Men marched asleep.</i>

872
01:11:42,636 --> 01:11:46,265
<i>"Many had lost their boots,
but limped on...</i>

873
01:11:47,057 --> 01:11:48,600
<i>"blood-shod.</i>

874
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:54,898
<i>"All went lame, all blind.</i>

875
01:11:55,816 --> 01:11:58,193
<i>"Drunk with fatigue...</i>

876
01:11:58,569 --> 01:12:00,571
<i>"deaf even to the hoots...</i>

877
01:12:00,737 --> 01:12:04,533
<i>"Of tired outstripped five-nines</i>

878
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,410
<i>"that dropped behind."</i>

879
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:15,335
New lads.

880
01:12:15,586 --> 01:12:16,879
Welcome to the front line.

881
01:12:17,045 --> 01:12:18,255
This trench will be your home
for the next six...

882
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:21,008
I don't bloody believe it. Runner!

883
01:12:21,925 --> 01:12:23,385
Come on, lads!

884
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:36,023
Well, come on, lads! Cover the man!

885
01:12:38,317 --> 01:12:40,319
Cover the man!

886
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:45,157
Fire!

887
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:47,701
Keep running!

888
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:55,250
Hold your fire!

889
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:02,925
Good effort, men.

890
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,094
This war never stops surprising me.

891
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:09,932
A German wavin' a Union Jack! What's next?

892
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:12,392
Allow me to answer that, Sergeant Major.

893
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:13,936
Fall in!

894
01:13:16,772 --> 01:13:19,399
That runner was actually a British spy.

895
01:13:19,566 --> 01:13:21,235
He was bringing me vital information.

896
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:25,489
Our country needs what he was carrying,
and I therefore need six volunteers.

897
01:13:26,114 --> 01:13:30,244
You will accompany me to retrieve
what's left of him as soon as it's dark.

898
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:35,249
Very good, lad.

899
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:37,709
Who else?

900
01:13:39,837 --> 01:13:40,879
Sergeant?

901
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:45,050
You five. One step forward. March!

902
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:49,096
Five more brave volunteers, sir.

903
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:52,724
Excellent.
We move out at midnight.

904
01:14:33,473 --> 01:14:34,641
Hold your fire.

905
01:14:35,434 --> 01:14:39,271
If they hear us from the trenches,
we'll be fired upon from both sides.

906
01:14:54,369 --> 01:14:56,079
Boom.

907
01:16:14,741 --> 01:16:15,742
Please don't.

908
01:16:30,549 --> 01:16:31,758
I'm so sorry.

909
01:17:02,873 --> 01:17:03,874
What was that?

910
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:29,274
It's over there.

911
01:17:29,358 --> 01:17:30,859
Don't shoot!

912
01:17:33,111 --> 01:17:34,112
No!

913
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,071
Cease fire!

914
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:42,681
First time out here, lad?

915
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:44,766
Hey.

916
01:18:47,728 --> 01:18:48,937
Same side.

917
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:51,356
Thank God for the Union Jack, eh?

918
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:58,906
I can honestly say that my first time
was worse than losing this leg.

919
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:05,871
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't be the one crying.

920
01:19:06,038 --> 01:19:08,540
Come over here and help me out. I'm freezing.

921
01:19:14,296 --> 01:19:17,216
Come here. Come on.

922
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:29,311
I thought I knew what I wanted.

923
01:19:35,567 --> 01:19:37,819
My father warned me.

924
01:19:38,862 --> 01:19:42,074
My father warned me. I didn't listen...

925
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:45,994
and now it all makes sense.

926
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:52,751
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

927
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:57,840
Well, I suggest
we solve both our problems, yeah?

928
01:19:58,382 --> 01:19:59,842
Look.

929
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:02,594
I need to get this to high command.

930
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:05,597
The contents could help end this bloody war.

931
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,935
As I won't be walking any time soon...

932
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:13,939
I suggest you finish the mission...

933
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:18,277
and go home to a hero's welcome.

934
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:23,699
No, no. No. Off we go to a hero's welcome.

935
01:20:43,886 --> 01:20:46,054
It's okay. I've got you.

936
01:20:55,314 --> 01:20:57,357
Shit. Hurry!

937
01:20:59,568 --> 01:21:01,695
Covering fire!

938
01:21:01,862 --> 01:21:03,155
Give them cover, lads!

939
01:21:06,575 --> 01:21:07,576
Fucking move!

940
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:13,207
Take out the machine gunner!

941
01:21:13,665 --> 01:21:14,917
Cover him!

942
01:21:20,547 --> 01:21:23,091
Go!

943
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:26,011
Run!

944
01:21:26,178 --> 01:21:28,472
-Let's go, man! Run!
-Run! Run! Run!

945
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:10,013
You all right?
You all right?

946
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:14,726
Jesus Christ! You were amazin'!
I've never seen anything like it.

947
01:22:14,893 --> 01:22:17,354
What the bloody hell
were you doing over there in the first place?

948
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:20,899
You better ask him. Ask him.

949
01:22:21,358 --> 01:22:23,277
He'll explain everything.

950
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:25,988
He took the full force of that blast, sir.

951
01:22:26,154 --> 01:22:28,407
Yeah. But at least you made it back, son.

952
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:32,786
I tell you, if that ain't worth
a Victoria Cross, I don't know what is.

953
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:34,413
I must carry on the mission.

954
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,790
We need to get this
to high command immediately.

955
01:22:36,957 --> 01:22:39,877
I'll take you there myself.
What's your name, soldier?

956
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:43,922
Archie. Lance Corporal Archie Reid.

957
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:45,090
Archie Reid, did you say?

958
01:22:46,758 --> 01:22:47,759
Yes.

959
01:22:48,177 --> 01:22:49,261
That's right.

960
01:22:49,428 --> 01:22:50,929
Lance Corporal Archie Reid?

961
01:22:51,805 --> 01:22:53,974
Dog Platoon, First Battalion,
the Black Watch?

962
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:55,809
Aye.

963
01:22:58,103 --> 01:22:59,897
Is that your best Scottish accent?

964
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:01,523
You're not Archie Reid.

965
01:23:02,107 --> 01:23:04,109
Lance Corporal Archie Reid's
a friend of mine.

966
01:23:04,276 --> 01:23:05,986
And I've been looking for him all night.
So who are you?

967
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:10,199
Yes, yes. You're right.
There's a simple explanation.

968
01:23:10,616 --> 01:23:11,950
-I'm not Archie Reid.
-Fuckin' German spy.

969
01:23:12,117 --> 01:23:13,202
I'm Conra...

970
01:23:34,681 --> 01:23:36,308
<i>Your son was killed in action, sir.</i>

971
01:23:49,655 --> 01:23:50,656
What?

972
01:24:33,866 --> 01:24:34,950
Polly.

973
01:24:38,495 --> 01:24:39,663
Polly.

974
01:24:51,466 --> 01:24:53,051
My son.

975
01:25:03,395 --> 01:25:04,605
Why?

976
01:25:16,658 --> 01:25:20,746
{\an8}<i>"If in some smothering dreams...</i>

977
01:25:20,913 --> 01:25:25,542
{\an8}<i>"you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in...</i>

978
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:30,839
{\an8}<i>"And watch the white eyes
writhing in his face...</i>

979
01:25:33,467 --> 01:25:38,764
"His hanging face,
like a devil's sick of sin...

980
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:42,684
"If you could hear, at every jolt...

981
01:25:42,976 --> 01:25:47,231
"the blood, come gargling
from the froth-corrupted lungs...

982
01:25:48,607 --> 01:25:51,193
"Obscene as cancer...

983
01:25:52,236 --> 01:25:54,279
"bitter as the cud...

984
01:25:54,655 --> 01:26:00,244
"Of vile, incurable sores
on innocent tongues...

985
01:26:01,453 --> 01:26:02,829
"My friend...

986
01:26:03,956 --> 01:26:08,168
"you would not tell with such high zest...

987
01:26:08,335 --> 01:26:11,046
"To children ardent for...

988
01:26:11,672 --> 01:26:13,841
"some desperate glory...

989
01:26:14,007 --> 01:26:15,884
"The old Lie...

990
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:20,389
<i>"Dulce et decorum est...</i>

991
01:26:21,473 --> 01:26:24,059
<i>"Pro patria mori."</i>

992
01:26:25,936 --> 01:26:28,981
It is sweet and proper...

993
01:26:29,982 --> 01:26:33,360
to die for one's country.

994
01:26:50,836 --> 01:26:54,256
I, Nikolai Aleksandrovich Romanov...

995
01:26:54,423 --> 01:26:56,466
Emperor of Russia...

996
01:26:56,633 --> 01:26:58,969
do hereby declare
my irrevocable determination...

997
01:26:59,136 --> 01:27:02,306
to renounce the throne for myself
and my descendants...

998
01:27:02,472 --> 01:27:05,809
through this instrument of abdication...

999
01:27:07,644 --> 01:27:09,188
immediately.

1000
01:27:35,547 --> 01:27:37,633
The documents Conrad recovered...

1001
01:27:38,509 --> 01:27:40,552
turned out to be the German ambassador's
original handwritten telegram that I cracked.

1002
01:27:44,598 --> 01:27:47,226
It's the concrete proof America needed.

1003
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:50,854
America will now have to join the war.

1004
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:53,982
Conrad succeeded where we all failed.

1005
01:28:04,826 --> 01:28:05,953
My Shepherd.

1006
01:28:07,287 --> 01:28:08,664
There is a code of honor...

1007
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:13,502
and using a distraction to your own advantage
breaks that code.

1008
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:15,295
-What?
-Apologies, my Shepherd...

1009
01:28:15,462 --> 01:28:17,256
but I have disturbing news.

1010
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:20,717
While your plan for Russia
has been a great success...

1011
01:28:20,884 --> 01:28:24,638
my plan to keep America out of the war
has backfired.

1012
01:28:25,138 --> 01:28:28,058
The American president is about
to be given the actual telegram...

1013
01:28:28,225 --> 01:28:29,726
I forced the kaiser to send.

1014
01:28:30,102 --> 01:28:34,356
Such undeniable proof could provoke
the Americans into entering the war.

1015
01:28:39,778 --> 01:28:41,113
<i>En garde.</i>

1016
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:50,247
I like a man who will admit to his mistakes,
I do.

1017
01:28:50,706 --> 01:28:54,710
But I like more a woman who can fix them.

1018
01:28:54,877 --> 01:28:59,464
Have our American friend Dupont
get Mata into the White House.

1019
01:28:59,673 --> 01:29:03,969
Time for you to work your magic
on the president, Mata.

1020
01:29:04,136 --> 01:29:05,512
Now, go on.

1021
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:11,518
It's time to show the president
who the real boss is.

1022
01:29:21,111 --> 01:29:22,529
Will Your Grace be having tea?

1023
01:29:25,908 --> 01:29:27,743
It's scotch time.

1024
01:29:28,577 --> 01:29:30,287
Twenty-four hours a day.

1025
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:10,536
For the last time,
I don't want any fucking tea!

1026
01:30:10,702 --> 01:30:12,120
Neither do I.

1027
01:30:13,664 --> 01:30:14,831
Sir.

1028
01:30:17,793 --> 01:30:20,963
Though it looks like you could use
a strong one to sober up.

1029
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:24,299
I'm afraid it'll take more than that, sir.

1030
01:30:24,466 --> 01:30:26,760
Oh, well, maybe this will do the trick.

1031
01:30:26,927 --> 01:30:28,929
Russia's pulled out of the war.

1032
01:30:29,596 --> 01:30:32,099
The British Empire faces imminent defeat.

1033
01:30:32,933 --> 01:30:35,561
America still refuses to join.

1034
01:30:36,687 --> 01:30:39,606
I personally telephoned President Wilson.

1035
01:30:40,941 --> 01:30:43,026
He didn't deign to receive my call.

1036
01:30:43,193 --> 01:30:45,863
So, they got to him as well.

1037
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:47,030
Indeed.

1038
01:30:48,574 --> 01:30:50,576
The kaiser's blockade is working.

1039
01:30:51,326 --> 01:30:53,120
The people are hungry.

1040
01:30:53,871 --> 01:30:56,957
The next revolution might be here.

1041
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:03,672
I've even been advised to change
my German surname Saxe-Coburg to Windsor.

1042
01:31:04,506 --> 01:31:05,674
More English.

1043
01:31:08,135 --> 01:31:10,012
I'm afraid, then, sir...

1044
01:31:10,596 --> 01:31:12,639
that England is doomed.

1045
01:31:20,063 --> 01:31:21,690
I wanted to give you this.

1046
01:31:23,066 --> 01:31:24,109
For Conrad.

1047
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:27,487
A true hero.

1048
01:31:29,698 --> 01:31:32,117
A man who knew his duty.

1049
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:46,798
Enough of this self-pitying poppycock.

1050
01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:48,634
If it were just you...

1051
01:31:49,218 --> 01:31:53,472
you and I, in our grief,
I'd say do as you will.

1052
01:31:54,056 --> 01:31:57,476
Drown in drink, and I'd join you.

1053
01:31:58,435 --> 01:31:59,978
But he's watching.

1054
01:32:02,397 --> 01:32:05,108
And he would have been such a better man.

1055
01:32:09,488 --> 01:32:11,031
But he can't.

1056
01:32:12,241 --> 01:32:16,078
He won't be that. Not anymore.

1057
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:20,916
So, you must, in his stead...

1058
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:25,504
be the man your son would have been.

1059
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:35,347
Regretfully, I can no longer remain
in your service.

1060
01:32:37,182 --> 01:32:38,642
Forgive me, my lady.

1061
01:32:47,442 --> 01:32:49,486
My heart is broken as well.

1062
01:32:50,529 --> 01:32:52,906
Polly. Polly.

1063
01:32:54,867 --> 01:32:56,743
I do not accept your resignation.

1064
01:32:59,538 --> 01:33:00,581
But...

1065
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:06,086
I will accept a very strong cup of tea.

1066
01:33:38,994 --> 01:33:40,120
Looking better, Your Grace.

1067
01:33:42,122 --> 01:33:43,832
Feeling better, Polly.

1068
01:33:45,751 --> 01:33:46,960
So, what have I missed?

1069
01:33:47,461 --> 01:33:49,755
We followed your last sober order...

1070
01:33:49,922 --> 01:33:52,925
<i>and extended our network to the White House.</i>

1071
01:33:53,091 --> 01:33:54,885
<i>The president's butler informed us that since
receiving the telegram Conrad recovered...</i>

1072
01:33:57,387 --> 01:33:59,306
<i>the president hasn't been himself.</i>

1073
01:33:59,473 --> 01:34:03,060
This may be the proof I asked for.
But remember my election promise.

1074
01:34:03,227 --> 01:34:04,811
Out of the war, not in.

1075
01:34:04,978 --> 01:34:07,314
Douglas, get me a Statesman on the rocks,
now!

1076
01:34:07,898 --> 01:34:11,610
<i>Constantly engaged in top-secret
conversations with his embassy in London.</i>

1077
01:34:11,902 --> 01:34:14,154
And ignoring all advice to go to war.

1078
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:16,406
And do we have someone in the embassy?

1079
01:34:16,573 --> 01:34:17,741
Of course.

1080
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:19,284
Mr. President...

1081
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,036
I don't know how to proceed.

1082
01:34:21,245 --> 01:34:23,789
<i>We're meeting to discuss her new demands.</i>

1083
01:34:23,956 --> 01:34:25,415
-I see.
-She was very convincing.

1084
01:34:25,582 --> 01:34:28,502
And she suggests we make
an unannounced visit at 3:00.

1085
01:34:28,669 --> 01:34:32,089
Right, well.
We had better get a move on, then.

1086
01:34:46,311 --> 01:34:47,479
Good afternoon.

1087
01:34:47,646 --> 01:34:50,858
Please inform the ambassador
the Duke of Oxford is here to see him.

1088
01:34:52,651 --> 01:34:53,861
Yes, Your Grace.

1089
01:34:55,445 --> 01:34:56,864
Mr. Ambassador.

1090
01:35:02,744 --> 01:35:03,954
<i>Why did you kill my friend?</i>

1091
01:35:04,413 --> 01:35:05,706
It was the alcohol.

1092
01:35:06,081 --> 01:35:07,082
I was overcome.

1093
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:10,460
<i>Thank you for your time, Mr. Ambassador.</i>

1094
01:35:17,676 --> 01:35:19,636
If you wouldn't mind...

1095
01:35:20,429 --> 01:35:23,682
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help admiring your scarf.

1096
01:35:23,849 --> 01:35:25,559
An exquisite cashmere.

1097
01:35:25,726 --> 01:35:27,102
Yes, it's very rare.

1098
01:35:27,269 --> 01:35:30,189
Do you know the test
of a truly pure cashmere?

1099
01:35:31,523 --> 01:35:32,566
A ring.

1100
01:35:33,025 --> 01:35:37,070
Yet, happily, you do not wear one.

1101
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:39,698
You are...

1102
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:42,117
mistaken.

1103
01:35:42,492 --> 01:35:43,869
Now that...

1104
01:35:45,078 --> 01:35:46,246
is disappointing.

1105
01:35:46,413 --> 01:35:48,081
But this...

1106
01:35:49,666 --> 01:35:50,667
is not.

1107
01:36:02,763 --> 01:36:04,515
I believe it's ungentlemanly
to hurt a woman...

1108
01:36:04,681 --> 01:36:06,558
but since the fate of the world
hangs in the balance...

1109
01:36:06,683 --> 01:36:07,935
I'm going to bend the rules.

1110
01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:12,147
Now tell me who's behind this,
or so help me you'll never breathe again.

1111
01:36:13,315 --> 01:36:15,108
You will have to kill me.

1112
01:36:26,119 --> 01:36:27,579
Ambassador.

1113
01:36:29,164 --> 01:36:30,916
-Is she dead?
-No.

1114
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:33,836
She has an extreme case of hypoxia.

1115
01:36:34,127 --> 01:36:38,882
She'll be fine, and so will you,
as long as we have an honest conversation.

1116
01:36:46,598 --> 01:36:50,227
What you're lookin' at
is the lady you strangled.

1117
01:36:50,394 --> 01:36:53,063
She filmed herself seducing the president...

1118
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:57,734
and is now blackmailing us
to not even think about entering the war.

1119
01:36:57,901 --> 01:37:01,530
We cannot risk the integrity
of the U.S. presidency.

1120
01:37:01,697 --> 01:37:03,073
I'm sure.

1121
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,951
Now, if we can get that negative...

1122
01:37:06,118 --> 01:37:09,997
then we will happily join England
and put Germany out of business.

1123
01:37:10,163 --> 01:37:12,457
Well, I suggest you interrogate her.

1124
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:16,628
And I'll follow up on this.

1125
01:37:18,672 --> 01:37:21,717
This is cashmere from the Kamaliro goat.

1126
01:37:22,718 --> 01:37:23,760
It's very rare.

1127
01:37:24,428 --> 01:37:25,596
Where does it come from?

1128
01:37:26,471 --> 01:37:29,183
Mr. Collins, cashmere book number one,
please.

1129
01:37:31,602 --> 01:37:32,603
Thank you.

1130
01:37:33,854 --> 01:37:36,481
It comes from here.

1131
01:37:36,648 --> 01:37:40,277
The only place in the world
where the Kamaliro goat breeds.

1132
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:41,445
Excellent.

1133
01:37:41,612 --> 01:37:42,613
Shola...

1134
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:45,449
we're going into the cashmere business.

1135
01:38:03,133 --> 01:38:06,428
I can see six men guarding the lift.

1136
01:38:08,597 --> 01:38:09,765
If you can call it that.

1137
01:38:09,932 --> 01:38:12,809
Give the word
and their numbers will be reduced.

1138
01:38:13,519 --> 01:38:16,855
Oh, no, Polly. The film's negative
is going to be up there.

1139
01:38:17,022 --> 01:38:18,440
And that's our real prize.

1140
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:21,568
If these guards are alerted,
then I don't think we'll make it up.

1141
01:38:21,735 --> 01:38:23,862
It's vital that we control this lift.

1142
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:33,038
This is called a parachute.

1143
01:38:33,455 --> 01:38:36,375
It means that one can
jump out of a plane safely.

1144
01:38:37,709 --> 01:38:38,710
So...

1145
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:41,964
tomorrow at dawn
I'll fly the plane over the mountain...

1146
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:43,632
and Shola will jump out.

1147
01:38:44,216 --> 01:38:46,176
You land with the parachute...

1148
01:38:46,343 --> 01:38:50,889
take control of the lift,
and then you fire this flare.

1149
01:38:51,265 --> 01:38:54,685
It's a signal to me,
by which time I'll have landed the plane...

1150
01:38:54,852 --> 01:38:58,647
made my way over to the bottom of the lift,
while Polly provides cover.

1151
01:38:59,481 --> 01:39:02,442
Sir, I could do anything for you...

1152
01:39:02,609 --> 01:39:05,112
but I cannot jump out of an airplane.

1153
01:39:05,487 --> 01:39:07,322
And it's not that I wouldn't try...

1154
01:39:08,615 --> 01:39:10,742
it's that I know I'd let you down.

1155
01:39:11,577 --> 01:39:14,079
Yes. Well, I appreciate
your fear of heights...

1156
01:39:14,246 --> 01:39:17,499
but I am the only one who can fly. So...

1157
01:39:17,791 --> 01:39:19,585
But you wouldn't have to land the plane.

1158
01:39:19,751 --> 01:39:21,962
You just have to land yourself.

1159
01:39:27,092 --> 01:39:32,014
Well, it would be bad form to ask a man
to do something that I wouldn't do myself.

1160
01:39:32,181 --> 01:39:36,018
All right, Shola, get ready for my signal.

1161
01:39:37,477 --> 01:39:38,979
We go at dawn.

1162
01:43:41,388 --> 01:43:42,389
Shit!

1163
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:22,763
That's it. That's it.

1164
01:44:34,525 --> 01:44:36,401
Answer the question, Dupont.

1165
01:44:36,568 --> 01:44:39,446
Do you know where Mata is?

1166
01:44:39,613 --> 01:44:42,699
-No. I...
-Well, you fuckin' should.

1167
01:44:42,866 --> 01:44:45,244
Because I sent her to the American Embassy,
and she hasn't been seen since!

1168
01:44:49,498 --> 01:44:50,874
Do you see this?

1169
01:44:51,041 --> 01:44:54,545
If the American president
thinks he can fuck me too...

1170
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:56,547
he is very much mistaken.

1171
01:44:56,713 --> 01:45:01,552
Take this negative to the press,
and it will ruin his reputation.

1172
01:45:01,718 --> 01:45:05,389
War will be the last thing
on the Americans' mind.

1173
01:45:05,556 --> 01:45:10,853
And when the scandal is over,
make sure the new president is in our pocket!

1174
01:45:11,061 --> 01:45:13,021
Go on. Run! Run!

1175
01:45:13,397 --> 01:45:14,982
All the way to the White House.

1176
01:45:21,029 --> 01:45:22,239
Let's check the other side.

1177
01:45:22,406 --> 01:45:24,116
Let's go around to the south.

1178
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:28,871
Make it snappy, pal!

1179
01:45:35,294 --> 01:45:36,295
Hey!

1180
01:45:43,719 --> 01:45:45,345
What the hell?

1181
01:45:52,311 --> 01:45:53,812
Buddy, what's the holdup?

1182
01:46:02,237 --> 01:46:03,238
Look!

1183
01:46:04,031 --> 01:46:05,199
There's the signal.

1184
01:46:05,407 --> 01:46:07,701
Get to the lift. I'll cover you.

1185
01:46:21,256 --> 01:46:22,257
Up on the hill!

1186
01:47:23,569 --> 01:47:26,071
Who the hell is that guy?

1187
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:50,637
Shola! Stop fuckin' about!
Get on that counterweight!

1188
01:48:06,236 --> 01:48:07,237
Fuck!

1189
01:48:36,683 --> 01:48:37,684
Thank God you're here.

1190
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,438
This plan hasn't exactly gone by the numbers.

1191
01:48:47,736 --> 01:48:49,530
Polly. Do you have the film?

1192
01:48:49,696 --> 01:48:51,823
I have the negative in my hand, Your Grace.

1193
01:48:52,407 --> 01:48:53,742
Well done.

1194
01:48:53,867 --> 01:48:55,494
So we have what we came for.

1195
01:48:55,661 --> 01:48:58,914
Yes. But the cause of all this mayhem
is still in there.

1196
01:48:59,248 --> 01:49:01,792
Enough of dealing with tentacles, Shola.

1197
01:49:01,959 --> 01:49:03,710
It's time to cut off the head.

1198
01:49:04,545 --> 01:49:06,338
It's good to have you back, sir.

1199
01:50:01,727 --> 01:50:06,106
You have got to be fucking kidding me.

1200
01:50:06,273 --> 01:50:12,446
The thorn in my side
has just been a peace-loving English rose.

1201
01:50:13,238 --> 01:50:17,159
The Duke of Oxford. Good day to you, sir!

1202
01:50:17,951 --> 01:50:19,745
You are the very symbol...

1203
01:50:19,912 --> 01:50:22,122
of everything I'm tryin' to destroy.

1204
01:50:22,289 --> 01:50:27,419
Aristocrats like you stole my parents' mill
in Scotland when I was a lad.

1205
01:50:27,878 --> 01:50:31,006
Entitlement has "title" in it
for a reason, no?

1206
01:50:32,883 --> 01:50:36,053
I'm gonna fucking love killing you.

1207
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:38,931
Come to papa, you posh prick!

1208
01:50:50,025 --> 01:50:51,026
I'm out.

1209
01:51:07,668 --> 01:51:10,504
The sound of silence.

1210
01:51:11,213 --> 01:51:14,716
It's my understanding that you, Duke...

1211
01:51:14,883 --> 01:51:16,927
are a formidable swordsman.

1212
01:51:17,845 --> 01:51:23,016
What say we end this shite as gentlemen?

1213
01:51:23,809 --> 01:51:25,102
After all...

1214
01:51:25,727 --> 01:51:28,146
manners maketh man.

1215
01:51:28,772 --> 01:51:32,025
A gentleman does not hide in the shadows.

1216
01:51:33,193 --> 01:51:34,194
Aye.

1217
01:51:47,082 --> 01:51:48,709
Surprise.

1218
01:51:57,009 --> 01:51:58,218
Morton.

1219
01:52:00,012 --> 01:52:01,013
You see...

1220
01:52:01,597 --> 01:52:04,850
<i>a little misplaced trust
allows one to get away with murder.</i>

1221
01:52:05,017 --> 01:52:08,187
This debate should happen
after we have won the war.

1222
01:52:09,521 --> 01:52:13,150
I suggest we go to Russia,
and we sort it out ourselves.

1223
01:52:13,317 --> 01:52:14,943
<i>And in poor Kitchener's case...</i>

1224
01:52:17,446 --> 01:52:18,906
<i>quite literally.</i>

1225
01:52:22,701 --> 01:52:24,161
Spoken like a true traitor.

1226
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:27,080
As far as I'm concerned, his blood...

1227
01:52:30,209 --> 01:52:32,503
that's on your grubby hands.

1228
01:52:35,047 --> 01:52:36,215
Two on one?

1229
01:52:37,174 --> 01:52:39,551
Behaving like a true gentleman.

1230
01:52:44,056 --> 01:52:45,724
You're delusional.

1231
01:52:46,433 --> 01:52:47,976
And you've killed millions.

1232
01:52:48,685 --> 01:52:51,897
What say one more, for good measure?

1233
01:52:52,689 --> 01:52:53,690
Hey!

1234
01:53:31,019 --> 01:53:32,354
Come on, old man.

1235
01:53:32,896 --> 01:53:33,981
Get up.

1236
01:53:35,107 --> 01:53:36,608
I said, get up!

1237
01:54:58,232 --> 01:55:00,943
Fuck this gentleman shite.

1238
01:55:24,925 --> 01:55:26,343
Fuck's sake.

1239
01:55:33,392 --> 01:55:35,269
You bastard.

1240
01:56:12,055 --> 01:56:15,976
Give my regards to dear old Kitch, yeah?

1241
01:56:34,494 --> 01:56:37,414
You can't do it. You can't let me fall.

1242
01:56:37,831 --> 01:56:42,419
It goes against your every belief.
You are a pacifist.

1243
01:56:43,295 --> 01:56:47,299
And I'm now completely reliant
on your mercy, old boy.

1244
01:56:47,466 --> 01:56:50,928
You're right. I shouldn't let you fall.

1245
01:56:51,512 --> 01:56:56,600
Only now I have become the man
that my son would have been.

1246
01:56:59,853 --> 01:57:00,854
You...

1247
01:57:30,175 --> 01:57:31,176
Sir.

1248
01:57:31,552 --> 01:57:33,428
Shola, are you all right?

1249
01:57:34,429 --> 01:57:36,557
We've been through worse, Your Grace.

1250
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:42,646
So, you'd jump in front of a bullet for me,
but not out of an airplane?

1251
01:57:44,189 --> 01:57:45,899
So it would seem.

1252
01:57:47,150 --> 01:57:48,527
Thank you, my friend.

1253
01:57:48,694 --> 01:57:50,153
My pleasure.

1254
01:57:51,905 --> 01:57:53,365
So, Shola.

1255
01:57:54,074 --> 01:57:56,577
How are we going to get down from here?

1256
01:58:09,256 --> 01:58:10,674
Come in.

1257
01:58:11,341 --> 01:58:14,720
Mr. President, Chef has made
your favorite peanut butter cookies.

1258
01:58:19,975 --> 01:58:21,351
Thank you.

1259
01:58:39,161 --> 01:58:42,122
Get me the generals, immediately.

1260
01:58:46,418 --> 01:58:48,670
We're goin' to war!

1261
01:59:04,811 --> 01:59:08,357
This victory is all down to you...

1262
01:59:08,524 --> 01:59:11,527
and your fine son, Conrad.

1263
01:59:11,902 --> 01:59:14,988
And the courage of so many others, sir.

1264
01:59:15,155 --> 01:59:16,490
Of course.

1265
01:59:18,116 --> 01:59:20,869
Britain thanks you. And I thank you...

1266
01:59:21,203 --> 01:59:24,706
for ensuring that I didn't meet the same fate
as my cousins.

1267
01:59:25,749 --> 01:59:28,544
<i>Wilhelm's abdication was understandable...</i>

1268
01:59:29,753 --> 01:59:31,755
<i>but what happened to Nicholas...</i>

1269
01:59:34,633 --> 01:59:36,093
was despicable.

1270
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:37,928
It was, sir.

1271
01:59:38,095 --> 01:59:41,974
I owe you a great personal debt
that I still have my crown.

1272
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:49,690
In that case, would you meet me tomorrow
at Kingsman, 3:00?

1273
01:59:49,857 --> 01:59:50,858
A tailor shop?

1274
01:59:50,983 --> 01:59:51,984
Yes, sir.

1275
01:59:52,109 --> 01:59:54,778
Number 11, Savile Row.

1276
01:59:59,992 --> 02:00:03,245
All of us here today are united...

1277
02:00:03,412 --> 02:00:09,251
sadly, in losing our sons and friends
in this terrible war.

1278
02:00:09,418 --> 02:00:14,256
What happened to this generation of young men
must never happen again.

1279
02:00:14,423 --> 02:00:17,634
I believe the terms of Versailles
are too onerous...

1280
02:00:17,801 --> 02:00:21,305
too extreme,
and could precipitate another war.

1281
02:00:22,347 --> 02:00:26,393
What the world needs is an organization
that can channel its resources...

1282
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:30,981
towards preserving peace
and protecting life.

1283
02:00:31,148 --> 02:00:33,984
An independent intelligence agency...

1284
02:00:34,151 --> 02:00:37,154
operating at the highest level
of discretion...

1285
02:00:37,321 --> 02:00:42,701
above the politics and bureaucracy
of government-run spy organizations.

1286
02:00:43,452 --> 02:00:44,703
To that end...

1287
02:00:45,537 --> 02:00:48,540
I have acquired this shop.

1288
02:00:48,707 --> 02:00:53,629
And I propose that we become
the founding members of...

1289
02:00:54,296 --> 02:00:56,965
the Kingsman agency.

1290
02:00:58,634 --> 02:01:00,552
My code name will be...

1291
02:01:02,346 --> 02:01:03,472
Arthur.

1292
02:01:04,014 --> 02:01:07,017
And if you agree to join me,
you may turn over your place card...

1293
02:01:07,184 --> 02:01:09,645
where you will find your own code name.

1294
02:01:12,356 --> 02:01:14,399
I am Galahad.

1295
02:01:18,487 --> 02:01:19,947
I am Lancelot.

1296
02:01:21,532 --> 02:01:24,409
I am Bedivere.

1297
02:01:27,663 --> 02:01:29,623
I am Percival.

1298
02:01:29,790 --> 02:01:30,874
Excellent.

1299
02:01:32,167 --> 02:01:35,254
And this is Merlin...

1300
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:37,506
who will be our quartermaster.

1301
02:01:39,299 --> 02:01:42,719
May our sons and friends rest in peace.

1302
02:01:43,053 --> 02:01:46,306
And long live the Kingsman.

1303
02:01:47,641 --> 02:01:49,476
The Kingsman.

1304
02:03:47,761 --> 02:03:50,764
Now it's time to address
the balance of my new flock.

1305
02:03:50,931 --> 02:03:53,392
Thanks to you, Comrade,
our left hand is strong.

1306
02:03:53,559 --> 02:03:57,271
But as you once said,
our right hand now needs strengthening.

1307
02:03:58,355 --> 02:03:59,648
Come in.

1308
02:04:05,112 --> 02:04:06,363
Don't be shy.

1309
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:07,948
Come, come.

1310
02:04:12,452 --> 02:04:13,453
My Shepherd.

1311
02:04:14,121 --> 02:04:18,625
This young man will come to rival
your position in this world, my friend.

1312
02:04:19,710 --> 02:04:21,837
It is an honor, Comrade Lenin.

1313
02:04:23,922 --> 02:04:25,591
And your name?

1314
02:04:27,342 --> 02:04:29,094
Adolf Hitler.

1314
02:04:30,305 --> 02:05:30,726
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
