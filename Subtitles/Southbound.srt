2
00:00:32,178 --> 00:00:33,714
Fuck this shit.

3
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:04,378
Let's go home.

4
00:01:12,318 --> 00:01:15,765
Regret and remorse. Amends and atonement.

5
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:17,324
That's life, right?

6
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:19,802
Well, this next one is for you,

7
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,399
all you lost souls racing down
that long road to redemption,

8
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:27,240
and all you sinners running from your past

9
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,180
but heading straight
into that pit of darkness up ahead.

10
00:01:31,237 --> 00:01:34,150
We're all on the same endless highway,

11
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:40,180
the one with no name, no exits, looking
for a way out of tonight and into tomorrow.

12
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:44,488
Well, they're gonna try to stop you,
but you gotta say, "Fuck it,"

13
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:48,158
and keep moving,
because this is your highway,

14
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:51,225
and tonight might just be
the night you finally outrun

15
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,101
those wicked demons once and for all.

16
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,109
And I'll be right here with you
making sure you get where you're going.

17
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:36,236
What's up?

18
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:38,177
Nothing.

19
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:03,908
Don't worry. We're fine.

20
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,665
It's customers only.

21
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:32,459
Hey!

22
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:36,696
Read the sign.

23
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:43,709
Twenty on the truck.

24
00:03:50,943 --> 00:03:52,354
Rough night?

25
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:57,490
Yeah.

26
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,174
Have a nice day.

27
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:56,745
Fuck.

28
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,645
Mitch! Let's get the fuck outta here.

29
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:26,542
Come on!

30
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,148
Come again soon.

31
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:40,690
Fuck!

32
00:06:00,072 --> 00:06:01,210
What the fuck?

33
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:10,224
What the fuck?

34
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,701
Rough night?

35
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:39,113
What the fuck?

36
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:20,822
There's gotta be a way out.

37
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:32,065
What if there's not?

38
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:35,905
Pull over.

39
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:37,979
- What?
- Pull over.

40
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:39,516
Are you crazy?

41
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:41,809
What are you gonna do?

42
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:43,849
I'm not running.

43
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,721
Mitch! Mitch!

44
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:50,449
Hey!

45
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,185
Hey!

46
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:55,065
I know we've had a pretty fucked up day,

47
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:57,965
but if you could keep it together for
a little bit longer, that would be great.

48
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:00,163
Why? What are we running to?

49
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,227
What?

50
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,865
So we get out of here, we go home,
and then what?

51
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,501
And then nothing! Then we're home!
That's the point!

52
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:08,545
- Back to normal!
- Exactly.

53
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:12,246
Mitch, you wanted this.

54
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:16,250
We did this for you.
We did this for Kathryn.

55
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:19,085
So get in the fucking truck.

56
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:21,483
I'm not asking you to stay.

57
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:25,089
You've lost it, man.

58
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:28,121
You want to stay here and get killed?

59
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:30,429
- I'll see you around.
- Jack.

60
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:32,962
Come on.

61
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,070
What do you want?

62
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:43,607
Haven't you figured it out?

63
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:45,244
They've come to collect.

64
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:49,749
There's no way out. We fucked up.

65
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,083
You know what, Mitch? Fuck you.
I'm going home.

66
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,921
No!

67
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:03,926
Jack!

68
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:36,715
Dad?

69
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,986
Kathryn?

70
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:04,641
Dad! Why won't you help me?

71
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:08,683
Kathryn!

72
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:19,427
Dad, help me!

73
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:21,860
Kathryn!

74
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:24,299
Dad, I need help!

75
00:12:25,357 --> 00:12:26,495
Help!

76
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,663
Fuck!

77
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:29,734
Dad!

78
00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:34,475
Dad, I need your help! Help me!

79
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:36,607
- Kathryn!
- Dad!

80
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:38,510
- Kathryn!
- Dad!

81
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:41,344
Fuck! Kathryn! Fuck!

82
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:43,642
Fuck!

83
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,836
Why?

84
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:42,201
It's piercing my brain.

85
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:45,181
My God. It's 1:00.

86
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:48,946
Guys, we gotta go. Ava, get up.

87
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:51,346
Come on.

88
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,754
I've never been so hungover in my life.

89
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:01,723
You guys got everything?

90
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:06,927
Now, maybe you're out there
next to that special someone,

91
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:10,201
that one who's going away.
But you're still here...

92
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:11,570
It's too early for this!

93
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:14,136
Baby.

94
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:20,743
...gettin' on down that road, and this time,
hold on and don't ever let go.

95
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:38,834
Kim! Kim!

96
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:12,060
Shit!

97
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:29,080
Man, this thing is fucked!

98
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:32,852
Of course, on the one day
we can't afford to stop and get a flat.

99
00:15:32,978 --> 00:15:35,424
We'd be fine if your drum kit
didn't take up so much space.

100
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:39,019
It wasn't my idea
to take out the spare tire, Kimberly.

101
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:42,531
Whatever. Let's just call AAA.
Can you hand me my bag?

102
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:45,524
Well, do we even know where we are?

103
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:52,265
GPS can't even find us on my phone.

104
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:53,867
No, we're not on a private road,

105
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:56,071
we're in the middle
of a state highway right now.

106
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:57,607
Why is it so hot?

107
00:15:57,669 --> 00:15:58,875
We can't help you.

108
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:00,644
Well, yeah, thanks for nothing.

109
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:02,185
Best of luck.

110
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,885
The closest place is four hours from here.

111
00:16:06,578 --> 00:16:07,784
And it's closed.

112
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:09,848
Why? It's so early.

113
00:16:10,215 --> 00:16:13,594
The chick on the phone
sounded like she was at a bar.

114
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:15,659
Which reminds me.

115
00:16:17,556 --> 00:16:19,331
Wait, you're not serious, Kim.

116
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:23,032
What? It's not like we're going anywhere.

117
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:32,379
Warm beer.

118
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:53,159
Guys! Car!

119
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:58,670
Great. I was seriously thinking
who I'd have to eat first.

120
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,038
It was you, by the way.

121
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,742
Youngest!

122
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,410
Can we offer you a ride?

123
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:15,423
Is there a town close by?
AAA said that there's nothing for miles.

124
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:17,857
Yeah, we're pretty far out.

125
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,453
Actually, the closest town's
quite a way south.

126
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,226
You're gonna want to go
to Pete's Auto Body.

127
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:24,668
- Okay.
- Talk to Pete.

128
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:26,760
Yeah, but he's not going to be there
until tomorrow, though.

129
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,936
Why don't you come to our place?
Just until we can get a hold of Pete.

130
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:37,140
Thanks, a lot, really, but we're good.
We're used to sleeping in the van.

131
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:38,203
You know, Betty...

132
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:41,248
I wonder if the camper over
at the Kensington's

133
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:43,718
has the same size tire as that van?

134
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:46,847
I'm sure they have a spare.
Bet the boys could fix you right up.

135
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,787
Yeah. I guess. I mean, we could...

136
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:54,464
No. No, no, no, we're good, we're good.
Thank you, though. Really.

137
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:58,298
Well...

138
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:01,129
Suit yourselves.

139
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:02,964
Goodbye.

140
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:08,135
- Wait!
- What? What are you doing?

141
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,044
We don't know where we are,
we haven't seen another car in an hour...

142
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:14,481
Am I the only one who thinks it's not
a good idea to go with a couple of weirdos?

143
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,521
Look at us. Look at them.
We're the weirdos.

144
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,417
I'd way rather go with them
than a bunch of rape-y dudes.

145
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:38,599
So are you girls students?

146
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:42,009
No, we're not. We are in a band.

147
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,880
Fun! A rock and roll group!

148
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:47,212
Yeah.

149
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:48,751
We play jazz.

150
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:50,181
Smooth jazz.

151
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,646
I do love jazz.

152
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,428
So, how long have you guys lived out here?

153
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:03,561
I don't know.

154
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:05,124
Since the war.

155
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,565
Is that a trap or something?

156
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,006
It probably was

157
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:13,807
but broken now.

158
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:15,208
Coyotes.

159
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:19,977
This is your fault.

160
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,018
All right.

161
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:35,825
You don't have to worry about locking it up.
There's no one around for miles.

162
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:05,192
Come on.

163
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:11,497
Here we are. The bathroom is right there.

164
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:13,000
Nap, shower...

165
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,062
Anything that you need to do.

166
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:18,905
The Kensington's
are going to be coming over for supper.

167
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:22,212
It's just so wonderful
to have some company!

168
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:25,079
I'm sorry about Alex...

169
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:26,908
What did you say?

170
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:29,612
It's just so wonderful
to have some company!

171
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:31,279
No, before that.

172
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,649
I will whip up some supper for us.

173
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:35,155
Thank you.

174
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,652
What the fuck?

175
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:41,092
They aren't old, right?

176
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:44,259
But they act like they're 80,
and from the '50s.

177
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:47,035
I bet they have the nastiest sex!

178
00:20:48,026 --> 00:20:50,233
Wait. Did you guys hear that?

179
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:52,302
What are you talking about?

180
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:55,038
Kim, this totally looks like you!

181
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,746
You're, like, a hot milkmaid.

182
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,510
They definitely have the nastiest sex.

183
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,247
My cousin's a Sunday school teacher
and she loves anal.

184
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,586
I really don't think I'm hearing things.

185
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:09,626
You're so gross.

186
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:10,785
You started it.

187
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:12,795
This bed is like a freaking cloud.

188
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,797
I don't think it's a good idea for us
to take a nap here, Ava.

189
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:17,026
Hey, you totally had sex with that old guy

190
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:19,626
just 'cause he had, like,
a Tempur-Pedic mattress.

191
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:21,432
Okay, he wasn't old.

192
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,067
- Old.
- He was pretty old.

193
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:26,142
He was 49. That is not old.

194
00:21:26,364 --> 00:21:28,970
- That's so old.
- It's old even for me.

195
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:35,179
Stop talking to me.

196
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:38,450
She's done it again.

197
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,383
This is beautiful.

198
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:42,148
Just beautiful!

199
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,829
How lucky we are that you have access
to these old family recipes, Betty.

200
00:21:50,922 --> 00:21:53,198
So, you guys have a tire?

201
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:57,601
For the van! Yes, sure.

202
00:21:57,662 --> 00:21:59,573
The boys will fix that up for you.
Won't you, boys?

203
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:06,541
Sorry, are these your sons?

204
00:22:07,105 --> 00:22:08,448
You look so young.

205
00:22:10,142 --> 00:22:12,383
You just made Bunny's year with that one.

206
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:13,923
Actually, we adopted the boys.

207
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:17,752
It's a long, sad story.

208
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:21,054
Let's give thanks.

209
00:22:24,956 --> 00:22:27,300
O Divine One,

210
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,967
we offer our gratitude for this beast,
for this blood,

211
00:22:32,998 --> 00:22:34,671
for these vessels of anew.

212
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:38,442
We bow to you, for You are all-knowing.

213
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:42,542
We offer ourselves to you,
for You are the Master.

214
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:45,748
Amen?

215
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:51,793
What exactly is in this dish?

216
00:22:51,883 --> 00:22:53,362
It's a Sunday roast.

217
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:58,328
I probably should have mentioned before
that I don't eat meat.

218
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:01,865
I see.

219
00:23:03,094 --> 00:23:08,009
You know, there are some who just
don't have the luxury to not eat meat.

220
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:11,406
Only the strong survive! Right, boys?

221
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:17,713
- So, are you guys Russian or something?
- Russian?

222
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:20,748
That is a good one!

223
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:23,588
No, Raymond and Bunny, they're just,

224
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:27,492
very traditional,
set in their ways, as are we!

225
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:32,434
But it is no matter. Everything's fine.
You don't have to eat the meat.

226
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,096
- No.
- It's actually really good.

227
00:23:37,095 --> 00:23:38,335
It is!

228
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,873
I thought there was four of you.

229
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,240
Enough!

230
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:25,711
This place feels like a bad acid trip.
Those twins?

231
00:24:26,878 --> 00:24:29,620
What the fuck was that prayer all about?

232
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:31,183
Why do you have to be so negative?

233
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:33,990
Seriously?

234
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:35,925
Yeah.

235
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:38,431
- So we got a flat.
- What the fuck.

236
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:43,337
We're here. We got a roof over our head.
We got free dinner.

237
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:46,268
What's the big deal?

238
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:48,777
Why can't you just make the best of things?

239
00:24:50,168 --> 00:24:53,581
I don't know,
because we have a show to play tomorrow?

240
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:57,679
And we're stuck in some house
in the middle of nowhere

241
00:24:57,742 --> 00:25:00,484
on some road that doesn't seem to exist?

242
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:05,559
Sorry if I'm being a bummer by pointing
this out, but this isn't exactly normal.

243
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:13,336
Nothing's ever your fault.

244
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:15,863
- What?
- Nothing.

245
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:17,935
Just...

246
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:21,374
Miss Alex, that's all.

247
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:27,081
If she were here,
everything would be different.

248
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:29,911
Yeah, so do I. Obviously.

249
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:32,519
Then why did you let her leave?

250
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:34,382
What did you say?

251
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:39,121
You let her leave that night.

252
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:45,833
You wanted to fuck some nobody asshole
in some shithole club.

253
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:49,463
I hope it was good.

254
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:53,071
I hope it was really good.

255
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:59,248
Why are you doing this right now?

256
00:25:59,404 --> 00:26:02,408
You know that I loved her more than any...

257
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:04,043
It's not funny, Kim!

258
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:06,749
You should see your face right now!

259
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:09,993
What the fuck, man? That's so messed up!

260
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,528
All right, I didn't make her
leave that night.

261
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:17,658
It's not my... My God! My God!
Okay, I'm gonna get you a towel!

262
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:23,497
Jesus.

263
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,707
Hey! They're really sick!

264
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:29,644
Ava and Kim can't stop throwing up this,
like, black stuff all over the place.

265
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:30,873
We have to do something.

266
00:26:30,935 --> 00:26:34,246
Dear. It's probably the meat.

267
00:26:35,006 --> 00:26:36,349
Newcomers!

268
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:39,480
Well, the first time is the worst time.

269
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:41,421
What is in that meat? What is going on?

270
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:43,015
I've got just the thing.

271
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:46,221
They'll be fine as soon
as they get some medicine.

272
00:26:46,284 --> 00:26:47,661
Nice play!

273
00:26:59,964 --> 00:27:03,969
Thank you so much.
This medicine's wonderful.

274
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:05,342
Of course, darling.

275
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:09,417
See? All better now.

276
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:12,114
Are you sure you don't want to change
into something more comfortable?

277
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:13,952
Yeah, I'm sure, thank you.

278
00:27:14,546 --> 00:27:17,550
- Shouldn't we be calling a doctor, though?
- Don't you worry.

279
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:20,188
Dale knows what he's doing.

280
00:27:20,618 --> 00:27:22,256
Old family recipe.

281
00:27:23,388 --> 00:27:24,594
Yeah, from the Old World?

282
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:27,227
Yes, young lady, from the Old World.

283
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,435
But I swear,
if I could market this, I'd be rich.

284
00:27:36,568 --> 00:27:38,343
Sleep tight.

285
00:27:45,276 --> 00:27:46,721
Guys, we have got to go!

286
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:49,156
You need to calm down.

287
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:54,789
Let's just get some sleep, then Pete
or the boys can come fix our van.

288
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,530
What? No. No, no, no. We go take their tire
and we get on the road. I will pay for a hotel.

289
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:01,895
I'm not going anywhere.

290
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:04,401
How would we even get to the van tonight?

291
00:28:05,763 --> 00:28:07,401
I'm going to bed.

292
00:28:07,932 --> 00:28:10,105
I'm so, so sleepy.

293
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:15,211
How are you guys acting
like nothing is wrong right now?

294
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:17,184
I wish Alex was here.

295
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,119
I know. Me, too.

296
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:23,749
But she's dead.

297
00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:26,658
I wish Sadie was a better friend to Alex.

298
00:29:57,575 --> 00:30:00,283
I had more faith in you than that.

299
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:05,826
Why'd you leave me?

300
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:14,399
My God!

301
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,374
Let us rejoice!

302
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:29,447
Let us rejoice!

303
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:31,651
Hear now this creed!

304
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:36,357
Contentment thou shall find
through suffering

305
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:39,124
and through long years in it.

306
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:42,664
For the damned do not grow old.

307
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:47,736
Their minds are nourished by living
in the dark waters of the gods.

308
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:50,095
Knowest thou.

309
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:52,908
Thou has begun thy transition.

310
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:56,972
Thou has begun thy transition.

311
00:30:58,703 --> 00:31:00,910
Thou has begun thy transition.

312
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:05,186
Thou has begun thy transition.

313
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:09,685
Thou has begun thy transition.

314
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:15,453
The damned do not grow old.

315
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:17,530
Thou has begun thy transition.

316
00:31:17,922 --> 00:31:22,166
The damned do not grow old.

317
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:25,537
Thou has begun thy transition.

318
00:31:25,596 --> 00:31:28,099
Thou has begun thy transition.

319
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,009
Thou has begun thy transition.

320
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:45,753
Sadie.

321
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:48,224
Hi, Sadie.

322
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:54,227
Don't be a baby.

323
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:11,377
Sadie.

324
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,292
Sadie.

325
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:30,403
Sadie.

326
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:49,217
You left me there to die.

327
00:32:50,882 --> 00:32:53,089
Now we can all be together.

328
00:33:26,184 --> 00:33:27,185
Hey!

329
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:29,890
Black.

330
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:32,127
Black. Pink, black.

331
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,567
I like pink. Go with pink.

332
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,968
Of course you do.

333
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:38,439
Well, you look great in it.

334
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,311
- You want to wear the black, I know.
- Of course I want to wear the black!

335
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:43,537
I...

336
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:57,620
Now, where were we?

337
00:33:57,682 --> 00:33:58,717
Lucas, what just happened?

338
00:33:58,783 --> 00:34:02,629
Seems I lost my train of thought.
Well, folks, the mind is a tricky demon.

339
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:03,757
Lucas?

340
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:05,232
I'd say all you...

341
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:06,359
Lucas, are you okay?

342
00:34:06,757 --> 00:34:07,963
I gotta call you back.

343
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:11,131
...keep on moving forward.

344
00:34:11,195 --> 00:34:14,404
Try not to linger
on the things you left behind.

345
00:34:14,932 --> 00:34:17,503
Because you cannot undo
what's been done...

346
00:34:18,402 --> 00:34:20,404
And ain't nobody gonna...

347
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,491
Hello? Hey! Are you okay?

348
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:40,766
Miss, I...

349
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:55,111
Hi, hey.

350
00:34:55,506 --> 00:34:57,281
Lucas, are you okay?

351
00:34:57,475 --> 00:34:58,681
Yeah.

352
00:34:58,743 --> 00:35:00,086
God damn it, don't do that to me.

353
00:35:00,144 --> 00:35:01,919
All I heard was this god-awful
screeching sound.

354
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:04,687
I thought you were, like,
getting attacked or something.

355
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:08,390
When are you coming home already?
When are you coming home?

356
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:11,233
Baby? Talk to me.

357
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:16,071
Lucas? Babe, what's up?

358
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:23,939
Honey, I gotta call you back, okay?
I'm sorry. I love you.

359
00:35:32,743 --> 00:35:35,747
- 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
- Yeah, I just hit a woman with my car.

360
00:35:35,813 --> 00:35:40,057
You just hit a woman with your car...
With your car. Was she on foot?

361
00:35:40,117 --> 00:35:44,896
Yes. She's in the road right now,
and she's very badly hurt.

362
00:35:44,956 --> 00:35:46,765
- Okay.
- She's very badly hurt.

363
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:48,360
Okay, we got it. Where are you right now?

364
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:49,427
I'm on...

365
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:53,239
I'm on... I don't know where I am.

366
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:54,901
You know what,
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

367
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:56,946
Sir, I'm sorry, sir, you're breaking up.

368
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:59,538
I said I'm in the middle of nowhere.

369
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:03,143
What do I do?

370
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:06,154
Okay, sir, I can't send an ambulance
if I don't know where you are.

371
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,518
Is there a cross street?

372
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:10,286
No. There's some lights up ahead.

373
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:13,591
I think there's a town
a few miles ahead? I'm...

374
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,927
So there's a town. Can you tell me
anything about where that...

375
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,296
I can't find it on my GPS. I'm sorry.

376
00:36:18,422 --> 00:36:20,595
Okay, I'm patching you through
to Emergency Medical. One moment.

377
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:22,035
Okay.

378
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:30,812
Hello? Can you hurry up, please?

379
00:36:30,868 --> 00:36:32,643
Sir? Sir, it's okay. Are you there?

380
00:36:32,703 --> 00:36:34,649
Yes! Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

381
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:37,151
I'm a certified EMT. Are you with her now?

382
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:38,311
Yeah.

383
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:40,617
Great. Can you describe
her condition to me?

384
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:41,918
She's...

385
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,657
She's got a head trauma,

386
00:36:45,716 --> 00:36:49,664
and some broken bones,
multiple broken bones, I think.

387
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,256
Okay. Anything else?

388
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:56,530
She's got a compound fracture of her knee.
I think.

389
00:36:56,694 --> 00:36:58,037
- Is she breathing?
- Yeah.

390
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:00,832
- Okay. Is she conscious?
- God damn it, Claire.

391
00:37:00,898 --> 00:37:03,071
- All right, sir, you're doing fine. Sir?
- Yeah.

392
00:37:03,134 --> 00:37:05,011
Lucas? Lucas?

393
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:07,077
How do you know my name?

394
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:08,708
We have your cell.

395
00:37:09,573 --> 00:37:11,780
- Right. Of course. Yeah.
- You need to trust us, okay?

396
00:37:11,842 --> 00:37:12,912
Okay.

397
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:15,651
Sir, she's in critical condition
and we can't seem to locate you,

398
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:17,624
so we'd like you to try and move her.

399
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:19,217
You want me to move her?

400
00:37:19,283 --> 00:37:21,923
You said there's a town up ahead, right?

401
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:31,570
Okay.

402
00:37:33,664 --> 00:37:36,270
All right. Okay. You're okay.

403
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:51,218
Okay. I've got her in the backseat.
We are driving.

404
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:54,092
I am heading south. Are you still with me?

405
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:58,023
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, we're here. Just stay with us, okay?

406
00:37:58,089 --> 00:37:59,397
You're doing just great, Lucas.

407
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:03,337
There's a lot of cracks in the windshield.
I cannot see very well.

408
00:38:03,394 --> 00:38:06,204
- What am I looking for when I get there?
- We're gonna talk you through it.

409
00:38:06,263 --> 00:38:08,903
All right, good.
We're doing about 80 right now.

410
00:38:08,966 --> 00:38:11,173
I think I can go faster.
I'm gonna go faster.

411
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:12,612
- Lucas?
- Yeah?

412
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:16,709
Can you say something to her?
You know, in case she can hear you.

413
00:38:21,278 --> 00:38:23,451
I'll do everything I can.

414
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:31,093
Lucas, tell us when you're close.

415
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,157
- Okay, just got into town.
- Okay.

416
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:34,997
Okay, there's shops.

417
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:39,166
I see a barber shop,
I see there's a tattoo parlor, a church...

418
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,870
Do you see any people?
Anyone on the side of the road?

419
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:43,309
- Anyone that you can ask for help?
- No.

420
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,107
No, I don't see anyone.
There's nobody. Not yet.

421
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:46,204
What about the oncoming traffic?

422
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,977
Can you flash your lights
at the oncoming traffic?

423
00:38:48,038 --> 00:38:49,847
No, no, I don't see anyone.

424
00:38:50,274 --> 00:38:52,311
There's no oncoming traffic,
or there's no people?

425
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:54,218
- Okay, wait a minute.
- Okay. Lucas, you need...

426
00:38:54,278 --> 00:38:56,656
Wait, there's a sign up here.
Okay, it's a hospital sign.

427
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:59,593
I think I'm pulling up
into a local hospital.

428
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:11,501
Dispatch to Regional, he's located
a medical facility of some sort.

429
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:13,940
Be advised, no contact local PD.

430
00:39:14,598 --> 00:39:16,544
Lucas, we'll stay with you
till you've made contact.

431
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,479
Just make sure you stay with us until then.

432
00:39:19,603 --> 00:39:22,049
Help! I need some help!

433
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:28,485
Hello? Hello, I have an emergency!

434
00:39:30,247 --> 00:39:32,227
Is there anybody here?

435
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:36,194
Is there some sort of problem?
Did he run into a problem?

436
00:39:36,253 --> 00:39:37,288
Hello?

437
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:38,856
Sir, is there a problem?

438
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:40,766
Lucas, can you...

439
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:42,930
...no one seems to know.

440
00:39:42,993 --> 00:39:45,564
But that experience must have been
a serious emotional shock.

441
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,209
You think I imagined all of it, don't you?
You think I'm insane?

442
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:51,837
I didn't say that. I don't mean that.

443
00:39:51,902 --> 00:39:53,939
What the fuck? Hey!

444
00:39:54,004 --> 00:39:55,677
...I'm not given to imagining...

445
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:57,946
Sir, what's the problem here?

446
00:39:58,742 --> 00:39:59,982
We need you to talk to us.

447
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:01,682
Lucas, we can help.

448
00:40:02,046 --> 00:40:03,992
Okay, okay, okay.

449
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:06,517
Sir?

450
00:40:08,452 --> 00:40:11,262
Sir, we need you on the line
telling us what you see.

451
00:40:11,455 --> 00:40:14,595
We need you to keep talking to us. Sir?

452
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:16,964
- There's no one here. It's...
- Okay.

453
00:40:17,027 --> 00:40:19,166
- It's abandoned or something.
- Okay. Calm down, sir.

454
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,301
There's no one fucking here!

455
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:25,306
Sir, I need you to calm down.
I'm sure there's someone nearby.

456
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:29,345
I'm going to need you to find the nearest
surgeon, nurse, whoever you can find.

457
00:40:29,406 --> 00:40:32,546
- There's no one here. Do you understand?
- I need you to find the closest person.

458
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,611
Okay, sir.

459
00:40:33,677 --> 00:40:35,281
I'm looking. I do not see anyone.

460
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:39,293
Okay, how is the victim? How is the victim?

461
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:40,521
I don't know what's happening.

462
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:44,122
Lucas! What about the girl?
How's she doing?

463
00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:55,968
Shit! Fuck!

464
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,407
Lucas, how's she doing?

465
00:40:58,469 --> 00:40:59,743
Not good!

466
00:40:59,803 --> 00:41:02,215
- Not good. Okay, what's happening?
- What?

467
00:41:02,806 --> 00:41:05,309
Her leg is... It's broken. It's...

468
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:06,480
Okay.

469
00:41:06,543 --> 00:41:08,716
- She's bleeding really, really bad.
- All right.

470
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:14,355
All right. Focus.
You need to stop the bleeding.

471
00:41:14,418 --> 00:41:16,398
I need you to look
for anything you can use.

472
00:41:16,453 --> 00:41:18,524
- Like a tourniquet?
- Yes.

473
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:20,865
All right. I got it,
I got it, I got it. I got it.

474
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:22,666
Now, wrap it around the leg.

475
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:24,905
All right.

476
00:41:24,962 --> 00:41:26,566
Okay, how tight do I make it?

477
00:41:26,664 --> 00:41:28,769
- As tight as you can.
- Okay.

478
00:41:31,268 --> 00:41:33,714
Something's happening! All right.
She's moving, she's moving!

479
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:35,808
- I don't know what to do!
- Sir, you need to focus.

480
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:37,249
Well, then, tell what I'm supposed to do!

481
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:39,514
Okay, Lucas, is she responsive?

482
00:41:39,743 --> 00:41:41,518
To what exactly?
I don't know what that means!

483
00:41:41,578 --> 00:41:42,886
How is her breathing?

484
00:41:43,814 --> 00:41:45,191
It's upsetting. She's...

485
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:46,819
There's blood bubbling out of her mouth.

486
00:41:47,184 --> 00:41:48,288
He's losing her. He's losing her.

487
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:50,195
I need to hear it!

488
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:55,634
- Can you hear it?
- Yes!

489
00:41:56,794 --> 00:41:59,138
Okay, now listen carefully.
You're going to have to intubate her.

490
00:41:59,196 --> 00:42:00,436
Do you know what that means?

491
00:42:00,497 --> 00:42:01,942
Stick a tube in her throat.

492
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:04,172
Exactly. Now, you want to find
a specific kit for that.

493
00:42:04,234 --> 00:42:07,306
It's pretty standard stuff,
but it's specific.

494
00:42:08,939 --> 00:42:10,816
- Lucas?
- Okay, what am I looking for?

495
00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:12,581
A package or a pack or a bag.

496
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:15,681
Probably has an indicator on the front,
but it can vary in shape or size.

497
00:42:15,746 --> 00:42:16,884
What am I looking for?

498
00:42:16,947 --> 00:42:18,927
Okay, it's best just to look
for the word "intubation,"

499
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:22,396
or "tracheal," "endotracheal,"
"tracheal intubation. " Any of those.

500
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:25,024
Or "airway," "airway intubation,"
"airway management kit,"

501
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:26,796
"EMS airway." That's the one we use.

502
00:42:26,857 --> 00:42:30,134
Anything that has those words on it.
Just tell me what you find.

503
00:42:30,194 --> 00:42:33,664
Lucas, tell me what you find.
Have you seen any?

504
00:42:34,264 --> 00:42:36,335
- Can you see anything that looks like that?
- Okay, I got it.

505
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,847
Okay, good. First, open the kit,
look for the curved laryngoscope blade.

506
00:42:39,903 --> 00:42:41,576
It's a metal hand tool.

507
00:42:41,638 --> 00:42:43,208
No, there's no blade. It's just the tube.

508
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:44,945
- It's just the tube.
- That's right.

509
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:46,613
You're going to have to do it manually.

510
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:49,817
First, identify the glottis. It's a little
fleshy valve at the back of her throat.

511
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,915
Feel for the breath.

512
00:42:50,981 --> 00:42:52,517
You want me to stick my fingers
in her throat?

513
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,256
Yes. You have to. It's the intubation.

514
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:58,095
And have it ready.
You need to hurry, you need to do it now.

515
00:43:00,758 --> 00:43:02,431
Okay. Okay.

516
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:06,365
All right. Okay. Okay.

517
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:14,615
You must go farther, Lucas.
All the way to the back of the tongue.

518
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:19,521
- Now do it.
- Okay.

519
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,623
Insert the tube. Don't hesitate.

520
00:43:23,947 --> 00:43:26,223
Keep going. Keep going.

521
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:30,156
- Fuck! She's biting me! She's biting me!
- What happened?

522
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,631
She's...

523
00:43:32,756 --> 00:43:34,360
- What's happening?
- Something's wrong.

524
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:35,870
She's close to death.

525
00:43:35,926 --> 00:43:37,166
Who is this?

526
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:41,366
Hello? Who is this?

527
00:43:41,432 --> 00:43:44,709
I'm a surgeon, Lucas.
I've been listening since you arrived.

528
00:43:44,768 --> 00:43:46,645
- Okay.
- He's here to help.

529
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:48,717
Do you want to save her life?

530
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:50,341
Yes.

531
00:43:50,407 --> 00:43:53,388
Then whatever you do,
do not remove your hand from her throat.

532
00:43:53,444 --> 00:43:56,914
Trust me, the tube is not set
and it's the only thing giving her oxygen,

533
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,290
the only thing keeping her alive.

534
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:01,226
But it's also killing her.

535
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:03,287
She's got several broken ribs
on her right side

536
00:44:03,353 --> 00:44:06,596
and the diaphragm is unable
to compress the lung. She can't breathe.

537
00:44:06,657 --> 00:44:07,863
You must compress the lung.

538
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:10,570
- How do you know that?
- You must compress the lung.

539
00:44:10,627 --> 00:44:11,662
I didn't tell you that.

540
00:44:11,728 --> 00:44:13,139
You must compress the lung.

541
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,040
No, no, no, look, I need a minute here.
I'm not really sure what I...

542
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,170
Compress the lung.

543
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:20,272
I must compress the lung! I must...
Fine, what the fuck does that mean?

544
00:44:20,337 --> 00:44:23,216
First, use your free hand
to expose the rib cage.

545
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:26,885
Okay. Okay.

546
00:44:28,145 --> 00:44:31,126
- Okay. Now what?
- Slowly. Carefully.

547
00:44:31,181 --> 00:44:33,525
- You can do this, Lucas.
- Now what?

548
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:35,255
Make an incision.

549
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:39,464
- An incision?
- Make an incision.

550
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:41,200
You have to.

551
00:44:42,993 --> 00:44:44,063
All right.

552
00:44:52,136 --> 00:44:54,047
Okay. Okay.

553
00:44:54,304 --> 00:44:56,284
You have the blade.

554
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,446
Five to seven inches.
Just below the rib cage.

555
00:45:03,413 --> 00:45:04,721
Slowly.

556
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:07,020
Slowly.

557
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:09,889
Slowly.

558
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:15,693
Okay.

559
00:45:16,593 --> 00:45:18,504
- Find the lung.
- Okay.

560
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,550
I got it.

561
00:45:38,882 --> 00:45:40,691
Compress the lung.

562
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,558
Fuck!

563
00:46:50,554 --> 00:46:51,658
Fuck!

564
00:47:22,786 --> 00:47:24,197
What the fuck?

565
00:47:24,321 --> 00:47:25,322
What the fuck?

566
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:27,725
Fuck!

567
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:35,502
Fuck! Fuck!

568
00:48:54,277 --> 00:48:55,312
Claire?

569
00:49:02,586 --> 00:49:04,588
- Claire's not here.
- We're still on.

570
00:49:04,654 --> 00:49:07,726
We're going to have
to talk about this, Lucas.

571
00:49:08,158 --> 00:49:09,967
I don't deserve this.

572
00:49:10,994 --> 00:49:12,166
Really?

573
00:49:13,964 --> 00:49:15,944
Why don't you elaborate?

574
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,040
Elaborate.

575
00:49:21,638 --> 00:49:26,485
She was out in the middle of the road,
in the middle of the fucking night,

576
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:28,819
in the middle of nowhere.

577
00:49:28,879 --> 00:49:32,019
How am I supposed to be expect...
I mean it's...

578
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:37,329
It's an extraordinary circumstance, okay?
How am I supposed to be...

579
00:49:37,387 --> 00:49:38,661
Lucas, it's okay.

580
00:49:38,755 --> 00:49:40,632
Absolutely okay.

581
00:49:40,857 --> 00:49:42,029
Right. Right.

582
00:49:42,092 --> 00:49:44,333
- You had no way of knowing.
- No way of knowing.

583
00:49:44,428 --> 00:49:46,999
She was in the middle of the road,
in the middle of the fucking night...

584
00:49:47,063 --> 00:49:49,600
- In the middle of nowhere.
- At night.

585
00:49:49,766 --> 00:49:52,508
It doesn't have to be your fault, Lucas.

586
00:49:53,003 --> 00:49:54,812
Go be with your wife.

587
00:49:56,907 --> 00:49:59,012
I can just walk out of here?

588
00:49:59,342 --> 00:50:00,446
- Yes.
- Yes.

589
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:01,921
- Yes.
- Yes.

590
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:03,489
I can leave?

591
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:04,651
- Yes.
- Yes.

592
00:50:04,714 --> 00:50:05,749
Yes.

593
00:50:06,817 --> 00:50:08,558
And you aren't tricking me again?

594
00:50:08,618 --> 00:50:09,653
- No.
- No.

595
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:11,289
- No.
- No, Lucas.

596
00:50:12,155 --> 00:50:13,964
Find the locker room.

597
00:50:14,124 --> 00:50:15,467
You'll see.

598
00:52:23,486 --> 00:52:27,059
Do I need to worry about what's back there?

599
00:52:27,424 --> 00:52:29,062
- No.
- No.

600
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:31,195
Absolutely not.

601
00:52:33,129 --> 00:52:34,904
You were never here.

602
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:38,939
Okay.

603
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:44,385
I'm hanging up now.

604
00:52:49,112 --> 00:52:50,853
That's good, Lucas.

605
00:52:55,452 --> 00:52:56,829
Good night.

606
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:16,274
I'll take a beer and a shot of whiskey.

607
00:54:17,867 --> 00:54:19,574
You forgot to shut the door.

608
00:54:19,636 --> 00:54:20,944
No, I didn't.

609
00:54:21,504 --> 00:54:23,006
It didn't latch.

610
00:54:23,807 --> 00:54:25,286
Come on, Al.

611
00:54:25,341 --> 00:54:27,981
I been on my feet for hours.
Give me a beer.

612
00:54:31,281 --> 00:54:32,783
First the door.

613
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:36,524
Seriously? It's shut. It's fine.

614
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:40,224
Sounds pretty sure of herself, Al.

615
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:46,840
At the same time, being sure is sort of
a fancy way of being lazy.

616
00:54:48,665 --> 00:54:50,440
You want to go check the door?

617
00:54:51,468 --> 00:54:52,811
I mean...

618
00:54:54,337 --> 00:54:57,443
You can see from here
it's not shut all the way.

619
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:02,819
I'll buy you a beer.

620
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:06,561
Well, when you put it like that...

621
00:55:08,685 --> 00:55:10,995
All right, everybody,
put your hands on the tables!

622
00:55:11,554 --> 00:55:13,864
Cooperate and we'll get this over with
real fuckin' quick!

623
00:55:13,923 --> 00:55:16,426
- You! Sit the fuck down!
- Hang on, buddy.

624
00:55:16,526 --> 00:55:18,233
Put your hands on the table.

625
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:22,103
What the fuck part
of "put your hands on the table"

626
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:24,577
is so hard for you to understand?

627
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:31,875
Maybe before we all get carried away here,

628
00:55:31,941 --> 00:55:35,479
we stop and think for a minute.

629
00:55:35,812 --> 00:55:37,485
- How's that sound?
- That sounds great.

630
00:55:37,547 --> 00:55:41,154
Now, I know that one shitty bar
might look just like any other.

631
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:44,064
But here's some free advice.

632
00:55:44,587 --> 00:55:48,899
Get back on whatever road it was
that brought you here and keep moving.

633
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:51,230
'Cause I guarantee you

634
00:55:51,294 --> 00:55:53,205
that robbin' this place

635
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,237
is way more trouble than it's worth.

636
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:58,108
This is not a robbery!

637
00:56:01,905 --> 00:56:03,043
This is my sister.

638
00:56:05,608 --> 00:56:07,281
Her name is Jesse,

639
00:56:08,645 --> 00:56:11,148
and I know that she's in this town.

640
00:56:11,915 --> 00:56:13,986
Now, I don't want to hurt anybody.

641
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:16,690
But I'm telling you right the fuck now,

642
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:19,097
I'll do anything to find her.

643
00:56:19,155 --> 00:56:21,965
Put your fucking hands on the bar!

644
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:24,930
Thank you.

645
00:56:26,596 --> 00:56:28,007
Anyone.

646
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:30,837
Anybody seen her?

647
00:56:36,439 --> 00:56:37,816
Where'd you get that tattoo?

648
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:42,586
Did you get that around here?

649
00:56:54,357 --> 00:56:55,495
Fuck!

650
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:10,181
I don't know if I can kill you,
but I bet that it hurts like a motherfucker!

651
00:57:12,876 --> 00:57:15,015
One more step! One more fucking step!

652
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:26,629
Last time. Have you seen her?

653
00:57:28,558 --> 00:57:29,559
Yeah.

654
00:57:30,493 --> 00:57:32,234
Yeah? Where?

655
00:57:32,395 --> 00:57:34,602
Nowhere you can go, big shot.

656
00:57:35,198 --> 00:57:37,269
You'll fucking take me!

657
00:57:40,637 --> 00:57:42,480
Move, motherfucker!

658
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:48,711
Get in. Get in. And drive.

659
00:57:52,982 --> 00:57:54,222
Fuckin' go, man!

660
00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:59,290
Where are my road warriors at,

661
00:57:59,355 --> 00:58:02,598
my veteran road hogs out there
tearing up the pavement

662
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:04,195
where the rubber meets the road?

663
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:09,005
You may be an old dog,
but you can still learn some new tricks.

664
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:10,635
So what's stopping you?

665
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,907
You don't owe the world shit.

666
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:16,212
It's time to live your own life,
and if someone's dumb enough to stand...

667
00:58:16,272 --> 00:58:19,344
You don't got a lot of time
before the whole valley finds out,

668
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:21,286
but you know that, don't ya?

669
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:24,382
Yeah. Yeah. If I need you to,
I'm gonna have you drive off the road.

670
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:26,884
You don't want to do that.

671
00:58:27,283 --> 00:58:30,230
It looks like the desert,
but if you go out there,

672
00:58:30,286 --> 00:58:31,697
you might not come back.

673
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:52,083
What the fuck are we doin' here?

674
00:58:53,042 --> 00:58:54,680
It's around back.

675
00:59:10,893 --> 00:59:13,032
- In there.
- In where? What?

676
00:59:13,896 --> 00:59:15,534
How do we get in?

677
00:59:18,301 --> 00:59:19,302
Through the door.

678
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:24,650
Quit being so fuckin' mysterious!

679
00:59:32,248 --> 00:59:33,283
Sorry.

680
00:59:34,317 --> 00:59:35,660
That's okay, Danny.

681
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:40,323
How did you know my name?

682
00:59:44,827 --> 00:59:47,398
You're fucked, Danny!

683
00:59:47,463 --> 00:59:48,771
And you don't even know it yet.

684
01:00:21,531 --> 01:00:22,771
Don't you want to see her?

685
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:27,674
Yeah.

686
01:00:58,334 --> 01:00:59,369
Jesse!

687
01:01:01,471 --> 01:01:03,849
- Jesse, it's me, Danny.
- Danny?

688
01:01:04,841 --> 01:01:06,047
Danny, what...

689
01:01:09,345 --> 01:01:10,847
Are you really here?

690
01:01:10,913 --> 01:01:12,517
I'm really here.

691
01:01:16,586 --> 01:01:18,361
My God! You're hurt.

692
01:01:18,721 --> 01:01:21,668
It's nothing. It's nothing.
I can't believe I found you.

693
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:23,335
How did you even get here?

694
01:01:25,128 --> 01:01:27,335
Man, Danny, you got old.

695
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:31,241
I've been searchin' for you for 13 years.

696
01:01:32,502 --> 01:01:34,982
You look absolutely incredible.

697
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:37,581
- Danny, wait...
- Yeah, what?

698
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:41,480
- How did you get here?
- |...

699
01:01:44,147 --> 01:01:46,684
- No. Danny, don't!
- What the hell are you doing?

700
01:01:46,749 --> 01:01:48,160
What the hell are you doing?

701
01:01:48,217 --> 01:01:50,663
I'm savin' you!
I came to get you the hell outta here!

702
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:54,126
Danny, I don't want to leave.

703
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:57,194
You don't mean that, Jesse.
Now get outta the fuckin' way.

704
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,604
- She does mean it, Danny.
- Shut up!

705
01:02:00,029 --> 01:02:02,532
She's here because she wants to be.

706
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,006
Come on, Danny.

707
01:02:09,438 --> 01:02:11,645
Okay? It's time for you to leave.

708
01:02:29,025 --> 01:02:31,062
- Danny!
- Come on.

709
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:37,606
Get your fucking hands off of me!

710
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:39,810
Turn us around.

711
01:02:41,003 --> 01:02:42,414
God damn it!

712
01:02:48,144 --> 01:02:49,487
You're such an asshole.

713
01:02:50,446 --> 01:02:51,948
I'm okay with that.

714
01:02:52,014 --> 01:02:54,119
Just let me be an asshole
and get you the hell out of here.

715
01:03:04,627 --> 01:03:05,799
Fuck.

716
01:03:08,364 --> 01:03:12,403
Danny, you're not supposed to go out there.

717
01:03:16,405 --> 01:03:19,045
If you do this, it's for you,

718
01:03:20,243 --> 01:03:21,847
it's not for me.

719
01:03:24,313 --> 01:03:25,656
I don't have a choice.

720
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:36,998
I can't see anything!

721
01:03:37,426 --> 01:03:38,734
There's nothing to see!

722
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:42,409
The fuckin' car's gonna fall apart.

723
01:03:42,498 --> 01:03:44,478
Don't slow down.

724
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:46,843
You're not supposed to be here.

725
01:03:49,238 --> 01:03:52,185
You can't stay here,
and you can't take me with you.

726
01:03:52,241 --> 01:03:54,346
I'm not leaving you behind.

727
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:56,913
You'll need your gun.

728
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:58,915
What?

729
01:03:58,981 --> 01:04:03,020
You have the gun, Danny?
You might have to blow my brains out, too.

730
01:04:03,085 --> 01:04:04,189
Stop it!

731
01:04:04,253 --> 01:04:08,531
No, you can't stop!
You can't stop, Danny, it's too late!

732
01:04:09,091 --> 01:04:10,297
Fucking stop!

733
01:04:23,105 --> 01:04:25,051
- Fuck!
- Danny...

734
01:04:29,111 --> 01:04:32,115
This place is made for people like me.

735
01:04:32,181 --> 01:04:33,990
You shouldn't be here.

736
01:04:35,818 --> 01:04:40,324
I mean, this whole time growing up,
didn't you ever think about Mom and Dad?

737
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:42,728
What do you mean?

738
01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:45,068
Come on, Danny, tell the truth.

739
01:04:46,095 --> 01:04:49,099
You've really never thought
it was my fault?

740
01:04:51,934 --> 01:04:53,345
You can't

741
01:04:53,869 --> 01:04:55,678
blame yourself for what happened.

742
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:58,309
No, you're not listening
to what I'm saying.

743
01:04:58,974 --> 01:05:02,820
- You were a kid. We were... You were...
- I killed them, Danny.

744
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:09,520
I killed them because I wanted to.

745
01:05:09,585 --> 01:05:13,032
All right? And now I'm here
because I want to be.

746
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:16,935
This place found me and I love it here.

747
01:05:28,604 --> 01:05:31,050
Jesse, help me! Jesse!

748
01:05:39,582 --> 01:05:41,118
You should've let me go.

749
01:05:41,183 --> 01:05:43,390
I just wanted to save you.

750
01:05:45,721 --> 01:05:46,961
Jesse!

751
01:05:50,393 --> 01:05:51,667
Jesse!

752
01:06:48,284 --> 01:06:50,264
What are you lookin' at?

753
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:08,346
How I'm looking forward to that.

754
01:07:08,404 --> 01:07:09,405
- Yeah.
- Hey.

755
01:07:09,472 --> 01:07:11,281
You can leave your stuff everywhere.

756
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,751
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, honey.

757
01:07:13,509 --> 01:07:16,251
I'm so glad that we got to do this
before you start school.

758
01:07:16,312 --> 01:07:19,623
- Me, too.
- Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?

759
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:21,593
We still have this one last weekend
to have fun.

760
01:07:22,084 --> 01:07:26,794
Play games and puzzles, make s'mores,
with our little girl.

761
01:07:28,023 --> 01:07:29,559
It's just exciting, sweetie.

762
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:37,040
Well, we all know the past
can be a piece of shit sometimes,

763
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:40,603
but when it catches up to you,
you'd better be ready.

764
01:07:40,669 --> 01:07:45,482
Keep your eyes on the road
and let that engine roar so loud

765
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:49,387
that you can't hear those demons
screamin' in your ear.

766
01:07:49,445 --> 01:07:52,449
Lock your doors and make those tires burn.

767
01:07:52,515 --> 01:07:56,122
Tell your family you love them
and kiss the past goodbye

768
01:07:56,185 --> 01:07:58,756
once and for all,

769
01:07:58,821 --> 01:08:02,359
because every road
has got to end somewhere.

770
01:08:02,424 --> 01:08:03,903
Am I right?

771
01:08:27,216 --> 01:08:30,254
All right.
Sure looks better in the pictures.

772
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:31,925
Got some charm.

773
01:08:32,788 --> 01:08:35,769
Listen, why don't you go unpack
and we'll have dinner ready in an hour.

774
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:37,167
Cool.

775
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,862
I'm gonna open some wine.

776
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:01,756
Do you think she's ready?

777
01:09:02,117 --> 01:09:05,291
Of course not. Is anyone ever?

778
01:09:06,755 --> 01:09:10,669
At a certain point we're just going
to have to trust in the future, right?

779
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,536
I just hope that she'll learn
to believe in herself.

780
01:09:15,598 --> 01:09:18,408
And that she'll stand up for herself.

781
01:09:19,935 --> 01:09:21,209
She will.

782
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:24,843
Question is, are you ready?

783
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:28,746
I'll be fine.

784
01:09:39,355 --> 01:09:41,631
I did not say that.

785
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:44,298
- That's a good idea though.
- Hey, honey.

786
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,361
Hey.

787
01:09:47,429 --> 01:09:49,773
Hold on, honey, let your dad get it.

788
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:53,608
This next one might be familiar
to some of you...

789
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:54,875
Who is it?

790
01:09:54,937 --> 01:09:58,612
...who don't want the night to end.
So go ahead...

791
01:09:58,941 --> 01:09:59,942
Hello?

792
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:03,582
Make some mistakes.
You can always get it right the next time.

793
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:24,571
No one's there.

794
01:10:47,656 --> 01:10:49,033
What is it?

795
01:10:50,826 --> 01:10:52,601
- Honey, call the cops.
- What?

796
01:10:52,661 --> 01:10:53,935
Call the cops, now! Go!

797
01:10:54,163 --> 01:10:55,267
Okay.

798
01:10:55,664 --> 01:10:57,268
Dad, what is it?

799
01:11:00,035 --> 01:11:01,571
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

800
01:11:01,637 --> 01:11:04,311
- Someone's trying to break into the house.
- What's the address?

801
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:06,182
It's 6-2-5-5 Bethel Lane.

802
01:11:06,241 --> 01:11:10,087
Okay, just take a deep breath.
We're going to be there in about 30 minutes.

803
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:12,625
- What?
- You are gonna be fine.

804
01:11:18,454 --> 01:11:20,297
- Dad?
- Daryl?

805
01:11:20,556 --> 01:11:21,591
Dad?

806
01:11:26,862 --> 01:11:28,603
- It's gonna take 30 minutes.
- What?

807
01:11:29,398 --> 01:11:30,468
What?

808
01:11:33,736 --> 01:11:35,545
Dad, what's going on?

809
01:11:37,573 --> 01:11:40,110
We gotta get out of here. Come here.

810
01:11:58,494 --> 01:12:00,201
What do you want?

811
01:12:03,799 --> 01:12:05,437
What do you want?

812
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:24,621
Jem! Jem!

813
01:12:42,538 --> 01:12:46,213
Why are they doing this?
What do they want from us?

814
01:12:52,447 --> 01:12:54,154
What about Jem?

815
01:14:47,963 --> 01:14:50,136
What the fuck do you want from us?
Please! What?

816
01:15:18,026 --> 01:15:21,371
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

817
01:15:22,097 --> 01:15:24,236
What are you talking about, baby?
What are you talking about?

818
01:15:24,299 --> 01:15:26,779
Listen, I'll give you anything you want,
anything you want, just please,

819
01:15:26,835 --> 01:15:28,678
let me know what I can do
to make this right, please.

820
01:15:33,542 --> 01:15:35,249
My God!

821
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:39,915
You told...

822
01:15:40,949 --> 01:15:43,691
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

823
01:15:45,454 --> 01:15:47,297
No, no! I will not... No!

824
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:51,830
No! Cait! No!

825
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:53,629
Cait!

826
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,875
No! No! No!

827
01:15:59,234 --> 01:16:01,737
God! No, no!

828
01:16:02,304 --> 01:16:03,339
No!

829
01:16:09,277 --> 01:16:10,620
No!

830
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:19,390
She was innocent.

831
01:16:19,721 --> 01:16:20,995
She was innocent!

832
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:23,533
Just kill me!

833
01:16:26,395 --> 01:16:27,965
Jem! Go!

834
01:16:28,263 --> 01:16:30,243
Go! Go!

835
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:32,068
Go!

836
01:16:32,901 --> 01:16:33,936
Go!

837
01:17:01,063 --> 01:17:02,269
Bitch!

838
01:17:15,744 --> 01:17:17,519
What do you want from us?

839
01:17:19,514 --> 01:17:21,050
What do you want from us?

840
01:17:22,884 --> 01:17:23,919
Go.

841
01:17:32,594 --> 01:17:33,595
Go!

842
01:17:56,118 --> 01:17:57,495
Thank you.

843
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,263
Thank you.

844
01:18:04,392 --> 01:18:06,201
Thank you. I'm so sorry...

845
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:10,200
Okay. I'm sorry.

846
01:19:20,001 --> 01:19:21,878
Shane. Get up.

847
01:19:26,408 --> 01:19:27,944
A little help?

848
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:44,993
Fuck!

849
01:19:51,466 --> 01:19:52,570
Fuck!

850
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:00,309
We let you go!

851
01:20:10,885 --> 01:20:13,126
Fuck! You!

852
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,164
What've we done?

853
01:21:40,475 --> 01:21:42,045
What the fuck?

854
01:21:54,622 --> 01:21:57,466
Holy shit! Run!

855
01:22:04,466 --> 01:22:06,343
Mitch! Mitch!

856
01:22:20,515 --> 01:22:21,994
What the fuck?

857
01:22:36,264 --> 01:22:37,368
What the fuck?

858
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:00,629
Un-fucking-believable.

859
01:23:14,502 --> 01:23:15,640
Fuck.

860
01:23:16,871 --> 01:23:19,647
- What about Shane?
- Fuck Shane. Shane was an ass...

861
01:23:26,347 --> 01:23:27,553
Fuck!

862
01:23:36,825 --> 01:23:38,361
What the fuck is that thing?

863
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:43,173
Holy shit.

864
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:54,577
Fuck this shit!

865
01:24:41,589 --> 01:24:43,091
Let's go home.

866
01:24:50,498 --> 01:24:53,911
Regret and remorse. Amends and atonement.

867
01:24:53,968 --> 01:24:55,709
Well, that's life, right?

868
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:58,478
This next one is for you,

869
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:02,545
for all you lost souls racing down
that long road to redemption,

870
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:05,386
and all you sinners running from your past

871
01:25:05,446 --> 01:25:09,792
but heading straight
into that pit of darkness up ahead.

872
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:12,322
We're all on the same endless highway,

873
01:25:12,387 --> 01:25:14,958
The one with no name, no exits

874
01:25:15,023 --> 01:25:18,436
looking for a way out of tonight,
and into tomorrow.

875
01:25:18,493 --> 01:25:21,838
Well, they're gonna try to stop you,
but you gotta say, "Fuck it,"

876
01:25:21,896 --> 01:25:24,934
and keep moving
because this is your highway.

877
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:30,973
And today might just be the day you
finally outrun those wicked demons

878
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:32,950
once and for all.

879
01:25:33,007 --> 01:25:36,580
And I'll be right here with you
making sure you get where you're going.

880
01:25:37,011 --> 01:25:41,559
Because in the end, we're all
just trying to find our way home.

881
01:25:42,317 --> 01:25:43,455
Right?

882
01:25:44,485 --> 01:25:45,896
Rough night?

883
01:25:49,657 --> 01:25:50,795
Yeah.

884
01:25:51,305 --> 01:26:51,218
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
