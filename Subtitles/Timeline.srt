1
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,740
Castlegard.

2
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,500
Clear!

3
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,620
- 250.
- 250 ready.

4
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,020
Clear!

5
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,420
- 300.
- 300 ready.

6
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,980
Clear!

7
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,900
He's gone.

8
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,300
It's over 100 degrees out there.
He grabs me with ice-cold hands.

9
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,740
Apart from external wounds,
everything is out of alignment.

10
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,460
Even his veins are out of alignment.
Now, wait.

11
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,620
Look at the heart.
The aorta doesn't line up.

12
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,620
And now the spine.

13
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,060
Same thing. Same shift
right across the third vertebrae.

14
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,340
This guy looks like a paper doll
got cut up and pasted back together.

15
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,260
No wallet. No ID.
Just this thing around his neck.

16
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,020
It says ITC on it,
so we called them.

17
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,300
- That outfit in the desert.
- Our biggest contributors.

18
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,940
Excuse me, gentlemen.

19
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,780
Frank Gordon, ITC.

20
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,140
I'm here to pick up
Vince Taub's body.

21
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,140
I'm Dr. Cova,
I'll take care of that paperwork.

22
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,740
Thank you.

23
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,140
Vincent Taub, huh?

24
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,700
That's Vinnie's good-luck charm.
Thank you.

25
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,460
Pretty sad when your time comes and
no one claims you but your employer.

26
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,780
- Excuse me, sheriff.
- Sure.

27
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,820
Gordon.

28
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,500
I'm picking up the body
right now.

29
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,300
- Was he alone or with Decker?
- Taub's the only one here.

30
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,420
- Get the body out of there.
- And x-rays and records.

31
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,100
Get everything, OK?
Will it be a problem?

32
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,380
No, there's no problem.
They've been very accommodating.

33
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,740
If this gets out, ITC is ruined.

34
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,740
Any idea how he ended up
in the desert?

35
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,860
I don't know. Maybe he used his
marker without enough clearance.

36
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,860
- It could be a million things.
- Not too bright.

37
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,580
He's dead, Robert.

38
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,900
Taub is dead.

39
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,060
Oh, Mr. Gordon, by the way,
what's Castlegard?

40
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,060
I heard that's the only word
he said, "Castlegard".

41
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,940
Sounds like an amusement park.

42
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,380
Listen up, class, April 4, 1357,
Castlegard, France.

43
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,020
The English army in their red uniforms
occupied the village of Castlegard.

44
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,740
The French, meanwhile,
were advancing.

45
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,940
trying to drive them out of there,
in this direction over the river,

46
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,420
past the monastery and up
and over to the heights here.

47
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,260
Just leave it, Chris, that's fine,
before you wreck the place.

48
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,460
The English army, meanwhile,
had retreated to Castle La Roque.

49
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,460
Well fortified, very strong,
very well supplied,

50
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,780
and both sides had settled in
for a long siege.

51
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,100
The French were trying to push
the English out of France.

52
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,180
Lord Oliver tries to take the fight
out of the French.

53
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,060
Now, he has a prisoner, a woman.

54
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,300
A woman of class
and a woman of nobility.

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,900
Commander Arnaut's sister,
Lady Claire.

56
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,460
He hangs her from the battlements
for all of the French forces to see.

57
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,140
Instead of demoralizing the French,
it whips them into a frenzy,

58
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,540
and they attack the castle
like madmen,

59
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,860
and they overpower the English
with sheer passion.

60
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,740
So the fortress of La Roque
fell in one night

61
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,420
because of the death of one woman.

62
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,220
Lady Claire.

63
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,180
All right, that's enough
of the academics for today.

64
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,740
Go get your hands dirty.

65
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,140
Hi, Chris.

66
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,340
Hey, Dad, I got Marek's clippers.

67
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,660
Oh, Chris, great. Thanks.
Here, hold that, will you.

68
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,020
You can move it around if you like.

69
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,340
- I thought this would be a routine trip.
- It is.

70
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,340
Last time you cut off your beard,
you sold the house

71
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,500
and we moved to Kentucky
for a year.

72
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,100
- Your mother wanted a change.
- How does this always happen to me?

73
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,580
I am older and very much wiser
than you, Have a beer.

74
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,260
It'll cool you down.
Very hot work, ironing.

75
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,020
I know something's going on.

76
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,020
The beard's coming off,
so what's really happening?

77
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,420
It's these amazing finds
we've been making.

78
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,860
Doniger's been giving us
too many tips.

79
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,340
- He's a lucky zillionaire.
- Nobody's that lucky.

80
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,860
He knows something he's not saying.
Something isn't right about this.

81
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,980
He's been ducking me.
I'm gonna get a few answers.

82
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,020
Maybe scrounge a couple of bucks.

83
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,180
Put that in my bag, would you?
And don't wrinkle it.

84
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,060
I'd appreciate it
if you don't tell anybody about this.

85
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,780
Especially Kate.

86
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,420
- Why would I tell Kate?
- Here.

87
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,420
Have a wee run round that,
would you? "Why would I tell Kate?"

88
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,340
You see me twice a year,
stay until you're bored to distraction.

89
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,420
I think the record's three weeks.

90
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,460
Maybe I'm just really beginning
to enjoy archeology.

91
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,820
From a boy who hated Easter
because he had to find eggs.

92
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,740
- Yeah, because you buried the eggs.
- That's beside the point.

93
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,740
- Yeah, because you buried the eggs.
- That's beside the point.

94
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,020
You're still here because of Kate.

95
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,860
Chris.

96
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,780
Look, son,

97
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,980
I love you,
but you're scorching my shirt.

98
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,380
Sorry.

99
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,500
You and Kate
are from different worlds.

100
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,500
You saw how that turned out
between your mother and me.

101
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,420
Yeah, but, Dad, no offense,
I'm not like you.

102
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,460
But Kate is.

103
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,420
Trust me, if it's between
archeology and you,

104
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,460
you'll lose.

105
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,500
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

106
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,100
I brought you a beer.

107
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,700
- That's so sweet.
- Half a beer anyways.

108
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,260
Half a beer.

109
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,780
- What you got going on here?
- The stairs.

110
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,700
The ones you were talking about?
Where do they go?

111
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,140
Now they don't go anywhere,
but they'll lead me to my tunnel

112
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,420
which will go
all the way to La Roque.

113
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,500
What do you say I help you out?
Show me what to do.

114
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,340
- I thought you hated this stuff.
- No, I don't hate it.

115
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,180
Let's have a beer, I need a break.

116
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,100
- You have the full one.
- That's sweet of you.

117
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,460
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

118
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,660
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

119
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,460
Think you'll follow
in your father's footsteps?

120
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,820
- No.
- No.

121
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,780
No way. Actually, I'm not really
all that interested in the past.

122
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,500
No? What are you interested in then?

123
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,220
I think I already know
the answer to that question.

124
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,860
I've been hoping that you'd notice.

125
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,580
I've been hoping you'd quit hoping
I'd notice.

126
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,180
So there's nothing there?

127
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,340
- Chris, you are the boss' son.
- So...

128
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,380
there is something there.

129
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,820
It's late, I'll just start on this tomorrow.
But thanks for the beer.

130
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,300
- Haven't been practicing, have you?
- I'm not getting any younger.

131
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,700
- You love this stuff.
- It's a habit I can't quite kick.

132
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,660
Let me take that from you before
you cut something you'll need later.

133
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,140
So talking about love.

134
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,940
- how did it go last night?
- It didn't.

135
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,140
So how does it feel being passed over
for 600-year-old ruins?

136
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,860
It sucks.

137
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,020
It sucks big time.

138
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,940
I don't understand you guys.
You live in the past.

139
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,300
You know what the past is to me?
The past is why my parents split up.

140
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,620
The past is what I've been force-fed
since I was little.

141
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,860
None of you archeologists
looks to the future.

142
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,340
What are you talking about? What is
the future but just more of the same?

143
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,060
More gadgets, more machines
like that thing you rode up on.

144
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,260
It's the past is where it's at,
you know.

145
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,220
People then,
they cared about each other.

146
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,340
- Men had honor, you know?
- No, no.

147
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,420
You know what that is to me?
Romantic warrior crap.

148
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,260
Romantic?

149
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,980
You want to see romantic?
Follow me.

150
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,500
Come on.

151
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,260
Come on!

152
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,180
What have you got?

153
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,740
Oh, another stone
sticking out of the ground.

154
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,420
No, it's a 600-year-old sarcophagus
with a French knight and his lady.

155
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,780
- Look, isn't she beautiful?
- She's a real knockout.

156
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,420
Very funny. Another thing,
down here, they're holding hands.

157
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,660
- Incredibly unusual for that period.
- That is kind of unusual, huh?

158
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,180
Oh, God, over here.
This knight has only got one ear.

159
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,700
What happened there?

160
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,260
What, one ear?
That piece is missing.

161
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,260
It's somewhere here in the dirt.

162
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm the archeologist.
It was carved that way.

163
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,980
- Fair enough.
- Trust me.

164
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,460
Who do you think they were?

165
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,340
Why would somebody that doesn't
give a shit be concerned with that?

166
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,340
- Because I'm intrigued, all right?
- See?

167
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,500
- What you wanted to hear?
- Yeah.

168
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,060
We're all intrigued by this.
That's why we're all here.

169
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,140
It's not just about the rocks
and the rubble.

170
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,740
It's about these people.

171
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,700
Who were they?
And what were their stories?

172
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,740
It helps us to understand where we
came from, or where we're going.

173
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,300
- You know what I like to say.
- "You make your own history."

174
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,740
- Do I say it that often?
- Yeah, all the time.

175
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,740
Well, whoever they were,

176
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,860
they made theirs

177
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,740
together.

178
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,540
It's best to go really, really slow.
It's better to be cautious.

179
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,820
Come on. Hurry up!

180
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,860
Cave-in at the monastery!
Cave-in at the monastery!

181
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,140
I was standing and the floor gave way
underneath my feet.

182
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,580
- How long has it been open?
- 15 minutes.

183
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,580
We have five minutes
before oxygen contamination.

184
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,300
- Let's move it.
- Be careful.

185
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,700
- It's under where I was working.
- I don't know about this.

186
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,020
Can everybody listen up?
Let's be careful, we got that?

187
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,460
I've got your back. Be safe.

188
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,740
- Who's going in first?
- OK, let's go.

189
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,700
- Who's going down first?
- I am.

190
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,980
- On belay! On Kate!
- OK, take me down nice and slow.

191
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,020
- Give me a radio check.
- Please be careful.

192
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,860
- OK, one-two. Do you read me?
- We're good.

193
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,260
That's good.
Just keep it steady.

194
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,420
- Lower Kate down.
- Lower me down.

195
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,940
Easy, guys.

196
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,300
Nice and slow.

197
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,300
Nice and slow.
I'm getting close to the first level.

198
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
- Easy!
- Bring me down, guys.

199
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,300
- A little more on Marek.
- Smell the stale air.

200
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,180
Kate, be careful down there.

201
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,460
I'm down. Oh, my God. This is
right below where I was working.

202
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,980
Are you all right?
What's going on?

203
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,940
"All right?" "All right" is not the word.

204
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,100
- One...
- Give me slack on the rope.

205
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,860
- More slack!
- Come on, guys.

206
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,940
- Oh, my God.
- This is unbelievable.

207
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,700
We are the first people in this room
for 600 years.

208
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,460
These...

209
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,380
These...

210
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,940
...are beautiful.

211
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,900
You won't believe the condition
of these...

212
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,220
- What have you got?
- Come here.

213
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,140
No way. This is too much.
Oh, my God.

214
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,820
- What is it?
- Oh, my God.

215
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,460
An old document box.

216
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,020
We've got an oilskin
with documents inside.

217
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,100
- Look at the condition of this thing!
- OK, let's be really careful.

218
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,700
Quick, get the bag.

219
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,940
- I can't believe this.
- That is gonna be such a find.

220
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,020
Careful, careful, careful.

221
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,620
Let's get this up.
I need the light for a minute.

222
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,420
Oh, my God.

223
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,380
Oh, my God.

224
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,700
- Oh, man!
- Give me the light.

225
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,660
- What kind of...
- It's amazing.

226
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,580
...son of a bitch would deliberately
damage something so beautiful?

227
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,340
Obviously not an archeologist.

228
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,180
We've gotta get out of here.
Let's go!

229
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,540
Guys, we're coming up!

230
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,060
Pull it up! Come on!

231
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,580
We want to go up quick, OK?

232
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,020
- Hold this.
- What are you doing, Marek?

233
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,620
- It's OK.
- What are you doing?

234
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,940
It's definitely a modern-day
bifocal lens.

235
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,980
I know. And bifocals weren't invented
until the mid-1 700s.

236
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,260
The hole only opened up
today, Stern.

237
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,700
There's been nobody down
that chamber before Kate and I.

238
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,420
If you think that's weird,
you'll love this.

239
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,740
- What is this?
- One of the documents you found.

240
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,260
It's just a simple list of the things
stored in there. Nothing special.

241
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,660
And then we found this. Look.

242
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,420
The professor?

243
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,060
"Help me"?
"E.A. Johnston"?

244
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,900
- "4/2/1357"?
- 1357.

245
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,260
- E.A. Johnston.
- What is going on?

246
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,940
I cross-matched the signatures.
It's definitely his handwriting.

247
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,660
But he's only been gone for two days.

248
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,620
Your father wrote that,
but he wrote it 600 years ago.

249
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,980
What's going on here?

250
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,940
François is looking for his spare pair.
I'll see if the prescriptions match.

251
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,060
So you're telling me this is the
professor's and it's 600 years old?

252
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,980
- What have you been smoking?
- Maybe you can explain.

253
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,140
If I knew, I'd explain it. All I know
is that the ink is 600 years old.

254
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,420
I know. This is my father.
This is him.

255
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,780
- He's just playing a prank.
- No! No, there is no way

256
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,620
he would risk contaminating the site
as a joke. He just wouldn't.

257
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,500
- Did you carbon-date the ink?
- Of course.

258
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,980
- There's got to be another reason.
- I did it three times.

259
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,380
Like I just said,

260
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,780
your father wrote that note,

261
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,460
but he wrote it 600 years ago.

262
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,340
I don't care about ITC's policies,
I'm his son. I wanna talk to him now.

263
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,860
I found the professor's glasses.
They were on his desk.

264
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,540
It's a perfect match, Look.

265
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,460
We should do an optical test
to make sure.

266
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,420
I'm sick of this. Either somebody
tell me where Professor Johnston is

267
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,980
or I report a kidnapping
to the authorities.

268
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,140
Have I made myself clear?

269
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,940
Just tell us when and where.

270
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,540
What is it?

271
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,220
Doniger's sending a plane for us.

272
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,540
We're going to New Mexico?

273
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,940
Let's pack up, guys.

274
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,340
Good morning.

275
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,300
Steven Kramer, ITC.
Frank Gordon, security.

276
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,900
- Where's my dad?
- You'll see your dad shortly.

277
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,740
- Where's Doniger at?
- Doniger's waiting inside.

278
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,500
- Mr. Kramer will explain everything.
- Tell me.

279
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,340
How come we have
a 600-year-old document

280
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,340
- with his handwriting?
- Pleading for help.

281
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,420
I'll explain as soon
as we get through security.

282
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,340
ITC is constantly advancing itself
in science.

283
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,140
30 years ago, the business world
was revolutionized with a machine

284
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,420
that sent documents anywhere
with the push of a button.

285
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,380
Doniger's vision was to do that
with 3-D objects.

286
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,340
- Like a fax or something?
- Exactly.

287
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,100
He's trying to send actual objects
from one place to another?

288
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,220
- Follow me.
- But that's impossible.

289
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,780
He would need a quantum computer
with millions of processors.

290
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,980
We used them to build a machine that
could fax three-dimensional objects.

291
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,980
I'll explain these mirrors later. It would
put FedEx and UPS out of business.

292
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,460
- You actually made it work?
- Yes.

293
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,820
Across a room.

294
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,860
But we wanted to send things
across continents

295
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,980
so we built a bigger machine.
This is the prototype.

296
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,460
The prototype?
So that thing that we just passed...

297
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,580
- Exactly.
- ...is the real thing?

298
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,980
We gave it a thousand times
more power.

299
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,580
We tried to send something
from New Mexico

300
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,660
to a twin machine at a lab
in New York City.

301
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,060
Now, here's the interesting part.

302
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,260
The package never arrived
at its destination.

303
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,300
A few hours later,
it showed up back here.

304
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,020
Wait a minute. So if it went missing
between New Mexico and New York,

305
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,860
- where did it go in the meantime?
- We asked the same question.

306
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,140
So we sent out a camera
over and over,

307
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,700
and we got back photos of the
same location, a hillside with trees.

308
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,140
That's when Mr. Doniger
made the brilliant decision

309
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,620
to point the camera straight up.

310
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,860
So once we cross-referenced
star charts to the horizon,

311
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,980
we realized that the camera
was not only in the wrong place,

312
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,980
- but it was in the wrong time.
- So, what does that mean?

313
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,740
The camera was taking photographs
of a wilderness

314
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,060
near Castlegard, France
in the year 1357.

315
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,460
So you're saying you accidentally
discovered time travel?

316
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,140
No, we accidentally discovered
a wormhole.

317
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,940
A wormhole that seems to be locked
to a single time and place in the past:

318
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,780
1357, Castlegard.

319
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,900
So you faxed my father's glasses and
documents back to the 1 4th century?

320
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,820
No, Chris.

321
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,180
Your father is in the 1 4th century.

322
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,540
What?

323
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,980
- We need you to help get him back.
- Mr. Robert Doniger,

324
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,460
this doesn't make sense.

325
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,860
A wormhole is a volatile force.
You can't send a person through one.

326
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,660
Can't fit a piece of paper
through a telephone wire.

327
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,020
But you can send a fax.

328
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,100
Sure, once you've broken the message
into a stream of electrons, but...

329
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,740
- Oh, shit.
- Now, look.

330
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,380
I don't care
about the hows or the whys.

331
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,340
I care about my father.
Did he know about all this?

332
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,180
I thought we could help each other.
We'd give him hints

333
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,500
I thought we could help each other.
We'd give him hints

334
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,580
about the best excavation areas,
and he could discover

335
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,740
why we're locked
into this particular place and time.

336
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,980
So this is why you've been
funding our dig.

337
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,180
He was more astute than I thought.
We gave him too many clues

338
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,060
and he became very, very suspicious.

339
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,020
How could you send him there?
God knows where he is...

340
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,780
Oh, he's a very persuasive man.
He insisted on going.

341
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,660
- Now he's stuck.
- That's where you all come in.

342
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,780
Do we look like
wormhole specialists?

343
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,780
You sent the professor
to the Hundred Years' War?

344
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,420
- Right.
- Turbulent times you sent him to.

345
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,980
We need cultural experts,
not scientists.

346
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,460
My people don't know
about the medieval world

347
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,180
or how to mingle,
which is what we have to do

348
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,300
if we are to find the professor
and bring him back.

349
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,980
So we bring him back,
it's that simple.

350
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,740
We step on that machine and whiz
back to 1357 to get him back?

351
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,780
Once he's broken us
into a stream of electrons.

352
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,060
- Why should we do what you ask us?
- I think we need to know more...

353
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,620
- I know you have a lot of questions...
- A lot of questions.

354
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,580
The professor's already been gone
for 72 hours

355
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,300
and every minute he's there,
it'll be more difficult to find him.

356
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,060
- That's true.
- Bob?

357
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,580
Excuse me, I need to get them
changed if they're going to go.

358
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,500
- Frank, change with them.
- I'm not going.

359
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,580
- Gomez and Baretto are ready.
- We need to think...

360
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,820
- I'd like you along.
- We didn't say we were going.

361
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,620
Steve, can you bring them
to prep, please.

362
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,900
Sure. Folks, this way.

363
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,260
Thank you. Please, this way.
Thank you.

364
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,420
Just follow Steve.
He'll take you to the prep room.

365
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,340
Bob, look. Gomez and Baretto
are my two best men.

366
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,740
They can handle any situation.
I would prefer not going.

367
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,660
I really want you to go.

368
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,020
And if you see Decker,
you know what to do.

369
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,660
Robert...

370
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,180
You know, that was a really
great speech you made.

371
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,140
I almost believed it myself.

372
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,420
- Didn't you forget something?
- What?

373
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,740
Come on. Look at Taub's MRIs.
Look at his arteries.

374
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,900
This was his tenth trip.
This is their first and only.

375
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,660
They deserve to know that we don't
know how he ended up in the desert.

376
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,100
You don't think they deserve
to know that?

377
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,740
I've told them enough.

378
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,940
How did my father get stuck
back there?

379
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,860
Doniger gave him an hour.

380
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,020
Things got harried,
and I lost him in the woods.

381
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,540
- You left him there.
- We have a limited time.

382
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,820
I had to come back
or we'd both be stuck.

383
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,460
I guess it's better him
than you, right?

384
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,220
Listen, there's a few things
we have to go over before we leave.

385
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,460
They need your vital data.
It's for your return process.

386
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,900
Change from your clothes
into those clothes over there.

387
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,100
Anything you want.
Put your personals in the lockers.

388
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,820
I want to introduce you to two friends.
Bill Baretto, Jimmy Gomez.

389
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,740
They're coming with us.
Buddies from the Marines.

390
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,700
- Why do we need Marines?
- Just in case something goes wrong.

391
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,380
I like to have all my bases covered.
All right, let's change up.

392
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,860
I can't believe you're considering this.
Do you understand what it does?

393
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,500
It strips you down
to a molecular level.

394
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,180
which means, for a moment,
you cease to exist.

395
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,660
- Listen to him, he's got a point.
- Hold on! Wait a second.

396
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,260
I don't need you, Miss Ericson.
Or Chris.

397
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,780
- I need you. You know the layout.
- Nobody knows it like I do.

398
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,060
- I go.
- There's no way I'm not going.

399
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,660
I just said I'm not going,
so don't touch me!

400
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,300
Thanks.

401
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,300
Stern, we don't need you back there.
You're a physicist.

402
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,900
- Your knowledge won't help us.
- I'm sorry.

403
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,540
But we are going to need you,
François.

404
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,620
- Why do we need him?
- Because he speaks French fluently.

405
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,020
- He's right.
- My high-school French sucks.

406
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,140
- Don't do this.
- We need his help.

407
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,380
- I'll cover you.
- Don't pressure him.

408
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,020
François, you have to make
your own decision on this.

409
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,540
Your father would've done it for me,
so, yes, I'll come.

410
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,740
- OK.
- Yes.

411
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,300
Thank you.

412
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,500
Thank you.

413
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,180
- Magnetic coils ready.
- Verifying now.

414
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,540
Platform up.

415
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,980
Computers are up, Mr. Doniger.

416
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,220
Tell Gordon we've got to get going.

417
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,460
Keep a couple of beers
cold for me, all right?

418
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,980
Mr. Stern.

419
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,340
Watch our backs, OK?

420
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,500
It will be all right.
We'll be back before you know it.

421
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,780
- Take it easy, bro.
- You know the 50 bucks I owe you?

422
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,580
All right, let's move it.

423
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,380
Frank, six hours
and the clock is running.

424
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,860
Wear these personal markers
around your neck.

425
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,900
You can use any one of them
to call for your return.

426
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,260
Frank will explain their intricacies
once you arrive.

427
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,140
Most importantly, one marker
will bring all of you back.

428
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,500
- Do not lose them.
- What about weapons?

429
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,100
Nothing modern goes back.
Especially weapons.

430
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,140
- They're set for a six-hour countdown.
- Countdown?

431
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,660
- They burn out after six hours.
- And then?

432
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,340
I'll get you back before you know it.

433
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,740
Oh.

434
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,300
Sorry, François,
they didn't have these back then.

435
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,660
I don't see without...

436
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,940
You'll be fine. That's where
we goofed with the professor.

437
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,620
I feel morally compelled to inform you
that there is a degree of pain.

438
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,140
I'm told it's rather intense,
but extremely fleeting.

439
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,700
A couple of seconds.
No residual discomfort.

440
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,500
So forgive me. I didn't want that
to influence your decision.

441
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,780
- OK. Good luck.
- Let's do it.

442
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,060
You all look great.
Miss Ericson, you look divine.

443
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,420
Good luck.

444
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,140
Don't worry about it.
You guys will be home for lunch.

445
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,260
- Think of it as the ultimate field trip.
- A fantastic thing for an archeologist.

446
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,180
- I can't believe we're doing this.
- Slowly. There are no railings.

447
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:06,980
Josh, come on down. Come watch.

448
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,660
Josh, come on down. Come watch.

449
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,740
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Take a place around the perimeter.

450
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,300
- Spread out.
- Move around the platform.

451
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,060
Take a deep breath, relax.
We'll be back before you know it.

452
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,220
- Are we set?
- All systems check.

453
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,460
Come in, Josh. Close the door.

454
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,740
- Good luck.
- Six hours and counting.

455
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,140
Mr. Marek? Mr. Marek.
I need you to take your position.

456
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,820
How's everybody doing?

457
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,220
- What the hell are we doing?
- Getting the chance of a lifetime.

458
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,300
Nothing to worry about.
We'll take care of you.

459
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,180
Just relax. Everything will be fine.

460
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,140
- DNA streams locked in.
- Thank you.

461
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,580
- OK, lock them in.
- Locking in.

462
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,140
- How long does it take?
- A couple of seconds.

463
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,540
Watch it here.

464
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,780
Mirrors locked.

465
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,820
Son of a...

466
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,020
Where is he? François!

467
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,420
- Are you all right?
- Where's François? François?

468
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,300
- There he is!
- François!

469
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,060
Pull him out!

470
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,340
Now we wait.

471
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,980
Give me your hand!

472
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,340
- Come on!
- François, hold on! Hold on!

473
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,420
Hold on!

474
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,620
- Here, take my hand.
- You all right?

475
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,740
You all right?
Everybody all right?

476
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,580
That was a close one.
All right.

477
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,420
Let's head up this hill.
Everybody follow me up.

478
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,340
- Hell of a start.
- We've always arrived on land.

479
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,660
- Gordon, is this it?
- I think so.

480
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,060
You think so?
Are we in 1357 France?

481
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,780
- This could be Oregon.
- Gordon, where are we?

482
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,940
Shut up!
Trust me, we're in 1357 France.

483
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,660
- Well, if this is France. I'm home.
- Come on, let's go.

484
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,540
Let me explain the markers. Press
here, it shows the remaining time.

485
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,580
Squeeze it, it takes you home.
But don't.

486
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,540
- Why?
- We haven't found his dad yet.

487
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,180
One last thing...

488
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,820
- He said, "Hide". Everyone hide.
- All right, take cover.

489
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,020
Let's go! Move! Now!

490
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,780
François, come on!

491
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,660
Well done, Sir De Kere.

492
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,220
- After him.
- Yes, my lord.

493
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,620
Get the others.
Find out who they are.

494
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,540
Come on, quick.

495
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,100
Oh, God! Baretto!

496
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,420
We got a field buck!
They're coming back!

497
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,460
- Oh, my God.
- Get a medic!

498
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,140
Get a medic up here!

499
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,060
- What was that? What was that?
- What?

500
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,660
What is that?

501
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,420
That's a grenade! Get down!

502
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,700
Oh, my God, he's left.

503
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,500
Get down! He'll see you!

504
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,660
You! Over here!

505
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,380
Let's go. Come on, come on!

506
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,940
All right, let's go.

507
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,820
Come on, Chris!

508
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,660
Kate!

509
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,620
Marek! Hey.

510
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,380
- Where's my boys? Where's Marek?
- The guys came after Baretto.

511
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,820
He took some arrows and then
he pressed his marker. He's gone.

512
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,900
He took two arrows,
and he must have hit his marker.

513
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,740
- Where's Gomez?
- I didn't see him.

514
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,220
Oh, my God.

515
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,860
Don't look.

516
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,940
- What are you doing?
- Oh, shit, I can't find his marker.

517
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,620
You're looking for his marker?
He's dead!

518
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,740
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting us out of here.

519
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,340
- We're not going anywhere.
- We can't save anyone if we're dead!

520
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,620
- Keep it quiet.
- You can't do that.

521
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,260
Why not?!

522
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,580
You need 40 feet of clearance
around all sides to work.

523
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,620
- What?
- I was trying to tell you.

524
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,700
Don't lose these. They're precious.

525
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,420
And if you follow my lead, I will
get your dad and get you home.

526
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,340
- François, it's going to be OK.
- Let's find Marek.

527
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,540
- What about Gomez?
- We can't do anything about him now.

528
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,580
- We gotta go. Look at me.
- François, come on.

529
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,700
Be quiet! The soldiers!

530
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,780
You passed us. You passed us
in the woods. It's OK. It's OK.

531
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,940
- We've lost the trail.
- Damn it.

532
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,060
- Pick it up again.
- Yes, Sir De Kere.

533
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,460
Search down by the river.

534
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,780
Jesus, you're a girl.

535
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,740
It's OK.

536
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,220
After the French bastards!

537
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,100
After them! Leave none living!

538
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,060
Careful.

539
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,180
- There you are.
- No.

540
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,700
Help! Help!

541
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,820
Shut it off!

542
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,780
He knew not to take
anything modern.

543
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,860
That son of a bitch brought
a grenade back with him.

544
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,620
I can't believe it.

545
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,140
The coils. The coils.

546
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,740
Damn it! He knew the regulations,
no modern weapons!

547
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,900
- Gomez?
- The lines are online!

548
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,700
- Well...
- His marker.

549
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,180
- What happened to the rest of them?
- Get a medic over here!

550
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,260
- I don't know.
- Give me your gloves.

551
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,740
Well, did anyone try
to come back with him?

552
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,700
I don't know. I know as much
as you, OK? Hang on.

553
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,980
What if they're trying
to come back now?

554
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,940
- It's not gonna happen...
- Don't jump to conclusions.

555
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,700
You can't leave seven people
stuck back there!

556
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,340
- Tell me you have a backup plan...
- Shut up!

557
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,300
I don't know. I don't know.

558
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,580
Please tell me you
have a backup plan.

559
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,620
Yes, we have a backup plan.

560
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,020
Go!

561
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,340
Gordon! Gordon! It's Marek! Chris!

562
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,740
This Frenchwoman
will lead us to Castlegard.

563
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,380
Great. That's great.
Let's go. Come on.

564
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:25,180
Wow. The village of Castlegard.
We're here.

565
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,060
Where is everyone going?

566
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,900
Hold on a second.

567
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,420
- What day is this?
- Marek...

568
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,780
It's the fourth of April.

569
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,420
- Of course it is. It's April 4th.
- 1357.

570
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,140
- The day La Roque falls?
- Wait, wait.

571
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,980
- What are you talking about?
- You son of a bitch,

572
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,980
- Excuse me?
- You brought us back

573
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,060
on the day the French attack.

574
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,420
By tonight, this whole place
is gonna be burned to the ground.

575
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,260
Stop with the history
and look for the professor.

576
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,860
Now, follow me.

577
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,820
Let's go.

578
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,380
I'm a physicist. Give me
something to do. I can help.

579
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,300
- Might as well be a pharmacist.
- Good one, Robert.

580
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,620
- Replacement panels are on their way.
- How long will this take?

581
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,020
Five hours and 27 minutes.

582
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,220
How do you know it's gonna
take 5 hours and 27 minutes?

583
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,020
Because that's all the time we have.

584
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,500
Once this platform is fixed,

585
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,820
even if the markers run out, we can
send someone back to get them?

586
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,140
The thing holding the wormhole open
is their markers.

587
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,020
But you've opened and closed
it dozens of times.

588
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,780
- Once the platform...
- Look, we don't even know

589
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,300
what we did to link us
to this wormhole.

590
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,420
A lucky calibration, chance impurity
in the coils. The point is, the grenade

591
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,220
probably destroyed any possibility
of re-creating it.

592
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:56,540
Once their markers expire,
they could be stuck there forever?

593
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,020
- Is that what you're saying?
- They could be.

594
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,780
Guys, come on. Come on, come on.

595
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,860
Come on. Come on.
Come on, this way.

596
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,660
Castle La Roque awaits its soldiers.

597
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,260
- The manor house.
- Look at that.

598
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,500
I can't believe it.
We were just working on it.

599
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,380
That's Castlegard, all right.

600
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,140
It's different.
That right section, I had wrong.

601
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,940
- Where did that tower come from?
- What if my Dad's in there?

602
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,940
- Yeah, you're right.
- How are we gonna get in?

603
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,420
Guys, soldiers coming.

604
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,020
- You there!
- Come on.

605
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,780
Why aren't you packing up?

606
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,540
- Run! Run!
- Halt! Stop!

607
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,580
- Go, go, go, go!
- Don't let them get away!

608
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,220
Get that horse out of the way!

609
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,060
My lord!

610
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,740
- Pick him up.
- Come on, my friend.

611
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,500
- Who are they?
- We captured them in the village.

612
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,980
I am Lord Oliver.
Who speaks for you?

613
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,860
- I do, my lord.
- You speak strangely.

614
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,180
Yes, we are Scottish, my lord.

615
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,980
Scottish? You've come
to kill us all in our beds?

616
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,820
First the old man
and now this group.

617
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,620
Why do the Scottish
find this village so pleasing?

618
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,940
- It must be your lord's kind manners.
- Indeed it must.

619
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,780
My lady.

620
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,460
- I beg your pardon, my lord.
- Let him speak.

621
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,940
- My lord, the old man you spoke of...
- Edward De Johnness?

622
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,820
He claims he's a magister.

623
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,140
- Do you know of him?
- He's our master, sir.

624
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,660
- All is well with him?
- He said he was alone.

625
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,740
We were several days behind him.
He does not know we are here.

626
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,500
Who are you?

627
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,580
Yes, you. The one whose head
is touching the ceiling.

628
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,700
François, my lord.

629
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,580
A Frenchman.

630
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,940
Hold. Please. Please.
We're all gentlemen here.

631
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,580
He's our interpreter, sir.

632
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,780
Forgive them. I'm at war with the
French, as well as the Scottish.

633
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,420
Have I forgotten anyone?
The Spaniards, am I at war with them?

634
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,140
Arnaut has sent many spies
into my midst.

635
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,380
- No, he's not a spy.
- No?

636
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,180
- He's our friend.
- I'm sure he is.

637
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,540
He's too tall to be a spy, anyway.

638
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,100
- Interpret.
- Be quiet.

639
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,060
Interpret.

640
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,820
- I'm a spy.
- I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.

641
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,700
- It means...
- Be quiet, François.

642
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,540
...I am a spy.

643
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,260
My God, it's a miracle.
A quiet Frenchman.

644
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,020
- Did you hear that?
- No.

645
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,500
Louder, boy! Come on!

646
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,060
I am a spy.

647
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,540
I thought so.

648
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,260
- Oh, my God!
- Get rid of the Frenchman.

649
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,660
Put them with the old man.
We may need them.

650
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,540
Who's next?

651
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,660
- No!
- No, Chris!

652
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,060
Don't! Don't!

653
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,540
Oh. François. François.

654
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,820
Inside!

655
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,140
- Up! Move it! Move it!
- No! Don't push me!

656
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,180
- Hey, leave her alone!
- Move it, ease on!

657
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,980
- All right, you bloody Scottish!
- Hold on!

658
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,060
I'm moving!

659
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,940
Over here, Andre.
This way. Come on.

660
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,140
My marker. Guys, I lost my marker!

661
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,140
Don't worry, we only need one marker
to get home, OK?

662
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,860
- This can't be happening.
- Careful with the rest.

663
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,300
Those bastards killed François.

664
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,020
Professor.

665
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,140
Professor!

666
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,220
- Kate?
- Yeah.

667
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:52,340
- Kate. Oh, my God, Kate.
- Are you all right?

668
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,180
Oh, my God. You got my message.

669
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,500
Chris, your dad.

670
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,140
- Chris is here and Marek's here.
- Dad?

671
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,620
- Son.
- Dad.

672
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,460
- Chris, my son.
- Glad you're still alive.

673
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,900
Oh, God.

674
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,700
What happened?

675
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,020
- You've lost such blood.
- It's not my blood.

676
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,900
It's François'.

677
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,940
He's dead.

678
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,420
Oliver had him killed
because he's French.

679
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:27,180
This guy had a sword
and he just ran him through.

680
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,620
Professor, what happened?

681
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,420
I was trying to avoid the English,
but they found me in the monastery.

682
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,540
I convinced Oliver I was a magister
on my way to Dublin.

683
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,940
I skipped Shakespeare.
What is a magister?

684
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,100
- It's a scientist.
- He accused me of being a spy.

685
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,580
- How did you survive that?
- I promised Oliver a new weapon.

686
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,940
What kind of weapon?

687
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:57,180
A liquid fire so intense
that even water couldn't harm it.

688
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,340
Greek fire?
You promised him Greek fire?

689
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,900
Professor. I'm sorry, have you
considered what you may have done?

690
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,180
You've given the English
a serious advantage in this battle.

691
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,500
- They're supposed to lose the war!
- I was alone!

692
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,500
- Marek. Marek!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

693
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,380
The point is,
when these guys come here,

694
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,700
and take us up to La Roque.
when they seal that place off for battle,

695
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,140
there is no escape.
We're as good as dead.

696
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,260
- No, we gotta get out of here now.
- Wait, wait, wait.

697
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,860
Remember that field
where the peasant huts were?

698
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,140
That's the closest place
with enough room to use the marker.

699
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,780
- How do we get there?
- We have to do it fast.

700
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,140
- We've got four hours.
- Four hours is plenty.

701
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,620
The way I see it, we've got 650 years
of knowledge on these guys.

702
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,660
There's no reason why we shouldn't
be able to get home in 20 minutes.

703
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,420
- OK, let's find a way out.
- Let's look around.

704
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,460
There's a hole here
big enough to climb through.

705
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,300
- Quiet!
- OK, all right.

706
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,380
She was with the group
we caught earlier, my lord.

707
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,900
May I ask why
you're trespassing on my land?

708
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,220
Come, come.

709
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,420
- What are you doing?
- Here's what I'll do:

710
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,900
I'm gonna scale down the wall. When
it's clear, I'm gonna let you guys out.

711
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,460
- All right.
- You're not going anywhere.

712
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,340
What? I am, I'm...

713
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,700
Marek, I'm the best climber,
I am the best climber.

714
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,020
If anyone should
be going, it should be me,

715
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,180
but those roof slats won't
hold me, or you, or you, Chris.

716
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,660
- No, no...
- Wait. Wait.

717
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,100
But they might hold you, Kate.

718
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,660
Now, Kate, this isn't a game.
Are you prepared to take a life?

719
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,860
I'll do what I have to do.

720
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,340
There's no way.
You're not going anywhere.

721
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,460
It's going to be all right, OK?

722
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,260
There's one thing worse than
dying here, and that's living here.

723
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,980
I refuse to do either.
I'm going. It's OK.

724
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,540
She's right.

725
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,380
Kate.

726
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:38,100
- Please, please take care.
- Hey, it's easy. It's gonna be easy.

727
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,460
Chris, I need your help. Come on.

728
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,300
I need you to hold that back
and keep it open.

729
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,340
All right?

730
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,900
- Kate, be careful.
- OK, here I go.

731
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,660
- Easy.
- There's guards there.

732
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,100
I'm gonna go up and over.

733
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,980
- There's a window on the side.
- OK, watch yourself.

734
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,220
I got you! I got you! Hold on!

735
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,820
Hold on. I got you. Don't let go.

736
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,540
- Are you OK?
- I've got a foothold.

737
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,460
- We're gonna pull you back in.
- No, I'm good.

738
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,100
- OK, please be careful.
- I've got to keep going.

739
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,780
You, man! Gather those children
and move!

740
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,780
All clear on the outside.

741
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,340
Hold your line, men! In position!

742
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,500
Too much ale.
We'll play again when I get back.

743
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,340
Keep them quiet.

744
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,220
- What the...?
- Now!

745
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,740
Grab a weapon!

746
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,020
- Let's go, Chris!
- Very sorry.

747
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,020
We're heading out the way
we came in, all right? Marek?

748
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,020
- Marek!
- Yeah, yeah. You go ahead.

749
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,740
- I'll take the rear.
- All right, let's go!

750
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,180
Kate, we gotta go.

751
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,180
Oh, be careful!

752
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,380
Let's go! Come on. Let's go!

753
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,420
Quiet.

754
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,380
You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up with you.

755
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,220
- What are you doing?
- Listen.

756
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,820
- Are you crazy?
- Let's go.

757
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,860
- I got my marker, I'll catch up.
- Come on.

758
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,420
- Where is he?
- He'll catch up. He's got his marker.

759
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,860
- Robert!
- Yeah?

760
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,420
DNA streaming should
be online...now.

761
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,260
- Got it!
- Fully functioning?

762
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,220
- Yeah!
- It's a start.

763
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,660
- Don't move. Don't say a word.
- Traitor!

764
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:16,060
Jesus. Why didn't you listen to me?

765
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,900
Shit!

766
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,580
For God's... Jesus!
Scotsman! Stop, it's me!

767
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,300
Stop!

768
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,500
What? What are you saying?

769
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,700
Ax! Give me the ax!

770
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,100
And help me watch for the wall!

771
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,540
Move that stuff!
Put it against the door!

772
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,140
- Help me!
- Get out of the way, woman!

773
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,060
Get out of the way!

774
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,580
Please! Come on!
There we go!

775
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,820
Go!

776
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,860
Guards!

777
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:41,140
- Who is that guy?
- His name is De Kere.

778
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,900
Come on. Quick,
let's head back to the river.

779
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,660
Get more guards!

780
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,020
- We're not going without Marek.
- I don't give a shit about Marek.

781
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:55,140
My job was to get the professor.
I can't take care of you.

782
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:59,180
I lost Gomez, Baretto. You guys are
on your own. Or follow me. Let's go!

783
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,020
To the river, quick.

784
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,940
We have a field buck.
Somebody's trying to come back.

785
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,220
- How strong?
- It's minimal.

786
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,820
- What does that mean?
- It means they're still alive.

787
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,780
Halt!

788
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,500
Come on. Come on.

789
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,660
Where is he? Where's Gordon?

790
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,300
Where's...?

791
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,780
- There he is. There he is.
- I saw him. Come on!

792
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,060
- Wait. Watch it.
- Chris! Drop your weapon.

793
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,220
OK. Go.

794
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,140
Oh, shit.

795
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,940
- Come on!
- Gonna leave us like you left my dad?

796
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,740
- People are looking.
- There's no time.

797
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,580
- Listen. Listen.
- Everybody is looking.

798
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,740
- Be quiet.
- Kate, hit your marker.

799
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,140
Press yours.
I'm not going without Marek.

800
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,660
- Hit your marker.
- You're not going anywhere.

801
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,700
Marek's got his own marker.

802
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,740
Search every building
and every farm!

803
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,620
- Oh, shit.
- Kate, press it.

804
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,100
We can come back for Marek.
Press it. We've been here too long.

805
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,820
- Press it.
- It's not working.

806
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:31,660
- It's not working.
- I know how to do this.

807
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,500
- Why isn't it?
- I don't know.

808
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:38,100
- If it were working, we'd be home now!
- Everybody, walk away slowly.

809
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,900
Let's find a place to hide.

810
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,260
Infantry, spread out. Search the huts!

811
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:54,980
Search everywhere and capture them!

812
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:18,220
Oh, by the way,
my name's Andre Marek.

813
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,100
Castlegard was your village, wasn't it?

814
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:30,540
- Don't worry, you'll return there soon.
- No.

815
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:34,500
The English will burn it to the ground
before they move to La Roque.

816
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,100
- No, La Roque will fall too.
- Yes.

817
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,580
But it will take many more lives

818
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,940
and many months of fighting
before it happens.

819
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:48,100
The French built that fortress.
We know how strong it is.

820
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,980
La Roque will fall tonight.

821
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:03,540
Only a prophet...or a fool
could make such a claim.

822
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,940
In your case, it's probably the fool.

823
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,500
Whichever makes you smile like that.

824
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:25,780
Are you...married?

825
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,820
No.

826
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:31,860
We've been fighting the English
since before I was born.

827
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,620
There's no time for marriage.

828
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,100
Of course.

829
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:42,340
Are you with...anyone?

830
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,980
- Am I with anyone?
- Yeah.

831
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,100
I'm with you.

832
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:52,540
I know. I know.
What I mean is, is there someone...?

833
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,220
Is there someone that you see?

834
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,820
- Do I see?
- Yeah.

835
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,980
Nobody. It is possible
they are hiding on the shore

836
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,340
or in the woods.
They could be anywhere.

837
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,940
Oh, God. You know, it's funny,

838
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,700
but we're speaking
the same language,

839
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,140
but you don't understand
anything I'm saying, do you?

840
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,180
Get them!

841
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,380
No, no.

842
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,660
It is good. They are French.
They will help us.

843
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,260
- You're Lady Claire.
- Lady?

844
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,460
I like that. It's charming.

845
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,020
Dame Claire.

846
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,940
Fire!

847
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,100
Fire!

848
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,780
Find them!

849
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,260
I killed that man.

850
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,380
I've gotta live with that.

851
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:16,060
- In here!
- We found them!

852
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:20,060
- We found them, my lord!
- Over here now!

853
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,060
- Come on!
- Don't let them go!

854
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,020
Come on!

855
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,660
Go inside!

856
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,820
Go around the back.

857
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,700
- Shut up and move over there.
- Come on.

858
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,220
- Burn it.
- No.

859
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:47,020
- No, you can't do that!
- Don't.

860
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:50,380
Chris, please get out of there.
Chris!

861
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:55,100
Chris! My son's in there!
Chris, get out of there!

862
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,540
Hold your man.

863
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,460
No! No!

864
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:11,740
All right, come on.

865
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,380
- Come on.
- Chris, wait up.

866
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:28,860
- Come on.
- Wait up.

867
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,140
- Claire!
- Arnaut.

868
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:36,340
He is very grateful
you returned his sister...

869
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,620
- You're English.
- No, I'm Scottish.

870
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,940
Arnaut, he saved the life
of one of your men.

871
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,980
- You're Scottish, huh?
- Yes.

872
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:48,540
In that case, I do not know how
to express my gratitude.

873
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:52,540
Well, you can. Just keep
her close and keep her safe.

874
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,060
- I can take care of myself.
- Yes, that's obvious.

875
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:00,220
Please, do not let her out
of your sight, especially tonight.

876
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,340
Do not worry, she will be
well protected.

877
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:07,380
I must leave. I must return
to Castlegard to search for my friends.

878
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:10,300
I need to ask you perhaps
for a horse and a weapon.

879
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,220
You will not make it alive
through the English lines.

880
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,660
They are moving from the village
to La Roque. We attack tonight.

881
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,060
- You must not go back there.
- I must try and find my friends.

882
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:23,220
I'm sorry.

883
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:26,980
Very well. I will give you
what you ask for.

884
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,020
- Thank you again.
- Thank you.

885
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:37,220
- Lady Claire...
- Claire.

886
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,140
I wish we had met at another time.

887
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,020
Andre Marek.

888
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,380
Are you married?

889
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,700
No.

890
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,260
Arnaut?

891
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:42,260
Arnaut has dismounted,
and he's with his sister.

892
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:47,380
Well done.
In fast, kill Arnaut and out.

893
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,900
And may God be with you.

894
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:07,700
All right. I have to get inside
La Roque and find my dad.

895
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,420
- You'll never make it through.
- I'll find a way.

896
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:13,060
There is no way. You'll get killed.

897
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:16,620
Oh, Jesus. Go, go.

898
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,820
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do.

899
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:32,220
There's another way.

900
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,780
- What, the tunnel?
- Yeah.

901
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,260
You never found it.
You don't know it exists.

902
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:40,380
- There's always been a rumor.
- Yeah, but that's a rumor.

903
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:43,980
- My dad's life is on the line.
- All of our lives are on the line.

904
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:47,740
Look, if that tunnel ever existed,
it's going to exist now, 1357.

905
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,060
I know it's in that monastery. I know it.

906
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,940
I wanna save your father
as much as you do.

907
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:57,820
You have to trust me,
I know it's there.

908
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,900
I know it.

909
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,420
You've got to trust me.

910
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,820
Stay in line.

911
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:29,700
- Move along.
- Keep the pace!

912
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,580
Kill Arnaut!

913
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,340
Claire!

914
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,980
Claire! Claire!

915
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:09,460
Move along!

916
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,900
Come on, lads.

917
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,620
That's Marek! Marek!

918
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,260
- Marek!
- I'm OK.

919
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:39,420
It's Chris and Kate, Marek.

920
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:43,500
- What about Chris and Kate?
- They didn't make it.

921
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,940
- They've killed them.
- What?

922
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,460
Been a while, hasn't it, Frank?

923
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,900
Oh, my God.

924
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:01,740
I thought you were dead.

925
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,900
Right, that's why you sent Taub
to assassinate me.

926
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,700
Not to assassinate you,
to bring you home.

927
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:11,340
- Right, just like you are.
- No, look... Listen.

928
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:15,140
- Listen to me, Will. I need your help.
- What's this?

929
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,100
Look, it's not working anyway.

930
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,260
It says here you got less
than one and a half hours left.

931
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,580
- It doesn't work.
- Bullshit.

932
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:25,660
Look, you've got to believe me,
it wasn't my fault, OK?

933
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,300
- I've got a family.
- Yeah?

934
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,660
- You've met my family.
- You got a family?

935
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,900
- You have a family.
- I've got a family.

936
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,220
- So did I!
- No!

937
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:39,420
- No!
- No! No!

938
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:42,820
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

939
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:52,180
Last time I saw him, he was running
with his marker for an open space.

940
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:56,020
I was on the ground,
three arrows in me.

941
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:02,700
I used to be William Decker.
ITC employee number 273.

942
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,220
Now...

943
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:08,140
...I'm Sir William De Kere.
Lord Oliver's aide-de-camp.

944
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:12,860
You looked pretty impressive today,
Marek, for an academic.

945
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:16,700
- How do you know my name?
- I know all of your names.

946
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:20,980
We read every report out of your dig
before we made the first trip back.

947
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,180
How many times have you been here?

948
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:26,780
Enough to know
transcription errors intimately.

949
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:29,260
Transcription errors?

950
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:35,100
Doniger, that son of a bitch.
He hasn't told you a thing, has he?

951
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,220
What are transcription errors?

952
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:41,380
Mistakes in the DNA
reconstruction process.

953
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:45,260
- It's like faxing a fax.
- Distortions. Mistakes.

954
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,260
Only the distortions
aren't in the letters.

955
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:52,220
It's body parts. The organs.

956
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:56,300
I've gone in too many times.
I'll never survive another trip.

957
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,900
All that damage,
it can be repaired, but not here.

958
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,940
And not in this time.
You'd have to go back.

959
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:08,460
Why don't you press the marker?
We can all go home, Decker, huh?

960
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,900
My name is De Kere.
This is my home.

961
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,260
Lord Oliver awaits his Greek fire.

962
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,980
After that, your survival depends
on your knowledge of history.

963
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:24,660
How good you make me look.
I rise in favor, so do you.

964
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:25,700
I fall, you fall.

965
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:28,340
I fall, you fall.

966
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,420
Marek, where's your marker?

967
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,700
De Kere, Decker, whatever
his name is, he took it off me.

968
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:36,980
Oh, God.

969
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:48,180
We're friends of
Edward De Johnness.

970
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:51,780
- Edward De Johnness.
- The magister.

971
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,180
He's my father.

972
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:01,700
- The Englishmen have harmed him?
- We don't know.

973
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,380
- We were gonna ask for your help.
- Yeah, we need your help.

974
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:07,860
Come.

975
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:16,180
We need to hurry.
We don't have much time.

976
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,740
Lord Oliver demands
a demonstration before nightfall.

977
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,300
It would be best
not to miss the deadline.

978
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,940
They've done it. The stuff's all there.

979
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:15,940
This stuff's a bit coarse, but it's good.

980
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:19,580
What am I talking about?
I can't do this.

981
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:23,300
I can't give them Greek fire
and influence the course of history.

982
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:26,660
- I may already have done that.
- What do you mean?

983
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,740
When we first arrived here,
we were helped by this girl

984
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,420
who took us up to Castlegard.

985
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,420
In fact, that's who I went back
to get when we escaped.

986
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:38,220
That girl turned out to be
Lady Claire, Arnaut's sister.

987
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:40,820
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

988
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:43,580
I've delivered her to the French
for safekeeping.

989
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:47,420
She's incredibly important.
Her death rallies the French to win.

990
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,060
- Don't you understand?
- Keep it down, OK?

991
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:53,860
Now we have to be on Oliver's side
just to stay alive.

992
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,860
This is exactly where I was digging.

993
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:02,580
This is it. This is the place where...
We're here. We're...

994
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,340
What do you mean?

995
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,420
This is the chamber
where I was working.

996
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:11,220
- I'm sorry, what did he say?
- The army of Arnaut is ready to attack.

997
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:15,020
- We're running out of time.
- Those are the stairs. It's under here.

998
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:25,060
Move them up here.

999
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:40,900
There's a goodly number
of trebuchets, my lord.

1000
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,060
What's a little fire
to these stone walls?

1001
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:08,660
- There's nothing down here.
- This is it.

1002
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:12,380
This is the chamber.
This is where the hole was.

1003
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,900
- We came down here...
- There's nothing here.

1004
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,100
Marek would've been working there.
The box would've been...

1005
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:22,060
Oh, my God. That is the box.

1006
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:25,020
That's the parchment he wrote on.

1007
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:33,140
My father's glasses.

1008
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:37,300
- Yeah, we've got to go.
- No, no, put it back.

1009
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:41,300
If we don't find this, in the future
we're never gonna find your father.

1010
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,700
Put it back.

1011
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,820
We still gotta go.
We gotta get up to La Roque.

1012
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:49,460
No, the stone relief was damaged.
Somebody had damaged it.

1013
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:53,620
"What kind of son of a bitch
would damage something so..."

1014
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,780
It was me.

1015
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:02,140
It was me.

1016
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,820
I was the son of a...

1017
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,140
What is she doing?

1018
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,940
Wait! Get back! Stay back!

1019
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:21,100
Watch out. Watch out.

1020
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:36,660
Oh, wow. It's the tunnel.

1021
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,580
It's the tunnel!

1022
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,780
Give me a torch.

1023
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,860
Hey, give me that one,
Kate, watch out. Let me go in.

1024
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:53,500
- Get Arnaut?
- Yes, get Arnaut. Go.

1025
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:57,100
- Please, hurry, Hurry.
- Kate, get in here.

1026
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,100
- Oh, whoa.
- You got it?

1027
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:00,380
Yeah, I do.

1028
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:05,060
Careful, boys, this is Greek fire.
You can blow us all to hell here.

1029
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:09,020
Smooth and easy, now.
No spills.

1030
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,260
That's good.

1031
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,540
- Trebuchet!
- Trebuchet!

1032
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:03,500
- Trebuchet!
- Trebuchet!

1033
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,900
Shit.

1034
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,700
- You OK?
- Yeah. Hurry, there's no time.

1035
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:28,140
- Trebuchet!
- Trebuchet! Trebuchet!

1036
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,980
Bring water!

1037
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:37,700
Lord Oliver, the magister
with your demonstration.

1038
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,580
Oh, yes, I'll see it now.

1039
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:42,340
- Understand, my lord, I've never...
- Show me now!

1040
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:45,580
- Show him!
- Your fire of the Greeks.

1041
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:56,940
- Marek, fire it!
- OK, come on, let's move it.

1042
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,580
Trebuchet!

1043
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,500
Just fire the damn thing!

1044
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,780
I cannot fire it.

1045
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,660
Fire it!

1046
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:12,980
- Fire!
- Ready, fire!

1047
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:28,220
Out of the way. Move.
Let me pass.

1048
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,820
That's it?

1049
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,340
So you betrayed me.
You promised me Greek fire.

1050
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,260
I should have had you hung...

1051
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:44,260
- What?
- With your permission, my lord.

1052
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,420
The more water, the more fire.

1053
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,660
Good.

1054
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,460
Better.

1055
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,900
My God, you are a magician,
not a magister.

1056
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:09,420
I want this for every cannon.
How many men will you need?

1057
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:10,780
- Twenty.
- Twenty.

1058
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,220
- Give this man 20 men.
- As you wish.

1059
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:16,020
This way, magician.

1060
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:09,420
Archers to the battlements!

1061
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:14,500
- Archers to the battlements!
- Archers to the battlements!

1062
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:19,220
- We have 81%.
- No, no. It's over.

1063
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:21,700
I'm not gonna play with their lives
like this.

1064
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:25,380
We can't get 100% efficiency
from patched-together coils.

1065
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,300
What's the safest minimum percent?

1066
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:31,060
- We've done successful tests at 80%.
- You just said we have 81%.

1067
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,940
- They were inanimate objects.
- With reflectors up.

1068
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,020
- How much time do we have?
- 28 minutes.

1069
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:37,380
No room for error.

1070
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:39,300
- They could be deformed.
- Can we?

1071
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,140
- Yes, we can.
- It's too risky.

1072
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,260
You think I'm gonna let you
leave them?

1073
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,420
- Think I want to?
- I don't think you care.

1074
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,500
They have a chance,
some kind of life.

1075
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:50,620
No, you lost the chance for that
decision a long time ago.

1076
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:55,100
- This is no longer your decision.
- You know what? It is and I have.

1077
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,140
I'm sorry.

1078
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,860
- Fire the moat.
- Yes, my lord.

1079
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:04,100
Fire the moat!

1080
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:27,300
- Light your arrows.
- Light arrows.

1081
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:37,260
- Archers, prepare.
- Archers, prepare.

1082
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,460
- Stretch.
- Stretch.

1083
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:49,660
Away!

1084
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,980
- Night arrows.
- Night arrows.

1085
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:26,980
A little surprise for the French.

1086
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:29,380
- Ready!
- Stretch.

1087
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:30,900
Away!

1088
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:03,900
We're close now.
We're close. I know it.

1089
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:05,660
Great.

1090
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,620
Well done, my lord.

1091
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,340
Trebuchet!

1092
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:05,820
One more of them,
and we become history.

1093
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,540
Oh, no.

1094
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,540
No.

1095
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:23,660
We're going.
Forward, right maybe.

1096
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:25,540
Maybe it's just...

1097
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:28,140
Or we could go up, right?
We could go up.

1098
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:31,380
- Kate...
- No, don't. No! No!

1099
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,380
- Kate.
- No.

1100
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:36,020
Kate.

1101
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:40,100
Maybe we missed something.
Maybe we made a wrong turn.

1102
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:42,580
- We could...
- It's too late.

1103
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,780
It's just too late.

1104
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:52,700
I said trust me,
and I've let you down.

1105
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:56,180
And I've let your father down. And...

1106
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:00,260
- I've let everybody down.
- No.

1107
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:03,740
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
- No, you didn't.

1108
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:05,940
Kate, come here.

1109
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:07,620
Kate, come here.

1110
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:10,700
Come here. Come here.

1111
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:26,780
- Close the inner gates!
- Close the inner gates!

1112
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:32,220
- This is growing tiresome.
- The courtyard is secure, my lord.

1113
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:35,260
Good, but this Frenchman
needs to be put in his place.

1114
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:37,540
- It's time.
- Captain!

1115
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,420
It is time!

1116
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,100
Robert.

1117
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:57,380
Thirteen minutes left.
Let's try and get them back.

1118
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:00,060
Are we gonna go over all this again?

1119
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,260
What are you doing?

1120
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:07,420
What the hell do you think I'm doing?
I'm protecting our interests.

1121
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:11,100
- What's happened to you?
- How many lives are lost

1122
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:12,900
on the cutting edge
of discovery?

1123
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:16,700
- It's the price for great advances.
- These were kids, not astronauts!

1124
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,300
- I know!
- They had no idea!

1125
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,340
Even worse when they're deformed!
You know the media.

1126
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:24,340
They'll twist it around
and label it a "death machine".

1127
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:27,100
- It has a serious flaw!
- And you'll fix it.

1128
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,980
- No, I won't.
- Like you fixed everything else.

1129
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,780
- No.
- What?

1130
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:35,140
- You won't?
- No, I won't.

1131
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:38,460
I can't believe you'd just throw away
your place in history.

1132
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:42,340
- I already have, we're cycling up.
- Think you can go behind my back?

1133
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:46,300
Huh? Kramer!

1134
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:50,900
Kramer?

1135
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:03,820
- Make the prisoner ready.
- What is your will, my lord?

1136
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:06,260
- Back to work.
- Secure her to the battlements.

1137
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:08,740
I want to be sure
the French can see her.

1138
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:10,620
At once, my lord.

1139
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:15,180
- I'll give your brother a choice.
- Oh, shit.

1140
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,820
- You are to be tied to the battlements.
- What?

1141
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:21,260
Either he lays down his arms

1142
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:25,060
or he kills you
with his own weapons.

1143
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:30,820
Let us hope a man who stoops
to using his own sister as a spy

1144
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:33,340
still has some sense of decency left.

1145
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,740
God be with you, lady.

1146
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:48,460
It's her.

1147
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:51,100
It's Lady Claire.

1148
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,740
I delivered her
to Arnaut for safekeeping.

1149
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:56,420
- How did the English get her?
- It's history.

1150
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,700
Then history will change.

1151
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:11,900
Oliver.

1152
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,980
Release Lady Claire
and bring her down to me now,

1153
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:20,580
or by God.
I will destroy your arsenal.

1154
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:23,340
- Marek! No!
- Get the hell out of here. Go now!

1155
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,100
Halt!

1156
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:29,660
For God's sake.
If that thing blows, it'll kill us all.

1157
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:32,660
- Bring her down.
- No! Do not touch her!

1158
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:38,500
My lord, if he drops the torch,
he then kills her too. He will not do it.

1159
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:41,460
Back off, De Kere.
Or Decker, or whatever your name is.

1160
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:45,060
I will blow your arsenal to hell!

1161
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:55,060
- There's no way out.
- You're English.

1162
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:58,220
- No. No, no, we're not.
- You're English! This is a trap!

1163
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:02,020
- Run, my lord!
- Marek!

1164
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,940
- You are working for Oliver.
- No, we're not.

1165
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:07,780
I will kill both of you!

1166
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,100
Down!

1167
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,700
- Yeah!
- Yahoo!

1168
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:27,020
Be careful, my lord.

1169
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:30,740
Archers, to the battlements!

1170
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:33,980
Here.

1171
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,820
- Hold the line on the east tower.
- Oliver!

1172
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:46,900
Kill her! Now!

1173
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,540
- Arnaut!
- Claire!

1174
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,340
We've got to find the others.

1175
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:15,580
Don't!

1176
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:21,740
Hold your line!

1177
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:31,620
- Dad.
- Chris, you're alive! Kate, thank God!

1178
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,820
- Where's Marek?
- I don't know.

1179
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:02,140
There goes Marek.
There's Marek.

1180
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:14,300
It's OK. It's OK, Claire.

1181
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:20,140
It's me. It's me.
It's me. It's me. It's me.

1182
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:23,700
- What are you doing?
- Open the gate.

1183
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:25,700
Chris, stop!

1184
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:37,980
- It's solid.
- Let me get up. I've gotta get up.

1185
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:39,660
- Can you?
- Yeah.

1186
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:11,260
This is for France.

1187
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:52,620
- We gotta get out of here.
- Where's Marek?

1188
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:55,740
- I don't know.
- He went after Lady Claire. There.

1189
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:01,500
No!

1190
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:06,980
My ear! My ear!

1191
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:13,940
It's me.

1192
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,580
It's me.

1193
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:27,260
- It's not working.
- Well, it's broken.

1194
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:44,780
- OK.
- I gotta get Marek.

1195
01:37:44,980 --> 01:37:46,460
De Kere took his.

1196
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,860
- You guys run to the field.
- Not without you.

1197
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:54,220
Kate! Run to the center of the field and
wait for us. I'll get the other marker.

1198
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:56,380
- Dad, go with her. Go!
- Be careful.

1199
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:02,340
Over here.

1200
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:04,980
Marek!

1201
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:10,900
Chris, I thought you were dead.

1202
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:12,860
Your marker! Let's go!

1203
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:16,660
De Kere!
De Kere has yours.

1204
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,460
Stern!

1205
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:25,180
Open this door.

1206
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:28,300
Where's Kramer?

1207
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,540
Where's Kramer?

1208
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:36,460
Shit!

1209
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:41,900
Take me home. Please.

1210
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:48,620
Go!

1211
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:57,380
- It's working. Be careful.
- Come on, let's go.

1212
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:59,500
- Marek, come on.
- Get out of here!

1213
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:02,820
We got less than a minute!
Let's go home, come on!

1214
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:05,420
Come on, let's go!

1215
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:08,220
Let's go, man!
Come on, they're waiting!

1216
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:11,140
- Go. Get the hell out of here.
- No, let's go home!

1217
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:16,300
I am home, Chris.

1218
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,100
Chris, just go.

1219
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,940
Say goodbye for me.

1220
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:28,740
I'm gonna miss you, Marek.

1221
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:46,340
If you can do it, then do it.
One more minute. Eighty-one percent, OK?

1222
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:49,580
- What's he doing?
- The coils.

1223
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:54,220
- Come on!
- This is good here.

1224
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:03,900
- Wait!
- There he is.

1225
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:06,540
- Wait!
- Come on! Where's Marek?

1226
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:08,860
- He's staying. He's staying.
- Let's go.

1227
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:11,460
- Push the marker.
- I am.

1228
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:14,340
I'm getting a field buck!
Someone's coming back!

1229
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:16,460
What? No!

1230
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:19,220
- No!
- You gotta...

1231
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,780
I don't have a marker.

1232
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:28,780
I'll never get home.

1233
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:36,980
Where's Marek?

1234
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:40,980
And François?

1235
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:52,380
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

1236
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:56,700
Hey, Kate just called
from the monastery dig.

1237
01:41:56,900 --> 01:42:00,020
She finished excavating
the sarcophagus and wants us there.

1238
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:01,860
- Wanna drive?
- Yeah, I'll drive.

1239
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:10,100
Look what I uncovered.

1240
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:20,460
If Marek had come home with us.
what would be written here?

1241
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:24,540
Oh, my God.

1242
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:27,620
