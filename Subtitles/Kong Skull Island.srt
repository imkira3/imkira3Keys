00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:21,079
<i>If we can put this tremendous
machine of ours...</i>

3
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:23,582
<i>...which has made this victory possible...</i>

4
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:25,567
<i>...to work for peace...</i>

5
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:29,102
<i>...we can look forward to the greatest
age in the history of mankind.</i>

6
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:41,082
<i>Speed of progress in the satellite project...</i>

7
00:03:41,182 --> 00:03:45,870
<i>...cannot be taken as an index of
our progress in ballistic missile work.</i>

8
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:53,276
<i>I feel we're on the brink of an area of
expansion of knowledge about ourselves...</i>

9
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:57,505
<i>...and our surroundings that is beyond
description or comprehension at this time.</i>

10
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:04,305
<i>For the first time,
we're putting cameras into space...</i>

11
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:06,441
<i>...and looking down on the Earth...</i>

12
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:10,894
<i>...allowing us to discover places
and things we've never seen.</i>

13
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:16,250
<i>The most intelligent inhabitants
of that future world...</i>

14
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,354
<i>...won't be men or monkeys.
They'll be machines.</i>

15
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:24,292
<i>We set sail on this new sea...</i>

16
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:27,262
<i>...because there is new knowledge
to be gained.</i>

17
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:29,431
<i>Whether this new ocean...</i>

18
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:31,532
<i>...will be a sea of peace...</i>

19
00:04:31,632 --> 00:04:35,185
<i>...or a new terrifying theater of war.</i>

20
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:39,941
<i>"To tame the savageness of man...</i>

21
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,528
<i>...and make gentle the life of this world."</i>

22
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,946
<i>Let us dedicate ourselves to that.</i>

23
00:04:58,524 --> 00:05:01,367
<i>Stop the war! Stop the war!</i>

24
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:06,267
<i>As citywide protests have brought
congressional committee hearings...</i>

25
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:10,337
<i>...to a standstill promising more gridlock
in the days and weeks ahead...</i>

26
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:12,272
<i>...the Beltway is experiencing significant...</i>

27
00:05:12,372 --> 00:05:16,781
Mark my words. There'll never be
a more screwed up time in Washington.

28
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:19,873
But we can't let it stop us.

29
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:24,468
Come on already, let's go!

30
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:26,687
Get out of the way!

31
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:28,622
Maybe now's not the best time to ask.

32
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:32,459
Monarch is on the cusp of being
shut down, Brooks. We're broke!

33
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:35,812
When this war ends, we'll never
get approval for our expedition.

34
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:41,401
I'm not confident in our presentation.

35
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:43,671
I mean, all of our materials are loose leaf.

36
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:47,741
In one day, one day, I could have had
all of this organized and bound.

37
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:52,696
<i>...that we, today, have concluded
an agreement to end the war...</i>

38
00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:55,165
<i>...and bring peace with honor in Vietnam.</i>

39
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:57,802
<i>All American forces will be withdrawn.</i>

40
00:05:57,952 --> 00:06:01,155
We don't have a day. Hello, there.

41
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:04,858
- Bill Randa here to see Senator Willis.
- Of course, Mr. Randa.

42
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:09,162
I left you a message this morning
about rescheduling today's appointment.

43
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:12,516
But he should have something
available in the coming weeks.

44
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:17,383
- Oh, God.
- Al, you're looking well.

45
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,908
So you didn't get the message, Randa?
To reschedule?

46
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:23,910
For the fifth time?
I must've missed it. It'll be quick.

47
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,347
Okay, don't get comfortable. You got
five minutes. I'm late for a meeting.

48
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:31,134
So, what imaginary monster
are you hunting this time?

49
00:06:31,234 --> 00:06:35,575
This is a satellite photo of an uncharted
island in the South Pacific.

50
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:39,085
It has defied discovery until now.

51
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,962
Many civilizations spoke of it in legends.

52
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,215
Skull Island.

53
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:48,401
The land where God did not finish creation.

54
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:52,731
It's notorious for the number of ships
and planes that have gone missing there.

55
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:56,093
Like the Bermuda Triangle?

56
00:06:56,193 --> 00:07:00,598
Or like that aluminum foil hat
that I like to wear on the weekends?

57
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:03,233
It's more like the triangle than the hat...

58
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,036
...but we like to think
it's much more than that.

59
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:09,706
The 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear tests...

60
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:13,210
...weren't tests.
They were trying to kill something.

61
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,181
I believe there's an ecosystem out there
the likes of which we can't imagine.

62
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:21,467
And the place to find it is this island.

63
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,821
A place where myth and science meet.

64
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:27,940
Randa, it's a fairytale.

65
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:35,765
Harry Truman didn't think so
when he funded Monarch in 1946.

66
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:37,717
You know, in terms of sheer waste...

67
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:40,736
...Monarch ranks right up there
with the search for alien life.

68
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,321
Yeah, but those guys are nuts.

69
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:48,398
- We should have shut you down years ago.
- This is an opportunity for our country.

70
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:51,648
Listen, Senator, Landsat is sending
a mission to the island.

71
00:07:51,748 --> 00:07:54,520
We could piggyback on that operation.

72
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,547
- With your permission, of course.
- What're you hoping you'll find?

73
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:01,580
Resources, medicine, the cure for cancer,
geological discoveries.

74
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,495
I mean... possible alternate fuels.
Senator, look, just...

75
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:08,997
Listen, to be honest,
we don't know for sure what's there.

76
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:11,132
Okay? But I will tell you what we do know.

77
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:14,035
Tomorrow night, the Russian Novosat
passes over this sector.

78
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:17,681
And in three days, they're gonna
have the same images we have. So...

79
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:23,195
...whatever's there,
you want us to find it first.

80
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:25,497
Right?

81
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:32,054
I don't believe I'm saying this,
but that almost made sense.

82
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:33,589
Thank you.

83
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:36,524
So, I will get the piggyback for you. I will.

84
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:40,330
But listen to me, listen to me.
This is it. It's gotta end. This is it.

85
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,150
You promise me? Last favor? Okay?

86
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,002
Senator?

87
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:49,921
One last thing.

88
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:53,892
I'm going to need a military escort.

89
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:15,666
<i>Attention, all soldiers and base personnel.</i>

90
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:19,772
<i>Final troop withdrawal will commence at 0600.</i>

91
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:24,073
<i>Pack your bags, ladies. We're going home.</i>

92
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:25,275
- Hey, Mills.
- Yeah?

93
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,042
How many letters did you end up writing her?

94
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:30,752
- Ten, fifteen.
- How many did she write you?

95
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:32,880
I don't know, three, four.

96
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:35,651
Man, you got a shitty mom.

97
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:39,420
Thank you, Cole,
for clearing that up. Thank you.

98
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,522
I'll be sure to tell her
when I see her in the next 48 hours.

99
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,759
Yeah, you might have a shitty mom.

100
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:44,893
Right?

101
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:10,752
Sir?

102
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:12,530
Chapman.

103
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:15,605
You need anything, sir?

104
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:19,105
- All good.
- Roger that.

105
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:23,285
So what're you gonna do when you
get back to the world, Chapman?

106
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:26,468
I'm already set up with Eastern Air Lines.

107
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:29,652
Grace and Billy all moved in
in Atlanta, just...

108
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,857
...waiting on me. What about you, sir?

109
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,695
- All this for what?
- Sir?

110
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:43,301
Get out of here, Chapman. Go have some fun.

111
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:46,337
Is everything okay?

112
00:10:47,488 --> 00:10:48,726
Tip-top.

113
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,124
Colonel Packard!
There's a phone call for you.

114
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:11,793
- This is Packard.
- <i>Packard, it's General Ward.</i>

115
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:16,084
- <i>You and your boys up for one last op?</i>
- I would not be opposed to that, sir.

116
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:20,088
<i>Your orders to head home are already processed.
Sure you don't wanna take some time?</i>

117
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,624
I'm here to execute
whatever orders I'm given, sir.

118
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,228
<i>Don't get too excited.</i>

119
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:28,229
<i>Bunch of scientists called Landsat
discovered a new island on their satellite.</i>

120
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:31,665
<i>They need helicopter transport
for a survey job.</i>

121
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:33,952
Roger that. And, sir?

122
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:35,536
<i>Yes?</i>

123
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:37,470
Thank you.

124
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,549
Randa, I don't get it.
You already got us a military escort.

125
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:53,888
- Why do we need a tracker? And why SAS?
- Former SAS. No allegiance to anyone.

126
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:56,925
And he rescued 12
downed pilots in Danang, in '72.

127
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:59,694
But your source says that he spends
most of his waking hours...

128
00:11:59,794 --> 00:12:01,362
...in some back alley watering hole.

129
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:04,398
Is your Yale degree supposed to
lead us through the jungle, Brooks?

130
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:07,501
Besides, my father told me never
to judge a man by where he drinks...

131
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,392
...only how he holds it.
You on board with me here?

132
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:16,460
You go.

133
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:23,384
Well. Okay.

134
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:25,988
So... how much do we tell him?

135
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:28,756
Just enough to get him to say yes.

136
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:03,406
Now there's a man worth talking to.

137
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:08,930
An uncharted island?
Let me list all the ways you're gonna die.

138
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,728
Rain, heat, mud,
disease carrying flies and mosquitos.

139
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:15,336
Sure, you could load up
on the atabrine for the malaria...

140
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:16,854
...but what about the other bacteria?

141
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:20,974
And we haven't even started on
the things that want to eat you alive.

142
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:25,246
- We'll double that.
- You have no idea how dangerous this is.

143
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,380
I want five times that.

144
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,934
Plus, a bonus if we make it back.

145
00:13:30,034 --> 00:13:31,235
If?

146
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:39,455
Pay him. I mean, I think Mr. Conrad
should be fairly compensated.

147
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:42,897
Here's to profit during peacetime.

148
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:44,831
One question.

149
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:47,401
You came here looking for a tracker.

150
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:50,603
Who or what am I tracking?

151
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:53,174
This is all the information that we have.

152
00:13:53,274 --> 00:13:56,476
Okay? There is no map. Only satellite images.

153
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:59,048
So we need someone like you,
with your skill...

154
00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:01,990
...your unique expertise
in uncharted jungle terrain...

155
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,652
- ...to lead us on our ground expedition.
- We're just scholars and scientists.

156
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:10,578
We need someone with experience.
In case things go sideways.

157
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:14,927
Men go to war in search
of something, Mr. Conrad.

158
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:17,764
If you'd found it...

159
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:20,282
...you'd be home by now.

160
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:42,722
- Weaver.
- <i>Yeah, it's Jerry.</i>

161
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:45,292
Hey, Jerry. So, tell me, did I get it?

162
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:49,028
- <i>That Landsat thing? You got it.</i>
- I did?

163
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:52,799
<i>Hello? It's the Athena, docked in Bangkok.</i>

164
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,385
<i>Pier 14, 6:00 tomorrow night.</i>

165
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:59,776
1800 tomorrow.
Thank you. I really owe you one.

166
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:02,643
<i>I don't get it. Why do you want
a gig documenting a mapping mission...</i>

167
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:05,812
- <i>...when you're up for the cover of Time?</i>
- Jerry, when three sources tell you...

168
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:09,200
...the same thing word for word,
you know they're lying.

169
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,019
<i>There's something going on here,
something that nobody is talking about.</i>

170
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:38,589
I can't believe we're doing this.
Are you guys kidding me? A day away.

171
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:40,831
One day away!

172
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:45,352
And, no, now we gotta go to another
island with another jungle.

173
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:47,853
Vietnam's not an island, dumbass.

174
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:51,657
Well, Key West is, and that's exactly
where I need to be right now...

175
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:54,808
- ...with a drink in my hand.
- Key West ain't an island either...

176
00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:56,780
...it's a key.

177
00:15:58,564 --> 00:16:00,200
You ain't funny, Cole.

178
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:14,113
Mason Weaver, photographer.

179
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:17,090
Mason Weaver is a woman?

180
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,134
Last time I checked.

181
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:25,206
Can I help you?

182
00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:31,160
Two years in country. Where you been?

183
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,167
- Embedded with MACV-SOG.
- You were in the shit.

184
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:40,275
I respect that. But it's people
like you lost us support back home.

185
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:44,376
You're not actually gonna blame the people
without guns for losing the war, are you?

186
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:47,146
Camera's way more dangerous than a gun.

187
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:50,403
And we didn't lose the war, we abandoned it.

188
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:52,489
Right.

189
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:04,030
Hello and welcome. I'm Landsat
Field Supervisor, Victor Nieves.

190
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,167
This is my colleague,
Steve Woodward, our data wrangler.

191
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:12,550
Our expedition takes us to a place every
nautical trade route known to man...

192
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,625
...has avoided for centuries.
As our satellites show...

193
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:20,045
...the island is surrounded
by a perpetual storm system...

194
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:23,814
...allowing it to remain hidden
from the outside world.

195
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:26,618
But with Colonel Packard's
helicopter transport...

196
00:17:26,718 --> 00:17:29,754
...we will be the first to
break through to the other side.

197
00:17:29,854 --> 00:17:32,359
We're also pleased to be joined,
for the first time...

198
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:36,727
...by the resource exploration team
led by Mr. Randa...

199
00:17:36,827 --> 00:17:41,467
...and accompanied by biologist, Miss San,
and geologist, Mr. Brooks.

200
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:46,205
Our focus will be on the island's surface,
theirs, what lies beneath.

201
00:17:46,305 --> 00:17:48,707
- Mr. Brooks.
- Simple, really.

202
00:17:48,807 --> 00:17:51,493
We'll use explosives to shake
the earth and create vibrations...

203
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:54,346
...helping us to map
the subsurface of the island.

204
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:57,615
We'll fly in over the south shore, and
then strategically drop seismic charges...

205
00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:59,951
...to better help us understand
the density of the earth.

206
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:02,136
You're dropping bombs?

207
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:05,588
- Scientific instruments.
- You hear that, boys?

208
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:07,459
We're scientists now!

209
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:10,594
You guys are not scientists.

210
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:15,400
We'll then land and make base camp
for ground excursions led by Mr. Conrad.

211
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,780
- Major Jack Chapman.
- All right.

212
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,647
Once on the island, the storm's interference
will block all radio contact with the ship.

213
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:24,209
That means we'll be by ourselves.

214
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:28,046
Three days later, the refuel team will
meet us here, on the north end of the island.

215
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:32,070
That may be our only safe departure window
for an unknown period of time.

216
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,652
So, tip for everybody...

217
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:36,791
...don't miss it, please.

218
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:02,714
- What are you doing down here?
- I could ask you the same thing.

219
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:06,465
Why does a geological
mapping mission need explosives?

220
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:10,639
You weren't listening in class.
Seismic charges for the geological survey.

221
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:13,958
- You believe that?
- I didn't say that.

222
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:17,129
- Have you met Colonel Packard yet?
- Yeah.

223
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:19,164
The guy's wound pretty tight.

224
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:23,067
Well, the man's a decorated war hero.
That's the package they come in.

225
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,069
And you?

226
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:28,472
Isn't shooting a mapping mission
a step down for a photojournalist?

227
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:32,310
- The right photo can help shape opinions.
- And win you a Pulitzer.

228
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,680
Okay, Captain Conrad. What about you?

229
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,449
How did British special forces
get dragged into this?

230
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:40,984
Just "Conrad." I'm decommissioned.

231
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:45,024
- They offered me money.
- You don't strike me as a mercenary.

232
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:47,608
You don't strike me as a war photographer.

233
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,760
Anti-war photographer.

234
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:13,051
What you writing there, Chap?

235
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:15,001
Letter to my boy.

236
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,522
"Dear Billy. I know I said
I'd be home by your birthday...

237
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:22,743
...but I lied straight to your face.
I'm a terrible dad.

238
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:25,045
I hope this letter makes up for it."

239
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,167
That's too short.

240
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,794
This storm looks a lot nastier in person.

241
00:20:56,894 --> 00:20:59,564
Maybe we should consider
postponing the mission.

242
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:03,020
- How far away is this island?
- 50 miles, maybe more.

243
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,316
- Take us closer.
- You wanna launch, you do it from here.

244
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,205
Can you punch through that, Colonel?
Our opening is now.

245
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:12,177
- Through this hole right here?
- Yeah, it's a rare low-pressure pocket.

246
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:13,944
I appreciate your passion, Randa...

247
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:17,353
...but as Field Supervisor of the
controlling agency, I say we abort.

248
00:21:17,453 --> 00:21:19,151
That's it, we're gonna abort.

249
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:23,204
Wise call. I'm sure the Landsat inspector
will be inspired by your courage.

250
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:26,590
No, he'll be inspired by my common sense.
This is only a map survey.

251
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,292
To one of the last uncharted areas
on the face of the Earth.

252
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:32,462
And you wanna call it on account of rain?
Stay on the boat if you want to.

253
00:21:32,562 --> 00:21:35,799
It could be years before
we get another shot at this.

254
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:39,280
I'm told your unit is capable
of handling inclement weather, Colonel.

255
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,740
Why don't we leave it to
Colonel Packard to break the tie?

256
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,273
There is no way
I'm getting on that helicopter.

257
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,053
We did ask to arm those helicopters.
Shouldn't they know why?

258
00:21:56,153 --> 00:21:58,822
Why? And raise an alarm?

259
00:21:58,922 --> 00:22:01,340
Purely a precaution, Brooks.

260
00:22:02,926 --> 00:22:05,896
- Right.
- <i>Two mikes till launch.</i>

261
00:22:05,996 --> 00:22:10,049
<i>Troops and civilians, board assigned
aircraft. Two mikes till launch.</i>

262
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:21,577
What's the old man getting us into, Cole?

263
00:22:21,677 --> 00:22:24,214
Nothing he wouldn't do himself.
He's taking the lead.

264
00:22:24,314 --> 00:22:27,785
I mean, doesn't he miss his bed?
I miss my bed! Don't you miss your bed?

265
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:31,437
Do you even have a bed, Cole?

266
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:34,466
You got a bed, right?

267
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:38,695
- See you at the rendezvous, Chapman.
- Yes, sir.

268
00:22:54,476 --> 00:22:57,746
<i>Complete FOD walkdown and clear the deck.</i>

269
00:22:57,846 --> 00:22:59,148
<i>One mike to launch.</i>

270
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:00,303
- Battery?
- Check.

271
00:23:00,403 --> 00:23:02,348
- Generator start?
- Check, check.

272
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:05,270
- Engine start?
- Check three times.

273
00:23:06,322 --> 00:23:08,725
<i>This is Fox Leader to Fox Group.</i>

274
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:12,561
It is time, once again,
for the Griffin and ant show.

275
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:17,671
<i>As usual, remember, hold on to your butts!</i>

276
00:23:19,435 --> 00:23:23,272
<i>Attention, pilots.
You are cleared for takeoff.</i>

277
00:23:23,372 --> 00:23:26,025
<i>Launch, launch, launch.</i>

278
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:47,913
<i>Combat formation.</i>

279
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:50,198
Keep visual.

280
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:53,117
Fox Five, let me know when you close.

281
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,307
Fox Five is in the slot.

282
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:58,874
Roger that.

283
00:23:58,974 --> 00:24:02,460
<i>Fox team, form up on me. Keep it together!</i>

284
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:09,021
<i>Let's do this!</i>

285
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:19,779
<i>Maintain course.</i>

286
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:21,836
<i>Nothing we haven't done before.</i>

287
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:24,632
"Dear Billy.

288
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:27,669
<i>"You ever looked into
a hurricane and decide...</i>

289
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,340
<i>'...maybe I should fly straight through it?'</i>

290
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,671
<i>"Because that's what's about to happen."</i>

291
00:24:34,877 --> 00:24:37,984
Dear Billy. You might wanna hang on.

292
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:06,232
Fox Leader to Fox Group.
Switch to inertial navigation.

293
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:09,311
<i>And remember the story of Icarus...</i>

294
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:12,449
<i>...whose father gave him wings made of wax...</i>

295
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:15,717
...and warned him not to fly
too close to the sun.

296
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:20,990
<i>But the exhilaration was too great,
so he flew higher and higher...</i>

297
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,360
<i>...until the sun melted his wings...</i>

298
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,879
...and he fell into the sea.

299
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:31,499
<i>But the United States Army
is not an irresponsible father.</i>

300
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:35,737
<i>So they gave us wings
of white-hot, cold-rolled...</i>

301
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:38,289
...Pennsylvania steel.

302
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:42,293
<i>Guaranteed not to melt.</i>

303
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:29,667
Hey, that's pretty, huh?

304
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:37,381
Let's take them down, low and level.

305
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,424
Fox Leader to Fox Group.
Split up, survey your zones.

306
00:27:23,624 --> 00:27:26,415
<i>Fox Seven, put Landsat on deck.</i>

307
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,683
<i>Copy, Fox Leader.
Fox Three headed to Zone Six.</i>

308
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:31,720
Put us down over there.

309
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,271
<i>Everyone else, stay with the team leader.</i>

310
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:39,243
Move that gear to our three o'clock.
Let's go, let's move it!

311
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:04,701
- Ready for seismic charges.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

312
00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:08,885
<i>Fox Group, let it fly.</i>

313
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,567
<i>Copy all, Fox Three. Heading 0-9-0.</i>

314
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,443
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

315
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:28,425
The seismic response is incredible.

316
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:40,137
Hey, Randa, you're not gonna believe this.

317
00:28:40,237 --> 00:28:42,106
The bedrock...

318
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:44,457
<i>...it's practically hollow.</i>

319
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:56,802
Incoming!

320
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,268
Look out!

321
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:01,017
<i>On guard, Fox Five!
Fox Eight is down! Fox Four is down!</i>

322
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:02,869
Respond, Fox Three!

323
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:13,830
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- <i>Fox Seven moving into position, 3 o'clock.</i>

324
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,534
- <i>Does anybody know what that is?</i>
- <i>I don't know, man...</i>

325
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,537
<i>Three klicks west of Red LZ.</i>

326
00:30:20,637 --> 00:30:24,307
- <i>Jesus! I've never seen anything like it!</i>
- <i>Set a perimeter of 300 meters.</i>

327
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:27,043
<i>Roger. Climb 1,800.</i>

328
00:30:44,495 --> 00:30:47,430
- Is that a monkey?
- <i>What the hell is that?</i>

329
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:51,467
- <i>Somebody talk to me, man.</i>
- <i>Turn right, heading 2-5-0. Contact...</i>

330
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:54,453
<i>Fox Leader to Fox Group. Form a perimeter.</i>

331
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,105
<i>Ready gunner positions.</i>

332
00:30:56,205 --> 00:31:00,076
Holy shit. Look at that thing!
I'm freaking out here!

333
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:04,011
<i>Fox Leader to Fox Group. Fire at will!</i>

334
00:31:05,723 --> 00:31:08,401
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know!

335
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:27,804
- Pull out now! Pull out!
- I don't take orders from you!

336
00:31:27,904 --> 00:31:31,122
- Get us the hell out of here!
- <i>Fox Nine is down!</i>

337
00:31:34,777 --> 00:31:39,031
Fox Six, we got nominal control.
We are going down.

338
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:48,591
Fox Five, this is Fox Leader. Fox Nine
is down, one klick north of river bend.

339
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:52,710
- Insert recovery team. Over.
- Fox Five is hovering.

340
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:55,464
We got men going out the door!

341
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,353
- <i>I need help here. I need...</i>
- Oh, shit!

342
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:12,881
- Kill this son of a bitch.
- <i>Coming in hot! I got eyes on it!</i>

343
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:14,866
Pull up!

344
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:24,075
Brace for impact!

345
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:31,683
<i>Mayday, mayday, mayday!</i>

346
00:32:32,635 --> 00:32:34,686
Run to the side, you idiot!

347
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,765
- Hang on!
- Watch out!

348
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,402
Oh, God!

349
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:56,124
- Prepare to crash!
- Brace!

350
00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:08,369
Fox Leader is down!
Fox Five inbound for pickup!

351
00:33:08,469 --> 00:33:12,690
We have him in sight! Hold tight,
Colonel Packard, we are on our way!

352
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:19,997
Hang on, Briggs. I'm coming.

353
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:36,513
We're going down!
I repeat, we are going down!

354
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,523
Listen, I want you to tell me
something right now.

355
00:33:40,623 --> 00:33:42,403
- Do you love your mama?
- I love her!

356
00:33:42,503 --> 00:33:46,722
- How much do you love your mama?
- I love my mama so much!

357
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:12,128
Calling all units. Is anybody airborne?
I repeat, is anybody airborne?

358
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:15,563
They're all down. Every one of them.

359
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:20,367
We're on the south side of the island.
There's a river a couple of klicks from here.

360
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:23,538
If we stick to its banks, we'll make it
to the exfil site on the north shore.

361
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:26,909
And then what? All our choppers are down.

362
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:30,346
We'll find a way to signal the ship.
They'll send a search party.

363
00:35:30,446 --> 00:35:35,109
- We just have to make it by the exit window.
- I... I should be sitting at a desk.

364
00:35:35,209 --> 00:35:37,818
So, wait, are we just not
gonna talk about this?

365
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:40,572
My best guess is we're scattered
over a four to five mile radius.

366
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,125
We should head north and join
anyone we find. Are you all right?

367
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,367
I don't know how to answer
that question right now.

368
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:48,317
I don't know what that was either.

369
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:51,966
All that money that they paid you?
I hope you're worth it.

370
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,670
We're really not gonna talk about it?
You know this is not normal, right?

371
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,254
Stuff like that doesn't just happen!

372
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:03,306
<i>This is Fox Leader to Fox Group!
Anybody with ears, come back.</i>

373
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:06,714
- <i>Respond. Over.</i>
- Fox, Chapman.

374
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:09,350
Fox Six, Chapman. Say again, your last.

375
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,454
<i>Four klicks west, highest peak,
November Alpha 3, 0, 0. Over.</i>

376
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:18,960
Roger that, Chapman.
West highest mountain peak. Over.

377
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,572
Fox Six confirm, we're at the Sea Stallion.

378
00:36:21,672 --> 00:36:25,154
Chapman, hold your position.
We'll come to you.

379
00:36:25,254 --> 00:36:28,087
There's enough munitions
on that Sea Stallion to kill this thing.

380
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:32,206
Survey your perimeter.
Locate possible ambush sites. Over.

381
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,859
Chapman.

382
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:40,998
Reles, taking an R and R day,
or you good to go?

383
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:43,249
I'm good to go, sir.

384
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:49,905
Chapman to all stations. Recon environment.

385
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:09,459
Cole, what's wrong with you?
How you even got an appetite right now?

386
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:13,748
Eating's for the living.

387
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:17,280
We just got taken down by a monkey
the size of a building!

388
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,935
Yeah.

389
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,461
That was an unconventional encounter.

390
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:26,159
Is that really all your brain
telling itself right now?

391
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:29,946
There's no tactical precedence.
We did the best we could in the situation.

392
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:34,416
Griffin Co.!

393
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:42,592
Thank God you guys are okay.

394
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:47,981
- Good to see you, sir.
- We're all right.

395
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:51,018
- How many left?
- Seven survivors.

396
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:55,589
Seven confirmed KIA.
Galleta, Saraf, and Hodges.

397
00:37:56,289 --> 00:37:58,306
Slivko and the rest are unknown.

398
00:38:12,171 --> 00:38:13,399
Where's Randa?

399
00:38:16,312 --> 00:38:18,979
- How you doing?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

400
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,364
Good. Glad to hear it.
I was worried about you.

401
00:38:26,853 --> 00:38:30,990
You are going to tell me
everything I don't know...

402
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,114
...or I'm gonna blow your head off.

403
00:38:35,361 --> 00:38:37,397
Monsters exist.

404
00:38:37,497 --> 00:38:39,380
No shit.

405
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,347
Nobody believed me.

406
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:43,685
Yesterday, I was a crackpot.

407
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:48,945
- But today...
- So this was never about geology.

408
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:52,093
You dropped those charges
to flush something out.

409
00:38:52,712 --> 00:38:56,315
- Who are you?
- You heard of the USS Lawton?

410
00:38:56,415 --> 00:38:58,051
Neither did the public.

411
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:02,422
Out of a thousand young men
on that ship, I was the only survivor.

412
00:39:02,522 --> 00:39:05,824
They told my family she was sunk
in battle, but I know what I saw.

413
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:07,961
It had no conscience.

414
00:39:08,761 --> 00:39:11,129
No reasoning, just destroy.

415
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:16,136
I spent the last 30 years trying to prove
the truth of what I learned that day.

416
00:39:17,086 --> 00:39:19,577
This planet doesn't belong to us.

417
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:24,176
Ancient species owned this earth
long before mankind.

418
00:39:24,276 --> 00:39:28,314
And if we keep our heads buried
in the sand, they will take it back.

419
00:39:28,414 --> 00:39:30,076
My agency is known as Monarch.

420
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:33,916
We specialize in the hunt for Massive
Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms.

421
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:36,222
You knew that thing was out here?

422
00:39:36,322 --> 00:39:39,774
I'm sorry for your men, Colonel, I truly am.

423
00:39:40,693 --> 00:39:43,695
Get us home, with proof.

424
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:46,167
So we can send the cavalry.

425
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,029
I am the cavalry.

426
00:40:01,312 --> 00:40:04,687
It's called the Hollow Earth theory.
Randa hired me...

427
00:40:04,787 --> 00:40:09,521
...because I wrote a paper substantiating
what most people think is a crackpot idea.

428
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:14,494
That there are these massive underground
spaces isolated from the surface world.

429
00:40:14,594 --> 00:40:18,196
Passageways. Randa believed
this island may be one of those.

430
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:20,999
An emergence point for whatever lives below.

431
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:23,587
Ancient species like what we just saw.

432
00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:25,972
I thought he was out of his mind.

433
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:29,107
This is Slivko. Do you read?
Anybody out there?

434
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:33,662
We're headed north to the exfil location.
Everyone here seems way too calm right now.

435
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:37,016
- Do you copy? Anybody?
- We're out of range, Slivko.

436
00:40:37,116 --> 00:40:38,149
Oh, shit.

437
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:40,668
Save it for when we get closer to the group.

438
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:53,714
Nobody move.

439
00:40:56,201 --> 00:40:58,085
Easy.

440
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:15,646
- Slivko.
- What?

441
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:22,010
Put it down.

442
00:41:42,998 --> 00:41:46,622
These men did not die in vain.

443
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:48,888
I swear to God...

444
00:41:49,388 --> 00:41:53,641
...their deaths will not go unanswered.

445
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:00,846
Now let's get to Chapman and those munitions.

446
00:42:08,572 --> 00:42:11,859
You ever heard the story of the mouse,
the lion, and the thorn?

447
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:14,916
- Yeah.
- There you go then.

448
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:17,096
In case we ever see that primate again.

449
00:42:18,016 --> 00:42:21,052
You do know that story is about a mouse
becoming friends with the lion...

450
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:24,370
...after taking the thorn
out of his paw though, right?

451
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:28,679
No, it's not. The mouse
kills the lion with the thorn.

452
00:42:30,227 --> 00:42:32,078
Who told you that, Cole?

453
00:42:32,764 --> 00:42:34,648
My mother.

454
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:41,354
That actually explains a lot.

455
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:09,067
Look out! Oh, shit!

456
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:10,668
- Watch out!
- What is it?

457
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:12,803
- Watch your six!
- Up above!

458
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:15,520
- Up in the trees!
- Guns up!

459
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:23,380
Cole!

460
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,282
- No, no!
- Mills!

461
00:43:25,382 --> 00:43:27,266
We got you!

462
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:29,654
I can't get a shot!

463
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,843
Cut the legs! Cut it off at the legs!

464
00:44:05,307 --> 00:44:08,791
I got you! Go!

465
00:44:32,615 --> 00:44:35,419
Shake it off, guys! Let's move out.

466
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:42,374
Stay tight.

467
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:50,215
What the hell is this?

468
00:45:37,045 --> 00:45:39,649
- Behind you!
- Everybody, stay calm, stay calm.

469
00:45:39,749 --> 00:45:43,019
- Conrad.
- Stay back! Stay back!

470
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,956
- Guys.
- Stop, stop. Stop, stop!

471
00:45:46,056 --> 00:45:48,473
Nobody shoot! Nobody shoot!

472
00:45:59,334 --> 00:46:02,221
No, no, no. No need for that. Come on now.

473
00:46:02,321 --> 00:46:04,790
Everybody, keep your wigs on now!

474
00:46:06,509 --> 00:46:07,878
What?

475
00:46:07,978 --> 00:46:11,164
I didn't believe it
when they said you were coming.

476
00:46:11,264 --> 00:46:16,067
I was up all night just thinking about how
me and Gunpei dreamed of this moment.

477
00:46:16,418 --> 00:46:19,788
And now here it is. 28 years, 11 months...

478
00:46:19,888 --> 00:46:22,691
...and eight failed attempts
to get back to the world...

479
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:24,821
...and instead the world comes to me?

480
00:46:25,421 --> 00:46:27,403
Ain't that a crack?

481
00:46:28,298 --> 00:46:30,099
They never smile.

482
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:32,768
Did you crash here?

483
00:46:33,182 --> 00:46:37,341
Sorry, miss.
Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.

484
00:46:37,941 --> 00:46:40,177
Put the old flight suit on for you.

485
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:45,381
You are more beautiful...

486
00:46:45,781 --> 00:46:48,384
...than a hotdog and a beer...

487
00:46:48,484 --> 00:46:51,370
...at Wrigley Field on opening day.

488
00:46:57,694 --> 00:46:59,511
But you're real.

489
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:03,281
Right?

490
00:47:05,066 --> 00:47:08,420
I told you. Didn't I tell you? I said...

491
00:47:08,705 --> 00:47:10,789
"It's fine."

492
00:47:11,474 --> 00:47:13,142
There we go.

493
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:18,741
There's something out there, man.

494
00:47:18,841 --> 00:47:20,884
Oh, there's a lot out there.

495
00:47:21,184 --> 00:47:23,526
Now, come on. We gotta get home.

496
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:26,405
You don't wanna be out here at night.

497
00:50:17,025 --> 00:50:20,695
You probably noticed a lot
of weird things on this island.

498
00:50:21,495 --> 00:50:25,548
As long as we stay in here where
the people live, we'll be all right.

499
00:50:26,467 --> 00:50:30,448
That wall, is that supposed
to keep out that thing?

500
00:50:30,548 --> 00:50:33,991
No, he's not the one
they're trying to keep out.

501
00:50:34,843 --> 00:50:36,143
What?

502
00:50:36,243 --> 00:50:39,847
These people live up on top of the trees
while we're down on the roots.

503
00:50:39,947 --> 00:50:42,431
Some of them don't even seem to age.

504
00:50:42,842 --> 00:50:46,121
There's no crime, no personal property.

505
00:50:46,721 --> 00:50:48,772
They're past all that.

506
00:51:01,036 --> 00:51:03,721
Thank you. Thank you.

507
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:06,773
So, good news.

508
00:51:06,873 --> 00:51:09,125
They say you can shack up here.

509
00:51:10,711 --> 00:51:12,579
I didn't hear them say anything.

510
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:14,782
Oh, they don't speak too much.

511
00:51:14,882 --> 00:51:18,586
When you've been here as long as I have,
you start to understand. You'll see.

512
00:51:18,686 --> 00:51:21,474
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.
We can't stay here.

513
00:51:21,574 --> 00:51:24,459
We have to get off the island.
We have lives. I have a life.

514
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,394
Nieves, now is not the time. All right?

515
00:51:27,494 --> 00:51:29,946
What lands here tends to stay here.

516
00:51:31,899 --> 00:51:36,304
As far as I can tell, this ship
washed up about 10 years before I did.

517
00:51:36,404 --> 00:51:38,813
- You've been here since '44?
- Yeah.

518
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:41,208
Hey, what happened with the war? Did we win?

519
00:51:41,308 --> 00:51:43,107
Which one?

520
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:45,228
That makes sense.

521
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:50,097
This is all hallowed ground to them. So if
you like your hands, don't touch anything.

522
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:07,150
Look at that.

523
00:52:21,614 --> 00:52:27,217
The way they tell it for thousands of years,
the people on this island lived in fear.

524
00:52:28,255 --> 00:52:30,706
That's a hell of a long time to be scared.

525
00:52:34,194 --> 00:52:37,598
And then, one day,
the damnedest thing happened.

526
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:40,412
Some of the things they were afraid of
started protecting them...

527
00:52:40,512 --> 00:52:42,919
...against the things that were eating them.

528
00:52:44,971 --> 00:52:47,189
But nothing lasts forever, I guess.

529
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:56,967
And this is where they honor
the last of their saviors.

530
00:53:04,024 --> 00:53:05,540
Yeah.

531
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:07,609
That's Kong.

532
00:53:11,565 --> 00:53:13,583
<i>He's king around here.</i>

533
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,921
<i>He's God to these people.</i>

534
00:53:19,972 --> 00:53:21,879
Kong's a pretty good king.

535
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:24,427
Keeps to himself mostly.

536
00:53:27,214 --> 00:53:30,639
<i>This is his home. We're just guests here.</i>

537
00:53:32,484 --> 00:53:36,044
But you don't go into someone's
house and start dropping bombs...

538
00:53:36,144 --> 00:53:38,238
...unless you're picking a fight.

539
00:53:38,338 --> 00:53:41,210
Wasn't Kong the one who killed your friend?

540
00:53:42,388 --> 00:53:43,899
No.

541
00:53:45,165 --> 00:53:47,016
One of them did.

542
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:50,269
Kong's god on the island...

543
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,994
...but the devils live below us.

544
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,457
And what are they called?

545
00:53:57,744 --> 00:54:00,180
The Iwis won't speak their name.

546
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,531
But I call them skull-crawlers.

547
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:04,450
Why?

548
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,601
'Cause it sounds neat.

549
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,924
- Okay.
- Look, I just made that name up.

550
00:54:11,024 --> 00:54:13,426
- I'm trying to scare you.
- I'm fine calling them that.

551
00:54:13,526 --> 00:54:16,696
- Are you cool with that? I like the name...
- Yeah, that seems like a great name.

552
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:20,500
I've never said that name out loud before.
It sounds stupid now that I say it. Just...

553
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:25,083
You call them whatever you want.
They're big lizard things. Nasty.

554
00:54:26,105 --> 00:54:29,958
<i>They come from the vents deep down.
That's why Kong got so mad.</i>

555
00:54:32,279 --> 00:54:34,531
<i>Those bombs woke up a bunch of them.</i>

556
00:54:38,184 --> 00:54:42,390
<i>I tell you what. You're lucky he's out there,
too, or you wouldn't have made it this far.</i>

557
00:54:42,956 --> 00:54:46,174
<i>They're crafty bastards. Mean as hell.</i>

558
00:54:50,962 --> 00:54:54,650
<i>Now, he can handle them as long as he
gets to them when they're still small.</i>

559
00:54:58,113 --> 00:55:00,926
- You don't wanna wake up the big one.
- How big is it?

560
00:55:01,026 --> 00:55:03,906
It's bigger. It wiped out his whole family.

561
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,711
Kong's the last of his kind,
but he's still growing.

562
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:10,470
And you better hope he does.
Because the Iwis say once Kong goes...

563
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,780
...then the big one comes up.

564
00:55:14,053 --> 00:55:16,324
Then it's, "Goodnight, Irene."

565
00:55:17,224 --> 00:55:21,511
Listen, there's a refueling team coming to
the north end of the island in three days.

566
00:55:21,611 --> 00:55:24,963
- You should come with us.
- To the north end of the island?

567
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:28,167
- We're gonna get out of here.
- In three days?

568
00:55:28,267 --> 00:55:29,829
Yes.

569
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:39,025
You can't get to the north end
in three days. It's impossible.

570
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:41,196
That's it. No way.

571
00:55:44,483 --> 00:55:46,501
At least not on foot.

572
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,494
That is one ugly ass bird.

573
00:56:29,126 --> 00:56:32,346
Dear Billy, this place is hell.

574
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:39,069
And monsters exist.
Under beds and signing paychecks.

575
00:56:39,672 --> 00:56:41,069
Come on, man. Seems like...

576
00:56:41,169 --> 00:56:44,662
Like maybe he wants to go kill that ape
instead of getting us off this island? Yeah!

577
00:56:44,762 --> 00:56:46,780
- Are we even gonna make it?
- Make what?

578
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,280
The exfil! We gotta be there in three days!

579
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,637
- We'll make it. We're gonna make it.
- But, Cole, what happens if Chapman's...

580
00:56:52,737 --> 00:56:55,636
Hey, the Colonel said he's there, he's there.

581
00:57:01,561 --> 00:57:03,462
We were this close to getting it working.

582
00:57:03,562 --> 00:57:07,130
Me and Gunpei were gonna take off
for the open sea, try to get home.

583
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,249
That's when one of them things got him.

584
00:57:12,237 --> 00:57:14,121
There she is.

585
00:57:24,782 --> 00:57:26,632
Well, that's lovely.

586
00:57:28,954 --> 00:57:30,839
You're damn right.

587
00:57:38,964 --> 00:57:40,799
Does this thing even float?

588
00:57:41,244 --> 00:57:44,918
Me and Gunpei spent six years
of our lives building this thing.

589
00:57:45,703 --> 00:57:47,905
She's called the Grey Fox.

590
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:49,823
And she floats.

591
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:02,819
Pulled the engine parts
from my P-51 and his old Zero.

592
00:58:02,919 --> 00:58:05,405
Found a B-29 on the beach one day.
That was something.

593
00:58:05,505 --> 00:58:09,710
You gotta be kidding me. That thing
looks like it's made out of pure tetanus.

594
00:58:11,162 --> 00:58:15,422
I know she ain't pretty to look at, but it's
nothing a couple of extra hands can't fix.

595
00:58:15,522 --> 00:58:18,584
Unless you got a better idea,
I suggest we get cracking.

596
00:58:21,105 --> 00:58:22,986
All right.

597
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,470
Come on, get up!

598
01:01:06,336 --> 01:01:09,188
Well, would you look at that?

599
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:11,490
It bleeds.

600
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:15,251
- Wha...
- We did that.

601
01:01:15,611 --> 01:01:19,882
We hook up with Chapman, there's enough
munitions on that downed Sea Stallion...

602
01:01:19,982 --> 01:01:21,790
...to finish the job.

603
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,527
Magnificent.

604
01:01:30,627 --> 01:01:33,430
You know why I carry this instead of an M-16?

605
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:37,687
Took it off a farmer fighting for the NVA.

606
01:01:37,787 --> 01:01:40,046
He surrendered right after
we leveled his village.

607
01:01:40,336 --> 01:01:43,616
He was 50 years old. Said he'd never
even seen a gun till we showed up.

608
01:01:43,906 --> 01:01:47,592
Sometimes, an enemy doesn't exist...

609
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,579
...till you go looking for one.

610
01:01:50,779 --> 01:01:53,649
What happens when they
show up on your doorstep?

611
01:01:53,749 --> 01:01:55,633
I'll still have his gun.

612
01:01:57,019 --> 01:01:59,104
Best of luck with that, soldier.

613
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,551
Okay. So, we've got 48 hours
to make it to the north shore.

614
01:02:11,651 --> 01:02:14,142
Slivko, do you know
what you're doing back there?

615
01:02:14,242 --> 01:02:17,305
Yeah. My pop's a mechanic.
If I can't fix this, he'll disown me.

616
01:02:17,756 --> 01:02:19,760
If he ever sees me again.

617
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:23,662
Hold the phone there, Churchill.
Russia was our ally.

618
01:02:23,762 --> 01:02:25,478
Now, you're saying we're at war with them?

619
01:02:25,578 --> 01:02:28,701
- It's more of a cold war.
- Cold war like...

620
01:02:28,801 --> 01:02:31,085
...like they take the summers off?

621
01:02:32,504 --> 01:02:34,941
What about the Cubs?
The Cubs win a World Series yet?

622
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:38,612
The Cubs? Man, not even close.
Were they ever good?

623
01:02:38,712 --> 01:02:40,546
Happens to be my team. Where are you from?

624
01:02:40,646 --> 01:02:41,947
- Detroit.
- Okay.

625
01:02:42,047 --> 01:02:44,917
Yeah, the Tigers.
Did they win at all this year?

626
01:02:45,017 --> 01:02:46,932
- I don't know.
- I doubt it. Yeah.

627
01:02:47,032 --> 01:02:48,688
I'd pick the Cubbies over the Tigers any day.

628
01:02:48,788 --> 01:02:51,891
Who do you think would win in a fight?
A tiger or a cub?

629
01:02:51,991 --> 01:02:54,027
A tiger would win.

630
01:02:54,127 --> 01:02:56,630
Yeah, because a cub is a baby bear.

631
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:59,381
A full-grown tiger can eat a baby bear.

632
01:03:00,498 --> 01:03:02,549
Gotta think it through.

633
01:03:03,068 --> 01:03:05,388
We also put a man on the moon.

634
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:09,289
No kidding? What did they do?
Just leave him up there?

635
01:03:09,809 --> 01:03:14,027
- What's he eating?
- Tang. Spam.

636
01:03:15,448 --> 01:03:18,012
Come on, we're losing daylight.

637
01:03:23,389 --> 01:03:25,592
<i>Fox Leader, this is Chapman, over.</i>

638
01:03:26,732 --> 01:03:29,394
<i>Fox Leader, this is Chapman, over.</i>

639
01:03:39,138 --> 01:03:41,007
Dear Billy...

640
01:03:41,307 --> 01:03:43,860
"...sometimes, life just punch you
in the balls.

641
01:03:44,725 --> 01:03:46,574
Damn it.

642
01:04:36,228 --> 01:04:38,262
What kind of music is that?

643
01:04:38,462 --> 01:04:41,333
What happened to swing? Benny Goodman?

644
01:04:41,433 --> 01:04:45,853
You're like a time-traveler, man.
I'm telling you, this is the new sound.

645
01:04:52,443 --> 01:04:54,870
I don't know if I'm gonna like
whoever's under this beard.

646
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:58,410
I really hope that thing you call a boat
can get us upriver in 36 hours.

647
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:02,999
Because if we miss that window,
we're literally, up a creek.

648
01:05:04,389 --> 01:05:07,158
When I first wrote that paper
on the Hollow Earth theory...

649
01:05:07,258 --> 01:05:09,543
...the whole committee laughed out loud.

650
01:05:10,195 --> 01:05:11,863
Not Randa.

651
01:05:11,963 --> 01:05:15,433
The one guy in the crowd
who actually took me seriously.

652
01:05:15,533 --> 01:05:20,188
It felt good. Then I thought he was crazy
when he said the earth was full of monsters.

653
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:23,521
I can't tell when I'm talking
or when I'm not talking.

654
01:05:23,621 --> 01:05:24,851
- You're talking.
- Am I?

655
01:05:24,951 --> 01:05:26,541
- Yes.
- I'm talking?

656
01:05:26,641 --> 01:05:28,513
- Yes.
- Your mouth is moving.

657
01:05:28,613 --> 01:05:29,681
What?

658
01:05:29,781 --> 01:05:32,350
I'm gonna stab you by the end of the night.

659
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:33,951
Really?

660
01:05:34,515 --> 01:05:36,389
Just kidding.

661
01:05:39,891 --> 01:05:43,727
If the boat doesn't work,
we'll just take the train.

662
01:05:43,827 --> 01:05:48,488
Isn't it odd the most dangerous places
are always the most beautiful?

663
01:05:49,173 --> 01:05:53,522
I'm trying to take a long-exposure
photograph, but my flashlight broke.

664
01:05:56,856 --> 01:05:58,476
Try this.

665
01:05:58,576 --> 01:06:00,427
Thank you.

666
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,315
- Royal Air Force?
- It was my father's.

667
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:08,019
He threw it to me from the train
as he rolled off to fight the Nazis.

668
01:06:08,919 --> 01:06:11,255
He was like John Wayne to me.

669
01:06:11,355 --> 01:06:13,440
Some kind of mythic hero.

670
01:06:14,392 --> 01:06:18,895
- Did he come back?
- His plane went down near Hamburg.

671
01:06:18,995 --> 01:06:21,247
They searched for him for months but...

672
01:06:25,003 --> 01:06:27,455
...I suppose no man comes home from war.

673
01:06:28,933 --> 01:06:30,791
Not really.

674
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:42,630
Mills, quit dicking around.
I'm going on perimeter.

675
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:55,347
Colonel Packard...

676
01:06:56,734 --> 01:07:00,988
...this mission to the crash site is folly.

677
01:07:02,205 --> 01:07:04,633
I understand going after your man.

678
01:07:05,709 --> 01:07:07,560
But the rest of it...

679
01:07:08,945 --> 01:07:10,997
...this is beyond us.

680
01:07:12,015 --> 01:07:14,251
You don't like the way I'm running things?

681
01:07:15,051 --> 01:07:17,103
You know where the door is.

682
01:07:18,856 --> 01:07:22,160
<i>You set this in motion
when you put this place on the map.</i>

683
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,279
<i>And I will not cut and run.</i>

684
01:07:27,748 --> 01:07:30,207
<i>I know an enemy when I see it.</i>

685
01:07:58,194 --> 01:08:00,660
This man's name was Gunpei Ikari.

686
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:06,153
But you take away the uniforms...

687
01:08:06,603 --> 01:08:08,454
<i>...and the war...</i>

688
01:08:09,205 --> 01:08:10,889
...he became my brother.

689
01:08:13,778 --> 01:08:16,830
And we swore we'd never
leave each other behind.

690
01:08:22,919 --> 01:08:25,136
Let's get off this island.

691
01:08:34,964 --> 01:08:36,895
- Not yet!
- Prime the lines.

692
01:08:36,995 --> 01:08:38,848
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

693
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,909
Wind it up, let's go!

694
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,914
Keep going!

695
01:08:46,977 --> 01:08:49,614
Third time's the charm.
Here we go. Here we go!

696
01:08:49,714 --> 01:08:52,031
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

697
01:08:52,131 --> 01:08:54,782
Come on, come on, come on.

698
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:57,247
Yes.

699
01:09:00,523 --> 01:09:02,992
Yes! Yes!

700
01:09:27,683 --> 01:09:29,501
I guess this is goodbye.

701
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,404
Thank you.

702
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:44,349
If you're ever in Chicago,
look me up, I guess.

703
01:11:12,121 --> 01:11:14,605
Here, no. Let me... let me help.

704
01:11:15,256 --> 01:11:17,192
Man's gotta do what...

705
01:11:17,292 --> 01:11:19,562
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

706
01:11:19,662 --> 01:11:21,463
Allow me.

707
01:11:21,963 --> 01:11:23,782
You should see me in the library.

708
01:11:26,534 --> 01:11:28,304
I got a wife.

709
01:11:28,404 --> 01:11:31,256
Had a wife. Have a wife?

710
01:11:32,307 --> 01:11:34,392
Guess I don't know anymore.

711
01:11:35,409 --> 01:11:37,611
We got hitched right before I deployed.

712
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:40,082
Got a telegram from her
the day before I got shot down.

713
01:11:40,182 --> 01:11:42,284
She said we just had our baby boy.

714
01:11:42,384 --> 01:11:46,139
I got a son out there.
Grown man I've never met.

715
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,290
Yeah, she definitely thinks you're dead, man.

716
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:50,041
Hey!

717
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:53,782
- I'm just saying.
- You don't know that.

718
01:11:53,882 --> 01:11:56,192
You'd be surprised how long people wait.

719
01:11:56,292 --> 01:11:58,938
Truth is, I don't expect them to be waiting.

720
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,337
I'd be fine either way.

721
01:12:02,337 --> 01:12:04,990
I just want one last chance to see them.

722
01:12:05,741 --> 01:12:07,609
That'd be good enough for me.

723
01:12:08,309 --> 01:12:10,144
We're gonna get you home.

724
01:12:10,544 --> 01:12:13,114
<i>Fox Five, come back.
Is there anyone out there?</i>

725
01:12:13,214 --> 01:12:15,384
Hey! This is Fox Five. We hear you.

726
01:12:15,484 --> 01:12:18,752
Yeah! We're on a boat.
We're on a boat headed up north on a river.

727
01:12:18,852 --> 01:12:22,768
- A boat? Where'd y'all get a boat?
- We met this, like, crazy Santa Claus...

728
01:12:22,868 --> 01:12:25,072
...time-traveler guy from World War II.
You'll meet him.

729
01:12:25,172 --> 01:12:26,374
What kind of boat y'all got?

730
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:29,844
It's more of, like, a plane than a boat,
really. Let's call it a "ploat."

731
01:12:30,048 --> 01:12:32,384
- We're on a ploat.
- We need their location, Slivko.

732
01:12:32,484 --> 01:12:34,924
Hey, send up a flare so we can find you.

733
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:39,494
Roger that, Fox Five. Fire in the hole!

734
01:12:44,145 --> 01:12:45,546
There!

735
01:12:45,646 --> 01:12:47,248
Yes!

736
01:12:47,348 --> 01:12:49,985
<i>I repeat, we have a visual.
Two klicks to our north.</i>

737
01:12:50,085 --> 01:12:52,923
Roger that, Fox Five. Fox One out.

738
01:12:53,822 --> 01:12:56,325
Rendezvous point, one hour.

739
01:12:56,425 --> 01:12:59,444
- Mount up!
- Can we fit everybody?

740
01:13:00,761 --> 01:13:03,911
Yes! We're going home!

741
01:13:10,139 --> 01:13:12,056
Get down!

742
01:13:21,749 --> 01:13:23,651
What the hell, man?

743
01:13:23,751 --> 01:13:28,411
He's gone. Everybody, grab your gear.
We have to keep moving.

744
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:32,661
- We'll go ashore, meet up with Packard.
- No. No. Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

745
01:13:32,761 --> 01:13:35,062
Is nobody gonna say anything about the...

746
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:38,847
He's gone! And he ain't coming back.
There's nothing to say.

747
01:13:41,902 --> 01:13:43,771
Oh, my God.

748
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:50,327
<i>Their flare was only two klicks north.</i>

749
01:13:51,245 --> 01:13:52,881
They should be here soon.

750
01:13:53,181 --> 01:13:56,599
Unless they were eaten
by something that's bigger than us.

751
01:14:03,442 --> 01:14:05,659
- Holy shit!
- Slivko!

752
01:14:08,663 --> 01:14:10,841
- I thought you were crazy.
- I wish I had been.

753
01:14:10,941 --> 01:14:13,982
- What's your count?
- What you see is what I got.

754
01:14:14,302 --> 01:14:17,304
- We lost one, too.
- Good to see you, fellas!

755
01:14:17,404 --> 01:14:20,206
- Who the hell is this?
- We picked up a hitchhiker.

756
01:14:20,306 --> 01:14:23,304
Lieutenant Hank Marlow of
the 45th Pursuit Squadron of the 15th.

757
01:14:23,404 --> 01:14:27,733
- You've been here since World War II?
- Yes, sir. I miss the parade?

758
01:14:28,549 --> 01:14:31,451
I'll be damned. Snap to, Lieutenant.

759
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:34,290
We're gonna get him home, sir.
If we follow this river...

760
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:36,624
...we'll make it to the boat, and we'll
make it to the north shore in time.

761
01:14:36,724 --> 01:14:38,493
That sounds good.

762
01:14:38,593 --> 01:14:42,257
But we're not leaving yet.
Still got a man out there, Conrad.

763
01:14:42,357 --> 01:14:44,736
- Wait a second. You got someone out there?
- Chapman.

764
01:14:44,836 --> 01:14:46,900
He's with the downed
Sea Stallion just west of here.

765
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,812
West? We can't go west!
That's where the skull things live.

766
01:14:50,912 --> 01:14:54,641
We have an old saying here. "East is best,
west is worst!" That's why we say it!

767
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:57,545
You know, southwest...
we could talk about that.

768
01:14:57,695 --> 01:15:00,714
But you're gonna need a lot
more guns if you're gonna go west.

769
01:15:00,814 --> 01:15:03,933
Guys. I think that we
should listen to Marlow.

770
01:15:04,784 --> 01:15:06,369
This is crazy.

771
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:12,114
Hey. Your job is finding lost men, right?

772
01:15:15,695 --> 01:15:16,741
Okay, sir.

773
01:15:16,841 --> 01:15:20,172
But if we reach that position and he's not
there, we don't send out a search party.

774
01:15:20,272 --> 01:15:22,302
We're back here by nightfall, understood?

775
01:15:22,402 --> 01:15:24,773
In 24 hours, we have to be
on the other side of this island.

776
01:15:24,873 --> 01:15:27,237
Roger that. Hear you loud and clear.

777
01:15:27,507 --> 01:15:30,477
All right, you heard the man.
Moving out in 10.

778
01:15:30,577 --> 01:15:34,198
This is a good group of boys.
We're all gonna die together out here.

779
01:15:34,298 --> 01:15:37,400
You're a good group of boys to die with,
I'll tell you that much.

780
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:40,369
You shouldn't have come here.

781
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:42,649
Don't forget to tell me this is a bad idea.

782
01:15:43,189 --> 01:15:45,377
This is a bad idea.

783
01:16:20,443 --> 01:16:23,896
Yeah, you smell that? That's death.

784
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:29,019
What the hell is this place?

785
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:31,442
This is what's left of Kong's parents.

786
01:16:31,542 --> 01:16:34,823
I've taken enough photos
of mass graves to recognize one.

787
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:37,390
The crash site's just
on the other side of this valley.

788
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,030
We'll cross through and make it
to the highest point west.

789
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:44,268
This place is a real no-no, sir.

790
01:16:44,368 --> 01:16:46,136
We need to be going
to the north side right now.

791
01:16:46,236 --> 01:16:48,938
And you're welcome to do that, my man.

792
01:16:49,038 --> 01:16:50,773
By yourself.

793
01:16:50,873 --> 01:16:53,009
I'm not leaving Jack out there.

794
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:54,992
Now, who's with me?

795
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:57,941
- We can make it.
- You're mighty right, we can make it.

796
01:16:58,041 --> 01:17:00,867
Now, stay sharp. Keep an eye out.

797
01:17:04,655 --> 01:17:07,874
I've only been here 28 years. What do I know?

798
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:43,442
Cole, we don't got time for that, man.
Put the cigarette out.

799
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:58,190
Watch those fumes!

800
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:00,926
Idiots.

801
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,430
Let's go. We gotta move!

802
01:18:14,514 --> 01:18:16,063
Run!

803
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:21,796
In here!

804
01:18:26,198 --> 01:18:27,752
Quiet.

805
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,794
I told you this damn place was a no-no.

806
01:18:55,846 --> 01:18:57,431
Damn it.

807
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:29,714
All right, let's move. Rally on me.

808
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:34,002
Rally up! Rally up!

809
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:36,921
Somebody cover the civilians' six.
Let's move!

810
01:19:50,184 --> 01:19:52,035
Oh, shit.

811
01:19:54,223 --> 01:19:55,772
Randa!

812
01:20:04,365 --> 01:20:06,116
Set up the 50!

813
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:56,468
Go!

814
01:21:17,603 --> 01:21:19,756
Bring the torch! Do your thing!

815
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:46,816
Slivko! Gas!

816
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:08,272
Marlow! Sword!

817
01:22:33,981 --> 01:22:36,021
Slivko, hang on!

818
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:44,592
This thing's moving!

819
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,057
Now, look, Colonel.

820
01:23:17,157 --> 01:23:19,092
You may outrank me...

821
01:23:19,492 --> 01:23:21,840
...but I've been here a hell of a lot longer.

822
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:27,101
And I'm telling you that thing that just
shredded us was only the first of them.

823
01:23:27,201 --> 01:23:31,638
Now we're on their turf,
and we need to turn back toot sweet!

824
01:23:31,738 --> 01:23:35,526
- Not as long as Chapman's still out there.
- I'm sorry, Colonel Packard.

825
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:38,327
Chapman is dead.

826
01:23:44,401 --> 01:23:47,805
Doesn't change a thing!
We're still going to that crash site.

827
01:23:47,905 --> 01:23:49,774
What's at that crash site
that you want so badly?

828
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:52,392
Weapons! Enough to kill it.

829
01:23:52,492 --> 01:23:55,882
- Kong didn't kill Chapman.
- But he did kill these men!

830
01:23:56,362 --> 01:23:59,997
- My men!
- You can't kill Kong, Colonel.

831
01:24:00,097 --> 01:24:03,294
Kong is god on this island. He's the
only thing keeping them lizard things...

832
01:24:03,394 --> 01:24:06,169
- ...in the ground.
- He's right, Colonel, we can't kill Kong.

833
01:24:06,269 --> 01:24:10,512
Now that other creature? That's the threat.
And there are more of them down there.

834
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:13,079
If you take away
a species' natural competition...

835
01:24:13,179 --> 01:24:15,815
- ...they'll proliferate out of control.
- Then we'll end them, too!

836
01:24:15,915 --> 01:24:18,184
After we bring this thing down.

837
01:24:18,284 --> 01:24:21,327
- I can't let you do that, Colonel.
- Wait! Hold your fire!

838
01:24:24,258 --> 01:24:27,026
This is one war we are not gonna lose.

839
01:24:27,126 --> 01:24:29,696
Nuts! You hear me? This is nuts!

840
01:24:29,796 --> 01:24:33,213
- Please! You need to listen to us!
- We're not at war. You're making a mistake.

841
01:24:33,313 --> 01:24:36,480
- Your lies got my men killed!
- And you're gonna get us all killed!

842
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:40,223
- Not our fight.
- Whose side are you on, Captain?

843
01:24:40,473 --> 01:24:45,579
Okay, Colonel. You'll find your
Sea Stallion three klicks up that ridge.

844
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:50,483
Now, I'm gonna take these civilians back
to the boat, and we'll wait for you there.

845
01:24:50,883 --> 01:24:52,701
All right?

846
01:25:06,999 --> 01:25:10,418
Saddle up! Let's go kill this thing!

847
01:25:15,716 --> 01:25:19,813
Steve, you running with the big dogs
or staying on the porch?

848
01:25:20,513 --> 01:25:22,121
I don't wanna be on the porch.

849
01:25:22,221 --> 01:25:24,166
Marlow, you okay?

850
01:25:24,716 --> 01:25:25,967
We need to stop him.

851
01:25:26,067 --> 01:25:29,375
You wanna talk with him about it again?
He seemed to really go for it the first time.

852
01:25:29,475 --> 01:25:31,059
He's losing his grip.

853
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:36,812
Now, follow me,
and we'll get off this rock alive.

854
01:25:41,599 --> 01:25:43,450
<i>Dear Billy...</i>

855
01:25:44,035 --> 01:25:46,854
<i>...I'm just trying to get home
to you and your mom.</i>

856
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:49,391
<i>You be strong, now.</i>

857
01:25:50,143 --> 01:25:51,994
<i>Much love.</i>

858
01:25:58,617 --> 01:26:01,055
Make sure those get back to his family.

859
01:26:02,055 --> 01:26:03,872
Dear Billy...

860
01:26:05,891 --> 01:26:08,510
...your dad was one of the best
to ever do it.

861
01:26:15,734 --> 01:26:17,602
There's water close by.

862
01:26:18,002 --> 01:26:20,655
Are you lost? Which way?

863
01:26:21,126 --> 01:26:22,974
Hang on.

864
01:26:35,387 --> 01:26:37,323
Wait here.

865
01:26:37,423 --> 01:26:40,141
I've got to get to higher ground
to find the river.

866
01:26:41,593 --> 01:26:44,197
Hey! I'm coming, too.

867
01:26:44,897 --> 01:26:46,779
I'll be right here.

868
01:26:48,934 --> 01:26:51,152
Keep your eyes open.

869
01:26:51,569 --> 01:26:53,705
Up in the trees, too.

870
01:26:53,805 --> 01:26:56,457
- Why?
- Ants.

871
01:26:57,042 --> 01:26:58,926
Big ones.

872
01:26:59,544 --> 01:27:01,428
There's one.

873
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,665
Sounds like a bird, but it's a fucking ant.

874
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:16,695
Gather up everything you can,
including those seismic charges.

875
01:27:16,795 --> 01:27:19,013
They got his attention the first time.

876
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:36,338
- This is a bad idea.
- Let's just get on with it.

877
01:27:36,948 --> 01:27:40,018
<i>Mills, Cole, let's prep this ordinance.</i>

878
01:27:40,118 --> 01:27:42,803
<i>Make him a special gift out of that napalm.</i>

879
01:28:13,518 --> 01:28:15,874
The boat must be around that bend.

880
01:30:08,431 --> 01:30:11,283
We have to go. Now.

881
01:30:41,964 --> 01:30:43,766
Don't shoot!

882
01:30:45,569 --> 01:30:49,360
- Conrad, which way are we going?
- You three need to go back to the boat.

883
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:52,210
It's that way. Wait for us till dawn.

884
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:54,575
If we're not back by then...

885
01:30:54,678 --> 01:30:57,048
- ...just go.
- You ain't gotta twist my arm.

886
01:30:57,348 --> 01:30:59,599
Where are you two going?

887
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:02,668
We're going to save Kong.

888
01:31:03,352 --> 01:31:05,737
Not without me, pal.

889
01:32:45,488 --> 01:32:47,322
Oh, dear.

890
01:33:10,713 --> 01:33:14,341
Men! Place your charges.

891
01:33:14,441 --> 01:33:16,169
It's time to show Kong...

892
01:33:16,419 --> 01:33:19,271
...that man is king!

893
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:23,391
- Arm one.
- Arm two.

894
01:33:23,491 --> 01:33:25,375
Arm three.

895
01:33:26,797 --> 01:33:28,313
Packard!

896
01:33:34,204 --> 01:33:36,088
Don't do it.

897
01:33:39,774 --> 01:33:42,051
I asked you fellas nice the first time.

898
01:33:42,478 --> 01:33:45,182
- We don't wanna fight here, Packard.
- This thing brought us down!

899
01:33:45,282 --> 01:33:47,949
- It killed my men!
- Kong was just defending his territory.

900
01:33:48,049 --> 01:33:51,207
We are soldiers! We do the dirty work...

901
01:33:51,307 --> 01:33:54,357
...so our families and our countrymen
don't have to be afraid!

902
01:33:54,457 --> 01:33:58,259
They shouldn't even know
a thing like this exists!

903
01:33:58,359 --> 01:34:00,411
You've lost your mind.

904
01:34:02,314 --> 01:34:04,156
Put that detonator down.

905
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:19,364
Stop!

906
01:34:22,817 --> 01:34:24,885
The world is bigger than this.

907
01:34:25,555 --> 01:34:29,798
Bitch, please! Slivko, get her out of there!

908
01:34:31,893 --> 01:34:34,539
You know it's the wrong thing to do, son.

909
01:34:51,612 --> 01:34:55,265
- Put it down, sir.
- Packard!

910
01:35:08,230 --> 01:35:10,064
Come on.

911
01:35:10,164 --> 01:35:11,999
It's over.

912
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:30,568
- That's the big one.
- Fall back.

913
01:35:33,455 --> 01:35:34,959
Go!

914
01:35:44,432 --> 01:35:46,016
Colonel.

915
01:35:46,968 --> 01:35:48,551
Sir!

916
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:11,540
Die, you mother...

917
01:36:28,517 --> 01:36:30,419
Kong's down. Let's go!

918
01:36:35,883 --> 01:36:37,703
- They told us to leave at dawn.
- I know.

919
01:36:37,803 --> 01:36:39,252
- It's dawn.
- I know!

920
01:36:39,352 --> 01:36:41,622
So what are we going to do?

921
01:36:54,635 --> 01:36:56,904
This is the edge of the island.

922
01:36:57,004 --> 01:37:00,308
Weaver, get up on those rocks
and fire a flare.

923
01:37:00,408 --> 01:37:02,050
With any luck, Brooks will see it.

924
01:37:05,079 --> 01:37:06,896
We'll buy you time.

925
01:37:08,713 --> 01:37:09,968
This way.

926
01:37:24,232 --> 01:37:27,051
Come on. Every second counts.

927
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:37,892
Cole! Come on, man, we gotta fall back.

928
01:37:37,992 --> 01:37:40,948
Go live your life. Get out of here.

929
01:37:43,818 --> 01:37:44,860
- Cole!
- Cole, no!

930
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,811
- Cole, no!
- Stop!

931
01:37:46,911 --> 01:37:49,190
Cole! Cole!

932
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:51,492
No! Don't!

933
01:37:51,592 --> 01:37:53,161
Cole!

934
01:37:53,961 --> 01:37:55,463
Cole!

935
01:38:01,202 --> 01:38:04,867
Come on. Come on. Son of a bitch.

936
01:38:30,201 --> 01:38:32,615
Come on! Go!

937
01:40:19,306 --> 01:40:21,589
Come on! Go!

938
01:40:23,476 --> 01:40:25,694
Come on! Hurry!

939
01:40:32,012 --> 01:40:33,885
Come on!

940
01:40:40,194 --> 01:40:43,679
- Marlow, a little help here!
- She's temperamental. Watch out!

941
01:41:32,879 --> 01:41:35,481
- Clear!
- Clear!

942
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:38,934
Come on, you bastard!

943
01:42:29,068 --> 01:42:30,452
Weaver!

944
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:22,713
Weaver? Weaver. Weaver. Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

945
01:44:26,185 --> 01:44:27,998
You're okay.

946
01:45:18,635 --> 01:45:20,437
So what do you think, fellas?

947
01:45:20,637 --> 01:45:22,489
This way to Key West?

948
01:45:23,375 --> 01:45:25,226
I think it is, brother.

949
01:45:26,343 --> 01:45:28,294
This place will change.

950
01:45:28,778 --> 01:45:30,629
Word will get out.

951
01:45:31,115 --> 01:45:32,883
It always does.

952
01:45:32,983 --> 01:45:35,202
Well, it's not coming from us.

953
01:45:39,689 --> 01:45:43,577
<i>We'll meet again</i>

954
01:45:44,562 --> 01:45:46,831
<i>Don't know where</i>

955
01:45:46,931 --> 01:45:49,913
<i>Don't know when</i>

956
01:45:50,013 --> 01:45:53,471
<i>But I know we'll meet again</i>

957
01:48:22,341 --> 01:48:25,153
<i>...here we go now
to the Cub half of number eight.</i>

958
01:48:25,253 --> 01:48:29,880
<i>If you want to see a crowd go crazy, see
what happens if this guy hits one right now.</i>

959
01:48:31,027 --> 01:48:33,086
<i>Fly ball, very deep.</i>

960
01:48:36,665 --> 01:48:41,120
<i>And the impossible dream
just became the possible dream!</i>

961
01:56:44,049 --> 01:56:46,133
<i>You just gonna sit there?</i>

962
01:56:48,140 --> 01:56:50,005
<i>In the dark.</i>

963
01:56:50,589 --> 01:56:52,591
<i>You're enjoying this, right?</i>

964
01:56:53,593 --> 01:56:55,675
Is this fun for you?

965
01:56:55,775 --> 01:56:59,164
- I promise I won't tell the Russians.
- I promise I will tell the Russians.

966
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:01,316
She's gonna tell the Russians.

967
01:57:08,474 --> 01:57:10,577
- Why are you keeping us here?
- I wanna go home.

968
01:57:10,677 --> 01:57:15,113
We get it. There was no island.
We were never on an island.

969
01:57:15,213 --> 01:57:17,413
Island? What island?

970
01:57:17,513 --> 01:57:21,040
- Brooks, what the hell is going on?
- Welcome to Monarch.

971
01:57:23,886 --> 01:57:26,322
This island is just the beginning.

972
01:57:26,422 --> 01:57:29,259
- There's more out there.
- What do you mean, "more"?

973
01:57:29,359 --> 01:57:32,708
This world never belonged to us.
It belonged to them.

974
01:57:32,808 --> 01:57:35,961
The question is how long
before they take it back.

975
01:57:37,532 --> 01:57:40,738
Kong... is not the only king.

976
01:57:41,305 --> 01:58:41,603
