2
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,932
Come on, let's find this guy.
I know he's here somewhere.

3
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,020
Come on, look for him. Just keep going.
We're gonna find him. I know it's here.

4
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,731
- There!
- Over to the right.

5
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,859
See over there? See anything?

6
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,404
- That's it.
- There it is!

7
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,199
That's it. All right!

8
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,788
- This is it.
- Let's rip this sucker open!

9
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,332
Gotta get a look at the main man.

10
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,795
Yee-haw!

11
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,717
Come on, dig. Deeper.

12
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:24,726
Come on, dig. Come on, let's dig.
Come on, faster. Dig.

13
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,399
Dig!

14
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,444
Let's just get all the dirt off
and let's pry it open. This is it.

15
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,995
Come on!

16
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,749
- Pry.
- Move it over here.

17
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,046
Harder. Come on.

18
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,929
- Come on, Neil!
- Unh. Okay, here it comes.

19
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,210
No. No.

20
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,224
No!

21
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,465
That must be the new kid.

22
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,530
Last stop, everybody out.

23
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,698
Tommy? Hey.

24
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:02,999
No? Beautiful. Sit there.
I don't give a shit.

25
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,795
Hey. How you doing?

26
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,882
Tommy Jarvis?
Hi, my name is Pam Roberts.

27
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,886
I'm the assistant director.
I'm glad you're here.

28
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:23,728
Well, if you'd like to grab your things,
I'll take you in to meet the doctor, okay?

29
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,402
Great.

30
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,989
Thank you.

31
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,493
Anytime, doll.

32
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,459
How was the ride?

33
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,088
Come on, Tommy.

34
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,593
You okay?

35
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,102
Come in.

36
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,230
Hi.

37
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:12,110
Hi, Tommy. I'm Matthew Letter.
Welcome to Pinehurst. Have a seat.

38
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,615
Sit down, son.

39
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,495
Uh, what I'm gonna do is tell you
a little about Pinehurst...

40
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:26,666
...and then we'll let you get settled
in your room. How does that sound?

41
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,379
Tommy?

42
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,424
How does that sound?

43
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,969
Sure.

44
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,852
All right. About Pinehurst...

45
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,938
...you'll find we're very different
from the state institution.

46
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,816
Uh, we don't have any guards here...

47
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,944
...nobody's gonna tell you what
you can do or what you can't do.

48
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:59,824
-Basically, you're your own boss.
-It's an honor system, Tommy.

49
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,162
What you're really doing here, Tommy...

50
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,917
...is preparing yourself to reenter
society and start a new life.

51
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,547
So, Pam, you wanna point Tommy
toward his room and get him started?

52
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:19,594
Sure. Okay? All right, you go
through the kitchen, up the stairs...

53
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:24,265
...and it's the first door on your left, okay?
I'll see you in a bit.

54
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,689
So, what do you think?

55
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,775
-The kid's a real talker.
-Heh.

56
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,153
I noticed. How'd they diagnose it?

57
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,781
Uh, "Severe trauma at age 12.

58
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,535
Brutal self-defense murder
of a psychopathic killer."

59
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,079
Boy, they've given him
every treatment...

60
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,914
...every therapy they can think of.

61
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,710
It's a wonder his mind isn't fried,
with all the drugs they've given him.

62
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,240
You scared of spiders?
You scared of rubber spiders?

63
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:11,998
You scared of rubber spiders on strings?
Man, you are one scared cat.

64
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:17,378
Where I come from,
you learn to be scared of nothing.

65
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,800
They call me Reggie the Reckless.
No spider would scare me.

66
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,053
Yo, man!

67
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,093
Don't.

68
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,137
You don't have to get all
twisted out of shape about it.

69
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,599
I mean, you act like you made
these things or something.

70
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,892
I did.

71
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,980
Solid.

72
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,192
So you're the new nut, huh?

73
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,030
-Is that what they call us?
-Us? I ain't one of you, man.

74
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,325
I'm just visiting.
My granddaddy works here.

75
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,165
Oh, gotta split.
Catch you later. There's action.

76
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,006
Joey, come on. Hurry up. Oh, my God!
Whoo!

77
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,260
Hey, you guys. Joey, come on.

78
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,183
Stop, come on. Don't!

79
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,686
-Come on, stop!
-Stay right here.

80
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,654
- Hey, Matt. How's it going?
- All right, sheriff. What's up?

81
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,449
Well, Matt, you know,
it's like we talked about.

82
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,660
You got some neighbors who aren't
too happy about your place here.

83
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:16,915
Now, I certainly know what it is you're
trying to do, and I respect it, Matt, I do.

84
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:22,378
But, well, we found a couple of your
kids on the Hubbard place again.

85
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,047
-Deputy!
-Yes, sir.

86
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,049
- Bring them out.
- Yes, sir.

87
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,344
Everybody out.

88
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,722
Cut out the fooling around.
Fall in by the sheriff.

89
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,849
-Yes, sir.
-Just get moving, wise guy.

90
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,233
We found them
in the Hubbards' woods.

91
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,903
They were screwing
their heads off, Matt.

92
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,615
Now, I think we're all pretty lucky this time,
because Ethel didn't see them.

93
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,867
I'll take care of it, sheriff.

94
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:05,296
-I'm gonna do the talking. You keep quiet.
-Morning, Ethel.

95
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,632
-My, don't you look lovely today.
-Horseshit!

96
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,093
Now, sheriff, you better hear me
and hear me good.

97
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,303
I want this loony bin closed down.

98
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,099
Do you hear me, fella? Now, these kids
ain't nothing but trouble!

99
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,811
They don't respect others' property
and they're all crazy!

100
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,439
-You tell them, Ma! Ha, ha.
-Ethel, these kids weren't doing....

101
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,775
Doing? Doing?

102
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,320
You think I don't know what those
two perverts were doing in my yard?

103
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:34,492
-Say it like you mean it, Ma!
-Would you shut the fuck up?

104
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,790
Now, I'm gonna tell all of you:

105
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:46,295
You mark my words, the next little
bastard comes near my farm...

106
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,966
...I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out.
You hear me?

107
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,136
Don't you come near me, sheriff.
I've warned you.

108
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,555
I got a bomb on me.
I swear to you!

109
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,142
You make one move toward me,
I'm gonna blow us all up.

110
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:04,355
Start the engines, Junior.
That's it. My final words.

111
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,111
Okay, people. Come on, let's go.
Party's over.

112
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,993
- Come on, you guys.
- We better go back inside.

113
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,998
-She's really something, ain't she?
-Jesus.

114
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,044
Seriously, Matt, I'd make an extra effort
to keep your kids off her property.

115
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,837
-I will.
-Now, listen, by the way...

116
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,339
...I understand
you got the Jarvis kid today.

117
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,676
-Yeah, he arrived a little while ago.
-And?

118
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,137
-And what?
-Well, what's he like?

119
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:40,183
He's like any other kid. He's just, uh....
He's been through a lot, that's all.

120
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:46,064
-Yeah. Well, good luck with him, pal.
-Thanks a lot, sheriff.

121
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,535
-Hi, girls.
-Hi, Joey.

122
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,537
-Hi, Violet.
-Huh?

123
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,580
-Hi!
-Yeah.

124
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,042
-What are you doing?
-Doing laundry, Joey.

125
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,254
Can I help? I'm really very good
at doing laundry.

126
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,798
Matt never assigns it to me,
I don't know why.

127
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,926
Look, Joey, we really have
to get this thing finished, okay?

128
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,720
So I'm here to help you.

129
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,307
You can count on me, Rob. You too, Vi.

130
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,144
Want a chocolate bar? Here, you want it?

131
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:10,148
-I'll give you half, but I need half for later.
-Piss off!

132
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,483
Oh, please let me help you.
It's really no problem....

133
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,821
-Joey! Will you just get out of here?
-Fuck!

134
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,909
I'm sorry, you two.
Really, I can do laundry great.

135
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,620
But, well, if that's how
you feel, forget it.

136
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:28,958
I'll just go help somebody else instead.
I'll see you later.

137
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,211
I can't believe this.

138
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,714
Listen, if you change your mind,
I'll be right around, okay?

139
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,966
-Joey!
-Joey.

140
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,760
Jesus, what a loser.

141
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,224
Look at this sheet.
I'm not gonna wash it. You wash it.

142
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,355
-Hi, Vic!
-Get lost.

143
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:56,110
Come on, don't be like that.
I'm gonna help you with the wood today.

144
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,198
And anyway, uh,
I got two chocolate bars, see?

145
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,452
-Don't tell the girls.
-Jeez, what an asshole.

146
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:12,668
You know, Vic, before I came here,
I never had anything to do...

147
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,171
...me being an orphan and all.

148
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,506
People always teased me
about sitting around...

149
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,926
...like some kind of pig or something.

150
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:26,015
But here it's different. I can help
others and do a lot of things.

151
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,143
You know something?
I really love it here.

152
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,230
I hate it.

153
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,692
You know, um, to be perfectly honest with
you, I never really chopped wood before...

154
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,403
...but it certainly looks like fun.

155
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,365
Leave me alone!

156
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,122
Here, Vic. Want a bite?

157
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,708
Here. I'll just put it over here...

158
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,961
...and later on, when you're hungry,
you can have it.

159
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:02,426
Well, if that's the way you feel,
forget it, Vic. Just forget it!

160
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,763
But I think you're really out of line.

161
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:29,787
Yeah, we got a homicide on our hands.
See what you got on a Faden.

162
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:35,042
Victor J. Faden. F-A-D-E-N.
Thanks, Harry.

163
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:43,467
- Shh. It's okay.
- Why?

164
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,728
Is there someone we should notify?

165
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,441
As far as I know,
there's no immediate family.

166
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,151
Mother died while giving birth...

167
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,405
...I don't know what the hell happened to the father.
Took off somewhere, I guess.

168
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:09,618
This kid got shuffled around from
home to home till he came here.

169
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,749
-He was a good kid.
-I know, Matt.

170
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,379
So, what do we got here?

171
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,677
Oh, God!

172
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,388
It's all right.

173
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,896
Bunch of pussies.

174
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,280
Come on, Roy. Get your hands dirty.

175
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,311
I'm telling you, Pete, this is bullshit!
This really sucks!

176
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,190
Just do it. Fix it, man! Those cunts
aren't gonna wait all night.

177
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,444
Oh, fuck! This is a mess.

178
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,244
No way, I refuse to do this.

179
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,663
You're the one who keeps
fucking around with this thing...

180
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,958
...so get off your ass and you fix it!

181
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,210
You understand?

182
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,212
Pete!

183
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:51,720
-You are an asshole!
-Aw, what's the matter, Vinnie?

184
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,222
You scared of the dark?

185
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,850
You all creeped out
by that murder at the nuthouse?

186
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,978
Oh, yeah, sure. Look, as far as
I'm concerned, all those loonies...

187
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:03,691
...should be killed off one by one.
Can you try it now?

188
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,738
Jesus, man! Can't you do anything?
Stop screwing around!

189
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:14,034
Get this done by the time I get back.
I gotta take a crap.

190
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:18,956
-Crap, my ass!
-Just do it, man! I mean it.

191
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,586
Fucking asshole!

192
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,134
Oh, you little fuck.

193
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,146
What are you doing, douche bag?

194
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,443
Enough already. You can stop.

195
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,155
Would you cut it out?

196
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,034
Pete!

197
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,717
All right, either you got the car
started or you're a dead man.

198
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,272
This ain't starting, man.
You fucked up again. It ain't starting.

199
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,483
I'm gonna kick your ass, kick your ass.

200
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,736
Come on, now.
Come on, everybody, this ain't starting.

201
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:16,615
Come on, motherfucker,
fix the fucking car.

202
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,952
Come on.
You fucked up again, you asshole.

203
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,663
What you doing up there, Vinnie?

204
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,171
Whoo! All right.
And we're off. Let's go!

205
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,987
<i>Die!</i>

206
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,116
<i>- Die!</i>
- Tommy!

207
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,411
<i>Die!</i>

208
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,246
<i>Tommy!</i>

209
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,915
<i>Die! Die!</i>

210
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:13,047
<i>Die! Die! Die!</i>

211
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,761
<i>Tommy!</i>

212
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,347
<i>Die!</i>

213
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,391
- Tommy!
<i>- Die!</i>

214
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,643
<i>Die!</i>

215
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,023
<i>Die! Die! Die!</i>

216
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,209
There you go.

217
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,133
- Gramps.
- What is it, son?

218
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,678
Can I go see my brother?
He'll be in town tomorrow.

219
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,306
We'll see.
You know how I feel about that.

220
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,935
-But, Gramps....
-I said, we'll see, Reggie.

221
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,653
Hey.

222
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,656
Come here, Reggie the Reckless.

223
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,835
Do me a favor. Don't kiss me
when there's people around, okay?

224
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:38,674
Oh. Okay, it's cool. Go on and let
everyone else know breakfast is ready.

225
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,596
Yo, breakfast! Come and get it!

226
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,933
I could've done that.

227
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,772
I, uh, miss Joey already.

228
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,691
So do I.

229
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,236
I hope Victor gets what's coming to him.

230
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,031
- Morning, everybody.
- Morning.

231
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,163
-Violet, you set too many places.
-Huh?

232
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,416
I said, you set too many places.

233
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,043
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

234
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:18,714
Don't think Victor and Joey
will be joining us this morning, Violet.

235
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,049
Heh, or any other morning.

236
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,928
-Reggie!
-Oh, God. I'm sorry.

237
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:31,101
You don't set a place for a dead person.

238
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,522
-I said I was sorry!
-What's going on here?

239
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:54,541
Look, I know how you all feel.

240
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:58,587
This thing is not easy for any of us.

241
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,257
So let's just have breakfast.

242
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,930
I'm sorry, Vi. I was out of line.

243
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,316
-Where's Eddie?
-He's upstairs.

244
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:24,655
Tommy, would you mind telling
Eddie to come downstairs?

245
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,747
Tommy? Would you mind?

246
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,961
Yeah, all right.

247
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,432
Asshole.

248
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,896
Relax, chief.
What's wrong, no sense of humor?

249
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,940
Can't you take a joke?

250
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:13,328
Just relax. Just relax. It's all right.
It's all right. It's gonna be all right.

251
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:18,208
Just relax. Yeah.
It's gonna be just fine.

252
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:30,512
I'm gonna chop you into itty-bitty
little pieces, my friend.

253
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,226
Just like they done to that piggo over
there at that fucking crazy farm, heh.

254
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,353
Ee-yah!

255
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,188
Ee-yah!

256
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:46,069
You big dildo. Eat your fucking slop.

257
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,657
Ain't I make the best goddamn stew
in the whole wide world?

258
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,118
Best goddamn stew
in the whole wide world, Mama.

259
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:59,499
It's that goddamn coyote,
gonna try to kill my lot again.

260
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:03,045
I'm gonna show that bastard
once and for all. You hear me, Junior?

261
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:13,013
Holy shit! Who the fuck are you
and what the fuck do you want?

262
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,808
Ma'am, I ain't eaten in two days.
I'd like to earn a meal.

263
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:21,897
-Yeah? What do you do?
-Whatever you need done.

264
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,777
Okay. Clean all the shit
out of the chicken coop...

265
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,737
...and dump it behind the shed.

266
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,991
You come back here when you got all the
shit out and then I'll fill your stomach.

267
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,162
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,464
That is one fucking ugly man
that goes there.

269
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:52,761
-That's one fucking ugly man, Mama.
-Would you shut your trap?

270
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,305
You know, you ain't so pretty
yourself, you know.

271
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,599
I ain't so pretty myself, I know.

272
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,065
Hi-yah!

273
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,193
I want every inch of this area
combed thoroughly.

274
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:12,030
Bring back anything you find.
Anything. Get going.

275
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,448
Yes, sir.

276
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,706
What the hell's going on here?

277
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,125
You talking to me, sheriff?

278
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,002
-Huh?
-Oh.

279
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,045
I thought you was talking to me.

280
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:32,175
No, Roy. It's okay.
Go ahead. Get them out of here.

281
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:46,606
Looks like we got us a maniac
on the loose, huh, sheriff?

282
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:08,879
Lana! Hey, Lana!

283
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,591
Sorry, buster. We're closed. Heh.

284
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,385
That's all right.
I just want a takeout order.

285
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,845
-You do, huh?
-Yeah.

286
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,346
Well, what would you like?

287
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,516
I would like Lana, to go,
with nothing on her.

288
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,351
Oh? And who wants her?

289
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,273
The pride of the
Unger Institute of Mental Health...

290
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,818
...who has just dumped his last bedpan
and would like very much to party.

291
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,779
Will you get your ass out here?

292
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:37,824
Lana? Hmm, I don't know about that.
I'll have to ask her.

293
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:41,828
Hey, Lana. You want Billy?
You sure?

294
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,581
She says she wants you too.

295
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,751
But you have to wait a few minutes
till she's done inside.

296
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,337
Yahoo!

297
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,468
There. I'm going to party.

298
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,024
It's showtime. Ha, ha.

299
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,907
That's it.

300
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:26,540
That's it. That's the whole
fucking thing right there.

301
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,294
There it is.
You just stay right there, doll.

302
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,756
That's just what the doctor ordered.

303
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,425
Nothing like a little
preventive medicine.

304
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:41,680
And the forecast is
cloudy in the mountains...

305
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:46,268
...sunny in the valleys
and snow flurries up your nose.

306
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,284
Mm.

307
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,246
<i>I don't know if he loves me</i>

308
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,623
<i>But I think he does</i>

309
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,341
Billy?

310
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,571
Girl, you are so hot.

311
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,553
Hey, Lana!

312
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,225
What the fuck is she doing?

313
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,228
Hey!

314
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,982
Jesus Christ! Come on, will you?

315
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,901
Lana!

316
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,529
Hey! Hey!

317
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,873
You bad kitty. You bad kitty.

318
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:33,191
That isn't nice. I don't
like you anymore.

319
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:37,879
You bad kitty. I feed you, I love you
and you scare me like that.

320
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,299
Go on, kitty.

321
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,679
Sorry, heh.

322
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,267
Billy?

323
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,235
Billy, what are you doing? It's cold.

324
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:14,916
This is cute. I like this. A whole lot.

325
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,596
You're gonna waste a lot of money
this way, smarty.

326
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,516
Oh, well, that just means more for me.

327
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,476
Oh.

328
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,313
Mm, yummy.

329
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,569
Oh, my God. Billy? Billy!

330
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,397
I don't care if you have to put
your fucking mother behind bars!

331
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:04,818
Get me the goddamn psycho
who's responsible for this mess.

332
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:10,407
I mean, shit, Tucker,
what the hell's going on here?

333
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,451
I mean, this is a small town, man.

334
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:17,747
And small towns are supposed to be safe.

335
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,756
I know who it is.

336
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:33,972
-What?
-I said, I know who it is.

337
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,477
-Who?
-It's Jason Voorhees.

338
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,857
Jason Voorhees?

339
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,861
You're out of your fucking mind!
You've been out in the sun too long.

340
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,904
Jason Voorhees is dead!

341
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:54,117
His body was cremated.
He's nothing but a handful of ash.

342
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,036
You know that for sure, mayor?

343
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,122
Were you there?
Did you see him cremated?

344
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,874
-Jason Voorhees.
-Yes.

345
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,750
I can't believe this!

346
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:07,589
Here. This is your Jason Voorhees here.

347
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,799
This.

348
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:19,058
Your ass is on the line here, Tucker.
Are you getting that?

349
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,937
You get me a goddamn live suspect.

350
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:47,003
-You fuck! You really scared me.
-You loved it.

351
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:53,551
-You want more?
-Eddie, we can't.

352
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,596
-Matt'll kill us.
-Fuck him.

353
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:02,644
-Fuck you.
-Exactly. Fuck me.

354
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,021
Come on, Tina.

355
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,399
Come on. Come on.

356
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,707
Come on.

357
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,295
Watch the dirt. Watch the dirt.

358
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,570
-What?
-Wait. Wait a minute.

359
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,489
Especially for the occasion.

360
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:04,724
-I gotta go wash up.
-Okay, sugar.

361
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,444
-Hurry back.
-I'm hurrying.

362
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,995
I'm back.

363
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,041
What is this? Sleeping? Hey.

364
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,788
Let's get this show on the road!

365
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,457
Wait a minute, Reggie, I'm coming.

366
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,917
I just don't understand it.

367
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,630
Now, Reggie,
I want you to be a good kid with Pam.

368
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,801
-She's doing us both a great favor.
-Yeah, if she ever gets here.

369
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,720
And don't go getting in any trouble
with Demon, you hear?

370
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:51,641
All right, all right. Yo, Pam, come on!

371
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,269
Tina and Eddie are gonna show up
the minute they get hungry...

372
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,396
...so stop worrying.

373
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,441
I'm not worried anymore,
I'm just pissed.

374
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,984
Well, stop it.

375
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,160
Look, why don't you take Tommy
with you?

376
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,163
Probably do him good
to get him out of here for a while.

377
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,624
Yeah, that's a good idea.

378
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:20,711
Tommy? Pam's taking Reggie
to see his brother tonight.

379
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:24,799
-Why don't you ride along with them?
-Yeah, great idea. Now, let's go.

380
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,304
Why don't you go see
what you can do, huh?

381
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,056
Okay.

382
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,392
Tommy.

383
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,479
Tommy.

384
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,693
Come on. It'll be fun.

385
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,156
Okay?

386
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,369
Good.

387
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,978
-Come on.
-No. I'll wait here.

388
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,648
-Come on.
-I'm okay.

389
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,235
Yo, Demon!

390
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,613
That the big bad
wolf rapping at my door?

391
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,490
Yeah, bro, it's me, it's me. Open up!

392
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,368
- That you, Reckless?
- Open up the door!

393
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,957
Oh, my God.
Well, get your ass in here, boy!

394
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:25,127
God, it's good to see you, dude.
Damn, you look good!

395
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,004
I know, I know. Heh.

396
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:31,384
Oh, God. Look at this. God.
Hey, you had any dinner?

397
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:35,054
Here. Have an enchilada. Man.

398
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,682
Wow, man, where'd you get
those bad rings from?

399
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:41,686
If you been around the world as long
as your big brother have, you get things.

400
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,774
Freaking-A! Where'd you get that?

401
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,776
Hey, calm down, dude.

402
00:49:49,802 --> 00:49:52,179
Hey, say hello to Anita.
She's my girlfriend.

403
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,385
Hello, beautiful.

404
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:56,350
Hey, little brother.
What's happening? Heh.

405
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,120
Listen, I want you all to meet somebody.

406
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:02,248
Hey, Pam.
Yo, Pam, come here, baby, come here.

407
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,166
-This is my friend, Pam.
-Hi.

408
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,502
She's my girlfriend.

409
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,714
What's up, Pam?

410
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,020
-Pam, you hungry?
-Oh, no, thanks.

411
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,689
You want a taco? Egg roll?
What about a slice of pizza?

412
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,191
-No, thank you.
-Cheese and sausage.

413
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,444
What about you, brother?
I know what you want.

414
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,112
-Want a beer?
-Yeah, I'll take--

415
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,488
-Get out of here.
-Heh.

416
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:38,075
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you take this?

417
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,785
Wow.

418
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,370
Hey, man, this is bad!

419
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,206
Nothing is too good for
my little brother.

420
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,958
You gonna give me this too?

421
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:32,129
I got you, didn't I?
Really scared you, didn't I?

422
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,257
Are you dumb or something?

423
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,891
You a crazy from the loony bin!

424
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:51,440
Oh, my mama's gonna chop you up
into itty-bitty pieces, my friend!

425
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:56,445
You hear me? I said, are you hearing me?

426
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,449
I said, are you hearing me?

427
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,578
You fucking lunatic!

428
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,649
Tommy!

429
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,787
Reggie, we've gotta go now.

430
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,957
-It's okay, bro. Take care, all right?
-Thanks for the dinner.

431
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,042
-Anytime.
-Stay cool, baby.

432
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:56,505
- Hey, stay safe, Reckless.
- I will.

433
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:11,270
-You know, I miss him already.
-Yeah, he's a cutie-pie.

434
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,230
-Wanna hit this?
-Yeah.

435
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,233
What's wrong?

436
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:21,697
-Hey, you okay?
-Ooh. It's them damn enchiladas.

437
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,326
You gonna be all right?

438
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,230
Who's that?

439
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,858
Stop it!

440
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,611
Stop it!

441
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,454
You gonna get it, bitch!

442
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:15,251
Oh, lighten up, Demon. You'll feel
a lot better after you shit. Heh.

443
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:19,672
I'll feel a lot better when I'm out of here.
This shit box is gross!

444
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,675
You better watch out for the snake
that's gonna crawl up that crapper...

445
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:25,135
...and bite your ass, heh.

446
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,225
<i>Ooh, baby</i>

447
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,935
<i>Hey, baby</i>

448
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,187
<i>Hey, baby</i>

449
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,314
<i>Ooh, baby</i>

450
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,359
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh, baby</i>

451
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,279
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh, baby</i>

452
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,406
<i>Hey, baby</i>

453
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:46,907
<i>Hey, baby</i>

454
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,910
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh, baby</i>

455
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,913
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh, baby</i>

456
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,415
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh--</i>

457
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:02,089
Anita? Hey, girl, what's up?

458
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,183
Hey!

459
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,979
Okay. I told you this isn't funny.

460
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,190
Now you gonna get it, bitch.

461
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,285
Anita!

462
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,464
Matt's gone. George too.

463
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,841
- Are you sure?
- I looked everywhere.

464
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,677
And Tina and Eddie
haven't come back either.

465
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:35,265
-Where are they?
-Look, it's okay. Calm down, Jake.

466
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:39,395
Let's try to take this slowly.
Where did Matt say he was going?

467
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,189
- He didn't.
- Yes, he did.

468
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,525
He said he was gonna go look
for Tina and Eddie.

469
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,778
Where's Tommy?
I thought he was with you.

470
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,989
-And where's Gramps?
-I don't know, Reggie.

471
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:56,078
Look, why don't you all go inside?
I'm gonna go find everyone.

472
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,540
-Jake, I'm putting you in charge.
-Yes.

473
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,752
And you, little Reckless,
I want you in bed asleep...

474
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,921
...by the time I get back, right?

475
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,631
No problem.

476
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,716
Okay.

477
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:43,417
I'm making your dinner, Junior!
You hearing me, fella?

478
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:47,421
He hurt me, Ma! Do you hear me?
They hurt me!

479
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,805
I am making your dinner!

480
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:19,203
They hurt me, Ma!
Will you murder them?

481
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:24,541
Chop them and kill them! You hear me?

482
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,753
Are you hearing me, boy?
Get off that fucking bike...

483
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,838
...and come here and eat my stew!

484
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,813
About time, you fuckwad.

485
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:52,736
Knew you couldn't pass up on my stew.

486
00:58:56,616 --> 00:59:03,205
You hearing me, Junior?
You talk. You dumb?

487
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,496
<i>It's so lonely here.</i>

488
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,334
<i>Like we were the only two people left</i>
<i>in the whole world.</i>

489
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,129
<i>Maybe we are.</i>

490
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,883
<i>Maybe when we get back to shore,</i>
<i>everybody else will have disappeared.</i>

491
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,677
<i>I'd like that. Wouldn't you?</i>

492
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,313
Robin. Ahem.

493
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:58,487
We've been here
nearly eight months now, right?

494
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,072
Uh-huh.

495
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:05,619
That's a long time to get to know
somebody, don't you think?

496
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:06,828
Shh.

497
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,748
-Jake, please.
-Sure, sure.

498
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,586
<i>We could go
anywhere we wanted...</i>

499
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:18,131
<i>...and we could live</i>
<i>in the biggest house in the world.</i>

500
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,506
<i>Only, I'd like to live
in a little house.</i>

501
01:01:21,532 --> 01:01:24,204
<i>Just big enough for
the two of us.</i>

502
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,727
<i>Only, there's gonna be</i>
<i>more than two of us, isn't there?</i>

503
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,197
I like you, Robin.

504
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:46,952
-A lot.
-And I like you too, Jake.

505
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:51,581
You do? A lot?

506
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,085
What are you talking about,
Jake?

507
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,753
Uh....

508
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,052
I wanna be with you.

509
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:09,266
I really do wanna be with you.

510
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:16,231
I wanna make love with you.

511
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,953
-I can't....
-I didn't mean it.

512
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,457
I didn't mean it.

513
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:40,756
I said, I-- I didn't mean it!

514
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,959
Vi?

515
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,256
Vi!

516
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:31,556
-Vi, I'd like to talk to you.
-Huh?

517
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:36,061
-I need to talk to you.
-Can it wait?

518
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,776
No.

519
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:20,146
Reggie. Reggie? Come on.
Reggie, wake up.

520
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,024
- Mm.
- Come on, it's time to go to bed.

521
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,776
Reggie, wake up. Reggie!

522
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,076
Okay, your way.

523
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,582
Jake, I'm sorry.

524
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:25,795
You know, sometimes, Robin,
you are just so stupid.

525
01:06:56,387 --> 01:07:01,516
<i>There was a man so cold</i>
<i>No life was in his eyes</i>

526
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:08,857
<i>He had a look so hard</i>
<i>I'd never seen him smile</i>

527
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,697
<i>I could've told you then</i>
<i>You'd heard it all before</i>

528
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:22,537
<i>And now you're in suspense</i>
<i>You have to wait for more</i>

529
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:29,711
<i>In all those mysteries</i>
<i>You're taken by surprise</i>

530
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:36,760
<i>You never thought to see</i>
<i>That look was in his eyes</i>

531
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:42,682
<i>There's a man with no
life in his eyes</i>

532
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,647
<i>There's a man with no
life in his eyes</i>

533
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:24,724
What are them nuts up to now?

534
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:58,758
Yo, Tommy. You back?
Tommy, you in here?

535
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,765
Yo, Tommy.

536
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:25,702
What is it, Reggie? It's Pam.
What's the matter? What's the matter?

537
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:31,166
-It's me. What is it? What is it?
-In Tommy's room.

538
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:37,130
Okay. All right. You stay here.
Relax. I'll be right back. Okay?

539
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,073
Move!

540
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,702
-Aah!
-Get up! Get up!

541
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,596
Shit!

542
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:33,061
Run! Come on! Let's go!

543
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,013
Help us!

544
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:43,298
Reggie! Reggie!

545
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,782
Pam, where are you?

546
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,496
-Pam!
-Reggie!

547
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,125
Reggie!

548
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:50,365
Reggie! Reggie!

549
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:03,044
Reggie.

550
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:46,754
No! No!

551
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,471
No!

552
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,400
Oh, it's okay, Reggie.
It's okay. It's okay.

553
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,126
God.

554
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,470
Oh, God.

555
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:03,993
Yeah! All right, Pam!

556
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,300
Yeah!

557
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:03,511
Tommy! Tommy!

558
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,741
Run, Tommy, run!

559
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:29,370
Run! He'll kill you!

560
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:32,039
- Jason?
- Listen to me!

561
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:35,209
Run! Go! Tommy, get out!

562
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:36,794
- Jason?
- Get out!

563
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:40,172
Listen! Oh, Tommy, go!

564
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,051
Please, Tommy!

565
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:47,930
- Tommy!
- Remember.

566
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:50,599
Don't.

567
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:55,980
- Remember.
- Die!

568
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:58,691
- Remember.
- Die!

569
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,569
- Jason.
<i>- Remember, remember.</i>

570
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:06,115
<i>- Remember, remember, remember....</i>
- Tommy! Tommy!

571
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,264
Up here, Tommy! Come on! Up here!

572
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,641
Come on! Come on.

573
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:35,603
- Tommy, please!
- Come on, Tommy, up here!

574
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:39,315
- Come on!
- Come on, hurry up!

575
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:41,150
Tommy, hurry up!

576
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,194
Come on, come on.

577
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:46,489
Come on, Tommy, you can do it!
Come on, Tommy!

578
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:49,909
- Tommy, please!
- Tommy, hurry up!

579
01:19:50,076 --> 01:19:52,453
Take my hand. Take my hand!

580
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,455
Come on, yeah.

581
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,583
- Come on, yeah.
- Just one more, Tommy. Come on.

582
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,674
Come on, you can do it!

583
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:55,159
No!

584
01:22:16,222 --> 01:22:19,934
Pam! No! Please help me!

585
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,942
Please! Please, somebody help me! Pam!

586
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:31,737
Help! Help!

587
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:35,324
Help! Help! Please, help!

588
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,527
How are you doing?

589
01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:13,213
Quite a kid.

590
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,344
We found this on Roy.

591
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:24,308
The kid who was axed to death
at the woodpile was Roy's son.

592
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:30,981
God only knows why Roy kept it
hidden all these years, but he did.

593
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:33,901
Roy was a real loner.

594
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:39,990
Never talked much,
not even to the other paramedics.

595
01:24:43,703 --> 01:24:45,621
I guess when
he was called to the scene...

596
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:49,333
...and he saw that it was his own Joey,
all hacked to pieces....

597
01:24:50,668 --> 01:24:52,753
Oh, God.

598
01:24:55,381 --> 01:24:57,633
We also found these.

599
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,933
I guess he used the Jason thing...

600
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:08,602
...to cover up with.

601
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:04,825
Tommy.

602
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:23,760
Hi.

603
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:57,539
Oh, my God.

604
01:28:58,305 --> 01:29:58,439
