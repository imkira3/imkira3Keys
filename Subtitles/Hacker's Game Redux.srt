00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:37,978
My name is Soyan Swartz
and I am an internet activist.

4
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,646
I have infiltrated
the IT systems

5
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:43,817
of numerous government agencies
and corporations.

6
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,818
Over the years,
I have sought out to expose

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,589
classified information.

8
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,960
Today I found something that
requires immediate disclosure.

9
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:58,898
<i>Today, many companies are trying
to rewrite our history</i>

10
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,668
<i>and alter the truth.</i>

11
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:02,768
<i>As Mao, Lenin, and others</i>

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,804
<i>used propaganda
for political goals,</i>

13
00:01:04,806 --> 00:01:08,276
<i>corporations now control images
for commercial purposes.</i>

14
00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:10,776
<i>We are on the verge
of a new world</i>

15
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:12,746
<i>where the objective facts...</i>

16
00:01:24,225 --> 00:01:26,459
<i>They have the power
to control</i>

17
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,127
<i>the minds of the innocent.</i>

18
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,862
<i>They have the power
to make the innocent guilty</i>

19
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:31,430
<i>and the guilty innocent,</i>

20
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:34,869
<i>as they control the minds
of the masses.</i>

21
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,352
<i>Corporations
now control images</i>

22
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:55,089
<i>for commercial purposes.</i>

23
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,861
<i>The media is the most powerful
entity in the world.</i>

24
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:01,927
<i>They have the power to make
the innocent guilty,</i>

25
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:03,597
<i>and the guilty innocent.</i>

26
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,499
And that's power
because they control

27
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,136
the minds of the masses.

28
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:15,109
My name is Soyan Swartz,
and I wish you all good luck.

29
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:38,888
<i>TB8-XA5.</i>

30
00:04:40,222 --> 00:04:42,725
<i>RXF7.</i>

31
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:47,127
<i>Abandon. Karpov versus Kasparov.</i>

32
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:50,631
<i>World Championship match, 1990.</i>

33
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:55,171
<i>Move 44, white wins.</i>

34
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:03,711
He's late.

35
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:05,012
Russel, are you still sure

36
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,681
you want to go through
with this?

37
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:10,086
We've been through this.
Don't be such a lawyer.

38
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:14,290
It's part of the game.
Keep your enemies closer.

39
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,064
Here he is.

40
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,938
I'm Lena Leiboviz.

41
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:31,374
This is my partner,
Russel Belial.

42
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:33,343
Our lawyer, Cliff Brown.

43
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:40,050
We asked you
in here today because...

44
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:43,954
Well, recently, something very
serious happened at our company.

45
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:47,221
Uh, most of our clients register
for our services online.

46
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:49,557
So you can imagine our surprise
Friday morning

47
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:50,858
when our server crashed

48
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,696
after millions
of new users registered.

49
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:55,398
We know it was a hack.

50
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,531
We assume it was just some kids

51
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:59,001
trying to make
a name for themselves

52
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:00,368
in the hacking community.

53
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,970
But whatever
their motivations were,

54
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:03,939
there were
very real consequences.

55
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:05,741
NASDAQ had to freeze
our listing.

56
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:06,808
Our stocks plummeted.

57
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,612
Until we sorted out the problem.

58
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:12,346
We lost a few big clients,
that's what happened.

59
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:14,851
All because a few kids wanted
to have some fun.

60
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:19,790
Good thing is, when someone
hacks a system,

61
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,525
there's always the possibility
of getting caught.

62
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:24,826
And you know how DAs
like to make

63
00:06:24,828 --> 00:06:26,830
an example
out of some stupid kid.

64
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:30,966
Especially if they connect a bus
to National Security issues.

65
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:33,971
We found a few IP addresses
and traced them.

66
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:36,406
So, hopefully, that's how
we'll get our guy.

67
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:39,206
We know.

68
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,012
And you've got some balls coming
in here for an interview

69
00:06:42,245 --> 00:06:43,945
after doing what you've done.

70
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:45,816
I'm not even gonna ask why.

71
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:49,887
Instead, I'm gonna ask you
the million dollar question.

72
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:53,855
How would you like to go to work
for us?

73
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:55,927
You already know our system.

74
00:06:56,326 --> 00:07:00,162
We represent a lot
of high-profile clients here.

75
00:07:00,164 --> 00:07:04,298
News databases,
social networks, banks,

76
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,135
they rely on us
to create new identities.

77
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:08,872
Change facts...

78
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:11,642
rewrite history, so to speak.

79
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:13,442
We need a risk taker,

80
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:16,313
someone who can break into
other systems.

81
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:18,213
We need an answer,

82
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:21,285
and we need it here
at this table right now.

83
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:25,889
Great.

84
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,858
I'll take that as a yes.

85
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,395
We'll deal with
the formalities later.

86
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,944
Here are a few photos
of the victims.

87
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:22,981
You can match them

88
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,751
with photographs
and online videos

89
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:31,856
through, what do you call...
facial recognition software.

90
00:08:32,357 --> 00:08:38,627
We will then create positive IDs
with names, addresses,

91
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:40,731
create a master list.

92
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,467
How many people
are there?

93
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:45,937
- This will take weeks.
- I know.

94
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:47,703
We don't have everything.

95
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:49,172
Who else has access to this?

96
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:50,809
No one, just you and me.

97
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:52,710
Why, is something wrong?

98
00:08:53,444 --> 00:08:55,378
How do you make any money
with this?

99
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,083
I still have
a donor or two left.

100
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:01,552
- But I'm taking a lot of heat.
- From who?

101
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:06,956
From someone who knows how
to pick the locks of my office.

102
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,693
They cut the brakes of my car.

103
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:17,134
I'll call you.

104
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:28,680
<i>Hey, sis.</i>

105
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:30,782
I've tried calling you
100 times.

106
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:33,217
- <i>How've you been?</i>
- Fine.

107
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,984
<i>Still in New York?</i>

108
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:39,122
I don't know how people can pay
rent here. It's so expensive.

109
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:40,525
You need money?

110
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,263
Well, you know, it's been hard.

111
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:50,001
I want to see you.

112
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,138
Why don't you ever call me?

113
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:57,642
I'll call if anything
comes up, okay?

114
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:25,302
<i>Oh, it's an uppercut!</i>

115
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:27,070
<i>That lands hard
to the side of the face.</i>

116
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:30,507
<i>Our challenger is reeling,
trying to find her footing.</i>

117
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:32,643
<i>Oh, they've tied up
the center of the ring.</i>

118
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:35,613
<i>Now, here's a jab.
Here's a combination.</i>

119
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:53,265
Sorry.

120
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:57,670
I was writing the code
for the firewall.

121
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:58,902
Mm-hm.

122
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:04,542
Okay, shall we?

123
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,611
This is TEECO, Fortune 500.

124
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:11,083
CEO John Chester just died
at the age of 87.

125
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:14,685
His son, James,
is set to inherit his job.

126
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:17,188
Problem was,
Junior was a pussy hound.

127
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,458
He met his wife in a strip club.

128
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,392
The wife is the problem.

129
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:23,061
We discovered that in the '90s

130
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:24,828
she made a number
of soft-core films

131
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,098
under the name Bella Blue.

132
00:11:27,032 --> 00:11:30,534
Jump to 2000,
fell completely off the grid.

133
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:34,506
Got plastic surgery and became
Mrs. James Chester.

134
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:37,808
Now they have three kids,
host political fundraisers,

135
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,479
and sit on the board
of several major charities.

136
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:43,316
So who wants us
to clean up their past?

137
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:44,683
TEECO.

138
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:47,286
The board of directors
is naturally concerned.

139
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:50,856
They don't want bad press
to get out on either of them.

140
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:55,460
Let's see.
I can offline Chester Junior's.

141
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:58,597
But her,
she's still got some fan pages.

142
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:01,101
Let's see.

143
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:06,473
Is that her?

144
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:10,775
Yes, that's her.

145
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:14,146
We're gonna need
a good backstory for this one.

146
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:18,884
Let's kill her off.

147
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,688
We start a rumor online that...

148
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:25,425
Bella Blue dies in a car crash.

149
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:29,029
Suicide, whatever.
Plant some articles.

150
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:31,331
Fabricate some photos.

151
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:34,632
Build a paper trail
for Mrs. Chester Junior.

152
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:38,269
Two names,
two different identities.

153
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,938
And we kill off the bad one.

154
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:41,307
I kind of like it.

155
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:43,076
What about everything in print?

156
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:45,410
Paper will pick it up
and put it on their website.

157
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:47,211
It'll go round and round
from there.

158
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:48,547
What do you think, Lena?

159
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:51,616
Let's do it. Pull the trigger.

160
00:12:51,618 --> 00:12:53,651
The company has booked you
a hotel suite

161
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,356
so you can work at your leisure.

162
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,724
I'll be by later
to check on things.

163
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,460
You have two weeks.

164
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:14,374
Soyan, do me a favor.

165
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:17,175
Don't be late again.

166
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:34,487
<i>Arms dealer
Vanderbilt was arrested,</i>

167
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:37,090
<i>then released
after only a few hours.</i>

168
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:38,756
<i>He has been identified</i>

169
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:40,392
<i>by the International
Criminal Court</i>

170
00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:43,661
<i>as a person of interest
in violating the embargo.</i>

171
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:45,464
<i>Over the last 20 years,</i>

172
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:46,999
<i>Vanderbilt has built</i>

173
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:50,169
<i>one of the most powerful
arms fortunes in Europe,</i>

174
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:53,438
<i>and also may be responsible
for countless deaths</i>

175
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,309
<i>through illegal
weapons trafficking.</i>

176
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:57,410
<i>Technology shares
have plunged</i>

177
00:14:57,412 --> 00:15:00,345
<i>after a cyberattack
shut down several networks</i>

178
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:01,746
<i>in southeast Asia</i>

179
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:03,415
<i>yesterday afternoon.</i>

180
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,617
<i>No one has claimed
responsibility for the attack,</i>

181
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:07,186
<i>but sources indicate the virus</i>

182
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:10,355
<i>may have originated
from servers in China.</i>

183
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,192
<i>Though the U.N. and Arab...</i>

184
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:14,695
I heard the news.

185
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:18,999
No, it's not over for me.

186
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:21,802
Let's talk tomorrow.

187
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:11,018
- I haven't finished.
- Finished what?

188
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:13,018
We lost our guy.

189
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,756
Even if we kept our last donor,
I'd still lose the case.

190
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:17,490
They're too strong.

191
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:19,427
Do you understand?
I can't pay you anymore.

192
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:20,892
Don't worry,

193
00:16:20,894 --> 00:16:22,330
- you can pay me later.
- Loise...

194
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:25,600
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't!

195
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,741
I'll call you, okay?

196
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:37,878
Yes? No, this isn't
a good time to talk.

197
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:40,879
Uh, I'd rather meet you
in person.

198
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:43,618
Okay, I'll text you the address,
and I'll see you then.

199
00:16:44,352 --> 00:16:45,986
Perfect.

200
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:48,789
Hey, come on in.

201
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,466
What's the matter, champ?
You don't look so hot.

202
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:01,066
Uh, I have inner ear problems.

203
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:02,100
Cars make me dizzy.

204
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:03,971
Oh, sit over here.
It'll help.

205
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:12,078
For our next magic trick,

206
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,781
we're moving on
to bigger, better things.

207
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,050
Pull out your laptop.

208
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,217
Had a conference call yesterday
with some arms dealers.

209
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:20,489
They sold their product
to the wrong side.

210
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:23,256
There was an embargo,
and now they're in trouble.

211
00:17:23,258 --> 00:17:25,792
They are the clients,
here's the front company,

212
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,862
here's the main company,
and then this one.

213
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:30,530
She's the lawyer.

214
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:31,898
She filed a complaint

215
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,968
with the International
Criminal Court.

216
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,838
But they tried to sideline her.

217
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:38,641
Man, she is stubborn.

218
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:41,709
Anyway, I arranged
a meeting with her for tomorrow,

219
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:44,678
a job interview,
I'm gonna throw her off trail.

220
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,914
Gently.

221
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,016
What do you want me to do?

222
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,953
Tell them they were there
to hand out food, medicine.

223
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:53,288
The usual.

224
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:55,188
And we also need to erase

225
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,026
that bank transfer
to the Cayman Islands.

226
00:17:58,426 --> 00:17:59,562
This lawyer traced it.

227
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:01,795
I don't know how the hell
she figured it out,

228
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:03,766
but I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it.

229
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:06,635
Driver, stop here.

230
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:09,939
You know
what kind of story I like.

231
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:13,074
Just make them look like
the good guys.

232
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:15,310
I'll be back in a minute.

233
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:32,595
Hey, the door was open.

234
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:34,896
My door is always open.

235
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:38,331
- I brought your stuff back.
- Look at you.

236
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,234
Hey.

237
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,875
I haven't read this one.

238
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,375
May I?.

239
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:56,653
Coffee?

240
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:13,769
Life sucks.

241
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,338
My boss is broke.

242
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:19,975
My sister is dealing
with money issues.

243
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,111
Still no news about him?

244
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:26,181
No.

245
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,751
I probably
wouldn't recognize him

246
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,189
if I tripped over him
on the street.

247
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,226
I searched for him.

248
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:41,063
It's over.

249
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,330
Well,
you know that's not the case.

250
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:44,967
It's part of you.

251
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:50,039
And there's always a chance
for good news.

252
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,175
I don't know.

253
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,181
So, how about you?
The undercover gonzo journalist?

254
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:03,651
Um, well,
I'm putting finishing touches

255
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,185
on my book about this hedge fund

256
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:06,688
that dabbled in the drug trade.

257
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,556
I'm gonna call it
<i>Powder Brokers</i>

258
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,225
or <i>A Wall of Powder.</i>

259
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:12,693
- I haven't decided yet.
- Sounds like Pulitzer material.

260
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:16,098
Oh, no,
I'm not getting that.

261
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,772
You're my only friend.

262
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:29,145
Gotta run.

263
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:48,030
Good, you're here.
Come in, look at this.

264
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,267
<i>James Chester, Junior</i>

265
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:54,838
<i>has just been appointed
CEO of TEECO,</i>

266
00:20:55,305 --> 00:20:58,408
<i>North America's largest
food processing concern.</i>

267
00:20:58,608 --> 00:21:01,174
<i>Chester will be granted
two million shares</i>

268
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,176
<i>of Series B preferred stock</i>

269
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,214
<i>which has climbed...</i>

270
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,919
That's the story we wanted.

271
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:12,954
How's our security system
coming along?

272
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:14,990
I mean,
your firewall's still weak.

273
00:21:14,992 --> 00:21:16,792
So what's the plan?

274
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:18,660
Update your protocols.

275
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:20,161
IMXP to FLX.

276
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:23,464
Rewire your firmware
to JLS 5.0 standards.

277
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:27,136
And... Databases, thank God,
are still running on NTS.

278
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:30,572
- Tell me, can we go forward?
- Yes, but...

279
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:33,243
- Great.
- One thing you both should know.

280
00:21:33,443 --> 00:21:35,643
Hackers often infiltrate
their companies

281
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:37,080
through their employees.

282
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:38,950
It's fast and easy.

283
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:41,482
Other personal info
is there to be lifted

284
00:21:41,484 --> 00:21:44,118
from their social
networking profiles.

285
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,454
We should let the employees know

286
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:47,388
that office computers
are to be used

287
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,658
for company use only.

288
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:52,063
I can set up
some surveillance machines

289
00:21:52,495 --> 00:21:54,130
so we can keep them in line.

290
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:57,432
We'll give you ten days.

291
00:21:57,434 --> 00:21:58,834
We can't really wait
longer than that.

292
00:21:58,836 --> 00:22:00,234
- Russ?
- Hm?

293
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,006
It's 11:00.

294
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,974
Send me a list
of everything you need.

295
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:41,211
Hi.

296
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:46,517
Russel sent me over to see
how you settled in and...

297
00:22:48,184 --> 00:22:50,287
I brought
the files you requested.

298
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:03,968
It's nice.

299
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,244
You know, I was against
hiring you at first.

300
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,515
But now I'm just as impressed
as Russel is.

301
00:23:23,854 --> 00:23:25,388
Do you mind?

302
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:30,528
I can't stand those heels.

303
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:36,968
Would you?

304
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,419
You don't have much experience
with women, do you?

305
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:05,362
How about this?

306
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:12,536
You know, I've been wondering...

307
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:15,606
What turns you on?

308
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:21,512
Cyber sex?

309
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:41,532
What do you think about that?

310
00:24:58,649 --> 00:24:59,951
Okay.

311
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:05,289
It's just a test.

312
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:10,095
Our enemies aren't above
using such...

313
00:25:10,462 --> 00:25:11,496
traps.

314
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:17,536
We're giving you access to a lot
of valuable information.

315
00:25:18,104 --> 00:25:19,304
You know that.

316
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,473
Russel...

317
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:25,210
trusts you.

318
00:25:29,581 --> 00:25:30,615
Be on your guard.

319
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:44,527
<i>We're giving you access
to a lot.</i>

320
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:46,396
<i>We've giving you access to a lot
of valuable information.</i>

321
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:48,965
<i>Russel... Russel...</i>

322
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:51,403
<i>Trusts you. Trusts you.</i>

323
00:25:51,903 --> 00:25:53,403
<i>Be on your guard.</i>

324
00:25:53,405 --> 00:25:54,940
<i>Be on your guard.</i>

325
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,530
Is something wrong?

326
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:20,665
No, no.

327
00:26:29,575 --> 00:26:31,275
What are you doing here
all the time?

328
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:32,245
And yourself?

329
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:34,746
Need a good
wireless reception.

330
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:41,988
So what,
do you work in high-tech?

331
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:46,192
Not really.
I'm more interested in history.

332
00:26:46,491 --> 00:26:49,829
- What kind of history?
- I don't know, people?

333
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:52,632
I'm more interested
in the future.

334
00:26:53,367 --> 00:26:56,469
- Technology.
- You're a game tester?

335
00:26:57,637 --> 00:26:58,670
I'm a player.

336
00:26:59,571 --> 00:27:01,107
Look, um...

337
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:07,747
ICMP Protocol 873DDFS3-3.

338
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:11,217
Keylog the passcode
from the database cache.

339
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:14,321
Check for admins,
bypass the honey pot.

340
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:17,657
Keylog the passcode
from the database cache.

341
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,560
Done.

342
00:27:21,962 --> 00:27:23,062
I'm in.

343
00:27:23,963 --> 00:27:24,931
Inside what?

344
00:27:25,331 --> 00:27:26,699
The Bank of Pyongyang.

345
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:29,602
What should I do?

346
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:31,470
I don't know.

347
00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:33,606
Hack a real bank.

348
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,641
Like Bonnie and Clyde?

349
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:37,277
Why not?

350
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:40,613
You know why computers
are so easy to hack?

351
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:44,550
They were never designed
for the internet.

352
00:27:45,618 --> 00:27:48,321
I don't think people are made
for the internet, either.

353
00:27:49,255 --> 00:27:52,625
Personally,
I don't trust computers.

354
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,361
But you have one.

355
00:27:54,927 --> 00:27:56,729
Yeah, what choice do you have?

356
00:27:57,863 --> 00:27:59,299
What do you trust?

357
00:28:02,903 --> 00:28:07,441
No viruses, no batteries,
never crashes.

358
00:28:08,141 --> 00:28:09,209
Very reliable.

359
00:28:09,843 --> 00:28:12,678
I could store a thousand
of those on my key drive.

360
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:15,548
Yeah,
you're just out of this world.

361
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:22,155
- Where are you going?
- I'll find you.

362
00:29:34,661 --> 00:29:37,264
I looked at
their surveillance cameras.

363
00:29:38,932 --> 00:29:40,533
I followed you nonstop

364
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:43,171
from the building
to your hotel...

365
00:29:44,338 --> 00:29:45,473
the other day.

366
00:29:46,605 --> 00:29:49,876
You didn't even see me.
You had your glasses on.

367
00:29:54,714 --> 00:29:56,614
How many Korean banks
did you rob

368
00:29:56,616 --> 00:29:58,783
to afford this place?

369
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:02,323
That's... It came with my job.

370
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:03,790
Well...

371
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:07,694
I guess you have
a good connection here.

372
00:30:11,898 --> 00:30:14,201
Nice to see you.

373
00:30:34,688 --> 00:30:36,656
Hey, sorry,
I missed my bus.

374
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:38,825
No worries.

375
00:30:39,494 --> 00:30:41,227
You like the water?
You want to take a dip?

376
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:43,027
No, I...
I don't know how to swim.

377
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:45,630
A computer hacker that
doesn't drive and doesn't swim.

378
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:47,233
A true modern man.

379
00:30:47,235 --> 00:30:49,370
Come on, your parents
never taught you how to swim?

380
00:30:50,037 --> 00:30:51,706
No, I never had any parents.

381
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:54,508
Look at the advantages.

382
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,544
You're a free man.

383
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:58,278
No roots, you can do whatever
the hell you like.

384
00:30:58,645 --> 00:31:00,414
What about you?
You got any family?

385
00:31:01,014 --> 00:31:03,551
I do whatever the hell
I like as well.

386
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:06,085
I want to ask you something.

387
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:08,521
Have you heard about this
hacking group, Independent Leak?

388
00:31:08,523 --> 00:31:10,024
What do you know
about them?

389
00:31:11,392 --> 00:31:12,958
I know they're tough, radical.

390
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,662
They hack into corporations,
banks, governments,

391
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:18,966
which includes us.

392
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:22,568
They intend on releasing
millions of classified emails

393
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,069
that we do not want going out.

394
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:26,040
We gotta do whatever it takes
to stop them.

395
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:29,308
I'll look into it.

396
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,847
I've got a name for you:
Angela King.

397
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:35,582
We don't have
much information on her,

398
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:37,553
no fixed address,
always on the move.

399
00:31:38,219 --> 00:31:40,353
Sometimes spot her name
on flight manifests,

400
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:41,923
but always a little too late.

401
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,892
Maybe she works for the Chinese.

402
00:31:45,427 --> 00:31:48,029
Nope, she's a freelancer.

403
00:31:50,598 --> 00:31:52,300
How's our firewall?

404
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:53,801
It's safe...

405
00:31:55,236 --> 00:31:56,437
now.

406
00:31:56,938 --> 00:31:57,838
Good.

407
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,078
We can't take any chances.

408
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:06,548
Let's go inside,
I want to give you something.

409
00:32:15,657 --> 00:32:18,357
I went shopping,
got myself a new watch,

410
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,192
and I got you one, too.

411
00:32:20,194 --> 00:32:21,929
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

412
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:25,030
You don't have an excuse
to be late anymore.

413
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:28,704
Now we're both on company time.

414
00:32:29,404 --> 00:32:30,872
How are you getting home?

415
00:32:31,373 --> 00:32:32,806
I'll just catch the bus.

416
00:32:32,808 --> 00:32:34,139
You need wheels in this town.

417
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:35,810
Here, take my car,
it's in the drive.

418
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,678
Is this that performance bonus
you were telling me about?

419
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,516
Let's just consider it
an advance.

420
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:54,429
<i>He was hiring
at the company.</i>

421
00:32:54,863 --> 00:32:58,130
<i>Vanderbilt's representatives
stated that the wholesaler</i>

422
00:32:58,132 --> 00:32:59,666
<i>sold ammonium nitrate</i>

423
00:32:59,668 --> 00:33:02,134
<i>only for agricultural purposes.</i>

424
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:03,936
<i>They declined to comment
on its use</i>

425
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:06,174
<i>in the recent bombing
of the embassy.</i>

426
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:08,675
<i>Vanderbilt's charity raised</i>

427
00:33:08,677 --> 00:33:10,176
<i>over $100 million</i>

428
00:33:10,178 --> 00:33:12,946
<i>in its efforts to combat
the spread of AIDS</i>

429
00:33:12,948 --> 00:33:14,883
<i>in Sub-Saharan Africa.</i>

430
00:33:15,117 --> 00:33:17,486
<i>Though original reports imply...</i>

431
00:33:27,262 --> 00:33:30,465
Do you normally have
meetings at your house?

432
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,001
Normally? No.

433
00:33:33,602 --> 00:33:35,402
But when it's confidential...

434
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:36,773
So, let's get to it.

435
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:40,443
You said we both have some
valuable information to share.

436
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:44,779
- Did I say that?
- You called me ten times.

437
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:46,981
Fair enough, I'm a headhunter.

438
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,719
And I'm looking to recruit
someone for a high-tech company.

439
00:33:51,053 --> 00:33:52,621
I don't work
in the high-tech field.

440
00:33:52,954 --> 00:33:54,722
Do you know anything
about hackers?

441
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:57,159
Anything about
criminal investigations?

442
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,225
I do know about criminals,

443
00:33:59,227 --> 00:34:01,364
but only in relations
to human rights.

444
00:34:01,764 --> 00:34:03,165
That's why
I noticed your profile.

445
00:34:03,466 --> 00:34:07,470
Do you know why Babylon fell?
Too much information.

446
00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:09,539
Too many languages.

447
00:34:09,971 --> 00:34:12,472
The breakdown of communications.

448
00:34:12,474 --> 00:34:14,209
And that's where we are today.

449
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:15,909
That's why
I think it's important

450
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:17,645
to apply international
human rights standards

451
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:18,748
to the internet.

452
00:34:19,147 --> 00:34:21,382
To be honest, Mr. Belial,

453
00:34:21,384 --> 00:34:23,183
I don't think
I have anything to offer you.

454
00:34:23,185 --> 00:34:26,689
Oh, Alice,
never say that to a headhunter.

455
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:28,957
Seriously, I'm...

456
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,828
I'm in bad shape.

457
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,195
I guess I came
at the right time, then.

458
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:38,133
I feel responsible
for the people I've left behind.

459
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,035
I can understand that.

460
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,806
But I think that you're a person

461
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,075
who thinks too much about
what you can do for other people

462
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:52,148
when you should think more about
what can people do for you.

463
00:34:53,983 --> 00:34:56,352
How much would you like
to earn per year?

464
00:34:56,754 --> 00:34:59,522
- What do you mean?
- I mean, give me a number.

465
00:35:12,635 --> 00:35:14,137
Okay, he's in a meeting.

466
00:35:15,873 --> 00:35:17,540
I'll give him the message.

467
00:35:18,307 --> 00:35:20,511
Uh, probably in the afternoon.

468
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:32,789
I'm gonna start working
for another company now, so...

469
00:35:33,022 --> 00:35:35,057
Maybe I can get you a job there.

470
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:37,826
The case's in the hands

471
00:35:37,828 --> 00:35:39,529
of other lawyers, now.

472
00:35:40,963 --> 00:35:42,533
They will take care of it.

473
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:44,733
And you've been compensated.

474
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:46,300
Here, it's on the table.

475
00:35:46,302 --> 00:35:47,668
I've spent days and nights

476
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,106
watching people
under interrogation.

477
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,574
Torture.

478
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:56,245
They're the ones who deserve
compensation, not me.

479
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:58,514
I went as far as I could go.

480
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:00,082
I have to move on.

481
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:03,286
They will have a stronger
defender now, it's better.

482
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,520
No, you abandoned them!

483
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:09,091
The case was putting both you
and me at risk!

484
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:12,061
I need my key drive back.

485
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:17,166
Here, take it.

486
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:20,002
I know you need it.

487
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,574
Don't think
I need anything from you.

488
00:36:24,106 --> 00:36:25,676
I never did.

489
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:12,287
<i>A left, then a right...</i>

490
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:14,789
<i>Oh! And there's a hard uppercut!
Hard to the jaw...</i>

491
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:16,091
You texted me your address,

492
00:37:16,093 --> 00:37:17,728
so I assumed
it was an invitation.

493
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:20,061
<i>He's going
left to right,</i>

494
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,897
<i>a hard one hits the temple...</i>

495
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:24,966
<i>New York City
on opening day,</i>

496
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:26,701
<i>this fight is going down...</i>

497
00:37:29,806 --> 00:37:30,741
Wait.

498
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:32,876
<i>Oh, that uppercut!</i>

499
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,713
I've got
something stronger here.

500
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:56,700
Bottoms up.

501
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:09,146
So you box?

502
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:11,748
Yeah.

503
00:38:12,616 --> 00:38:13,817
Wanna try?

504
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:17,021
I'm sure
you're too strong for me.

505
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,324
Do you play any video games?

506
00:38:20,858 --> 00:38:23,226
Not anymore. That's kid stuff.

507
00:38:24,662 --> 00:38:25,930
I'm playing all the time.

508
00:38:26,798 --> 00:38:29,865
I created a game that combines
virtual reality telepathy

509
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:31,134
in the real world.

510
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:32,904
Here, I'll show you. So...

511
00:38:33,204 --> 00:38:35,004
Basically, in any room,
I can create

512
00:38:35,006 --> 00:38:36,874
a chessboard, 64 squares.

513
00:38:37,207 --> 00:38:41,178
Um... A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

514
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:44,279
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

515
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,515
And then use various objects
in the room

516
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:48,118
as pieces on the chessboard.

517
00:38:48,553 --> 00:38:49,787
You follow me?

518
00:38:50,688 --> 00:38:53,858
- Uh, not really.
- Just pretend.

519
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:58,360
The coffeemaker could be
one of your knights.

520
00:38:58,362 --> 00:39:01,966
And those glasses over there
could be your pawns.

521
00:39:02,232 --> 00:39:04,000
And my bag can be
the black king,

522
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:06,736
and your bag over there,
the white king.

523
00:39:06,738 --> 00:39:08,070
Here, I'll show you, just...

524
00:39:08,072 --> 00:39:10,207
And you play this
all in your head?

525
00:39:10,908 --> 00:39:12,508
- Yeah.
- Oh.

526
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,946
Just, just focus on the game.
Here, close your eyes.

527
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:17,415
Concentrate.

528
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:22,319
Alright, let's begin simply
with a pawn.

529
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,389
I do E2-E4.

530
00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:27,125
Now it's your turn.

531
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:31,529
Try, uh... NG8-F6.

532
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,134
Now, I move my knight
towards you.

533
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,302
NG1-F3. Now your turn.

534
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:42,304
- No, no, don't, don't do that.
- But I didn't do anything.

535
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:45,343
It's telepathy
between you and me.

536
00:39:47,812 --> 00:39:49,080
Trust it.

537
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,684
Try KF6-E4.

538
00:39:53,251 --> 00:39:56,788
Take my pawn.
I move my pawn D2-D3.

539
00:39:57,288 --> 00:39:59,156
Now your knight's in danger.
You should move back.

540
00:39:59,158 --> 00:40:00,723
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

541
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:04,326
Um... NE4-C5.

542
00:40:04,328 --> 00:40:07,166
- How'd you do that?
- Concentration.

543
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:12,370
Okay, I do QD1-E2.

544
00:40:12,804 --> 00:40:15,571
- And you do...
- Q7D.

545
00:40:15,573 --> 00:40:19,575
Yes! Now you protect your king.
I move my queen to the right.

546
00:40:19,577 --> 00:40:22,014
- And you do...
- Sorry, I don't get it.

547
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:24,614
You really know
how to visualize the game.

548
00:40:24,616 --> 00:40:29,021
It's like with permutations
for identifying a password.

549
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:32,558
Each move has a limited number
of combinations.

550
00:40:32,858 --> 00:40:34,092
I get that.

551
00:40:34,692 --> 00:40:36,128
I am impressed.

552
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:38,229
Don't be.

553
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:49,273
Mind if I crash here?

554
00:43:10,683 --> 00:43:12,118
I had a dream last night.

555
00:43:12,585 --> 00:43:13,486
Really?

556
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,388
Yeah, you were in it.

557
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,558
No kidding.

558
00:43:21,128 --> 00:43:22,494
I gotta go.

559
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:27,566
Flying to Washington, D.C.
with my boss today.

560
00:43:32,071 --> 00:43:33,339
Thanks.

561
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,276
"Thank you" for what?

562
00:43:44,684 --> 00:43:47,251
Soyan, I want you
to meet Jim Howard.

563
00:43:47,253 --> 00:43:49,521
Jim represents us in Washington.

564
00:43:49,856 --> 00:43:52,323
Soyan's our new
Chief Tech Officer.

565
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:54,727
He's our to go-to guy now.

566
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:10,543
- Something happening?
- No.

567
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:14,612
- My secretaries update me.
- About our case?

568
00:44:14,614 --> 00:44:15,648
Indirectly.

569
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,252
Do you know what Six Sigma is?

570
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,721
Six Sigma is a method
of control and error.

571
00:44:22,488 --> 00:44:25,292
It reduces
the causes and defects

572
00:44:26,626 --> 00:44:30,597
to the lowest percentage,
thus insuring predictability.

573
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:34,098
- Look, Jim, we're working on it.
- Working on who?

574
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,402
Angela King.

575
00:44:35,868 --> 00:44:40,039
The kid has some information.
She's on a flight next week.

576
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,109
- Where to?
- Caribbean.

577
00:44:42,508 --> 00:44:43,808
What kind of plane?

578
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:46,378
Small commercial
aircraft, 20-seater.

579
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,314
- Prop plane, jet plane?
- It's a prop plane.

580
00:44:51,285 --> 00:44:53,187
We need you
to take care of this for us.

581
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:55,522
We can't afford this
getting out.

582
00:44:56,324 --> 00:44:58,323
- We'll handle it.
- Do you know what's at stake?

583
00:44:58,325 --> 00:44:59,657
- Yes, I do!
- Do you know what's at stake?

584
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:01,561
Don't interrupt me,
listen to me.

585
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:05,730
I am accountable
for $750 billion.

586
00:45:05,732 --> 00:45:08,634
That's more than the net gross
of most countries in the world.

587
00:45:09,269 --> 00:45:10,437
Yes.

588
00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:13,440
Get it done.

589
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:16,844
If something goes down,
you're going, too.

590
00:45:34,328 --> 00:45:36,630
You shouldn't worry
about Loise.

591
00:45:37,931 --> 00:45:39,367
She's getting to him.

592
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,336
I'm losing the boy.

593
00:45:44,939 --> 00:45:45,838
Not her.

594
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:48,275
Take her out of this.

595
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:50,475
You know her,
she worked for you.

596
00:45:50,477 --> 00:45:52,244
I mean, it's a little too close
for comfort.

597
00:45:52,246 --> 00:45:53,578
What the fuck is going on?

598
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,517
Are you
her guardian angel or what?

599
00:45:55,582 --> 00:45:56,451
Yes.

600
00:45:56,984 --> 00:45:58,085
I mean, no.

601
00:45:58,353 --> 00:45:59,521
I'll take care of her.

602
00:46:00,888 --> 00:46:02,056
Don't worry about her.

603
00:46:04,558 --> 00:46:06,361
Well...

604
00:46:07,362 --> 00:46:09,562
It still leaves me
with the bigger issue.

605
00:46:10,864 --> 00:46:12,299
What to do with him.

606
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:15,537
He's your protégé, not mine.

607
00:46:30,151 --> 00:46:31,252
Hey.

608
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:33,487
I need a drink.

609
00:47:03,784 --> 00:47:06,988
So how would you play your game
in this hotel suite?

610
00:47:08,456 --> 00:47:12,358
A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

611
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,995
I thought
you weren't interested.

612
00:47:15,029 --> 00:47:16,397
I can win.

613
00:47:18,266 --> 00:47:19,834
Whites or blacks, you choose.

614
00:47:22,002 --> 00:47:22,970
This one.

615
00:47:24,272 --> 00:47:25,440
You start.

616
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,476
E2-E4.

617
00:47:28,775 --> 00:47:29,978
C7-C5.

618
00:47:30,711 --> 00:47:32,213
NG1-F3.

619
00:47:32,714 --> 00:47:34,549
Hold on,
let me show you something.

620
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:39,787
- What is that?
- Just put it on.

621
00:47:43,192 --> 00:47:44,293
Alright.

622
00:47:45,759 --> 00:47:48,361
One, two, three.

623
00:47:49,796 --> 00:47:53,201
- You see something?
- Yeah! It's beautiful.

624
00:47:53,668 --> 00:47:56,337
Alright, same thing.
Concentrate.

625
00:47:57,705 --> 00:47:59,575
- You with me?
- Yeah.

626
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:02,844
NB8-C6.

627
00:48:03,245 --> 00:48:04,746
NB1-C3.

628
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:07,049
NG8-F6.

629
00:48:07,715 --> 00:48:09,484
QD4-D8.

630
00:48:10,051 --> 00:48:11,417
Where's the king?

631
00:48:11,419 --> 00:48:13,888
Okay, E7-E6.

632
00:48:14,189 --> 00:48:15,990
E3-E2.

633
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:18,693
BF1-B5.

634
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:21,162
As ordered, my queen.

635
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:22,730
Checkmate.

636
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:24,533
Indeed.

637
00:48:24,832 --> 00:48:27,735
- I think you lost intentionally.
- Oh, yeah?

638
00:48:38,447 --> 00:48:40,382
What are you doing?

639
00:48:46,255 --> 00:48:49,491
Please step on it.
I don't want to miss my flight.

640
00:48:50,725 --> 00:48:52,828
So how often
do they see each other?

641
00:48:54,029 --> 00:48:55,164
I don't know.

642
00:48:55,531 --> 00:48:57,865
- I thought you kept tabs on him.
- I do.

643
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:03,871
The kid is young and naïve.
We took a huge risk with him.

644
00:49:04,473 --> 00:49:05,507
So what about this girl?

645
00:49:05,974 --> 00:49:09,809
Apparently, she worked
for my new lawyer friend.

646
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:12,212
And you think
it's just a coincidence

647
00:49:12,214 --> 00:49:13,449
that they worked together?

648
00:49:14,316 --> 00:49:16,684
- Maybe she's spying on us.
- I doubt it, Lena.

649
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:19,922
Listen, I'll figure it out.
Don't worry about it.

650
00:49:20,756 --> 00:49:23,224
So what did your new
lawyer friend say about her?

651
00:49:23,891 --> 00:49:26,928
She said the girl's
not a problem, but I...

652
00:49:27,696 --> 00:49:29,831
I had to dig a little deeper.

653
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:31,667
And?

654
00:49:32,101 --> 00:49:35,004
And... I fucked her.

655
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:41,074
- You fucked the lawyer?
- Yes, I fucked the lawyer.

656
00:49:41,076 --> 00:49:43,446
It's just business, Lena.

657
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:48,548
Aren't you proud
of yourself, Russ?

658
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:49,882
I think
she's in love with me

659
00:49:49,884 --> 00:49:52,021
and I can't do anything
about it.

660
00:49:53,088 --> 00:49:54,189
She wanted a job.

661
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:55,989
And I gave her one.

662
00:49:55,991 --> 00:49:57,692
Russ, I think
you believe in yourself

663
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,663
a little bit
too much sometimes.

664
00:50:01,263 --> 00:50:02,565
And what's worse...

665
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,900
you believe your own lies.

666
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:20,949
This view is perfect
for a screensaver.

667
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,854
You see that little star
over there?

668
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,193
In that star
are all the people I love.

669
00:50:36,165 --> 00:50:37,533
Did you see this one?

670
00:50:39,935 --> 00:50:40,903
Satellite.

671
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:42,938
Or a plane.

672
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:47,444
Do you think we're
a part of this universe?

673
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:50,213
Not at all.

674
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:09,420
Who is it?

675
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,655
It's my brother.

676
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:16,594
He vanished a long time ago.

677
00:53:17,796 --> 00:53:19,363
Out of nowhere.

678
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,998
Did you search for him
on the internet?

679
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,568
I'm so tired of searching.

680
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:26,069
What happened?

681
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:32,243
I was at a fair
with my sister and my brother.

682
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:37,047
Remember those
video game arcades?

683
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,986
I could spend hours
on those machines.

684
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:46,256
My brother would wander
the arcade while I played.

685
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,392
As kids do.

686
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,962
But this time,
he never came back.

687
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:56,400
I looked for hours,
for days, for years.

688
00:53:57,301 --> 00:54:00,404
But I... I couldn't go
to the police because...

689
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:02,974
I was on probation for drugs.

690
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:05,775
They took my sister away,

691
00:54:05,777 --> 00:54:07,746
and I never saw
my brother again.

692
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:09,914
How old would he be today?

693
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:12,283
20 something.

694
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:24,561
I suppose you've already checked
the juvenile records database.

695
00:54:24,563 --> 00:54:26,965
It must be in there somewhere.

696
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:28,867
What was his name?

697
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:30,969
Jeremy.

698
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,105
Here's the website.

699
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,044
I can actually search
for you later if you want.

700
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:41,913
I gotta go.

701
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:32,662
<i>Arms dealer Vanderbilt</i>

702
00:55:32,664 --> 00:55:34,163
<i>was arrested then released</i>

703
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:36,000
<i>after only a few hours.</i>

704
00:55:36,002 --> 00:55:38,735
<i>He has been identified by the
International Criminal Court</i>

705
00:55:38,737 --> 00:55:42,407
<i>as a person of interest
in violating the embargo.</i>

706
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:44,273
<i>Over the last 20 years,</i>

707
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:47,577
<i>Vanderbilt has built
one of the most powerful...</i>

708
00:55:52,851 --> 00:55:54,953
I talked to Washington
this morning.

709
00:55:57,123 --> 00:55:59,424
Jim Howard sends his regards.

710
00:56:02,962 --> 00:56:04,797
Someone got Angela King.

711
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:07,700
You know who got her?

712
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:10,969
It makes no difference.
She's out of the picture.

713
00:56:11,636 --> 00:56:15,473
Anyway, I just don't like
insects in my pool.

714
00:56:16,675 --> 00:56:17,909
We won this round.

715
00:56:18,144 --> 00:56:20,146
But we've got to be
careful what's next.

716
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:23,548
We have to anticipate
the other guy's move.

717
00:56:23,816 --> 00:56:25,283
Kind of like a chess game.

718
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:27,553
You play?

719
00:56:28,654 --> 00:56:29,555
No.

720
00:56:30,389 --> 00:56:31,357
You should.

721
00:56:32,091 --> 00:56:34,225
Business, politics, life...

722
00:56:35,193 --> 00:56:36,528
it's all like chess.

723
00:56:37,362 --> 00:56:39,497
You gotta be two steps ahead.

724
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:43,234
How's our firewall doing?

725
00:56:44,335 --> 00:56:45,805
It's strong.

726
00:56:46,972 --> 00:56:48,107
Good.

727
00:57:09,128 --> 00:57:10,963
What's happening?
You...

728
00:57:11,797 --> 00:57:13,299
You vanished.

729
00:57:17,269 --> 00:57:19,436
How did my files
end up on your computer?

730
00:57:19,438 --> 00:57:20,837
I don't know
what you're talking about.

731
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:22,672
My files, asshole!

732
00:57:22,674 --> 00:57:24,542
I don't know
what you're talking about!

733
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:27,179
Who are you?

734
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,312
Who the fuck are you?

735
00:57:29,314 --> 00:57:31,548
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

736
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,920
- Just trust me, alright?
- Get the fuck out of here.

737
00:57:36,055 --> 00:57:37,323
Leave me alone.

738
00:57:57,943 --> 00:57:59,946
My name is Soyan Swartz.

739
00:58:00,713 --> 00:58:02,816
And I am an internet activist.

740
00:58:03,415 --> 00:58:05,549
I have infiltrated
the IT systems

741
00:58:05,551 --> 00:58:08,854
of numerous government agencies
and corporations.

742
00:58:09,755 --> 00:58:12,022
Over the years,
I have sought out to expose

743
00:58:12,024 --> 00:58:13,793
classified information.

744
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,326
Today I found something
that requires

745
00:58:16,328 --> 00:58:17,763
immediate disclosure.

746
00:58:18,898 --> 00:58:22,633
Today, many companies are trying
to rewrite our history

747
00:58:22,635 --> 00:58:23,804
and alter the truth.

748
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:25,703
As Mao, Lenin, and others

749
00:58:25,705 --> 00:58:27,839
used propaganda
for political goals,

750
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:31,576
corporations now control images
for commercial purposes.

751
00:58:31,578 --> 00:58:33,076
We are on the verge
of a new world

752
00:58:33,078 --> 00:58:35,179
in which objective facts
can be altered

753
00:58:35,181 --> 00:58:36,647
in the name
of public relations

754
00:58:36,649 --> 00:58:39,052
by companies who are larger
than states.

755
00:58:39,351 --> 00:58:42,555
The media is the most
powerful entity in the world.

756
00:58:42,822 --> 00:58:45,256
They have the power
to make the innocent guilty

757
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:46,523
and the guilty innocent,

758
00:58:46,525 --> 00:58:48,259
and that's power
because they control

759
00:58:48,261 --> 00:58:50,096
the minds of the masses.

760
00:58:53,233 --> 00:58:55,834
My name is Soyan Swartz,

761
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:57,436
and I wish you all good luck.

762
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:37,143
What's going on in here?

763
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:45,018
There are three real ways
to escape a bad situation.

764
00:59:46,385 --> 00:59:48,889
You can attack your enemy
and fight back.

765
00:59:49,555 --> 00:59:52,192
You can defend yourself,
and limit the damages.

766
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,428
Or you can just kill yourself
and exit the game altogether.

767
00:59:59,267 --> 01:00:00,500
What are you doing?

768
01:00:02,736 --> 01:00:04,171
You're a sweet boy.

769
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:08,142
Intelligent, even brilliant...

770
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,610
but so naïve.

771
01:00:10,977 --> 01:00:12,178
Who sent you here?

772
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:13,578
Russel?

773
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,449
That girlfriend of yours? Loise?

774
01:00:16,816 --> 01:00:19,884
- Has been hacking your computer.
- How do you know that?

775
01:00:19,886 --> 01:00:21,055
We have sources.

776
01:00:21,488 --> 01:00:23,523
Who are you spying on,
her or me?

777
01:00:24,926 --> 01:00:27,594
I'm just trying to save
that nice ass of yours.

778
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:30,197
She played you.

779
01:00:30,965 --> 01:00:34,432
She doesn't want you,
she wants your files.

780
01:00:34,434 --> 01:00:36,903
- I don't believe it.
- Well, you better believe it!

781
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:38,536
Because that is the only story

782
01:00:38,538 --> 01:00:40,408
that's gonna fly
with Russel and his clients.

783
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:42,609
We still have
a lot of work to do.

784
01:00:43,411 --> 01:00:44,811
Stay away from her.

785
01:00:52,053 --> 01:00:53,621
You've been warned.

786
01:01:16,345 --> 01:01:18,713
Answer me.
Loise, answer me!

787
01:01:21,148 --> 01:01:23,150
Wake up.

788
01:01:44,939 --> 01:01:47,806
- What are you doing here?
- It's okay, it's okay.

789
01:01:49,176 --> 01:01:52,046
- Go away.
- I'm gonna get us out of here.

790
01:01:52,747 --> 01:01:54,849
I'm gonna get us
out of here, okay?

791
01:01:55,983 --> 01:01:57,218
Alright?

792
01:03:16,898 --> 01:03:18,164
Where are we?

793
01:03:23,205 --> 01:03:24,339
Who are you?

794
01:03:27,209 --> 01:03:28,477
Some time ago...

795
01:03:30,011 --> 01:03:33,215
I bonded with other hackers.

796
01:03:36,118 --> 01:03:37,853
I started Independent Leak.

797
01:03:41,491 --> 01:03:42,924
We hacked banks...

798
01:03:44,059 --> 01:03:45,560
corporations...

799
01:03:46,461 --> 01:03:47,860
police databases,

800
01:03:47,862 --> 01:03:50,631
insurance companies,
everything we could.

801
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:54,467
We have millions of emails

802
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:57,573
and databases with secrets
people have to know.

803
01:03:58,541 --> 01:03:59,908
About what?

804
01:04:01,344 --> 01:04:02,777
Classified information.

805
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:07,016
I'm gonna release those emails.

806
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,016
We're gonna get out of here.

807
01:04:10,018 --> 01:04:12,354
Where did you leave
those emails?

808
01:04:12,754 --> 01:04:15,724
I have a copy at the hotel
and a backup hidden elsewhere.

809
01:04:18,293 --> 01:04:19,861
I'm with you.

810
01:04:28,304 --> 01:04:29,738
Stay with me.

811
01:06:20,816 --> 01:06:23,553
See you on the rooftop.
9:00 p.m.

812
01:07:33,457 --> 01:07:35,025
Well, I pay for this room.

813
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,495
And the room next door.

814
01:07:49,406 --> 01:07:50,807
Soyan?

815
01:07:52,376 --> 01:07:53,910
I can't hear you.

816
01:07:54,277 --> 01:07:56,781
So, Angela King.

817
01:07:57,981 --> 01:08:00,016
Like the king in the chess game.

818
01:08:01,652 --> 01:08:03,755
And Angela like an angel unseen.

819
01:08:05,088 --> 01:08:06,921
<i>Create

820
01:08:06,923 --> 01:08:08,989
Book hotel rooms
and flights in her name,

821
01:08:08,991 --> 01:08:12,462
and keep us chasing someone
who doesn't even exist.

822
01:08:13,096 --> 01:08:16,364
<i>And then,
just as we're about to close in,</i>

823
01:08:16,366 --> 01:08:18,201
you kill her off online.

824
01:08:18,502 --> 01:08:21,706
- Just like you did Bella Blue.
- How did you find out it was me?

825
01:08:22,372 --> 01:08:23,907
Company time.

826
01:08:32,883 --> 01:08:35,318
How much did they pay you
to stop Independent Leak?

827
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:38,756
How much information
do you have on us?

828
01:08:39,523 --> 01:08:42,894
Enough. Enough to show
how you manipulated the media.

829
01:08:43,293 --> 01:08:46,762
So, you left
your IP address intentionally.

830
01:08:46,764 --> 01:08:48,232
That was a red herring.

831
01:08:48,932 --> 01:08:51,235
Big companies
often hire their hackers.

832
01:08:51,569 --> 01:08:53,638
I came in like a Trojan horse.

833
01:08:54,071 --> 01:08:55,905
I wonder how many more like you

834
01:08:55,907 --> 01:08:58,341
are gonna come out of the belly
of that wooden steed.

835
01:08:58,575 --> 01:09:00,110
We're like an army.

836
01:09:01,244 --> 01:09:02,545
Small rooms.

01:09:07,117 --> 01:09:08,419
But we have eyes.

840
01:09:08,786 --> 01:09:10,721
And we see everything.

841
01:09:12,623 --> 01:09:14,725
You're gonna lose your queen.

842
01:09:15,928 --> 01:09:17,863
I don't think so.

843
01:09:18,563 --> 01:09:22,332
You see, I'm afraid
this game has come to an end.

844
01:09:25,636 --> 01:09:27,003
Checkmate.

845
01:09:39,584 --> 01:09:40,752
You see...

846
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:45,055
backstories,
that's what I'm good at.

847
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:49,925
A promising, young employee
of a high-tech company

848
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:53,764
found dead in hotel room
by heart attack.

849
01:09:54,131 --> 01:09:56,198
And when
the authorities contact me,

850
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,169
I'll tell them
how shocking it is.

851
01:09:58,469 --> 01:10:01,472
I'd seen him the night before,
he seemed fine.

852
01:10:01,773 --> 01:10:05,209
We were unaware
of any health conditions.

853
01:10:05,611 --> 01:10:08,878
We'll throw you a nice funeral.
Hell, I'll even pay for it.

854
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,882
And, in a short time,
it won't matter.

855

Did you see a young guy
who was staying here?

865
01:11:46,945 --> 01:11:50,015
- I need to find him.
- He passed away.

866
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:52,951
Heart attack, they said.

867
01:11:55,053 --> 01:11:57,991
- Where is he?
- They pick up the body.

868

A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Hurry, Soyan, my boyfriend,
he worked for a company.

884

He invented a chess game,
QD4-D8, he said.

Open it, quick.

01:15:03,776 --> 01:15:05,043

Hey, I think...

01:16:10,143 --> 01:16:12,010
We'll need to disguise

- Sure.

967
01:21:16,553 --> 01:21:19,421
But do you remember anything?

968
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:21,988
As Jeremy?

969
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:23,792
Just some fragments.

970
01:21:24,693 --> 01:21:27,060
The nurse said
I bumped my head into something

971
01:21:27,062 --> 01:21:28,897
like a swing at the fair.

972
01:21:30,233 --> 01:21:34,304
But this scar is all I have
to remember from that time.

973
01:21:38,508 --> 01:21:39,677
What did the doctor say?

974
01:21:40,109 --> 01:21:43,646
They said it was a rare form
of retrograde amnesia.

975
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:49,684
It's like if a computer
had its hard drive crash.

976
01:21:49,686 --> 01:21:50,985
Everything still works,

977
01:21:50,987 --> 01:21:52,956
but I still need
to recover the files.

978
01:21:53,523 --> 01:21:55,691
And I didn't get
much help at the orphanage

979
01:21:55,693 --> 01:21:57,427
since no one came to get me.

980
01:21:58,127 --> 01:21:59,462
It's all my fault.

981
01:22:00,063 --> 01:22:04,100
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, don't be sorry.

982
01:22:05,068 --> 01:22:06,403
I have a good life.

983
01:22:07,337 --> 01:22:08,638
I don't blame anyone.

984
01:22:09,038 --> 01:22:12,808
I swear, I spent all my time
trying to find you.

985
01:22:16,579 --> 01:22:17,681
How's Eileen?

986
01:22:18,314 --> 01:22:19,683
She's in New York.

987
01:22:22,486 --> 01:22:25,188
She was so happy
to hear about you.

988
01:22:26,089 --> 01:22:28,659
But she didn't want to cry
in front of you.

989
01:22:29,193 --> 01:22:31,628
She's emotional.

990
01:22:33,596 --> 01:22:35,465
She'll come over eventually.

991
01:22:40,003 --> 01:22:41,004
Look.

992
01:22:46,577 --> 01:22:47,877
This is her.

993
01:22:48,545 --> 01:22:49,912
This is you.

994
01:22:55,385 --> 01:22:58,689
This is us... all together.

995
01:23:05,228 --> 01:23:07,698
I'll come back
with Eileen next time.

996
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:13,137
Um, by the way, who helped you
track me down on the internet?

997
01:23:13,704 --> 01:23:15,973
Soyan... a friend.

998
01:23:16,674 --> 01:23:18,575
A dear friend of mine.
