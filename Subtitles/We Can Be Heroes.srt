00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,430
Not worried, not worried…

183
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,476
[exhales slowly]

184
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,066
So I'm Miss Granada,
director of the Heroics program.

185
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,902
You'll be staying
in our underground stronghold

186
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,112
where children of superheroes
are kept safe

187
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,240
while their parents fight enemy forces.

188
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,409
We can't afford to have even one of you
fall into enemy hands.

189
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,494
This way.

190
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,288
Do I really have to go in?

191
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,623
Because I won't fit in.

192
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,583
I just don't belong.

193
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,086
I mean, I'm different from all of them.

194
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,256
Besides, my dad doesn't fight anymore.

195
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,800
And after my mom died, he promised that--

196
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,678
Yes, well, you know what they say
about promises?

197
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,765
You should always keep them
or you're a liar who can never be trusted?

198
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,727
Are you going to be a problem, Missy?

199
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,980
Shall we?

200
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,617
Everyone…

201
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,411
this is Missy.

202
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,454
She will be joining you today.

203
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,125
Missy, I'd appreciate it
if you would take a seat right there

204
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,087
and quietly continue your studies
along with the other children.

205
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,632
Children…

206
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,427
thank you for respecting my rules.

207
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,221
Your parents will be very proud
when I tell them

208
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,848
of your exceptional behavior.

209
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,392
Well done. [chuckles softly]

210
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,874

219
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,419
Hey, I'm Wheels.

220
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,963
Yes, they call me that
on account of the wheelchair.

221
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,050
It's a little on the nose,
but I like it because it's cool.

222
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,094
Okay.

223
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,930
You may think I'm in the chair
'cause my legs are weak,

224
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,431
but it's the opposite.

225
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,351
My muscles are so strong
my bones can't support 'em.

226
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,187
But lucky for me,
my brain's the same way.

227
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,730
It's supercharged,

228
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,856
so I'm good.

229
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,650
So, Wheels, who's your new friend?

230
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,276
Missy, this is Noodles.

231
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,445
We call him that because, well…

232
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,739
He stretches and twists around
like a noodle?

233
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,865
Yeah, basically.

234
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,992
And that's Ojo.

235
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,161
Her power is she's a genius drawer.

236
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,915
Like Van Gogh mixed with Monet
with just a sprinkle of Salvador Dali.

237
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:48,999
Can I see that?

238
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,130
A kid standing on top of floating chairs?

239
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,677
An exploding exercise ball?

240
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,429
Nothing she draws makes sense.

241
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,305
[Missy] That me?

242
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,685
-Why'd you draw me in front of the class?
-Oh, she won't answer.

243
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,770
She only speaks through her drawings.

No, you don't. You have no clue.

And this is A Capella.

247
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,281
-It me.
-That's your superpower? You can sing?

248
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,658
Yep, but I have an unusual range.

249
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,619
I can go low… [sings very low]

250
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,457
or I can go high! [sings very high]

251
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,292
I can even go really…

00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,135
please refrain from using your high voice.

[laughter]

260
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,186
And she can sing so low
that she moves objects.

261
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,229
Show her how you make things float!

All righty, let's see who's left.

265
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,228
That's Blinding Fast's kid, Slo-Mo.

266
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,650
[Wheels] He's actually moving very fast,

267
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,528
but somehow,
his powers have him stuck in a time warp.

268
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,072
[slowly] Hi.

269
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,991

274
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,003
He makes the craziest faces.

275
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,468
It's impossible!

276
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,096

You were taking so long, I skipped you

with the normal kids.

Why would they put a kid with superpowers
in with normal kids?

Oh, I get it.

Of course you didn't.

it's none other than Blinding Fast,

Oh no.
I'm just getting some terrible news.

It's almost unimaginable,
but two of our heroes

How did this guy get to be president?

435

He can't even put two sentences together.

436
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,362
We have just received a message

As long as you stay where you are,
you are all safe.

453
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,371
Yeah, right. They can't protect us
from that. We just saw it.

00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,664
You got a better idea?

455
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,875
We should probably do
what Miss Granada says.

Why?

462

Because the aliens know where we are,

She drew these things five minutes
before they happened.

Ojo's superpower isn't that she can draw,

471

00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,874
Come on, it's time
we show these aliens what's what.

900
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,669
[Wild Card] Hurry up, Slo-Mo!

901
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,262
[Missy] Look, there's the supply ship.

902
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,680
Just like Ojo's drawing!

903
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,433
[kids] Ew. Gross!

904
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,935
Shh. Keep it down!

905
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:54,520
Wait.

906
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,313
Wait a second.

907
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,439
Let's go.

908
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,951
Shut the door and let's get out of here.

909
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,120
-Wheels, can you--
-No! We're not all here!

910
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,622
What? Who's missing?

911
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,624
Oh… [sighs]

912
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,591
Slo-Mo! Cut it out! Run!

913
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,260
[snarling]

914
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,470
Hurry! They're coming back!

915
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,640
-Ten to one says he's tentacled.
-Dude!

916
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:35,185
-[Rewind] Come on, Slo-Mo!
-[kids shout encouragement]

917
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,938
[vocalizes "Chariots of Fire"]

918
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,613
[growling, snarling]

919
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,075
All right, hold me down!

920
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,210
Slo-Mo!

921
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:01,962
Yes!

922
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,174
[screaming]

923
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,302
Wheels, tell me you figured this out!

924
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,053
It's incredibly intuitive.

925
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:11,889
Whoa!

926
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,975
[screaming]

927
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,021
-Please just choose any button!
-It might be one of these.

928
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,401
[screaming]

929
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,195
[engine starts]

930
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,255
But now what?

931
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,799
Don't worry.

932
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:52,137
Any minute now, Ojo's gonna draw
a picture of all of us smiling

933
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,722
and hugging our parents.

934
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,724
Isn't that right, Ojo?

935
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:59,019
Oh, that's just great.

936
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:02,981
Hey…

937
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:07,194
why did you choose me to share
the idea of looking at Ojo's iPad?

938
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,779
I don't know.

939
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:12,574
I guess I know how hard it feels
when everyone expects so much from you,

940
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,743
and you feel like you can't deliver.

941
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,454
Do you believe I can?

942
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,122
We all believe you can.

943
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,541
Tell that to my parents.

944
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,627
I will,

945
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,129
right after we rescue them.

946
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,059
I'm gonna go check it out.

947
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,318
We're all good.

948
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:53,198
Am I just really small,
or is this ship really big?

949
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:56,910
-It's enormous.
-Yeah. How are we gonna find our parents?

950
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,412
I was thinking about that.

951
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:02,332
Mrs. Granada found us really easily
back at Grandma's house,

952
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,084
and I think I know how,

953
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,377
your bracelet.

954
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,338
I haven't been able to contact my dad.

955
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,633
But maybe the transmitter in here
that connects the two bracelets

956
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,343
works like a tracking device.

957
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,346
But I need a pair of pliers
and a heat source.

958
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,932
My teeth are strong
because my dad's a shark.

959
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,351
-Perfect.
-And I've got a heat source.

960
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,020
Heat vision!

961
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,772
Now he's a toaster.

962
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,401
Close enough.

963
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,423
[bracelet beeping]

964
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,444
Is it working?

965
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,988
Well, it's leading us somewhere.

966
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,909
[bracelet continues beeping]

967
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,621
Hey! That was really good back there.

968
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,415
Turning into a toaster
instead of making heat vision?

969
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,085
It was heat-related. That's real progress.

970
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,295
I guess it's progress.

971
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,379
You just watch.

972
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,591
Pretty soon, you'll be teleporting
like it's nobody's business.

973
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,675
It's about belief.

974
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,302
Um, guys…

975
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,887
[rumbling]

976
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,223
Does anybody else hear that?

977
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,309
What is that?

978
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,353
It's below us.

979
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,901
I can feel it.

980
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,403
[rattling]

981
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,739

00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,368

[chittering]

986
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,348
[Facemaker] Which way?

987
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,226
That way!

988
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,066

[vocalizes]

990
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,206
Look at that thing.

991
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,961
[door opening]

992
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,760
What the heck
is the president doing here?

993
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,640
So they're inside this thing?
All of them?

994
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:09,603
-[man] That's correct.
-How long before the takeover begins?

995
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,273
According to the supreme commander,
less than an hour.

996
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,399
[president] So soon?

997
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,985
[man] That's what she says,
and she's never wrong.

998
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,612
You don't have to remind me.

999
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,239
Ever wonder why we bother with all this

1000
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,825
when she already knows
how it's gonna turn out?

1001
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,119
All part of the process, I suppose.

1002
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,999
What is that thing?

1003
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,961
You heard him. It's a rocket
stuffed to the gills with aliens.

1004
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,798
In less than an hour, they'll send it
down to Earth and start the takeover.

1005
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,344
Well, then we have to stop them. Let's go.

1006
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,225
Do you children have any idea
what you've done?

1007
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,352
Stealing one of our trains?

1008
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,312
Turning headquarters upside down?

1009
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,857
Flying an alien shuttle
into outer space. Hmm?

1010
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,195
[squeals] Well done!

1011
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:04,741
Looks like
we underestimated your abilities

1012
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,493
and your leadership qualities.

1013
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,537
You took a huge risk,
but it was the right risk.

1014
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,540
Headquarters was attacked
just minutes after you escaped.

1015
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,919
If you hadn't broken out,
you would have all been captured.

1016
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:19,673
And now you've managed to lead us
into the heart of this alien mother ship?

1017
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,383
[gasps] Mm.

1018
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,551
So proud!

1019
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,388
Wait, so we're not in trouble?

1020
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,014
Of course not.

1021
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,808
You are heroes.

1022
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,768
-Yeah!
-[cheering]

1023
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,770
Yes! [chuckles]

1024
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:34,980
[Wheels] Missy!

1025
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,774
Her vital signs are all over the place.

1026
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,323
Save your breath, Granada.

1027
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,284
They know.

1028
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,329
Uh-oh!

1029
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,914
[slithering sound]

1030
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,710
Hmm…

1031
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,628
Well, then… round them up!

1032
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,214
[kids grunt]

1033
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,973
[chittering]

1034
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,434
[Facemaker] Watch it!

1035
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,321
[grunts]

1036
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,366
Quit the pantomime, Slo-Mo.

1037
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,493
-You didn't even scrape a knee.
-Mm-hmm.

1038
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,870
[Granada] Oh, good.

1039
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:35,707
Just the kind of divisive attitude
I've been counting on.

1040
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,544
You kids are just like your parents.

1041
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,670
The same in-fighting.

1042
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:42,964
The same bickering.

1043
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,843
Putting your own egos ahead of your team.

1044
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,429
-Take away her water.
-[gasps]

1045
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,389
[gasps]

1046
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,602
They're too powerful together.

1047
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,942
Oh, don't worry.

1048
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,487
I won't take away your little toy.

1049
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,114
I already know what your future is.

1050
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,284
Imprisonment.

1051
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,828
Life long.

1052
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,123
Hmm.

1053
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,876
[chuckles]

1054
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,214

1055
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,510
[clunking]

1056
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:32,180
How are we getting out of here?

1057
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,603
I…

1058
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,272
don't know.

1059
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,150
[sighs]

1060
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,070
What do you mean you don't know?

1061
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:48,863
I mean…

1062
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,824
[sighs] I don't know.

1063
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,618
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

1064
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:54,786
Enough thinking.

1065
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,372
I'm gonna punch my way out of here.

1066
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,334
I have to save my son.

1067
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,503
[grunting]

1068
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,713
That's not gonna work.

1069
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,133
How do you know?

1070
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,886
While you were blinking your eyes,
I went around and tried everything.

1071
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,012
[mocks]

1072
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,601
Uh, you were saying?

1073
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,731
[snarling]

1074
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,486
What are you? An alien spy?

1075
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,197
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1076
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,991
I just want to see what it is.

1077
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,285
Don't worry.

Hmm!

1087

Hi, Mom.

1088
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,809

1091

You… dropped your guard.

1092
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:12,155
And you…
attacked when you should have blocked.

1093
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:17,327
And you rushed
when you should've calculated. Eh?

1094
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,789
I hope your kids
paid more attention to me than you did.

1095
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,666

I bet Miss Granada's
been working there for years.

1097
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:35,220
They must have hacked the elections
and put their own alien in as president

1098
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,514
so they could set a trap for the Heroics.

1099
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,807
I'm such an idiot.

1100
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,228
President Neil Anami.

1101
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,939
Spell Neil Anami backwards and you have…

1102
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,067
"I'm an alien."

1103
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,154
Everyone thinks that the aliens
only invaded this morning,

1104
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,823
but they've been here for years,

1105
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,117
planning this takeover the whole time.

1106
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,537
And now we're locked in this stupid cell

1107
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,955

-My arm hurts.
-My ears hurt!

1115
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,850
We never should have come.
You led us here.

1116
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,562
You think I wanted to get locked up
in an alien ship?

1117
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:26,896
It was all of us.

1118
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,816
We did it together.

1119
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,192
I wanna go home.

1120
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,069
[Twins in unison] Me too!

1121
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,445
We all want to go home.

1122
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,031
The key is figuring out
how to get out of this room

1123
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,534
so we can make sure
there's a home to go back to.

1124
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:40,618
Wait a second.

1125
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,162
What did you just say?

1126
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,416
-He said we all want to go home.
-Not that, the second part.

1129

1132
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:00,054
maybe it's time to admit
we're never getting out of here.

01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,932
-What?
-I mean, let's get real.

1134
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,352
These walls and this door
must be, like, two-feet thick.

1135
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,187
It's totally impossible.

1136
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,982
-Wow, great attitude.
-[Missy] Yep.

1137
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,568
We're never getting out of here,

1138
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:17,030
and we're certainly never seeing
our parents again, that's for sure.

1139
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:23,578
She's right. Pretty soon
we'll forget what they even look like.

1140
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,288
The way they smelled…

1141
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,624
It'll all just be…

1142
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,000

1143
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,253
Jeez, you guys are really bumming me out.

1144
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,298
But I guess…

1145
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,926
this really is the end.

1148
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,351
maybe my sister didn't hate me.

1149
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,144
I don't hate you.

1150
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,063
[both] I love you.

1151
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:51,981
That love we feel…

1152
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,232
is real.

1153
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,360
And…

1154
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,153
it's that love…

1155
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,697
that'll get us out of here.

1156
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:03,785

It's almost like you want everyone to cry…

1162
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,236

-You should've come to me.
-You?

1169

-Yup.
-Hmm!

1170
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,720
Don't you remember what your generation
was like when we took over?

1171
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:04,887
-Good point.
-Mm-hmm.

1172
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,182
Well, I guess it's up to the kids.

1173
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,977
The next generation is always more…

1174

powerful, more…

1175
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:14,564
Evolved?

1176
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,442
I got it!

1177
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,903
What? You figure a way out of here?

1178
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:25,074
Oh… no. I figured out how to switch on
these security monitors.

1179
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,286
Surprisingly intuitive.

1180
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,579
What?

1181
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,414
At least now we can watch something

1182
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,875
instead of sitting around
yelling at each other.

1183
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,795

1184
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:39,922

-Rewind?
-Fast Forward?

1186
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,302
Are those our children?

1187
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,096
Wheels, how much time do we have?

1188
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,264
Eighteen minutes.

1189
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,850
Then we need to hurry
if we want to stop the takeover.

1190
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,852
Us? Are you nuts?

1191
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:56,022
We have to go free our parents
and let them handle it.

1192
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:59,192
No! There's no time for that!
By the time we get there, they--

If Little Miss No-Powers
is who you want as a leader,

1197
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,995
fine, follow her straight into Alienville.

1198

are gonna go get our parents.

-We are?
-Yes. Right now.

1200
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,086

-Some people are just--
-[Wheels] Forget him.

1204
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:32,475
We need to get to the rocket
so I can stop it before it launches.

1205
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,727
How are you so sure you can do that?

1206
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,772
Because everything the aliens build
is super intuitive to use,

1207
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:40,525
almost like it was designed
for children to operate.

1208

Get me close. I'll turn it off.

1209

-We can do this.
-How?

1286
01:08:58,801 --> 01:08:59,802
We work together.

Did you see their teamwork?

1309
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,074
Just like their parents.

[chuckling]

1311
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,833
Okay, Wild Card, spill it.

1312
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,419
What's the big plan, hmm?

1313
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,547
Well, the plan was
to get me close enough to you

1314
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,967
to turn you into the dumbest alien
that ever existed.

1315
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:26,305
No way! My powers finally worked.

1316
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,600
[laughs]

1317
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:35,064
Keep laughing
and I'll blast you right back to Ogima.

1318
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:41,111
We have ways of getting
the truth out of you, you know.

1319
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,529
That'd be a first.

1320
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,741
-Ha!
-[snickering]

1321
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,500
We only have six minutes left!

1322
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,754
Not a problem. Not a problem.

1323
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:01,799
All I have to do is
reprogram the rocket's main contr--

1324
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,056
What is that?

1325
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,309
Maybe it's a…

1326
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:17,815
A force field?

1327
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:20,359
No, no, no, we were so close!

1328
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,195
But there's no one here but us.

1329
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,447
Who did this?

1330
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:27,366
[Ojo] I did.

1331
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:35,958
Ojo, did you just talk?

1332
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:37,960
I could always talk.

1333
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:41,964
I simply chose to observe
and listen instead.

1334
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:44,967
And what I heard was chaos,

1335
01:11:46,176 --> 01:11:47,136
dysfunction,

1336
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:48,929
disharmony…

1337
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,765
just like your parents.

1338
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:53,851
But that's not true.

1339
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,271
We were working together.

1340
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:58,856
Were you?

1341
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,941
Then where's Wild Card?

1342
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,319
That's a good question.

1343
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:04,903
Hey, Wild Card, old buddy.

1344
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:08,991
Are you in the ship's control room yet?

1345
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:10,451
[Wild Card] I sure am.

1346
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:12,786
Just like we planned, old buddy.

1347
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:18,876
Ignore him.

1348
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:20,794
That's some kind of trick.

1349
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,796
I have Wild Card right here.

1350
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:27,384

[screeches]

1354
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:39,980
Wow. I gave this plan
50-to-1 odds at best,

1355
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:43,317
but you fell for it
hook, line, and sinker.

1356
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,986
We got the one
with the useless superpower?

1357
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,490
Got you far away
from the control center, didn't it?

1358
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:53,702
Go to the control center, now!
Go, go. Go! Go!

1359
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:55,537
[groans loudly]

[laughs]

1362
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:02,920
You were working together?

1363
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:04,588
Surprise!

1364
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:07,132
I even sent him on a secret mission.

1365
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,052
Isn't that right, Wild Card?

1366
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:11,178
Yep!

1367
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:14,890
And when the team leader tells you
to do something, you hop to it.

1368
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:17,976
Since when did you accept Missy
as the leader?

1369
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,311
Since the tunnel…

1370
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,898
when she told me you
were an alien spy.

1371
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:25,192
[in unison] Ojo's an alien spy?

1372
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:27,569
Yep. Ojo's a spy.

1373
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:31,740
You knew.

1374
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:34,701
How'd you figure it out?

1375
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,623
You accidentally gave it away
in one of your own drawings.

1376
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:41,750
Your art never lies.

1377
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,878
-[whispers] She's an alien spy.
-Holy… doo doo.

1378
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,467
You work for Granada, don't you?

1379
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,303
Or does Granada work for you?

1380
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,180
They all work for me.

1381
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,434
What the…

1382
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,144
Ojo's an alien!

1383
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:02,104
[all in unison] We know!

1384
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,649
[Wild Card] And now you can be impressed…

1386
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,360
…and defeated…

1387
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:11,738
as soon as I figure out which
button removes the shield.

1388
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:15,826
Knowing the aliens, it's probably a big
button with a picture of a shield on it.

1389
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:16,785
Oh!

1390

[snarling]

1402
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:10,714
We'll hold it off.

1403
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:12,925
You find a way to stop the launch.

1404
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:19,640
[Wheels] Um…

1405
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:22,851

1407
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,231
Then you better hurry!

1408
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,066
Come on, everyone.

1409
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,818
Time to show these guys
what we're made of.

1410
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,987
[snarling, roaring]

1411
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:45,916
Come on in. It's broken.

1412
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,543
I mean it's open.

1413
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:52,005
[Missy] Wild Card,
you have to keep those shields down.

1414
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:53,257
Don't worry, Missy.

1415
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:54,883
I'm on it.

1416
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,093
Oh yeah?

1417
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:58,136
What are you gonna do, hmm?

1418
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,055
Turn into a bowling ball?

1419
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:01,014
Sure…

1420
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:03,642
if that's what I want.

1421
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,352
I can control my powers now.

1422
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:07,354
Working with Missy helped me realize

1423
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:09,940
I was so busy
trying to prove everyone else wrong

1424
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:13,110
when I should have been concentrating
on proving myself right.

1425
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:14,695
She believed in me.

1426
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,738
Now I believe in myself.

1427
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:19,491
Oh, right.

1428
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,952
And you think that's enough.

1429
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:24,204
[mockingly] Believing in yourself.

1430
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:26,456
You tell me.

1431
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:30,877
