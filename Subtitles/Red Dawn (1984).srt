2
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,520
SEPTEMBER

3
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:53,590
Thanks for the ride.

4
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:56,097
Get going.
You don't have time for breakfast.

5
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:57,759
Are you working or what?

6
00:02:57,835 --> 00:03:01,134
Yeah, I'll be at the station all day,
so hitch a ride home.

7
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:04,664
- You got practice today?
- After that, man, we're on double time.

8
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:07,941
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You'd think they'd take it down.

9
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:11,575
Come on, bud.
You lost a football game once yourself.

10
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:13,643
What? I don't remember.

11
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:15,712
I do.

12
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,724
I think you're lying.

13
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:20,728
- I don't know when to believe your mouth.
- Likewise.

14
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:27,902
- Later, bud.
- See you, Jed.

15
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:31,100
- Did you do your history?
- Yeah. Some of it.

16
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:33,804
The Great Hunt would always begin...

17
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,007
with the armies spread out
in a semicircle...

18
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,143
I would say about
the size of Rhode Island.

19
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,519
Then they would ride forward...

20
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,684
driving everything before them:

21
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,890
beasts, men... even bugs.

22
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:56,168
Now the ends would kind of close
in to form a shrinking circle.

23
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,801
And everything within that circle
panicked to get out.

24
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:02,745
When the Mongols could see each other...

25
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:06,581
they had worked themselves up
into a pretty good frenzy.

26
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:11,253
Now when this killing started...

27
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:15,091
it'd last for days, weeks...

28
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:16,960
even months.

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,195
And it went on...

30
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,263
until the young son of the Khan...

31
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:28,209
asked his father
that the last creature alive...

32
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:35,918
be allowed to...

33
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:37,957
go free.

34
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:41,486
well now, my friend.

35
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:44,997
- well, now.
- They're all over!

36
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,729
- Check it out.
- all right!

37
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,735
They look pretty cool, though.

38
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:55,744
I would say they were
way off course.

39
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:59,613
This is very unusual.

40
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:03,518
Better do something, Mr. Teasdale.

41
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:25,047
What's going on, my friend?

42
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:51,771
Come on!
Let's go!

43
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:26,350
Get in!

44
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:28,256
Get down! Get down!

45
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:32,591
- Get in!
- Wait!

46
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:43,039
Run! Get in!

47
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:58,433
Dad!

48
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:00,529
What's happening?
What's happening?

49
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:03,804
- They're shooting at everybody!
- Shooting?

50
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:10,382
- We're going to the mountains.
- Can you tell who they are?

51
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:12,943
I heard some of them
speaking Spanish, Mr. Morris.

52
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:15,320
Did you see any of them?

53
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:20,396
Oh, my God.

54
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:24,130
Boys...

55
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,639
get in there and get
sleeping bags and food right now.

56
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,039
Come on.
Hurry up, boys.

57
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,236
Come on, son.

58
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:36,079
- Take the dry stuff.
- Get the dehydrated stuff.

59
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:38,518
Get plenty of Kleenex.

60
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:40,919
- Get some lanterns.
- .38 Specials.

61
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,823
Grab some toilet paper.
I ain't gonna use no leaves.

62
00:08:43,893 --> 00:08:45,952
Bring a lot of that.

63
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,792
Be sure to take
a lot of batteries.

64
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:55,700
Get a shotgun.

65
00:08:55,774 --> 00:08:57,708
Get those down jackets.

66
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:00,205
Matt, look!

67
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:03,181
Get down! Get down!

68
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:06,581
Lay down.

69
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:13,728
Is it ours?

70
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,634
Son, I love you.

71
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:21,933
I love you, Dad.
Tell Mom I love her.

72
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:25,966
- I'll take care of him.
- Boys, just get out of here.

73
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:28,479
And don't come back here.

74
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:30,982
No matter what you see or hear,
don't come back.

75
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,485
I'll come and get you soon enough.

76
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:42,429
Open the glove compartment.

77
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:47,362
- Is it there?
- Yeah.

78
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:49,133
Load it.

79
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:55,840
- It's already loaded.
- Give it here.

80
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:00,676
- Want these also, Jed?
- Put them in my pocket.

81
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:09,430
Jesus Christ.

82
00:10:09,498 --> 00:10:11,329
Oh, Jesus, Jesus.

83
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:14,031
I'm gonna turn off.

84
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,089
It's a helicopter!

85
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:48,808
It's ours!

86
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,911
Get in! Get in!

87
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:08,764
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

88
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:12,365
Only thing is, we got one problem.
We don't have any water.

89
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:15,411
How about pissing in it?

90
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:22,847
- That's a good idea.
- How do you know it'll work?

91
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:25,288
- How old are you, kid?
- Fifteen.

92
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:27,792
And the name's Danny, not " kid."

93
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:31,888
well, when you grow up,
you'll know these things, Danny.

94
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:34,730
Now get up here
and piss in the radiator.

95
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:40,841
We've got Yankee Tanks
coming in from the plains.

96
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:43,045
We've lost most of our night vision...

97
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,578
and have only a few
antitank missiles left.

98
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:50,651
Put your best men into hunter groups
armed with RPG's.

99
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,666
Have your men dig holes
100 meters apart.

100
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:58,136
Wait until the Yankees
approach to strike...

101
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:04,111
then attack them in force.

102
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:05,612
Yes, Colonel Bella.

103
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,075
I want some antitank here.

104
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:11,484
We're working on it, sir.

105
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:14,457
This...this is a madhouse!

106
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:16,255
Do you want to see me?

107
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:20,731
Yes...yes.
Go to the sporting goods store.

108
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,169
From the files, obtain form 4473.

109
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:28,766
These will contain
descriptions of weapons...

110
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:31,311
and lists of private ownership.

111
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:42,047
But our families, huh?
What about them, huh?

112
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:46,157
We gotta stay up here
and hide awhile.

113
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:50,030
I just want to go home.

114
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:53,368
I don't want to hide.
If I hide, they'll never find me.

115
00:13:59,848 --> 00:14:01,406
Check it out.

116
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:04,384
Stopped a bullet
that would have hit somebody.

117
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:07,685
I got these.

118
00:14:07,758 --> 00:14:11,592
Those will do us a lot of good.
We've got no radio.

119
00:14:11,663 --> 00:14:14,496
How long do you think we can survive
on olives and Rice Krispies?

120
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:17,769
What else are we gonna do?

121
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:24,975
As Calumet Student Body President...

122
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:27,742
I forward the motion
that we give ourselves up.

123
00:14:27,815 --> 00:14:29,840
I second the motion.

124
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:32,113
We can't stay here.
We need stuff and--

125
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:33,415
Sit down, Danny.

126
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:39,559
It's too dangerous
to go into town.

127
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,497
- I say we vote on it.
- No.

128
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:46,367
It isn't the big game, Mr. Quarterback.
He can go wherever he wants.

129
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:49,666
You're such a goddamn jock.

130
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:54,480
Come on, guys!
Knock it off!

131
00:14:57,485 --> 00:15:00,545
If you want to go so bad,
take your shit!

132
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:03,682
That goes for the rest of you.

133
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:06,762
Get walking.

134
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:10,393
It's World War III down there.

135
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:13,335
People are being killed.

136
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:17,608
Those could be Russians.

137
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:22,342
Jed, what about your family?

138
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:32,186
I don't know.

139
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:34,559
But I'm alive.

140
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:39,330
And I'm staying here.
My family would want me to stay alive.

141
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:41,964
Your family would
want you to stay alive.

142
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:48,077
You think you're so smart, man,
but you're just a bunch of scared kids.

143
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:53,944
What do you think you are?

144
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:58,221
Alone, I guess.

145
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,891
No, you're not.

146
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:06,168
Hey, bud.

147
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:11,038
What do you say?

148
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:26,159
I'm with you.

149
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:33,360
Now the rest of you get going.

150
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:42,613
all right, but if you stay...

151
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:45,650
you're gonna do
exactly what I say, okay?

152
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:53,555
So come on over here
and get warm.

153
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:55,724
Daryl.

154
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,611
I'm sorry.

155
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,047
Me too, man.

156
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:24,287
Matt and I have been coming up to these
mountains with our dad our whole lives.

157
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:28,700
We can hunt, we can fish.
We can stay up here a long, long time.

158
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:32,607
How long, Jed?

159
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:39,012
Until we don't hear that no more.

160
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:42,147
OCTOBER

161
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:55,094
I got him!

162
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:58,435
You got him.

163
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:07,644
He's still breathing!

164
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,984
Never shoot twice.
If you shoot twice, they can find you.

165
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,058
- He's dead anyway.
- How do you know?

166
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:23,865
I used to read a lot about
Jedediah Smith and Jim Bridger.

167
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:29,006
The Blackfeet, if you shot twice,
would know right where you were.

168
00:18:29,846 --> 00:18:32,110
My dad named me after Jed Smith.

169
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,654
This is your first time, isn't it?

170
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:40,658
Yeah. Why?

171
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:43,661
You gotta drink if it's your first.
We did.

172
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:46,698
What's it taste like?

173
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:48,792
It's not too bad.

174
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:52,270
It's kind of salty, like a steak
or when you get a nosebleed.

175
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,208
You gotta do it, Robert.
It's the spirit of the deer.

176
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:02,948
When you drink it,
you'll be a real hunter.

177
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:09,121
Bottoms up.

178
00:19:12,032 --> 00:19:13,693
Go. Go ahead.

179
00:19:17,905 --> 00:19:20,533
Go for it, buddy.

180
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:23,803
All right! All right!

181
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:27,282
You did it.

182
00:19:28,785 --> 00:19:31,879
His blood is yours.
My dad said that once you do that...

183
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:35,892
there's gonna be something
different about you... always.

184
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,064
It wasn't so bad.

185
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:47,406
It wasn't that bad.

186
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:52,443
It wasn't so bad.

187
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,984
That's the last of it,
except for the olives.

188
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:05,620
We still got
plenty of meat left.

189
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:07,164
Just stuff you shot.

190
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:10,201
So tell me, dork, where do you suppose
hamburgers come from?

191
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,760
Nobody shoots them.

192
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:13,499
We need food.

193
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:16,809
We need to know.

194
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:21,444
We do.

195
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:28,958
We'll go into town.

196
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:00,726
There's no one here, either.

197
00:21:03,068 --> 00:21:05,593
Looks like it's been here
for a thousand years.

198
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,771
Come on.

199
00:21:26,363 --> 00:21:28,388
The stores are open.

200
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:30,730
There's people everywhere!
Maybe it's over!

201
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:34,871
- Don't go anywhere.
- Those aren't our troops.

202
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,431
You can't tell from here, Jed.

203
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:42,881
What is that? I've never seen
a tank like that before.

204
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,942
Yeah, but they're packed.
That means something.

205
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:50,151
Let's stash our stuff.
Leave it all here.

206
00:21:54,932 --> 00:21:57,457
That's the Mayor's car.

207
00:21:57,534 --> 00:22:01,664
- They got Daryl's dad's car.
- Look at the size of that tank.

208
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:10,642
Lewis. Lewis, how you doing?

209
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:16,883
Was he scared of us?

210
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:37,641
Hey, let's ask Alicia.
She'll know.

211
00:22:49,164 --> 00:22:51,155
Six toothbrushes, please.

212
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:55,670
- Jed!
- How's your sister?

213
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,641
- Where did you come from?
- We've been hiding in the mountains.

214
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,235
Are you crazy?
You gotta get out of here.

215
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:05,113
We will, but first we gotta
find out what's going--

216
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:12,857
They know who all of you are.
They're looking for you.

217
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:14,986
- Who?
- The KGB.

218
00:23:15,063 --> 00:23:17,463
- The Russians?
- And the Cubans.

219
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:22,434
Look, have you seen my father?

220
00:23:22,506 --> 00:23:25,441
I called, there was no answer.
The station was empty.

221
00:23:27,912 --> 00:23:29,539
Okay, listen.

222
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:33,244
I'm gonna tell you something
nobody's supposed to talk about, but--

223
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,308
But what?

224
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:39,356
But they took a lot of people away,
people they thought would make trouble.

225
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:42,419
people who had guns or things
they wanted, they just took them away.

226
00:23:42,497 --> 00:23:43,395
Where?

227
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:47,060
Reeducation camps.
That's what they call it.

228
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:50,435
The drive-in.
I heard they took a lot of people to--

229
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:54,010
I pray for you.

230
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:57,644
America is a whorehouse...

231
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:00,651
where the revolutionary ideals
of your forefathers...

232
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,316
are corrupted and sold in alleys
by vendors of capitalism.

233
00:24:34,594 --> 00:24:37,290
Could you find my dad, Tom Eckert?
I'm Jed.

234
00:24:37,364 --> 00:24:39,628
Jed? Matt?

235
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:41,134
Mr. Barnes?

236
00:24:42,537 --> 00:24:45,131
I'll go find your dad.
I know right where he is.

237
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,843
You know Morris' Market
out on the highway?

238
00:24:49,913 --> 00:24:52,006
Can you see if Mr. Morris
is in there too?

239
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,517
I'll look around for him too, son.

240
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:14,769
Daddy?

241
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:20,750
I can stand up.

242
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:22,080
Boys.

243
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:36,066
Don't talk. Don't say anything.
Let me look at you.

244
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:41,941
well, I knew I was right.
I knew it.

245
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,944
You're alive.

246
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:46,982
I was tough on both of you.

247
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:51,913
And I did things that made you--

248
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:53,923
that made you hate me sometimes.

249
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:57,386
But you understand now,
don't you?

250
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:02,663
What happened, Dad?
Why are you here? What did they do?

251
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:05,905
It doesn't matter.

252
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,709
One way or another...

253
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:13,471
for one reason or another,
we're all gone.

254
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:16,279
It's all gone.

255
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:20,488
Remember...

256
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,295
remember when you used to go
in the park and play...

257
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:29,662
and I used to
put you on the swings...

258
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:32,068
and both of you were...

259
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,700
so damn little?

260
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:43,649
I remember.
I remember all of it.

261
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:46,620
I ain't gonna be around
to pick you up when you fall now.

262
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,022
Both of you got to
take care of each other now.

263
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:53,624
We'll never see you again, Dad.

264
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:56,223
Yes, you will.
I don't want to hear that, Mattie.

265
00:26:57,136 --> 00:27:00,333
What happened to Mom, Dad?
Where is she?

266
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,253
We can't afford
to be crying anymore.

267
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,592
I don't want either one of you
to ever cry for me again.

268
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:23,065
Don't ever do it
not as long as you live.

269
00:27:23,902 --> 00:27:25,836
Where's my dad, Mr. Eckert?

270
00:27:28,574 --> 00:27:30,337
I don't know, son.

271
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:32,844
I don't know.

272
00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:37,713
You all get going now.

273
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:40,414
Get out before they find you.

274
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,123
I love you.

275
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,038
I know you do, son.
I love you too.

276
00:28:12,294 --> 00:28:13,727
Boys!

277
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:17,864
Avenge me!

278
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:44,128
I'll be damned.
Get in here.

279
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:47,136
Mr. Mason, how are you doing?
Good to see you.

280
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:53,740
We got us some outlaws here.

281
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:58,145
Wow, a house.

282
00:28:58,218 --> 00:29:00,015
Go on and find a chair.

283
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:03,022
Last time we were in a house
was five weeks.

284
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:04,524
You look it.

285
00:29:09,866 --> 00:29:11,925
Who you got out there with you?

286
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,333
We got Danny, we got Daryl.

287
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,471
We all figured you boys
had headed for F.A. by now.

288
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:20,738
What's F.A.?

289
00:29:20,812 --> 00:29:23,042
Free America.
That's the safe zone.

290
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:24,174
Where are we?

291
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,414
Hell, you boys is in
occupied territory.

292
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:30,753
You're 40 miles
behind the enemy lines.

293
00:29:30,824 --> 00:29:33,987
Right smack dab
in the middle of World War III.

294
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,996
What are you boys doing
fooling around town anyway?

295
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,539
We've been looking for news,
Mr. Mason.

296
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:47,168
We haven't even seen or talked
to anybody since it all started.

297
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,113
Wait here just a minute.

298
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,586
I wish there was more.

299
00:29:57,658 --> 00:29:58,750
I'm sorry.

300
00:29:58,826 --> 00:30:01,420
Thank you, Mrs. Mason.
We really appreciate it.

301
00:30:08,304 --> 00:30:10,238
This'll keep you boys warm.

302
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:13,635
Use this to see
where you're standing.

303
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,639
A radio?
We can't take this.

304
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:23,180
That's all right.
I got another one.

305
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,916
You boys listen to me.

306
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:28,825
- Don't go to Calumet no more.
- How come?

307
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:32,332
Because there's been
some attacks up there.

308
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:35,962
people waking up
with their throats cut.

309
00:30:37,707 --> 00:30:39,299
Word has it, it's you.

310
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:50,120
What happened to my dad and mom?

311
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,521
Your daddy's dead, Robert.

312
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,662
They shot him.

313
00:30:58,031 --> 00:31:00,499
Russians found some guns missing...

314
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,503
so they shot him
for aiding guerrillas.

315
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,603
What do you mean, aiding guerrillas?
He never aided anybody.

316
00:31:08,678 --> 00:31:11,806
- We took the stuff!
- We killed him!

317
00:31:11,883 --> 00:31:13,851
They killed him, son.

318
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:16,716
Made him an example.

319
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:20,315
Now you boys listen to me
and let that burn in real good.

320
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:24,629
I don't know where
your mother is, Robert.

321
00:31:24,698 --> 00:31:26,165
I got nobody now.

322
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:30,192
If you boys need food, a bed,
anything, you come here.

323
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:39,737
I got a couple of heirlooms
I want to hide with you.

324
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:41,249
Jack, no.

325
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:51,156
My granddaughters.

326
00:31:51,231 --> 00:31:54,359
They spent two days
sneaking here.

327
00:31:55,469 --> 00:31:58,029
Those sons-of-bitches
tried having their way with them.

328
00:32:02,978 --> 00:32:03,842
Toni...

329
00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:05,676
Erica.

330
00:32:05,748 --> 00:32:08,876
This is Matt and Jed Eckert.
They're gonna take care of you.

331
00:32:11,088 --> 00:32:13,682
And I don't wanna know
where they're going.

332
00:32:14,926 --> 00:32:16,518
Bye, Grandpa.

333
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:34,372
Good luck, son.

334
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:38,979
Here. Here's a box of ammo
for your granddaddy's pistol.

335
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:41,217
- Thanks.
- Good luck to you.

336
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,817
I'll take care of them.
Don't worry.

337
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:59,408
It's 11:59 at Radio Free America.

338
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:02,177
This is Uncle Sam with
music and the truth until dawn.

339
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:04,913
We've got a few words for some
of our brothers and sisters...

340
00:33:04,988 --> 00:33:06,979
in the occupied zone.

341
00:33:07,057 --> 00:33:10,458
The chair is against the wall.
The chair is against the wall.

342
00:33:10,528 --> 00:33:14,555
John has a long mustache.
John has a long mustache.

343
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:17,158
It's 12:00,
another day closer to victory.

344
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:20,330
For all of you out there
on or behind the lines...

345
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:22,637
this is your song.

346
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:48,598
Things are different now.

347
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:11,601
They're coming up.

348
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,474
Let's go tell the others.

349
00:34:31,193 --> 00:34:33,127
Oh, how beautiful.

350
00:34:45,211 --> 00:34:47,372
What is written here?

351
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:51,475
You studied English. Translate.

352
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:55,288
American history...
I know this well.

353
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:02,128
Arapaho National Battlefield.

354
00:35:02,198 --> 00:35:05,395
Here was a great peasant uprising...

355
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:09,929
in 1908 of wild Indians.

356
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:13,876
They were crushed by
President Theodore Roosevelt...

357
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:19,009
leading imperialist armies
and cowboys.

358
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:23,920
The battle lasted all winter.
More than 35,000 were killed.

359
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:28,428
It was the greatest battle
of the American West.

360
00:35:28,497 --> 00:35:30,431
Bravo!

361
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,663
Yuri, stay here.
I'll take a photo of you.

362
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:40,634
African baboon.

363
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,447
Now you.

364
00:35:45,618 --> 00:35:47,552
Come here, my friend.

365
00:35:51,392 --> 00:35:53,451
Hurry up, you fool.

366
00:36:05,476 --> 00:36:07,410
Look at me, Yuri.

367
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:16,948
Look. Look what I've found.
An arrow.

368
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,787
An Indian arrow.

369
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:21,487
What a philosopher you are.

370
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:24,031
I did not know
the Indians used steel.

371
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,762
Sure, you fool. They used the melted
sabers of Federalist Cossacks.

372
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:31,830
Did these Indians
work in plastic, too?

373
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:35,708
You idiot. This is bone,
polished to a high sheen.

374
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,873
There must be more.

375
00:36:41,654 --> 00:36:42,746
Look.

376
00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:50,192
Watch out! She has a weapon.

377
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,534
Stop, damn it!

378
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:00,133
Quickly, catch him!

379
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:09,719
Take cover!

380
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,390
Stop!

381
00:37:20,902 --> 00:37:22,870
Help me, comrades.

382
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,440
Grab him!

383
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:28,340
I got him!

384
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:30,335
I'm dying.

385
00:38:31,088 --> 00:38:33,079
God help me!

386
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:34,819
God help me!

387
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:18,645
They were people.

388
00:39:18,713 --> 00:39:21,011
Yeah, well, so was my dad.

389
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:24,719
What was it like?

390
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:29,786
It was good.

391
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:35,731
One thing is for sure now.

392
00:39:36,802 --> 00:39:39,100
No one can ever
go home again.

393
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:41,071
Never.

394
00:39:45,212 --> 00:39:47,476
Why don't you
make yourself useful?

395
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:49,540
You wash it!

396
00:39:49,618 --> 00:39:53,918
We ain't never doing your washing again.
Me and her is as good as any of you.

397
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,423
So what's up your ass?

398
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:57,221
Shut up!

399
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:01,162
Don't you ever say that again!

400
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,860
Hear me?
You say that again, I'll kill you.

401
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:05,699
Hear me?

402
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,363
I'll kill you.

403
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,244
So what did I do?

404
00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:15,714
What you said was wrong.

405
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:02,198
From now on...

406
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:07,606
all troops
are forbidden to travel...

407
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,979
outside secured areas...

408
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:14,680
in any group
smaller than squad size.

409
00:41:16,124 --> 00:41:18,217
Then call Bratchenko.

410
00:41:18,294 --> 00:41:24,392
Tell him Sector Eight is now active.

411
00:41:24,468 --> 00:41:26,095
Right away, Colonel Bella.

412
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,333
And I want some interrogations made...

413
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:31,637
starting with the Mayor.

414
00:41:32,778 --> 00:41:36,509
I'm sick of his...pleasantries.

415
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:38,574
Consider it done.

416
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:43,488
Daryl, he wouldn't hurt a fly.

417
00:41:43,558 --> 00:41:45,651
I know my son, Colonel.

418
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:47,957
He's not the guerrilla type.

419
00:41:48,031 --> 00:41:50,022
According to records, Mayor...

420
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:54,092
your son is a prominent
student leader.

421
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:58,608
Ahh, yes, well, he's a leader,
but not in a violent or physical way.

422
00:41:58,677 --> 00:42:03,239
No, you see, Daryl, he's more of
a politician, like his father.

423
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:08,878
A member of an elite
paramilitary organization:

424
00:42:08,955 --> 00:42:10,388
Eagle Scout.

425
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:13,359
Yes, but that's not military.

426
00:42:13,428 --> 00:42:16,090
If he's alive,
he's scared, he's hungry...

427
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:18,793
and he's just as anxious
to avoid conflicts as you and me.

428
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:20,301
He's not a troublemaker.

429
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,667
Then who is?

430
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,511
Well, let's just say
it runs in some of the families.

431
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:34,443
This community is indeed fortunate
to have a shepherd like him.

432
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:43,325
well, I just want to see
this thing through, Colonel.

433
00:42:43,398 --> 00:42:46,196
If you have any more problems,
you call me--

434
00:42:46,268 --> 00:42:47,166
Thank you.

435
00:42:49,506 --> 00:42:51,269
We're finished...

436
00:42:52,509 --> 00:42:53,942
for now.

437
00:44:33,233 --> 00:44:36,168
Oh, beautiful

438
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:38,728
For spacious skies

439
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:42,903
For amber waves of grain

440
00:44:42,979 --> 00:44:48,315
For purple mountains majesty

441
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:52,617
Above the fruited plain

442
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,954
America--

443
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:34,674
Don't cry!

444
00:45:34,742 --> 00:45:36,676
Hold it back!

445
00:45:39,715 --> 00:45:41,979
Let it turn to something else.

446
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,456
Just let it turn to
something else, okay?

447
00:45:53,966 --> 00:45:55,900
Listen to me. Listen.

448
00:45:57,036 --> 00:46:00,904
Don't you ever cry again
as long as you live.

449
00:46:00,975 --> 00:46:03,273
As long as you live,
never do it.

450
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:04,936
Do you hear me?

451
00:46:15,292 --> 00:46:17,283
They're gonna kill us!

452
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:19,124
All of us!

453
00:46:19,197 --> 00:46:21,791
So why should we be different?

454
00:46:27,574 --> 00:46:30,270
Let it turn to
something else, Mattie.

455
00:46:30,343 --> 00:46:32,868
Let it turn.
Let it turn.

456
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:03,874
Take gasoline.

457
00:47:10,325 --> 00:47:13,419
Hey, girl,
what are you doing here?

458
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:16,090
Hey, beautiful,
where are you going?

459
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:20,169
Forget the broad,
just get her stuff.

460
00:47:24,377 --> 00:47:26,538
Where are you going?

461
00:47:26,612 --> 00:47:30,070
You're so beautiful.
Wait, what's wrong with you?

462
00:47:40,296 --> 00:47:41,729
Let's get her!

463
00:48:05,127 --> 00:48:06,924
Run! This way!

464
00:48:44,808 --> 00:48:46,571
Wolverines!

465
00:48:50,248 --> 00:48:52,341
It's cut...it's cut!

466
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:52,626
I've seen this before.

467
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:55,060
I've seen this before.

468
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:58,556
Nicaragua, San Salvador...

469
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:02,797
Cambodia, Angola, and Mexico.

470
00:50:04,072 --> 00:50:06,370
But these are my men!

471
00:50:20,259 --> 00:50:22,750
Miss, maybe you speak at me
for a minute.

472
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:26,526
- I'll be right back, okay?
- You bring girlfriend?

473
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,296
Okay, I be right here. Bye.

474
00:50:31,106 --> 00:50:33,267
What is a " Wolverine" ?

475
00:50:33,342 --> 00:50:38,780
A small animal...like a badger,
but terribly ferocious.

476
00:50:38,848 --> 00:50:43,615
It is also the name of the local
school sports collective.

477
00:50:43,688 --> 00:50:45,417
They're beasts, Ernesto.

478
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:49,517
You must kill
every one of them eventually.

479
00:50:49,595 --> 00:50:53,190
It's the same as Afghanistan.

480
00:50:53,267 --> 00:50:55,667
They'll never stop.

481
00:50:55,736 --> 00:51:00,764
Look...I was always
on the side of the insurgents.

482
00:51:00,842 --> 00:51:03,504
I have no experience
in these matters.

483
00:51:03,579 --> 00:51:08,414
But it would seem necessary
to win the support of the people.

484
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:12,421
As our opponents
used to say in Vietnam:

485
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:15,516
"Win their hearts and minds."

486
00:51:15,594 --> 00:51:17,960
And they lost, Ernesto.

487
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:19,793
Of course, General.

488
00:51:19,866 --> 00:51:23,996
Things are paralyzed
at the front, Ernesto.

489
00:51:24,071 --> 00:51:27,302
Morale is crucial right now.

490
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:30,242
Keep the men in the secured areas.

491
00:51:30,312 --> 00:51:34,214
You'll see how they forget
about these "Wolverines."

492
00:51:37,554 --> 00:51:39,249
Are you all right?

493
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:45,090
- You were saying, comrade?
- Shut up!

494
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:03,847
What's going on here?!

495
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,985
NOVEMBER

496
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,143
You American?

497
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:26,079
Red-blooded.

498
00:53:26,154 --> 00:53:29,089
Yeah, well,
what's the capital of Texas?

499
00:53:29,893 --> 00:53:30,882
Austin.

500
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,326
Wrong, commie!
It's Houston!

501
00:53:33,396 --> 00:53:36,593
Please, darling.
I'm cold.

502
00:53:38,637 --> 00:53:40,901
You've seen too many movies.

503
00:53:48,515 --> 00:53:50,676
Well, are you hungry?

504
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:53,686
I could eat, yeah.

505
00:53:53,755 --> 00:53:56,019
What kind of plane you fly?

506
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,790
well, I did fly an F-15.

507
00:54:06,137 --> 00:54:08,071
I'm an Eagle driver.

508
00:54:14,147 --> 00:54:16,342
Here, take this.

509
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:19,476
I got this off
a dead Russian major.

510
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,154
Major, huh?

511
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:25,622
Well, I guess
it oughta fit on a colonel.

512
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,837
You the honcho, sport?

513
00:54:35,907 --> 00:54:37,932
Who are you?

514
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:40,739
Andrew Tanner,
Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Air Force.

515
00:54:40,813 --> 00:54:43,077
How'd you get yourself
shot down, Colonel?

516
00:54:43,148 --> 00:54:45,673
It was five to one.
I got four.

517
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:53,655
- I'm Jed.
- How you doing, Jed?

518
00:54:53,729 --> 00:54:55,663
Good as can be.

519
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:11,973
West coast... east coast.

520
00:55:12,051 --> 00:55:13,985
Down here is Mexico.

521
00:55:15,122 --> 00:55:17,113
The first wave of the attack...

522
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:21,490
came in disguised as commercial charter
flights, like Afghanistan in '80.

523
00:55:21,562 --> 00:55:24,292
only they were
crack airborne outfits.

524
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:27,267
They took these passes
in the Rockies.

525
00:55:27,336 --> 00:55:29,099
So that's what hit Calumet.

526
00:55:29,172 --> 00:55:31,037
I guess so.

527
00:55:31,107 --> 00:55:34,770
They coordinated with nuke strikes,
using surprisingly accurate missiles.

528
00:55:34,845 --> 00:55:38,611
They took out the silos in the Dakotas
and key points of communication.

529
00:55:38,684 --> 00:55:40,345
Like what?

530
00:55:40,419 --> 00:55:44,082
Oh, like Omaha, Washington,
Kansas City.

531
00:55:44,157 --> 00:55:45,089
Gone?

532
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:47,093
Yeah, that's right.

533
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:50,892
Infiltrators came up illegal
from Mexico.

534
00:55:50,965 --> 00:55:52,557
Cubans, mostly.

535
00:55:52,634 --> 00:55:54,397
They managed to infiltrate...

536
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:57,268
SAC bases in the midwest,
several down in Texas...

537
00:55:57,339 --> 00:55:59,899
and wreaked a hell of a lot of havoc,
I'm here to tell you.

538
00:55:59,976 --> 00:56:03,241
They opened up the door down here...

539
00:56:03,314 --> 00:56:05,680
and the whole Cuban
and Nicaraguan armies...

540
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:08,048
come walking right through...

541
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,486
rolled right up here
through the Great Plains.

542
00:56:10,556 --> 00:56:12,319
How far did they get?

543
00:56:12,392 --> 00:56:14,417
Cheyenne...

544
00:56:14,494 --> 00:56:16,894
across to Kansas.

545
00:56:16,964 --> 00:56:20,422
We held them at the Rockies
and at the Mississippi.

546
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:24,768
Anyway, the Russians reinforced
with 60 divisions.

547
00:56:24,841 --> 00:56:28,470
Sent three whole army groups
across the Bering Strait into Alaska...

548
00:56:28,544 --> 00:56:30,842
cut the pipeline,
came across Canada...

549
00:56:30,914 --> 00:56:34,350
to link up here in the middle,
but we stopped their butt cold.

550
00:56:38,657 --> 00:56:42,286
The lines have
pretty much stabilized now.

551
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,063
What about Europe?

552
00:56:45,132 --> 00:56:47,225
I guess they figured...

553
00:56:48,636 --> 00:56:51,070
twice in one century was enough.

554
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:58,805
They're sitting this one out.
all except England.

555
00:57:00,217 --> 00:57:03,243
And they won't last very long.

556
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,222
The Russians need to take us in one
piece, and that's why they're here now.

557
00:57:07,292 --> 00:57:10,318
That's why they won't use nukes anymore
and we won't either.

558
00:57:10,396 --> 00:57:13,365
The whole damn thing's
pretty conventional now.

559
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:18,528
Who knows?
Maybe next week will be swords.

560
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:20,267
What started it?

561
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:24,607
I don't know.
Two toughest kids on the block, I guess.

562
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,614
Sooner or later,
they're gonna fight.

563
00:57:26,683 --> 00:57:28,674
That simple?

564
00:57:31,022 --> 00:57:33,456
Maybe somebody just
forgot what it was like.

565
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,927
Well, who is on our side?

566
00:57:38,531 --> 00:57:40,931
Six hundred million
screaming Chinamen.

567
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,128
Last I heard, there were
a billion screaming Chinamen.

568
00:57:45,339 --> 00:57:46,601
There were.

569
00:57:52,682 --> 00:57:54,115
You got a family?

570
00:57:58,856 --> 00:58:00,483
I don't know.

571
00:58:03,328 --> 00:58:06,855
They got caught
behind the lines down in Texas.

572
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:12,205
I'd like to think
they're alive, but...

573
00:58:12,272 --> 00:58:15,207
I hear stories about
what they're doing to civilians.

574
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:22,974
Colonel, get up.

575
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,288
We're gonna go shoot up
an armored column.

576
00:58:28,859 --> 00:58:31,123
Let's go.
The early bird gets the worm.

577
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:46,647
Early bird gets the worm.

578
00:59:15,116 --> 00:59:17,243
Watch those claymores in the trees.

579
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:29,093
Matt, RPG!

580
00:59:41,615 --> 00:59:44,641
What do you think?
Not bad for a bunch of kids, huh?

581
00:59:46,321 --> 00:59:48,448
Your mom would be real proud.

582
00:59:54,965 --> 00:59:58,901
You think you're tough
for eating beans every day?

583
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,929
The scarecrows in Denver would give
anything for a taste of what you got.

584
01:00:04,844 --> 01:00:07,779
They've been under siege
for about three months.

585
01:00:09,116 --> 01:00:12,608
They live off rats
and sawdust bread and sometimes...

586
01:00:12,687 --> 01:00:14,655
on each other.

587
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:20,989
At night, the...

588
01:00:21,064 --> 01:00:23,362
pyres for the dead
light up the sky.

589
01:00:26,037 --> 01:00:27,971
It's medieval.

590
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:50,965
All that hate's
gonna burn you up.

591
01:00:52,469 --> 01:00:54,403
It keeps me warm.

592
01:01:06,786 --> 01:01:08,754
Are we doing right?

593
01:01:57,816 --> 01:01:59,841
You made a new friend.

594
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:06,492
She doesn't say much, does she?

595
01:02:09,964 --> 01:02:11,898
Something happened to her.

596
01:02:19,576 --> 01:02:22,238
DECEMBER

597
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:34,688
All right.
Plane, plane, plane, plane.

598
01:02:34,761 --> 01:02:39,198
Cuban bunker, Russian bunker,
munitions dump, troop tents.

599
01:02:39,267 --> 01:02:42,430
Machine gun bunkers
here, here, here and here.

600
01:02:42,504 --> 01:02:46,167
Back here by the drive-in screen
are your political prisoners.

601
01:02:46,242 --> 01:02:48,267
We'll cause a diversion over here...

602
01:02:48,345 --> 01:02:52,441
cut holes in the wire here,
fire on all these machine gun positions.

603
01:02:52,517 --> 01:02:56,351
The B Group comes across this area
in a flanking maneuver...

604
01:02:56,421 --> 01:03:00,687
and when you reach this bunker, you
lay down grazing fire in this defilade.

605
01:03:01,595 --> 01:03:04,155
I think that's pretty simple.

606
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:05,926
Anybody got any questions so far?

607
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,831
What's a flank?

608
01:03:07,902 --> 01:03:09,893
A duffle-A?

609
01:03:10,973 --> 01:03:14,238
- What's grazing fire?
- I need a drink.

610
01:03:15,511 --> 01:03:17,206
Step into the line--

611
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:36,863
Help...the "Wolverines" are attacking.

612
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,371
Follow me...quickly.

613
01:03:41,644 --> 01:03:43,077
Wolverines!

614
01:04:09,944 --> 01:04:11,912
Come on! Here's your chance!

615
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,916
We're all gonna die!
Die standing up!

616
01:04:26,999 --> 01:04:28,261
Grenade!

617
01:05:06,881 --> 01:05:09,543
Children did this.

618
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:11,142
It's rebels.

619
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,280
What rebels? They're bandits.

620
01:05:17,661 --> 01:05:20,789
Every time they shoot,
the revolution grows.

621
01:05:20,866 --> 01:05:23,562
I know. I was a partisan.

622
01:05:24,336 --> 01:05:27,430
And what are you now?

623
01:05:29,142 --> 01:05:31,076
Now I'm like you...

624
01:05:32,312 --> 01:05:34,075
a policeman.

625
01:05:40,156 --> 01:05:41,680
All right, Colonel!

626
01:05:46,998 --> 01:05:50,126
And he's down.
Great play by Matt Eckert.

627
01:05:53,539 --> 01:05:55,803
Huddle up, folks.

628
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:59,470
- That was a pretty big hit.
- You cover Matt this play.

629
01:05:59,546 --> 01:06:01,241
Are you okay?

630
01:06:04,853 --> 01:06:07,014
A little harder
down on the ground, isn't it?

631
01:06:08,223 --> 01:06:10,384
Come on, old man.

632
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,394
Well, you come down here.

633
01:06:17,402 --> 01:06:19,700
How old's your wife?

634
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:22,035
How old's your wife?

635
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:23,665
Eighty.

636
01:06:24,443 --> 01:06:26,001
What's she like?

637
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,377
Old, like me.

638
01:06:28,448 --> 01:06:30,040
What's she really like?

639
01:06:31,652 --> 01:06:34,348
Feisty, like you.

640
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:40,620
Where'd you meet her?

641
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:43,131
You really want to know this stuff?

642
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:47,827
I met her in a closet at a party.

643
01:06:47,906 --> 01:06:50,374
I couldn't stand her at first.

644
01:06:50,442 --> 01:06:52,376
But once it took...

645
01:06:53,479 --> 01:06:55,743
I loved her so bad it hurt.

646
01:06:57,351 --> 01:06:59,615
You still love her like that?

647
01:07:02,457 --> 01:07:04,220
Are you quitters playing or what?

648
01:07:06,462 --> 01:07:07,724
Fine.

649
01:07:08,597 --> 01:07:10,531
Good catch, Robert.

650
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,534
Matt, let's go!

651
01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:16,268
They brought their kids.

652
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:19,832
Said they didn't have food enough
to feed them through the winter.

653
01:07:19,912 --> 01:07:22,813
They want to give them to you, Jed.

654
01:07:22,882 --> 01:07:25,476
This is enough, Mr. Mason.
I don't want any more.

655
01:07:26,686 --> 01:07:30,986
You're a leader now.
They've heard of you on the other side.

656
01:07:31,058 --> 01:07:33,492
Maybe all the way to California.

657
01:07:34,596 --> 01:07:36,530
And there's some that say...

658
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:39,727
they're gonna drop in some Special
Forces in the spring to help you out.

659
01:07:42,139 --> 01:07:43,470
Green Berets.

660
01:07:49,214 --> 01:07:51,648
Spring's a long time away.

661
01:07:53,253 --> 01:07:55,517
It's a lot of talk until then.

662
01:07:56,957 --> 01:07:59,482
JANUARY

663
01:08:22,588 --> 01:08:25,113
It's ours! It's ours!

664
01:08:25,192 --> 01:08:26,557
How can you tell?

665
01:08:27,461 --> 01:08:28,519
It's ours.

666
01:08:36,038 --> 01:08:37,300
Fry 'em.

667
01:09:14,018 --> 01:09:15,451
Jesus.

668
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:20,524
You gotta cross that?

669
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:23,428
Just part of it.

670
01:09:24,464 --> 01:09:26,728
I hope our guys are still there.

671
01:09:30,338 --> 01:09:32,272
So this is the battlefield?

672
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:37,874
It's a real war, kid.
It's here every day.

673
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,642
Come with me, Jed.

674
01:09:44,122 --> 01:09:46,056
You can quit now.

675
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,887
Could you?

676
01:09:49,962 --> 01:09:52,021
Don't give me that crap.

677
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,634
Wake up in the morning...

678
01:09:55,703 --> 01:09:57,364
grow old.

679
01:10:02,511 --> 01:10:04,672
Move it!
Come on! Let's go!

680
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:16,352
Get down!
Down! Down! Down!

681
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:28,475
Stay down! He can't see us!

682
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:52,800
He's looking for us!

683
01:10:55,075 --> 01:10:56,508
He sure is.

684
01:11:02,084 --> 01:11:05,212
I can't stand it!
I can't stand it!

685
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:08,021
Get down!

686
01:11:08,091 --> 01:11:10,025
Shut up!

687
01:11:24,545 --> 01:11:26,877
Run! Everybody get outta here!

688
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,577
What are you doing?
Goddammit!

689
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:35,451
I'm going up there!

690
01:11:45,471 --> 01:11:46,904
I got it!

691
01:11:48,174 --> 01:11:51,075
Get outta here, kid!
There's a world of hurt coming down!

692
01:11:51,144 --> 01:11:53,078
I'm staying with you, Colonel!

693
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,454
Take him out with your RPG!

694
01:12:00,522 --> 01:12:03,889
- It won't launch!
- Get another rocket!

695
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,498
Give me another rocket!

696
01:12:19,346 --> 01:12:20,472
Aardvark!

697
01:12:29,659 --> 01:12:31,251
Eat me!

698
01:12:56,591 --> 01:12:59,116
Come on, buddies!
Come and get 'em!

699
01:13:01,064 --> 01:13:04,431
Shoot straight, for once...

700
01:13:04,501 --> 01:13:07,902
you Army...pukes.

701
01:13:12,712 --> 01:13:15,647
It's useless! He's dead!
Let's go!

702
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,666
I'll never love anybody.

703
01:14:00,737 --> 01:14:03,934
I'll never love anybody again.

704
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:08,936
If you didn't love anybody,
you'd never even be here.

705
01:14:15,088 --> 01:14:17,113
Where we gonna bury him?

706
01:14:18,192 --> 01:14:20,387
There's not much left to bury.

707
01:14:26,536 --> 01:14:29,027
These were good friends.

708
01:14:29,105 --> 01:14:32,233
Take them away from here...

709
01:14:32,309 --> 01:14:34,903
someplace safe...

710
01:14:34,979 --> 01:14:37,573
where this world's never happened.

711
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:41,619
And as we remember...

712
01:14:42,721 --> 01:14:45,281
please let them forget, O Lord...

713
01:14:49,564 --> 01:14:51,964
so they can be little again.

714
01:15:07,919 --> 01:15:10,285
What are you whispering for?

715
01:15:10,356 --> 01:15:12,756
It feels quiet.

716
01:15:12,825 --> 01:15:15,817
You should get some sleep.
It's getting late.

717
01:15:15,896 --> 01:15:17,261
I'm okay.

718
01:15:24,073 --> 01:15:26,007
It's kind of strange, isn't it?

719
01:15:26,075 --> 01:15:28,805
How the mountains
pay us no attention at all.

720
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,848
You laugh or you cry...

721
01:15:31,916 --> 01:15:34,476
the wind just keeps on blowing.

722
01:15:39,893 --> 01:15:42,453
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

723
01:15:43,596 --> 01:15:46,360
You're getting pretty lean
on feelings, aren't you?

724
01:15:46,433 --> 01:15:48,526
I can't afford them.

725
01:15:48,603 --> 01:15:50,935
Even if that had been me?

726
01:15:54,944 --> 01:15:57,310
I was talking to the group, Jed.

727
01:15:57,381 --> 01:15:59,815
It doesn't look good.
They're all talking about quitting.

728
01:15:59,883 --> 01:16:03,944
It seems like they lost stomach for it,
except for Robert.

729
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:07,619
And you?

730
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:11,094
I'm your brother.
Just make it count.

731
01:16:15,303 --> 01:16:17,965
FEBRUARY

732
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:17,505
Attention!

733
01:17:28,826 --> 01:17:31,158
Be seated, comrades.

734
01:17:37,837 --> 01:17:40,465
What I despise most about warfare...

735
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:43,134
is the hypocrisy it often breeds.

736
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:46,873
I've heard euphemisms
that we are containing the enemy...

737
01:17:46,948 --> 01:17:50,884
that our sector
of pacification is growing.

738
01:17:51,688 --> 01:17:53,815
These are the tactics of the lie.

739
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:57,485
Lies have the stench
of death and defeat.

740
01:18:00,465 --> 01:18:03,263
You can only win a war...

741
01:18:03,335 --> 01:18:06,566
by exterminating the enemy.

742
01:18:08,275 --> 01:18:10,869
Do you know who we are fighting?

743
01:18:13,214 --> 01:18:16,308
We are fighting Wolverines...

744
01:18:17,553 --> 01:18:20,488
small, ferocious animals.

745
01:18:21,524 --> 01:18:24,584
For them, you need a hunter.

746
01:18:24,661 --> 01:18:27,027
And you know...

747
01:18:27,098 --> 01:18:28,861
I am a hunter.

748
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,638
From this moment on...

749
01:18:36,709 --> 01:18:41,476
there will be no further reprisals
against civilians.

750
01:18:41,548 --> 01:18:43,573
This was stupid.

751
01:18:46,287 --> 01:18:48,312
Impotence.

752
01:18:51,862 --> 01:18:53,693
Comrades...

753
01:18:53,764 --> 01:18:57,791
if a fox stole your chickens...

754
01:18:57,869 --> 01:19:02,397
would you slaughter your pig
because he saw the fox? No.

755
01:19:04,209 --> 01:19:06,473
You would hunt the fox...

756
01:19:06,546 --> 01:19:11,313
find where it lives and destroy it!

757
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:17,959
And how do we do this?

758
01:19:20,263 --> 01:19:22,493
Become a fox.

759
01:21:43,572 --> 01:21:46,234
Danny, your bolt's open.
It's jammed.

760
01:21:57,189 --> 01:21:59,123
So what if he does?
You don't.

761
01:21:59,192 --> 01:22:01,126
We'd better get out of here.

762
01:22:02,228 --> 01:22:03,490
Shoot him!

763
01:22:03,564 --> 01:22:06,556
- What is this thing?
- What is it?

764
01:22:06,634 --> 01:22:09,330
Who's coming after us?
Where are they?

765
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,306
Rub a butt on him.

766
01:22:15,778 --> 01:22:18,042
Suck at you!
Goddamn for your mother!

767
01:22:18,115 --> 01:22:22,381
I hear a chopper,
and I'm going to blow your brains out.

768
01:22:22,453 --> 01:22:25,149
Go die, Yankee. Die.

769
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:28,851
Gorsky, Stepan Yevgenyvitch.

770
01:22:28,927 --> 01:22:31,418
No one gives a damn who you are!

771
01:22:31,498 --> 01:22:33,398
- They're gonna hurt him!
- Good!

772
01:22:33,466 --> 01:22:35,331
Hey! Look!

773
01:22:36,303 --> 01:22:39,966
This thing's got an arrow.
It's pointing.

774
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:41,475
Where?

775
01:22:43,813 --> 01:22:45,838
Right here.

776
01:23:04,405 --> 01:23:06,100
Where is it?

777
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:08,937
Where is it?

778
01:23:09,778 --> 01:23:11,871
Goddammit, where's the bug?

779
01:23:11,947 --> 01:23:15,314
- They made me swallow it.
- Daryl, what have you done?

780
01:23:15,385 --> 01:23:17,649
I went into town.

781
01:23:17,722 --> 01:23:21,954
And got caught?
And went and got caught?

782
01:23:22,027 --> 01:23:23,517
Why?

783
01:23:23,595 --> 01:23:25,927
Because you said we couldn't.

784
01:23:25,997 --> 01:23:29,125
You told them where we were,
didn't you?

785
01:23:29,202 --> 01:23:30,965
You told them!

786
01:23:32,106 --> 01:23:34,040
My father turned me in.

787
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:38,578
Oh, God, they did things
you can't imagine.

788
01:23:45,355 --> 01:23:46,982
You son of a bitch!

789
01:23:48,993 --> 01:23:50,927
You want blindfolds?

790
01:23:50,995 --> 01:23:54,761
- This violates the Geneva Convention.
- I never heard of it!

791
01:23:54,833 --> 01:23:57,495
Dog face!
I show you how Soviet dies!

792
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:59,629
I've seen it before, pal.

793
01:23:59,706 --> 01:24:01,537
This isn't happening!

794
01:24:01,609 --> 01:24:02,974
Jed, let him go!

795
01:24:03,043 --> 01:24:05,102
- Shut up, Danny!
- He was one of us!

796
01:24:05,179 --> 01:24:06,544
Shut up!

797
01:24:06,615 --> 01:24:08,515
He told them where we were!

798
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:12,688
He did.
Now get your rifles.

799
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:18,356
- What did you say?
- I said no! We're not doing it!

800
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:22,627
Boy, say at me you are friend,
so I will not die alone.

801
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,793
What's the difference, Jed?

802
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:27,168
- I'll do it.
- Shut up, Robert!

803
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,868
Tell me what's the difference
between us and them!

804
01:24:35,783 --> 01:24:38,479
Because we live here.

805
01:24:44,027 --> 01:24:46,018
Don't shoot me.
Don't shoot.

806
01:24:46,096 --> 01:24:48,860
Don't shoot, Jed.
Don't shoot, Jed.

807
01:28:21,027 --> 01:28:23,962
How many of those you got left?

808
01:28:24,031 --> 01:28:25,123
Four.

809
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:30,135
Ready...

810
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:35,975
No, wait. Stop.

811
01:28:45,591 --> 01:28:48,219
What do you say?
You hungry?

812
01:29:02,478 --> 01:29:03,911
Go, Toni.

813
01:30:20,374 --> 01:30:22,808
Let's get it fast
and get back to the rock.

814
01:30:24,178 --> 01:30:25,668
Come on.

815
01:30:50,543 --> 01:30:52,477
It's been so long.

816
01:31:21,449 --> 01:31:23,110
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

817
01:31:43,343 --> 01:31:44,776
Oh, my God!

818
01:31:46,479 --> 01:31:48,071
Holy shit!

819
01:31:51,485 --> 01:31:52,918
Stay down!

820
01:31:59,995 --> 01:32:02,862
Get on your horses!
Let's get out of here!

821
01:32:07,972 --> 01:32:10,907
Erica, come on! Get on!

822
01:32:13,145 --> 01:32:15,579
Let's go! Let's go!

823
01:32:50,024 --> 01:32:52,356
Go on! Go on!

824
01:34:44,531 --> 01:34:46,158
Wolverines!

825
01:35:41,334 --> 01:35:43,029
I'm killed, Jed.

826
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:51,401
Don't let them get me,
because they'll make me talk.

827
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:03,925
Where's a gun?

828
01:36:06,565 --> 01:36:08,430
I want you to do it.

829
01:36:26,489 --> 01:36:27,922
I can't.

830
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:31,890
I can't, Toni.
I can't.

831
01:36:31,963 --> 01:36:33,555
It's okay.

832
01:36:38,871 --> 01:36:40,361
Give me a grenade.

833
01:36:43,978 --> 01:36:46,446
I don't wanna be too cold.

834
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,093
Pull the pin for me.

835
01:37:08,575 --> 01:37:10,167
Go.

836
01:37:10,244 --> 01:37:13,771
I'm just gonna stay here...

837
01:37:13,848 --> 01:37:16,442
and listen to the wind awhile, okay?

838
01:37:20,189 --> 01:37:21,622
Now go.

839
01:38:43,692 --> 01:38:45,626
Comrade Colonel.

840
01:38:49,398 --> 01:38:53,494
I would estimate
the enemy body count at 12.

841
01:38:55,106 --> 01:38:56,539
Twelve.

842
01:38:57,475 --> 01:38:59,602
wouldn't you agree?

843
01:39:00,813 --> 01:39:02,246
Twelve?

844
01:39:03,516 --> 01:39:05,006
Twelve?

845
01:39:08,823 --> 01:39:11,815
I saw only one.

846
01:39:14,897 --> 01:39:17,365
But they carry off their dead.

847
01:39:17,433 --> 01:39:19,765
Of course. Why not?

848
01:39:23,607 --> 01:39:25,575
What do you think?

849
01:40:08,395 --> 01:40:10,659
All right, now listen to me.

850
01:40:10,732 --> 01:40:13,701
You two are gonna wait up here
until the troops pull back into town.

851
01:40:13,769 --> 01:40:17,466
You'll know when that happens.
When they do, head out for the plains.

852
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:18,802
What about you?

853
01:40:18,875 --> 01:40:21,241
I gotta stick around...

854
01:40:21,311 --> 01:40:23,575
and stir things up a little
bit so you can make it out.

855
01:40:23,648 --> 01:40:25,240
We're going with you, Mattie.

856
01:40:25,316 --> 01:40:27,250
Will you listen to me?

857
01:40:28,554 --> 01:40:30,488
We're all that's left.

858
01:40:30,556 --> 01:40:33,525
Somebody's gotta live.
Somebody's gotta make it.

859
01:40:39,568 --> 01:40:41,502
Me and Jed, we're all used up.

860
01:40:53,885 --> 01:40:55,819
I'm never gonna forget...

861
01:40:56,856 --> 01:40:59,051
as long as I live.

862
01:41:05,032 --> 01:41:06,465
Don't.

863
01:41:13,976 --> 01:41:15,910
You're never gonna know who won.

864
01:41:18,381 --> 01:41:20,110
Who will?

865
01:41:22,486 --> 01:41:26,650
We could make it, Jed.
We've done a lot tougher than this.

866
01:41:26,725 --> 01:41:30,786
We could cause a diversion,
get out, head back to the mountains.

867
01:41:34,902 --> 01:41:36,335
I love you, Mattie.

868
01:41:39,074 --> 01:41:40,769
I know.

869
01:41:40,843 --> 01:41:43,107
I love you too, Jed.

870
01:42:05,739 --> 01:42:07,673
It's hard being brothers,
isn't it?

871
01:42:24,597 --> 01:42:25,689
Let's go.

872
01:42:31,771 --> 01:42:35,400
I can't remember
what it was to be warm.

873
01:42:37,246 --> 01:42:42,445
It seems a thousand years
since I was a small boy in the sun.

874
01:42:44,154 --> 01:42:47,681
How did I come to this high,
desolate place...

875
01:42:48,792 --> 01:42:51,192
where there is
nothing but loneliness?

876
01:42:54,199 --> 01:42:55,860
So much is lost.

877
01:42:57,503 --> 01:43:01,667
I want to look into
your eyes and forget.

878
01:43:03,711 --> 01:43:06,976
It all seems so far away...

879
01:43:07,048 --> 01:43:11,712
a warm house
where my shadow never falls...

880
01:43:13,056 --> 01:43:17,356
your long, black hair in my hands.

881
01:43:20,031 --> 01:43:22,932
There is no more revolution...

882
01:43:23,001 --> 01:43:25,561
only you to come back to.

883
01:43:26,839 --> 01:43:29,103
I will post my resignation.

884
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:50,535
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

885
01:45:29,757 --> 01:45:32,123
They're attacking the station.

886
01:45:34,863 --> 01:45:37,127
Everybody to the station.

887
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:06,494
Hurry! Hurry!

888
01:47:11,448 --> 01:47:12,380
You lose.

889
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,591
Go with god.

890
01:48:19,499 --> 01:48:21,467
You can rest now.

891
01:48:25,172 --> 01:48:27,106
Just hang on, Mattie.

892
01:48:31,747 --> 01:48:35,148
Oh, Mattie.
It's okay, Mattie. It's okay.

893
01:48:35,218 --> 01:48:39,314
Just hang on, Mattie.
Daddy'll be here soon, Mattie.

894
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:41,324
Hang on, Mattie.

895
01:48:43,929 --> 01:48:46,921
Come on, Mattie.
Daddy'll be here soon.

896
01:48:57,613 --> 01:48:59,547
Come on, Mattie.

897
01:49:07,024 --> 01:49:11,427
I'll hold you as long as I can, Mattie.
I'll hold you as long as I can.

898
01:49:11,496 --> 01:49:13,293
You can lean on me.

899
01:49:17,203 --> 01:49:19,137
I'm so tired.

900
01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:24,541
I'm so tired.

901
01:50:05,228 --> 01:50:06,661
We're free now.

902
01:50:08,166 --> 01:50:09,599
Free.

903
01:50:23,719 --> 01:50:26,017
I never saw the brothers again.

904
01:50:26,088 --> 01:50:30,354
In time, this war,
like every other war, ended.

905
01:50:30,426 --> 01:50:32,121
But I never forgot.

906
01:50:32,195 --> 01:50:36,222
And I come to this place often,
when no one else does.

907
01:50:38,303 --> 01:50:41,033
"In the early days of World War III...

908
01:50:41,107 --> 01:50:44,304
guerrillas, mostly children...

909
01:50:44,376 --> 01:50:47,675
placed the names of their lost
upon this rock.

910
01:50:47,748 --> 01:50:51,844
They fought here alone
and gave up their lives...

911
01:50:51,919 --> 01:50:55,548
so that this nation
shall not perish from the earth."
