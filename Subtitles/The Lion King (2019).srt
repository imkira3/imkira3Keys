Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

Life's not fair...

30
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:06,785
is it, my little friend?

31
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:09,721
While some are
born to feast...

32
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:13,458
others spend their lives
in the dark,

33
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,427
begging for scraps.

34
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,497
The way I see it...

35
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:23,602
you and I
are exactly the same.

36
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:28,506
We both want to
find a way out.

37
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,242
The king approaches!

38
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:31,710
This is not a drill.

39
00:06:31,743 --> 00:06:33,545
His Majesty has requested
an audience.

40
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:37,249
Upon his entrance,
you will rise and genuflect.

41
00:06:37,282 --> 00:06:38,850
Zazu...

42
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:42,153
you've made me lose my lunch.

43
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:44,189
You will answer
to Mufasa

44
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:45,557
for missing the ceremony
this morning.

45
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,026
I answer to no one.

46
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:52,197
Scar? Scar. Scar.

47
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,366
No, no.
Don't look at me like that.

48
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:56,801
Are you hungry, Zazu?

49
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:58,703
Perhaps we could have
a bite together!

50
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:02,140
You can't eat me!

51
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:05,476
It is forbidden to eat a
member of the king's court!

52
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,179
Ow! No, please! Stop it!

53
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:10,115
Scar!

54
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,452
Well, look who's come down
to mingle with the commoners.

55
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:20,691
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

56
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:23,929
Was that today?

57
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:28,967
Must've slipped
my mind.

58
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,669
Of course
I meant no disrespect

59
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:36,041
towards His Majesty
or Sarabi.

60
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:42,646
As you know, I have tremendous
respect for the queen.

61
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:44,648
As the king's brother,

62
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:46,550
you should've been
first in line.

63
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,452
I was first in line.

64
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:51,055
Or don't you remember?

65
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:55,159
That is, until the precious
prince arrived.

66
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:58,296
Don't turn your back
on me, Scar.

67
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,563
Oh, no, Mufasa,

68
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:02,132
perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

69
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:05,769
Is that a challenge?

70
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:10,240
I wouldn't dream
of challenging you again.

71
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:12,343
A wise decision.

72
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:14,678
You are no match
for His Royalness.

73
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:18,082
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

74
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,718
But when it comes
to brute strength,

75
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,387
I'm afraid
my big brother...

76
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,989
will always rule.

77
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:27,358
Not always, Scar.

78
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,694
One day, it'll be
my son who rules.

79
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,030
Simba will be your king.

80
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:36,200
Then long live the king.

81
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,637
- What am I gonna do with him?
- Oh, come on.

82
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:42,840
We both know
he should've been

83
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:45,476
expelled from the
Pride Lands long ago.

84
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,344
He's my brother, Zazu.

85
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:48,544
This is his home.

86
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:52,383
As long as I am king,
that will never change.

87
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,051
Well, there's one
in every family, sire.

88
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:56,586
I had a cousin who thought
he was a woodpecker.

89
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,522
He slammed his head
into trees,

90
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:00,723
and our beaks
aren't built for it.

91
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:03,726
He was concussed regularly.
Oh, you've gone.

92
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,996
Uh, sire, coming back!

93
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,367
Simba.

94
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:04,213
Dad, you awake?

95
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:08,384
Dad, wake up!

96
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,685
Dad!

97
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:13,589
Dad, Dad, Dad!

98
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:16,492
Your son's awake.

99
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:17,593
Before sunrise,

100
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,161
he's your son.

101
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:20,762
Come on, Dad, let's go.

102
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:22,498
You said I could
patrol with you today.

103
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:23,765
And today has started.

104
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:26,536
You promised!
You up?

105
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:37,446
Let's do this!

106
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,415
Let's do this.

107
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:41,750
So, what's first?

108
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:44,853
Give orders for the hunt?
Chase away evil intruders?

109
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:49,457
Dad! You're going
the wrong way!

110
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:00,902
Dad?

111
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:03,405
I'm not supposed
to go up here.

112
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:05,240
Look, Simba.

113
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:10,445
Everything the light touches
is our kingdom.

114
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:13,114
You rule
all of that?

115
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:14,616
Yes.

116
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,052
But a king's time
as ruler...

117
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:20,322
rises and falls
like the sun.

118
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:21,923
One day, Simba...

119
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:25,060
the sun will set
on my time here...

120
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:27,963
and will rise with you
as the new king.

121
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:33,268
All of this
will belong to me?

122
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:35,170
It belongs to no one,

123
00:12:35,203 --> 00:12:37,706
but will be yours
to protect.

124
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:40,075
A great responsibility.

125
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:42,210
Everything
the light touches?

126
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:46,281
Those trees?
And the watering hole?

127
00:12:46,314 --> 00:12:47,982
And that mountain?

128
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:50,552
And beyond
those shadows?

129
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:52,487
You must not go there, Simba.

130
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,189
But I thought a king could do
whatever he wants.

131
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:57,124
Take any territory.

132
00:12:57,157 --> 00:13:00,629
While others search
for what they can take...

133
00:13:00,662 --> 00:13:03,531
a true king searches
for what he can give.

134
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:12,440
Everything you see
exists together

135
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:14,375
in a delicate balance.

136
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:18,846
As king, you need to
understand that balance...

137
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,081
and respect
all the creatures...

138
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:24,051
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

139
00:13:25,185 --> 00:13:28,255
But, Dad,
don't we eat the antelope?

140
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:32,059
Yes, Simba.
But let me explain.

141
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:36,563
When we die, our bodies
become the grass...

142
00:13:36,597 --> 00:13:39,433
and the antelope
eat the grass...

143
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:44,672
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

144
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:46,874
- Sire!
- Morning, Zazu.

145
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:48,609
Do you have
the morning report?

146
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:50,110
Yes, sire.

147
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:52,513
Ten flamingos
are taking a stand.

148
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:53,981
Two giraffe
were caught necking.

149
00:13:54,014 --> 00:13:55,149
The buzz
from the bees...

150
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:56,450
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

151
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:57,418
Ready for some fun?

152
00:13:57,451 --> 00:13:59,219
The birds are tweeting
at 4:00 in the morning.

153
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:01,021
I'm like,
"Birds, we get it."

154
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:02,723
Stay low to the ground.

155
00:14:02,756 --> 00:14:03,823
I got this.

156
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:07,261
Check the wind,
the shadows...

157
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:09,829
and wait for
the perfect moment to pounce.

158
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:10,963
The cheetahs stole
the baboons' dinner,

159
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:12,132
and now the baboons
are going ape.

160
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,535
Of course, as I say,
cheetahs never prosper.

161
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:15,636
That's what I say.

162
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:16,770
Do you get...
I'll say it again.

163
00:14:16,804 --> 00:14:18,472
Cheetahs never...

164
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:24,010
Come on! It's the news!

165
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,716
That's very good!

166
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:31,884
Sire!

167
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:34,588
Sire! Hyenas
in the Pride Lands.

168
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:35,756
They're on the hunt!

169
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:37,156
Where's Sarabi?

170
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,726
She's leading the charge.

171
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,126
Zazu, take Simba home.

172
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,195
Dad, let me come! I can help.

173
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:45,632
No, son. You stay
with the other cubs.

174
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,234
I am not a cub.

175
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:52,338
Come on.

176
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:53,940
Let's go home.

177
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:06,886
Here we are.

178
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:10,890
Now you go along and
play with the other cubs.

179
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:16,462
Great.

180
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,345
If you wish
to kill something...

181
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:08,815
you might want
to stay downwind.

182
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:10,616
I know how to hunt,
Uncle Scar.

183
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,019
Well, let's hope we're never
attacked by a beetle.

184
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:17,956
Go back to your den, Simba.
I don't babysit.

185
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:20,992
Babysit? I'm gonna be the king
of Pride Rock.

186
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:25,063
My dad showed me
the whole kingdom.

187
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:27,433
Said I'm going to
rule it all.

188
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:29,034
Is that so?

189
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:30,202
Think about it.

190
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:33,506
When I'm king,
I'll have to give you orders.

191
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:35,441
Tell you what to do.

192
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:37,342
How weird is that?

193
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:40,513
You've no idea.

194
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,651
So, your dad showed you
the whole kingdom?

195
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:49,187
Did he show you the shadows
beyond the northern borders?

196
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:53,592
No. He said I can't
go there. Ever.

197
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:57,596
And he's
absolutely right.

198
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:02,702
An elephant graveyard is no
place for a young prince.

199
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:07,005
An elephant graveyard?
Whoa.

200
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:09,574
Oh, dear.
I've said too much.

201
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,811
Though I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later...

202
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:14,746
you being king and all.

203
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,147
You've been there?

204
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:19,751
We've all been there.
And it's no place for a cub.

205
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:22,153
All those
rotting bones...

206
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:25,357
and burning pools
of oozing mud.

207
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,826
Rotting bones?
Oozing mud?

208
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:31,196
Promise me
you'll stay away, Simba.

209
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:33,098
Now, you run along.

210
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:38,503
And remember...

211
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:42,807
it's our
little secret...

212
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:46,211
Your Majesty.

213
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:55,787
Nala! Come on.
We have to go.

214
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,689
- Where?
- Watering hole.

215
00:17:57,722 --> 00:17:59,824
Simba, she's having
her bath.

216
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:01,826
And it's time
for yours.

217
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,193
But, Mom...

218
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:05,095
I can do it myself.

219
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:06,431
Hold still.

220
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:08,299
You're messing up
my mane!

221
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:10,535
Come on.
Behind the ears.

222
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:12,369
Come on, Mom!

223
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:17,776
See? All clean. Can we go?

224
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:19,410
There's no hyenas.

225
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:22,246
You just chased them all off.

226
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:25,482
Just to the watering hole
and no further.

227
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,753
And stay downwind.

228
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:30,789
And one more
little thing.

229
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:32,757
Zazu will be going
with you.

230
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:33,858
Zazu?

231
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:34,926
Zazu goes...

232
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,628
or you don't.

233
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:43,935
Come along. Keep up.
Let's move in a unit.

234
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:45,469
Okay, buddy system.

235
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:47,538
So, where are we
really going?

236
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:48,672
How did you know?

237
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:49,808
You hate the water.

238
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:52,010
I heard about
this place, Nala.

239
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:53,777
The most incredible,
amazing...

240
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:55,679
Just tell me where.

241
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:58,749
An elephant graveyard.

242
00:18:58,782 --> 00:19:00,885
Whoa. How far is it?

243
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:02,686
Not far.
Just to the shadows.

244
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,923
But don't worry,
everyone's been there.

245
00:19:04,956 --> 00:19:06,256
We've never been
that far before.

246
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,558
What if we get lost?

247
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:08,826
Relax, Nala.

248
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:12,063
I patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad.

249
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:13,764
There's nothing
to worry about.

250
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:16,533
Well, there is
one thing.

251
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:19,303
We have an imminent threat.
Something is approaching.

252
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:21,472
Oh, wait, scratch that.
That's my own shadow.

253
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:23,607
How we getting rid
of the dodo?

254
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:25,242
Trust me, I got this.

255
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:26,744
Follow me to freedom.

256
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:30,080
Oh, how lovely it is...

257
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:33,584
to see the future king
with his future queen.

258
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:35,319
I could just molt.

259
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:37,153
What do you mean,
"future queen"?

260
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:40,156
Well, one day the two of
you will be betrothed.

261
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:43,226
Intended. Affianced.

262
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:45,496
Simba, you speak bird?

263
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:46,497
Married!

264
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,165
Come on. One day
you will be married.

265
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,169
To each other.

266
00:19:53,202 --> 00:19:54,605
- Ugh!
- Ew!

267
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:56,473
Mmm-mmm. That's not
gonna happen, Zazu.

268
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:57,340
Never ever.

269
00:19:57,373 --> 00:19:58,642
Nala and I are friends.

270
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:01,078
And besides,
she's afraid of rhinos!

271
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:02,178
And he's never eaten
an impala.

272
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:03,279
I've tried it once.

273
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:04,948
We are never
getting married, Zazu.

274
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:07,017
A monarch
who ignores tradition?

275
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:08,552
With an attitude
like that,

276
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:10,921
I'm afraid you'll be
a pretty pathetic king.

277
00:20:10,954 --> 00:20:13,691
Well, I'm not letting
anyone tell me where to go,

278
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:14,825
what to do...

279
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:16,126
and even who to marry.

280
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,128
There will never be
a king like me.

281
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:21,597
Simba, you can't escape
your destiny.

282
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,433

This is not good!

346

Simba, we really lost him.

347
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:28,149
I know
what you're thinking.

348
00:23:28,183 --> 00:23:29,516
"The future king
is a genius."

00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:30,886
You can't be serious.

350
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:33,454
You would've never gotten
away without your queen.

351
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:35,056
Aren't you
forgetting something?

352
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,691
There is no queen.

353
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:38,026
You could
say that again.

354
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:39,460
I'd rather marry
an aardvark.

355
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:41,162
Good luck finding one
that will say yes.

356
00:23:41,196 --> 00:23:43,131
Good luck getting out of here
without a bruising.

357
00:23:43,164 --> 00:23:45,033
Give it your best shot.

358
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:49,536
Pinned ya!

359
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,472
You owe me an apology.

360
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:53,074
Never!

361
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,085
Pinned ya. Again.

362
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,387
Nala, stop!

363
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:06,487
What is that?

364
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,256
You're not gonna
trick me, Simba.

365
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,658
I know that
there's nothing...

366
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:15,829
This must be it.

367
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,199
Come on!

368
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:41,021
Simba, we're way
beyond the Pride Lands.

369
00:24:41,055 --> 00:24:43,624
We found it, Nala.
You know what this means?

370
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:45,059
It means
we can go home.

371
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:48,629
It means they won't
treat us like cubs anymore.

372
00:25:37,543 --> 00:25:40,080
Simba, get down!
It could be dangerous.

373
00:25:40,114 --> 00:25:41,415
Danger?

374
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:44,884
I laugh in the face
of danger.

375
00:25:47,988 --> 00:25:48,888
Cool!

376
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:51,691
You hear that, Nala?

377
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,693
Simba, come on!

378
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:55,528
You've proved
how brave you are.

379
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:56,696
Now the sun is going down,

380
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:58,931
I'm not just
gonna sit here and...

381
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:23,589
Well, look at this.

382
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:27,260
We weren't
expecting guests today.

383
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:29,762
Would you two cubs...

384
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:31,764
like to stay for dinner?

385
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,800
Yeah, stay for dinner.

386
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:36,369
'Cause you look
like a midnight snack!

387
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:38,137
Can you just give me
a little bit of space?

388
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:39,038
I'm helping.

389
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:41,007
We have talked
about this before.

390
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,041
I come in alone.

391
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:44,577
I'm the lead distraction
so everyone can circle.

392
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,879
Okay, okay. Sorry.

393
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:48,714
Don't be sorry.
Just do it.

394
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:49,982
Now,
this is a meal

395
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:52,118
I've waited
my whole life for.

396
00:26:56,923 --> 00:27:01,861
What an unexpected treat,
to eat the son of a king.

397
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:04,629
Wait a second, the king?
As in you-know-who?

398
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:06,232
Who rules
you-know-where?

399
00:27:06,265 --> 00:27:09,368
Mufasa does not rule me!

400
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:11,804
You can't do anything
to me!

401
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,906
'Cause I'm
the future king!

402
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:18,511
He's telling me
what to do.

403
00:27:18,544 --> 00:27:21,180
His father's strength
flickering inside.

404
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:23,983
I wonder...

405
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:26,252
how all that bravery
will taste.

406
00:27:27,153 --> 00:27:29,422
Let them go, Shenzi!

407
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:31,923
They made a mistake,
a horrible mistake!

408
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:35,994
But if you do this, you will
start a war with Mufasa!

409
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:37,796
Hyenas and lions
have been at war

410
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:39,731
since the beginning of time.

411
00:27:39,764 --> 00:27:43,202
But Mufasa's bloodline
will end here!

412
00:27:43,236 --> 00:27:44,604
Run!

413
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:52,777
Don't let them get away!

414
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,091
Come on!

415
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:28,480
Did you hear that?

416
00:28:28,513 --> 00:28:30,215
The future king!

417
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:31,617
Oh, don't hurt me!

418
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:33,985
Do it again!

419
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:11,289
If you ever come
near my son again...

420
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:14,326
No, Mufasa. Never.

421
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:16,428
Never again.

422
00:29:16,461 --> 00:29:19,064
You've been warned, Shenzi.

423
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:30,741
I thought
you were very brave.

424
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,278
Zazu?

425
00:30:09,113 --> 00:30:11,415
Take Nala back
to Pride Rock.

426
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:14,518
Yes, sire.

427
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:16,655
Don't be too hard
on him, sire.

428
00:30:16,688 --> 00:30:20,024
I remember a cub,
a certain headstrong cub...

429
00:30:20,057 --> 00:30:22,092
who was always getting
into scrapes.

430
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:24,828
And he achieved
some prominence,

431
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:26,530
did he not, sire?

432
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:29,166
I have to teach my son
a lesson.

433
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:36,573
Nala, come along.

434
00:30:42,746 --> 00:30:44,814
Simba?

435
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:06,537
You deliberately
disobeyed me.

436
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,771
I know.

437
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:09,707
You could
have been killed.

438
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,644
And what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

439
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:16,879
Do you understand
what's at stake?

440
00:31:16,913 --> 00:31:20,784
You jeopardized
the future of our pride.

441
00:31:20,818 --> 00:31:23,986
I just wanted to show you
I could do it.

442
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,089
That I could be brave
like you.

443
00:31:26,122 --> 00:31:28,492
I'm only brave
when I have to be,

444
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:30,561
when there's
no other choice.

445
00:31:30,594 --> 00:31:33,096
But you're not scared
of anything.

446
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:35,198
I was today.

447
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:36,065
You were?

448
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:40,370
Yes. I thought
I might lose you.

449
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:45,208
I guess even kings
get scared, huh?

450
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:48,812
More than you could
ever know.

451
00:31:48,846 --> 00:31:50,814
- But guess what?
- What?

452
00:31:50,848 --> 00:31:54,484
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

453
00:31:54,517 --> 00:31:57,721
That's 'cause nobody messes
with your dad.

454
00:31:57,755 --> 00:31:59,088
Come here.

455
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:12,935
- Dad?
- Uh-huh?

456
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:14,670
We're pals, right?

457
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:16,072
Right.

458
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:18,374
And we'll always
be together...

459
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:20,943
right?

460
00:32:20,977 --> 00:32:25,815
Simba, let me tell you
something my father told me.

461
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:27,884
Look at the stars.

462
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:30,353
The great kings
of the past...

463
00:32:30,386 --> 00:32:33,689
look down on us
from those stars.

464
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:36,025
- Really?
- Yes.

465
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:38,428
So whenever
you feel alone...

466
00:32:38,461 --> 00:32:41,397
just remember
that those kings...

467
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:44,434
will always be up there
to guide you.

468
00:32:45,033 --> 00:32:47,537
And so will I.

469
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,639
But I can't see them, Dad.

470
00:32:49,672 --> 00:32:51,808
Keep looking, son.

471
00:32:51,841 --> 00:32:53,609
Keep looking.

472
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:30,813
Mufasa is strong.

473
00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:32,882
Like, way stronger than us.

474
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:34,449
- Please give me some space.
- What?

475
00:33:34,483 --> 00:33:36,351
You could lay anywhere
in this cave.

476
00:33:36,384 --> 00:33:38,788
- Where do you want me to...
- I need some personal space.

477
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:40,622
- Okay?
- Okay.

478
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,459
Not to take anything away
from you. You were great.

479
00:33:44,493 --> 00:33:45,928
But he is...

480
00:33:45,962 --> 00:33:47,529
See, now I know you're
doing this on purpose.

481
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:50,165
Very brave, too.
Tough, good energy.

482
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:51,466
Now you're just
being spiteful.

483
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,534
Good posture.

484
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:53,635
Next time I see Mufasa...

485
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:56,438
I'm gonna teach him a lesson
he will never forget.

486
00:33:56,471 --> 00:33:58,875
Well, you're in luck!
He's right behind ya.

487
00:33:58,908 --> 00:34:00,475
Mufasa?

488
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:16,424
That's not the king.

489
00:34:18,193 --> 00:34:21,563
You fools have stripped your
land of every living thing.

490
00:34:21,596 --> 00:34:24,900
And yet I send
two little cubs your way...

491
00:34:24,933 --> 00:34:26,568
and they come back alive.

492
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:29,471
I guess we'll have to
eat you instead.

493
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:32,139
Why eat one meal...

494
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:35,944
when you can be feasting
the rest of your lives?

495
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:39,014
What could you possibly
offer us?

496
00:34:39,046 --> 00:34:41,850
A place where you can
fill your bellies.

497
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:43,785
Where everything
the light touches

498
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:45,987
is yours for the kill.

499
00:34:46,021 --> 00:34:48,188
The Pride Lands
are not yours to give.

500
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:50,725
The king controls
those hunting grounds.

501
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:03,605
That's why
we're going to kill him.

502
00:35:06,675 --> 00:35:09,611
Mufasa has always shown
too much restraint...

503
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:11,746
when it comes to hunting.

504
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:14,415
When I am king...

505
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:17,351
the mighty will be free to
take whatever they want.

506
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:21,121
Because a hyena's belly
is never full.

507
00:35:21,155 --> 00:35:23,657
Mufasa's far too powerful
to challenge.

My dad was
pretty upset with me.

535
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:22,275
That's why
we're here, Simba.

536
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:25,311
I think I know a way for
you to make it up to him.

537
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:28,748
A gift that will make him
forget it ever happened.

538
00:37:28,781 --> 00:37:31,985
But he's the king.
What could I give him?

539
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,753
Your roar.

540
00:37:33,786 --> 00:37:34,887
My roar?

541
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:36,422
Yes!

542
00:37:37,191 --> 00:37:38,958
Did you hear that?

543
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:43,996
This gorge is where all lions
come to find their roar.

544
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,231
All lions?

545
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,167
Even my dad?

546
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:50,236
Even Mufasa came here
when he was your age.

547
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,704
Refused to leave...

548
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:55,842
until his roar could
be heard above the rim.

549
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,111
All the way up there?

550
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,146
That's when you know
you've found it.

551
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:02,081
With a little practice...

552
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:04,984
you'll never be called
a cub again.

553
00:38:05,752 --> 00:38:07,285
Watch this.

554
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:11,657
You'll get it, Simba.

555
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:13,926
Just takes time.

556
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,695
I'll check on you later.

557
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:19,232
Dad will be so proud,
won't he?

558
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:21,968
It's a gift
he'll never forget.

559
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,007
Mufasa! Quick!

560
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,909
Stampede in the gorge!

561
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,177
Simba's down there!

562
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,612
Simba?

563
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,747
I'll find him.

564
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,175
Zazu!

565
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,777
Hold on!
Help is coming!

566
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,154
There he is!
On that tree!

567
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,060
I'm coming, Simba!
Hold on!

568
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:10,235
I'll help them, Zazu!
You get the pride!

569
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:11,635
Go!

570
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,495
Dad!

571
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,497
Simba!

572
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,866
Come to me, son.

573
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:44,601
Jump!

574
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,090
Dad!

575
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,779
Scar!

576
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,916
Help me.

577
00:43:14,657 --> 00:43:18,194
Long live the king!

578
00:43:24,867 --> 00:43:27,136
No!

579
00:43:45,855 --> 00:43:46,956
Dad?

580
00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:56,899
Dad?

581
00:44:23,024 --> 00:44:24,360
Dad?

582
00:44:28,464 --> 00:44:29,998
Dad?

583
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:43,778
Come on, wake up.

584
00:44:49,718 --> 00:44:54,256
Help! Somebody help!

585
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:27,556
Simba!

586
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:29,925
What have you done?

587
00:45:31,692 --> 00:45:33,628
It was a stampede.

588
00:45:33,662 --> 00:45:35,263
He tried to save me.

589
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:37,698
It was an accident.

590
00:45:37,731 --> 00:45:39,301
I didn't mean for it to...

591
00:45:39,334 --> 00:45:40,635
Of course you didn't.

592
00:45:40,669 --> 00:45:44,306
No one ever means
for these things to happen.

593
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:46,007
But the king is dead...

594
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:47,943
and if it weren't for you...

595
00:45:49,444 --> 00:45:51,745
he'd still be alive.

596
00:45:51,779 --> 00:45:54,683
Your father had
such hopes for you...

597
00:45:54,715 --> 00:45:57,952
gave you so many chances.

598
00:45:57,985 --> 00:46:00,622
And this is how you repay him.

599
00:46:00,655 --> 00:46:03,458
I didn't know.
I didn't know.

600
00:46:03,491 --> 00:46:05,493
Oh, what will
your mother think?

601
00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:08,929
A son who causes
his father's death.

602
00:46:08,963 --> 00:46:13,834
A boy who kills a king.

603
00:46:14,436 --> 00:46:16,837
What am I gonna do?

604
00:46:17,938 --> 00:46:19,507
Run.

605
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:22,711
Run away, Simba.

606
00:46:22,743 --> 00:46:26,314
Run away and never return!

607
00:46:38,225 --> 00:46:40,794
Kill him.

608
00:47:18,198 --> 00:47:21,402
Go down and make sure
he's dead.

609
00:47:29,243 --> 00:47:30,544
Seriously?

610
00:47:30,577 --> 00:47:32,379
Oh, I'm sorry.

611
00:47:34,814 --> 00:47:36,283
That's a good distance
right there.

612
00:47:36,317 --> 00:47:37,351
Okay.

613
00:47:39,286 --> 00:47:42,589
No little cub
could survive that fall.

614
00:47:42,623 --> 00:47:44,124
Listen,
we're gonna tell her...

615
00:47:44,158 --> 00:47:47,161
we went down there
and we ate him.

616
00:47:47,194 --> 00:47:49,363
Uh-huh. That's perfect,
'cause I am starving!

617
00:47:49,396 --> 00:47:51,130
We're not gonna
eat him.

618
00:47:51,165 --> 00:47:52,199
Simba is dead.

619
00:47:52,232 --> 00:47:54,967
That's all she ever
has to know.

620
00:47:56,704 --> 00:47:58,171
Works for me.

621
00:48:52,258 --> 00:48:57,497
Mufasa's death
is a terrible tragedy.

622
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:00,566
The greatest leader
the pride has ever known.

623
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,669
To lose a brother...

624
00:49:03,703 --> 00:49:09,142
such a deep,
personal loss.

625
00:49:09,175 --> 00:49:13,079
And little Simba,
who had barely begun to live.

626
00:49:13,112 --> 00:49:16,849
A cub whose blood
held our future.

627
00:49:16,883 --> 00:49:21,019
It's almost too much
to endure.

628
00:49:21,053 --> 00:49:24,457
I only wish I had gotten
to the gorge in time...

629
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,493
been there to save them.

630
00:49:28,694 --> 00:49:33,699
And so it is
with a heavy heart...

631
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:36,269
that I must
assume the throne.

632
00:49:36,302 --> 00:49:39,171
Mufasa and Simba
are gone...

633
00:49:39,204 --> 00:49:43,342
which means I am your king.

634
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:47,179
But I must admit...

635
00:49:47,212 --> 00:49:50,215
I cannot bear
this burden alone.

636
00:49:51,584 --> 00:49:53,853
And I will need
some help...

637
00:49:53,886 --> 00:49:55,922
to ensure

638
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:58,190
the safety of the pride.

639
00:50:05,565 --> 00:50:08,801
Nala, stay close.

640
00:50:08,835 --> 00:50:12,971
And so, from the ashes
of this tragedy...

641
00:50:13,004 --> 00:50:17,342
we shall welcome
the dawning of a new era.

642
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,177
A great...

643
00:50:19,879 --> 00:50:23,048
and glorious future!

644
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:35,494
Oh, dear.

645
00:52:20,731 --> 00:52:22,067
I missed 'em!

646
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:23,969
I'm gonna get one of
those vultures one day.

647
00:52:24,002 --> 00:52:25,135
I'm gonna get one!

648
00:52:25,169 --> 00:52:26,637
I don't know why it's
so important to you.

649
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:29,074
I just feel like it would
make me feel better.

650
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:31,275
Oh, no.
It's a little lion!

651
00:52:31,308 --> 00:52:33,310
- That is not a lion.
- Well then, go check it out.

652
00:52:33,344 --> 00:52:34,612
- What is it?
- That is not a lion,

653
00:52:34,645 --> 00:52:35,713
it's a furry bird!

654
00:52:35,746 --> 00:52:36,914
It looks
like a lion!

655
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:39,650
That's not a lion. Let me get
a closer look. Excuse me.

656
00:52:39,683 --> 00:52:42,686
All right, let me see
what we're dealing with here.

657
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,754
It's a lion!

658
00:52:43,787 --> 00:52:45,289
- Run for your life, Pumbaa!
- Wait! Hey, Timon.

659
00:52:45,322 --> 00:52:48,125
- Wait, Timon, wait!
- It's a little lion!

660
00:52:48,158 --> 00:52:49,426
It gets bigger.

661
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,428
Can we keep him?
Can we please keep him?

662
00:52:51,462 --> 00:52:53,464
Oh, oh, okay. I promise
I'll walk him every day!

663
00:52:53,497 --> 00:52:55,032
If he makes a little mess,
I'll clean it up.

664
00:52:55,065 --> 00:52:56,433
You'll be his little mess!

665
00:52:56,467 --> 00:52:58,402
He's gonna eat you and then
use my body as a toothpick!

666
00:52:58,435 --> 00:53:00,638
But one day,
when he's big and strong,

667
00:53:00,671 --> 00:53:01,972
he'll be
on our side!

668
00:53:02,006 --> 00:53:04,575
I've got it. What if
he's on our side?

669
00:53:04,608 --> 00:53:05,843
Hear me out!

670
00:53:05,876 --> 00:53:10,014
Having a ferocious lion around
might not be such a bad idea!

671
00:53:10,047 --> 00:53:11,415
Well then,
can we keep him?

672
00:53:11,448 --> 00:53:12,716
Yes, of course
we can keep him!

673
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,486
My God, who is the brains
of this operation?

674
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:17,655
♪ We're gonna
name him Fred! ♪

675
00:53:17,688 --> 00:53:19,490
Who are you?

676
00:53:20,356 --> 00:53:21,692
Uh, we're the guys
who saved your life.

677
00:53:21,725 --> 00:53:22,826
Yes.

678
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:25,062
Risked everything.
Fought off angry vultures!

679
00:53:25,095 --> 00:53:26,897
Hordes of them. Flocks.

680
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,297
I'm Pumbaa.

681
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:29,767
- This is Timon.
- Did I mention

682
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,167
that we saved your life?

683
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,369
It doesn't matter.

684
00:53:35,005 --> 00:53:37,240
Whoa. How bleak is that?

685
00:53:37,273 --> 00:53:38,676
It doesn't even matter?

686
00:53:38,709 --> 00:53:40,610
Like I don't have enough
that I'm dealing with, right?

687
00:53:40,644 --> 00:53:42,278
Now his problems
are my problems?

688
00:53:42,311 --> 00:53:44,580
But we can help him.
We're in a position to help him.

689
00:53:44,614 --> 00:53:48,986
So, how are you,
in as few words as possible?

690
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:51,055
I did something terrible.

691
00:53:51,088 --> 00:53:53,057
I don't wanna
talk about it.

692
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,625
Look, kid, we've all
made mistakes.

693
00:53:55,658 --> 00:53:58,528
Uh, there must be
something we can do, right?

694
00:53:58,561 --> 00:54:00,663
Not unless you can
change the past.

695
00:54:00,697 --> 00:54:02,198
Well, you know,
that's a lot to ask...

696
00:54:02,231 --> 00:54:03,299
That's pretty hard.
That's a biggie.

697
00:54:03,332 --> 00:54:04,434
...if I'm being honest.

698
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:06,136
I mean, change the past?
It already happened.

699
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,005
Yeah, so you can't
change that.

700
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:10,239
But you know
what you can change?

701
00:54:10,273 --> 00:54:12,408
The future.
That's our specialty.

702
00:54:12,442 --> 00:54:13,810
Kind of
our thing.

703
00:54:13,843 --> 00:54:16,479
How can you change something
that hasn't happened?

704
00:54:16,512 --> 00:54:18,648
Well, to change the future,

705
00:54:18,681 --> 00:54:20,516
you gotta put your past
behind you.

706
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:21,384
Way behind.

707
00:54:21,417 --> 00:54:23,686
Look, kid,
bad things happen

708
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,090
and you can't do anything
about it, right?

709
00:54:26,123 --> 00:54:27,256
Right.

710
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:29,992
Wrong! When the world
turns its back on you...

711
00:54:30,026 --> 00:54:32,295
you turn your back
on the world!

712
00:54:32,328 --> 00:54:34,263
And only embrace what's next!

713
00:54:34,297 --> 00:54:36,299
And turn the "what"
into "so what?"

714
00:54:36,332 --> 00:54:38,534
Well, that's not
what I was taught.

715
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:40,570
Well, then maybe
you need a new lesson.

716
00:54:40,603 --> 00:54:45,808
Repeat after me, kid.
Hakuna matata.

717
00:54:45,842 --> 00:54:47,877
- What?
- Hakuna matata.

718
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,312

719

a bigger reaction

720
00:54:50,446 --> 00:54:51,647
when we say it
the first...

721
00:54:51,681 --> 00:54:53,216
Okay, well anyway.
Hakuna matata.

722
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,650

clapping immediately.

Have you thought
about feeding that thing?

Yeah, I'm starved!
I could eat a whole zebra.

- No, listen, kid...

782
00:57:28,669 --> 00:57:30,838

you have to eat like us.

not eat us!

784

Ooh. Too chewy.

789
00:57:44,652 --> 00:57:46,221

I'm sorry, Nala.
I came as soon as I could.

The morning report, Zazu.

Your Majesty, the Pride Lands
are in imminent danger.

855
01:00:47,632 --> 01:00:50,702
The hyenas are chasing off
the last of the herds.

The bird's back!

Don't come here again,
unless you want to be eaten!

859
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:28,508
We have to do something,
Sarabi. We have to fight!

860
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:32,310
Nala. Scar is the king.

861
01:01:32,345 --> 01:01:33,945
But you are our queen!

862
01:01:33,979 --> 01:01:36,148
We should leave
before it's too late!

863
01:01:36,181 --> 01:01:40,586
We must all stay together
and protect the Pride Lands.

01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:44,356
This is our home.
We must never abandon it.

865
01:01:44,389 --> 01:01:46,492
This isn't the home
I remember.

866
01:01:46,526 --> 01:01:49,394
Our time will come, Nala.

867
01:01:49,427 --> 01:01:50,695
Be patient.

868
01:01:50,729 --> 01:01:52,264
Sarabi.

869
01:01:53,832 --> 01:01:55,867
The king wishes to see you.

870
01:01:56,535 --> 01:01:58,236
Don't go.

871
01:01:59,404 --> 01:02:01,940
I'm not afraid of him.

872
01:02:16,922 --> 01:02:19,457
Won't you join me, Sarabi?

873
01:02:19,491 --> 01:02:21,593
There's plenty
to go around.

874
01:02:21,626 --> 01:02:23,528
You're overhunting, Scar.

875
01:02:23,562 --> 01:02:25,796
I've simply perfected
the kill.

876
01:02:26,531 --> 01:02:28,233
With the help of my army.

877
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:30,768
You're killing everything.

878
01:02:30,801 --> 01:02:34,005
Don't you see? There is nobody
to challenge me.

879
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:36,740
We can finally take
whatever we want.

880
01:02:37,242 --> 01:02:38,677
We?

881
01:02:38,742 --> 01:02:42,514
Long ago
you chose Mufasa over me.

882
01:02:42,547 --> 01:02:44,915
But now there is a new king.

883
01:02:44,949 --> 01:02:47,552
So stop being so selfish.

884
01:02:47,586 --> 01:02:49,487
You are
the selfish one.

885
01:02:49,521 --> 01:02:51,590
The other lions
look to you.

886
01:02:51,623 --> 01:02:55,227
As long as you resist
they will reject me.

887
01:02:55,260 --> 01:03:00,465
Take your place by my side,
and we will feast together.

888
01:03:00,498 --> 01:03:03,468
I will never be your queen!

889
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:06,904
Then from now on...

890
01:03:06,937 --> 01:03:11,208
the lions will eat
after the hyenas.

891
01:03:11,242 --> 01:03:13,944
And they don't
leave much behind.

892
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:44,934
Just what do you think

893
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:47,036
you are doing,
young lady?

894
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:48,672
Go away, Zazu.

895
01:04:48,706 --> 01:04:50,574
I'm going to find help.

896
01:04:50,607 --> 01:04:52,509
I will very much
not go away.

897
01:04:52,543 --> 01:04:54,010
I am sworn to protect you

898
01:04:54,043 --> 01:04:56,012
and must order you
back to bed.

899
01:04:56,045 --> 01:04:58,981
I don't need
protecting anymore.

900
01:05:49,098 --> 01:05:52,001
Uh, Scar!
Uh, wonderful to see you.

901
01:05:52,034 --> 01:05:54,003
Uh,
sorry to drop in like this!

902
01:05:54,036 --> 01:05:55,671
Ah!

903
01:05:55,705 --> 01:05:58,374
Have I ever told you
about my brother

904
01:05:58,408 --> 01:06:01,544
who thought he was
a woodpecker?

905
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:16,091
Nala...

906
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:41,316
Oh, I'm gonna get ya!

907
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:43,351
I'm gonna get ya!
Oh, I got ya!

908
01:06:43,385 --> 01:06:44,887
Oh.

909
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:46,856
Simba! It's you!

910
01:06:46,889 --> 01:06:48,223
Did you see that?

911
01:06:48,256 --> 01:06:49,859
Man, that butterfly
was right there!

912
01:06:49,892 --> 01:06:51,226
I almost had him.

913
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:52,527
I thought it was a lion.

914
01:06:52,562 --> 01:06:54,564
You know,
the other kind of lion.

915
01:06:54,597 --> 01:06:55,964
You know, a real lion?

916
01:06:55,997 --> 01:06:57,499
I mean, not that
you're not a real lion.

917
01:06:57,532 --> 01:06:59,702
But you know,
the kind that eats...

918
01:06:59,735 --> 01:07:01,102
I'm gonna go.

919
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:03,638
Hey, where you going?

920
01:07:03,673 --> 01:07:06,107
You wanna get some grubs?

921
01:07:08,744 --> 01:07:10,512
What's up with that guy?

922
01:07:10,545 --> 01:07:11,546
Um, Simba...

923
01:07:12,113 --> 01:07:14,015
How can I say this?

924
01:07:14,049 --> 01:07:15,750
- He's prey.
- Yeah.

925
01:07:15,785 --> 01:07:20,155
And he is never gonna want to
frolic with a carnivore.

926
01:07:20,188 --> 01:07:22,457
No. You two will
never frolic.

927
01:07:22,491 --> 01:07:24,059
Why not?

928
01:07:24,092 --> 01:07:28,430
You see, in nature
there's a delicate balance.

929
01:07:28,463 --> 01:07:30,465
Oh, yeah. The circle of life.
I know that.

930
01:07:30,499 --> 01:07:32,234
- No.
- No, no, no.

931
01:07:32,267 --> 01:07:33,535
I don't know where you're
getting "circle" from.

932
01:07:33,568 --> 01:07:34,603
No, yeah.

933
01:07:34,636 --> 01:07:35,770
There's no
circle of life.

934
01:07:35,804 --> 01:07:37,138
- No, it's no circle.
- No, not at all.

935
01:07:37,172 --> 01:07:39,074
- In fact, it's the opposite.
- Yeah.

936
01:07:39,107 --> 01:07:40,342
- It's a line.
- Yeah.

937
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:43,044
It's a meaningless line
of indifference.

938
01:07:43,078 --> 01:07:45,514
And we're all just running
towards the end of the line.

939
01:07:45,547 --> 01:07:49,049
And then one day we'll reach
the end, and that'll be it.

940
01:07:49,083 --> 01:07:50,252
- That's it.
- Line over!

941
01:07:50,285 --> 01:07:52,187
- Nothing.
- Nada.

942
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,455
And you can really
just kinda...

943
01:07:53,488 --> 01:07:55,357
do your own thing
and fend for yourself...

944
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:57,325
'cause your line doesn't
affect anyone else's lines.

945
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,895
You're alive and then
you're not. Like this guy.

946
01:07:59,928 --> 01:08:01,161
Mmm.

947
01:08:01,195 --> 01:08:03,298
You sure it's not a circle?

948
01:08:03,331 --> 01:08:05,132
That we're all connected?

949
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:07,469
A circle would mean
we're all this.

950
01:08:07,502 --> 01:08:10,037
That would mean
what I do affects him...

951
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:11,506
affects that thing,
affects that thing.

952
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,240
Yeah. No.
That's not how it goes.

953
01:08:13,274 --> 01:08:14,976
Which would make
doing whatever we wanted

954
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:16,277
not that cool.

955
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:17,979
Let me simplify this
for you.

956
01:08:18,013 --> 01:08:19,681
- Life is meaningless.
- Yes.

957
01:08:19,714 --> 01:08:21,883
That's why you just gotta
look out for yourself.

958
01:08:21,917 --> 01:08:23,317
That's why you do you, Simba.

959
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:25,620
Yeah, Simba,
for the first time...

960
01:08:25,654 --> 01:08:28,188
we're entrusting you to
make a plan for us today.

961
01:08:28,222 --> 01:08:31,026
This is important.
Think about all you've been taught.

962
01:08:31,058 --> 01:08:33,227
What do you wanna do?

963
01:08:34,061 --> 01:08:37,097
Absolutely nothing.

964
01:08:38,332 --> 01:08:40,134
Whoo-hoo!
- Exactly! He gets it!

965
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:42,003
Jackpot!

966
01:08:42,037 --> 01:08:43,270
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

967
01:08:43,304 --> 01:08:45,807
- Crunchy!
- All right! Time to eat!

968
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:58,352
Oh.

969
01:08:58,385 --> 01:09:00,754
Hello!

970
01:09:00,788 --> 01:09:02,556
Nice one, Simba.

971
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:05,326
Oh, thanks.
Must've been the termites.

972
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,528
Or the crickets.

973
01:09:08,662 --> 01:09:11,599
And you wonder why I prefer
to sleep underground.

974
01:09:12,132 --> 01:09:14,069
Hey, Timon.

975
01:09:14,101 --> 01:09:15,336
Do you ever look up there

976
01:09:15,369 --> 01:09:17,738
and wonder what
those sparkly dots are?

977
01:09:17,771 --> 01:09:21,842
Oh, Pumbaa.
I don't wonder. I know.

978
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:24,111
Really?
What are they?

979
01:09:24,144 --> 01:09:25,679
They're fireflies.

980
01:09:25,713 --> 01:09:29,950
Fireflies that got stuck on that
big, bluish-black thing.

981
01:09:29,984 --> 01:09:31,118
Oh.

982
01:09:31,151 --> 01:09:32,453
I guess that makes sense.

983
01:09:32,486 --> 01:09:34,488
I always thought
they were balls of gas

984
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:36,690
burning
billions of miles away.

985
01:09:36,724 --> 01:09:39,493
Oh, Pumbaa, why is everything
always gas with you?

986
01:09:39,526 --> 01:09:41,160
I know.

987
01:09:41,194 --> 01:09:42,963
- What do you think, Simba?
- Yeah.

988
01:09:42,997 --> 01:09:45,366
Oh, I don't know.

989
01:09:46,232 --> 01:09:48,335
But somebody once told me...

990
01:09:48,369 --> 01:09:50,638
the great kings of the past
are up there...

991
01:09:50,671 --> 01:09:53,907
and they're all
watching over us.

992
01:09:58,244 --> 01:10:01,949
That's a good one!
That's insane!

993
01:10:01,982 --> 01:10:03,851
That's insane!

994
01:10:04,985 --> 01:10:07,087
Royal dead guys
watching over us!

995
01:10:07,121 --> 01:10:09,188
Well, I hope they don't
fall out of the sky!

996
01:10:09,222 --> 01:10:11,959
Hang on, Your Majesty!
Don't let go!

997
01:10:11,992 --> 01:10:13,560
Oh, that would be a mess.

998
01:10:13,594 --> 01:10:14,460
Oh, man!

999
01:10:14,494 --> 01:10:15,729
I mean, Simba,
think about it.

1000
01:10:15,763 --> 01:10:18,132
Why would a bunch of kings
be looking out for us?

1001
01:10:18,164 --> 01:10:19,232
We're outcasts.

1002
01:10:19,265 --> 01:10:20,333
Royal warthogs!

1003
01:10:20,366 --> 01:10:21,802
I can't! I can't!

1004
01:10:21,835 --> 01:10:23,103
I can't!
I actually can't.

1005
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:24,170
I can't.

1006
01:10:24,203 --> 01:10:26,874
No, you can.
I can't.

1007
01:10:28,174 --> 01:10:31,045
Yeah. Yeah.

1008
01:10:31,078 --> 01:10:33,179
Yeah.

1009
01:10:33,212 --> 01:10:34,748
That's stupid.

1010
01:10:34,782 --> 01:10:39,185
I'm gonna go get some grubs
or something.

1011
01:10:45,993 --> 01:10:47,293
What did you say
to him?

1012
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,728
I don't know.

1013
01:10:48,761 --> 01:10:49,997
As you were saying it,

1014
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:51,431
I thought,
"This won't end well."

1015
01:10:51,464 --> 01:10:52,765
You just
start laughing.

1016
01:10:52,799 --> 01:10:53,967
You laughed too.

1017
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:56,070
I did not.
I would never.

1018

♪ His carefree days
with us are history

1136
01:21:10,444 --> 01:21:17,451
♪ In short,
our pal is doomed ♪

1137
01:21:31,164 --> 01:21:33,767
I told you.
Isn't it great here?

1138
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:35,803
You know, maybe it could be
like this forever.

1139
01:21:35,835 --> 01:21:38,004
It's amazing.

1140
01:21:38,037 --> 01:21:41,307
But there's something
I don't understand.

1141
01:21:41,341 --> 01:21:43,843
If you've been alive
all this time...

1142
01:21:43,876 --> 01:21:45,912
why haven't you
come home?

1143
01:21:45,945 --> 01:21:48,114
We've really
needed you.

1144
01:21:48,147 --> 01:21:49,783
They're fine,
all right?

1145
01:21:49,817 --> 01:21:51,384
Nobody needs me.

1146
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:53,086
You're the king.

1147
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:55,955
Nala, Scar is the king.

1148
01:21:55,988 --> 01:21:58,991
Simba, he's decimated
the Pride Lands.

1149
01:21:59,025 --> 01:22:00,960
There's no food,
no water...

1150
01:22:00,993 --> 01:22:03,029
There's nothing I can do.

1151
01:22:03,062 --> 01:22:04,798
What about your mother?

1152
01:22:04,832 --> 01:22:06,899
This is
your responsibility.

1153
01:22:06,933 --> 01:22:08,534
You need to challenge Scar.

1154
01:22:08,568 --> 01:22:11,537
I can't go back. Ever.

1155
01:22:11,571 --> 01:22:12,840
Why?

1156
01:22:12,872 --> 01:22:14,775
Because of what happened
at the gorge?

1157
01:22:14,808 --> 01:22:16,008
Scar told us that...

1158
01:22:16,042 --> 01:22:17,510
You wouldn't understand!

1159
01:22:17,543 --> 01:22:18,978
None of it matters. Okay?

1160
01:22:19,011 --> 01:22:20,580
Hakuna matata.

1161
01:22:20,613 --> 01:22:21,714
What?

1162
01:22:21,748 --> 01:22:23,649
It's something
I learned out here, okay?

1163
01:22:23,683 --> 01:22:25,218
You see,
sometimes bad things happen,

1164
01:22:25,251 --> 01:22:27,253
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

1165
01:22:27,286 --> 01:22:28,821
So, why worry?

1166
01:22:28,855 --> 01:22:30,857
Why worry?

1167
01:22:30,889 --> 01:22:32,891
What happened to you?

1168
01:22:32,925 --> 01:22:35,294
You're not
the Simba I remember.

1169
01:22:35,328 --> 01:22:38,364
And I never will be.
Are you satisfied?

1170
01:22:38,398 --> 01:22:40,066
No, I'm disappointed.

1171
01:22:40,099 --> 01:22:42,502
You know, now you're starting
to sound like my father.

1172
01:22:42,535 --> 01:22:45,772
Good. I'm glad
one of us does.

1173
01:22:45,805 --> 01:22:48,241
You have no idea
what I've been through!

1174
01:22:48,274 --> 01:22:51,144
I came here
looking for help.

1175
01:22:52,779 --> 01:22:55,314
I guess I made a mistake.

1176
01:22:56,382 --> 01:22:58,150
Goodbye, Simba.

1177
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,234
"Disappointed"?

1178
01:23:16,803 --> 01:23:18,970
She wants me to go home?

1179
01:23:19,004 --> 01:23:21,006
I am home.

1180
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:23,108
"Best friend"?

1181
01:23:23,141 --> 01:23:25,578
I don't need best friends.
I don't need anybody.

1182
01:23:26,244 --> 01:23:27,547
Never did.

1183
01:23:54,473 --> 01:23:56,441
Go away.

1184
01:23:56,475 --> 01:23:59,211
Going away will not
answer the question.

1185
01:23:59,244 --> 01:24:02,247
What question?
Who are you?

1186
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,549
I know
exactly who I am.

1187
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:07,486
The question is,
who are you?

1188
01:24:07,519 --> 01:24:11,756
I'm nobody. So leave me alone.
All right?

1189
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:16,027
Everybody is somebody.
Even a nobody.

1190
01:24:16,061 --> 01:24:18,129
Yeah,
I think you're confused.

1191
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:20,999
I am confused?

1192
01:24:21,032 --> 01:24:23,768
You don't even know
who you are.

1193
01:24:23,802 --> 01:24:25,770
Oh. And I suppose
you do?

1194
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:30,141
I held the son of Mufasa.

1195
01:24:32,244 --> 01:24:33,712
You knew my father?

1196
01:24:33,745 --> 01:24:34,846
Correction.

1197
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,781
I know your father.

1198
01:24:36,815 --> 01:24:39,049
He died a long time ago.

1199
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:41,085
He's alive!

1200
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:43,288
And I can
take you to him.

1201
01:24:43,321 --> 01:24:45,089
Follow me.
I will show you!

1202
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:46,156
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

1203
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:47,459
If you can keep up!

1204
01:24:48,025 --> 01:24:49,594
Wait!

1205
01:24:59,036 --> 01:25:01,071
Follow me!

1206
01:25:07,244 --> 01:25:09,814
Quickly, quickly!
Come through!

1207
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:15,386
Hey! Slow down!

1208
01:25:17,856 --> 01:25:20,524
Hey,
you better hurry.

1209
01:25:20,558 --> 01:25:23,460
Hold on.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1210
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:44,748
Come.

1211
01:25:54,391 --> 01:25:57,461
Your father is waiting.

1212
01:26:09,573 --> 01:26:11,442
Do you see him?

1213
01:26:12,676 --> 01:26:14,812
I don't see anything.

1214
01:26:16,847 --> 01:26:18,315
Look closer.

1215
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:25,422
You see?

1216
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:29,258
He lives in you.

1217
01:26:31,795 --> 01:26:33,597
Simba.

1218
01:26:39,670 --> 01:26:41,170
Dad?

1219
01:26:41,772 --> 01:26:43,406
Simba.

1220
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:48,479
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

1221
01:26:49,947 --> 01:26:50,981
I can't.

1222
01:26:51,015 --> 01:26:54,084
You must remember
who you are.

1223
01:26:54,118 --> 01:26:56,720
The one true king.

1224
01:26:56,754 --> 01:26:57,821
I'm sorry.

1225
01:26:59,056 --> 01:27:01,424
I don't know
how to be like you.

1226
01:27:01,457 --> 01:27:05,796
As king, I was most proud
of one thing.

1227
01:27:05,829 --> 01:27:08,464
Having you as my son.

1228
01:27:10,701 --> 01:27:13,070
That was a long time ago.

1229
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:17,240
No, Simba. That is forever.

1230
01:27:20,144 --> 01:27:21,778
Please.

1231
01:27:21,812 --> 01:27:23,881
Don't leave me again.

1232
01:27:23,914 --> 01:27:26,050
I never left you.

1233
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:28,384
And never will.

1234
01:27:29,752 --> 01:27:32,422
Remember who you are.

1235
01:27:34,724 --> 01:27:36,926
Remember.

1236
01:27:46,269 --> 01:27:49,139
And so, I ask again.

1237
01:27:49,173 --> 01:27:50,406
Who are you?

1238
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,977
I am Simba.

1239
01:27:55,011 --> 01:27:57,413

1257
01:29:49,958 --> 01:29:52,127
So, what are you
gonna do?

1258
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,995
My father once
told me to protect

1259
01:29:54,029 --> 01:29:55,764
everything
the light touches.

1260
01:29:55,797 --> 01:29:58,733
If I don't fight for it,
who will?

1261
01:30:00,068 --> 01:30:01,636
I will.

1262
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:03,404
It's going to be dangerous.

1263
01:30:03,438 --> 01:30:05,440
Danger? Ha!

1264
01:30:05,473 --> 01:30:08,877
I laugh
in the face of danger.

1265
01:30:11,378 --> 01:30:14,716
It can't be!

1266
01:30:14,749 --> 01:30:16,885
Hello, Zazu.

1267
01:30:16,918 --> 01:30:18,787
Your Majesty.

1268
01:30:19,221 --> 01:30:20,554
Welcome home.

1269
01:30:23,992 --> 01:30:24,826
We're here!

1270
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,527
Oh, everyone, calm down.
We're here.

1271
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,462
The backup has arrived!

1272
01:30:28,495 --> 01:30:29,998
What are you guys
doing here?

1273
01:30:30,031 --> 01:30:33,500
- Um, we were not worried!
- Um... No, not worried.

1274
01:30:33,534 --> 01:30:35,303
- 'Cause no worries.
- Nope. Hakuna matata.

1275
01:30:35,337 --> 01:30:37,504
We were concerned,
because...

1276
01:30:37,538 --> 01:30:38,974
Because, you know...

1277
01:30:39,007 --> 01:30:40,374
You're our friend.

1278
01:30:40,407 --> 01:30:43,377
What about the meaningless
line of indifference?

1279
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:44,712
Well, we were thinking...

1280
01:30:44,745 --> 01:30:47,082
- maybe it curves a little bit.
- That's a good point.

1281
01:30:47,115 --> 01:30:48,316
I mean, Simba, look,

1282
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:50,384
I'm happy to admit
when Pumbaa's wrong...

1283
01:30:50,417 --> 01:30:51,452
and this is one of
those instances.

1284
01:30:51,485 --> 01:30:52,620
What? That wasn't
my thing.

1285
01:30:52,653 --> 01:30:54,055
You told me
about the line.

1286
01:30:54,089 --> 01:30:55,023
Wait, hold on.

1287
01:30:55,056 --> 01:30:58,159
Now, this is the place
you're fighting for?

1288
01:30:58,193 --> 01:31:00,494
Yes, Timon.
This is my home.

1289
01:31:00,527 --> 01:31:02,796
Is it behind
that terrifying rock?

1290
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:04,798
Talk about
your fixer-upper.

1291
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,368
I like what
you've done with it,

1292
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,270
although a bit heavy
on the carcass.

1293
01:31:08,303 --> 01:31:10,105
Hey, hey, look.
A bird.

1294
01:31:10,138 --> 01:31:13,174
Timon, Pumbaa, this is Zazu.

1295
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:15,210
Oh, wow!
It's a puffin.

1296
01:31:15,243 --> 01:31:16,710
Charming.

1297
01:31:18,313 --> 01:31:20,748
Simba, we are with you
until the end.

1298
01:31:20,781 --> 01:31:23,150
We are at your service,
my liege!

1299
01:31:23,717 --> 01:31:25,419
Follow me.

1300
01:31:39,466 --> 01:31:41,101
Hyenas everywhere.

1301
01:31:41,135 --> 01:31:42,404
I hope
it's a quick death.

1302
01:31:42,436 --> 01:31:43,771
You know, just not
a lot of chewing.

1303
01:31:43,804 --> 01:31:45,105
What's your plan
for getting us

1304
01:31:45,139 --> 01:31:46,473
past the slobbering guards?

1305
01:31:46,907 --> 01:31:48,909
Live bait.

1306
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,748
That's a great idea.

1307
01:31:54,782 --> 01:31:57,117
Those guys could never
resist fresh meat.

1308
01:31:57,151 --> 01:32:00,453
So all we need to do is find
something that's, like, big...

1309
01:32:00,486 --> 01:32:02,623
and plump, and juicy.

1310
01:32:02,656 --> 01:32:04,959
Maybe like a gnu?

1311
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:08,561
Why is everyone
looking at me?

1312
01:32:13,968 --> 01:32:16,370
It is with deepest pride

1313
01:32:16,403 --> 01:32:18,538
and greatest pleasure...

1314
01:32:18,571 --> 01:32:21,976
that we proudly present...

1315
01:32:22,009 --> 01:32:23,676
your dinner.

1316
01:32:26,113 --> 01:32:29,782
♪ Be our guest ♪

1317
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:35,822
It's working, Pumbaa!

1318
01:33:08,288 --> 01:33:11,190
My old friend.

1319
01:33:11,224 --> 01:33:13,760
Sarabi,
why put yourself through this?

1320
01:33:13,793 --> 01:33:16,463
All you have to do
is be my queen.

1321
01:33:16,497 --> 01:33:17,964
You're suffering
for what?

1322
01:33:17,997 --> 01:33:20,166
The memory of a life
you once knew?

1323
01:33:20,199 --> 01:33:23,102
A king you once loved?

1324
01:33:23,136 --> 01:33:26,739
I tried to make you understand
what a true king can be.

1325
01:33:26,773 --> 01:33:31,611
Scar, a true king's power
is his compassion.

1326
01:33:31,644 --> 01:33:33,813
I am ten times
the king Mufasa was!

1327
01:33:33,846 --> 01:33:36,716
You are nothing
compared to Mufasa!

1328
01:33:47,994 --> 01:33:49,328
Mufasa?

1329
01:33:49,362 --> 01:33:50,629
It can't be.

1330
01:33:50,662 --> 01:33:52,965
Get away from my mother.

1331
01:33:55,435 --> 01:33:56,969
Simba.

1332
01:33:59,305 --> 01:34:01,407
You're alive?

1333
01:34:01,441 --> 01:34:04,077
How can that be?

1334
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:06,245
I'm here, Mother.

1335
01:34:06,279 --> 01:34:07,380
I'm home.

1336
01:34:07,413 --> 01:34:09,148
Simba...

1337
01:34:09,182 --> 01:34:11,317
I'm so happy to see you.

1338
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:12,552
Alive.

1339
01:34:13,819 --> 01:34:15,787
Give me one good reason

1340
01:34:15,821 --> 01:34:17,823
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1341
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:20,226
I can give you more than one.

1342
01:34:20,259 --> 01:34:21,626
You see...

1343
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:23,595
they think I'm king.

1344
01:34:26,031 --> 01:34:27,899
Well, we don't.

1345
01:34:28,834 --> 01:34:31,069
Your reign is over, Scar.

1346
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:34,606
Simba is the rightful king!

1347
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:38,377
If you wanna get him,
you have to get through us.

1348
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:40,480
Are you with me, lions?

1349
01:34:43,748 --> 01:34:45,784
The choice is yours, Scar.

1350
01:34:45,817 --> 01:34:47,853
Step down or fight.

1351
01:34:47,886 --> 01:34:52,023
Must this all end
in violence?

1352
01:34:52,057 --> 01:34:56,061
I'd hate to be responsible for
the death of a family member.

1353
01:34:56,094 --> 01:34:59,064
To feel the shame
of knowing...

1354
01:34:59,097 --> 01:35:01,900
I took the life
of someone I love.

1355
01:35:01,933 --> 01:35:03,668
I put all that behind me.

1356
01:35:03,702 --> 01:35:06,972
But have they
put it behind them?

1357
01:35:07,005 --> 01:35:09,941
Do your faithful subjects
know what you've done?

1358
01:35:09,975 --> 01:35:11,676
What is he talking about?

1359
01:35:11,710 --> 01:35:15,380
So you haven't told them
your little secret?

1360
01:35:15,413 --> 01:35:17,949
Well, Simba...

1361
01:35:17,983 --> 01:35:21,219
now's your chance
to confess.

1362
01:35:21,253 --> 01:35:24,956
Tell them who's responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1363
01:35:33,131 --> 01:35:35,233
It was me.

1364
01:35:35,267 --> 01:35:37,135
It's not true.

1365
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:40,238
Tell me it's not true.

1366
01:35:40,272 --> 01:35:42,140
It's true. I'm sorry.

1367
01:35:42,174 --> 01:35:44,109
He admits it.

1368
01:35:44,142 --> 01:35:45,043
Murderer!

1369
01:35:45,076 --> 01:35:47,078
No, no.
It was an accident.

1370
01:35:47,112 --> 01:35:49,147
If it weren't for you
the king would be alive.

1371
01:35:49,181 --> 01:35:52,117
It's your fault he's dead!
Do you deny it?

1372
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:53,351
I'm not a murderer.

1373
01:35:53,385 --> 01:35:55,920
We should believe a son who
takes the life of a father?

1374
01:35:55,954 --> 01:35:58,756
We should believe a son who
takes the life of a king?

1375
01:35:58,789 --> 01:36:01,293
A son who abandons
his mother?

1376
01:36:01,326 --> 01:36:02,760
No. I'm...

1377
01:36:02,793 --> 01:36:05,796
You're what? Say it!
Are you the king?

1378
01:36:05,829 --> 01:36:07,065
No. No, I'm...

1379
01:36:07,098 --> 01:36:08,600
- Are you the king?
- No, I'm...

1380
01:36:08,633 --> 01:36:10,368
- You're what? Say it!
- I'm...

1381
01:36:12,069 --> 01:36:13,371
I'm nothing.

1382
01:36:13,405 --> 01:36:14,972
Then bow to your king!

1383
01:36:17,676 --> 01:36:18,943
Simba!

1384
01:36:34,392 --> 01:36:36,595
This looks familiar.

1385
01:36:36,628 --> 01:36:41,265
Where have I
seen this before?

1386
01:36:41,298 --> 01:36:44,868
Oh, yes,
I remember.

1387
01:36:44,902 --> 01:36:48,005
This is the way Mufasa
looked before he died.

1388
01:36:48,038 --> 01:36:51,408
I looked down...

1389
01:36:51,442 --> 01:36:54,478
saw the fear in his eyes.

1390
01:36:57,748 --> 01:37:00,985
And here's
my little secret.

1391
01:37:01,018 --> 01:37:04,121
I killed Mufasa.

1392
01:37:10,628 --> 01:37:13,330
No!

1393
01:37:18,269 --> 01:37:19,503
My father!

1394
01:37:19,536 --> 01:37:20,571
Your own brother!

1395
01:37:20,604 --> 01:37:21,905
How could you?

1396
01:37:21,939 --> 01:37:23,941
First he kills Mufasa...

1397
01:37:23,974 --> 01:37:25,643
and now
he wants to kill me!

1398
01:37:25,676 --> 01:37:26,977
You killed him!

1399
01:37:27,011 --> 01:37:28,545
Tell them the truth!

1400
01:37:28,579 --> 01:37:30,314
Don't believe
his lies!

1401
01:37:30,347 --> 01:37:31,415
Scar...

1402
01:37:31,448 --> 01:37:35,319
you told us you didn't get
to the gorge in time.

1403
01:37:35,352 --> 01:37:36,453
That's true!

1404
01:37:36,487 --> 01:37:40,024
Then how did you see
the look in Mufasa's eyes?

1405
01:37:41,692 --> 01:37:43,127
Murderer!

1406
01:37:43,661 --> 01:37:45,062
Kill them all!

1407
01:37:51,901 --> 01:37:53,537
Lions, attack!

1408
01:38:08,385 --> 01:38:10,153
Simba!

1409
01:38:15,693 --> 01:38:16,993
Pumbaa, I think we lost them.

1410
01:38:17,026 --> 01:38:18,662
That was terrifying.

1411
01:38:19,929 --> 01:38:22,298
Do you hear a low growl?

1412
01:38:22,332 --> 01:38:25,301
Looks like we'll be
having pig for dinner.

1413
01:38:25,335 --> 01:38:27,303
Plump and chubby.

1414
01:38:27,738 --> 01:38:29,105
Chubby?

1415
01:38:29,138 --> 01:38:30,406
Did he just
call me chubby?

1416
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:31,407
Uh-oh.

1417
01:38:31,441 --> 01:38:34,010
It sounded a lot like
he just said "chubby".

1418
01:38:34,043 --> 01:38:35,978
Which would be
a mistake because...

1419
01:38:36,012 --> 01:38:38,481
I will not be made to feel
ashamed of who I am!

1420
01:38:38,514 --> 01:38:39,549
Oh, boy.

1421
01:38:39,583 --> 01:38:41,517
I may run from hyenas...

1422
01:38:41,551 --> 01:38:43,853
but I will always
fight a bully!

1423
01:38:52,061 --> 01:38:53,596
- You feel better, Pumbaa?
- I do.

1424
01:38:53,629 --> 01:38:54,697
You got that
out of your system?

1425
01:38:54,732 --> 01:38:56,232
I did.

1426
01:39:10,179 --> 01:39:13,649
Now, this is a meal I've
waited my whole life for.

1427
01:39:14,517 --> 01:39:16,853
I've been waiting too.

1428
01:39:16,885 --> 01:39:19,055
And I'm not a cub anymore!

1429
01:39:23,992 --> 01:39:26,295
For king and country!

1430
01:39:28,798 --> 01:39:29,931
It's the bird!

1431
01:39:29,965 --> 01:39:31,467
I got him! I got him!

1432
01:39:32,934 --> 01:39:34,470
Tally-ho!

1433
01:39:34,504 --> 01:39:35,605
Oh! No! He's got me!

1434
01:39:35,638 --> 01:39:37,005
He's got me! Ooh!

1435
01:39:39,908 --> 01:39:41,444
Get that bird!

1436
01:39:46,214 --> 01:39:48,584
Please! Let's discuss this.

1437
01:40:20,982 --> 01:40:22,951
That never gets old!

1438
01:41:35,022 --> 01:41:36,391
It's over, Scar.

1439
01:41:40,227 --> 01:41:41,930
Have mercy.
I beg you.

1440
01:41:41,963 --> 01:41:43,598
Mercy?

1441
01:41:43,632 --> 01:41:45,199
After what you did?

1442
01:41:45,232 --> 01:41:47,167
It was the hyenas.

1443
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:49,804
Those revolting scavengers
made me do it.

1444
01:41:49,838 --> 01:41:51,973
I was planning
on killing them all.

1445
01:41:53,207 --> 01:41:55,509
You fooled the hyenas.

1446
01:41:55,544 --> 01:41:57,411
Just like you fooled me.

1447
01:42:00,414 --> 01:42:01,549
Simba...

1448
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:04,084
you wouldn't kill
your only uncle.

1449
01:42:05,687 --> 01:42:06,788
No, Scar.

1450
01:42:08,589 --> 01:42:10,224
I'm not like you.

1451
01:42:10,926 --> 01:42:12,827
Oh, Simba...

1452
01:42:12,861 --> 01:42:15,195
you are truly noble.

1453
01:42:15,229 --> 01:42:17,097
And I will make it up
to you.

1454
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:20,134
Just tell me
how I can prove myself.

1455
01:42:20,167 --> 01:42:22,837
Tell me what
you want me to do.

1456
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,473
Run.

1457
01:42:28,776 --> 01:42:31,278
Run away, Scar.

1458
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:34,582
Run away
and never return.

1459
01:42:36,051 --> 01:42:37,518
Yes.

1460
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:40,354
