00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,155
Have a look over here.

167
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,491
This might interest you.

168
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,998
INDY: Well, it's sandstone.
Christian symbol.

169
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,417
Early Latin text.

170
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,753
Mid-12th century, I should think.

171
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,671
That was our assessment, as well.

172
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:08,839
Where did this come from?

173
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,884
My engineers unearthed it
in the mountain region north of Ankara

174
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,178
while excavating for copper.

175
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,764
Can you translate the inscription?

176
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,725
(READING LATIN)

177
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:23,562
"...who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the Lord,

178
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,607
"will have a spring inside him

179
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,568
"welling up for eternal life.

180
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:33,322
"Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

181
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,532
"in the place where you dwell.

182
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,535
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

183
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:42,039
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon,

184
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,584
"to the temple where the cup that...

185
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:53,091
"Where the cup that holds the blood
of Jesus Christ resides forever."

186
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,262
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

187
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,809
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

188
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,646
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

189
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,649
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

190
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,485
The Arthur legend.

191
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,987
I've heard this bedtime story before.

192
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,864
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

193
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:18,700
The gift of youth
to whoever drinks from the Grail.

194
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:21,161
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

195
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,496
An old man's dream.

196
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,041
Every man's dream,
including your father's, I believe.

197
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,172
Grail lore is his hobby.

198
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,841
He's a teacher of medieval literature.

199
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,759
The one the students hope
they don't get.

200
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,221
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.

201
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,431
DONOVAN: Be along in a moment, dear.

202
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,730
Hard to resist, isn't it?

203
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:52,401
The Holy Grail's final resting place
described in detail.

204
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,319
What good is it?

205
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:58,198
This Grail tablet speaks of deserts
and mountains and canyons.

206
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,700
It's pretty vague.

207
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,410
Where do you want to start looking?

208
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,829
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

209
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,539
but the entire top portion is missing.

210
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,959
Just the same, an attempt to recover
the Grail is currently underway.

211
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,923
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

212
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,051
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

213
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:21,013
it disappeared,
and was lost for a thousand years

214
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:24,850
before it was found again
by three knights of the First Crusade.

215
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,393
Three brothers, to be exact.

216
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,478
I've heard this one, as well.

217
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,606
Two of these brothers
walked out of the desert

218
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,734
150 years after having found the Grail

219
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,861
and began the long journey
back to France,

220
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,988
but only one of them made it.

221
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,450
And before dying of extreme old age,

222
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:46,163
he supposedly imparted his tale to a...
to a Franciscan friar, I think.

223
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,999
Not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.

224
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:54,129
This is the manuscript in which
the friar chronicled the knight's story.

225
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,174
It doesn't reveal the location of
the Grail, I'm afraid,

226
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,051
but the knight promised
that two markers

227
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,677
that had been left behind would.

228
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:04,389
This tablet is one of those markers.

229
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,683
It proves the knight's story is true.

230
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,353
But as you pointed out, it's incomplete.

231
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,397
Now, the second marker is entombed
with the knight's dead brother.

232
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,567
Our project leader
believes that tomb to be located

233
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,320
within the city of Venice, Italy.

234
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,783
As you can now see, Dr. Jones,

235
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,869
we're about to complete a great quest

236
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,997
that began almost 2,000 years ago.

237
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,458
We're only one step away.

238
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,711
That's usually when the ground falls out
from underneath your feet.

239
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,422
You could be more right than you know.

240
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:38,799
Yes?

241
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,717
We've hit a snag.

242
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:45,764
Our project leader has vanished,
along with all his research.

243
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:49,351
We received a cable from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

244
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:53,146
who has no idea of his whereabouts
or what's become of him.

245
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,900
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

246
00:21:57,275 --> 00:22:00,070
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

247
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,408
You've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.

248
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,203
Why don't you try my father?

249
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,080
We already have.

250
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,125
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

251
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,014
BRODY: Your father and I have been
friends since time began.

252
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,306
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

253
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,100
I've watched the two of you grow apart.

254
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,185
I've never seen you this concerned
about him before.

255
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,395
Dad?

256
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,605
He's an academic, a bookworm.
He's not a field man.

257
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:36,773
Dad?

258
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,442
Dad?

259
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,193
Dear God.

260
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,324
BRODY: What has the old fool
got himself into now?

261
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,412
I don't know, but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

262
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,164
Dad?

263
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:55,500
It's today's mail, and it's been opened.

264
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,171
Mail.

265
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,465
That's it, Marcus.

266
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,427
Venice, Italy.

267
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:10,140
BRODY: What is it?

268
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,312
INDY: It's Dad's Grail diary.

269
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,317
Every clue he followed.
Every discovery he made.

270
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,903
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

271
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,573
This is his whole life.

272
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,659
Why would he have sent this to me?

273
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,161
I don't know,

274
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,872
but someone must want it pretty badly.

275
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,926
Do you believe, Marcus?

276
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,816
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?

277
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:06,780
The search for the Cup of Christ
is the search for the divine in all of us.

278
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,866
But if you want facts, Indy,
I've none to give you.

279
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:14,454
At my age, I'm prepared to
take a few things on faith.

280
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:21,545
Call Donovan, Marcus.

281
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,548
Tell him I'll take that ticket
to Venice now.

282
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,218
I'll tell him we'll take two

283
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,976
All right, tell me what's going to happen
when we get to Venice.

284
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,019
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

285
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,521
- Schneider?
- I maintain an apartment in Venice.

286
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,647
It's at your disposal.

287
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,649
Oh, well, that's good. Thank you.

288
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,070
Dr. Jones, good luck.

289
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,907
Now be very careful.
Don't trust anybody.

290
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,027
Signora ? Signorina ?

291
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:37,454
- Ah, Venice...
- Yes.

292
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,625
How will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider when we see him?

293
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,753
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

294
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,171
WOMAN: Dr. Jones?

295
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,965
INDY: Yes?

296
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,301
I knew it was you.

297
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,137
You have your father's eyes.

298
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:59,434
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

299
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,687
Looks like the best parts
have already been spoken for.

300
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,690
- Marcus Brody?
- That's right.

301
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,525
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

302
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:08,777
How do you do?

303
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:12,656
ELSA: The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

304
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:15,242
He was very close to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

305
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,202
(LAUGHS) I've never seen him
so excited.

306
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:19,621
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

307
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,706
INDY: Who? Attila the Professor?

308
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,960
He was never giddy,
even when he was a schoolboy.

309
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,671
FrÃ©ulein, will you permit me?

310
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,756
- I usually don't.
- I usually don't, either.

311
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,259
- In that case, I permit you.
- It would make me very happy.

312
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,678
But I'm already sad.
By tomorrow, it will have faded.

313
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:35,762
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

314
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:38,181
I hate to interrupt you,
but the reason we're here...

315
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,225
Yes. I have something to show you.

316
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,102
I left your father working in the library.

317
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:45,272
He sent me to the map section
to fetch an ancient plan of the city.

318
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,191
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

319
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,777
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

320
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,861
Roman numerals.

321
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,239
ELSA: Here is the library.

322
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:57,242
INDY: That doesn't look
much like a library.

323
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:59,452
BRODY: Looks like a converted church.

324
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,621
In this case, it's the literal truth.

325
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:03,456
We are on holy ground.

326
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,168
These columns over here
were brought back as spoils of war

327
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:10,547
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

328
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,508
Now, please excuse me.

329
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,302
The library's closing in a few moments.

330
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:18,346
I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.

331
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:24,561
Marcus, I've seen this window before.

332
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:25,645
Where?

333
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,897
Right here, in Dad's diary.

334
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:37,657
INDY: You see?

335
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,535
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals.

336
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,288
Dad was onto something here.

337
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,206
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

338
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,250
but we still don't know what they mean.

339
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,835
Dad sent me this diary for a reason.

340
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,629
Until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

341
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:52,922
Find something?

342
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,008
Yes. Three, seven and ten.

343
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,594
That window seems to be
the source of the Roman numerals.

344
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:59,262
My God, I must be blind.

345
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,515
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

346
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,559
he was looking for the tomb itself.

347
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:05,977
Don't you get it?

348
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,021
The tomb is somewhere in the library.

349
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,023
You said yourself it used to be a church.

350
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,232
Look.

351
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,692
Three.

352
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,196
Three.

353
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:17,739
Seven.

354
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,366
Seven. Ten.

355
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:22,285
And ten.

356
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,162
Now where's the ten?

357
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,791
Look around for the ten.

358
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,593
INDY: Three and seven.

359
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,762
Seven and seven

Ten.

362

Except he's lost, and I'm not.

368
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,563
Lower me down.

369

Right.

373
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:55,313
600 years before the Crusades.

374
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,899
The Christians would have
dug their own passages

375
00:30:57,982 --> 00:31:00,193
and burial chambers centuries later.

376

INDY: That's right.

that's where we'll find him.

It's petroleum.

385
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:21,691
I should sink a well down here
and retire.

Look.

The engraving on the shield,
it's the same as on the Grail tablet.

The shield is the second marker.

of the Grail tablet.

Wouldn't it be wonderful

He never would have
made it past the rats.

Is it for His glory, or for yours?

It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta"?

The knights of the First Crusade

"Across the desert
and through the mountain

"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."

00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,636
Your father would know.

464
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:57,558
Your father did know.
Look. He made a map.

465

He must have pieced it together
from clues scattered through

the whole history of the Grail quest.

A map with no names.

468
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,443
Now, he knew there was a city
with an oasis due east, here.

469
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,362
He knew the course turned south
through the desert to a river,

470
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:12,281
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

Straight to the canyon.

472

He knew everything
except where to begin,

473
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:18,120
the name of the city.

You didn't trust me.

more than he was looking for.

I'm going to continue to do things

00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:05,201
to the secret
Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

652
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:06,286
So it did.

653
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:08,121
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

654
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:09,581
We must have these pages back.

655
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:10,916
You're wasting your breath.

656
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,792
He won't tell us,

657
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,711
and he doesn't have to.

658
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:18,340
It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

659
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,842
He's given them to Marcus Brody.

660
00:54:20,926 --> 00:54:21,968
HENRY: Marcus?

661
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:24,429
You didn't drag poor Marcus along,
did you?

662
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:25,931
He's not up to the challenge.

663
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:27,474
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

664
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:28,683
We'll find him.

665
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:30,435
The hell you will.

666
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:32,187
He's got a two-day head start on you,

667
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,688
which is more than he needs.

668
00:54:34,189 --> 00:54:36,107
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

669
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:37,275
from here to the Sudan.

670
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,028
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

671
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,947
He'll blend in, disappear.

672
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,865
You'll never see him again.

673
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:46,534
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

674
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:49,788
Does anyone here speak English?

675
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:50,956
Or even ancient Greek?

676
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:52,207
Water? No, thank you, sir.

677
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,625
No. Fish make love in it.

678
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:56,962
Goodness me. Thank you so much.
No, I don't like that.

679
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:58,213
No, I really don't want...

680
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,465
No, no, thank you very much.

681
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:02,550
No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.

682
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:05,762
Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?

683
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,305
Mr. Brody!

684
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:08,556
Sallah. What a relief.

685
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,976
Marcus Brody, sir.

686
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:12,769
- But where is Indy?
- He's in Austria.

687
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:14,312
A slight detour.

688
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:15,438
You are on your own?

689
00:55:15,522 --> 00:55:18,233
Yes, but don't panic.
Everything's under control.

690
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,568
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

691
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:22,487
Yes, of course.
But where are we going?

692
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,030
This map will show you.

693
00:55:24,114 --> 00:55:26,074
It was drawn by...

694
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:27,993
Mr. Brody.

695
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:29,911
Welcome to lskenderun.

696
00:55:30,078 --> 00:55:31,997
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

697
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,206
has sent a car for you.

698
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:35,583
Well, your servant, sir.

699
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:36,918
And I am his.

700
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:38,962
Follow me, please.

701
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:41,006
My reputation precedes me.

702
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:43,258
There is no museum in lskenderun.

703
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:44,718
Papers, please.

704
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:47,178
Papers? Of course.

705
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,722
- Run.
- Yes.

706
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:50,557
Papers. Got it here.

707
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,267
Just finished reading it myself.

708
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,519
- Run.
- Yes.

709
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:56,521
Egyptian Mail, morning edition. Run.

710
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:57,814
Did you say...

711
00:55:57,939 --> 00:55:59,357
Run!

712
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:16,041
Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!

713
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:19,127
Find the back door! Find the back door!

Intolerable.

715
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,563
Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin.

716
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:40,440
You must return immediately.

717
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:43,359
- A rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture.
- So?

718
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:47,614
Your presence on the platform
is requested at the highest level.

719
00:56:47,697 --> 00:56:50,700
Thank you, Herr Oberst.
I will meet you at lskenderun.

720
00:56:50,784 --> 00:56:52,702
Take this diary
to the Reichmuseum in Berlin.

721
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:55,330
It will show them our progress,
ahead of schedule.

722
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:57,832
Without the map,
I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.

723
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:59,167
Let me kill them now.

724
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,335
No.

725
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:02,253
If we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

726
00:57:02,337 --> 00:57:03,922
we'll need them alive.

727
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:06,508
Always do what the doctor orders.

728
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:15,850
Don't look at me like that.

729
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:18,520
We both wanted the Grail.

730
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:20,522
I would have done anything to get it.

731
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:22,607
You would have done the same.

732
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,609
I'm sorry you think so.

733
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,415
I can't forget how wonderful it was.

734
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:40,542
Thank you.

735
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:42,544
It was rather wonderful.

That's how Austrians say good-bye.

And this is how we say good-bye
in Germany, Dr. Jones.

So did I.

743

Let's try and get these ropes loose.

744

We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.

745
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:37,640
You said he had two days' start.
That he would blend in. Disappear.

00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,184
Are you kidding? I made that up.

747
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:42,478
You know Marcus.
He got lost once in his own museum.

748
00:58:44,856 --> 00:58:47,525
Can you try and reach
my left jacket pocket?

01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:03,919
Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.

818
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:05,796
What final challenge?

819
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,674
Three devices of such lethal cunning.

820
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:10,384
- Booby traps?
- Oh, yes.

821
01:06:11,844 --> 01:06:15,306
But I found the clues that
will safely take us through,

822
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:17,600
in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.

so that I wouldn't have to remember.

and you want me to go to Berlin?

- Yes.
