1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

<i>If you had wings to lift you</i>

00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,764
<i>and the Second Star your guide,</i>

4
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:59,937

5
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:04,524
<i>Yet past the Summer Meadow
and beyond the Autumn Wood,</i>

6
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:10,489
<i>lies an icy land of secrets,
a world misunderstood.</i>

7
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:16,912
<i>But if your mind is open
and your heart just has to know,</i>

8
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:22,501
<i>your wings can take you farther

22
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:30,485
Look sharp, everyone!

23
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,487
The snowy owls will soon be arriving

24
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:35,741
to take the snowflake baskets
to the Winter Woods.

25
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:39,494
Lucinda, stop noodling
and start tinkering.

26
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,001
Is that the last load?

27
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:48,003
- Thanks, Cheese.

28
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:51,965
Basket weaving
is my favorite thing, Bobble.

29
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:53,884
Really? I'm partial to macramé.

30
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,719
Morning, Clank. Morning, Bobble.

31
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:56,845
Morning!

32
00:02:57,429 --> 00:02:59,431
That should be enough
to finish the snowflake baskets.

33
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:00,849
Aye, that will do her.

34
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:02,684
- Thanks!

35
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:05,270
Clanky.
- Oh! Sorry.

36
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:07,147
I can't believe
we make the baskets,

37
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,649
but don't get to take them
to the Winter Fairies.

38
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,486
I mean, wouldn't you want to
go into the Winter Woods?

39
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:16,865
Oh, we wouldn't last a day in that cold.

40
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:19,743
Besides, I'm afraid of glaciers.

41
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:20,952
Glaciers?

42
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:23,413
They're known for their stealth.

43
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:25,415
He's never actually seen one.

44
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:26,833
You never do!

45
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:30,045
The snowy owls!

46
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:34,049
Places, everyone!

47
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:35,926
Clank, Bobble, get that basket up.

48
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:37,719
Right! Got it, Fairy Mary!

49
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:38,970
Start the pulley!

50
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:05,997
Ooh! Newcomer.

51
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:22,806
Wow.

52
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,891
The final shipment order.

53
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:29,354
Oh, goodness! They need
20 more baskets for tomorrow's pickup.

54
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,165
There's a whole other world over there.

55
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:52,502
Well done, everyone!
The first shipment is headed for Winter.

56
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:54,838
But there's much more to do
for tomorrow's pickup,

57
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,757
so this is no time to rest on your laurels.

58
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:00,886
Lucinda, get off your laurel
and get to work.

59
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:06,641
Look out!

60
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:11,021
Runaway bunny!

61
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:16,818
No!

62
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:20,155
- Got you!
- Thanks, Tink.

63
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:21,656
No problem, Fawn.

64
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,202
Come on, little guy.
It's still a long way to the Winter Woods.

65
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,412
Oh, you're taking the animals today?

66
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:28,538
Trying to.

67
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:30,499
It's time for them to cross the border,

68
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:32,834
but this little guy is a handful.

69
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:35,420
Hey, uh, how about if I help?

70
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,424
Slow down! Slow down!

71
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:42,177
- Need some help?
- Nope. Doing fine.

72
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,970
That lost thing really is handy.

73
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:45,013
Yeah.

74
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:47,307
Heel, Hoppy, heel! Slow down!

75
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,317
Wow.

76
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,112
Oh, don't be scared, little fellow.

77
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:03,448
We'll let the weasels go first.

78
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:07,953
Come on. Come on.
Come on!

79
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:12,040
So, how far do we take the animals in?

80
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:14,709
- Uh, Tink, we don't cross the border.
- Huh?

81
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:16,211
We just help the animals cross.

82
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:20,382
But I thought Animal Fairies
got to cross with the animals.

83
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,384
Tink, it's freezing over there.

84
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:25,345
Besides, no Warm Fairies
are allowed in the Winter Woods.

85
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,889
Just like Winter Fairies
aren't allowed over here.

86
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:30,850
Who made up that rule?

87
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:33,728
I think it was the Lord of Winter.

88
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:35,021
Winter has a lord?

89
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:36,898
All right, guys. You ready?

90
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,994
- Wow.
- Pretty great, huh?

91
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:52,831
It's incredible.

92
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:55,584
They get their winter coats
to protect them from the cold.

93
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:59,629
Your turn. Go on.

94
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:09,180
Go on, now. Follow your brothers.

95
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:29,451
Bye-bye!

96
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:31,369
All right, big guy.

97
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,204
- Oh, no.

98
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:36,124
No hibernating yet.

99
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:37,667
- You do that in Winter!

100
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:40,712
Come on. Come on!

101
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,257
Wake up. Wake up.

102
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:45,925
Oh...

103
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:47,302
Come on.

104
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,220
- Wake up.

105
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,097
Rise and shine.

106
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:54,392
Ooh!

107
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,164
Ooh!

108
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:35,934
Oh...

109
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,980
Tink!

110
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:43,149
Tink!

111
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:44,609
- Tinker Bell!
- What?

112
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:53,159
Oh, Tink! I told you,
we're not allowed to cross.

113
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:56,746
Your wings.

114
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,164
I know!

115
00:08:58,248 --> 00:08:59,708
They were sparkling.

116
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,334
They're freezing!

117
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:03,169
We'd better get you
to a Healing Talent Fairy.

118
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:04,462
- But...
- Come on.

119
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,761
May I help you?

120
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,012
How much longer?

121
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:16,808
I told you,
a rainbow collision is not an emergency.

122
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,227
But the purple's starting to itch.

123
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,729
Take a seat.

124
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,236
Oh! Snapdragon, right?

125
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,362
Mmm-hmm.

126
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:31,364
Not an emergency. Plant it over there.

127
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:32,407
Thank you.

128
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,784
Hurry, girls.
What if we're too late?

129
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,371
- Oh! Sorry. Do you know...
- Window.

130
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,670
- Uh, uh, uh, uh!

131
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:47,088
Patient's name?

132
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,548
Tinker Bell.

133
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,009
Oh, yes. The border crosser. She's...

134
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,552
Frozen solid?

135
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:54,804
- Room two.
- Oh, my.

136
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:56,139
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

137
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:57,932
- This way!
- Come on, girls. Hurry.

138
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:59,434
She's right over here.
Room two.

139
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:00,852
- There she is.
- Tink!

140
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:03,271
We got here as quick as we could.

141
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:04,939
We did have to stop at reception.

142
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:07,233
- Did you really cross?

143
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:09,068
Well, did you?

144
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:10,236
Shh!

145
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:13,823
- Hmm...
- Whoa.

146
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:14,908
Shh!

147
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,951
Mmm-hmm.

148
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:21,039
Okay. You're all warmed up.
Let's test your wings.

149
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:22,248
Oh! Sure.

150
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:23,333
Open.

151
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,251
Mmm. Close.

152
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:27,378
And try a little flap.

153
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:29,422
A flutter.

154
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:31,758
Can you give me a flitter?

155
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:36,554
Okay. Well, I don't see anything
unusual. Your wings appear to be fine.

156
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:41,226
But what about the sparkling?

157
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:43,353
It must have been the light
reflecting off the snow.

158
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:44,437
- But...
- You should have never

159
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:45,480
crossed the border.

160
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:48,191
Winter is too cold
for our Warm Fairy wings.

161
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:51,277
Now, to be safe,
I want you to take two sunflower seeds

162
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,905
and come back if there is any problem.

163
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:56,407
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

164
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:58,284
We were worried, Tink.

165
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:00,662
Oh! You are so lucky
nothing happened to your wings.

166
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,121
Can you imagine?

167
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:05,124
But something did happen
They sparkled!

168
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,378
But you heard her. It was just the light
reflecting off the snow.

169
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:11,756
No, it wasn't. They actually lit up.

170
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,385
It was brighter than a thousand fireflies.

171
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:18,096
You saw it. Didn't you, Fawn?

172
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:19,305
No.

173
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,809
You don't believe me?

174
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,352
Who... Um...

175
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:25,937
Uh... No?

176
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:30,233
Look, you guys, it happened.
It felt like...

177
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,235
- Like...
- Like What?

178
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:37,282
Like the Winter Woods was calling me.

179
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:39,325
You know?

180
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:45,373
Not really.
Get the doctor.

181
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:50,461
Animal Fairy Books,
101 Uses for Pixie Dust,

182
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:52,171
Beauty and the Bees...

183
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:54,299
There's got to be a wing book
here somewhere.

184
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,802
<i>Rules for Rainbow Riding.</i> No, not that.

185
00:11:58,386 --> 00:11:59,888
Huh? Hey.

186
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:01,848
Someone's been eating the books!

187
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:04,851
Bookworms.

188
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,186
Oh. What's this?

189
00:12:07,437 --> 00:12:08,438
Ah!

190
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:10,273
Light reading.

191
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:13,192
Dustology, windology...

192
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:14,319
A-ha!

193
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,821
Wingology. That's got to have it.

194
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,200
Oh!

195
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:27,624
Got you!

196
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:28,917
Ahem.

197
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:30,793
Sorry.

198
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,961
Mmm-hmm.

199
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:35,214
Okay, let's see.

200
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:37,383
Wing care. Wing washing. Wing tips.

201
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,802
"Don't get them wet."
Everybody knows that.

202
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:43,431
Sizes, shapes, flapping, fluttering.

203
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,808
Sparkling! I knew it!

204
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:47,143
Oh!

205
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,272
Sorry. Found it!

206
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:53,316
Huh?

207
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,109
Oh, no.

208
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,529
Thanks a lot.

209
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,200
Hmm.

210
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:03,993
Okay.

211
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:08,665
"Sparkling wings.
When a most incredible..."

212
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:11,042
"...that the sparkle... There were two."

213
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,168
Huh?

214
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,796
"That the sparkle... There were two."

215
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,258
Two wings? Two feet?
Two what?

216
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:23,596
- Psst.
- Oh!

217
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,723
- Yes?
- Hey.

218
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:28,893
Do you know anything
about sparkling wings?

219
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:31,980
No. The bookworm ate that page.

220
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:33,648
Yeah, I know.

221
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,650
But the Keeper does.

222
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,527
The Keeper? Who's the Keeper?

223
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:43,199
He writes the books.
He is the keeper of all fairy knowledge.

224
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:46,577
That's perfect. Is he here?
I have to talk to him.

225
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:51,582
I would give anything
to talk to him. But you can't.

226
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,334
Why not?

227
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:54,711
Because he's a Winter Fairy.

228
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:58,881
In order to talk to him, you would have
to go to the Winter Woods.

229
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:02,260
And that's impossible.
Your wings will freeze and...

230
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,929
Chapter 16.

231
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:09,100
Hmm. The Winter Woods.

232
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,387
Hmm.

233
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:57,523
Can't fly.

234
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:02,862
Hurry, now, hurry!
Let's finish up. Stand by with the pulley.

235
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:08,242
All right! It's this season's final pickup,
so let's make it our best.

236
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:13,206
Lucinda, let's leave the loafing
for the Baking Fairies.

237
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:15,666
- Okay, Clanky.
- Right!

238
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,751
Ouch!

239
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,337
Snowflake release system working!

240
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:22,840
Maybe you should
be the test snowflake for a while.

241
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:24,175
- Tink?
- Huh?

242
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,177
We already checked that basket.

243
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:28,304
Right. uh...

244
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,519
Why are you dressed all cozy?

245
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:36,979
I'm going to the Winter Woods.

246
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:38,731
The Winter Woods?

247
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,149
Shh!

248
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:41,776
The Winter Woods?

249
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:42,944
Places, everyone!

250
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,362
The snowy owls. They're here!

251
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,781
Start the pulley!

252
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:47,990
Bye!

253
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,328
Tink! Wait!

254
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:55,414
You can't cross the border, Miss Bell.
Your wings!

255
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:57,333
Don't worry. They're in my coat.

256
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,252
Does this have to do with the...

257
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,630
- The sparkling?
- Yes.

258
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,924
There's somebody in Winter
who can tell me what it means.

259
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,136
Clank! Bobble!
Ls something wrong with that basket?

260
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:09,470
What? Oh!

261
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:14,016
Tink?

262
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,852
I just have to do this.

263
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:20,064
No, no. Everything is fine.

264
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:24,026
We're just sad to see it go.
Pretty basket.

265
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,071
Oh! Honestly. Let it go!

266
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:38,666
That's the new one.

267
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,751
- Uh, new one?
- Mmm-hmm.

268
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:11,782
Excellent work, everyone.
They're off to the cold of winter.

269
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,952
Well, that's that until next year.

270
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,506
Wow. I made it.

271
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:11,842
Welcome back.

272
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:13,761
A Winter Fairy.

273
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,180
- You ready for the drop-off?

274
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,225
Come on. You did it yesterday.
You'll be fine.

275
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,186
All right then. Here we go.

276
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,667
Ah!

277
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:57,972
Look Out!

278
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,439
Sorry about that.

279
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:11,736
Oh, no.

280
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:31,505
Lord Milori.

281
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,052
And what happened here?

282
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,598
A bit of a bumpy landing.
It's only his second drop-off.

283
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,310
As long as the basket made it,
I'd say he did just fine.

284
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:46,270
- How was the crossing?

285
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:48,689
Four bunnies,
two weasels, and a marmot.

286
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:49,857
And they all crossed safely.

287
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,735
Yes. I met up with them
on the north side.

288
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:56,364
The snowflakes
are looking quite beautiful.

289
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:58,366
NO two alike.

290
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:03,829
No, no, no.

291
00:20:03,913 --> 00:20:05,998
Ambitious.

292
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,291
Hmm.

293
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:11,212
Now that is odd.

294
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:12,380
Oh!

295
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,466
It must have been left
in the basket by accident.

296
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,635
Return this to the Keeper.

297
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:18,761
The Keeper.

298
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:23,307
He can send it back
to the Warm Side with his next delivery.

299
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:42,243
It must have come from
the Warm Side. In one of the baskets.

300
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,869
Thanks.

301
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,946
Whoa!

302
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,157
That's the end of that chapter.

303
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,659
Boy, that's a beauty.

304
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:26,620
<i>Flora and Fauna of the Fairies.</i>

305
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:32,126
Put a period there,
then we are pretty much done.

306
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:36,130
Wait. I forgot to number the pages.

307
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:39,633
Oh! I'm going to have to start all over
on this large book.

308
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:41,135
- Keeper. Keeper!
- Yes, what...

309
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,637
The most amazing thing
happened. You'll never believe it.

310
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:45,306
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

311
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,557
I've never felt anything like it!

312
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,643
My friends didn't believe me,
but how could they because it's so...

313
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:52,229
Slow down.
I can only listen so fast.

314
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:54,565
Yesterday,
at the border, my wings.

315
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:57,693
They actually... They lit up.

316
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,070
It's happening again!

317
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:03,908
Oh...

318
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:06,827
Well, I'll be a yeti's uncle.

319
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,722
In all my years.

320
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,898
Your wings. They're sparkling.

321
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:37,983
Like yours.

322
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,487
I've written about the sparkling,

323
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,907
but I've never seen the sparkling
with my own peepers!

324
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,827
Oh, uh, follow me.

325
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:56,126
Now, step the footsies on the snowflake.

326
00:23:15,813 --> 00:23:19,316
Just put your wings into the light.

327
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:38,419
The mainland.

328
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:06,822
Oh, no.

329
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:52,242
Hello?

330
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:53,744
Hello.

331
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:56,246
Hello?

332
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,756
Two fairies born of the same laugh.

333
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:09,009
So that means...

334
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:10,511
You're my...

335
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,388
So we're

336
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,516
sisters.

337
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,853
Yes! And your wings are identical.

338
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,772
That is why they sparkle.

339
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:32,741
Jingles!

340
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,871
Ah... Oh, boy.
Maybe you shouldn't do that.

341
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:42,418
Um, I'm Tinker Bell.

342
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,169
I'm Periwinkle.

343
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,213
So you must have been at the border.

344
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,507
Yeah. I was hoping to see
the animals cross.

345
00:25:48,716 --> 00:25:50,092
I guess I didn't see you.

346
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,594
Me either.

347
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:54,847
What?

348
00:25:57,808 --> 00:26:00,018
I usually just wear them at home.

349
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,564
- Wow.
- Hello.

350
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,733
Keeper, are you in?

351
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,901
Yumping yetis, Lord Milori!

352
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:09,403
If he sees you, he'll send you back.

353
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:11,739
Keeper? Are you here?

354
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:14,158
Don't worry.
I'm going to take care of this.

355
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:15,993
Where are you?

356
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,663
Ah. Come back later!

357
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:20,998
Keeper?

358
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,333
Whoa, boy. Can't get that one back.

359
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:24,960
I need to speak with you.

360
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,587
It's important.

361
00:26:27,755 --> 00:26:29,631
I'll be right back.

362
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,886
I'm right here, Lord Milori.

363
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:35,512
Did you receive that wing book?

364
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,431
You know, once upon a time,

365
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:40,768
you'd stop by just to say hello
and howdy-do.

366
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:43,479
I'm sorry. Hello.

367
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,105
Howdy-dg?

368
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:46,857
Howdy-do.

369
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,070
This book has me worried.
What if a Warm Fairy brought it here?

370
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,909
Well, that might be nice,
then, meeting a Warm Fairy.

371
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,703
Especially one
with such good taste in books.

372
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:01,288
It's too cold.

373
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,540
Maybe if they were wearing a coat,

374
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:05,584
or one of them little sweater vests.

375
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:06,960
- They're nice.
- I'll remind you.

376
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:08,879
Crossing the border is forbidden.

377
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,631
There was a time when it wasn't.

378
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:14,468
The rule is there to keep the fairies safe.
That will never change.

379
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:15,511
But I...

380
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:20,057
If a Warm Fairy comes here,
you will send them back.

381
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:22,684
Of course.

382
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,313
Thank you.

383
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,281
Well, you heard the Lord Milori.

384
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:39,409
He said you must go back home.

385
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:42,454
Of course, he didn't say when.

386
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:46,667
Now, listen, you two,
it gets colder after the dark,

387
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,962
so it's best to get Tinker Bell
home before the first moonlight.

388
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:51,588
Thank you, Dewey.

389
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:52,756
Dewey?

390
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,008
That's his real name.

391
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:57,469
It's what my friends call me.

392
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,472
Thank you.

393
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:01,932
Dewey.

394
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,184
Dewey.

395
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:08,230
So, um, I'm a Frost Fairy. If rost things.

396
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:11,108
- Oh. I'm a Tinker. I...
- Tinker things?

397
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,026
Yep. I even made this coat.

398
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,862
- Oh, I like it.
- Thanks.

399
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:15,988
You're welcome.

400
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,114
Sisters.

401
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:21,535
It's amazing. The dust travels
all the way from the Pixie Dust Tree.

402
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,995
Kind of like you did.

403
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:25,205
...Terence and I
barely escaped the pirate ship!

404
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,291
- Is he your boyfriend?
- Uh...

405
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,668
So Lizzy loves fairies?

406
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:32,087
Yeah. She even built a fairy house.

407
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,381
That's how I met her.
You see, me and Vidia...

408
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:42,180
You collect lost things, too?

409
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:44,099
I call them found things.

410
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:48,478
<i>♪ I never knew
I lost you till I found you.</i>

412

<i>♪ Anymore.</i>

422
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:34,858
This is the Frost Forest.

423
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,652
WOW.

424
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:37,861
That's Gliss.

425
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,824
Come on, Spike. Practice.

426
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:46,286
Okay, okay. Practicing.

427
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,956
And that's Spike. She's a bit...

428
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,040
Whoa!

429
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,215
- Hi.
- Sisters?

430
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,384
Well, I think it's fantastic!

431
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:04,012
Wow, you two look exactly alike!

432
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:07,933
I mean, except for your clothes
and your hair and Peri's a bit more pale.

433
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,977
But your noses are very similar.

434
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,897
Forget their noses.
She's a Warm Fairy. In Winter!

435
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:17,234
You're right.
We got to show her around!

436
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:18,360
Oh, Oh, Oh!

437
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:21,238
Let's take her ice sliding!
Come on, Spike!

438
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:22,781
You are going to love this!

439
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,116
It sounds fun.

440
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:27,160
Yeah. Great idea.
Push the Warm Fairy down a hill of ice.

441
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:30,163
Okay, well, wait for me, you guys.

442
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:35,752
<i>♪ And if you'll be there

Um... I know. Favorite star?

453
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:16,752
Second star

454
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:17,753
to the right.
- To the right.

455
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:21,548
Okay. Favorite drink?

456
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:23,050
Hot chamomile tea.

457
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,634
Iced chamomile tea!

458
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,011
- Oh!

459
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:29,222
Okay, my turn. How about favorite bug?

460
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:32,017
Bug? It's too cold for bugs over here,

461
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,978
but in one of Dewey's books,
I read about butterflies.

462
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,939
Oh, in Butterfly Cove,
there's hundreds of them.

463
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:40,317
It's in Summer. It's right over...

464
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:42,694
Um... Hmm.

465
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:44,905
I guess you can't see it from here.

466
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,241
No. You can't.

467
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:50,577
What's it like over there?

468
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,661
Warm.

469
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:54,039
And the colors? The sounds?

470
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,166
All the animals. And the fish.

471
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:57,667
They swim in melted ice, right?

472
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:58,877
Water.

473
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,838
I wish...

474
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,674
I wish I could go there.

475
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:10,972
- Peri?
- Yeah?

476
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:19,022
I made it warmer over here.
Maybe I could make it colder over there.

477
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:20,607
Are you...

478
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:22,609
Are you saying I could cross?

479
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,529
- Yeah!
- Oh, Tink.

480
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,531
You could show me your world.

481
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,658
I could meet your friends.

482
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,284
Do you think I could see a butterfly?

483
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,120
There's a pretty good chance.

484
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,205
- Oh!

485
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,043
Uh, Tink?

486
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:45,215
- I can't fly!
- Tink!

487
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:48,218
Hold on. Hold on!

488
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,221
I'm slipping!

489
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:58,395
That's it, Fiona. That's it.

490
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,481
Are you girls all right?

491
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,608
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

492
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:07,237
Are you sure? Nothing broken?
Nothing bruised?

493
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:09,823
No. We're okay.

494
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:12,117
This time.

495
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,536
Lord Milori was right.

496
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:18,206
Crossing the border
is just too dangerous.

497
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,375
What are you saying?

498
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,002
I'm sorry, girls,

499
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:26,715
but I'm afraid this isn't going to work out
like you hoped.

500
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:29,259
We have to take Tinker Bell home.

501
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:35,682
Let's go, Fiona.

502
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:52,866
It's...

503
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,784
It's for your own good.

504
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:25,899
I can't watch, Fiona.

505
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:30,570
I promised myself
I wasn't going to do this.

506
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:33,573
Okay. Here's the plan.
Meet me here tomorrow.

507
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,743
Oh, thank goodness. I thought
you were really saying goodbye.

508
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:38,912
No! I just met my sister
I never knew I had

509
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:41,873
and I'm going to say goodbye forever?
Are you kidding?

510
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,166
So...

511
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:48,505
Clank? Bobble?

512
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,008
Guys?

513
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:03,979
Oopsie.

514
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:06,064
Tink! You're back!

515
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:09,693
- Yes.
- Sorry!

516
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:12,112
We thought you were a troll.

517
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:13,196
A troll?

518
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,115
I knew we shouldn't have used
the troll stopper.

519
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:16,741
What if it was a troll?

520
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,576
You'd be saying something different,
wouldn't you?

521
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,120
Guys. It doesn't matter.

522
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:21,538
Oh, right.

523
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:24,874
- I need your help.
- Is it about a glacier?

524
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:28,878
No. But it's kind of a secret.

525
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:30,714
I don't want everybody to know.

526
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,345
I'm pretty sure these buttons will work,
but we're going to need more of them.

527
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:40,265
Aye, unless we use
a couple of acorn caps.

528
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:41,891
Right! Good idea.

529
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,227
Whoo! Now where is that Clanky?

530
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,479
Oh, yes, I'm right here.

531
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:47,564
Oh!

532
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:51,067
I didn't tell everybody.

533
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,697
Just Fawn, Ro, Sil, Dess, and Vidia.

534
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:59,117
So, there's another you.

535
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,077
- Vidia!
- Yeah.

536
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:02,495
I've got a sister.

537
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,456
I told you!

538
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:05,665
Bust my bonnet.

539
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:07,625
- Amazing!
- It's fantastic!

540
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:08,877
I can't believe this is happening.

541
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,003
But how?

542
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,756
They were born of the same laugh!

543
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,759
Tell them, Tink,
what you told me and Bobble.

544
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,428
Her name's Periwinkle.

545
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:22,474
She's a Frost Fairy,
and she's just amazing.

546
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:25,060
I'm making this machine
so she can come here and meet you all,

547
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,479
and after that
we'll go straight to Queen Clarion!

548
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:28,855
Oh...

549
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:31,566
Um, have you thought this through?

550
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:35,236
"Hi, Queen Clarion. Meet the Winter
Fairy I smuggled over the border."

551
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,696
Vidia!

552
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,782
When Queen Clarion
hears how we found each other,

553
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:40,033
and that we're sisters,

554
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:41,951
she will change Lord Milori's rule.

555
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:43,787
Oh, of course she will.

556
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,538
She'd never want you to be apart.

557
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:48,375
It's like you found the perfect lost thing.

558
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,503
And I'm never going to lose her.

559
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,380
Well, then, let's get to work!

560
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:54,881
Just tell us what to do.

561
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:55,924
Great!

562
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:57,717
Okay. We need to place
that wheel right here.

563
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:58,802
Got you, Tink.

564
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:00,762
And let's get that propped up over there.

565
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:02,180
I feel so tinkery.

566
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:03,765
- Clank, Bobble...
- Wait, wait.

567
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:04,891
Finish up the chassis?

568
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:06,184
Exactly.

569
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,936
- Come on, Clanky!
- Bobble!

570
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:12,190
Perhaps you and I are brothers!
It's possible.

571
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:14,317
We look almost exactly alike.

572
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:24,702
Anyone see you?

573
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:25,995
No.

574
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,664
I can't believe we're doing this!

575
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:30,750
So, did you bring it?

576
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,794
Yes.

577
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:35,046
Watch the branch.

578
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:39,050
Careful. More to the right.

579
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:43,388
For the record, we shouldn't be doing
this, whatever it is we're doing.

580
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:47,684
As ordered. One big block of ice.

581
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:50,395
Courtesy of our resident glacier fairy.

582
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,021
Hey.

583
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,565
So, what do you think?

584
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:54,858
It's perfect!

585
00:37:57,527 --> 00:38:00,405
Uh, are you sure
she's not luring you into a trap?

586
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,085
Oh! It's one of those...

587
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:15,962
Things we shouldn't be doing?

588
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:17,839
It's a snowmaker!

589
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:20,884
It makes snow!

590
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:24,762
Yep, this is your ticket
to the warm side of Pixie Hollow.

591
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:26,306
- Wait a second.

592
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:29,184
This is crazy!
You don't even know if this thing works!

593
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,102
Oh, it works, all right.

594
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:33,229
Aye, we made it ourselves.

595
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,733
Of course you did. Just walk away.

596
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,319
How does it work?

597
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:40,487
Guys?

598
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,447
Pull.

599
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,407
Move this around here.

600
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:50,497
You might want to
step aside for this part.

601
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:54,751
Ha! They're serious.

602
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:14,103
Snow!

603
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:15,522
Wow.

604
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,775
You did it! You actually did it!

605
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,280
Ooh! It's cold.

606
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,116
So?

607
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:30,328
Hmm.

608
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:32,038
Go, go on.

609
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:33,790
Live it, man.

610
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:41,464
Whoa!

611
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,177
Welcome, Miss Winkle.

612
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:47,387
Thank you.

613
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,224
All righty! Your tour begins
with the Autumn Forest.

614
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:54,519
Next it's a quick stop
in Springtime Square.

615
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,980
And finally, the Pixie Dust Tree,

616
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,899
which, as you know,
makes all fairy life possible.

617
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:04,070
Aye, that's where you'll be meeting
her majestiness, the queen.

618
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:05,488
The queen?

619
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:07,782
They're going to see the queen!

620
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:09,284
She's very Wise.

621
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,244
And if we tell her we're sisters,

622
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,246
she'll change Lord Milori's rule.

623
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:14,831
That is so exciting!

624
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:17,959
Say hi for me, or curtsy,
or whatever it is you do.

625
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:20,628
- Sure.
- And bring me back an acorn. A big one!

626
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:22,255
- After you.
- Thank you.

627
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:24,882
Bye!

628
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,469
I can't believe
I'm going to get an acorn!

629
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:30,471
Finally! That is so exciting!

630
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,021
WOW.

631
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:47,322
<i>♪ Just when

634
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:01,294

637
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:06,466
Wait for the signal.

638
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:12,555
<i>♪ Wait until you see the wondrous

Surprise!

648
00:41:53,763 --> 00:41:55,390
Oh! Your friends did all this?

649
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:57,183
They wanted to surprise you.

650
00:41:57,517 --> 00:42:01,396
Everyone, this is Periwinkle, my sister.

651
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:02,605
This is so exciting.

652
00:42:02,772 --> 00:42:03,856
- Oh, wow!
- Can you believe it?

653
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:07,860
Hello. It is nice to meet you.

654
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:11,489
I am Rosetta. This is...

655
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:14,534
She's a Winter Fairy.
She's not from the moon.

656
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:17,870
Oh, right. I know, I know.
I'm just so excited!

657
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:19,747
It's great to meet all of you.

658
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:22,625
This is so remarkable!
You two are sisters!

659
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:24,877
Yeah. A little fairy-to-fairy advice.

660
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:28,297
Tink can be tricky
to get along with at times.

661
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:30,174
Yeah. Look who's talking.

662
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:32,343
We can't believe you're over here!

663
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,178
So... Are you cold enough?

664
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,305
Yeah. It's perfect.

665
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:38,599
Oh!

666
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,101
AW!

667
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:42,103
Oh, I nearly forgot.

668
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:47,066
This is for you.
It's called a periwinkle. Also.

669
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:48,651
Thank you.

670
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:52,155
I'll keep it forever.

671
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:57,535
Look at that!

672
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:58,703
It's frost.

673
00:42:58,786 --> 00:43:01,789
She and her friends practice
in the Frost Forest. You should see it!

674
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:04,125
Oh, you should see Tink on ice skates.

675
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:05,918
She's a natural.

676
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:08,045
It's only because you had that lost thing.

677
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:10,923
- Uh, she collects lost things, too?
- Yeah!

678
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:12,425
You guys are so alike.

679
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:13,509
I know.

680
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:16,512
Even our wings are identical.
That's why they sparkled.

681
00:43:16,596 --> 00:43:17,764
- Let's show them.
- I don't feel so...

682
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:19,182
Oh! Periwinkle!

683
00:43:19,265 --> 00:43:20,266
Is she all right?

684
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:22,101
I think she's getting a little too hot.

685
00:43:22,185 --> 00:43:24,854
My wings, I can't feel them.

686
00:43:26,397 --> 00:43:28,191
I think they're too warm.

687
00:43:28,441 --> 00:43:29,859
Oh, the snowmaker!

688
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:32,028
It's running out of ice!

689
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:33,780
We have to get her back to the border!

690
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:35,823
Tink, what about the queen?

691
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:37,200
There's no time.

692
00:43:37,283 --> 00:43:39,911
Clank, grab some ice.
We'll wrap her wings.

693
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:43,956
Be careful. Gentle. Easy.

694
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:46,375
Okay. Let's go. Hurry!

695
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:49,003
All together. All together.

696
00:43:49,086 --> 00:43:50,421
All together.

697
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:51,798
Hurry!

698
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:53,883
We can do this!

699
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:57,637
Hurry!

700
00:43:57,845 --> 00:43:59,347
Go, go, go!

701
00:43:59,764 --> 00:44:01,808
Hold on. We're almost there.

702
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:03,684
Hurry! It's nearly out of ice!

703
00:44:03,768 --> 00:44:05,102
Not much further.

704
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:10,817
Don't worry. We're almost there.

705
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,236
We're going to make it.
We're going to make it!

706
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:16,948
Let me help you.

707
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,537
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

708
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:28,793
Please, can you help her?

709
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:33,172
Tink.

710
00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:46,727
Gently. Lift your wings.
Let the cold surround them.

711
00:45:02,952 --> 00:45:05,872
You're okay. Your wings are okay.

712
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:07,665
Yeah. Yeah.

713
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,626
This is why we do not cross the border.

714
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:16,215
No, it could've worked!
We just needed a bigger piece of ice!

715
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:19,719
And when that was gone?
Your wings could have broken.

716
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:26,225
But they didn't. I'm fine. Thanks to them.

717
00:45:29,312 --> 00:45:32,481
The rule is there to protect you.
I'm sorry.

718
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:35,234
You two may never see
each other again.

719
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:37,653
Oh, please don't do this.
We belong together.

720
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:39,155
We're sisters.

721
00:45:41,407 --> 00:45:43,326
We were born of the same laugh.

722
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:51,542
All the more reason you should want
to keep each other safe.

723
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:53,961
Return home.

724
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:00,843
Come on, Tink. Let's go home.

725
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:02,136
No!

726
00:46:03,888 --> 00:46:07,725
Lord Milori,
your rule will not keep us apart.

727
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:08,893
Tinker Bell.

728
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:13,940
This is not Lord Milori's rule. It's mine.

729
00:46:14,565 --> 00:46:15,942
Queen Clarion?

730
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:17,902
I'm sorry.

731
00:46:25,952 --> 00:46:28,162
You should get deeper into the cold.

732
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:30,456
Back to the north side of the mountain.

733
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:11,640
Speaking of sparkling,
we can conclude

734
00:48:11,724 --> 00:48:17,313
that it spreads in a spiral
and circles the center.

735
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:19,523
Oh!

736
00:48:31,368 --> 00:48:32,620
Hello?

737
00:48:33,662 --> 00:48:34,914
Hello?

738
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:42,671
Peri?

739
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:56,936
Queen Clarion. Why?

740
00:48:58,646 --> 00:48:59,647
Tinker Bell.

741
00:49:00,356 --> 00:49:03,859
Long ago,
when Pixie Hollow was very young,

742
00:49:04,735 --> 00:49:07,196
two fairies met and fell in love.

743
00:49:08,906 --> 00:49:10,658
One of them was a Winter Fairy...

744
00:49:11,325 --> 00:49:14,036
...and the other
was from the warm seasons.

745
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:17,665
The two fairies were enchanted
with each other.

746
00:49:17,748 --> 00:49:20,543
And every sunset,
they met at the border...

747
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:22,753
...where Spring touches Winter.

748
00:49:23,587 --> 00:49:27,758
But as their love grew stronger,
they wished to be together...

749
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:30,386
...and share each other's worlds.

750
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:34,807
So they disregarded the danger
and crossed.

751
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:38,269
One of them broke a wing.

752
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:42,690
For which there is no cure.

753
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:46,068
From that day forward,
Queen Clarion decreed

754
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:48,654
that fairies must never again
cross the border.

755
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:52,283
And I agreed that our two worlds

756
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:55,244
should forever remain apart.

757
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:58,914
And the two fairies?

758
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:01,250
What happened to them?

759
00:50:04,545 --> 00:50:06,672
They had to say goodbye.

760
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:31,071
We saw the snow.

761
00:50:31,155 --> 00:50:32,865
Queen Clarion, something's wrong!

762
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:34,783
The temperature,
it seems to be plummeting!

763
00:50:34,867 --> 00:50:36,619
The hibiscus are halfway to hibernation!

764
00:50:36,702 --> 00:50:38,996
Now, now, ministers, let's not panic.

765
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:40,247
Absolutely right.

766
00:50:40,331 --> 00:50:41,749
Snow!

767
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:44,043
Heave!

768
00:50:44,126 --> 00:50:45,127
Ho!

769
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:47,171
- Heave!
- Ho!

770
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:48,839
Put your muscle into it, Clanky!

771
00:50:48,923 --> 00:50:50,382
I'm trying, Bobble!

772
00:50:51,342 --> 00:50:53,552
What happened? How did this get here?

773
00:50:53,636 --> 00:50:56,764
We don't know, Miss Bell,
but it's stuck real good!

774
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:59,767
Aye, and it's making that thing bigger
by the minute!

775
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:03,646
Guys, down here!

776
00:51:03,729 --> 00:51:04,730
- Come on!
- Got it!

777
00:51:04,813 --> 00:51:05,981
Okay, push!

778
00:51:08,025 --> 00:51:09,985
All together. All together!

779
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:13,530
Upsy-daisy.

780
00:51:15,783 --> 00:51:17,076
We did it!

781
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:18,953
- We did it!

782
00:51:19,036 --> 00:51:20,162
It's over.

783
00:51:20,246 --> 00:51:22,289
Uh, I don't think it is.

784
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,126
Oh, my goodness.

785
00:51:26,669 --> 00:51:28,837
The seasons have
been thrown out of balance.

786
00:51:28,921 --> 00:51:29,964
But if the temperatures

787
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:32,633
continue to drop,
it will freeze all of Pixie Hollow.

788
00:51:35,678 --> 00:51:38,847
- Oh, no.
- Queen Clarion, the Pixie Dust Tree.

789
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:42,935
We must hope
the tree survives the freeze.

790
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:45,854
Otherwise there will
be no more pixie dust.

791
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:49,817
Life in Pixie Hollow will change forever.

792
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,444
And no fairy will ever fly again.

793
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,115
Hurry. We must do everything we can.

794
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,245
Grab as many as you can
and head for the Pixie Dust Tree!

795
00:52:01,412 --> 00:52:05,082
Hurry, guys! This way!
Hop to it! That's it!

796
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,506
Snug as a bug.

797
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:14,633
Oh, no!

798
00:52:22,516 --> 00:52:24,268
Come on, that's it.

799
00:52:25,185 --> 00:52:26,603
Just a little faster.

800
00:52:26,687 --> 00:52:27,938
That's it, fairies.

801
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:31,734
Lay the blankets along the branches,
as many as you can!

802
00:52:32,026 --> 00:52:34,570
We must protect the Pixie Dust Tree!

803
00:52:34,987 --> 00:52:36,989
- Miss Bell!
- Tink! Do you need any help?

804
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:39,158
No! This is my last run!

805
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:41,035
I'll meet you in the tree!

806
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:50,419
Everybody okay?

807
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:55,341
Great. There you go. Nice and toasty.

808
00:52:55,591 --> 00:52:57,634
You guys just stay here and keep warm.

809
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,597
Everything's going to be fine.

810
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,271
It's still alive.

811
00:53:14,651 --> 00:53:15,986
Peri.

812
00:53:17,196 --> 00:53:18,697
Dewey, you've got to see this.

813
00:53:18,781 --> 00:53:20,866
There must be something wrong
with the Pixie Dust Tree.

814
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,034
- Now don't worry...

815
00:53:22,117 --> 00:53:23,535
- Whoa!

816
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:24,620
Careful.

817
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:27,122
I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

818
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:28,248
Oh!

819
00:53:30,584 --> 00:53:31,710
Oh, dear.

820
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:46,266
Okay, you might want to worry
just a little bit.

821
00:53:49,395 --> 00:53:50,437
Tink?

822
00:53:52,356 --> 00:53:53,732
Periwinkle!

823
00:54:12,918 --> 00:54:16,046
Tinker Bell! Are you okay?

824
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:18,257
Why would you fly here?

825
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,425
I had to.

826
00:54:19,508 --> 00:54:21,427
Your jacket. Put on your jacket.

827
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,053
Pixie Hollow's in trouble.

828
00:54:23,137 --> 00:54:25,931
There's a freeze moving in,
and the Pixie Dust Tree is in danger.

829
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:27,850
Oh, that explains it.

830
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:31,270
The pixie dust here,
it already stopped flowing.

831
00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:33,605
I think there's something you can do.

832
00:54:34,022 --> 00:54:36,900
Your frost, it kept the flower alive.

833
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:40,112
Oh! Oh! Oh! Frost does that.
It's like a little blanket.

834
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:42,698
It tucks the warm air inside
and keeps out the cold.

835
00:54:45,868 --> 00:54:48,996
We could frost the Pixie Dust Tree
before the freeze hits it.

836
00:54:49,705 --> 00:54:52,458
Uh, one question.
What about our wings?

837
00:54:52,541 --> 00:54:55,544
If it's a freeze,
it will be cold enough to cross.

838
00:54:56,962 --> 00:54:58,505
Then what are we waiting for?

839
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,555
We're almost to the border!

840
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:14,605
The Autumn Woods.

841
00:55:17,649 --> 00:55:20,319
The freeze.
It's moving so fast.

842
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:22,404
Come on! We have to get to the tree!

843
00:55:38,962 --> 00:55:40,339
That's it, Clanky.

844
00:55:42,257 --> 00:55:44,927
Queen Clarion, it's not working.

845
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,637
The wind, it's too strong!

846
00:55:52,851 --> 00:55:54,061
Tinker Bell.

847
00:55:54,144 --> 00:55:56,355
Queen Clarion! They can help.

848
00:55:56,438 --> 00:56:00,442
Our frost, it covers like a blanket.
It can protect the tree.

849
00:56:06,073 --> 00:56:07,115
Do it.

850
00:56:29,638 --> 00:56:30,639
Oh, no.

851
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:32,057
It's getting colder.

852
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,643
Let's hand out the blankets.
They'll keep us warm!

853
00:56:34,726 --> 00:56:36,728
Hurry, Peri. Hurry!

854
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:50,075
That's it. There you go!
Make sure to cover your wings!

855
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:53,912
The tree! It's too big.
We're never going to make it.

856
00:56:57,332 --> 00:56:58,584
I'm sorry.

857
00:57:20,814 --> 00:57:21,815
Whoopsie! Ha!

858
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:29,072
Lord Milori.

859
00:57:29,156 --> 00:57:30,449
We've come to help.

860
00:57:30,532 --> 00:57:32,075
Now, you didn't think
I was going to let you

861
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,328
do this all by yourself, now did you?

862
00:57:35,954 --> 00:57:37,956
The tree should be our top priority.

863
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,376
But any fairy we can spare
should try to frost the other seasons.

864
00:57:42,669 --> 00:57:45,714
Start at the freeze line
and spread out to Spring and Summer.

865
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:47,633
The rest of you, cover the tree!

866
00:57:55,474 --> 00:57:57,142
Oh, my goodness.

867
00:57:57,225 --> 00:57:59,645
Look, Bobble! The snowy owls!

868
00:57:59,728 --> 00:58:00,729
Ah!

869
00:58:05,317 --> 00:58:06,526
Thank you.

870
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:07,986
Stay warm.

871
00:58:08,612 --> 00:58:09,613
Oh!

872
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:16,036
Now!

873
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:48,026
We've done all we can. Join the others.

874
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:02,624
The freeze is upon us.
You must take cover.

875
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:03,709
Follow me.

876
00:59:06,044 --> 00:59:07,629
Oh, I hope it works.

877
00:59:08,422 --> 00:59:09,423
Tink!

878
00:59:19,808 --> 00:59:21,435
Will everything be all right?

879
00:59:21,518 --> 00:59:24,646
I don't know.
I've never seen anything like this.

880
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:32,487
Thank you, Milori.

881
00:59:32,654 --> 00:59:34,197
Please, take cover.

882
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:45,000
Winter Fairies, stand guard.

883
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,240
What a beautiful sight.

884
01:01:48,081 --> 01:01:51,209
It worked! It worked, Tinker Bell.

885
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:52,919
Oh, thank goodness!

886
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,342
We did it.

887
01:02:08,435 --> 01:02:09,519
Whoa!

888
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:13,773
Oh!

889
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:25,243
Come on, everyone!

890
01:02:28,455 --> 01:02:29,831
Tink! Come on!

891
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,668
Tink?

892
01:02:34,461 --> 01:02:36,630
What's wrong?

893
01:02:45,722 --> 01:02:46,848
Oh!

894
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:53,855
When you flew to Winter,
that's why you fell.

895
01:02:56,691 --> 01:02:57,943
Oh, no.

896
01:02:58,026 --> 01:02:59,444
Oh, Tinker Bell.

897
01:02:59,527 --> 01:03:00,612
Tink.

898
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,865
Why didn't you tell me?

899
01:03:05,116 --> 01:03:06,785
We had to save the tree.

900
01:03:08,036 --> 01:03:11,331
Besides, there's no cure
for a broken wing.

901
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,876
I'm so sorry.

902
01:03:26,888 --> 01:03:29,724
This happened
because we tried to keep you apart.

903
01:03:31,059 --> 01:03:32,394
But never again.

904
01:03:33,228 --> 01:03:34,562
You belong together.

905
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:46,574
It's getting warmer.

906
01:03:47,158 --> 01:03:48,743
You should get back to Winter.

907
01:03:51,204 --> 01:03:52,205
Yeah.

908
01:03:58,253 --> 01:04:01,506
I'll be okay.
I'll meet you tomorrow at the border.

909
01:04:06,428 --> 01:04:07,554
Sisters?

910
01:04:08,513 --> 01:04:09,597
Sisters.

911
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:20,900
Jingles!

912
01:05:02,317 --> 01:05:03,318
Uh... Eh...

913
01:05:03,443 --> 01:05:04,778
That's a new chapter.

914
01:05:09,407 --> 01:05:11,451
Okay, that was amazing.

915
01:05:11,534 --> 01:05:13,578
Miss Bell, you are fantastic!

916
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:20,877
Oh! Queen Clarion!

917
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,005
I didn't know they were going to do
the smoochy, smoochity.

918
01:05:24,089 --> 01:05:25,590
Guess they're telling people now.

919
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:43,858
Next!

920
01:05:47,529 --> 01:05:49,697
Uh, maybe you should go first.

921
01:05:50,698 --> 01:05:52,659
Next.

922
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:54,160
Ugh! All right.

923
01:05:56,538 --> 01:05:58,331
Ooh! Would you look at that.

924
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:00,875
Oh!

925
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,001
Ooh!

926
01:06:02,085 --> 01:06:03,545
That feels good.

927
01:06:13,388 --> 01:06:15,223
Look out! Runaway bunny!

928
01:06:22,063 --> 01:06:23,648
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

929
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,275
Hey, little buddy.

930
01:06:26,568 --> 01:06:28,153
From Dewey?

931
01:06:28,236 --> 01:06:30,488
It's what my friends call me.

932
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:33,366
Wow!

933
01:06:35,577 --> 01:06:37,537
I love your work.
I have so many questions for you.

934
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,747
Okay, you can let go of my hand now.

935
01:06:44,544 --> 01:06:45,753
- Hi.

936
01:06:46,254 --> 01:06:47,338
Hello there.

937
01:06:47,422 --> 01:06:50,216
- I'm Sled.
- Oh, my. That's perfect! Oh!

938
01:06:52,635 --> 01:06:53,970
I'm Rosetta.

939
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,681
Rosetta. That's beautiful.

940
01:06:57,932 --> 01:06:59,893
Oh, my.

941
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:02,937
Oh, Miss Gliss!

942
01:07:03,271 --> 01:07:04,522
An acorn!

943
01:07:04,689 --> 01:07:06,691
Biggest one we could find.

944
01:07:06,774 --> 01:07:07,775
I love it!

945
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:08,943
She likes acorns.

946
01:07:09,027 --> 01:07:10,111
Must be a Winter thing.

947
01:07:10,195 --> 01:07:11,237
Not really.

948
01:07:12,447 --> 01:07:13,448
Tink.

949
01:07:14,949 --> 01:07:16,201
You ready?

950
01:07:16,284 --> 01:07:17,285
Ready.

951
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:29,672
Ooh!

952
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:33,218
