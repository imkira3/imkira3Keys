<i>Engine room, secure the diesels.
Shift propulsion to the battery.</i>

156

Engine room, secure diesels,

Green board, Skipper.
Very well.

Passing the 100-fathom curve.
On course, on time, sir.

160
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:38,193

Very well.

All ahead two-thirds, aye.

162
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:46,432
Mr. Emmett, take her down.
Make her depth 1-5-0 feet,
ten degree down bubble.

163
00:21:46,536 --> 00:21:49,266
One-five-zero feet,

Aye, sir.

164
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:52,603
Chief of the watch,
sound the dive alarm.
Pass the word to 1 MC.

165
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:55,177
Open the main
ballast tank vents.
Aye, sir, passing the word.

166
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:57,678

172
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:45,820
First time

173
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:47,829
That's right.

174
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,066
Six-zero feet.

175
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:57,731
<i>[Dahlgren]
Lower the scope.</i>

176
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:03,445
Captain, engine room reports
minor flooding from shaft seals
and brine pump.

177
00:23:03,546 --> 00:23:07,107
<i>- Bilge is at 18 inches
and rising.
- Very well.</i>

178
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:10,476
<i>How deep does
this thing go?</i>

179
00:23:10,587 --> 00:23:13,522
She'll go all the way
to the bottom
if we don't stop her.

180
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:16,353
Normally we try not to get
below 150 feet.

181
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:18,450
Any deeper, the leaks
overwhelm the pumps.

182
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:21,223
<i>These S-boats are antiques,</i>

183
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:23,231
<i>older than most of the crew.</i>

184
00:23:26,002 --> 00:23:28,596
<i>One-zero-zero feet.
Aye.</i>

185
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:36,077
Excuse me, Mr. Emmett.

186
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:40,148
Put a pipe patch on it,
lash it with marline.

187
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,584
<i>The yard can fix it
when we get back to port.
Aye, sir.</i>

188
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:50,319
Relax, gentlemen.
She's old, but she'll hold.

189
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:55,020
<i>Last night, at 0300 hours,</i>

190
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:58,999
<i>a British destroyer reported
depth charging and sinking
a German U-boat.</i>

191
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:01,502
However,
some time thereafter,

192
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:06,041
Allied direction finding
stations triangulated
a coded enemy radio signal...

193
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:09,339
to this position here,
near the chop line.

194
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:12,244
We believe the U-boat
was disabled, not sunk,

195
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:15,146
and is drifting eastward
on a four-knot current.

196
00:24:15,251 --> 00:24:18,311
<i>Now, French resistance reported
a resupply submarine...</i>

197
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:21,720
sailed from the Lorient U-boat
pens yesterday afternoon,

198
00:24:21,825 --> 00:24:23,725
with engine parts
and mechanics.

199
00:24:23,827 --> 00:24:27,319
We believe
it's gonna rendezvous
with the disabled U-boat.

200
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:31,996
On board that U-boat is this.

201
00:24:35,572 --> 00:24:39,133
- A typewriter?
- An Enigma code machine.

202
00:24:39,242 --> 00:24:42,973
It allows the German navy
to communicate with
its submarines in secret,

203
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:47,175
and our inability
to decipher their messages
is costing us this war.

204
00:24:47,283 --> 00:24:52,152
Mr. Coonan?
All right, this is basically
a Trojan Horse operation.

205
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:57,022
The S-33 will rendezvous
with the U-boat, posing as
the German resupply sub.

206
00:24:57,126 --> 00:25:01,028
I will lead a boarding party
dressed in Kriegsmarine uniforms
to the enemy submarine.

207
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,099
<i>We will take it by force
and secure the Enigma.</i>

208
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,068
Any German survivors
will be transferred to the S-33,
and the U-boat will be scuttled.

209
00:25:08,171 --> 00:25:10,833
The German resupply submarine
will arrive at the rendezvous...

210
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,137
and will assume
that the U-boat succumbed
to its wounds and sank.

211
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:16,542
The Germans must never suspect
we have the Enigma.

212
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:19,444
<i>That is vital.
So it's a race?</i>

213
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:22,211
<i>Yes, effectively.
Who's the boarding party?</i>

214
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:24,582
Well, since you're the X.O.,
you, sir.

215
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:27,747
Mr. Emmett, Mr. Larson,
Mr. Hirsch and nine
of your ship's company.

216
00:25:27,857 --> 00:25:30,883
<i>The captain, of course,
will remain onboard the S-33.</i>

217
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:36,762
Mr. Coonan, our boys
are submarine sailors,
not combat Marines.

218
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:38,834
The boys onboard that U-boat
are sailors too.

219
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:42,871
Your men'll be
ready, Lieutenant.
I'll train them myself.

220
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:45,907
You've come
to the right boat.

Don't be talking about that

We're still bucking
some pretty heavy seas.

I estimate us to be
about three hours
behind schedule.

That's fine, Lieutenant.

You're a first-rate X.O.,

I know you would.
I'm not questioning
your bravery.

264
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:31,758
The question is:
What about their lives?

265
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:37,098
You and Mr. Emmett
are good friends.

266
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,294
You went to the Academy
together.

00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:43,395
Would you be willing
to sacrifice his life?

<i>Or what about
some of the younger
enlisted men?</i>

269
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:49,942
You know,

You willing to lay
their lives on the line?

You see?
You hesitate.

272
00:30:58,287 --> 00:31:01,620
But as a captain, you can't.

273
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:03,783
You have to act.

274
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:06,885
If you don't, you put
the entire crew at risk.

275
00:31:06,996 --> 00:31:11,524
<i>Now that's the job.
It's not a science.</i>

276
00:31:11,634 --> 00:31:16,401
<i>You have to be able to make
hard decisions, based on
imperfect information.</i>

277
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:20,271
<i>Asking men to carry out orders
that may result in their deaths.</i>

<i>And if you're wrong,
you suffer the consequences.</i>

279
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:29,474
If you're not prepared
to make those decisions...

280
00:31:29,585 --> 00:31:34,648
without pause,
without reflection,

281
00:31:34,757 --> 00:31:37,817
then you've got no business
being a submarine captain.

282
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,000
<i>Tell Mr. Hirsch

00:31:50,072 --> 00:31:51,972

you get out of there.

Yeah.

Making slow turns.

She just stopped her screws.

We are not ready.

Can't, sir.

We got a one-way ticket
topside.

If we surface without
a torpedo to fire, we're dead.

Now you've got
to go back in there and try.

Sir, I can't!
You're the only chance
we've got.

Now you're gonna go
back down in that bilge,

and you're gonna do
your job, sailor.

933

Report to me the instant
that torpedo's ready to fire.
Yes, sir.
