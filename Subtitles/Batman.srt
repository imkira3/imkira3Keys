1
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,020
Thank you. Hi. I'd like to go to the Adelphi Hotel.

2
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,610
- Excuse me. - I'm sorry. This is my cab.

3
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,950
I was here first!

4
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,700
Oh, God.

5
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,030
Taxi!

6
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,000
Taxi!

7
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,170
Let's go across. Come on.

8
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,460
We'll get one down the road. Hurry.

9
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,680
For God's sake, Harold, can we please just get a taxi?

10
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,510
I'm trying to get a...Taxi!

11
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,850
We're going the wrong way!

12
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,480
Put that away. We'll look like tourists.

13
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,650
Hi, honey.

14
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,980
We'll never get a cab. Let's cut over to Seventh.

15
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,330
- Seventh is that way. - I know where we are!

16
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,130
Hey, mister. Give me a dollar.

17
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,050
- Come on. - How about it? One dollar.

18
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,220
Are you deaf? You don't speak English?

19
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,230
Come on! Up here.

20
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,560
Hey, lady...

21
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,150
do the kid a favor. Don't scream.

22
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,000
Hey, all right.

23
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,380
American Express card.

24
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
"Don't leave home without it."

25
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,300
Get out of here.

26
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,680
Let's beat it, man. I don't like it up here.

27
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,850
What, are you scared of heights?

28
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,360
I don't know. After what happened to Johnny Gobs...

29
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,940
Look, man, Johnny Gobs got ripped and took a walk off a roof. No big loss.

30
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,820
No, man, that ain't what I heard at all.

31
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,820
I heard that the Bat got him.

32
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,220
The Bat? Give me a break, will you?

33
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,920
Five stories. Straight down. There wasn't no blood in the body.

34
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,630
No shit. It was all over the pavement.

35
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,380
- I'm getting out of here, man. - Shut up, man. Listen to me.

36
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,760
There ain't no Bat.

37
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,390
You shouldn't have turned the gun on that kid.

38
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,920
You want your cut of this money or not? Now shut up! Shut up.

39
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,910
Don't kill me!

40
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,880
Don't kill me! man.

41
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,990
Don't kill me!

42
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,870
I'm not going to kill you. I want you to do me a favor.

43
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,950
I want you to tell all your friends about me.

44
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,240
What are you?

45
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm Batman.

46
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,560
Across this nation...

47
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,650
the words "Gotham City" are synonymous with crime.

48
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,190
Our streets are overrun, our public officials are helpless.

49
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,370
As mayor, I promise to root out the source of this corruption...

50
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,580
Boss Carl Grissom.

51
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,240
Now, our new District Attorney, Harvey Dent...

52
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,940
will carry out that promise.

53
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,260
Harvey

54
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,660
Thank you.

55
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,880
Thank you, Mayor Borg. Thank you.

56
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,050
People of Gotham City...

57
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,060
I'm a man of few words.

58
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,690
But those words will count, and so will my actions.

59
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,230
Police Commissioner Gordon has informed me...

60
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,610
that he has targeted those businesses...

61
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,110
suspected of fronting for the syndicate in this city.

62
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,530
Before the week is out...

63
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,910
we are going to knock down their doors...

64
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,620
and shed the light of the law on that nest of vipers.

65
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,250
Together, we can make this city safe for decent people.

66
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,220
Decent people shouldn't live here.

67
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,050
They'd be happier someplace else.

68
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,930
Pretty tough talk about Carl.

69
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,230
Don't worry about it.

70
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,400
If this clown could touch Grissom, I'd have handed him his lungs by now.

71
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,990
If Grissom knew about us...

72
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,780
he might hand you something.

73
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,240
Don't flatter yourself, angel.

74
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:49,950
He's a tired old man. He can't run this city without me.

75
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,790
And besides...

76
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,800
he doesn't know.

77
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,930
You don't worry about anything, do you, Jack?

78
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,400
You look fine.

79
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,610
I didn't ask.

80
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,660
Yeah. Hanging on.

81
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,800
No. Let me guess.

82
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,800
Giant, menacing, supernatural form. Kind of like a bat.

83
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,560
That's it. What are they seeing up there?

84
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,770
They're drinking Drano.

85
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,350
It's a little weird, Lieutenant.

86
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,940
Thanks for the tip.

87
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,520
Christ. Knox.

88
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,860
Hello, Lt. Eckhardt, I hear we just had us another Bat attack.

89
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,700
That's what, eight sightings now in just under a month?

90
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,120
I hear the Commissioner's even opened a file. True?

91
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,540
Sorry, Knox. These two slipped on a banana peel.

92
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,900
I'm telling you, man, a giant bat!

93
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,120
Keep move.

94
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,750
Don't be writing this stuff in the newspaper, Knox.

95
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,170
It'll ruin your already useless reputation.

96
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,340
Lieutenant, every punk in this town is scared stiff.

97
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,510
Do you know what they say? They say he can't be killed.

98
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,510
They say he drinks blood.

99
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,850
- They say... - I say you're full of shit, Knox.

100
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,150
You can quote me on that.

101
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,440
Is there a 6-foot bat in Gotham City?

102
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,740
And if so, is he on the police payroll?

103
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,030
And if so, what's he pulling down, after taxes?

104
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,020
Brought you a little snack, Eckhardt.

105
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,240
- Why don't you broadcast it? - Shut up and listen.

106
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,320
Harvey Dent has been sniffing around one of our front companies.

107
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,750
That's my territory. If there's a problem, I deal with it.

108
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,080
Your problems are our problems.

109
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,630
I answer to Grissom, not to psychos.

110
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,970
Why, Eckhardt, you ought to think about the future.

111
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,840
You mean when you run the show? You ain't got no future, Jack.

112
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,310
You're an A-1 nut-boy, and Grissom knows it.

113
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,980
Better be sure.

114
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,740
See?

115
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,410
You can make a good decision when you try.

116
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,840
Where you been spending your nights?

117
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,180
I don't care how deeply in debt this festival is, I want a parade.

118
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,670
I want hot dogs, balloons, the whole schemer.

119
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,480
We're gonna celebrate this 200th anniversary proudly and publicly.

120
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,340
We may be celebrating in bankruptcy court.

121
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,230
This festival's $250,000 in the red and we haven't seen one balloon.

122
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,990
You fill this square with people, and the businesses will come back here.

123
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,070
I think a lot of people might stay away, Mayor. They're scared.

124
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,280
They won't be scared when you get Grissom in that courthouse.

125
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,790
I promised that, remember?

126
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,260
Welcome, Count Dracula.

127
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,880
- Had any sightings of Bigfoot lately? - Hey, Knox...

128
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,760
- they buried your story on the Batman. - That's what they do to garbage.

129
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,880
This is Pulitzer Prize stuff, guys.

130
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,340
Hey, Knox. I got something for you.

131
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,240
Very funny. You should have a little bit more gore under the fangs, though.

132
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,690
What a dick.

133
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,770
Hello, legs.

134
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,070
I'm reading your stuff.

135
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,160
Well, I'm reading yours.

136
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,490
Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.

137
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,740
Yeah, photographer. Vogue, Cosmo. Yeah.

138
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,500
Listen, if you want me to pose nude, you're gonna need a long lens.

139
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,960
Actually, I was in the Corto Maltese.

140
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,170
A girl could get hurt doing this stuff.

141
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,340
So, what brings you here?

142
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,680
I'm here to see some of the wildlife in Gotham City.

143
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,300
Wildlife? Like what?

144
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,100
Like...bats.

145
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,520
- Who sent you? - Nobody, really.

146
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,770
I just loved your story, and...

147
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
I like bats.

148
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,120
really?

149
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,870
My pictures, your words. Pulitzer Prize material. Just think.

150
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,660
Okay, you're a visionary. You're also the only one who believes me.

151
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,450
I need something tangible.

152
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,170
Gordon's got a file on this. I can't even get him on the phone.

153
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,540
Bruce Wayne's benefit. He'll be there, right?

154
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:33,190
Yeah. I don't seem to be on the guest list. No.

155
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,050
Yes. Yes.

156
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,780
Yes. Vale, will you marry me?

157
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,120
- No. - Will you buy me lunch?

158
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,430
- Maybe. - I eat light.

159
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,070
Say this...

160
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,400
son of a bitch...

161
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,180
makes a connection with us and with Axis Chemicals.

162
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,440
What kind of damage are we looking at?

163
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,410
If he ties us in with Axis Chemicals, we're dead and buried.

164
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,870
We should move immediately.

165
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,750
I say we break into the place...

166
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,750
trash the office...

167
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,590
and make off with the records and say it was industrial espionage.

168
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,260
Smart thinking. That's the way to go. In fact...

169
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,850
I'd like you to handle this operation personally.

170
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,940
Me?

171
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,820
Hello, sweetheart.

172
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,780
I wonder if you'd mind waiting in the next room?

173
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,090
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.That's all.

174
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,640
Carl...

175
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,230
can we get somebody else to do this?

176
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,440
The fumes in that place...

177
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,940
Jack.

178
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,110
It's an important job.

179
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,990
I need someone I can trust.

180
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,160
You are my number one guy.

181
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,000
Now...

182
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,000
don't forget...

183
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,170
your lucky deck.

184
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,190
My friend...

185
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,730
your luck is about to change.

186
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,150
Police Department.

187
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,870
Get me Lt. Eckhardt.

188
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,170
Can I help you, sir?

189
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,370
Thanks. Thank you very much. That's very nice of you.

190
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,370
Here you go.

191
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,470
- Good evening, ma'am. - A little crowded.

192
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,350
Excuse me.Excuse me...

193
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,530
Could you tell me which of these guys is Bruce Wayne?

194
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,570
I'm not sure.

195
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,490
Thanks anyway.

196
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,060
Yeah

197
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,160
Thank you.

198
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,490
Oh, certainly.

199
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,540
Bet!

200
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,360
Eight. I can make that eight.

201
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,280
- I can make that eight. - Place your bets, please.

202
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,610
Commissioner! Mrs. Gordon, you look lovely.

203
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,620
How about that rumor that Commissioner's got a file on the Batman?

204
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,780
That's not true, is it?

205
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,790
Knox, for the ninth time, there is no Bat.

206
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,950
If there were, we would find and arrest him.

207
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,660
Would you confirm him? Be straight with me, Commissioner.

208
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,500
- How you making out? - Not good at all.

209
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,540
Mr. Dent, I love that tie.

210
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,510
We were discussing the pros and cons of winged vigilantes. What's your stand?

211
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,090
Mr. Knox, we have enough problems in this city...

212
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,890
without worrying about ghosts and goblins.

213
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,700
Pardon me, but that's not a denial.

214
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,440
Excuse me, dear. I'll be back.

215
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,440
Isn't anybody going to go on record?

216
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,480
- Your Honor, great suit. - No comment.

217
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,320
- Robert, what's up? - Anonymous tip.

218
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,200
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

219
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,790
Why wasn't I told about this? Who's in charge?

220
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,970
- Eckhardt, sir. - Oh, my God!

221
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Come on, let's go.

222
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,340
Commissioner Gordon?

223
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,560
Commissioner Gordon?

224
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:27,320
Wait, wait. Living room, dining room, arsenal.

225
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,490
Look at this stuff.

226
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,830
Who is this guy?

227
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,830
He gives to all these humanitarian causes, and then collects all this stuff.

228
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,250
He probably does it to get chicks. They like him for his big charity balls.

229
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,340
Don't leave out his very large bankroll.

230
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,130
Now, remember, the more they've got, the less they're worth.

231
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,640
Then this guy must be the most worthless guy in America.

232
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,620
Check this out. He must have been King of the Wicker People.

233
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,530
Where'd this come from?

234
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,940
I have no idea.

235
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,900
It's Japanese.

236
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,650
How do you know?

237
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,610
Because I bought it in Japan.

238
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,800
- Who are you? - Sorry. Bruce Wayne.

239
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,570
Alexander Knox.

240
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,830
I read your work. I like it a lot.

241
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,870
Thanks. Can I have a grant?

242
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,210
- Vicki Vale. - Hi.

243
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,670
- Bruce Wayne. - Are you sure?

244
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,550
Yeah, this time.

245
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,500
I've seen your photographs from Corto Maltese, haven't I?

246
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,550
Right.

247
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,390
You've got a wonderful eye.

248
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,520
Some people think she has two.

249
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,150
This is an amazing house. I'd like to shoot it sometime if you...

250
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,770
We need to open a few more cases of the champagne. Will that be all right?

251
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,570
Sure. Go ahead.

252
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,740
Open, what, six? Six?

253
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,510
- Six is good. - Okay.

254
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,280
That's great, six, thanks.

255
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,950
Anyway, you gonna be staying in Gotham for a while?

256
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,960
I'd love to. I'm intrigued by Alex's giant bat stories.

257
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,880
Oh, right. The Batman.

258
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,090
That's a little bit light after the war in Corto Maltese, isn't it?

259
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,430
- What do you do for a living? - Well, I'm involved...

260
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:18,010
Sir, Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave.

261
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,270
Okay, thank you.

262
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,690
Very unexpectedly, sir.

263
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,060
Will you two excuse me?

264
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,450
I think perhaps this way, sir.

265
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,530
Yeah

266
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,070
Alfred, they need some more wine in the front room...

267
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,200
and someone named Mrs. Daley needs a copy of the menu.

268
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,990
And give Knox a grant.

269
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,420
Nice talking with you, Wayne.

270
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,150
The rich...

271
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,480
You know why they're so odd? Because they can afford to be.

272
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,130
Look at this mirror.

273
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,260
Maybe it should be Bruce Vain.

274
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,800
- Robert, what's up? - Anonymous tip.

275
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,340
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

276
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,680
If we could put our hands on him, we'd have Grissom.

277
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,270
Why wasn't I told about this? Who's in charge?

278
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,980
- Eckhardt, sir. - Oh, my God!

279
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,770
Come on, let's go.

280
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,440
All right. Take a good look. This is the guy.

281
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,000
All right, get a good look.

282
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,630
Shoot to kill. You know what I mean?

283
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,880
All right, let's move out.

284
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,900
We've been ratted out here, boys.

285
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,710
Watch it.

286
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,220
Freeze!

287
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,610
You, left. You take the right. Move it.

288
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,470
What the hell's going on?

289
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,160
What are you trying to do? Blow the collar?

290
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,950
I'm in charge here, not Carl Grissom.

291
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,870
This is Commissioner Gordon. I want him taken alive.

292
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:35,680
I repeat. Any man who opens fire on Jack Napier will answer to me.

293
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,640
Let me down!

294
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,760
Let me down!

295
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,860
Let me down!

296
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,900
Oh, my God!

297
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,820
He went that way!

298
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,430
See if you can get up on the catwalk on that side.

299
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,300
You take that side. Be careful. Be very careful.

300
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,320
Jesus!

301
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,450
Let him go, or I'll do Gordon!

302
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,640
Nice outfit.

303
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,810
Come on, Jack, let's go!

304
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,990
Come on! Jack!

305
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,280
Eckhardt!

306
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,290
Think about the future.

307
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,750
God damn it, we had him.

308
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,580
Hold it right there!

309
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,720
- Who is this guy? - I don't know.

310
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,850
Until we find out, keep a lid on it.

311
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:30,340
Wait. If there's no Bat, then who dropped this guy, Napier, into the acid?

312
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,550
Suicide? Wait, I want to get this on tape.

313
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,260
Hello?

314
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,810
He hung up. What have you got?

315
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,310
Here's the inner city, there's Axis Chemicals...

316
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,690
and here's the sightings so far.

317
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,440
Maybe Batman has some kind of flight pattern or something.

318
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,610
That's all I can think of.

319
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,400
This is very good. I'll tell you what...

320
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,400
tonight, first I'll take you to dinner, then we'll walk the trail.

321
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,030
No can do. I got a date. With Bruce Wayne.

322
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,520
Wayne! Wayne! Oh, no!

323
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,880
How about you?

324
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,620
The guy's a stiff. He's a rich stiff, but you could do much better.

325
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,790
Thanks for being so concerned. Bye.

326
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,970
How's the soup?

327
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,970
Excuse me?

328
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,980
The soup. How is it?

329
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,440
It's great.

330
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,700
Could you pass the salt?

331
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,820
Sure.

332
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,120
Thanks.

333
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,340
Did you have a hard time finding the house?

334
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,810
- No, it was no problem. - Good.

335
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,730
Do you like eating in here?

336
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,650
Yeah.

337
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:19,740
You want to know the truth, I don't think I've ever been in this room before.

338
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,290
Do you want to get out of here?

339
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,500
Yes.

340
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,880
There was young Master Bruce...

341
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,930
leading his gray pony with me on its back...

342
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,720
like a sack of old potatoes, covered in mud and nursing a sprained ankle.

343
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,770
That was the first and last time I gave him a riding lesson.

344
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,190
I think I've embarrassed him for long enough.

345
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,570
I'm off to bed.

346
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,660
Please, leave everything. I'll tidy up in the morning.

347
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,820
- Good night, miss. - Good night, Alfred.

348
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,120
- Good night, sir. - Good night, Alfred.

349
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,960
He's really wonderful. He loves you a lot.

350
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,590
Alfred's great. I couldn't find my socks without him.

351
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,010
He sort of reminds me of my grandfather.

352
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,470
Were you close to him?

353
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,680
Yeah, I used to spend summers with him and my grandmother.

354
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,980
They had a house on the lake. Nothing like this, but...

355
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,610
it was fun.

356
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,610
- That sounds nice. - Yeah.

357
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,400
What about your family?

358
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,240
Actually, Alfred is my family.

359
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,040
This house and all this stuff really doesn't seem like you at all.

360
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,170
Some of it is very much me.

361
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,510
Some of it isn't.

362
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,720
That dining room is definitely not you.

363
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,680
The dining room isn't.

364
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,580
- Let's see how we did. - Yeah.

365
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,060
Oh, my God!

366
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,730
Mirror.

367
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,940
Mirror!

368
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:12,460
You understand that the nerves were completely severed.

369
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,420
You see what I have to work with here.

370
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,570
There's an awful lot of stairs in this place.

371
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,660
My feet are killing me.

372
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,740
Okay.

373
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,380
I feel a little drunk. And you're not anything.

374
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,300
One drink and I'm flying.

375
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,420
Why are you afraid of flying?

376
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,750
That you, sugar bumps?

377
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,130
Who the hell are you?

378
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,460
It's me.

379
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,760
"Sugar bumps."

380
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,220
Jack.

381
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,640
Thank God, you're alive! I heard you'd been...

382
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,850
Fried?

383
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,180
Is that what you heard?

384
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,770
You set me up over a woman.

385
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,480
A woman!

386
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,320
You must be insane.

387
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,170
Don't bother.

388
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,880
Your life won't be worth spit!

389
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,630
I've been dead once already.

390
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,880
It's very liberating.

391
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,260
You should think of it as therapy.

392
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,140
Jack, listen.

393
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,810
Maybe we can cut a deal.

394
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,230
Jack?

395
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,490
Jack is dead, my friend.

396
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,030
You can call me...

397
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,530
Joker.

398
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,450
And as you can see...

399
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,370
I'm a lot happier.

400
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,940
What a day.

401
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,250
Gotham City.

402
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,500
It always brings a smile to my face.

403
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,090
"Winged freak...

404
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,180
"terrorizes..."

405
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,100
Wait till they get a load of me.

406
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,700
I've got an idea. How about lunch at my place?

407
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,120
I'll show you some photos.

408
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,750
Sure. Okay.

409
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,290
Wait a minute. No, I can't. I can't make it.

410
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,420
Okay, we'll do it later in the day.

411
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,840
Hold on a second.

412
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,890
I can't make it then, either. I've got a very important meeting today.

413
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,890
What's wrong?

414
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,220
Nothing's wrong.

415
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,420
Really. I've just got to go out of town on business for a few days.

416
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:27,940
- Okay, we'll do it when you get back. - All right.

417
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,150
I got to go. I'm late.

418
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,860
Bye.

419
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,870
Jesus.

420
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,970
Alfred.

421
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,630
- It's nice to see you again, ma'am. - Nice to see you, too.

422
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,050
I'll talk to you guys when you get back.

423
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,470
Back, Miss Vale? We're going to be here for quite a while.

424
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,720
Well, bye.

425
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,930
Honey...

426
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,890
you'll never believe what happened to me today.

427
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:33,480
So, gentlemen, that's how it is. Until Grissom resurfaces...

428
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,310
I'm the acting president.

429
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:39,110
And I say, starting with this anniversary festival...

430
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,400
we run this city into the ground.

431
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,650
Why don't we hear this from Grissom?

432
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,420
Yeah.

433
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,510
And what's with that stupid grin?

434
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,180
Life's been good to me.

435
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,930
What if we say "no"?

436
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,810
Well, Tony...

437
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,280
nobody wants a war.

438
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:10,430
If we can't do business, we'll just shake hands and that'll be it.

439
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,810
Yeah?

440
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,160
Yeah

441
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,210
I got a live one here.

442
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:35,760
There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight

443
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,580
Antoine got a little hot under the collar.

444
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,290
You're crazy.

445
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:05,370
Haven't you ever heard of the healing power of laughter?

446
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:15,500
- Now get out of here! - You heard him. Let's go! Move it!

447
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,390
You think it over.

448
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:22,980
Let's go, come on. Get out of here.

449
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,650
Move it!

450
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,730
Bob

451
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,770
I want you to go down to the Globe, follow that reporter Knox.

452
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,190
Take your camera.

453
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:43,750
See what he knows about this Batman.

454
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,420
And, Bob...

455
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,340
remember, you...

456
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,430
are my number one guy.

457
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:01,060
Yes, sir.

458
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,660
Your pals...

459
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,200
they're not bad people.

460
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:23,010
Maybe we...

461
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:27,090
ought to give them a couple of days to think it over.

462
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,480
No?

463
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,910
Grease them now?

464
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,120
Okay.

465
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,390
You are a vicious bastard, Rotelli.

466
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,920
I'm glad you're dead.

467
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:59,220
I'm glad you're dead.

468
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,850
I'm glad he's dead.

469
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:13,260
I need that.

470
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,520
I'm losing confidence in you. I thought we were a team.

471
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,140
This wouldn't be a personal issue for you, would it?

472
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,810
I just want you to do your job.

473
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,150
I am doing my job.

474
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,470
Me, too. I'm protecting my partner.

475
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:30,320
There's nothing in these files. No photos, no histories, no nothing. Who is this guy?

476
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,460
Who cares?

477
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:37,590
Forget about Bruce Wayne. I'm on to Batman.

478
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,880
They should be out here any second.

479
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,440
I can't wait to hear the explanation for this one.

480
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,950
Here he comes, man.

481
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,600
What is this affidavit you filed?

482
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,670
Grissom gave you all his businesses?

483
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:47,820
Mr. Grissom asked me, as a personal favor...

484
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,460
to take over the operation of his businesses until he returns.

485
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,070
That's a pretty big favor. You two must have been very close.

486
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,160
Very close.

487
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,510
Did you do a little time together as children?

488
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:46,180
Our accountants are looking into it. We assure you, the affidavit is legitimate.

489
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,850
I smell fresh ink, guys. You can prove all this?

490
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,170
What am I asking? Of course you can.

491
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,650
We have witnesses. Grissom's signature is perfectly legitimate.

492
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,670
It is legitimate.

493
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,520
I saw it. I was there.

494
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,450
I saw it all.

495
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:09,150
He reached up with his dead hand...

496
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,820
and signed it in his own blood.

497
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,390
And he did it...with this pen.

498
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:19,400
Hello, Vinnie. It's your uncle Bingo.

499
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:22,680
Time to pay the check.

500
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,230
The pen...

501
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,940
is truly mightier than the sword.

502
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,790
Get down!

503
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:12,960
Doesn't this gang war dampen the city's plans for the 200th anniversary festival?

504
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:16,750
The festival opens. The police are gonna stop these gangsters.

505
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,040
Mr. Dent, what do you think about the theory...

506
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,300
that the mysterious Batman is a mob enforcer killing these men?

507
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:25,660
I don't have any comment.

508
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:32,400
Batman.

509
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,040
Batman.

510
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,650
Can somebody tell me what kind of a world we live in...

511
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,310
where a man dressed up as a bat...

512
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,550
gets all of my press?

513
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:50,050
This town needs an enema!

514
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,250
Alfred.

515
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,610
May I have a glass of water?

516
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,090
I'm relieved that you're home, sir.

517
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:07,390
Miss Vale telephoned. She was rather concerned.

518
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,340
I feel that there's a certain weight that lifts when she is here.

519
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,790
Alfred...

520
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,210
why don't you marry her?

521
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:20,040
That's not exactly what I had in mind, sir.

522
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,240
No.

523
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,430
I can't go on with that right now.

524
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:30,720
If not now...

525
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,560
when?

526
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,560
I don't know.

527
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,570
I just found out Jack Napier's still alive.

528
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:52,950
He's running Grissom's men. I need all the information the police have on him.

529
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,540
- Yes, sir. - Thank you.

530
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,210
Alfred.

531
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,690
She is great, isn't she?

532
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,010
Yes, sir.

533
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,200
- City room, Knox. - Hi.

534
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,040
- I want you to check something out for me. - Sure.

535
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,140
Find out what's so special about the alley at Pearl and Phillips Streets.

536
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,060
- Pearl and Phillips? - Yeah.

537
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,060
You got it.

538
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:31,880
Okay.

539
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,220
Okay, bye.

540
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,130
Mr. Wayne.

541
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:09,590
So much to do and so little time.

542
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,740
The photos.

543
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,230
Who's that loss?

544
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,390
It's Knox.

545
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:19,370
Bad tie. No style.

546
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,780
Stop the press!

547
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,430
- Who is that? - That's Vicki Vale.

548
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,320
She's the photographer who's working with Knox.

549
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:30,170
That girl has style.

550
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,040
Jesus marimba!

551
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,030
A lovely beast like that running around...

552
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,070
could put steam in a man's strides.

553
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,080
She's dating some guy named Wayne.

554
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:43,640
She's about to trade up.

555
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,230
It's hard to stay inside the lines.

556
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:52,950
I'm about...

557
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,870
to get a new girl, Bobby.

558
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,000
I'm of a mind to make some mooky.

559
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:04,250
- Phone book. - Yes, sir.

560
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,550
So much to do...

561
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,220
and so little time.

562
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:39,310
Have you shipped a million of those things?

563
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,560
Yes, sir.

564
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,500
Ship them all! We're going to take them out a whole new door!

565
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,130
Ten seconds to transmission.

566
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,470
Five, four...

567
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:59,040
three, two, one.

568
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:01,260
Cue music.

569
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:05,430
Cue Becky.

570
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:10,900
Good evening. The fashion world was stunned today...

571
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,890
by the sudden deaths of models Candy Walker and Amanda Keeler.

572
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,130
Cause of death has been attributed to a violent allergic reaction...

573
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:24,350
although authorities have not ruled out the possibility of drug use.

574
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,150
Peter.

575
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:29,030
And plans continue for the city's 200th birthday...

576
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:32,460
as Mayor Borg announced today at the unveiling...

577
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,630
This just in.

578
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:38,470
Three mysterious deaths at a beauty parlor...

579
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:46,160
At a beauty parlor in Gotham were discovered today.

580
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:48,870
What the hell's going on?

581
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:51,940
Becky, this is hardly the...

582
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,310
Becky.

583
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,170
Kill the camera.

584
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:59,040
This is Rene on the news floor.

585
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:01,870
I need some paramedics up here now.

586
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,530
New and improved Joker products!

587
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,830
With a new secret ingredient.

588
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,410
Smylex!

589
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,030
What is this?

590
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,840
Now, let's go over...

591
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,620
to our blind taste test.

592
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,540
Love that Joker.

593
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,470
- Where's it coming from? - I don't know.

594
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:31,940
He don't look happy. He's been using brand X.

595
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,420
But with new and improved Joker brand...

596
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:38,640
I get a grin again...

597
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,700
and again.

598
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,980
That luscious tan...

599
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:45,150
those ruby lips...

600
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:51,430
and hair color so natural, only your undertaker knows for sure.

601
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,610
I know what you're saying:

602
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:57,120
"Where can I get these fine, new items? "

603
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:02,500
That's the gag. Chances are, you bought them already!

604
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,430
Love that Joker.

605
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,250
So, remember...

606
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:09,890
put on a happy face.

607
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:17,440
- The information you requested. - Thank you.

608
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:27,770
"Jack Napier, assault with a deadly weapon, age 15.

609
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,220
"Results of psychological profile...

610
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:35,530
"violent mood swings, highly intelligent, emotionally unstable.

611
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,300
"Aptitudes include science, chemistry, and art."

612
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,880
Chemistry.

613
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:52,270
- Alfred, let's go shopping. - Yes, sir.

614
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:06,050
Six new deaths, with no clues as to the Joker's deadly weapon.

615
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,520
And what is the pattern?

616
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,170
Foods, alcohol, or beauty and hygiene products?

617
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,180
Cologne, mouthwash, underarm deodorant?

618
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:20,170
Or worse yet, there may be no pattern.

619
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,510
The search goes on through Gotham's shopping nightmare.

620
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:29,710
We are going to have a festival if I have to get a shotgun to get people there myself.

621
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,500
Do you hear the words coming out of my mouth? The festival is on!

622
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:37,260
And you find out what this madman is poisoning us with.

623
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,390
And fast. Do you read me?

624
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:43,990
We're working on it. I need all the help I can get.

625
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,850
Bruce, hi. It's Vicki.

626
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,730
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna be 10 minutes late to the museum.

627
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,580
I'll see you when I get there. Bye.

628
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,580
Sir, a message from Miss Vale.

629
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,850
She'll be 10 minutes late in meeting you at the museum.

630
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,080
Okay, fine, thank you. Wait a minute, Alfred.

631
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,470
I'm not meeting her today.

632
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:26,650
Jack, where are you going?

633
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:31,410
Daddy's going to make some art, darling.

634
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:07,850
Excuse me. Mr. Wayne's table?

635
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,410
Yes. He hasn't arrived yet.

636
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:12,950
We have a table waiting.

637
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,050
All right.

638
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:41,730
Miss Vale, this just arrived for you.

639
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,430
Gentlemen!

640
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:48,860
Let's broaden our minds. Lawrence.

641
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,640
Give him a shave.

642
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,930
Terence, brush.

643
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,490
The one-dollar bill.

644
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,850
Hold it!

645
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:19,660
I kind of like this one, Bob. Leave it.

646
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,760
You can take that off now, I think.

647
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:42,340
You're beautiful in an old-fashioned kind of way.

648
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:46,560
But I'm sure we can make you more today.

649
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:51,940
Is that your portfolio?

650
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:56,030
I'm meeting someone who wants to see my work.

651
01:03:58,310 --> 01:03:59,320
Crap.

652
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:00,330
Crap.

653
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:01,980
Crap.

654
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,300
Crap.

655
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,500
Crap...

656
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,210
Now that's good work.

657
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:16,120
The skulls, the bodies.

658
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:21,180
You give it such a glow. I don't know if it's art, but I like it.

659
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:24,670
Let me tell you what I'm thinking about, sweetie.

660
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,720
I was in the bath one day...

661
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,720
when I realized why I was destined for greatness.

662
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:34,680
You know how concerned people are about appearances.

663
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:37,560
This is attractive, that is not.

664
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:42,310
That is all behind me. I now do what other people only dream.

665
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:45,570
I make art. Until someone dies.

666
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,290
See?

667
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:52,920
I am the world's first fully-functioning homicidal artist.

668
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,970
What do you want?

669
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:00,430
My face on the one-dollar bill.

670
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,390
You must be joking.

671
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,820
Do I look like I'm joking?

672
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:08,840
Well...

673
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,800
Listen.

674
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:15,680
We mustn't compare ourselves to regular people. We're artists.

675
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:19,020
For instance, let me challenge you with a little piece I did.

676
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:21,810
Bob. Alicia.

677
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:24,560
You will take pictures and record my work.

678
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:29,320
You will join me in the avant-garde of the new aesthetic.

679
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:33,270
Jack, you said I could watch you improve the paintings.

680
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:37,210
I'm in trouble now.

681
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:39,930
Why is she wearing a mask?

682
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,330
She's just a sketch, really.

683
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:46,000
Alicia, sit down. Show the lady why you wear the mask.

684
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:50,460
You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's been made over in line with my new philosophy.

685
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:52,090
So now, like me...

686
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:55,030
she is a living work of art.

687
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:02,580
I'm no Picasso, but do you like it?

688
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,190
It's great.

689
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:08,400
So, what can I do for you?

690
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:11,190
A little song, a little dance.

691
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,910
Batman's head on a lance.

692
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:16,820
Tell me, what do you know about...

693
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:20,080
I don't know anything about Batman.

694
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:21,960
Really?

695
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,310
Well, how about a little "you and me"?

696
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:28,630
You're insane.

697
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:30,840
I thought I was a Pisces. Come on.

698
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:33,880
Let's make up. Have a little...

699
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:36,280
whiff of my posy.

700
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,530
Help me!

701
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:45,980
I'm melting!

702
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:50,040
I'm melting! Help me! I'm melting!

703
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:58,260
Boo.

704
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:14,520
Hold on.

705
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:26,660
Where does he get those wonderful toys?

706
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:32,210
- Get in the car. - Which one?

707
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,250
Let's go.

708
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,600
Shields.

709
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,160
How much do you weigh?

710
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:43,340
About 108, I think.

711
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:53,600
Hold on.

712
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:05,970
See that thing on my belt? Grab it.

713
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,570
Whatever you do, don't let go.

714
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:23,450
No blood.

715
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:25,310
Who is this guy?

716
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:27,130
Check his wallet.

717
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,500
- Wait a minute. - What is that?

718
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:34,680
Some kind of body armor. He's human after all.

719
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:37,180
Take off the mask.

720
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:43,770
Shoot her!

721
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,170
Shields open.

722
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:14,680
You weigh a little more than 108.

723
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:17,700
- Really? - Let's go.

724
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,830
Stop.

725
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,940
Where are we going?

726
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:14,280
Be careful.

727
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,240
Bats.

728
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:27,660
They're great survivors.

729
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:55,680
- What is all this? - The police have got it wrong.

730
01:14:55,710 --> 01:14:58,140
They're looking for one product.

731
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:01,910
The Joker's tainted hundreds of chemicals at the source.

732
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,230
Then whole shipments of products would be poisoned.

733
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:09,150
And we'd all be dead.

734
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:10,900
No.

735
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:15,200
The poison only works when components are mixed. Hairspray won't do it alone.

736
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:21,280
But hairspray mixed with lipstick and perfume will be toxic, and untraceable.

737
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:24,050
How did you figure this out?

738
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:31,600
Take that to the press.

739
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,810
I might have some trouble with that.

740
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:39,030
A lot of people think you're as dangerous as the Joker.

741
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,950
He's psychotic.

742
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:45,870
Some people say the same thing about you.

743
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:47,990
What people?

744
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,540
Well, I mean, let's face it.

745
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:55,880
You're not exactly normal. Are you?

746
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:58,490
It's not exactly a normal world, is it?

747
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,410
Why did you bring me here?

748
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:04,390
You could have sent that stuff to the press yourself.

749
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:06,390
You're right.

750
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
There is something else you have that I want.

751
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:11,680
What?

752
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:36,900
He took the film.

753
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,870
Yeah.

754
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:44,450
Where have you been? Are you all right? Do you want me to come on over?

755
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,010
No, Allie.

756
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:52,250
If I bring something to you, can we make the evening edition?

757
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,520
Just barely. Is it hot?

758
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,130
Yeah, it's real hot.

759
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,940
Yeah, bye.

760
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:01,610
- Copy! - Yes, sir?

761
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,980
Avoid the following combinations:

762
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:19,090
Deodorants with baby powder, hairspray, and lipstick.

763
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:23,660
Safe products are flying in as Gotham City goes on a forced fast.

764
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:27,040
And all of Gotham is wondering what to make of Batman.

765
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:29,760
Friend or foe?

766
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:33,270
I have given a name to my pain...

767
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:36,440
and it is Batman.

768
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:44,570
You must possess strength to inflict pain, Bob.

769
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:47,350
We've got a flying mouse to kill...

770
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:50,620
and I want to clean my claws.

771
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,900
Sir, Miss Vale called again.

772
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,400
Dare I suggest that your present course of action...

773
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:03,500
might simply strengthen her resolve?

774
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:06,300
She is quite tenacious.

775
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,410
You're right about that.

776
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:14,660
And if I may say so, quite special. Perhaps you could try telling her the truth.

777
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:25,490
Coming.

778
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,280
Hi.

779
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,790
May I come in?

780
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,510
This is a nice apartment.

781
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,060
Lots of space.

782
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,130
Listen, I came over to...

783
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:06,220
- clear a few things... - I don't know who you think you are!

784
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:08,100
- You hurt me. - I know.

785
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:12,930
I called you and I called you. And you lied! You lied about leaving town.

786
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,270
- Let me tell you why. - Let me tell you!

787
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,020
You invited me out, we went to dinner.

788
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:19,160
I thought we felt something. And I trusted you.

789
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,230
I even slept with you. I can't believe I did that.

790
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:25,780
Then you wouldn't return my calls. You must be some kind of jerk.

791
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:31,060
You're a real nice girl and I like you a lot, but right now, shut up.

792
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,970
I have something I have to tell you.

793
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:46,110
You know how people have different sides to their personality?

794
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,400
Sometimes...

795
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:54,350
a person will have to actually lead a different life.

796
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:56,690
Oh, my God, you're married.

797
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,120
No, I'm not married.

798
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:07,460
You see...

799
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:11,170
my life is really...

800
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:15,640
complex.

801
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:23,540
All right, listen. You know how a normal person gets up and...

802
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:26,160
goes downstairs...

803
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,720
and eats breakfast...

804
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,510
and kisses somebody good-bye, and goes to...

805
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:36,560
a job and, you know.

806
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:38,280
No.

807
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,980
No?

808
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:43,620
All right, look.

809
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:49,590
Vicki, what I'm trying to tell you is...

810
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,620
Hey, it's okay.

811
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:56,760
- You can tell me. - Okay.

812
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:02,310
What I'm trying to tell you is...

813
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:04,460
is a ...

814
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:08,320
- I'll be right back. - All right.

815
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:19,230
Miss me?

816
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:27,390
Nice place you got here. Lots of space.

817
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:31,730
Vicki, we really should have a talk.

818
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:34,550
I'm very upset.

819
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,280
We were having dinner.

820
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:41,410
I was a man doing well with a beautiful woman.

821
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:45,430
And without so much as an apology...

822
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:49,080
you ran off with that sideshow phony.

823
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:55,260
You know, Vic...

824
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,130
I've recently had a tragedy in my life.

825
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,890
Alicia...

826
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:05,090
threw herself out of the window.

827
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,820
Oh, my God.

828
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:10,560
But...

829
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,230
you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs.

830
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,290
Well, Ms. Vale...

831
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:30,620
another rooster in the hen-house?

832
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:36,300
Take thy beak from out my heart.

833
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,380
Bruce?

834
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,930
Bruce Wayne, n'est-ce pas?

835
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,730
Most of the time.

836
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,480
I know who you are.

837
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,280
Let me tell you about this guy I know, Jack.

838
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:07,610
Mean kid. Bad seed. Hurt people.

839
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:11,410
I like him already.

840
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:15,460
You know what the problem was?

841
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,890
He got sloppy. You know, crazy.

842
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:23,380
He started to lose it. He had a head full of bad wiring, I guess.

843
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:26,180
Couldn't keep it straight up here.

844
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,810
He was the kind of guy who...

845
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:34,190
couldn't hear the train until it was 2 feet from him.

846
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:41,530
You know what happened to this guy, Jack?

847
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,020
Listen.

848
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:47,990
He made mistakes.

849
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:53,200
Then he ended up with his lights out! Now you want to get nuts?

850
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:56,030
Come on! Let's get nuts!

851
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:58,840
Tell me something, my friend.

852
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:03,090
You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?

853
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:04,540
What?

854
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:07,550
I always ask that of all my prey.

855
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:11,720
I just like the sound of it.

856
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:18,770
Never rub another man's rhubarb.

857
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:29,700
Why is it every time we got company...

858
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:32,670
somebody always gets in the way?

859
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:35,160
I'll need a moment alone, boys.

860
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:41,090
I'm only laughing on the outside.

861
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:44,920
My smile is just skin-deep.

862
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,840
If you could see inside...

863
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:50,590
I'm really crying.

864
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:56,040
You might join me for a weep.

865
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,880
You wouldn't believe it. You really wouldn't.

866
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:47,180
While you were out entertaining, I've been here finding out about your street corner.

867
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:48,390
Vale

868
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:51,760
I think your friend Wayne is really screwed up.

869
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:54,600
More good news.

870
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:57,620
Here.

871
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:03,570
Oh, my God!

872
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:06,900
His parents were murdered in that alley.

873
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:11,500
That's why he went there.

874
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:16,620
Poor kid watched the whole thing happen in front of him.

875
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:19,040
Look at the look on the face.

876
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,960
It was the same in front of City Hall.

877
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:29,200
What do you suppose something like this does to a kid?

878
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:31,300
Vale

879
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:34,700
Don't get personal!

880
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:47,150
Alfred

881
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:49,900
Did you get the file on my parents?

882
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:52,530
It's on your table, sir.

883
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,180
Thank you.

884
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:04,090
What's on your mind, Alfred?

885
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:08,550
I have no wish to fill my few remaining years...

886
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:11,560
grieving for the loss of old friends...

887
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:18,890
or their sons.

888
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:40,250
The 200th anniversary birthday gala has been indefinitely postponed.

889
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:43,340
We simply cannot guarantee public safety...

890
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:44,510
Joker here.

891
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:46,750
We got interference. Call the OB unit.

892
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:49,920
Now you fellows have said some pretty mean things...

893
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:52,340
some of which were true...

894
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:55,320
under that fiend, Boss Grissom.

895
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:58,220
He was a thief and a terrorist.

896
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:02,140
On the other hand, he had a tremendous singing voice.

897
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:08,520
He's dead now, and he's left me in charge.

898
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:11,750
Now, I can be theatrical...

899
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:14,760
and maybe even a little rough.

900
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:17,740
But one thing I am not...

901
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:19,540
is a killer!

902
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:23,060
I'm an artist.

903
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:25,830
I love a good party.

904
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:28,000
So, truce.

905
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:32,220
Commence au festival!

906
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:36,220
And I've got a surprise for Gotham City.

907
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:41,430
At midnight, I will dump $20 million in cash...

908
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:43,630
on the crowd.

909
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:49,520
Don't worry about me. I've got enough.

910
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:52,980
We are not prepared to discuss any deals.

911
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:57,130
You heard it, folks, $20 million.

912
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,830
And there will be entertainment.

913
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:05,170
The big dukeroo. With me in one corner, and in the other corner...

914
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:09,880
the man who has brought real terror to Gotham City...

915
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:11,840
Batman.

916
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,820
Can you hear me?

917
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:15,760
Just the two of us.

918
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:18,730
Mano y mano.

919
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,530
I have taken off my make-up.

920
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:23,980
Let's see...

921
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:27,240
if you can take off yours.

922
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,460
Tell me, kid.

923
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:46,460
You ever dance with the devil by the pale moonlight?

924
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:56,080
Let's go!

925
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:00,390
Let's go, Jack!

926
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:05,690
See you around, kid.

927
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:26,460
Thanks.

928
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:33,550
Hi.

929
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:37,310
Tell me if I'm crazy.

930
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:43,060
But that wasn't just another night for either of us, was it?

931
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:50,900
I mean, we both got to each other, didn't we?

932
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:54,450
Why won't you let me in?

933
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,450
Why?

934
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:01,160
You got in.

935
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:08,380
I've loved you since I met you.

936
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:13,040
But I don't know what to think of all this. I really don't.

937
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:15,960
Sometimes I don't know what to think about this.

938
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:17,880
It's just something I have to do.

939
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:19,560
Why?

940
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:21,810
Because nobody else can.

941
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:27,770
I tried to avoid all this, but I can't.

942
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:30,230
This is how it is.

943
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,770
It's not a perfect world.

944
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:35,860
It doesn't have to be a perfect world.

945
01:33:39,690 --> 01:33:44,160
I just gotta know, are we going to try to love each other?

946
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,000
I'd like to.

947
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,380
But he's out there right now.

948
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:55,570
And I've got to go to work.

949
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:39,310
Into the air, Junior Birdman!

950
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:40,950
Missed me!

951
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:45,510
Yeah! Watch me!

952
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:08,050
Get them. Take the pictures.

953
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,640
Gotham's greed.

954
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:41,120
And now, folks...

955
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,660
it's time for, "Who Do You Trust?"

956
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:46,820
Money, money! Who do you trust?

957
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:49,960
Me? I'm giving away free money.

958
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:54,010
And where is the Batman?

959
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:57,600
He's at home, washing his tights.

960
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:10,070
Winged battle flies through the night and finds me ready.

961
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:12,330
Bob. Mask.

962
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:15,450
Masks! Put them on now!

963
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:17,580
And now...

964
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:20,580
comes the part...

965
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,750
where I relieve you, the little people...

966
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:27,130
of the burden of your failed...

967
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:28,590
and useless lives.

968
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:33,550
But, as my plastic surgeon always said, "If you got to go...

969
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:35,640
"go with a smile."

970
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:07,840
Oh, my God!

971
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:09,920
Smylex gas.

972
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:12,590
He's going to kill everybody!

973
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:15,050
Get in the car. Get in the car!

974
01:40:22,970 --> 01:40:24,560
Hurry!

975
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:17,180
My balloons!

976
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:29,730
Those are my balloons!

977
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:58,470
He stole my balloons!

978
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:03,010
Why didn't somebody tell me he had one of those things?

979
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,020
Bob. Gun.

980
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:15,980
I'm going to need a minute or two alone, boys.

981
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:18,740
Come on, get out of here!

982
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:14,340
Come on, you gruesome son of a bitch. Come to me.

983
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:52,890
Darling.

984
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,980
I've got to get you to the church on time.

985
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:03,280
Yes, sir?

986
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:07,110
Gotham City Cathedral. Transportation for two.

987
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:10,870
- Right away, sir? - Five minutes.

988
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:18,890
- Better make it 10. - Okay, 10 minutes.

989
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:21,210
All right, let's go, men, let's go.

990
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:55,990
You men go that way. Rest of you, follow me.

991
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:49,590
Let's go.

992
01:49:57,210 --> 01:50:01,180
Point those searchlights up at the tower, right now! Move!

993
01:50:30,910 --> 01:50:35,220
It can be truly said that I have a bat in my belfry.

994
01:50:44,050 --> 01:50:45,890
Shall we dance?

995
01:52:07,550 --> 01:52:10,560
You know, without you...

996
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:13,770
I just wouldn't want to go on.

997
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:40,070
It's as though we were made for each other.

998
01:53:40,190 --> 01:53:42,650
Beauty and the Beast.

999
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:46,020
Of course, if anyone else calls you "beast"...

1000
01:53:46,050 --> 01:53:48,370
I'll rip their lungs out.

1001
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:20,860
Mr. Joker?

1002
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:27,160
You say such beautiful things.

1003
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:31,740
And you're so powerful. And purple!

1004
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:36,590
I love purple!

1005
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:39,210
Excuse me.

1006
01:54:39,450 --> 01:54:42,800
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?

1007
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:48,300
I'm going to kill you.

1008
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:50,670
You idiot!

1009
01:54:50,710 --> 01:54:53,010
You made me, remember?

1010
01:54:53,050 --> 01:54:55,220
You dropped me into that vat of chemicals!

1011
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:59,760
That wasn't easy to get over! And don't think that I didn't try.

1012
01:54:59,790 --> 01:55:01,320
I know you did.

1013
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,630
You killed my parents.

1014
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:32,060
What?

1015
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,640
What are you talking about?

1016
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:38,470
I made you, you made me first.

1017
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:41,450
Hey, bat-brain, I was a kid when I killed your parents.

1018
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:44,390
When I say I made you, you gotta say you made me.

1019
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:46,900
How childish can you get?

1020
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:50,160
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses on, would you?

1021
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:07,970
What are you laughing at?

1022
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:17,260
Here, let me lend you a hand.

1023
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:26,690
Lend you a hand.

1024
01:56:34,030 --> 01:56:37,000
They don't make them like they used to!

1025
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:42,330
Hey, Batsy!

1026
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:59,240
There he is! Down there! Go down!

1027
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,240
It's time to retire.

1028
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:17,200
Feel free to drop in.

1029
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:29,130
Sometimes I just kill myself!

1030
01:57:32,710 --> 01:57:34,170
Come on.

1031
01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:35,640
Hold on!

1032
01:59:46,430 --> 01:59:50,940
Our police have rounded up all the Joker's men.

1033
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:53,650
The reign of crime is over.

1034
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:57,650
Public safety in Gotham City is no longer a laughing matter.

1035
01:59:57,680 --> 02:00:00,150
Aren't you covering this press conference?

1036
02:00:00,180 --> 02:00:01,280
No.

1037
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:03,620
What about our Pulitzer Prize?

1038
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:05,700
What about us?

1039
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,750
What about your picture of Batman?

1040
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,800
Take care, Allie.

1041
02:00:21,090 --> 02:00:24,260
We've received a letter from Batman this morning.

1042
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:28,350
"Please inform the citizens of Gotham...

1043
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:31,520
"that Gotham City's earned a rest from crime.

1044
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:35,770
"But if the forces of evil should rise again...

1045
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:38,990
"to cast a shadow on the heart of the city...

1046
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:40,740
"call me. "

1047
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:45,310
Question. How do we call him?

1048
02:00:48,610 --> 02:00:50,710
He gave us a signal.

1049
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:29,370
I thought champagne would be in order, ma'am.

1050
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:31,040
Hi, Alfred.

1051
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:41,710
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you...

1052
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:44,050
that he might be a little late.

1053
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:49,180
I'm not a bit surprised.
