<i>Fear does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

3
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:44,173
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

4
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,302
<i>Pain does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

5
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:48,638
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

6
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:51,767
<i>Defeat does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

7
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,268
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

8
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:56,481
<i>Fear does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

9
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:57,900
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

10
00:00:57,983 --> 00:01:01,154
<i>Pain does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

11
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:02,614
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

12
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:06,244
<i>Defeat does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

13
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:07,788
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

14
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:09,456
Prepare!

15
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:16,257
We do not train to be merciful here.
Mercy is for the weak.

16
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:21,139
Here, on the street, in competition,
a man confronts you, he's the enemy.

17
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:25,185
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,818
Class, we have visitors.

19
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:40,372
I hear you jumped
some of my students last night.

20
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:42,791
Afraid the facts mixed up.

21
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:46,755
Now you get your boy on the mat
or you and I will have a major problem.

22
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:49,300
<i>Too much advantage, your dojo.</i>

23
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:52,387
Name a place.

24
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:54,390
Tournament.

25
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:58,020
Come on, Johnny, kill him!

26
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,903
<i>Point! Chop! That's two for LaRusso!</i>

27
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:06,615
Time out, time out.

28
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:09,075
<i>Go to your sensei. Turn. Kneel.</i>

29
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:11,954
Hey, Johnny, you're a cream-puff!

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,083
Sweep the leg.

31
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:19,173
You have a problem with that?

32
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:22,761
<i>No, Sensei.</i>

33
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:25,932
No mercy.

34
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,236
Warning for illegal contact to the knees.

35
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:36,779
Ready?

36
00:02:36,862 --> 00:02:38,990
No mercy! No mercy!

37
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,867
Weigh the fist, Johnny.

38
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:42,370
Finish him!

39
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,050
Winner!

40
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:02,896
Now who's the loser?

41
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,732
You're really sick, man.

42
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:07,026
How does second place feel now?

43
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,155
- He can't breathe.
- Mind your business.

44
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:12,576
<i>- You're gonna kill him.
- Sensei, please. You're hurting him.</i>

45
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,871
He's sorry, okay? He really is.

46
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:17,457
Let him go.

47
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,668
Beat it, slope, or you're next.

48
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:55,590
"Mercy is for the weak.

49
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:58,719
"We do not train to be merciful here.

50
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:01,598
"A man face you, he is enemy.

51
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:05,394
"Enemy deserve no mercy."

52
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:21,290
<i>Come, Daniel-san.</i>

53
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:23,085
Time go home.

54
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,256
<i>- You could have killed him, couldn't you?
- Hai.</i>

55
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,715
Why didn't you then?

56
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:31,596
<i>Because, Daniel-san,
for person with no forgiveness in heart...</i>

57
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,599
<i>... living even worse punishment
than death.</i>

58
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:43,357
<i>Sensei Kreese, this is Pat Johnson
from the All Valley Tournament.</i>

59
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,400
<i>We're sorry you lost all your students.</i>

60
00:05:45,484 --> 00:05:48,488
<i>I guess the Cobra Kai won't
enter the tournament this year.</i>

61
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:51,200
<i>We've made repeated requests
for payments of dues...</i>

62
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:53,578
<i>... but since you've failed to respond...</i>

63
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:56,874
<i>... we have to drop the Cobra Kai
from our membership rolls.</i>

64
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,087
<i>If you have any questions, give me a call.
Have a nice day.</i>

65
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,964
<i>Mr. Kreese, this is Pacific Bell.</i>

66
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:06,262
<i>This is the final call regarding your bill,
and if you do not pay immediately...</i>

67
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,991
Mr. Kreese, good morning.
What a surprise. Some coffee?

68
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,660
- Where's the boss?
- He's upstairs.

69
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:25,996
Thanks.

70
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,965
Come on!

71
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,647
You're telegraphing that wheel kick.

72
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:21,109
Johnny!

73
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:23,488
What a surprise, man!

74
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:24,739
Yes!

75
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:28,160
What's this? You moving in?

76
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:30,872
This is "I give up." I came to say good-bye.

77
00:07:30,956 --> 00:07:33,501
<i>- Here are the dojo keys.
- What are you talking about?</i>

78
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:35,211
I'll pay you that back rent soon.

79
00:07:35,294 --> 00:07:38,423
You think I bought that place for the rent?
I bought it for you.

80
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:39,634
- Mr. Silver?
- What?

81
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:41,261
The plutonium deal.

82
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,640
Johnny, every business has a slump
at one time or another.

83
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:47,143
Ten years ago
nuclear was the preferred waste.

84
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:50,064
You could dump it anywhere.
Now, everybody's a detective.

85
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:53,068
I'm lucky if I make one deal a year
without being indicted.

86
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:54,194
Thank you.

87
00:07:54,278 --> 00:07:55,487
Let's get some air.

88
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:58,616
It's been nine months since a student
walked through my doors.

89
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,453
You're not listening to me.
Come on, snap out of it.

90
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:02,831
I can't.

91
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,710
I'm broke and I'm going nowhere.

92
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:08,212
You're wrong.

93
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,716
You're going to Tahiti.

94
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:11,801
Now.

95
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:14,721
All right, I've made up my mind.

96
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:17,141
This slope, Miyagi, and that punk kid...

97
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:19,144
...I'll get them for what they did to you.

98
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:21,606
They made you suffer,
so I'll make them suffer.

99
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:26,236
When I think they've suffered enough,
then I start with the pain.

100
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,824
- Terry, you don't have to do that.
- Don't have to? I want to.

101
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,994
It's not over. We're Cobra Kai.

102
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,956
Come on, say it. Cobra Kai.

103
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:38,002
Say it! Cobra Kai.

104
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,421
- Never dies.
- You bet your ass.

105
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:42,633
- I owe you, man.
- You don't owe me anything.

106
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:45,386
I don't owe you anything?
What about Vietnam?

107
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,473
How many times did you save my ass?

108
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:50,309
I don't know. I lost count.

109
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,231
Get the hell out of here.

110
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:00,490
Have a good trip, Captain.

111
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:12,505
<i>The White Zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading of passengers only.</i>

112
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:14,800
Smog.

113
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:17,220
Smells like home, huh, Mr. Miyagi?

114
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:23,018
<i>Daniel-san,
why mother not here to meet you?</i>

115
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:25,063
You tell her right flight number?

116
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:28,067
I told her the right flight.
I just told her the wrong day.

117
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,530
I told her we were coming in tomorrow.
She loves surprises.

118
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,032
Hope so.

119
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:37,579
We take taxi apartment house.
Then Miyagi go back to work.

120
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:41,376
<i>106 Los Angeles. Crank it up!</i>

121
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,827
What are you doing in my cab?

122
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,373
- We just came from the airport.
- I thought that was the cab I ordered.

123
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:14,336
- Mrs. Milo, what's going on?
- What does it seem? Progress.

124
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,756
I got a message for you from your mother.

125
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,221
I told you that bum would sell the place
and you'd be out of a job someday.

126
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:24,098
You wouldn't listen to me.

127
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:25,768
- What's the message?
- What message?

128
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:29,230
- The one from my mother.
- She said call her at your Uncle Louie's.

129
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,527
No worry nothing, Mrs. LaRusso.

130
00:10:34,905 --> 00:10:37,199
<i>Daniel-san room all finished.</i>

131
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:41,872
Yeah, I take good care of him.
You just look out Uncle Louie.

132
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,542
I might be here for a few months.

133
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:48,464
A 70-year-old man gets emphysema,
it's no joke, you know.

134
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,302
Are you sure there's no problem
for him to stay with you?

135
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,805
No problem.

136
00:10:53,972 --> 00:10:55,014
Pleasure.

137
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:56,724
<i>Mr. Miyagi, thank you.</i>

138
00:10:57,101 --> 00:11:00,605
<i>Welcome. Bye-bye. Here Daniel-san.</i>

139
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,148
Nice mama.

140
00:11:02,732 --> 00:11:04,568
You sure you don't need me there?

141
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:07,656
<i>No. You stay with Mr. Miyagi
and start college.</i>

142
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:12,328
I can't believe it, "Mr. College Man."
When's registration?

143
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:14,790
<i>It's this Tuesday.
And classes start Thursday.</i>

144
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:16,710
And when is Kumiko arriving?

145
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,755
She's not.

146
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,303
She got this great job
with a dance company in Tokyo.

147
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:26,889
I guess she just couldn't say no, so...

148
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:29,810
You're disappointed, huh?

149
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:33,815
Yep. But that's life, I guess.
I'll survive.

150
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:36,068
You'll do more than just survive.

151
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:39,072
I gotta go, okay?

152
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,533
Listen, Uncle Louie says hi,
and I love you.

153
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:44,370
Okay, say hi to Uncle Louie.
I love you, too.

154
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:56,094
The little maple's still in there.
I'll get it.

155
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:58,096
No. I go.

156
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,195
Mr. Miyagi, you okay?

157
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:50,833
Just remembering.

158
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:58,217
I'll bet there are a lot of memories
here for you.

159
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:04,892
So what are you going to do now?

160
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:09,858
Don't know.

161
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:15,031
<i>Well, did you ever think about
opening a bonsai store?</i>

162
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:19,746
<i>Hai, Daniel-san.</i>

163
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:21,873
In my dream.

164
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,251
My retirement.

165
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:29,132
What do you call this?

166
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,602
Call "time to go."

167
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:07,557
<i>You know, I've been thinking about
the bonsai shop idea.</i>

168
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:10,812
You already have all the stock.
How hard can it be?

169
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:12,940
<i>Not too hard, Daniel-san...</i>

170
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:18,239
...if Miyagi have money for lease,
deposit, fix-up.

171
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:22,411
But since we build house
for Yukie in Okinawa...

172
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:25,581
...money very short supply.

173
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:26,874
"Supply"?

174
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:29,795
Supplies are us.

175
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:35,302
<i>Thank you, Daniel-san,
but that not money.</i>

176
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:40,350
It looks like money. Smells like money.
Good money. Smell that.

177
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:42,395
Smell like college education.

178
00:14:42,478 --> 00:14:44,732
I know, Mr. Miyagi,
but I have a great idea...

179
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:46,316
<i>Daniel-san.</i>

180
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:48,069
No idea.

181
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:51,365
Discussion closed.

182
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,869
But what about your dream?

183
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:57,373
And, Mr. Miyagi, no offence,
but if you miss the train this time...

184
00:14:57,457 --> 00:15:00,210
...there may not be another one
for a long time.

185
00:15:00,294 --> 00:15:02,171
Then Miyagi take bus.

186
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:29,999
Revenge? Of course you want revenge.
I'm gonna get it for you.

187
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:34,046
<i>The day you step off the plane, you're
the biggest dojo operator in the valley.</i>

188
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:35,965
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

189
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,178
I bought 20 locations today.
Yours, 100 percent.

190
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:42,307
You are back, my man,
bigger and badder than ever.

191
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,226
<i>You're a sweetheart, that's great!</i>

192
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:46,562
But what about those two jerks?

193
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,109
<i>Those two jerks are taking up
100 percent of my time from now on.</i>

194
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:53,113
So just have patience.
I'm just getting things rolling.

195
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:57,201
When I'm finished with that kid,
he'll be begging me to be his teacher.

196
00:15:57,284 --> 00:15:59,329
You know what he's gonna learn from me?

197
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:04,293
Pain in every part of his body
and fear in every part of his mind.

198
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:07,631
And here's the kicker:
he's gonna thank me for it.

199
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,259
What about the old man?

200
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,010
Him I hurt for the kid.

201
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,641
By the time that little twerp
steps into the ring to defend his title...

202
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,436
...I'm gonna have him thinking
he's invincible.

203
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,816
Then he's gonna find out
what pain and fear really mean...

204
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:23,026
...right in front of a thousand people.

205
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:25,113
How do you know he'll compete?

206
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:28,159
He'll compete. Don't worry about it.
You just have fun.

207
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:30,954
<i>Go give Mimona and her girlfriend
a squeeze for me.</i>

208
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:32,289
How do you know about her?

209
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:33,833
I know.

210
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:37,379
<i>Anything else you want?</i>

211
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,049
Yeah.

212
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,763
Make his knuckles bleed.

213
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:52,065
I like that, Johnny.
I'm gonna use that.

214
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:57,530
I'm going to be working full-time
on this from now on.

215
00:16:57,614 --> 00:16:58,740
Very good, sir.

216
00:16:58,823 --> 00:17:00,951
No, it's too nice.
I gotta look poor.

217
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:03,747
This isn't bad. Fix the collar.
Make me look humble.

218
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,876
- About the Borneo call?
- All right, but that's the last one.

219
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,379
For the next few weeks,
my business is revenge.

220
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,215
Everything is in place, sir.

221
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,968
All right,
let's see what you've got for me.

222
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:16,180
Cute but wrong.

223
00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:19,226
It's got no character.

224
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:20,936
A truck.

225
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:25,358
Yeah, I like it. Make sure it runs.

226
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:26,360
Yes, sir.

227
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:29,239
- Where are the magazines I ordered?
- Right here, sir.

228
00:17:29,322 --> 00:17:32,785
- Have a very pleasant evening, sir.
- Thank you, Margaret.

229
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:02,157
"Karate's bad boy.

230
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,825
"Mike Barnes."

231
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:13,629
Perfect.

232
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:24,811
Mr. Miyagi, I'm home.

233
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:27,523
<i>Daniel-san, just in time.</i>

234
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,776
How was fishing?

235
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,695
We find out pretty soon.

236
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,866
So, how first day at college?

237
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,242
College?

238
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:38,037
College...

239
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:43,001
College is...
Well, you know college, Mr. Miyagi.

240
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:46,840
It's a place that I didn't go to today.

241
00:18:48,258 --> 00:18:49,301
What?

242
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:53,140
Mr. Miyagi,
may all your dreams come true.

243
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,269
What this?

244
00:18:56,394 --> 00:18:58,563
There's only one way to find out.

245
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:02,945
All right, I'll tell you.

246
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:05,030
It's my college diploma.

247
00:19:05,114 --> 00:19:07,575
- What?
- I'm only joking.

248
00:19:08,618 --> 00:19:11,330
<i>Daniel-san, you have sense humour.</i>

249
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:14,751
"Lease."

250
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:18,381
<i>For your new bonsai store.
Congratulations.</i>

251
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:21,301
"One month security, two month rent."

252
00:19:21,385 --> 00:19:25,181
Yes. With just enough left over
for renovations, if we're careful.

253
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:30,772
<i>Daniel-san, thank you very much,
but cannot accept.</i>

254
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:33,901
But it's your dream, Mr. Miyagi.
Why not?

255
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:37,865
Because money in pocket
was not for Miyagi dream.

256
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:40,160
Was for college education.

257
00:19:40,243 --> 00:19:43,289
I know, just listen to me for a minute.

258
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:46,960
I know me. I just can't take courses
to take courses.

259
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,714
I'll get bored.
Once it happens, forget about it.

260
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:51,467
It's bye-bye college.

261
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:55,722
I've been going to school non-stop
since I'm five. I could use the break.

262
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:58,434
<i>- I don't know, Daniel-san.
- I do.</i>

263
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,686
- Just come with me a second.
- Where?

264
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:02,481
- Come with me.
- What about fish?

265
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:05,026
The fish is not going anyplace.
That fish is dead.

266
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:10,032
What a moment!

267
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:13,495
You are now crossing over
to the right side of the tracks.

268
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:16,040
- What that?
- That's opportunity knocking.

269
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:17,918
Straight ahead. Right up there.

270
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,838
Your dream come true,
and there's plenty of free parking.

271
00:20:20,922 --> 00:20:22,465
Right here, Mr. Miyagi.

272
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:25,719
- This place?
- This place. Wait till you see it up close.

273
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:32,937
So, is this the opportunity
of a lifetime or what?

274
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:36,149
Now, I know you're worried
about this area...

275
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:39,947
...but the landlord says
this neighbourhood is up and coming.

276
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,118
We're in on the ground floor over here.
Look, a pottery shop across the street.

277
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:47,414
<i>We could set a deal,
get some planters made up for the bonsai.</i>

278
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:50,460
Wait till you see inside, man.
This is going to be great.

279
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:52,462
This is going to be great.

280
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:56,343
Come on in.

281
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:03,269
Mr. Miyagi, welcome to your dream.

282
00:21:04,353 --> 00:21:07,524
Now don't let this throw you.
Looks can be deceiving.

283
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:09,443
We have to think potential here.

284
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:11,320
Think potential, all right?

285
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:13,782
You see all this stuff? Everything in here?

286
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:17,912
You own it. Everything.
It's all yours. You could use this stuff.

287
00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:21,292
This is good wood.
We can make shelves out of this stuff.

288
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,004
Back here,
I thought this would be a great spot...

289
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:26,799
<i>...up here, to do like a bonsai display.</i>

290
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:30,471
All those pine trees you have?
We could show them in different stages.

291
00:21:30,554 --> 00:21:32,849
You know, the possibilities are endless.

292
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:36,395
Over here, right,
I thought this would be a great spot...

293
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,105
...for a little work area.

294
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,821
<i>Over here we got like a bonsai hospital.
The little guys get sick. Take care of them.</i>

295
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:46,492
I work for free. And I thought of a name.

296
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:47,784
Check it out.

297
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:50,121
"Mr. Miyagi's Little Trees."

298
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:52,833
Simple, direct, catchy.

299
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:55,629
It doesn't look it now,
but this place is a gold mine.

300
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:59,342
I know you can make it work, Mr. Miyagi.
If anyone can, you can.

301
00:22:02,095 --> 00:22:04,641
What did I do? Did I forget something?

302
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:07,978
Well, what did I miss?

303
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:10,565
Your name on lease, next to mine.

304
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:14,195
- Partner.
- Partner?

305
00:22:15,154 --> 00:22:17,783
Yes! Mr. Miyagi, this is gonna be great.

306
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,093
You're welcome.

307
00:22:34,597 --> 00:22:35,765
What?

308
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:38,727
Don't bullshit me.

309
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:41,022
What do you mean
you can't dump it in Borneo?

310
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:43,233
Who in Borneo
knows what chloride sludge is?

311
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:44,485
Just do it!

312
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:45,987
Do it!

313
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:47,989
Call me when it's dumped.

314
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:49,450
Where were we, Margaret?

315
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:52,663
"And, in conclusion,
I reject your final offer.

316
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:57,293
"If you proceed,
I'll sue your collective asses accordingly."

317
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:00,297
Best to Lorna and the kids. Sincerely...

318
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,425
Yeah?

319
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,344
Good, bring him in.

320
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:05,596
What else?

321
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:09,142
The grand jury.
What do you intend to do about them?

322
00:23:09,226 --> 00:23:10,811
Bribe them, as usual.

323
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,106
Lighten up, Margaret.

324
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:15,651
- Who's the DA on the case?
- Mr. Cole.

325
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:16,819
Good.

326
00:23:16,944 --> 00:23:20,573
Let's invite Willie to dinner Tuesday night.
We'll have his favourite.

327
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:22,326
- Poached salmon.
- Very well.

328
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,703
Mr. Silver?

329
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:26,623
You must be Mike Barnes. Welcome to LA.

330
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:29,001
Thank you for bringing me down,
Mr. Silver.

331
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:31,004
Milos, call the boys.

332
00:23:31,922 --> 00:23:33,841
This place is intense.

333
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:36,386
- Consider it home.
- Thanks.

334
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:38,472
Snake, Dennis.

335
00:23:38,556 --> 00:23:39,598
Mike Barnes.

336
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:43,478
Dennis will take care of your training.
Snake takes care of everything else.

337
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:47,234
If you're looking to be a bad boy in LA,
Snake's the boy to be bad with.

338
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:48,694
You know it.

339
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,073
You get a weekly draw and a car.
Any questions?

340
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:54,493
Remember on the phone you said
if I come here...

341
00:23:54,577 --> 00:23:57,497
...and I beat this LaRusso
in the All Valley Tournament...

342
00:23:57,581 --> 00:24:00,710
<i>...that you'd give me 25 percent ownership
in your new dojos?</i>

343
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:03,046
Which I think is more than generous.

344
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:05,382
But I've been giving it some thought.

345
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:09,304
For me to do my absolute best,
which is what I want to do for you...

346
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:11,766
...l'm afraid I'm gonna need 50 percent.

347
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,103
Fifty percent?

348
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:19,359
Well, I don't know
if I can afford more than 35.

349
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,407
I understand. I guess I'd better get going.

350
00:24:24,491 --> 00:24:26,494
It was nice meeting everybody.

351
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,458
- Do you fight as hard as you negotiate?
- Harder.

352
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:33,086
You got your 50 percent.

353
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:35,964
- And I get that in writing?
- By noon today.

354
00:24:36,673 --> 00:24:40,428
You just bought yourself a champion.

355
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,264
You remember that.

356
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,602
- Snake, show him to his room.
- Yes, sir.

357
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:49,273
See you later, Mike.
Milos, my blue pinstripe.

358
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:55,407
So, what do you think?

359
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,950
He's obnoxious.

360
00:24:58,118 --> 00:24:59,912
Yeah, he's perfect.

361
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,675
<i>Very good. This make special bonsai.</i>

362
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,178
<i>You really see a bonsai in here?</i>

363
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,680
Where?

364
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:14,932
Inside.

365
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,267
Inside?

366
00:25:16,434 --> 00:25:18,311
<i>Hello, any bonsai in here?</i>

367
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,400
<i>Daniel-san, not inside. Inside you.</i>

368
00:25:22,483 --> 00:25:24,987
Same place your karate come from.

369
00:25:25,112 --> 00:25:27,072
But my karate comes from you.

370
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:31,662
Only root karate come from Miyagi.

371
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:38,004
<i>Just like bonsai choose own way grow.
Because the root is strong.</i>

372
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:42,843
You choose own way.
Do karate same reason.

373
00:25:42,968 --> 00:25:45,138
Yeah, but I do it your way.

374
00:25:46,056 --> 00:25:48,934
One day you do own way.

375
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,406
<i>Remember what you said before about
bonsai being free to grow as they choose?</i>

376
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,659
<i>All bonsai aren't free to choose.</i>

377
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:05,498
We tell them how to grow
by using clippers and then the wire.

378
00:26:06,082 --> 00:26:09,586
<i>But, Daniel-san,
our bonsai not true bonsai.</i>

379
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:13,217
<i>True bonsai grow wild. Very rare.</i>

380
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,760
You ever seen any?

381
00:26:15,344 --> 00:26:16,387
Okinawa.

382
00:26:16,554 --> 00:26:17,931
What about here?

383
00:26:18,014 --> 00:26:19,475
I only know of one.

384
00:26:20,684 --> 00:26:22,561
What did it do, immigrate?

385
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,527
With Miyagi.
Only thing Miyagi bring from Okinawa.

386
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:29,530
Where's the tree now?

387
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:31,740
There.

388
00:26:31,865 --> 00:26:33,535
Devil's Caldron.

389
00:26:36,205 --> 00:26:37,581
Devil's Caldron?

390
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:41,086
<i>No can see bonsai from here.</i>

391
00:26:41,878 --> 00:26:44,966
Good place. Very safe. Nobody bother.

392
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:47,636
Why did you put it
in such a hard place to get to?

393
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:50,765
<i>True original bonsai
worth many thousand dollar.</i>

394
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:54,728
<i>Come, time learn special
Miyagi-family kata.</i>

395
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:56,189
Now you ready.

396
00:26:56,273 --> 00:27:00,987
<i>Like all bonsai found in tree,
all karate found in this kata.</i>

397
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,574
<i>Come, together we do kata.</i>

398
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:30,229
Hi, Mr. Miyagi.

399
00:28:30,312 --> 00:28:33,316
I brought this tree,
the one you were working on this morning.

400
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,653
I thought you might want
to give it another try.

401
00:28:35,736 --> 00:28:36,612
Thank you.

402
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:39,741
A change of scenery
might bring what's inside outside.

403
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:42,120
- Where should I put it?
- Over here.

404
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:44,038
Very good.

405
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:47,543
You've done a lot of work here.
This place is bigger than I thought.

406
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,172
- There's your charcoal.
- Thank you.

407
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:52,425
Perfect.

408
00:28:54,552 --> 00:28:56,680
I hope you don't mind...

409
00:28:58,141 --> 00:29:00,435
...but I opened that letter.

410
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:03,564
The one that came today
from the All Valley Tournament.

411
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:05,692
There's a new rule this year.

412
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:09,322
- Would you like to read about it?
- No.

413
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:12,951
That's okay because I got it memorised.
It says:

414
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:14,496
"Under the new rules...

415
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:17,917
"...the defending champion
only needs to fight in the final match."

416
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,338
Isn't that great?
That limits my fights to just one.

417
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:24,842
That's better
than what I had to put up with last year.

418
00:29:24,926 --> 00:29:27,888
And let's face it, it's another year.

419
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:30,683
It's a year later.
I'm a lot more experienced.

420
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:34,188
So I think we should
seriously reconsider this.

421
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,398
- Right?
- Wrong!

422
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:37,692
Wrong?

423
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,905
<i>Should consider get
new pot for bonsai.</i>

424
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:45,452
I don't know what the big deal is.
I mean, what is your problem with this?

425
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:51,877
If karate used defend honour,
defend a life...

426
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:54,714
...karate means something.

427
00:29:55,632 --> 00:29:58,845
If karate used defend plastic metal trophy...

428
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:02,224
...karate no mean nothing.

429
00:30:04,644 --> 00:30:06,063
Understand?

430
00:30:06,897 --> 00:30:08,149
I wish I did.

431
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:13,906
<i>Go find a nice pot for bonsai across street.</i>

432
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,041
Here's your pen.

433
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,378
Before I forget.

434
00:30:27,174 --> 00:30:31,721
And if you have a minute,
just in case you change your mind...

435
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:33,390
...here's the application.

436
00:30:33,474 --> 00:30:34,641
Okay?

437
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:39,231
It's no rush.
I mean, it says at the bottom...

438
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:42,486
We have a couple of weeks
before we have to send it in.

439
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:46,866
I'm sorry if I made it seem
like we had to do it today.

440
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,537
We have some time.

441
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:07,267
Hello?

442
00:31:08,353 --> 00:31:10,522
Hi. Could you turn that off?

443
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:11,857
Sure.

444
00:31:11,982 --> 00:31:13,234
Thanks.

445
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,779
Hang on, I'm almost finished.

446
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:17,030
That's okay.

447
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:19,116
It's okay. Take your time.

448
00:31:20,577 --> 00:31:21,995
That's pretty cool.

449
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,372
Thanks.

450
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:25,625
So, what can I do for you?

451
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:29,004
Actually, I was looking to buy some pots.

452
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:31,174
Yeah, what size?

453
00:31:34,846 --> 00:31:37,391
This would be good. Like this.

454
00:31:38,016 --> 00:31:41,354
<i>They're for bonsai trees.
We're opening a shop across the street.</i>

455
00:31:41,437 --> 00:31:43,482
Great. Welcome to the neighbourhood.

456
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:44,692
Thanks.

457
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:47,028
<i>Yeah, I love bonsai.</i>

458
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:49,531
They're so perfect, you know?

459
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:53,203
Maybe when we get our trees in
you could come visit the shop.

460
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:54,997
And meet my partner, too.

461
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,125
I haven't even really met you yet.

462
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,877
I'm sorry.

463
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:01,922
- Daniel LaRusso.
- Jessica Andrews. Hi.

464
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:04,509
Hi. Is that you in that...

465
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:06,429
Yep, that's me.

466
00:32:06,512 --> 00:32:09,224
What happened to the guy
who lost his head?

467
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:13,146
Elizabeth Anne Rooney happened to him.
The traitor.

468
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:14,981
The pots?

469
00:32:15,064 --> 00:32:16,984
You know what we could do?

470
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:22,283
<i>Could you put like a bonsai tree
on the side of the pot?</i>

471
00:32:22,366 --> 00:32:25,329
- It's sort of like our trademark.
- Like embossed?

472
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:28,248
Right on the side.
I'll draw a picture of it for you.

473
00:32:28,332 --> 00:32:30,335
That would be great.

474
00:32:30,418 --> 00:32:34,673
- Jessica, come on. I'm late, hurry up.
- Listen, I got to deal with this guy.

475
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:37,511
Thanks, I'll see you soon then.

476
00:32:37,928 --> 00:32:39,013
How soon?

477
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:41,850
How soon? Well, I don't know.

478
00:32:42,643 --> 00:32:44,603
- Busy tonight?
- No.

479
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:45,730
No?

480
00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:49,360
Well, then I'll see you tonight.
If that's okay with you?

481
00:32:49,443 --> 00:32:51,111
Okay. About 7:00?

482
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:53,198
Well, sure. 7:00 is good.

483
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:56,494
I just live right upstairs,
so go around the side, okay?

484
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:59,957
- I'll see you around the side, 7:00.
- Bye-bye.

485
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,877
Charles is going to get angry.
Open up the gate.

486
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:17,605
You found it, huh?

487
00:33:19,482 --> 00:33:20,901
Thanks to you.

488
00:33:20,985 --> 00:33:23,445
Thanks to me? I didn't do anything.

489
00:33:23,613 --> 00:33:25,323
That looks great.

490
00:33:26,616 --> 00:33:28,494
You find something?

491
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:32,708
Yeah. Yeah, actually I did.
I found a date.

492
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:35,837
You didn't send me over there
just to look at pots, did you?

493
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,464
Yeah, I knew it.

494
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:42,387
Did you sign it?

495
00:33:43,806 --> 00:33:45,308
You didn't sign it.

496
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:46,810
No.

497
00:33:51,316 --> 00:33:55,487
I understand your feelings on this.
But you have to understand mine.

498
00:33:55,571 --> 00:33:58,033
This is the biggest thing
I've ever done in my life.

499
00:33:58,116 --> 00:34:01,245
I'm proud of this title.
Why can't I defend it?

500
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:04,041
<i>Daniel-san,
you no look answer Miyagi.</i>

501
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,883
<i>Just like a bonsai live inside the tree,
answer live inside of you.</i>

502
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:15,347
The only thing living inside me right now
is a lot of confusion.

503
00:34:15,431 --> 00:34:17,558
I have the chance
to be the champion again.

504
00:34:17,642 --> 00:34:21,230
- All I have to do is put my signature to it.
- Or match to it.

505
00:34:22,148 --> 00:34:23,566
A match to it?

506
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:28,155
Then you watch confusion disappear
with the smoke.

507
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:14,670
"442nd."

508
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:37,779
What are you doing here?

509
00:37:38,404 --> 00:37:40,115
- Forget something.
- What?

510
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:43,662
For shop. Bring good luck.

511
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,958
Well, I hope it brings good customers, too.

512
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:49,753
<i>Daniel-san look good.</i>

513
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:52,255
Thanks for the shirt. I love it, man.

514
00:37:53,341 --> 00:37:54,592
What doing?

515
00:37:54,717 --> 00:37:59,307
I've been thinking about what you said,
and I decided to take your advice.

516
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:02,060
I'm going to let my confusion
go up in smoke.

517
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:03,688
I'm not entering the tournament.

518
00:38:03,771 --> 00:38:06,942
I want my karate and your karate
to mean something.

519
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:13,867
<i>Good decision, Daniel-san.</i>

520
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:17,330
This way no more bruises.
Save money on Band-Aid.

521
00:38:17,414 --> 00:38:21,210
Get out of here.
They never laid a hand on me last year.

522
00:38:21,294 --> 00:38:23,171
Just an elbow, a few feet.

523
00:38:24,006 --> 00:38:27,802
I'll never forget that knee to the groin.
That was interesting.

524
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:30,139
I'll see you later, Mr. Miyagi.

525
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:36,230
- Hi.
- Hi.

526
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,191
So, you all set to go?

527
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,405
First I gotta tell you this.

528
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:48,788
After you hear this,
you just might change your mind.

529
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:51,626
What do you have, poison oak?

530
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:53,252
A boyfriend.

531
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:58,009
You see, he was in the headless picture.
You know, we broke up two months ago.

532
00:38:58,134 --> 00:39:00,512
You mean Elizabeth Anne Rooney...

533
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:05,644
We were both a little dumb about it,
but we've been talking on the phone.

534
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:08,814
I don't know, we're gonna give it
another try when I go home.

535
00:39:08,898 --> 00:39:11,526
- Where's home?
- Columbus. Ohio.

536
00:39:12,444 --> 00:39:15,031
Yeah, I'm gonna go back
after Thanksgiving.

537
00:39:15,198 --> 00:39:17,701
- I just didn't want to lead you on.
- No.

538
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:19,453
I did come on kind of strong.

539
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,832
No, don't worry about it. It's refreshing.
We could go Dutch.

540
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,377
That sounds great.

541
00:39:25,544 --> 00:39:27,923
It's just that I've been here
for two months...

542
00:39:28,006 --> 00:39:31,344
...with absolutely nothing to do
and I haven't even met any friends.

543
00:39:31,427 --> 00:39:33,055
Meet your first friend.

544
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:34,515
All right.

545
00:39:34,598 --> 00:39:36,101
Yeah, this is wild.

546
00:39:36,184 --> 00:39:38,103
Wait till he hears about this one.

547
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:39,271
Who?

548
00:39:39,355 --> 00:39:42,734
Mr. Miyagi. He's my partner.
You wanna meet him?

549
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:43,944
Yeah, why not?

550
00:39:44,027 --> 00:39:46,322
You are about to meet the greatest guy.

551
00:39:46,406 --> 00:39:50,452
This guy, he's funny, he's smart.
You got a problem, he's got the answer.

552
00:39:50,536 --> 00:39:52,162
He's like no one you'll ever meet.

553
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:54,582
On top of that,
he happens to be my best friend.

554
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,043
Why do you call him "mister"?

555
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,253
Mr. Miyagi.

556
00:39:57,837 --> 00:40:01,049
Meet Jessica Andrews from
Columbus, Ohio, and across the street.

557
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:03,177
This is Mr. Miyagi
from Okinawa and Reseda.

558
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:05,138
- How do you do?
- Hi.

559
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:08,225
- Jessica's gonna make those pots for us.
- Very good.

560
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:11,229
- Welcome to the neighbourhood.
- Thank you very much.

561
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:13,024
How's it going so far? Good?

562
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:17,237
I never know retirement
mean such hard work.

563
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:20,616
- You like to see inside shop?
- Yeah, I'd love to.

564
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,245
Partner show you around.
Don't forget lock up.

565
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:24,496
No, I won't.

566
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,584
- Good night. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

567
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,338
- I'll see you later.
- Bye-bye.

568
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:34,927
- You see why I call him "mister"?
- Yeah. He's nice.

569
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:36,929
He's the best. Come on in.

570
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:41,311
What's this?

571
00:40:41,394 --> 00:40:44,732
That's Mr. Miyagi's.
He brought it for good luck.

572
00:40:44,815 --> 00:40:46,942
What do you think?
It is going to be great.

573
00:40:47,026 --> 00:40:49,654
- Yeah, it is.
- It needs a little work, but...

574
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,074
So where'd you meet him?

575
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,453
I met him when I moved out here.
He started teaching me karate.

576
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:55,788
Karate?

577
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,791
- You do karate?
- Yeah, I do.

578
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,128
He doesn't really look like
the karate-teacher type.

579
00:41:01,212 --> 00:41:02,963
He doesn't act like it either.

580
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:05,926
Half the time he teaches me stuff,
I don't know what it is.

581
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:07,136
What do you mean?

582
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,764
It's like that vase
you were making this morning.

583
00:41:09,847 --> 00:41:12,226
He'll make a whole karate lesson
out of that.

584
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:13,853
No, I'm not kidding.

585
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:16,565
Show me how you were making that...

586
00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:19,861
- You go up and then you go down.
- Okay, now you do that.

587
00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:21,446
Okay, go up.

588
00:41:22,197 --> 00:41:24,784
Now, okay, right, see just like that.
Now go down.

589
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:27,287
Okay, now do that again. Go up.
I'm a mugger.

590
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:30,041
I'm gonna grab you,
now grab the back of my head.

591
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,168
Then pull down and bring your knee up.

592
00:41:32,252 --> 00:41:33,713
Room for one more down there?

593
00:41:34,797 --> 00:41:36,633
- What are you doing? We're not open.
- The door was.

594
00:41:36,717 --> 00:41:38,301
I meant for business, pal.

595
00:41:38,385 --> 00:41:42,015
I didn't come here for business.
Came here to talk to you.

596
00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:44,768
We heard you weren't entering
the All Valley this year.

597
00:41:44,852 --> 00:41:46,771
Is that true, Daniel?

598
00:41:46,896 --> 00:41:48,690
- Where'd you hear that?
- Is it true?

599
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,401
Yeah, that's true. So what?

600
00:41:50,484 --> 00:41:54,156
- We'd like you to reconsider.
- Is that why you guys came down here?

601
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,286
- I need your title.
- Then enter the tournament and go for it.

602
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:00,789
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I need your title.

603
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:03,376
You don't enter
and that effects my financial future.

604
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,337
I won't let that happen. Get it?

605
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:07,882
I have nothing to prove.
I have no reason to fight.

606
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:10,761
I do. I got some money to make.
Give me the application.

607
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:12,638
Forget it. I'm not going to fight...

608
00:42:12,722 --> 00:42:13,639
Sign it!

609
00:42:18,813 --> 00:42:20,315
You sign it, man!

610
00:42:20,398 --> 00:42:22,777
Come on, man! Right now!

611
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:24,028
Let's go, punk!

612
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:27,115
Let LaRusso sleep on it.
Come on. Mike!

613
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,952
Yeah, you sleep on it.

614
00:42:30,286 --> 00:42:33,540
And you can dream about me.

615
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,460
You slimeball.

616
00:42:35,543 --> 00:42:39,298
Slimeball? That's cute.
Did your mother teach you that?

617
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:40,967
Come on, Mike.

618
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:45,598
You'll have to excuse him.
He's usually a very mellow guy.

619
00:42:46,015 --> 00:42:47,267
See you later.

620
00:42:48,727 --> 00:42:50,563
Do you know those creeps?

621
00:42:51,147 --> 00:42:52,232
No.

622
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:55,069
And I wanna keep it that way.

623
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,476
Excuse me.

624
00:43:19,852 --> 00:43:21,270
Mr. Miyagi?

625
00:43:23,565 --> 00:43:25,483
My name is Terry Silver.

626
00:43:25,608 --> 00:43:28,279
My master is Kim San Jang
of South Korea.

627
00:43:28,362 --> 00:43:30,699
My teacher sends his respects.

628
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:37,791
<i>John Kreese of the Cobra Kai dojo
was our school's number one student.</i>

629
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:40,795
Word reached us in Korea
only two months ago...

630
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:43,340
...about what happened last year
at the tournament.

631
00:43:43,424 --> 00:43:47,387
My teacher sends his apologies
for John Kreese's dishonourable actions.

632
00:43:50,767 --> 00:43:52,352
Accept apology.

633
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:56,691
I was sent here
to help John regain balance.

634
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,737
Hope you can be successful.

635
00:44:00,112 --> 00:44:02,616
Unfortunately, I arrived too late.

636
00:44:03,533 --> 00:44:05,578
I buried John last week.

637
00:44:07,914 --> 00:44:09,500
He's dead? What happened?

638
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:13,254
His doctor said it was cardiac arrest,
but I knew John better than anyone.

639
00:44:13,338 --> 00:44:14,799
Karate was his life.

640
00:44:14,882 --> 00:44:18,720
And after he lost all his students,
it just broke his heart.

641
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:22,809
John was a hero.
He wasn't always like what you saw.

642
00:44:23,267 --> 00:44:25,521
He saved my life in Vietnam.

643
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,817
War does something to a man.

644
00:44:30,986 --> 00:44:33,614
You had to have been there
to know what I mean.

645
00:44:33,697 --> 00:44:35,075
Have been.

646
00:44:36,284 --> 00:44:37,703
Do know.

647
00:44:38,621 --> 00:44:39,997
442nd?

648
00:44:42,084 --> 00:44:43,210
Man!

649
00:44:43,627 --> 00:44:46,047
More medals of honour
came out of the 442nd...

650
00:44:46,131 --> 00:44:48,509
...than all World War II put together.

651
00:44:48,592 --> 00:44:50,637
I bet you've been there.

652
00:44:51,513 --> 00:44:53,891
Is this your student? The champion?

653
00:44:54,142 --> 00:44:55,268
Yeah.

654
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:57,479
Our apologies to you, too.

655
00:44:58,939 --> 00:45:01,818
John had vowed
to come and apologise himself.

656
00:45:02,152 --> 00:45:03,529
He planned...

657
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,455
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to interrupt your training.

658
00:45:11,873 --> 00:45:13,584
Mr. Silver...

659
00:45:15,461 --> 00:45:18,131
...very sorry to hear about death of friend.

660
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,676
Me, too.

661
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,597
Thank you.

662
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:32,859
God, that's too bad.

663
00:45:34,235 --> 00:45:36,071
<i>Too bad, Daniel-san.</i>

664
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:38,909
<i>Come, we continue kata.</i>

665
00:45:52,844 --> 00:45:53,886
Hello?

666
00:45:54,805 --> 00:45:56,599
- Eat yet?
- No, I haven't.

667
00:45:56,682 --> 00:45:59,978
I was supposed to dine with my Aunt Pat.
She owns the shop.

668
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:04,943
She had to do some things, so I got stuck
with all this macaroni and cheese.

669
00:46:05,027 --> 00:46:08,197
Macaroni and cheese?
You know what I like!

670
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:10,283
I grew up on macaroni and cheese.

671
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:13,162
I never say no
when it comes to macaroni and cheese.

672
00:46:13,245 --> 00:46:15,373
- Here, have a seat.
- Thanks.

673
00:46:15,457 --> 00:46:17,710
I used to eat this stuff by the ton.

674
00:46:18,127 --> 00:46:20,547
I want you to try this, okay?
And be honest.

675
00:46:20,631 --> 00:46:21,590
Okay.

676
00:46:25,428 --> 00:46:28,599
On a scale of one to ten, I'd give it as...

677
00:46:29,975 --> 00:46:31,102
...eleven.

678
00:46:31,436 --> 00:46:33,314
Let's eat. I'm starved.

679
00:46:33,606 --> 00:46:35,483
I hope you like this.

680
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:38,946
I'm not sure if this is
exactly what you wanted, but...

681
00:46:40,073 --> 00:46:41,991
Hey, this came out great.

682
00:46:42,158 --> 00:46:44,703
- Look at the tree. You got it just right.
- Good.

683
00:46:44,787 --> 00:46:47,958
- Wait until Mr. Miyagi sees it.
- Do you think he'll like it?

684
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:50,044
Like it? He's gonna love it. Here.

685
00:46:50,127 --> 00:46:52,546
- I have something for you.
- For me?

686
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:55,592
What is this?

687
00:46:57,261 --> 00:46:59,055
The Down Stairs? What is that?

688
00:46:59,138 --> 00:47:02,309
It's a dance club. Yeah, it's great.
It's got live music.

689
00:47:02,393 --> 00:47:05,063
It's for the night before you go back home.

690
00:47:05,146 --> 00:47:07,942
I figured it would be
a nice going-away present.

691
00:47:08,067 --> 00:47:10,362
Daniel, that is so sweet.

692
00:47:12,824 --> 00:47:16,287
Come on, guys. This isn't funny anymore.
Come on, turn on the lights.

693
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:19,582
Danny, I hope you got some good news
for my friend Mike here.

694
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:21,418
- I hope so too, Daniel.
- I told you.

695
00:47:21,501 --> 00:47:24,213
I can't help you. Forget about it.
Where are you going?

696
00:47:24,297 --> 00:47:26,258
You haven't signed the application yet.

697
00:47:26,341 --> 00:47:28,845
I'm not signing the application.
I won't compete.

698
00:47:28,928 --> 00:47:30,763
Take your friends and get out of here.

699
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,975
Dennis, he didn't sign it yet.

700
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:41,445
Come on, guys.
This is getting out of hand now.

701
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:44,323
- I'm not signing the application.
- Sure you are.

702
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:47,118
I'm not going to be there.
You're wasting your time.

703
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:48,829
- Take off, all right?
- You take off!

704
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:51,750
- Come on, Dennis, take him out!
- Put his eye out!

705
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:53,585
Come on!

706
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:05,392
Come on, punk!
Let's see what you've got!

707
00:48:05,476 --> 00:48:07,019
Nice kick. Not bad.

708
00:48:07,102 --> 00:48:09,314
Better. Good, but not good enough.

709
00:48:12,735 --> 00:48:14,363
Come on, get up!

710
00:48:14,946 --> 00:48:16,949
Why are you being so stubborn?

711
00:48:17,784 --> 00:48:18,993
Don't do that!

712
00:48:22,414 --> 00:48:26,211
I am running out of patience.
Now sign it and let's get on with it.

713
00:48:26,962 --> 00:48:28,339
Stop it!

714
00:48:30,592 --> 00:48:31,885
It's your ass!

715
00:48:32,386 --> 00:48:33,972
Just get out of here!

716
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:37,393
- Save it for the tournament!
- Nail him!

717
00:48:37,476 --> 00:48:39,813
Mike, come on, let's get out of here!

718
00:48:41,022 --> 00:48:42,524
Come on, old man!

719
00:48:46,071 --> 00:48:47,656
Mike, let's go!

720
00:48:49,116 --> 00:48:50,910
Let's go! You wimp!

721
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:56,209
I'll be back, LaRusso.
I'm gonna get you.

722
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:58,253
You're finished!

723
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,756
You can't watch him forever, Buddha-head.

724
00:49:10,644 --> 00:49:12,647
<i>So, Daniel-san, time take Jessica home.</i>

725
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:14,399
Yeah. Jessica, you all right?

726
00:49:14,482 --> 00:49:16,610
Yeah. I just want to lie down.

727
00:49:30,045 --> 00:49:32,340
I can't believe you're singing.

728
00:49:32,798 --> 00:49:33,758
Forget it.

729
00:49:38,014 --> 00:49:39,557
<i>Feel lucky, Daniel-san.</i>

730
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,685
Lucky? How could you feel lucky?

731
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:45,398
<i>Feel lucky. Bonsai tree not in shop.
Safe at home.</i>

732
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,861
That makes us real lucky.
I never felt luckier in my life.

733
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,531
<i>Daniel-san, we can rebuild the shop.</i>

734
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,658
Cannot rebuild stock.

735
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:00,627
<i>We sell a few trees, fix shoji screen,
start over again.</i>

736
00:50:01,586 --> 00:50:04,965
What if those guys come back again?
What are we going to do then?

737
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:07,469
If they come back,
what are we going to do?

738
00:50:07,552 --> 00:50:10,264
Just tell me,
what do we do if they come back?

739
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,480
Sing happy song.

740
00:50:34,379 --> 00:50:37,091
Where are the trees?
Where'd you put the trees?

741
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,763
They stole them!

742
00:50:42,974 --> 00:50:45,978
I can't believe it. They stole the trees.
Don't they get it?

743
00:50:46,061 --> 00:50:49,816
I'm not going to sign this thing.
Mr. Miyagi, what are we going to do?

744
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:52,903
- Where are you going?
- Get fishing pole.

745
00:50:52,987 --> 00:50:54,321
What?

746
00:50:55,114 --> 00:50:56,783
Sometimes I don't get you.

747
00:50:56,867 --> 00:51:00,413
The shop's wrecked. We've just been
robbed, and you're going fishing.

748
00:51:00,496 --> 00:51:02,541
We're flat broke and you're going fishing.

749
00:51:02,624 --> 00:51:05,837
You're just going to fluff it off?
Doesn't this even bother you?

750
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,093
<i>Daniel-san, sometime better be bothered
on full stomach than empty one.</i>

751
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:14,931
Great, another great thought, huh?
That really does me good.

752
00:51:15,016 --> 00:51:18,645
You go fishing.
I'm going to the police to report it.

753
00:51:18,729 --> 00:51:21,608
Show them the application
so they can arrest these jerks.

754
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:24,779
This is the '80s,
you gotta do something, Mr. Miyagi.

755
00:51:24,862 --> 00:51:27,156
You can't be so damn passive.

756
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:30,786
Somebody's gotta do something
about these guys.

757
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:49,852
I bring the tournament application
to the police station.

758
00:51:49,936 --> 00:51:51,855
As I walk in, they start laughing at me.

759
00:51:51,939 --> 00:51:54,692
Finally the sergeant said,
"Son, we'll look into it."

760
00:51:54,776 --> 00:51:56,319
We'll see. I hope.

761
00:51:57,696 --> 00:52:01,243
I still think you should ask Mr. Miyagi
before going after his tree.

762
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:04,080
He wouldn't have hidden it
in the middle of nowhere...

763
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:07,251
...if he wanted people to dig it up.
- I don't have a choice.

764
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:09,753
If he doesn't sell this tree
we're looking for...

765
00:52:09,837 --> 00:52:11,589
...he loses his business. He's broke.

766
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:14,844
His social security can barely cover
the expenses on his rowboat.

767
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:17,180
This tree is like money in the bank.

768
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:19,516
Great. So now we're robbing a bank.

769
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:28,737
How much do you think
this thing is worth?

770
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:33,410
<i>I found out these original bonsai trees
start at $10,000.</i>

771
00:52:33,493 --> 00:52:36,622
- Seriously?
- See, that's why it is so important to me.

772
00:52:36,748 --> 00:52:41,420
This one tree can set Mr. Miyagi up for life.
That's the least I could do for him.

773
00:52:44,424 --> 00:52:46,260
It's a long way down there.

774
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,265
- You know what I think?
- What?

775
00:52:50,348 --> 00:52:55,439
I think when the tide comes in,
the ocean fills up the bottom down there.

776
00:52:55,689 --> 00:52:58,025
Yeah, Mr. Miyagi sure knows
how to pick 'em.

777
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,861
Yeah, no kidding.

778
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:04,158
How are we supposed to find
Mr. Miyagi's tiny little tree in all this?

779
00:53:04,241 --> 00:53:08,080
He told me he put it halfway down
the steepest cliff...

780
00:53:08,163 --> 00:53:10,708
...where it would catch
the first rays of the sun.

781
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:12,711
Good luck. We're never gonna find it.

782
00:53:12,795 --> 00:53:15,423
- Wait! That must be it! I found it!
- Are you sure?

783
00:53:15,507 --> 00:53:18,469
<i>God, it's beautiful.
It's like the one on the back of my gi.</i>

784
00:53:18,552 --> 00:53:20,096
Come on, let me see.

785
00:53:20,179 --> 00:53:22,974
You see that ridge, where the sun hits...

786
00:53:23,058 --> 00:53:25,436
It's just like the one on the pot I made.

787
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,730
How are we going to get
all the way down there?

788
00:53:27,815 --> 00:53:32,112
You leave that to me. I'll teach you.
Come on. We gotta go get the ropes.

789
00:53:34,155 --> 00:53:37,744
- You sure you understand everything?
- Yeah, I got it.

790
00:53:37,828 --> 00:53:41,791
I feed this through here
and I hold this back here and I pray to God.

791
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:47,507
Okay. Now, are you sure
you want to do this?

792
00:53:47,799 --> 00:53:49,175
I wanna do this?

793
00:53:49,384 --> 00:53:52,847
- I gotta do it. I'll be okay.
- You got it. You'll be fine.

794
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,892
Remember, the rope is your friend.
Everything will be great.

795
00:53:55,976 --> 00:53:58,271
Friend? This rope's more than my friend.

796
00:53:58,354 --> 00:54:01,733
I love this rope.
This rope and I are going steady.

797
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:04,529
Right, rope? Just you and me, rope.

798
00:54:06,531 --> 00:54:09,410
Just lean. Okay, you got it. Don't worry.

799
00:54:09,493 --> 00:54:12,164
Just sit back. Just lean back. You got it.

800
00:54:12,956 --> 00:54:14,208
This is almost fun.

801
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:17,212
I'm coming, okay? Just keep going.

802
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,716
This isn't so hard.
You're a pretty good teacher.

803
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:21,009
Thanks.

804
00:54:21,134 --> 00:54:23,763
Daniel! Look out! I got you, okay?

805
00:54:23,846 --> 00:54:27,768
- I'm coming! Daniel, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

806
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:30,563
Hold on! Don't move, I'm coming.
Stay there.

807
00:54:30,688 --> 00:54:34,109
Okay, I got you. I got you.
Put both hands on the rope.

808
00:54:34,193 --> 00:54:38,281
Put your feet against the rocks
and push out. I got you.

809
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:42,788
Push out! There you go!
All right, I got you.

810
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:46,209
Okay, now guide your rope.
Slide your hands to the brake.

811
00:54:46,292 --> 00:54:49,379
To the brake. Right here. All right?

812
00:54:50,214 --> 00:54:53,551
You okay?
Listen, I'm so sorry about the rock.

813
00:54:53,635 --> 00:54:56,722
- You sure you're okay?
- No, I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

814
00:54:56,806 --> 00:54:59,559
God, it's a lot steeper
than it looks from up there, huh?

815
00:54:59,643 --> 00:55:04,315
- You've done this kinda stuff before, right?
- Yeah, but not from this high up.

816
00:55:05,442 --> 00:55:06,568
Great!

817
00:55:06,652 --> 00:55:08,863
Maybe we should go back.
Do you want to?

818
00:55:08,988 --> 00:55:11,199
No, I gotta keep going.
I don't have a choice.

819
00:55:11,282 --> 00:55:15,330
Well, just be careful, okay?
Watch your footing, there you go.

820
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:18,000
All right. God, you scared me.

821
00:55:18,084 --> 00:55:19,585
I scared you?

822
00:55:20,211 --> 00:55:22,923
- You can get killed doing this.
- Just think positive.

823
00:55:23,006 --> 00:55:26,052
- How are we going to get back up there?
- Don't worry about it.

824
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:28,764
You're right. I got enough to worry about.

825
00:55:31,184 --> 00:55:33,603
- What?
- Where's the tree?

826
00:55:33,687 --> 00:55:36,190
It's right there, between the two ropes.

827
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:37,901
Come on.

828
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:51,169
It's a beautiful tree.

829
00:55:54,339 --> 00:55:58,136
Mr. Miyagi must have looked like
Spider-Man coming down here, huh?

830
00:55:58,219 --> 00:55:59,679
Yeah, no kidding.

831
00:55:59,762 --> 00:56:01,807
Now, remember how I told you to lock off.

832
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,186
Take the rope
and you put it around your butt.

833
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:06,606
And you tie it around your leg.
Okay, get it?

834
00:56:06,689 --> 00:56:09,693
- There you go. I got it!
- There you go. You got it.

835
00:56:09,818 --> 00:56:12,488
- All right.
- Now you can use both your hands.

836
00:56:13,448 --> 00:56:14,824
All right.

837
00:56:19,831 --> 00:56:22,292
So he really planted this here, huh?

838
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:26,089
What, this tree? He brought this
all the way back from Okinawa.

839
00:56:27,508 --> 00:56:31,054
What if he tells you to put it back?

840
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,890
What if he does?

841
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:36,520
He's not going to tell me to put it back.
Believe me, I know this guy.

842
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:38,480
<i>That bonsai shop
was his dream come true.</i>

843
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:42,361
- He won't have me put it back.
- I don't think we should be doing this.

844
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:46,449
I saw his face when he lost his job.
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

845
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:49,078
But what about the tree?
Isn't it going to die?

846
00:56:49,161 --> 00:56:53,041
The tree will be fine. The most important
thing is to pack the roots well.

847
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:56,212
Believe me, he's taught me everything
about these trees.

848
00:56:56,295 --> 00:56:59,299
- Do you want me to take this for you?
- No, I got it.

849
00:56:59,383 --> 00:57:01,886
All I need is a bag to pack the roots in.

850
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:04,055
- Daniel! Help me up!
- Hang on!

851
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:06,976
Don't let go! Grab the rope!
Are you okay?

852
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:08,436
I got it!

853
00:57:08,603 --> 00:57:11,691
Oh, my God! The tree's in the water!
I gotta get it!

854
00:57:13,651 --> 00:57:15,779
It's gonna get washed out!

855
00:57:15,863 --> 00:57:17,573
Move! Hurry up!

856
00:57:17,824 --> 00:57:19,617
Get out of the way!

857
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,621
I gotta get it!
It's gonna get washed out!

858
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:25,500
The rope! Hurry!
Get the canteen, quick!

859
00:57:25,834 --> 00:57:28,963
We gotta wash the roots off.
The salt water will kill them!

860
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:31,717
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Mr. Miyagi will know what to do.

861
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,762
- Just move it!
- I got the canteen. It's ready.

862
00:57:34,846 --> 00:57:37,850
We gotta get out of here!
The tide's coming in!

863
00:57:37,933 --> 00:57:40,019
Wash the roots off. Be careful.

864
00:57:40,311 --> 00:57:42,147
All right, let me have it.

865
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:44,817
- It's soaked.
- You did good. Put it right in there.

866
00:57:44,901 --> 00:57:47,488
Little fella,
I'll have you home in no time.

867
00:57:47,571 --> 00:57:49,198
No big breaks. We're in good shape.

868
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:51,493
- I just should have tied off better.
- It's not your fault.

869
00:57:51,576 --> 00:57:52,619
Look, it was my idea to...

870
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:55,789
The ropes.

871
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,172
LaRusso! How you doing?

872
00:58:01,339 --> 00:58:02,840
Heads up, Danny-boy.

873
00:58:02,924 --> 00:58:04,593
Here's something you forgot.

874
00:58:04,676 --> 00:58:06,846
How'd they get here?

875
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:10,726
- Hey, this isn't a joke anymore.
- I know.

876
00:58:10,935 --> 00:58:12,436
So let the ropes down.

877
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:12,728
First sign the application.

878
00:58:12,771 --> 00:58:14,731
First sign the application.

879
00:58:15,023 --> 00:58:16,609
Screw you, man!

880
00:58:17,276 --> 00:58:19,738
See, I think you got it backwards,
buddy-boy.

881
00:58:19,822 --> 00:58:22,115
I'm not the one who's screwed here.

882
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:26,497
Now I figure the tide's gonna come
in about 12 minutes.

883
00:58:27,498 --> 00:58:29,125
Hope you brought a life raft.

884
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:31,753
How do we get out of here without a rope?

885
00:58:32,087 --> 00:58:36,218
- Without a rope, we're dead.
- We're dead. Yeah, well, this guy's dead.

886
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:40,598
You're dead. You want me to sign it?
Fine, I'll sign it.

887
00:58:40,682 --> 00:58:43,394
We'll get in the ring
and we'll see who's laughing then.

888
00:58:43,477 --> 00:58:45,897
We'll see who's smiling.
You're gonna be dead meat.

889
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,357
I hate this guy.

890
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,694
Here. I signed it.

891
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:52,489
You want it? You work for it.
You pull us up!

892
00:58:52,906 --> 00:58:55,159
All right! We'll send them down.

893
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:57,662
Let them go.

894
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:01,626
I never learn.

895
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:05,214
I should have just signed
the damn thing in the first place.

896
00:59:05,298 --> 00:59:07,592
I should have signed it
and gotten it over with.

897
00:59:07,675 --> 00:59:09,511
You didn't know this would happen.

898
00:59:09,595 --> 00:59:11,598
With this guy, I should have known.

899
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:14,017
I should have known with that guy.

900
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,104
I should have just signed the damn thing.

901
00:59:17,188 --> 00:59:19,858
We wouldn't be stuck down here.
The tree would be safe.

902
00:59:19,941 --> 00:59:23,529
I'm just such a jackass.
Come on, get us out of here!

903
00:59:23,779 --> 00:59:25,324
Come on, pull!

904
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:43,806
All right, I got you.

905
00:59:49,355 --> 00:59:51,691
You're one heavy wimp, Daniel.

906
00:59:53,194 --> 00:59:55,488
Come on, don't stop. Keep pulling!

907
00:59:55,571 --> 00:59:57,908
- What are you doing?
- Pull us up.

908
00:59:58,033 --> 01:00:00,119
Leave him there. Get the application.

909
01:00:00,203 --> 01:00:02,957
No, you get the application
when I get up there.

910
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:07,295
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

911
01:00:07,379 --> 01:00:09,089
All right, here. Just hold us.

912
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:10,925
- Go get it.
- Here, take it.

913
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:14,972
Check it out.

914
01:00:15,932 --> 01:00:17,308
It's cool.

915
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:18,768
That's it.

916
01:00:18,893 --> 01:00:21,480
Don't even think about backing out, man...

917
01:00:21,564 --> 01:00:23,441
...because then I'll really be pissed.

918
01:00:23,525 --> 01:00:26,153
And this, well,
this'll all seem like a happy memory...

919
01:00:26,237 --> 01:00:28,197
...compared to what I'd do to you.

920
01:00:28,281 --> 01:00:30,200
And what we'd all do to her.

921
01:00:30,325 --> 01:00:31,827
Now you're talking.

922
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,916
- Hey!
- Come on! Pull us up!

923
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,501
What, Tarzan?

924
01:00:37,751 --> 01:00:38,920
Pull us up!

925
01:00:39,212 --> 01:00:41,757
- What will you give me?
- I gave you the application.

926
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:43,718
Yeah, the stakes just went up.

927
01:00:43,801 --> 01:00:45,846
- Give me the tree.
- Daniel, don't!

928
01:00:45,929 --> 01:00:47,723
- No!
- Shut up!

929
01:00:48,308 --> 01:00:49,684
All right.

930
01:00:51,102 --> 01:00:53,063
Just hold us. Don't let go.

931
01:00:56,067 --> 01:00:58,821
Here. Now please be careful with it.

932
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,781
- Please, be careful.
- I will be.

933
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:04,203
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I'm gonna plant it down there!

934
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:06,289
- No!
- No, don't, please.

935
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:08,876
All right, enough. Give me it.

936
01:01:08,959 --> 01:01:11,129
- You want it?
- Just don't throw it over.

937
01:01:11,213 --> 01:01:13,131
Be careful with it, please.

938
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:14,508
Daniel...

939
01:01:15,343 --> 01:01:16,928
...make a wish.

940
01:01:17,178 --> 01:01:18,263
No!

941
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:35,577
Mr. Miyagi?

942
01:01:38,998 --> 01:01:40,125
<i>Daniel-san.</i>

943
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:42,544
The trunk's split. See?

944
01:01:43,087 --> 01:01:47,593
I put the roots in peat moss,
but they got salt water on them...

945
01:01:47,843 --> 01:01:49,011
...and I washed it.

946
01:01:49,095 --> 01:01:52,266
Will you be able to save it?
I didn't mean for this to happen.

947
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:53,393
I'm sorry.

948
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,770
I just figured maybe we could sell it...

949
01:01:55,853 --> 01:01:57,439
...so we wouldn't have to close.

950
01:01:57,523 --> 01:02:00,443
I didn't want it to be my fault
your dream didn't come true.

951
01:02:00,527 --> 01:02:02,320
Whoever bought it would take good care.

952
01:02:02,404 --> 01:02:03,948
Even better care than yourself.

953
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,410
- Tape. A wide one.
- That's so stupid.

954
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:09,539
How can someone take care of it
better than where you left it?

955
01:02:09,622 --> 01:02:12,376
- I didn't mean for this to happen.
- Hold.

956
01:02:12,459 --> 01:02:16,381
- I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
- Miyagi forgive you.

957
01:02:16,506 --> 01:02:18,675
You do? I'm such an idiot.

958
01:02:19,176 --> 01:02:22,097
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Depends.

959
01:02:22,306 --> 01:02:24,641
If roots strong, tree survive.

960
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,853
<i>Where do you want these bonsai trees?</i>

961
01:02:26,936 --> 01:02:28,981
Over there on rack, okay. Thank you.

962
01:02:29,064 --> 01:02:31,066
- Trees?
- Peat moss.

963
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:33,778
Trees? What? What did you do?

964
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:35,823
Did you buy these?

965
01:02:36,198 --> 01:02:37,575
With what?

966
01:02:38,368 --> 01:02:39,786
Sell truck.

967
01:02:40,287 --> 01:02:42,040
You sold the truck?

968
01:02:45,252 --> 01:02:48,506
Well, why didn't you tell me
that's what you were going to do?

969
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:50,675
I wake up this morning, you gone.

970
01:02:51,344 --> 01:02:52,595
Damn it!

971
01:02:52,678 --> 01:02:54,473
Why am I so stupid?

972
01:02:55,682 --> 01:02:57,559
<i>No worry, Daniel-san.</i>

973
01:02:58,061 --> 01:03:01,398
Everything work out.
Everything okay now.

974
01:03:01,482 --> 01:03:04,319
Mr. Miyagi,
I signed to fight in the tournament.

975
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,455
Why?

976
01:03:13,538 --> 01:03:16,251
I don't know why.
Because I'm not you, that's why.

977
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,087
I don't always have the right answers.

978
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,423
We were at the bottom.
They pulled the ropes up.

979
01:03:20,507 --> 01:03:21,841
I made a decision on the spot.

980
01:03:21,925 --> 01:03:25,179
It was the wrong one.
What else was I supposed to do?

981
01:03:25,263 --> 01:03:26,681
Understand.

982
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:28,433
You do?

983
01:03:29,977 --> 01:03:32,272
Listen, Mr. Miyagi,
I gotta be honest with you.

984
01:03:32,355 --> 01:03:35,317
I don't stand a chance against this guy
unless you train me.

985
01:03:35,401 --> 01:03:36,443
Understand.

986
01:03:36,527 --> 01:03:39,030
Well then, you'll train me, right?

987
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:43,078
<i>Daniel-san, Miyagi always train you.</i>

988
01:03:44,746 --> 01:03:47,000
But for tournament, cannot.

989
01:03:49,294 --> 01:03:50,587
Cannot?

990
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:53,800
Cannot? What?
What do you mean, cannot?

991
01:03:53,883 --> 01:03:56,345
Mr. Miyagi, why not?

992
01:04:05,566 --> 01:04:07,693
You know what the worst thing was:

993
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:10,739
When he told me he wouldn't train me
for the tournament.

994
01:04:10,823 --> 01:04:12,951
- Then I knew I was dead.
- What a drag.

995
01:04:13,034 --> 01:04:15,371
Great, let me get some water.
I'm dying of thirst.

996
01:04:15,454 --> 01:04:17,706
- You can't swallow.
- I won't.

997
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:21,002
You can't keep stopping like this.
You gotta build up your wind.

998
01:04:21,086 --> 01:04:23,256
So bonehead can knock more out of me?

999
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:25,634
You gotta have more confidence.

1000
01:04:25,717 --> 01:04:29,305
- Remember you are the champion.
- Yeah, I'd like to forget it.

1001
01:04:33,185 --> 01:04:34,729
Jessica, this is...

1002
01:04:35,021 --> 01:04:36,189
Hi, there.

1003
01:04:36,314 --> 01:04:38,276
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Terry Silver.

1004
01:04:38,359 --> 01:04:40,445
Terry Silver, this is Jessica Andrews.

1005
01:04:40,528 --> 01:04:43,323
- You training for the Olympics?
- No, it's a tournament.

1006
01:04:43,407 --> 01:04:45,743
The one you won last year?
What's it called?

1007
01:04:45,827 --> 01:04:46,911
The All Valley.

1008
01:04:46,995 --> 01:04:49,957
Right. Good for you.
A champion should defend his title.

1009
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,210
John Kreese told me you had a lot of heart.

1010
01:04:52,294 --> 01:04:54,505
Listen, do you know how to front sweep?

1011
01:04:54,797 --> 01:04:56,132
- Not really.
- Learn.

1012
01:04:56,215 --> 01:04:58,969
Most tournament guys
are suckers for the front sweep.

1013
01:04:59,052 --> 01:05:02,515
You can catch them every time.
Ask your Mr. Miyagi. He'll show you.

1014
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:05,394
I'm kind of training for this one myself.

1015
01:05:06,187 --> 01:05:07,772
That's too bad.

1016
01:05:07,856 --> 01:05:11,402
I got a good book on sweep techniques.
I'll drop it off for you sometime.

1017
01:05:11,486 --> 01:05:12,653
Great.

1018
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:15,616
Nice to meet you, Jessica.
Take care of our champion.

1019
01:05:15,699 --> 01:05:17,827
All right, I will. 'Bye.

1020
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:22,625
That was a nice offer about the book.
Come on, you ready?

1021
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:24,544
- Let's go. Yes.
- No, I'm pooped.

1022
01:05:24,628 --> 01:05:27,673
- All right, here I come.
- Come on. You're gorgeous. Hurry.

1023
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,469
- Okay, I'm running.
- You gotta get some muscle.

1024
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:32,012
Oh, man.

1025
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:41,525
Get out of here! I signed it!

1026
01:05:41,608 --> 01:05:44,237
- Why'd you call the cops?
- Why'd you steal the trees?

1027
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,656
You have no proof.

1028
01:05:45,739 --> 01:05:48,325
Who left the application, the tooth fairy?

1029
01:05:49,202 --> 01:05:50,703
It's your ass, man!

1030
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:56,878
There's nothing you've got
that I can't counter.

1031
01:05:56,962 --> 01:05:59,841
- Your karate's a joke.
- Let him up, punk!

1032
01:06:00,174 --> 01:06:02,261
- Who are you, his mother?
- Maybe.

1033
01:06:05,098 --> 01:06:06,683
Get up! Get up!

1034
01:06:07,892 --> 01:06:10,104
You see this? You see it?

1035
01:06:12,983 --> 01:06:15,153
Get your hands off me!

1036
01:06:15,236 --> 01:06:17,864
If I see you even on the same street
as this kid...

1037
01:06:17,947 --> 01:06:20,075
...I won't be so charitable with your health.

1038
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:22,412
- Understand?
- Yes!

1039
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:25,541
Get the hell out of here.

1040
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:26,959
Who is that guy?

1041
01:06:27,042 --> 01:06:29,671
- That's the lunatic who wants my title.
- Come on.

1042
01:06:29,754 --> 01:06:33,176
- I was hoping you would kill him.
- That's not what karate's about.

1043
01:06:33,259 --> 01:06:35,179
- It's for defence.
- I know, you're right.

1044
01:06:35,262 --> 01:06:37,724
- Here's your book.
- I brought that for you.

1045
01:06:37,807 --> 01:06:39,350
Right. Thanks.

1046
01:06:39,434 --> 01:06:41,937
There's only so much
you can learn from a book.

1047
01:06:42,021 --> 01:06:43,522
You're telling me.

1048
01:06:43,731 --> 01:06:46,651
Come on, stand up.
Let me show you a couple of moves.

1049
01:06:46,735 --> 01:06:50,491
Help you deal with punks like that.
Make a strong stance.

1050
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:54,078
Back leg up a little more.
Okay, now sweep me.

1051
01:06:54,162 --> 01:06:58,250
- Well, what do you mean, like that?
- I'm not made of glass. Do it right.

1052
01:07:00,128 --> 01:07:01,213
Better.

1053
01:07:01,296 --> 01:07:04,217
Now a little higher
and at the end twist your hip.

1054
01:07:04,592 --> 01:07:06,344
Keep your hand up.

1055
01:07:09,849 --> 01:07:11,059
Are you okay?

1056
01:07:11,184 --> 01:07:13,646
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.
- That's good.

1057
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:15,606
That's a strong move.

1058
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:18,276
Everyone needs a teacher, Daniel.

1059
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,864
<i>I'm opening the Cobra Kai dojo again.
It's time to set things straight.</i>

1060
01:07:21,948 --> 01:07:26,037
Anytime you want to train,
I'll be there for you. No strings attached.

1061
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:30,876
Thanks. I appreciate that, but...
Listen, thanks for helping me out.

1062
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:34,464
It's my pleasure.
All right, I'll see you around.

1063
01:07:34,548 --> 01:07:36,008
I'll see you.

1064
01:07:39,137 --> 01:07:40,639
Thanks again.

1065
01:07:53,197 --> 01:07:54,949
- Hi, Jessica.
- Hi, Daniel.

1066
01:07:55,032 --> 01:07:56,451
Hey. Mr. Miyagi.

1067
01:07:57,035 --> 01:07:59,747
Listen, I have a favour to ask of you.

1068
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:06,631
- Look, Jessica make. Beautiful. You like?
- I stayed up all night firing them.

1069
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:10,678
I saw one the other night. They're great.
Listen, I have a favour to ask of you.

1070
01:08:10,761 --> 01:08:13,599
I just want to ask you,
do you know how to sweep?

1071
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:15,435
Of course.

1072
01:08:15,518 --> 01:08:18,439
Would you mind showing me?
I'm not asking you to train me.

1073
01:08:18,522 --> 01:08:20,524
I don't want you to train me. One thing.

1074
01:08:20,608 --> 01:08:23,737
I'd be so appreciative.
All you have to give me is one thing.

1075
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:27,826
That's it. Please, you gotta do it. Be a pal.

1076
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:30,287
You wait here. I be right back.

1077
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:32,415
Where you going?

1078
01:08:32,999 --> 01:08:34,585
Just wait here.

1079
01:08:35,586 --> 01:08:38,840
This is great.
Mr. Miyagi will teach me front sweeps.

1080
01:08:38,924 --> 01:08:42,803
I found out from this guy, tournament guys
are suckers for front sweeps.

1081
01:08:42,887 --> 01:08:45,182
- Really?
- I mean, if I get that down, man, I'm...

1082
01:08:45,265 --> 01:08:49,354
<i>Daniel-san, you hold like this.
First, left sweep...</i>

1083
01:08:49,562 --> 01:08:51,065
It's no joke, all right?

1084
01:08:51,148 --> 01:08:53,818
You don't want to show me,
you don't show me.

1085
01:08:53,944 --> 01:08:56,655
Just don't make fun of me, all right?

1086
01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:01,328
I'm sorry for asking.
Don't worry. It won't happen again.

1087
01:09:50,392 --> 01:09:52,604
- Hey.
- Hi, that was great, man.

1088
01:09:52,687 --> 01:09:54,480
- How you doing?
- Good.

1089
01:09:54,564 --> 01:09:58,445
- Just trying to work the rust out.
- Listen, I gave your offer some thought.

1090
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,529
And?

1091
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:02,575
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to take you up on it.

1092
01:10:02,658 --> 01:10:05,037
I mean,
you know, just on a short-term basis.

1093
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,041
Trouble, are you kidding?
lt'd be an honour.

1094
01:10:08,124 --> 01:10:10,668
How does Mr. Miyagi feel about it?

1095
01:10:12,171 --> 01:10:13,923
Well, Mr. Miyagi...

1096
01:10:16,218 --> 01:10:19,055
...doesn't need to know about it, if...

1097
01:10:20,097 --> 01:10:22,893
- But he knows you're competing?
- He knows that.

1098
01:10:22,976 --> 01:10:24,812
He just doesn't approve.

1099
01:10:27,106 --> 01:10:29,526
Everybody has a right to his opinion.

1100
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:32,530
- Look, I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

1101
01:10:32,614 --> 01:10:34,700
So, when do you want to start?

1102
01:10:34,784 --> 01:10:37,788
No, I mean, that's up to you.
Whenever it's...

1103
01:10:37,871 --> 01:10:40,583
<i>I got a gi hanging in the closet.
I think it'll fit.</i>

1104
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:42,835
What do you say we go right now?

1105
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:44,046
Now?

1106
01:10:44,797 --> 01:10:45,839
One more.

1107
01:10:47,968 --> 01:10:50,763
Good. Catch your breath.
Come on over here.

1108
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:53,140
You're better than I thought.

1109
01:10:53,392 --> 01:10:56,061
You're ready to move on, Mr. LaRusso.

1110
01:10:56,144 --> 01:10:57,897
You're ready to move on.

1111
01:10:57,981 --> 01:11:00,568
There are three things
that make a champion.

1112
01:11:00,651 --> 01:11:05,073
The three "D"s:
Desire, devotion and discipline.

1113
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,993
The first two I can't give you.

1114
01:11:07,076 --> 01:11:10,122
The last one I can,
but you have to be willing to receive it.

1115
01:11:10,205 --> 01:11:12,040
Are you, Mr. LaRusso?

1116
01:11:12,666 --> 01:11:13,960
Sure.

1117
01:11:15,086 --> 01:11:17,548
The response you're looking for is,
"Yes, sir."

1118
01:11:17,631 --> 01:11:21,011
- Right. Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Stand up straight.

1119
01:11:21,094 --> 01:11:25,684
Now, over the years I've developed
a system of intensive short-term training...

1120
01:11:25,767 --> 01:11:27,769
...for situations just like this.

1121
01:11:27,853 --> 01:11:30,106
It comes in two parts and has three rules.

1122
01:11:30,189 --> 01:11:32,985
- I call it "Quick Silver."
- That's good.

1123
01:11:34,278 --> 01:11:35,822
You like that, huh?

1124
01:11:36,531 --> 01:11:38,158
Rule Number One:

1125
01:11:38,241 --> 01:11:40,786
A man can't stand, he can't fight.

1126
01:11:41,746 --> 01:11:43,123
Repeat it.

1127
01:11:43,624 --> 01:11:45,418
A man can't stand, he can't fight.

1128
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,670
With conviction, Mr. LaRusso.

1129
01:11:47,962 --> 01:11:51,760
- A man can't stand, he can't fight.
- Good. All right.

1130
01:11:52,594 --> 01:11:56,557
Imagine these two-by-fours are legs.
Sweep them.

1131
01:11:58,769 --> 01:12:00,520
What are you...

1132
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,204
That's too low.

1133
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:17,376
Any higher it'd be like hitting the knee.
Right?

1134
01:12:17,669 --> 01:12:20,630
Did you come here
to teach or to be taught?

1135
01:12:29,433 --> 01:12:32,062
We're not sweeping floors here. Harder.

1136
01:12:32,813 --> 01:12:36,109
Come on, put your hip into it.
That's where the power is.

1137
01:12:37,444 --> 01:12:39,196
That's it. Harder.

1138
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:41,992
Harder.

1139
01:12:47,457 --> 01:12:50,586
<i>"Ow" is not an acceptable kiai in this dojo,
Mr. LaRusso.</i>

1140
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:54,341
Isn't this a little bit extreme, sir?
I mean, come on.

1141
01:12:55,301 --> 01:12:58,597
Extreme situations
require extreme measures.

1142
01:13:16,162 --> 01:13:18,873
Now, you come back tomorrow.
We'll start again.

1143
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,089
You did good for your first day.

1144
01:13:27,426 --> 01:13:28,677
Thanks.

1145
01:13:36,104 --> 01:13:38,065
I really appreciate all your help.

1146
01:13:38,148 --> 01:13:40,276
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

1147
01:14:17,617 --> 01:14:19,286
Who is it?

1148
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:25,752
Why don't you come in?

1149
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:30,509
Just catching up on some sit-ups here.

1150
01:14:30,676 --> 01:14:33,805
You know, it's not easy
when you're training yourself.

1151
01:14:33,972 --> 01:14:36,516
What happened foot?

1152
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:39,938
What foot?

1153
01:14:43,443 --> 01:14:45,194
Look at that!

1154
01:14:46,029 --> 01:14:47,489
I don't know.

1155
01:14:48,157 --> 01:14:51,036
Maybe I banged it in my sleep.
I don't remember.

1156
01:14:52,162 --> 01:14:54,957
- What's that?
- You soak foot.

1157
01:14:55,082 --> 01:14:56,877
Be better tomorrow.

1158
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:02,133
- You got a new foot in there for me?
- No. Next best thing. New foot powder.

1159
01:15:06,264 --> 01:15:08,975
Smells like old foot powder.
What's in there?

1160
01:15:09,101 --> 01:15:12,731
Better you don't know. Give me foot.

1161
01:15:18,446 --> 01:15:20,741
- It's hot!
- Hot, hot...

1162
01:15:22,035 --> 01:15:23,328
Good.

1163
01:15:25,831 --> 01:15:29,378
Maybe tomorrow
you remember what happened foot?

1164
01:15:29,461 --> 01:15:31,046
Then you tell Miyagi.

1165
01:15:31,129 --> 01:15:33,508
Tomorrow? No.

1166
01:15:33,591 --> 01:15:37,638
I have so many things to do tomorrow.
Tomorrow, I'm busy.

1167
01:15:39,432 --> 01:15:43,729
Tomorrow is a bad day.
In the morning, I'm supposed to...

1168
01:15:43,813 --> 01:15:47,651
In the afternoon, I'm meeting with
a buddy of mine I haven't seen since...

1169
01:15:47,734 --> 01:15:50,863
...we got back, you know, from Okinawa.

1170
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,957
What am I doing?

1171
01:16:00,751 --> 01:16:02,421
What am I doing?

1172
01:16:33,962 --> 01:16:36,549
Hope confusion end soon.

1173
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:42,598
Miyagi heart empty without you.

1174
01:16:47,396 --> 01:16:52,569
The bruise on your foot is gone.
That's good. You're a fast healer.

1175
01:16:53,696 --> 01:16:55,323
All right, let's go.

1176
01:16:56,075 --> 01:16:58,911
That's a nice move.
Mr. Miyagi teach you that?

1177
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:01,414
- No.
- I didn't think so.

1178
01:17:01,498 --> 01:17:04,794
<i>- What was the last thing he taught you?
- We did kata.</i>

1179
01:17:04,877 --> 01:17:06,672
<i>- Kata?
- Yeah.</i>

1180
01:17:06,797 --> 01:17:10,218
<i>Kata is good for working up a sweat.
It won't win the tournament.</i>

1181
01:17:10,301 --> 01:17:12,429
Come on over here. Hold the bag.

1182
01:17:12,554 --> 01:17:15,600
Rule Number Two
of the "Quick Silver" method:

1183
01:17:15,725 --> 01:17:18,311
A man can't breathe, he can't fight.

1184
01:17:18,688 --> 01:17:20,856
Now, imagine this is the enemy.

1185
01:17:20,981 --> 01:17:23,902
These are his ribs, behind them his lungs.

1186
01:17:27,907 --> 01:17:29,785
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1187
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:31,579
Good. You try it.

1188
01:17:34,624 --> 01:17:36,961
Wait a minute. Let's do it over here.

1189
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:39,381
- Where?
- Right here, his ribs.

1190
01:17:39,506 --> 01:17:41,007
Lay into him.

1191
01:17:47,934 --> 01:17:50,562
Why do I have to do this with this thing?

1192
01:17:51,814 --> 01:17:54,108
Because it's part of the training.

1193
01:17:54,317 --> 01:17:56,987
Because I'm teaching you
techniques you don't have.

1194
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:59,532
Techniques you need
to win the tournament.

1195
01:17:59,615 --> 01:18:02,619
What, do you think you can rely
on that crane crap?

1196
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:05,123
I did pretty well with it last time.

1197
01:18:07,334 --> 01:18:09,962
Wake up and smell the coffee.

1198
01:18:10,464 --> 01:18:12,924
Last time you weren't fighting this.

1199
01:18:16,304 --> 01:18:18,390
You don't get it, do you?

1200
01:18:20,185 --> 01:18:24,398
If you want to lose because of a little pain,
I can't be a part of that.

1201
01:18:24,482 --> 01:18:27,319
I make wimps into winners,
not the other way around.

1202
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:29,488
Christ, I'm wasting my time.

1203
01:20:02,777 --> 01:20:03,945
Yeah?

1204
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:09,994
Damn it! Can you come back later?

1205
01:20:10,078 --> 01:20:12,414
Why are you doing this to yourself?

1206
01:20:12,539 --> 01:20:13,708
Doing what?

1207
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,752
What you doing.

1208
01:20:16,669 --> 01:20:17,922
Because...

1209
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:23,178
...extreme situations
require extreme measures, okay?

1210
01:20:25,056 --> 01:20:27,476
That not sound like you talking.

1211
01:20:29,144 --> 01:20:31,106
It is me talking, all right?

1212
01:20:31,272 --> 01:20:34,318
I'm sorry if you don't like it,
but I got problems...

1213
01:20:34,402 --> 01:20:37,948
...and if you won't be part of the solution,
don't give me a hard time.

1214
01:20:38,031 --> 01:20:39,659
Okay? You got it?

1215
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:15,330
<i>What are you wasting your time
with kata for?</i>

1216
01:21:15,456 --> 01:21:18,167
Didn't I tell you
it's useless in a tournament?

1217
01:21:18,251 --> 01:21:21,087
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir. You're right. I'm sorry.

1218
01:21:21,589 --> 01:21:23,674
All right. Come over here.

1219
01:21:23,758 --> 01:21:27,804
Let's get back to learning something
that can do some real damage.

1220
01:21:28,347 --> 01:21:30,016
Rule Number Three:

1221
01:21:30,183 --> 01:21:32,603
A man can't see, he can't fight.

1222
01:21:33,437 --> 01:21:35,315
If you hit him square in the nose...

1223
01:21:35,398 --> 01:21:38,944
...he'll be blinded by his tears
and choke on his own blood.

1224
01:21:39,236 --> 01:21:40,738
Here's how it works.

1225
01:21:40,863 --> 01:21:44,786
You wait until your man is attacking
and when he's close enough...

1226
01:21:45,578 --> 01:21:48,749
But that would be face contact.
I'd be disqualified.

1227
01:21:48,874 --> 01:21:51,920
- He ran into your fist, not your fault, right?
- Right.

1228
01:21:52,003 --> 01:21:54,965
He can't continue. That means you win.

1229
01:21:56,842 --> 01:21:58,762
- You like that?
- I like that.

1230
01:21:58,845 --> 01:22:00,515
Good. Give it a shot.

1231
01:22:03,559 --> 01:22:06,021
Let's try it over here on your friend.

1232
01:22:08,358 --> 01:22:09,901
Reverse punch.

1233
01:22:12,571 --> 01:22:13,949
Visualise.

1234
01:22:14,074 --> 01:22:16,409
This isn't a bunch of sticks
and pipes anymore.

1235
01:22:16,493 --> 01:22:19,497
This is a living fighting machine
that wants to detach...

1236
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:22,501
...your head from the rest of your body!

1237
01:22:27,633 --> 01:22:29,761
It's blood. So what?

1238
01:22:30,846 --> 01:22:34,267
Make believe it's his.
This guy wants to break you.

1239
01:22:34,517 --> 01:22:38,814
Humiliate you. Stomp you into the ground.
What are you going to do about it?

1240
01:22:38,939 --> 01:22:41,151
- Gonna nail him!
- Then do it.

1241
01:22:45,573 --> 01:22:47,784
- Yes! You did it!
- I did it, man!

1242
01:22:48,368 --> 01:22:49,704
You nailed him!

1243
01:22:50,705 --> 01:22:53,792
- You're ready!
- I'm ready!

1244
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,548
- What new teacher?
- The guy who's been training me.

1245
01:22:58,631 --> 01:23:01,635
You met him. We were jogging
and he pulled up in the car.

1246
01:23:01,719 --> 01:23:03,513
I know who you are talking about.

1247
01:23:03,597 --> 01:23:06,434
He's teaching me stuff
I thought I'd never be able to do.

1248
01:23:06,517 --> 01:23:09,771
- That's what you said about Mr. Miyagi.
- But this guy's different.

1249
01:23:09,855 --> 01:23:12,358
- How do you mean "different"?
- I'll show you sometime.

1250
01:23:12,442 --> 01:23:15,446
- Come on, let's rock 'n' roll.
- All right, let's do it.

1251
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:17,198
What are you looking at?

1252
01:23:17,281 --> 01:23:19,993
What are you doing
looking at other guys like that for?

1253
01:23:20,076 --> 01:23:21,662
I don't play that.

1254
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:23,664
- I got some nerve?
- You got some nerve...

1255
01:23:23,748 --> 01:23:25,459
What about you?

1256
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:28,254
- No, you get...
- Get out of my way, white boy!

1257
01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:08,390
If I don't get something to drink,
I'm gonna die.

1258
01:24:08,473 --> 01:24:10,560
Tell me. I could drink a horse.

1259
01:24:10,685 --> 01:24:14,439
- Mr. Silver, what are you doing here?
- You told me you'd be here, remember?

1260
01:24:14,523 --> 01:24:16,943
- Hold up, sexy lady.
- Who's your friend?

1261
01:24:17,026 --> 01:24:20,281
- I've been watching you and you are hot.
- She's with me, man.

1262
01:24:20,364 --> 01:24:22,283
- Says who?
- Says me.

1263
01:24:22,993 --> 01:24:24,744
I'm taking her home.

1264
01:24:27,874 --> 01:24:31,378
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

1265
01:24:31,461 --> 01:24:32,881
What, are you nuts?

1266
01:24:33,006 --> 01:24:35,968
Come on. We gotta get out of here!

1267
01:24:36,093 --> 01:24:37,511
Up you go.

1268
01:24:37,636 --> 01:24:40,765
- What happened?
- He broke my nose, man.

1269
01:24:40,849 --> 01:24:42,894
Where's that guy with my money?

1270
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:45,354
Get out of the way!

1271
01:24:46,565 --> 01:24:49,652
Man, that was beautiful.
You didn't even think.

1272
01:24:49,736 --> 01:24:51,905
Something got in your way, bang!
Down it went!

1273
01:24:51,989 --> 01:24:53,532
I gotta go back in there.

1274
01:24:53,616 --> 01:24:56,495
- What are you saying?
- I gotta check that guy out.

1275
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:59,290
Technique and killer instinct.
You got it all now, kid.

1276
01:24:59,373 --> 01:25:01,710
- No, I gotta get out of here.
- Where you going?

1277
01:25:01,793 --> 01:25:05,256
What's wrong? You did the right thing.
You had no choice.

1278
01:25:10,513 --> 01:25:11,848
Who is it?

1279
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:13,850
It's me, it's Daniel.

1280
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:21,236
What do you want?

1281
01:25:21,361 --> 01:25:23,029
- Can I talk to you?
- I'm busy.

1282
01:25:23,112 --> 01:25:25,366
Just give me a minute. Please.

1283
01:25:30,622 --> 01:25:33,626
I want to apologise for tonight.
It shouldn't have happened.

1284
01:25:33,709 --> 01:25:36,547
You should tell that to the guy
whose nose you broke.

1285
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:38,591
I am. I will.

1286
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,470
I just didn't want you leaving
thinking that was me.

1287
01:25:41,554 --> 01:25:43,013
It wasn't you?

1288
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:45,725
Then who was it? Conan the Barbarian?

1289
01:25:45,851 --> 01:25:48,938
I've been trying to be someone I'm not
and it's not working.

1290
01:25:49,021 --> 01:25:51,900
I feel like I'm losing control of everything.

1291
01:25:52,192 --> 01:25:55,488
The only thing I see you losing control of
is your temper.

1292
01:25:55,572 --> 01:25:58,367
Well, and your friendship
and Mr. Miyagi's trust.

1293
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,620
I've lost everything.
I don't know what to do.

1294
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:03,123
I've wrecked everything with Mr. Miyagi.

1295
01:26:03,206 --> 01:26:07,171
I know he's written me off.
And I can't blame him. I don't blame him.

1296
01:26:07,337 --> 01:26:09,966
I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.

1297
01:26:21,314 --> 01:26:23,358
Nobody's written you off.

1298
01:26:23,859 --> 01:26:28,573
Just because I got upset
doesn't mean I'm not your friend anymore.

1299
01:26:28,948 --> 01:26:33,038
Mr. Miyagi, he loves you.
He has faith in you. He told me that.

1300
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:37,126
Let's see how much faith he has
when he hears about what I did tonight.

1301
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:41,798
- I think he should hear it from you first.
- It's too late. I blew it. It's blown.

1302
01:26:41,882 --> 01:26:44,636
You're gonna blow,
unless you do something about it now.

1303
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:49,684
I know, you're right. It's easy to say.
It's just, I don't know if I could face him.

1304
01:26:55,317 --> 01:26:57,069
You'll do fine.

1305
01:26:57,653 --> 01:27:00,323
You just gotta do it.

1306
01:27:03,285 --> 01:27:05,956
Well, I don't know if I can.

1307
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:17,220
I'm gonna miss you.

1308
01:27:18,013 --> 01:27:20,474
Send me a Christmas card, okay?

1309
01:27:21,184 --> 01:27:23,270
You got a deal.

1310
01:27:24,062 --> 01:27:25,731
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

1311
01:27:31,698 --> 01:27:32,866
Thanks.

1312
01:27:33,533 --> 01:27:34,827
Anytime.

1313
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,336
I just told the other nurse
that I don't know his name.

1314
01:27:42,461 --> 01:27:45,132
I'm the guy who broke his nose.
I need to talk to him.

1315
01:27:45,215 --> 01:27:48,136
I need to tell him I'm sorry
and that I want to pay for it.

1316
01:27:48,219 --> 01:27:51,015
Please, let me speak with him.

1317
01:27:52,182 --> 01:27:56,731
No, I can't wait until tomorrow, all right.
I gotta talk to him now, damn it!

1318
01:27:56,856 --> 01:28:00,819
All right. I'm sorry, okay?
I don't mean to be rude, I'm...

1319
01:28:01,361 --> 01:28:03,114
Hello, miss?

1320
01:28:08,829 --> 01:28:10,749
Look at this.

1321
01:28:10,832 --> 01:28:14,420
Look at my sweatshirt.
I got some poor guy's blood all over me.

1322
01:28:14,545 --> 01:28:17,049
Everything you taught me,
I did the opposite.

1323
01:28:17,132 --> 01:28:20,178
I couldn't have been worse.
I did everything wrong.

1324
01:28:20,261 --> 01:28:23,641
I just feel like your tree.
You know, the one that I wrecked.

1325
01:28:23,724 --> 01:28:26,478
I feel just like that.
I feel like I'm falling apart.

1326
01:28:26,561 --> 01:28:27,979
Miyagi show you something.

1327
01:28:28,063 --> 01:28:30,691
I feel like the whole world
is coming down on me.

1328
01:28:30,775 --> 01:28:33,654
It's all my fault. I did it myself.

1329
01:28:33,779 --> 01:28:37,242
Everything can heal. Just take time.

1330
01:28:37,325 --> 01:28:38,702
Take patience.

1331
01:28:38,827 --> 01:28:43,792
I'm sorry. When I started out
I never meant for it to end the way it did.

1332
01:28:44,292 --> 01:28:47,463
Sometime when take trip,
better know where trip end.

1333
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,300
Otherwise better just stay home.

1334
01:28:53,137 --> 01:28:55,266
It's budding.

1335
01:28:55,391 --> 01:28:57,851
Look at that, it's gonna make it.

1336
01:28:59,604 --> 01:29:02,358
Make it because have strong root.

1337
01:29:03,484 --> 01:29:05,571
<i>Just like you, Daniel-san.</i>

1338
01:29:06,655 --> 01:29:08,908
Inside you have strong root.

1339
01:29:09,617 --> 01:29:13,622
No need nothing
except what inside you to grow.

1340
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:17,878
Understand?

1341
01:29:21,842 --> 01:29:23,302
I do understand.

1342
01:29:27,391 --> 01:29:29,101
You're right.

1343
01:29:29,727 --> 01:29:33,356
I gotta go. I'll be right back.
I'll just be a little while.

1344
01:29:33,481 --> 01:29:34,734
Where going?

1345
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:38,655
You remember that guy, Terry Silver?
He's the one that's been training me.

1346
01:29:38,739 --> 01:29:41,826
He meant well,
but I want to tell him it's over.

1347
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:46,875
- It not wait for tomorrow?
- I'll feel better if I get it over with now.

1348
01:29:46,958 --> 01:29:48,668
You like Miyagi come help you?

1349
01:29:48,752 --> 01:29:52,798
No, I did it myself.
I'll get out of it myself, all right?

1350
01:29:52,924 --> 01:29:55,218
I'll be back in a little while.

1351
01:30:11,824 --> 01:30:13,034
Hello.

1352
01:30:18,124 --> 01:30:19,626
Mr. Silver?

1353
01:30:28,764 --> 01:30:29,973
Hello?

1354
01:30:32,977 --> 01:30:34,270
Hello?

1355
01:30:36,857 --> 01:30:38,026
Mr. Silver?

1356
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:39,986
Hey.

1357
01:30:41,154 --> 01:30:42,948
- Hi.
- Here you are.

1358
01:30:43,032 --> 01:30:47,454
- Where'd you go?
- I had to go think about some things.

1359
01:30:47,621 --> 01:30:49,248
- And...
- And?

1360
01:30:49,749 --> 01:30:53,128
And I've...
Listen, I've decided not to defend my title.

1361
01:30:53,712 --> 01:30:56,633
I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

1362
01:30:56,758 --> 01:30:59,136
I mean, you've been great. I just...

1363
01:30:59,470 --> 01:31:02,849
You know, when I hit that guy,
that's just not me.

1364
01:31:03,016 --> 01:31:05,853
I just wanted to come here
and tell you in person...

1365
01:31:05,937 --> 01:31:09,066
...'cause I figured after everything,
I owed you at least that.

1366
01:31:09,149 --> 01:31:11,277
You owe me a lot more than that,
Danny-boy.

1367
01:31:11,361 --> 01:31:14,115
I'm sorry.
I thought the lessons were free, but...

1368
01:31:14,198 --> 01:31:16,283
No. Nothing's for free.

1369
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,995
You are going to defend.

1370
01:31:19,412 --> 01:31:21,499
You're getting in that ring.

1371
01:31:21,624 --> 01:31:23,084
Excuse me, Mr. Silver...

1372
01:31:23,167 --> 01:31:26,296
...you can't make me do something
I don't want to do.

1373
01:31:31,554 --> 01:31:32,930
Danny.

1374
01:31:34,266 --> 01:31:37,979
Since you met me, I've made you do things
you didn't want to do.

1375
01:31:38,104 --> 01:31:39,690
What are you talking about?

1376
01:31:39,773 --> 01:31:41,817
- What am I talking about?
- Yeah, what?

1377
01:31:41,942 --> 01:31:44,320
Let's show him what I'm talking about.

1378
01:31:46,907 --> 01:31:49,619
I'm what he's talking about, shithead.

1379
01:31:50,745 --> 01:31:54,041
- We have a simple agenda here.
- You're crazy.

1380
01:31:54,125 --> 01:31:57,838
Either you fight one fight
or fight for the rest of your life.

1381
01:31:57,921 --> 01:31:59,883
- You're sick!
- What's it gonna be?

1382
01:31:59,966 --> 01:32:03,804
I'm not gonna be there.
So just forget about it, all right?

1383
01:32:07,809 --> 01:32:10,938
Let's show Mr. Kreese
how he's going to get his business back.

1384
01:32:11,022 --> 01:32:13,358
- I won't fight.
- You don't have to.

1385
01:32:13,442 --> 01:32:16,237
You can just stand there
and let him kick your ass.

1386
01:32:20,534 --> 01:32:24,080
- Do the crane, Danny-boy!
- You're doing this to yourself, man.

1387
01:32:24,957 --> 01:32:26,793
Yes!

1388
01:32:29,087 --> 01:32:31,716
- You wanna see some more?
- I wanna see a lot more.

1389
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,384
Bring him back.

1390
01:32:34,010 --> 01:32:35,513
You see his face?

1391
01:32:36,013 --> 01:32:38,725
See the trail? I think he peed in his pants!

1392
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:56,039
Well, look who's here. The big war hero.

1393
01:32:59,252 --> 01:33:01,004
What are you waiting for?

1394
01:33:08,722 --> 01:33:10,183
Party time.

1395
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:16,399
We're old friends.

1396
01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:42,642
Come on, little man.

1397
01:33:42,726 --> 01:33:45,270
Let's see how good you really are.

1398
01:34:27,575 --> 01:34:29,787
You think this is the end of it, old man?

1399
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:32,833
<i>I'm going to open Cobra Kai dojos
all over this valley.</i>

1400
01:34:32,916 --> 01:34:35,294
Hell, I might even teach for free.

1401
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:37,923
From now on when people say
karate around here...

1402
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:40,259
...all they'll mean is Cobra Kai karate.

1403
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:43,763
John Kreese's karate.
You won't even be a memory.

1404
01:34:43,847 --> 01:34:46,600
Yes, he will. You won't.

1405
01:34:49,896 --> 01:34:51,941
Now will you train me?

1406
01:34:58,658 --> 01:35:00,703
Now Miyagi train you.

1407
01:35:03,623 --> 01:35:05,750
Come. Waste time here.

1408
01:36:49,511 --> 01:36:51,222
We plant tree here.

1409
01:36:51,848 --> 01:36:53,809
- You take tree.
- All set.

1410
01:36:53,976 --> 01:36:55,978
- Careful.
- I got it.

1411
01:36:56,061 --> 01:36:59,733
Happy to be home, old fella? Yeah, I bet.

1412
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:03,405
Let's get this crummy plastic bag off you.

1413
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:05,574
Put you back where you belong.

1414
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:08,411
There you go.

1415
01:37:08,661 --> 01:37:10,706
Nice comfortable spot.

1416
01:37:10,831 --> 01:37:14,085
<i>- That feel good?
- Good spot, Daniel-san.</i>

1417
01:37:15,462 --> 01:37:18,716
I got just what you need.
A nice cool drink.

1418
01:37:21,303 --> 01:37:24,057
Let some of your old roots soak that up.

1419
01:37:24,515 --> 01:37:28,395
<i>Daniel-san, this bonsai have strong root.</i>

1420
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:30,565
Same you.

1421
01:37:31,399 --> 01:37:34,153
This tree now choose how it grow.

1422
01:37:35,112 --> 01:37:37,532
So must you choose how you grow.

1423
01:37:40,662 --> 01:37:43,290
Miyagi have great faith in you.

1424
01:37:44,583 --> 01:37:46,336
Understand?

1425
01:38:13,162 --> 01:38:15,040
<i>Come on, Daniel-san.</i>

1426
01:38:35,233 --> 01:38:37,361
See you around, old fella.

1427
01:38:51,671 --> 01:38:53,256
<i>Point Barnes!</i>

1428
01:38:53,381 --> 01:38:56,135
<i>The score is 2-0.</i>

1429
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:59,264
- Let's do it up, do it right!
- Ready? Begin!

1430
01:39:01,851 --> 01:39:04,730
- Did you teach him that?
- No, that one is his.

1431
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:08,818
A warning for a kick to the groin.
Once more, costs you a point.

1432
01:39:08,902 --> 01:39:11,656
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1433
01:39:14,451 --> 01:39:16,287
<i>Three points for Barnes.</i>

1434
01:39:16,371 --> 01:39:19,290
- Danny-boy's gonna get murdered up there.
- Winner!

1435
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,210
Face me. Bow.

1436
01:39:21,293 --> 01:39:22,754
Shake hands.

1437
01:39:23,171 --> 01:39:25,298
You're next, LaRusso. I own your ass.

1438
01:39:25,382 --> 01:39:28,135
<i>While we wait for the challenger
to catch his breath...</i>

1439
01:39:28,219 --> 01:39:30,514
T-shirts! Get your Cobra Kai T-shirts!

1440
01:39:30,806 --> 01:39:34,852
<i>... I'd like to thank a new patron of ours
for the purchase and donation...</i>

1441
01:39:34,936 --> 01:39:38,232
<i>... of the permanent home
of the All Valley Championships.</i>

1442
01:39:38,315 --> 01:39:43,781
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the president
of Dyna-tox Industries, Mr. Terry Silver.</i>

1443
01:39:43,864 --> 01:39:45,701
Yeah, Mr. Silver!

1444
01:39:49,038 --> 01:39:50,415
<i>Thank you, John.</i>

1445
01:39:50,832 --> 01:39:52,459
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1446
01:39:52,793 --> 01:39:57,465
<i>I've always lived my life by the rule:
"If you get, you give."</i>

1447
01:39:58,718 --> 01:40:02,014
<i>For the last 20 years,
I've gotten from karate.</i>

1448
01:40:02,723 --> 01:40:04,892
<i>I've gotten discipline...</i>

1449
01:40:05,018 --> 01:40:08,022
<i>... health, self-confidence...</i>

1450
01:40:08,105 --> 01:40:09,690
<i>... inner peace.</i>

1451
01:40:09,857 --> 01:40:12,527
<i>Everything that makes me
what I am today.</i>

1452
01:40:12,861 --> 01:40:16,407
<i>And today, it's time for me to give back.</i>

1453
01:40:19,453 --> 01:40:23,124
<i>It's my pleasure to announce
my partnership with the greatest...</i>

1454
01:40:23,249 --> 01:40:27,296
<i>... karate man I have ever known,
Sensei John Kreese.</i>

1455
01:40:27,464 --> 01:40:29,758
Yeah, Mr. Kreese.

1456
01:40:35,849 --> 01:40:39,646
<i>Together, we are about to open
a chain of Cobra Kai dojos...</i>

1457
01:40:39,812 --> 01:40:44,903
<i>... where young people can come
and learn the same values I've learned:</i>

1458
01:40:46,446 --> 01:40:47,782
<i>Honesty...</i>

1459
01:40:48,699 --> 01:40:50,369
<i>... compassion...</i>

1460
01:40:51,036 --> 01:40:52,788
<i>... and fair play.</i>

1461
01:40:53,414 --> 01:40:57,252
<i>Thank you all for coming.
Enjoy the final match.</i>

1462
01:40:57,753 --> 01:40:59,546
<i>Thank you, Mr. Silver.</i>

1463
01:41:01,925 --> 01:41:06,138
<i>And thank you again
for your most generous contribution.</i>

1464
01:41:06,223 --> 01:41:07,933
Remember the game plan.

1465
01:41:08,058 --> 01:41:10,478
First you win a point,
then you lose a point.

1466
01:41:10,561 --> 01:41:14,316
Keep the score 0-0.
Pulverise him for the full three minutes.

1467
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:17,362
Then in sudden death,
you get the point, we win.

1468
01:41:17,445 --> 01:41:19,699
I want him to experience pain.

1469
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:22,494
- First he suffers.
- Then he suffers some more.

1470
01:41:22,619 --> 01:41:27,166
<i>Representing the Cobra Kai,
the challenger, Mike Barnes.</i>

1471
01:41:30,629 --> 01:41:34,467
<i>And in this corner,
someone who needs no introduction...</i>

1472
01:41:34,551 --> 01:41:37,972
<i>... the defending champion
from the Miyagi dojo...</i>

1473
01:41:38,139 --> 01:41:40,183
<i>... Daniel LaRusso.</i>

1474
01:41:56,330 --> 01:41:58,916
<i>This match will have
a three-minute time limit.</i>

1475
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,422
<i>The first fighter to score three points
will be designated this year's...</i>

1476
01:42:03,547 --> 01:42:06,051
<i>... All Valley Under-18 Champion.</i>

1477
01:42:06,134 --> 01:42:08,763
<i>- Fighters to your marks!
- Go out there and get him.</i>

1478
01:42:08,846 --> 01:42:10,556
Flatten him out, Mike. Fight him!

1479
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:16,064
<i>Remember, folks, the new rule this year
states that if there is no winner...</i>

1480
01:42:16,147 --> 01:42:20,361
<i>... at the end of three minutes
the championship match will go...</i>

1481
01:42:20,444 --> 01:42:22,656
<i>... into sudden-death overtime.</i>

1482
01:42:22,739 --> 01:42:25,076
When it's over,
his mother won't recognise him.

1483
01:42:25,159 --> 01:42:26,285
You both know the rules.

1484
01:42:26,369 --> 01:42:30,123
Light contact is allowed to the body,
and I do mean light, Mr. Barnes.

1485
01:42:30,207 --> 01:42:32,251
No face contact is allowed.

1486
01:42:32,502 --> 01:42:35,589
Any violation of the rules
will result in a penalty point.

1487
01:42:36,674 --> 01:42:37,467
On your lines.

1488
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:39,260
Come on, Daniel!

1489
01:42:40,304 --> 01:42:44,142
Face this way, bow. Face each other, bow.

1490
01:42:44,518 --> 01:42:45,978
I said bow.

1491
01:42:46,938 --> 01:42:49,649
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1492
01:42:53,405 --> 01:42:57,076
Break, break! Let's go.
Out of the ring. No point.

1493
01:42:57,159 --> 01:42:58,369
Begin!

1494
01:43:02,332 --> 01:43:03,876
<i>Point, Barnes.</i>

1495
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,004
<i>Score: 1-0.</i>

1496
01:43:06,088 --> 01:43:07,715
Look over at the slope.

1497
01:43:07,798 --> 01:43:09,342
Is that perfect?

1498
01:43:10,135 --> 01:43:13,305
One point Barnes for the punch.
Fighting positions.

1499
01:43:13,431 --> 01:43:14,807
Begin!

1500
01:43:19,564 --> 01:43:22,901
Danny-boy, how are the family jewels?

1501
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:26,197
Get off the mat! Now! Get off the mat!

1502
01:43:26,281 --> 01:43:28,743
Do that again, Barnes,
and you're disqualified.

1503
01:43:28,826 --> 01:43:33,290
<i>That illegal groin kick
will cost Barnes his previous point.</i>

1504
01:43:33,665 --> 01:43:36,502
<i>Score is now 0-0.</i>

1505
01:43:36,836 --> 01:43:39,048
Kick to the groin. Penalty point.

1506
01:43:39,131 --> 01:43:41,676
- Score is 0-0.
- You're dirty, Barnes.

1507
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,806
- He'll get you 'cause you're dirty.
- Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1508
01:43:54,567 --> 01:43:56,111
That's the one, Mike.

1509
01:43:56,195 --> 01:43:59,199
<i>Barnes scores the point. Reverse punch.</i>

1510
01:43:59,282 --> 01:44:00,700
Go, Daniel!

1511
01:44:01,494 --> 01:44:03,162
Come on, Daniel.

1512
01:44:03,871 --> 01:44:05,624
Let's go, LaRusso.

1513
01:44:07,334 --> 01:44:08,628
Point Barnes.

1514
01:44:08,753 --> 01:44:10,797
Score is 1-0. Ready?

1515
01:44:10,881 --> 01:44:13,008
Come on, Mike, you got him.

1516
01:44:13,175 --> 01:44:14,552
Begin!

1517
01:44:16,137 --> 01:44:18,057
Break, break!

1518
01:44:18,474 --> 01:44:20,017
On your line!

1519
01:44:20,644 --> 01:44:24,023
That's it, Barnes.
One more violation and you're disqualified.

1520
01:44:24,107 --> 01:44:27,236
<i>That illegal punch
will cost Barnes one point.</i>

1521
01:44:27,486 --> 01:44:29,697
<i>The score is again 0-0.</i>

1522
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:31,783
You all right, LaRusso?

1523
01:44:32,909 --> 01:44:35,329
Intentional face contact, penalty point.

1524
01:44:35,413 --> 01:44:37,624
- Perfect.
- Score is 0-0.

1525
01:44:37,958 --> 01:44:39,876
Fighting positions.

1526
01:44:39,961 --> 01:44:41,796
Ready? Begin!

1527
01:44:45,426 --> 01:44:48,054
Now the real pain begins, Danny-boy.

1528
01:44:49,849 --> 01:44:51,142
On your lines.

1529
01:44:52,226 --> 01:44:54,646
That's a warning
for running out of the ring.

1530
01:44:54,730 --> 01:44:56,064
Come on, Barnes!

1531
01:44:58,151 --> 01:45:00,946
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1532
01:45:05,326 --> 01:45:07,538
Break! Break!

1533
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:09,207
On your line.

1534
01:45:09,416 --> 01:45:10,709
He'll get up.

1535
01:45:10,834 --> 01:45:12,712
He's too dumb not to.

1536
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:16,717
LaRusso, on your line.

1537
01:45:17,301 --> 01:45:19,345
Get up, you pansy-ass!

1538
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:24,602
<i>- No point for kick to the back.
- No point scored.</i>

1539
01:45:24,727 --> 01:45:28,941
- This is beautiful. It's beautiful.
- Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1540
01:45:32,237 --> 01:45:33,364
Break!

1541
01:45:35,158 --> 01:45:37,410
What's the matter, you can't breathe?

1542
01:45:37,494 --> 01:45:40,247
- On your line.
- I love it when he pounds him!

1543
01:45:41,457 --> 01:45:44,336
- On your line.
- This is more fun than I thought.

1544
01:45:44,461 --> 01:45:47,090
<i>No clean technique on that exchange.</i>

1545
01:45:47,382 --> 01:45:48,967
<i>No point scored.</i>

1546
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:51,971
<i>The score remains 0-0.</i>

1547
01:45:52,472 --> 01:45:54,642
<i>Ten seconds left in the match.</i>

1548
01:45:54,725 --> 01:45:56,644
- Let's go, Danny.
- Fighting positions.

1549
01:45:56,727 --> 01:45:59,439
- You gotta turn it around.
- Ready? Begin!

1550
01:46:00,649 --> 01:46:01,943
Time!

1551
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:03,986
Break!

1552
01:46:04,738 --> 01:46:07,157
<i>There will be a one-minute rest period.</i>

1553
01:46:07,241 --> 01:46:10,078
<i>Then the match will continue
with sudden death.</i>

1554
01:46:10,161 --> 01:46:13,541
<i>- Daniel-san!
- Mr. Miyagi, it's over.</i>

1555
01:46:13,959 --> 01:46:15,335
- No!
- It's over, forget it.

1556
01:46:15,419 --> 01:46:17,171
- No!
- I'm afraid. Let's go.

1557
01:46:17,255 --> 01:46:18,965
- I want to go home.
- Can't! You must not!

1558
01:46:19,048 --> 01:46:20,801
Is okay to lose to opponent.

1559
01:46:20,884 --> 01:46:24,264
- Must not lose to fear!
- Yeah, well, I'm afraid!

1560
01:46:24,347 --> 01:46:27,977
I'm afraid of him, all right?
What do you want me to do?

1561
01:46:28,853 --> 01:46:30,856
You stay focused.

1562
01:46:32,107 --> 01:46:35,528
<i>Daniel-san,
your best karate is still inside you.</i>

1563
01:46:36,028 --> 01:46:37,740
Now time let out!

1564
01:46:39,909 --> 01:46:42,412
<i>That's the end of the rest period.</i>

1565
01:46:42,495 --> 01:46:45,332
- Fighters on your lines.
- Come on, get up!

1566
01:46:45,458 --> 01:46:47,961
Get on that line!
Get on that line, LaRusso!

1567
01:46:48,044 --> 01:46:50,548
You're worthless!
Your slope teacher's nothing!

1568
01:46:50,631 --> 01:46:53,343
Get up, man!
You're no champion. Get up!

1569
01:46:53,469 --> 01:46:55,929
You suck, LaRusso! You suck, man!

1570
01:46:56,014 --> 01:46:59,100
And your teacher's karate is shit.
You hear me? He's shit!

1571
01:46:59,184 --> 01:47:00,728
You're done, LaRusso.

1572
01:47:00,811 --> 01:47:03,607
Your karate is a joke.
And your teacher's worth shit.

1573
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:09,281
He's nothing! And you're nothing!
I own you! I own you, LaRusso!

1574
01:47:09,406 --> 01:47:12,619
Where's your little Jap teacher now?
He's a phoney, man.

1575
01:47:12,702 --> 01:47:14,621
He's a fake
and he didn't teach you nothing.

1576
01:47:14,704 --> 01:47:16,165
Your karate's shit. You hear me?
Get up!

1577
01:47:18,459 --> 01:47:21,463
Come on, Mike!
This is what we've been waiting for!

1578
01:47:27,096 --> 01:47:28,807
Fighting positions.

1579
01:47:29,099 --> 01:47:30,308
Ready?

1580
01:47:31,434 --> 01:47:32,645
Begin!

1581
01:47:32,937 --> 01:47:35,190
Mike! Take him out!

1582
01:47:40,446 --> 01:47:41,740
Hit him!

1583
01:47:45,245 --> 01:47:47,539
Get the point! Get the point!

1584
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:51,211
Hit him, Mike! He's hallucinating.

1585
01:47:59,721 --> 01:48:01,099
Winner!

1586
01:48:01,182 --> 01:48:06,313
<i>The winner and the first to ever win
two years in a row...</i>

1587
01:48:07,148 --> 01:48:10,360
<i>... the grand champion, Daniel LaRusso. </i>

1588
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:15,284
Mr. Miyagi, forget about it!

1589
01:48:34,726 --> 01:48:37,563
We did it! We did it!

1590
01:48:38,564 --> 01:48:42,564
