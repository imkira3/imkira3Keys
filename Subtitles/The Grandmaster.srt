Wong Kar Wai

21
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,430
Don't tell me how well you fight,

22
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,660
or how great your teacher is,

23
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,030
or brag about your style.

24
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,730
Kung fu: two words.

25
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,240
Horizontal. Vertical.

26
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,000
Make a mistake, horizontal.

27
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,780
Stay standing and you win.

28
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,250
Isn't that right?

29
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,750
Not bad.

30
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,000
A master of Wing Chun.

31
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,380
The new hope of the South.

32
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,210
What's his name?

33
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,840
Ip Man.

34
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,750
We're from Foshan.

35
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,330
My father ran the family business.

36
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,910
He exported goods to Hong Kong.

37
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,340
The Ips are an old Foshan family.

38
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,670
They named a street after us,
that's how wealthy we were.

39
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,800
Before I turned 40, life was easy.

40
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,430
I lived on family money,

41
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,880
and had one passion:

42
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,190
Wing Chun.

43
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,190
My wife, Zhang Yongcheng,

44
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,560
was the descendant
of an Imperial Minister.

45
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,190
She was a woman of few words
because she knew their power.

46
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,570
We understood each other well.

47
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,090
When I went out, she lit a lamp

48
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,630
and left it lit until I came home.

49
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,260
If life has seasons,

50
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,380
my first 40 years were spring.

51
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,610
In 1936, Foshan was a prosperous city.

52
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,480
Life was peaceful and good.

53
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,950
Men socialized in brothels.

54
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,870
Foshan's finest was Republic House.

55
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,830
Its walls were covered in gold,

56
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,950
so we called it the Gold Pavilion.

57
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,910
It was the first to have an elevator.

58
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,040
Enter a prince, exit a pauper.

59
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,590
You'd spend money like water.

60
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,750
It was like a social club
for martial artists.

61
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,500
Good men can be found among rogues...

62
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,680
...and hidden masters, too.

63
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,680
People saw it as a pleasure palace.

64
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,900
But to us, it was a battleground.

65
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,410
I claim three accomplishments in life.

66
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,330
I united Xingyi and Bagua styles.

67
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,270
Second, I became the director
of the Northern Martial Arts Union,

68
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,770
bringing together Tongbei, Cannon Fist,

69
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,220
Tai Chi, Yan Qing, and other schools.

70
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,280
Third, I took
the Northern masters South.

71
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,730
In 1929,

72
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,980
I supervised the founding
of the Southern Martial Arts Academy

73
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,420
after talks here in the Gold Pavilion.

74
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,330
I'm getting old.

75
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,710
It's time for new blood.

76
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,340
I held a retirement ceremony up North.

77
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,670
You invited me
to hold a second one here...

78
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:46,980
...to bid farewell
to my Southern comrades.

79
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,470
Up North, the one who took part

80
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,350
was my top disciple, Ma San.

81
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,600
He'll be my successor.

82
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,240
I hope you'll give him your support.

83
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,700
I'd always wanted

84
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,620
to take the Southern styles North.

85
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,120
Sadly, my time is up.

86
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:21,210
I want to hold a demonstration match

87
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,300
with a Southern martial artist.

88
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,100
Someone you all support.

89
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,150
Pick one.

90
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,070
How could I represent the South?

91
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,410
Among the great Southern schools,

92
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,070
there are many besides Wing Chun.

93
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,660
In rank, you're all senior to me.

94
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,920
You're the leaders and masters.

95
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
I have no standing.

96
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,720
The reputation of the South is at stake.

97
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,090
We Southerners may be petty,

98
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,170
but we don't run away from a fight.

99
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,260
We're not afraid of these Northerners!

100
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,020
This is a challenge.

101
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,560
We will rise to it.
Isn't that right?

102
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,930
Absolutely!

103
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,110
It must be you.

104
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,410
Think you're good enough
to challenge the Grandmaster?

105
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,760
Let's keep it simple.

106
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,060
- I'll take you all on.
- Get him!

107
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,460
Go tell lp
that at the ceremony up North,

108
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,670
I had the honor.

109
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,590
To worship at the feet of the Buddha,

110
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,170
first pass the Guardian of the Gate.

111
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,980
That's me.

112
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,690
Do you know
why a knife must have a sheath?

113
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,700
Its real power lies not in sharpness,

114
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,270
but in concealment.

115
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,990
You're too sharp a blade.

116
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,500
You have to stay put.

117
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,500
My sheath... is you, Master.

118
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,790
With you around, I'm under control.

119
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,380
I can no longer control you.

120
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,620
You're too anxious to make your mark.

121
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,830
For now, leave Foshan.

122
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,140
Miss that train,

123
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,340
and I'll break your legs.

124
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,020
Central News Broadcast."

125
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,030
Mounting anti-Northern sentiment
in the region

126
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,820
has turned the match by the
Northern visitors into a challenge.

127
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,440
The Southern clans have begun
blocking off entrances to Foshan

128
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,940
to prevent hostilities.

129
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,710
Halt!

130
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,540
Let us pass.

131
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Sorry. This street is closed off.

132
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,440
No one bearing arms can enter.

133
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,300
Do you know who's in that rickshaw?

134
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,260
It's Master Gong's daughter!

135
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,530
Miss Gong, it's good you're here.

136
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,650
He must call this off.
Win or lose, it's a disgrace.

137
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,650
In all his years of fighting,
he's never lost.

138
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,290
How dare you?

139
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,380
She's impossible.

140
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,450
Your Northern colleagues
disapprove of this match.

141
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,290
It's a huge honor
that this lp doesn't deserve.

142
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,800
It's not how things are done.

143
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,810
Don't follow the herd.

144
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:39,480
If the old never let go,
when will the young ever get a chance?

145
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,940
Ip Man has talent.

146
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,940
Let's see if he can prove himself.

147
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,350
The Gong Family has never lost before.

148
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,910
With you here,

149
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,940
what can he prove?

150
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,490
I once had a temper like yours.

151
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,250
Winning was everything.

152
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,160
But life's bigger than that.

153
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,960
Take a longer view.

154
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,760
Past the mountains, the world opens up.

155
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,350
Not to see the good in others,

156
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,900
not to admit their talent,

157
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,970
is to lack generosity.

158
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,730
Our high standards in Martial Arts

159
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,740
apply to character as well.

160
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,380
Father.

161
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,650
Why did you bring me to a brothel?

162
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,520
If you don't see something...

163
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,980
...does it not exist?

164
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,610
No harm in seeing.

165
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,120
The first time I came here

166
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,500
was before you were born.

167
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,460
Twenty years have passed in a flash.

168
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,380
In life, ability isn't everything.

169
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,800
Some thrive in light,

170
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,810
others in shadows.

171
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,630
The times make us what we are.

172
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,690
I asked you to come South

173
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,510
to bring things full circle

174
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,990
and to let you see

175
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,490
how I step down.

176
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,240
Since you were little,

177
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,860
you've watched me fight.

178
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,790
This is the last time.

179
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,360
I wish you could've been my successor.

180
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,790
But in the world of Martial Arts,

181
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,840
there's no place for you.

182
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,550
Become a good doctor.

183
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,550
Live a peaceful life.

184
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,750
This is my greatest wish.

185
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,190
Master lp.

186
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,200
You'll be challenging their Grandmaster.

187
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,030
Your big day is coming.

188
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,210
We're here to show our support.

189
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,380
I'm humbled, Uncle Deng.

190
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,590
It's a pleasure.
You're very welcome.

191
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,010
Please.

192
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,900
The ladies and staff congratulate you.

193
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,270
That's quite a battle formation.

194
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,540
Sister San heads
our Peking Opera troupe.

195
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,290
She dabbles in Bagua.

196
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,870
She'd like to offer a few pointers.

197
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,830
Please.

198
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,870
- After you.
- Bagua is based on swordplay.

199
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,460
Single reverse palm is a single blade.

200
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,210
Double reverse palm is a double blade.

201
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,710
The feet arc out and in.

202
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,800
There are 64 transformations.

203
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,680
Attack comes out of nowhere.

204
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,120
Sister San, it's just practice.

205
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,470
No need to smash the ancestral tablets.

206
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,430
I've done that many times before.
No big deal.

207
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,050
Mr. lp, Bagua is underhanded.

208
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,090
Beware.

209
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,350
Thank you.

210
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,860
Ah, Mr lp.

211
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,740
Today is a happy day.

212
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,750
We in Accounts wish you well.

213
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,260
Xingyi began with General Yue Fei.

214
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,420
It uses the fist as a spear.

215
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,630
Drill!

216
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,430
Chop!

217
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,710
Cross!

218
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,890
Blast!

219
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,840
Crush!

220
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,150
Such sensitivity. Impressive!

221
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,930
That Crushing Fist is quite something.

222
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,650
Mr. lP=

223
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,080
each challenge leads to a higher peak.

224
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,040
Xingyi is brutal.

225
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,620
Don't underestimate it.

226
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,990
Let's see how high the peaks get.

227
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,290
This will be fun.

228
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,420
My turn now, Master lp.

229
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,150
And what have you got for me, Yong?

230
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,190
A string of firecrackers.

231
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,120
That move, isn't that Hung Gar?

232
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,840
I'm a jack of all trades.

233
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,730
- You do mix it up.
- What's wrong with that?

234
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,360
So long as it works.

235
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,900
Their 64 Hands have endless
combinations.

236
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,450
Your Wing Chun is a three-trick pony.

237
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,110
Spade, Pin, Sheath.

238
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,700
- How can it compete?
- Three's enough to take care of you.

239
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
Spade.

240
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,290
Pin.

241
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,220
Sheath.

242
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,050
Yong, your fireworks have fizzled.

243
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,520
What of it? I'm an old man.

244
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,730
Youth trumps skill.

245
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,760
He might be a Grandmaster,
but don't hold back.

246
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,030
You'd better win.

247
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,610
This has been a real privilege.

248
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,600
To victory!

249
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,950
Good luck.

250
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,180
Every generation produces new talent.

251
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,890
Mr. lp, we were fated to meet.

252
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,570
For my final contest,

253
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,990
I suggest we match wits, not skill.

254
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,200
Do you accept?

255
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,570
As our guest, it's up to you.

256
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:57,220
When our union was
founded 25 years ago...

257
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,850
...a man came from the South

258
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,800
and offered a challenge.

259
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,890
He held out a flat cake
and asked our Master to break it.

260
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,160
Our Master wasn't offended.

261
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,040
He even named the man
our first chairman.

262
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,540
It wasn't because of his kung fu,

263
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,070
but what he said:

264
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,170
Kung fu divides North and South.

265
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,120
Must the country divide as well?

266
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,290
Mr. lP=

267
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,170
can you break this cake in my hand?

268
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,110
A Tai Chi master stopped
a bird from flying

269
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:34,400
by giving it no perch from which to fly.

270
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,480
The Old Master's skill is too great.

271
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,730
Mr. lp is a sparrow in his palm.

272
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,540
I don't think he can do it.

273
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,390
The world is a big place.

274
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,970
Why limit it to North and South?

275
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,380
It holds you back.

276
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,010
To you, this cake is the country.

277
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,010
To me, it's much more.

278
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,640
Break from what you know
and you will know more.

279
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,530
The Southern arts are bigger
than just North and South.

280
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,490
- Would you agree?
- Well said.

281
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,370
All my life, I've been the victor.

282
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,750
My technique has never failed me.

283
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:19,370
I never thought I'd see
the limits of my own vision.

284
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,260
Mr. lP=

285
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,550
today I've made you famous.

286
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,690
In the future,
you'll face challenges at every step.

287
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,310
I hope you'll be like me.

288
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,730
Pass on the torch.

289
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,360
Never give up the faith.

290
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,280
Keep the light burning.

291
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,380
Tonight, following Northern custom,

292
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,130
the winner will host a banquet.

293
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,940
You'll represent me.

294
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,640
Don't worry,
I'll do the right thing.

295
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,320
Let's go!

296
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,370
Miss Gong, you mustn't do this.

297
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,380
The Gongs have never been defeated.

298
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,790
To me, this contest isn't over yet.

299
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,550
Give this to Mr. lp. He'll understand.

300
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:36,100
I have no chance
to be as great as my father.

301
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,770
It wasn't my choice.

302
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,850
But I'll make my mark.

303
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,490
Go.

304
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,900
Of Master Gong's Martial Arts,

305
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,950
Ma San inherited the steel

306
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,030
and his daughter the silk.

307
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,370
She's the sole heir to the 64 Hands.

308
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,500
Her moves are deadly.

309
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:07,720
This isn't just a banquet.

310
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,050
She's here to redeem the family honor.

311
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,670
Don't underrate Gong Er.

312
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,970
The Martial Arts world has four taboos.

313
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,190
Monks, Taoist priests,
women, and children.

314
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,560
Grappling with them is a bad idea.

315
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:25,860
If their 64 Hands are that good,
how could I not accept?

316
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,450
It's said that all encounters
in this world

317
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,870
are a kind of reunion.

318
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,990
And that was how we first met.

319
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,950
She was nothing
I could've ever expected.

320
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,740
Three days ago,

321
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,720
my father sat here.

322
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,750
Tonight,

323
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,710
it's between us.

324
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,340
- Please.
- Pity about the lovely decor.

325
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,510
Kung fu is about precision.

326
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,020
If anything gets broken,
the win is yours.

327
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,120
In those days,

328
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,530
there were many rituals in our world.

329
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,250
A challenger was an honored guest,

330
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:36,790
welcomed with a banquet
and sent off with gifts.

331
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,300
The night Gong Er left Foshan,
I suggested a rematch.

332
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,380
It went your way this time.

333
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,890
Who knows what next time will bring.

334
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,170
Come to the North.

335
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,770
I'll be waiting.

336
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,560
Take care.

337
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:38,630
I dream of seeing the 64 Hands
again in the snow.

338
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,030
I'm waiting. What's keeping you?

339
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,960
Ip.

340
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,850
Does it fit?

341
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,760
Foshan's never this cold.

342
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,430
Better to be ready.

343
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,520
You'll go sooner or later.

344
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,580
Pick a day.

345
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,290
We'll take a family portrait.

346
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,770
In October 1938,
the Japanese invaded Foshan.

347
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,150
Their army took over our home.

348
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,320
If life has four seasons,

349
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,990
we went from spring straight to winter.

350
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,160
I'll be back with dinner.

351
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,540
Help me prosper?

352
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,210
Rescue me from poverty?

353
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,670
I've never been poor in my life.

354
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:21,560
The country is in crisis
and everyone is suffering.

355
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:23,840
To be poor is no big deal.

356
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:30,520
I'd rather starve
than eat Japanese rice.

357
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,610
I won't collaborate.
Enjoy your dinner.

358
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:54,960
They're brand-new.

359
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:58,640
I was going to the Northeast.
But that's impossible now.

360
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:02,810
Sell them and I can feed my family.

361
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,640
Why's there a button missing?

362
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,230
Is there?

363
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,390
Must've dropped off.

364
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,530
I began studying kung fu at age seven.

365
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,730
Before I turned 40,
I was never beaten.

366
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:25,000
When that happened,

367
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,790
it was life that dealt the blows.

368
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,910
In eight years of war,
I lost everything.

369
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,630
Money, friends...

370
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:36,580
China will never die!

371
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,590
Finally, I lost my family.

372
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,760
Ever taught before, Master lp?

373
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:10,100
To teach for a living
is a new experience.

374
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,470
- So why now?
- I'm starting a new life.

375
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,180
You've got your things.
You must be confident.

376
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,680
- Saves running back and forth.
- We've never heard of Wing Chun.

377
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:24,030
- Any special moves?
- Not really.

378
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:27,690
Three basic hands: Spade, Pin, Sheath.

379
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,990
How many forms?

380
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,790
The Concept, The Bridge,

381
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,660
and Darting Fingers.

382
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,540
VVeapons?

383
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,760
Double Knives,
and the Six-and-a-half Point Pole.

384
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,590
- Anything else?
- That's it.

385
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,430
Bone-setting, internal energy,

386
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,420
I don't do any of that.

387
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,210
Street performance, lion dancing,

388
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,480
I won't work like that.

389
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,770
Why not?

390
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,940
Kung fu's not a circus act,

391
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,480
so I won't teach
without a proper school.

392
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,200
Lion dancers jump at firecrackers.

393
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,450
They're always brawling
and showing off,

394
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,820
all for a bit of cash.

395
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,200
It's crude.

396
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:13,500
I'll ask you straight.

397
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,620
Ever been in a real fight?

398
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,830
It's wall-to-wall kung fu schools here.

399
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,500
Fights start over nothing.

400
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,130
Master lp, have you got what it takes?

401
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:27,170
Try me and find out.

402
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:30,510
Fight! Fight!

403
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,420
I've had a few years of training.

404
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,340
Show me your stuff, Master lp.

405
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,230
- Have you had lunch?
- Barbecued pork and rice.

406
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:41,680
I suggest you wait a bit.
It'd be a shame to waste it.

407
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:42,850
Waste it?

408
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,030
Brother Hung, are you OK?

409
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,540
- Where's the tea?
- Tea?

410
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,910
To give to your new master!

411
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:15,890
Is there a hammer?

412
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,030
Master lp,
the boys and I want some lessons.

413
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,200
Eighty cents a head.
Cheap enough.

414
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,870
But call yourself a master,
you'd better deliver the goods.

415
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,420
No snake oil.
How good is your kung fu, anyway?

416
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,140
Lock the gate.

417
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,690
Hey! Little fucker.

418
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,640
Shut the door and it's on for real.

419
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:08,270
You've got two hands and two feet.
How you gonna beat us all?

420
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,150
You're mistaken.

421
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:14,280
I have two hands, but...
Wing Chun has eight kicks.

422
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,660
Never mind your boys.

423
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,240
There's more than enough for you.

424
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,170
More than enough for me?

425
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,060
That one's free.

426
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,020
First kick.

427
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:13,710
Fourth kick.

428
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,190
One more left.

429
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,750
The life of an exile is rarely easy.

430
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,130
It's full of ups and downs.

431
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,330
Some look ahead.

432
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,250
Others live in the past.

433
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,840
In hard times, even a kung fu master
might serve tea.

434
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,180
Back then, the streets were competitive,

435
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:08,650
kung fu masters all around.

436
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,640
Just accepting a stranger's cigarette
could be dangerous.

437
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:23,030
People, they change with the times.

438
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,170
Wear shoes that suit the crossing,
and pants that fit your ass.

439
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:33,300
In Hong Kong,
I can only afford these cigarettes.

440
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:39,470
Back home,
I smoked real Manchurian tobacco.

441
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,050
Now that was smoking.

442
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,720
"Be good, respectful, deferential."

443
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:48,680
"Deferential" is the key.

444
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,430
Let's say I'm smoking.

445
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:55,700
A stranger sits down.

446
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,530
I defer to him: "Have a smoke."

447
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:02,610
Even if he doesn't smoke, he must accept

448
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,320
or he'll make me lose face.

449
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,170
Mr. lP---

450
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,700
...have a smoke.

451
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,670
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

452
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,920
You've got the gift.

453
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:07,840
Twenty years ago,
we could've sparred.

454
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,050
What a shame.

455
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,900
That year,
refugees flooded into Hong Kong.

456
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,400
Among them were many Northern masters.

457
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:27,320
They brought their Martial Arts skills
with them.

458
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:34,000
One was the fabled Baji master, "Razor."

459
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,260
He called himself a barber.

460
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,360
Some said he was once an assassin,

461
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,730
even the Last Emperor's bodyguard.

462
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,950
His blade was swift and untouchable.

463
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,940
But a blade not blocked never sings.

464
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:11,950
And he sought the Music of Steel.

465
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:15,910
How about a game of chess?

466
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,290
It won't cost you much.

467
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,420
I don't throw money away.

468
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:24,220
They say Wing Chun uses knives,

469
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:27,500
and you never strike twice.

470
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,430
Scary.

471
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,810
- Want to see?
- I want to hear it,

472
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,800
this priceless sound.

473
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,570
This razor hasn't seen an equal
for a long time.

474
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,650
Let me try.

475
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,580
What will you use?

476
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,120
Wing Chun has a saying:

477
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,620
You need both master and opponent.

478
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,620
A great master is like a scale,

479
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:28,750
a genuine opponent, a mirror.

480
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,130
A well-matched opponent
is as rare as a good friend.

481
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:35,770
Razor put away his blade.

482
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,360
But he never forgot that music

483
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:43,690
and he gave Baji to Hong Kong.

484
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,440
China closed the border with
Hong Kong later that year.

485
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,250
I was separated from my family.

486
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,070
For the identification photo,

487
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,120
a student lent me a suit
so I'd fit in.

488
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:09,720
I never wore one again.

489
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:14,970
If I couldn't go home,

490
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,970
I'd never fit in, no matter what I wore.

491
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,360
The day I left Foshan...

492
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,950
...I was sure I would be able to return.

493
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:37,940
Never thought it'd be
the last time I saw her.

494
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,920
After that I only had the path ahead.

495
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,080
There was no turning back...

496
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,000
...and no road home.

497
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,610
Having lost track of her for many years,
I finally found Gong Er in Hong Kong.

498
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,770
She was no longer involved
in the Martial Arts world.

499
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:12,910
She had become a doctor,
as her father once wished.

500
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:23,620
Well, sir, what might you want
on this New Year's Eve?

501
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:27,340
Haven't seen you here before.
Where are you from?

502
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,010
You wouldn't know.

503
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,760
I'm here to see the doctor.

504
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,340
The doctor?

505
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:39,460
Must be serious.

506
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:03,790
You don't look too sick.

507
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:07,330
I'd like to see the 64 Hands again.

508
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,460
If you don't mind my saying...

509
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,330
You lost. I won.

510
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,790
Have a seat.

511
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:23,760
If you'd said that at the door,

512
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:28,350
I wouldn't have made it so easy

513
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,860
for you to get in here to see me.

514
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,060
Thank you.

515
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,690
You know,

516
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:44,400
I'd hoped to visit
the Northeast in 1937.

517
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,160
There was a challenge waiting for me.

518
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,700
I had a warm coat made.

519
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,220
But the war stopped me from going.

520
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:59,470
I didn't keep the coat...

521
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:02,920
...just one of its buttons.

522
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:05,550
Call it a memento.

523
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:11,890
The 64 Hands is too important a legacy.

524
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:16,490
Why let it disappear?

525
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:21,480
In centuries of Martial Arts history,

526
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:25,150
so many things have vanished.

527
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,990
Why should the Gong Family arts survive?

528
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,620
Mr. lP=

529
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,870
no art is higher than Heaven,

530
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,620
no gift more solid than Earth.

531
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:43,350
Nothing lasts forever, and that's fine.

532
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,340
I'll keep this button, but...

533
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:52,010
...as for what may and may not be seen,

534
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:54,530
let's not talk about it now.

535
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,840
How could it be?

536
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:30,770
I never expected to see him again...

537
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,570
...especially under such circumstances.

538
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:40,110
Perhaps it's fate.

539
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:42,520
He still cares for you.

540
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,570
Why hesitate?

541
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,910
Your father would approve of him.

542
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:57,800
Miss Gong, the old rules
don't apply here in Hong Kong.

543
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,220
The vow you took,

544
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:06,250
no one has to know.

545
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,480
Heaven would know.

546
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,900
Earth would know.

547
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,940
Father would know.

548
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,230
No arrow can return to its bow.

549
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,020
Others may live without rules.

550
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:25,280
Not me.

551
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,450
Mr. L01

552
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:03,250
do you know what happened
ten years ago?

553
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,820
Do you remember what I taught you?

554
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:08,980
Yes.

555
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:14,530
Never put yourself first, show respect.

556
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:19,530
There's always someone better.

557
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,160
To yield is not to lose.

558
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:25,170
Master, you've taught me

559
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:28,750
to be modest

560
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:29,970
and know my place.

561
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:31,890
I took you in as an orphan.

562
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:38,770
You brought credit to our school.

563
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,510
Let's go over my supreme move.

564
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,310
The Old Monkey Hangs Up His Badge.

565
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:55,280
- Have you practiced it?
- Yes.

566
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:58,370
You know the key to it?

567
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:01,030
I was never told.

568
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,740
It's looking back in reflection.

569
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:07,410
It's not the upward move,
but the turning back.

570
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:14,050
Understand what I'm saying?

571
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,050
A warrior molds himself to the times.

572
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:24,800
What if... I can't turn back?

573
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:31,350
Then the Gong Family legacy

574
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,560
cannot live on in you.

575
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,430
Stay back.

576
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,510
Let him go.

577
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,090
Never darken my door again.

578
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,480
Get lost.

579
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,580
Master!

580
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:41,010
Oh ye gods and spirits,

581
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:44,600
guide this soul to Paradise!

582
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:29,560
Halt!

583
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:35,520
We have orders from Master Ma San
to escort the Grandmaster's body.

584
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:39,150
Jiang!

585
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,920
Tell Ma San he's a dead man.

586
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,710
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

587
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:12,110
...guide this soul to Paradise!

588
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,480
They're here!

589
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:25,570
Stop her!

590
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:26,750
Keep her back!

591
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:28,080
Let me at her!

592
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,240
Stop her!

593
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,870
Stay back. We're here for Ma San!

594
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:43,840
Since you're my senior,
I won't force my way in.

595
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:46,430
But know this.

596
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,800
You can't hide from me forever.

597
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,220
I'll take back my family's legacy.

598
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:53,970
Come out!

599
01:10:56,230 --> 01:11:00,280
"Better to advance than to stop."

600
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,490
The Old Master taught me this.

601
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,570
It became my philosophy of life.

602
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:09,250
It's a shame
he couldn't follow his own advice.

603
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:12,290
His precious teachings are mine now.

604
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:15,450
You want them,

605
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,790
send someone who's entitled.

606
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,920
You're just a woman.

607
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,140
You don't count.

608
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:46,770
Miss, it's too much of a sacrifice.

609
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:48,290
Is it really worth it?

610
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:51,400
Think it over.

611
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:56,280
Once you take the vow,
there's no turning back.

612
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:03,920
"Better to advance... than to stop."

613
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:09,470
It's the only way to honor my father.

614
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:13,060
I can only advance.

615
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,890
I can't stop.

616
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,270
Is it hard to kill a man?

617
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:42,070
Miss Gong,
it's not like in the old days.

618
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:45,610
Murder is punishable by death.

619
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:49,270
Is Ma San worth it?

620
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:56,160
Miss, we make our own path in life.

621
01:13:56,950 --> 01:14:00,700
Should we go home,
or keep waiting?

622
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,790
It's New Year's Eve.

623
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:07,630
He'll be here soon.

624
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:11,130
- We have to wait.
- All right.

625
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:18,050
We'll wait.

626
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:15,760
This is between Miss Gong and Ma San.

627
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,430
Everyone else stay out of it.

628
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,630
There you are,

629
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,720
still playing with your monkey.

630
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,060
- Deal with him!
- Get him!

631
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:12,070
You're worse than a debt collector,

632
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:15,030
trying to ruin my New Year's Eve.

633
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:18,150
Your dinner may be waiting at home,

634
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,950
but it won't be yours to eat.

635
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:24,070
I let you off before

636
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:27,490
to avoid destroying the Gong clan.

637
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,280
You should know when to give up.

638
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,590
Those needing salvation burn joss.

639
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,330
Those who are hungry, eat.

640
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,960
What I must do,

641
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:41,590
I will do and nothing can stop me.

642
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:45,060
The Gong Family legacy

643
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,930
must return to me tonight.

644
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,150
Fine.

645
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:53,390
It's a part of me.

646
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:57,310
You want it...

647
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:00,160
...come and get it.

648
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,180
Master!

649
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,550
Keep away.

650
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,840
Ma San, speak!

651
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,980
That day...

652
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:19,110
...the Old Master spoke to me...

653
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,920
...about his supreme move:

654
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,330
"Old Monkey Hangs Up His Badge."

655
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,290
He said the key to the move...

656
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,510
...was turning back.

657
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,430
At the time...

658
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,720
...I didn't get it.

659
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:53,980
I thought he couldn't
keep up with the times.

660
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:05,910
The Gong Family legacy...

661
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:10,120
...I return to you.

662
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:13,140
Let's be clear.

663
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:15,640
You didn't return it.

664
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,480
I took it back myself.

665
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,950
Miss Gong!

666
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,710
In the winter of that year,

667
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:09,040
Gong Er stopped seeing patients.

668
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:22,770
Her old injuries
from the fight with Ma San

669
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:25,390
had driven her to opium.

670
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,570
I last saw her at a teahouse.

671
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:29,240
Do you know this opera?

672
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,090
I think I heard it before in Foshan.

673
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:37,330
- Something about a dream.
- "A Dream of Love".

674
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:41,930
Love is just that, a dream.

675
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:48,430
It's said no instrument
is as lovely as a voice.

676
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:52,900
Words always sound better sung.

677
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:56,150
- Has Miss Gong studied opera?
- Just the basics.

678
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:08,740
Back then, if I'd put my mind to it,

679
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,000
I'd be an opera star.

680
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:16,700
All those tales, happy and sad...

681
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:20,460
If I tired
of Yang Family Women Generals,

682
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:22,760
I'd sing "Waking From a Dream."

683
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:26,720
Think of it,

684
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,970
me on stage, you in the audience...

685
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:35,510
...meeting that way.

686
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:37,930
Wouldn't that be something?

687
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:40,650
But what if it was sold out?

688
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:43,200
You flatter me.

689
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:47,330
If you came, I'd save you a seat.

690
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:52,320
You've performed well
in the opera of life.

691
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:55,580
You have both timing and skill.

692
01:27:55,750 --> 01:28:00,170
Unfortunately,
you never saw beyond your role.

693
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:05,430
I'd no idea you watched me
like an opera.

694
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:12,720
This opera of mine,
applauded or not,

695
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:14,810
will play on to the end.

696
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:22,650
I asked you here
to bring things to a close

697
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,740
and say what needs to be said.

698
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,690
Are you going somewhere?

699
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:34,420
We have a saying in the North:

700
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:37,790
A tiger never quits the mountain.

701
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:43,420
We've both been living on foreign soil.

702
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,630
I'm so very tired.

703
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,460
I want to go home.

704
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:56,850
But I wanted to return this
to you first.

705
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,240
As for the 64 Hands...

706
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:20,450
...I've already forgotten them.

707
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:32,210
I was lucky to meet you in my prime.

708
01:29:36,970 --> 01:29:38,850
Sadly, my time is running out.

709
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:45,860
To say there are no regrets in life,

710
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:48,150
is just to fool yourself.

711
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:54,240
How boring it would be without regrets.

712
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:05,130
Mr. lp, to tell you the truth...

713
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,790
...I cared about you.

714
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:22,190
I don't mind telling you that.

715
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:25,060
It's not a crime to love.

716
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:32,200
But that's all it can ever be.

717
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:39,280
I never said that to anyone before.

718
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:43,780
Seeing you tonight,

719
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,800
I don't know why, but it just came out.

720
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:59,050
Let's say we suspend
this game of chess between us.

721
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:07,690
Take care.

722
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:22,290
In life, as in chess,

723
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:24,780
a move, once made, stays on the board.

724
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:31,920
What we have... is simply fate.

725
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:41,560
Your father once said,

726
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:45,050
never give up the faith.

727
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:47,400
Keep the light burning.

728
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:54,570
I hope that one day
I'll see the 64 Hands once more.

729
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:54,300
My father said,
"Mastery has three stages:

730
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:58,220
Being,

731
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,170
knowing,

732
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:03,010
doing."

733
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,770
I know myself.

734
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,610
I've seen the world.

735
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,150
Sadly, I can't pass on what I know.

736
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:30,090
This is a road
I won't see to the end.

737
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:35,090
I hope you will.

738
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
I grew up watching my father fight.

739
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:04,970
The sound most familiar to me
was that of bones breaking.

740
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:32,290
My father was the first
to merge Xingyi and Bagua.

741
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:39,970
When Father practiced Bagua,
he allowed no one to watch.

742
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:43,880
He only taught his disciples Xingyi,

743
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:46,850
for Bagua was lethal.

744
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:19,000
Father always said that if I was
a singer I'd rule the stage,

745
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:22,510
if a nun I'd run the temple,

746
01:36:22,670 --> 01:36:25,540
for I lose myself in my passions.

747
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:32,480
It's a pity I wasn't a boy.

748
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:49,720
What I learned
from my father wasn't skill

749
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,840
so much as a code of honor.

750
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:55,890
Those were my happiest days.

751
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:18,360
Like her father,
Gong Er never lost a fight.

752
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:24,620
She only ever lost to herself.

753
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:31,810
At seven, I started learning kung fu.

754
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:34,190
My master was Chan Wah-shun.

755
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:38,360
Wing Chun was still a secret art,
and disciples were rarely commoners.

756
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:42,290
Pledging loyalty
cost 20 silver dollars,

757
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:44,620
enough money to pay a handsome dowry.

758
01:39:45,710 --> 01:39:49,170
Back then, it was only for the rich.

759
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:54,170
The day I became a disciple,
my master tied my sash himself.

760
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:58,390
This sash stands for school and teacher.

761
01:39:58,550 --> 01:40:04,140
It stands for commitment
to honor and respect our legacy.

762
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:07,070
You are now a martial artist.

763
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:11,980
I lived through dynastic times,
the early Republic, warlords,

764
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:13,700
Japanese invasion and civil war.

765
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:16,700
Finally, I came to Hong Kong.

766
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:21,110
What kept me going
was the spirit of Wing Chun.

767
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:44,680
OK, begin.

768
01:40:56,190 --> 01:41:00,530
They say I popularized Wing Chun.

769
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:04,250
I hope they're right.

770
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:08,710
I never did it for fame.

771
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:11,410
The Martial Arts belong to all.

772
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:15,870
Martial Arts is about kung fu,
not schools.

773
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:21,300
We're all on the same quest.

774
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:24,560
It all comes down to those two words:

775
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:30,850
Horizontal. Vertical.

776
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:05,680

783
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:38,090
You can call me Ip Man.

784
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,260
Or even Old Ip.

785
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:44,090
We can learn from one another.
I really believe that.

786
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:45,890
But fists and feet do what they do.

787
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:47,760
Our fate is up to the gods.

788
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:53,390
Would you agree?

789
01:43:24,010 --> 01:43:25,010
What's your style?
