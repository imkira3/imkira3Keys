1
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,225
Allen, Bomb Squad,
Special Services...

2
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,826
State Police and the FBI!

3
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,725
Lieutenant Jurgenson, Upummer! I want
you to go to St. John's Emergency...

4
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:05,325
in case we got any walk-ins
from the street.

5
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,025
- Take that down there and get it faxed.
- Kramer, get the city engineer!

6
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:10,425
I gotta find out a damage report.
It's very important.

7
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:13,125
Bonwit Teller. Who the hell would want
to blow up a department store?

8
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:15,125
Did you ever see a woman
miss a shoe sale?

9
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:17,625
Connie, I want you to get started
on the witness sheet.

10
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:21,125
Ricky, you and Joe, you make sure
the uniforms got it cordoned off there.

11
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:24,725
And you don't let
the damn TV crews in. Benson!

12
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:28,125
- Inspector, phone.
- Not now. Benson! Traffic!

13
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:31,726
We get Fifth Avenue cleared up by 3:00,
or we got the traffic jam from hell!

14
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:33,726
- Walter!
- Yeah?

15
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:37,226
I think you'd better take this.

16
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,426
Major Case Unit,
Inspector Cobb.

17
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,626
Said Simple Simon to the pie man
going to the fair...

18
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:45,926
"Give me your pies...

19
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:48,926
or I'll cave your head in."

20
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:52,326
You see, Bonwit's was just
to make sure I had your attention.

21
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:55,726
Is there a detective
named McClane there?

22
00:02:56,026 --> 00:03:00,726
- He's on suspension.
- No, Walter, he's not. Not today.

23
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:03,626
- Who is this?
- Call me Simon.

24
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:06,826
- What do you want?
- I want to play a game.

25
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:09,826
- What kind of game?
- "Simon says."

26
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,926
Simon's going to tell
Lt McClane what to do...

27
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:17,226
and Lt McClane is going to do it.

28
00:03:17,626 --> 00:03:20,726
Noncompliance will result
in a penalty.

29
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,726
What penalty?

30
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:26,126
Another big bang
in a very public place.

31
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:31,526
What is it that you want
Lt McClane to do?

32
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:34,126
Simon says Lt McClane
is to go to the corner...

33
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:37,026
of 138th Street und Amsterdam...

34
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:39,326
which is in Harlem
if I'm not mistaken.

35
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:43,427
Kowalski! Lambert!
Do you know where to find McClane?

36
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:45,627
Well, I kinda doubt
you're gonna find him in church.

37
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:49,127
Well, you better find out
what rock he's under...

38
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:50,927
and kick it over.

39
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:06,527
- John.
- Thanks.

40
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:15,927
Gimme some more. Come on.

41
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:20,427
Jesus, John.
You look like shit.

42
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:27,427
Where did we leave off
with that roster?

43
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:31,127
We got three killings in Red Hook
the past two nights.

44
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:33,627
Put Miner on it.
And Genetti.

45
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:35,727
The mayor's office will call
before the day's out.

46
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:40,227
Next, 14 dump trucks stolen
from a yard in Staten Island.

47
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:44,827
Fourteen! Jesus! Is somebody
starting a construction company?

48
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,527
Nah, it was John's landlady
going to clean his apartment.

49
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:52,027
Insurance fraud.

50
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:54,928
That's a priority
out in California.

51
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,228
The contractor splits the money
with the thieves.

52
00:04:57,428 --> 00:04:59,928
We had that out in Jersey
a couple years ago, Joe. Remember?

53
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:03,328
See what Kelly can do with it.

54
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:05,528
Hey, what was the lottery number
last night?

55
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:07,828
- 4667.
- 4667.

56
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:11,628
You still bettin' your badge, Rick?

57
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:14,428
Yeah, 6991 every week.

58
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:18,628
6991, lucky number.

59
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:21,628
Half the cops in New York
play their badges.

60
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:24,828
How're the kids, John?

61
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:27,728
I hear they're okay.

62
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,228
Did you talk with Holly?

63
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:36,228
- No, I didn't talk to Holly.
- Coming up on it, Inspector.

64
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,328
Is it hot in here,
or am I just scared to death?

65
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:43,828
You wanna make sure
the gun's secure?

66
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:46,128
Yeah, it's good.

67
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:56,028
You know, you're the first woman
since Holly who's seen me do this.

68
00:05:56,328 --> 00:06:00,528
- I'm honoured.
- Yeah, so was she.

69
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:07,029
So, where's the backup gonna be?

70
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,329
We're gonna drop back
to 128th Street.

71
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:15,929
What?

72
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,929
Ten blocks?
Are you fucking kidding me?

73
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,529
Oh, man, that's just great! Hey, Walter,
what is all this about, huh?

74
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:26,029
- If we don't do it, this guy says he's
gonna blow up another public place.
- Well, why me?

75
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:30,529
- What does it got to do with me?
- I have no idea. He just said
it had to be you.

76
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:35,629
It's nice to be needed.

77
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:39,129
- Frankly, John, you haven't been...
- Hey, Walter, how 'bout you mind your
fucking business about Holly, huh?

78
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:44,129
Between you and Simon, you're
fucking up a perfectly good hangover.

79
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:49,229
Okay.

80
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:01,129
We'll be back to pick you up
in 15 minutes.

81
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:04,529
Take your time.
I expect to be dead in four.

82
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:08,029
Let's go, Billy!

83
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,330
Oh, man.

84
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,230
- Hey, yo, Uncle.
- Come look at this.

85
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,130
It's ten after 9:00.
Why aren't you in school?

86
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,630
- Tony wants to sell you this.
- Tony? That no-neck dude
they call Bad T?

87
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,930
He says he found it
in a Dumpster.

88
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,530
He keeps stealing from people,
they're gonna find him in a Dumpster.

89
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,630
No, he didn't steal it.
He says his uncle gave it to him.

90
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,930
Mm-hmm. Hand me
that newspaper over there.

91
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,530
Don't ever let people use you.

92
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,631
You're runnin' all over town
with stolen property.

93
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:29,631
If you get caught,
you get in trouble...

94
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:32,031
while he gets to deny
the whole thing and walk away.

95
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:35,431
You... You mean you want us
to take it back to Tony?

96
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:38,831
No, I'll take it back to Tony,
with a message.

97
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:42,531
- Now, where you goin'?
- School.

98
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:44,531
- Why?
- To get educated?

99
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:46,631
- Why?
- So we can go to college.

100
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:48,831
- And why is that important?
- To get "espect."

101
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,931
"Respect."
And who's the bad guys?

102
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,831
- Guys who sell drugs.
- Guys who have guns.

103
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:55,831
- And who's the good guys?
- We're the good guys.

104
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:57,931
- Who's gonna help you?
- Nobody.

105
00:08:58,131 --> 00:09:00,331
- So who's gonna help you?
- We're gonna help ourselves.

106
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:02,931
- And who do we not want to help us?
- White people.
- White people.

107
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,731
That's right.

108
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:09,231
Now, get on outta here.
Go to school.

109
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:15,431
- Uncle, you better come look at this.
- What?

110
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:17,631
There's a white man
standing in the street.

111
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:20,531
- I seen one.
- Not like this.

112
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:32,931
Dial 9-1-1. Tell the police
to get up here quick.

113
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:37,931
Somebody's about to get killed. And get
your butts to school. You hear me?

114
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:40,432
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- All right.

115
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:47,432
- I paid 500 bucks...
- You better back off, man.

116
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:59,132
- Hey, man!
- He ain't so big.

117
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:09,332
- Morning.
- Good morning.

118
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:12,932
You having a nice day, sir?
You feeling all right?

119
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:15,032
Not to get too personal...

120
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:17,132
but a white man standin'
in the middle of Harlem...

121
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:19,632
wearin' a sign that says
"I hate niggers"...

122
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:21,932
has either got some serious
personal issues...

123
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:24,632
or not all his dogs are barkin'.

124
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,332
Hey, I'm talkin' to you!

125
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:30,132
Now, you got about ten seconds
before those guys see you.

126
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:33,132
When they do, they will kill you.
You understand?

127
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:37,032
You are about to have
a very bad day.

128
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:40,832
Tell me about it.
Sir, this is a police matter.

129
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:43,632
- For your own safety, I'm gonna
ask you to step across the street.
- You damn right it's a police matter!

130
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:46,632
For your own safety, I suggest
you hide your butt in my shop
till the police get here.

131
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:49,032
What the fuck?

132
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:53,233
Aw, shit.

133
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,733
- Listen, I'm a cop. I'm on a case.
- What?

134
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:04,233
Somebody blew up
Bonwit Teller's an hour ago.
Did you hear about that on the news?

135
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,233
- Yeah.
- The same asshole that did that said...

136
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,233
I gotta come to Harlem and do this
or he's gonna blow up something else.

137
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,133
- Do you understand?
- Shit, shit, shit.

138
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:12,133
- Listen, I got a gun.
You should get across the street.
- They got ten guns.

139
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:14,233
- You should get across the street!
- Look, start acting crazy, all right?

140
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:16,733
- What?
- Like Looney Tunes.
You know, like Bellevue?

141
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:21,333
- Hey, Zeus, this a friend of yours?
- He look like a friend of mine?

142
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:25,533
I think the dude just escaped from
some hospital. You know, like Bellevue?

143
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:33,933
I am the voice of my own god.

144
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,233
And my god did...

145
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,633
I told the librarian that I had a bad
headache, but she didn't believe me.

146
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,533
I really do have a bad headache, though.
I have a very bad headache!

147
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:45,133
- And my head does not feel...
- Oh, man, shut the fuck...

148
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:47,433
- Who in the fuck...
- You've made a very bad mistake.
- Kick his ass.

149
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:50,333
- Put it through his head.
- Bust his head.

150
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:54,033
Cut this shit off!
Fellas! Fellas!

151
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,533
Nature boy here hates niggers.
Now, what are we gonna do about that?

152
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,433
- Fight him!
- Yo, yo, yo, yo!
Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!

153
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,434
- Oh, shit!
- Yeah!

154
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:05,734
Get him! Get him!

155
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,834
- Back! Back up!
- Hey, what you trippin' on?

156
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:12,234
- Back the fuck up! Now!
- Hey, you better quit that, boy!

157
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:16,034
Come on, man, get up.
Get up! Get outta here!

158
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,634
Stop the c...
Stop the goddam cab!

159
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:22,034
- Don't shoot!
No, don't shoot me! Don't shoot!
- Don't move that cab! Get up!

160
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,134
- Come on, get up!
- Yo, you sayin' you gonna kill us?

161
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:27,934
I mean it! I don't want to, but I will!
You know I will! Come on. Drive! Drive!

162
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:30,734
- Drive! Go! Go! Go! Drive, goddam it!
-  Get the fuck outta here!

163
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:34,034
Drive! Drive!
Don't stop! Don't stop!

164
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:36,734
- Just keep driving!
Run the red light! Drive!
- Don't shoot me, man! That's all I got!

165
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:38,734
- That's all I got.
- Man, put that fuckin' money away!

166
00:12:38,934 --> 00:12:40,734
- Nobody's robbing you, asshole!
- Don't kill me!
- Nobody's gonna kill you!

167
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,634
- Shit!
- Just run all the lights! Drive!

168
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:44,834
- Oh, man! Damn!
- We got a bus.

169
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:46,834
- That cut deep?
- How the hell would I know?

170
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:49,134
Just keep pressure on it.

171
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,634
Oh, fuck!

172
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:55,334
- Jesus, right? John McClane.
I owe you one.
- Damn right, you owe me!

173
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:58,434
- You got any idea what those guys
are doin' to my shop right now?
- Chill out, Jesus!

174
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:00,534
- We'll send a car for...
- "Chill out"? What the fuck?
Are you tryin' to relate to me?

175
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:02,834
- Talk like a white man!
- Okay. Jesus, I'm sorry
you got involved, all right?

176
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:05,134
Why do you keep calling me Jesus?
I look Puerto Rican to you?

177
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,634
- Guy back there
called you Jesus, didn't he?
- He didn't say Jesus!

178
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:10,834
- He said, "Hey, Zeus." My name is Zeus.
- Zeus?

179
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:14,035
Yeah, Zeus! As in father of Apollo!
Mount Olympus!

180
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:17,035
"Don't fuck with me, or I'll shove
a lightning bolt up your ass!"

181
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:20,235
Zeus! You got a problem with that?

182
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:23,035
- No, I don't have a problem with that.
- Shit!

183
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:27,035
- Downtown. Police Plaza.
- That's just great.

184
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:33,935
Get a record of all his collars,
recent releases...

185
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:36,135
and a list of anybody else
he might have looked at sideways.

186
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:38,535
It's probably as long as your arm,
so I'm gonna need some help with it.

187
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:41,635
It's textbook megalomania.
It's a pathological state...

188
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:45,035
in which fantasies of control
or omnipotence predominate.

189
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:48,835
He wants control over him.
He wants control over his actions,
over his thoughts, even his emotions.

190
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:52,635
- Sounds like you got
a secret admirer, John.
- Yeah, maybe he'll send me some flowers.

191
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:56,235
- Everybody knows you like pansies.
- It's not tha0 kind o- emotion.

192
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,635
- This guy is ugly.
- How is that?

193
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:01,535
Nothin' wrong with him
a shower wouldn't cure.

194
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:04,135
Beer is normally taken
internally, John.

195
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:07,535
- Just get me some aspirins, will ya?
- Yeah, okay. Hold this here.

196
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:10,635
This is Fred Schiller, John,
and he's a...

197
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:14,435
- A shrink. Yeah, I got it.
- Yes. I was saying that we're dealing...

198
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:17,735
with a megalomaniacal personality
with possible paranoid schizophrenia.

199
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:21,935
Hey, hey, how about we just skip down
to the part where you tell me what
the fuck this has to do with me, huh?

200
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:26,136
I don't know. I mean,
what I do know is it does have
specifically to do with you.

201
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:29,636
This guy wants to pound on you
till you crumble.

202
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,736
He wants you to dance
to his tune and then...

203
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:34,836
Put on a dress and fuck me?

204
00:14:35,036 --> 00:14:37,136
I was going to say kill you.

205
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:40,036
- Pick up five, goddam it!
- He's sitting on an awful lot of rage...

206
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:43,536
and it could be manifested physically
if he's stressed.

207
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:46,036
Somebody he arrested?
Somebody he pissed off?

208
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:48,936
- That could be one hell of a long list.
- Fuck you, Joe.

209
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:51,336
See, these people don't like
to work anonymously.

210
00:14:51,536 --> 00:14:53,836
They want you to know
who's doing it to you.

211
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:55,836
So this name "Simon"
is probably not an alias.

212
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:58,336
It's probably "Simon"
or some variation.

213
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:02,436
"Simon, Robert E. Busted in '86,
extortion, kidnapping, ten to fifteen.

214
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:06,036
Did seven years for good behaviour.
Released on a state work-furlough
two months ago."

215
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:08,236
- Check it.
- Thanks, Rick.

216
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:11,736
Bob Simons was a bankrupt businessman
who kidnapped his partner's daughter.

217
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:14,736
He's a fuckup, not a psycho.
The guy we're lookin' for is nuts.

218
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:17,736
A nut who knows a lot about bombs.

219
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:20,636
We found this in a playground.
Professional!

220
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:23,836
Very cool stuff.
You know, boom!

221
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:27,836
- You think you should
slam it around like that, Charlie?
- When it's unmixed, you can't hurt it.

222
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,636
This stuff is cutting edge.
It's a binary liquid.

223
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:33,636
- A what?
- Like epoxy.

224
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:35,636
Two liquids.

225
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,437
Either one by itself...

226
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:43,137
you got nothin', but mix 'em...

227
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,237
Ricky.

228
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:02,937
Charlie, you're gonna be wearing
that shirt up your ass!

229
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:06,337
- Christ Almighty, Charlie!
- Like I said, very cool stuff.

230
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:08,937
Now, with a package like this,
you get a warning.

231
00:16:09,237 --> 00:16:11,137
Now, the bomb has to arm itself.

232
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:15,537
You'll see the red liquid
pump into the clear before it detonates.

233
00:16:15,737 --> 00:16:18,937
- How long before?
- Ten seconds, two minutes.

234
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:21,037
Could be anything.

235
00:16:21,237 --> 00:16:24,537
But once it's mixed,
be somewhere else.

236
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:26,537
This stuff has gotta be pretty rare.

237
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,537
We oughta be able to find out
if any of it's missin' somewhere.

238
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:31,737
I already did. Livermore Labs
theft over the weekend.

239
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:34,137
He got enough to make
another one, Joe?

240
00:16:34,337 --> 00:16:37,337
- About 2,000 pounds.
- Of that?

241
00:16:37,637 --> 00:16:40,837
Well, the detonating mechanism
could be anything... radio, electrical.

242
00:16:41,137 --> 00:16:43,437
Hell, you could use a beeper
and phone it in.

243
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:47,737
- Inspector? Inspector, it's him.
- He's got a double Alberti
feedback loop on it.

244
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:50,838
- A nasty little trick
I believe once used in Lebanon.
- Charlie. Charlie!

245
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:52,538
- Charlie, shh!
- What?

246
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:54,538
Wanna start the trace?

247
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:03,138
Simon.

248
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:06,338
He wore the board,
walked the street and survived.

249
00:17:07,938 --> 00:17:11,738
- Where are my pigeons now?
- Pigeons?

250
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:15,338
I had two pigeons, bright and gay,
fly from me the other day.

251
00:17:15,738 --> 00:17:18,938
Why was it they did go?
You cannot tell. You do not know.

252
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,838
- You mean McClane?
- No, I mean Santa Claus.

253
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:29,738
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Ah, there after all. And your friend?

254
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:32,538
Carver! Carver! Come on.
We need you in the other room.

255
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:35,938
- Let's go! Come on!
- They need you. Go.

256
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:38,938
- Yeah, he's here too.
- And may I speak with him?

257
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:43,338
Well, is the ebony
Samaritan there now?

258
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:45,938
- You got a problem with ebony?
- No, no.

259
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:50,238
My only problem is that I went to some
trouble preparing that game for McClane.

260
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:52,738
You interfered
with a well-laid plan.

261
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,938
Yeah? Well, you can stick your
well-laid plan up your well-laid ass.

262
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:03,439
That was not smart.
There are lives at stake here!

263
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:07,139
- Not enough time, Inspector.
- You better hope he calls back.

264
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:08,839
He will.

265
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:14,039
Ricky, you wanna tell those people
to shut the hell up out there!

266
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:17,039
Hey, keep it down here!

267
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:28,539
Simon, he wasn't speaking
for all of us.

268
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,039
That was unpleasant.
Don't let it happen again.

269
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:35,339
- So, what's your name, boy?
- Don't call me "boy."

270
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:38,839
I'm sorry.
It was a poor attempt at humour.

271
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,139
I was going to send you home
with a chiding...

272
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:44,039
- but now I think perhaps
you should join the game.
- We got him!

273
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,239
It's a pay phone in Oslo.

274
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:48,239
- No, w-wait, they say
it's Juarez, Mexico.
- Norway?

275
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:51,039
No, wait. No, wait. N-Now
they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.

276
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:54,639
Forget it! Australia?
He's scrambling up their system.
They don't know where he is.

277
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,839
Having fun with
the phone company, are we?

278
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,739
Simon says,
McClane and the Samaritan...

279
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,739
will go to the subway station
at 72nd and Broadway.

280
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:07,139
I will call you in 15 minutes
on the pay phone outside the station.

281
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,939
No police. Failure to answer
will constitute noncompliance.

282
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:13,540
Do you understand me, John?

283
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Oh, yes, I understand. I understand
that you're a fuckin' wacko...

284
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
that likes to play kids games,
that's what I understand.

285
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,240
- Hardly.
- Hardly?

286
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,540
Well, then, who are you?
Somebody I sent up? What'd you do?

287
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Shoplifting? Purse snatching?
Cross dressing? What?

288
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,340
You c-c-couldn't catch me if I stole
your ch-chair with you in it.

289
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,240
My ch-ch-ch-chair with me in it?
Ooh-hoo! That's very exciting.

290
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,340
Let me ask you a question, bonehead.
Why are you trying to k-k-k-kill me?

291
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,640
- John, John, calm yourself.
- Why don't you come on
down here to Police Plaza...

292
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,640
and we'll figure this out
like a couple of men, huh?

293
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,840
- Just come on down here.
- If killing you was all I wanted...

294
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,440
- Simon, this is Inspector Cobb.
- you'd be dead by now.

295
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,240
I can appreciate your feelings
for McClane...

296
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,040
but believe me,
the jerk isn't worth it.

297
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,440
He's stepped on so many toes
in this department...

298
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,040
by this time next month
he's gonna be a security guard.

299
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
His own wife wants
nothing to do with him...

300
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,540
and he's about two steps shy
of becoming a full-blown alcoholic.

301
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,340
One step. One step.

302
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,340
Now listen to me.

303
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,240
You sound like a real smart guy.
What is it that you want?

304
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Are you talking about money?

305
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,240
Well, whatever, whatever.

306
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,041
McClane is a toilet bug.

307
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:28,541
Now what would it take just to forget
him and live happily ever after?

308
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:30,741
You know, money is shit to me.

309
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:35,041
I would not give up McClane
for all the gold in your Fort Knox.

310
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:38,341
72nd Street subway,
pay phone, 15 minutes.

311
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,441
McClane and the Samaritan.

312
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:43,141
If you're competent in the least,
you've found the briefcase...

313
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:46,241
so you know what I mean by penalty.

314
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:51,241
I wanna thank you for that vote
of confidence, Walter.

315
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,341
Well, I thought it was worth a try.
This guy's a raving maniac.

316
00:20:54,741 --> 00:20:57,241
Well, he-he couldn't be any clearer
if he got it from a case history.

317
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:59,341
He gave you clues
to his identity.

318
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:02,341
He spoke German.
He called it "your Fort Knox."

319
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:04,341
And he stammered
when McClane pushed him.

320
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,541
Now, you believe this guy
really can't be bought?

321
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:10,741
There's no chance. The very mention
of money only enraged him further.

322
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:22,241
- What's that?
- It's your shield.

323
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,841
- You askin' me to be
a cop again, Walter?
- Ricky, get him his gun, all right?

324
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:28,841
- You didn't answer my question. Hey!
- Joe, this time they...

325
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:33,541
- You didn't answer my question, Walter.
- Are you done, Lieutenant?

326
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:38,342
Now, you two better get going if you're
going to get up to 72nd Street on time.

327
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:41,142
- Joe, this time they go with backup.
- You got it.

328
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,942
- Come on, you guys!
- I'm not goin' anywhere.

329
00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:48,142
- Simon says you gotta go!
- I'm not jumpin' through hoops
for some psycho!

330
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:51,042
That's a white man with white problems.
You deal with him.

331
00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:56,042
- Call me when he crosses 110th Street.
- Hey! Why'd you save my ass?

332
00:21:56,342 --> 00:22:00,142
I didn't. I stopped a white cop
from gettin' killed in Harlem.

333
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:02,242
One white cop gets killed today...

334
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:05,942
tomorrow we got a thousand white cops,
all of 'em with itchy trigger fingers.

335
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,442
- Got it?
- Get him back.

336
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:15,142
- Charlie, where'd you find that bomb?
- Chinatown.

337
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:17,342
Shit.

338
00:22:17,442 --> 00:22:20,242
Zeus! Yo, partner! Wait up!

339
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,342
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I ain't your partner.

340
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:26,142
I ain't your neighbour, your brother
or your friend. I'm your total stranger.

341
00:22:27,342 --> 00:22:29,442
Okay, stranger...

342
00:22:29,742 --> 00:22:32,842
you know where that park is
at 115th Street and St Nicholas?

343
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:39,042
- Yeah, it's in Harlem.
- Where do you think
we found that bomb?

344
00:22:39,342 --> 00:22:44,442
Listen, this guy doesn't care
about skin colour, even if you do.

345
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:50,643
- What am I doin'?
- Cheer up. Things could be worse.

346
00:22:50,943 --> 00:22:53,043
I was workin'
on a nice, fat suspension...

347
00:22:53,243 --> 00:22:55,243
smokin' cigarettes
and watchin' Captain Kangaroo.

348
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:57,643
Come on.

349
00:23:00,943 --> 00:23:02,743
Is that the phone?

350
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:08,743
Okay, they made it to the phone,
but there's a problem.

351
00:23:08,843 --> 00:23:10,743
Well, what do you mean?
How big a problem?

352
00:23:11,043 --> 00:23:12,943
Oh, about 300 pounds.

353
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,143
- And they're probably going to end up
having to get an operation.
- Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.

354
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:17,143
- We need this phone
for official police business.
- Do you mind!

355
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:19,143
- Honey, I'm a cop.
I need the phone right now.
- I'm sorry, but I can no...

356
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:21,743
Get off the damn phone, lady!
Police business!

357
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:24,243
- Well, I never!
- I can get used to this.

358
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:27,043
I'm sure you can find a phone
across the street, ma'am.

359
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:29,843
Let's get something straight.
I'm the only one here
on official police business.

360
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:32,643
- Don't ever do that shit again.
- Let's get somethin' else straight.

361
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:34,943
You need me
a lot more than I need you.

362
00:23:35,243 --> 00:23:38,043
You don't like the way
I do things, fine. I quit.

363
00:23:41,543 --> 00:23:43,343
I don't know.

364
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:49,343
All right, I need you.

365
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:57,944
All right, I need you
more than you need me.

366
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:05,444
- Hello!
- Birds of a feather flock together.
So do pigs and swine.

367
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,744
Rats and mice have their chance,
as will I have mine.

368
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:10,744
Nice. Rhymes.

369
00:24:11,044 --> 00:24:14,544
- Why was the phone busy?
Who were you calling?
- The Psychic Hotline.

370
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,544
I'd advise you to take this
more seriously.

371
00:24:16,744 --> 00:24:18,544
Look, it's a public phone!
What do you want me to say?

372
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:22,744
You can simply say
there was a fat woman on it, and it
took you a minute to get her off!

373
00:24:24,344 --> 00:24:27,744
Now, John, there's a significant
amount of explosive...

374
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:29,944
in the trash receptacle next to you.

375
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,044
Try to run,
and it goes up now.

376
00:24:34,344 --> 00:24:36,344
Nobody's gonna run, but I got
a hundred people out here!

377
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:40,144
That's the point.
Now, do I have your attention?

378
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:42,944
As I was going to St Ives,
I met a man with seven wives.

379
00:24:43,244 --> 00:24:45,744
Every wife had seven sacks.
Every sack had seven cats.

380
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:48,344
Every cat had seven kittens.
Kittens, cats, sacks and wives.

381
00:24:48,644 --> 00:24:51,844
How many were going to St Ives?
My phone number is 555...

382
00:24:52,144 --> 00:24:54,844
- No, no, no! Wait! I didn't
get all that! Say it again!
- Not a chance.

383
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:58,144
- My phone number is 555 and the answer.
- But I didn't...

384
00:24:58,344 --> 00:25:00,544
Call me in 30 seconds or die.

385
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:06,044
- All right,
seven guys with seven wives makes...
- Shut up, McClane. I'm good at this.

386
00:25:06,444 --> 00:25:09,845
- Seven guys with seven wives makes...
- Shut the fuck up, McClane!
He said seven wives with seven sacks.

387
00:25:10,045 --> 00:25:12,445
- Seven times seven is 49.
Now tell me the rest.
- Seven wives?

388
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:14,745
- A sack with...
s-seven sacks with seven...
- Weren't you listening?

389
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:16,945
- Yeah, I was listening.
I didn't hear every fuckin' thing...
- What the heck is wrong with you?

390
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:19,845
- Well, I... Besides having
a bad fuckin' hangover, for one thing!
- All right, all right, all right.

391
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:22,145
Seven wives times seven, 49.
With seven cats.

392
00:25:22,345 --> 00:25:24,445
Seven times 49 is 343, right?

393
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:27,945
- What, are you asking me or telling me?
- I'm telling you. 343 times seven is...

394
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:32,145
One, zero, 24. 2,401.
That's what you got, right?

395
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:34,345
Yeah, that's what I got.
Is that it, 2,401?

396
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:37,845
- That's it. Dial. 555-2401.
- 555-2401.

397
00:25:39,445 --> 00:25:42,245
- No, wait, wait!
It's a trick. It's a trick.
- What? What? What do you mean?

398
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:45,045
- I forgot about the man.
- What man? Fuck the man!
We got ten seconds left!

399
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:47,445
He said how many were going
to St Ives, right?

400
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,845
The riddle begins: As I was going to
St Ives, I met a man with seven wives.

401
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:54,045
- The guy and his wives
aren't goin' anywhere.
- What are they doing?

402
00:25:54,245 --> 00:25:56,745
Sittin' in the fuckin' road
waitin' on a mo...
How the hell should I know, McClane?

403
00:25:56,945 --> 00:26:00,245
- Well, who's going to St Ives then?
- The guy. Just the guy.

404
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:02,545
- Just one guy? Just one guy.
- The answer's one.

405
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:05,245
- How do you dial one?
- 555-0001.

406
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:08,245
- Zero, zero, one. Just one guy's going?
- Hello, John.

407
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:10,745
Yeah, piece of cake.
Give us somethin' harder next time.

408
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,545
- But you're ten seconds late.
- No, no! The answer is one! The...

409
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:16,245
- Boom!
- There's a bomb in the trash! Get down!
- Everybody, get down!

410
00:26:16,445 --> 00:26:19,545
Get down! There's a bomb!
Everybody, get down!

411
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:22,246
There's a bomb!

412
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:24,946
Get down! There's a bomb!

413
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,246
- Welcome to New York.
- Really.

414
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:35,746
They were just talking.
Here, you can have it. Come on.

415
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:38,146
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm getting outta here right now.

416
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,046
- I told you it wasn't a bomb.
- I thought there was a bomb!

417
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:54,346
No bomb.

418
00:27:00,346 --> 00:27:03,646
- Yeah.
- I didn't say "Simon says."

419
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:08,546
It's 9:50,John.
The number 3 train is arriving now.

420
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:12,046
I left something provocative
on that train, John.

421
00:27:12,346 --> 00:27:14,546
Simon says,
get to the pay phone...

422
00:27:14,746 --> 00:27:17,946
next to the news kiosk
in Wall Street Station by 10:20...

423
00:27:18,246 --> 00:27:21,346
- Half an hour.
- or the number 3 train
and its passengers vaporize.

424
00:27:21,646 --> 00:27:24,946
Use any means of travel
other than civilian, I blow the train.

425
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:27,646
Attempt to evacuate the subway,
I blow the train.

426
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,746
I'll call you in 30 minutes.
Be there.

427
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:34,347
- We're fucked.
- Ninety blocks in 30 minutes?

428
00:27:34,547 --> 00:27:38,047
In New York traffic?
It could be double that.

429
00:27:38,347 --> 00:27:40,947
We don't even have a car!

430
00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:43,147
Hey! Hey! Sir! Sir!
I'm a cop! I'm a cop!

431
00:27:43,347 --> 00:27:45,747
- I am requisitioning this car
for official police business.
- Hey, what are you doing?

432
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:48,447
- Thank you very much. Get in! Get in!
- What the fuck you doing to my car?
- Pretty slick.

433
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:51,947
Listen, I used to drive a cab.
The fastest way south is...

434
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:54,747
What the fuck are you doing?

435
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:03,747
- What were you sayin'?
- I was saying I used to drive a cab.

436
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:07,847
Ninth Avenue is the fastest way south.
But we seem to be going east.

437
00:28:14,147 --> 00:28:17,047
Where the hell are you going, McClane?
I told you Ninth Avenue
was the quickest way south!

438
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:20,947
- Stop with that goddam yelling!
I know what I'm doing!
- Not even God knows what you're doing!

439
00:28:21,247 --> 00:28:23,747
They're headed east on 72nd
towards the park.

440
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:27,147
- But Wall Street is south!
- Man, stop yelling at me!
I got a bad headache!

441
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:30,647
And the best way south is not
Ninth Avenue, it's through the park.

442
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:34,647
Oh, dear.

443
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,947
I told you the park drive
is always jammed.

444
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:39,747
I didn't say park drive.

445
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:43,547
I said through the park.

446
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:49,048
Shit! We lost 'em.
They're in the park headed south.

447
00:28:50,448 --> 00:28:53,848
- Get outta here!
- Fucking prick!

448
00:28:59,748 --> 00:29:02,848
I got him, Connie.
He's taking the scenic route.

449
00:29:03,248 --> 00:29:05,548
- Outta the way!
- Oh, man.

450
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,248
Get out! Get outta there!

451
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:16,448
Watch it, watch it, watch it,
watch it! Oh, my God!

452
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:18,448
Are you... Are you aiming
for these people?

453
00:29:18,648 --> 00:29:21,048
No. Well, maybe that mime.

454
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:24,348
Tree! Tree! Tree!

455
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:31,348
What's goin' on here?

456
00:29:33,748 --> 00:29:35,848
Look out!

457
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:40,148
- Tree! Tree!
- Just hang on.

458
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:43,048
Rock! Rock! Rock!

459
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:51,348
Hey, look out down there!

460
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:55,248
McClane! McClane, watch it.

461
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:01,449
McClane!

462
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:09,349
Come on! Outta the way!

463
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:12,049
- How do Catholics do their thing?
- North, south, west, east.

464
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:14,949
- How much time?
- Twenty-seven minutes.

465
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:18,449
Ha! 72nd and Broadway
to Central Park South in three minutes!

466
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:22,049
That's gotta be a fuckin' record.

467
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:24,949
Come on, get out...

468
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:27,749
Yeah. Now what?

469
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:36,649
- We need a fire truck.
- What?

470
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:38,749
To follow.

471
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:44,549
- 9-1-1.
- Lt John McClane, NYPD.

472
00:30:44,749 --> 00:30:47,549
Access number 7479.
Calling from a civilian transmitter.

473
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:50,949
- Get me an emergency
dispatcher right away.
- Dispatch. Go ahead.

474
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,649
I got two officers down at the corner
of 14th Street and Ninth Avenue!

475
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:55,949
Need an ambulance! Over!

476
00:30:56,249 --> 00:30:59,149
Emergency calls on the west side
go to Roosevelt Hospital.
That's two blocks from here.

477
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,750
- Slow the fuck down, McClane!
- Kinda like football, isn't it?

478
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,250
- What?
- Get yourself a blocker
and head for the end zone!

479
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,650
If you'd said Wall Street,
we could've followed him all the way.

480
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,050
Wrong! South of 14th Street's
a different hospital!

481
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,050
St Luke's. Hang on.

482
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,450
- Time?
- 10:02.

483
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,050
We're halfway there
with 18 minutes to go.

484
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,150
Fuck this! Hang on.

485
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,750
Hang on. Get outta there!
Slide over and take the wheel.

486
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,051
- Where you goin'?
- We should be ahead
of that train, right?

487
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:23,351
- You're not gonna get on that train...
- I'm gonna get on that train! You gotta
get to that pay phone by 10:20!

488
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,451
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna get that bomb.

489
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:28,251
Listen, you fail, I cover your ass.
I fail, you cover my ass.

490
00:32:28,651 --> 00:32:31,951
- And if we both fail?
- Then we're both fucked.

491
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:35,651
Go now! Drive! Get to that
phone booth by 10:20! Go!

492
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:38,351
My lucky fuckin' day.

493
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,251
Shit! Look out, ma'am!

494
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:50,351
Look out! Look out! Look out!
Get outta the way!

495
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:59,051
This is a bad idea!

496
00:33:25,651 --> 00:33:27,351
Excuse me! Excuse me!

497
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:30,552
Just get outta the way, please!

498
00:33:43,352 --> 00:33:47,352
- 112 Wall Street.
- Wait. This isn't a taxi.
You don't understand.

499
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,852
Your light's on.
I'll make it simple.

500
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:53,252
112 Wall Street, or I'll have
your medallion suspended.

501
00:33:53,552 --> 00:33:56,552
What, you don't like
white people?

502
00:33:56,852 --> 00:34:01,352
112 Wall Street?
You got it.

503
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:07,152
Come on.

504
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:13,152
Fuck!
Move your legs, sir.

505
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,952
Get your legs outta the way!
Sorry. Sorry.

506
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:31,652
- Hey! Excuse me!
- 1823405...

507
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:42,753
Hey!

508
00:34:58,553 --> 00:34:59,753
Shit!

509
00:35:01,153 --> 00:35:03,153
Excuse me! Watch out!
Excuse me, sir.

510
00:35:03,453 --> 00:35:05,453
Pardon me, please. Excu...

511
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:09,853
- Will you step outta here for a minute.
- What?

512
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:13,253
I'm a cop. Step out of here
for a minute, please. Will ya?

513
00:35:40,153 --> 00:35:42,453
Excuse me, please!
Let me get through here, please!

514
00:35:42,653 --> 00:35:46,653
- It's him.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Pardon.

515
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:49,953
Excuse me, sir, but I'm expecting
a call. I need that phone.

516
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:52,753
Why don't you use
the other phone?

517
00:35:57,054 --> 00:36:00,354
Sir, please.
I need to use that phone.

518
00:36:00,754 --> 00:36:03,354
Hey, listen, bro,
I was here first.

519
00:36:03,554 --> 00:36:07,254
"Bro"? Get away
from the goddam phone!

520
00:36:07,554 --> 00:36:10,054
Put your hands up!

521
00:36:26,154 --> 00:36:29,954
- I have to answer that phone.
- Just shut up and get 'em in the air!

522
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:33,654
Watch it! Excuse me! Pardon me!
Watch, watch your back! Watch it!

523
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:36,154
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm a New York police officer.

524
00:36:36,354 --> 00:36:40,254
I'm gonna ask you to calmly
and quietly start moving towards
the other end of the car.

525
00:36:40,554 --> 00:36:43,454
Go now, please! Go now!

526
00:36:43,754 --> 00:36:46,654
Fuck! Let's go!
Watch it! Watch out!

527
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:49,454
Watch... Watch it! Go!

528
00:36:52,454 --> 00:36:55,754
I have to answer that phone.

529
00:36:55,954 --> 00:36:58,254
Get 'em up!

530
00:36:58,454 --> 00:37:01,554
Look, if you have to shoot me...

531
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:04,855
then you go ahead
and you shoot me!

532
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:09,455
But I have to answer this phone,
all right?

533
00:37:14,955 --> 00:37:18,555
- I'm here.
- And McClane?

534
00:37:18,955 --> 00:37:22,055
He's on his way. Uh, you know, he's
a little slow. He's kinda out of shape.

535
00:37:22,255 --> 00:37:26,755
The rules applied to both of you.
I'm afraid this is noncompliance.

536
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:28,955
Goodbye.

537
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:40,055
Trust me, guys. Duck.

538
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:19,756
Hey, get outta there!
Get outta there! Duck, asshole!

539
00:38:43,956 --> 00:38:45,756
Oh, my God!

540
00:39:11,556 --> 00:39:12,856
McClane?

541
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:21,156
What?

542
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:29,057
- You can see right down into the subway.
- How many fire trucks do you count?

543
00:39:29,357 --> 00:39:32,157
- You guys! You guys!
- How can you see it from up here?

544
00:39:32,957 --> 00:39:34,757
Damn! Get in there.

545
00:39:35,057 --> 00:39:38,757
Officer, tell those people
to get the hell back, will ya?

546
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:41,457
We got a shitload of cuts and bruises,
a couple concussions...

547
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:44,257
some old guy's pacemaker stopped,
and a pregnant girl's water broke.

548
00:39:44,557 --> 00:39:46,557
And that's all.
How're you doin', John?

549
00:39:46,857 --> 00:39:48,957
Still can't hear too good.

550
00:39:49,157 --> 00:39:52,157
Well, it's a miracle you're still alive.
It's a goddam miracle.

551
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,657
- Yeah, that's the problem, Joe.
- What?

552
00:39:54,857 --> 00:39:58,557
The miracle part. What are the odds
of us makin' it down here on time?

553
00:39:59,957 --> 00:40:02,057
- Zip.
- That bomb was gonna go off
no matter what.

554
00:40:02,357 --> 00:40:04,457
He wanted it to go off
right down here.

555
00:40:04,657 --> 00:40:07,057
Take this off me, Dave.

556
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:09,557
Well, what's so special
about this place?

557
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:12,257
- I don't know.
Something just doesn't add up.
- Lt McClane?

558
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:15,157
They're asking for you and a Mr Carver.

559
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,757
- Where?
- John?

560
00:40:21,757 --> 00:40:25,657
John, this is Andy Cross
with the FBI.

561
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,957
- This is Mr Jarvis. He's...
- I'm, uh, with another agency.

562
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:32,957
- It's good to meet you.
- This is Lt McClane.

563
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:35,957
This is Mr Carver.

564
00:40:36,257 --> 00:40:38,757
We've got
a couple of questions first.

565
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:41,158
Do you recognize this guy?

566
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:48,758
- No.
- How about this one?

567
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:55,458
How about you?

568
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:59,758
Did you recognize
the voice on the phone?

569
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,758
No.

570
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:04,558
Did you, uh, notice
any cars following you?

571
00:41:08,058 --> 00:41:10,558
- No.
- Anybody following you at all?

572
00:41:10,758 --> 00:41:13,258
Any kind of surveillance?
Telephone? House?

573
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:16,458
Anything unusual at all?

574
00:41:16,758 --> 00:41:21,158
Well, now that you mention it,
I have experienced a...

575
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:23,858
you know, like a burning sensation
between my toes.

576
00:41:24,058 --> 00:41:27,158
I thought it was just some athlete's
foot or something. I don't know.

577
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:34,058
We read your jacket, Lieutenant.
We were told you would be cooperative.

578
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,158
- Cooperate with what?
What do you mean cooperate?
- Hey, now wait a minute. He will be.

579
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,958
- We're wasting time
here in this goddam van.
- You wanna share information...

580
00:41:39,158 --> 00:41:40,958
how about sending
a little our way as well?

581
00:41:41,158 --> 00:41:43,358
- Look, we wanna hear
what he knows first.
- What the hell?

582
00:41:43,558 --> 00:41:46,158
- You give us pictures, and then you...
- Look, we want to hear
what he knows first.

583
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:48,558
Hey, I know as much as you know.
All right?

584
00:41:50,058 --> 00:41:52,559
There's a guy out there
settin' off bombs.

585
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:56,259
He calls himself Simon.
He speaks with a German accent.

586
00:41:56,459 --> 00:41:59,259
And, for some reason,
he's very angry with me.

587
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,159
Now, maybe you can tell me
why, fellas.

588
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:11,459
The first man there is Methias Targo.
Was Hungarian army.

589
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:14,259
Explosives expert. Now we believe
he's working for the Iranians.

590
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:18,459
- Working?
- Freelance terrorism, by contract.

591
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,959
- Who's the girl?
- Targo's other half.

592
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,559
Rumour is the Israelis slipped a bomb
in between their sheets.

593
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:28,359
Uh, he wasn't at home,
but they think maybe they got her.

594
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,659
The second man was an obscure colonel
in the East German army.

595
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:37,259
He ran an infiltration unit.
The kind of thing the Nazis did
at the Battle of the Bulge.

596
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:40,459
- English-speaking troops...
- Yeah, yeah, I saw the movie.

597
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:46,659
All we know of him is the G.D.R. medical
records show he suffers from migraines.

598
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:49,759
His name is Peter Krieg.

599
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:55,659
Well, that is
an exceptional report, fellas.

600
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:58,459
Now do you wanna tell me
what the hell this has to do with me?

601
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,259
The name Gruber mean anything
to you, Lieutenant?

602
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,360
- It rings a bell, yeah.
- LA.

603
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,460
- What?
- That thing in the building in LA.

604
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,960
Peter Krieg was born...

605
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,260
Simon Peter Gruber.

606
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,660
He's Hans Gruber's brother.

607
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:32,760
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, it's that thing in LA.

608
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,960
We figure he's got you
fitted up for a toe tag...

609
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,060
and he's gonna do anything
to get it tied.

610
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,960
Inspector!
Inspector, it's him!

611
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,960
Don't let him know we're here.

612
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,160
- Simon.
- Inspector.

613
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,160
Now, who from the FBI
is in the van, I wonder?

614
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,460
Let's see.
Almost certainly Cross.

615
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,260
- Come on, Andrew. Say hello.
- Hello.

616
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,660
And I know you never run alone,
so say hello, Bill.

617
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,060
Still trying to butch up
by chewing on your glasses, huh?

618
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,761
This, gentlemen, as they say,
is where the plot thickens.

619
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:16,261
I have put 2,400 pounds of explosive...

620
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:19,461
in one of the 1,446 schools
in greater New York.

621
00:44:19,861 --> 00:44:24,061
It is fitted with a timer
set to explode at exactly 3:00 pm.

622
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:28,061
Thank you.
Your silence says I'm understood.

623
00:44:28,261 --> 00:44:30,861
Did you say 2,400 pounds?

624
00:44:31,061 --> 00:44:32,861
Yes, but please
don't interrupt again.

625
00:44:33,161 --> 00:44:35,761
Simon says, if you attempt
to evacuate schools...

626
00:44:35,961 --> 00:44:37,861
the bomb will be detonated
by radio.

627
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:40,161
And, gentlemen,
someone will be watching.

628
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:44,261
Repeat, one school will be dismissed
at 3:00 pm, permanently.

629
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:46,261
- Unless...
- Unless what?

630
00:44:46,461 --> 00:44:50,161
Unless John McClane and his new best
friend complete the tasks I set them.

631
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:52,461
John, are you listening?

632
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:55,661
Yeah.

633
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:58,561
The pay phone beyond Hope,
Tomkins Square Park.

634
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:01,461
Twenty minutes.
Go by foot. No rush.

635
00:45:01,761 --> 00:45:05,661
If you're really clever,
you'll learn the location of the bomb
and the code to disarm it.

636
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:07,861
Oh, and by the way, gentlemen...

637
00:45:08,161 --> 00:45:10,961
we got something of a bargain
on radio detonators.

638
00:45:11,261 --> 00:45:13,461
The only problem is
the darn things seem to respond...

639
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:15,661
to police and FBI frequencies.

640
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:19,061
So, if I were you,
I'd keep off your radios.

641
00:45:19,361 --> 00:45:21,061
Simon, wait.

642
00:45:25,462 --> 00:45:28,262
Twenty-four hundred pounds
of that liquid stuff.

643
00:45:28,562 --> 00:45:31,662
My God.
Get me the commissioner.

644
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:34,562
He's doing a press conference. He's
supposed to be here in half an hour.

645
00:45:34,962 --> 00:45:37,962
All right, Ricky, get
every senior officer on the site
and get 'em here right away.

646
00:45:38,262 --> 00:45:40,362
You're not gonna give me
any jurisdictional nonsense on this?

647
00:45:40,662 --> 00:45:42,962
I got two kids
in the school on 64th Street.

648
00:45:44,662 --> 00:45:46,562
- What can I do to help you?
- How many men have you got?

649
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:49,962
Seventy-five. But if I push the panic
button, I can get 500 from Washington.

650
00:45:50,262 --> 00:45:52,362
- When?
- 2:30, 3:00.

651
00:45:52,562 --> 00:45:54,762
Between now and then...

652
00:45:55,062 --> 00:45:58,862
We're gonna have to do this
all by ourselves. Let's go.

653
00:45:59,162 --> 00:46:02,362
And Tomkins Square Park
is more than two miles away,
so you guys better get running.

654
00:46:02,562 --> 00:46:04,562
No radios.
You take my telephone.

655
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:08,162
You get anything, you call me
through the switchboard. Good luck.

656
00:46:08,362 --> 00:46:11,462
Thanks.
Find that bomb.

657
00:46:11,762 --> 00:46:13,562
- Ricky, where are they?
- Right over here.

658
00:46:13,862 --> 00:46:16,462
- The senior man present is Chief Allen.
- Chief of what?

659
00:46:16,662 --> 00:46:18,862
- Transit.
- Okay, thanks, Ricky.

660
00:46:19,062 --> 00:46:21,862
Gentlemen, we have a decision to make.
Chief Allen.

661
00:46:22,062 --> 00:46:24,562
The man who has done this
has told us that he has planted...

662
00:46:24,762 --> 00:46:29,362
another very large bomb in a school
here in the New York area.

663
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:33,962
And he has told us that we cannot
evacuate, but he has not said
that we cannot search.

664
00:46:34,262 --> 00:46:37,063
Now, I recommend we get everybody,
and I mean everybody...

665
00:46:37,263 --> 00:46:39,463
I'm talking about police,
transit, sanitation, fire...

666
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:41,463
even the goddam librarians...

667
00:46:41,763 --> 00:46:45,263
and we start searching schools,
and I mean right now.

668
00:46:45,563 --> 00:46:48,163
I'm talking about a thousand buildings
within the city limits...

669
00:46:48,363 --> 00:46:50,763
and we have three hours
and 15 minutes to do it in.

670
00:46:50,963 --> 00:46:53,663
Now, I'd like to keep the media
out of this as long as possible...

671
00:46:53,863 --> 00:46:56,663
because if they get in,
we've got a panic.

672
00:46:56,963 --> 00:46:58,663
Are we in agreement?

673
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:01,863
Come on, guys. Let's go!

674
00:47:02,163 --> 00:47:07,263
Move it out! Move it out!
No radio contact. No radio contact.

675
00:47:17,063 --> 00:47:21,763
They bought it.
You can begin.

676
00:47:36,963 --> 00:47:39,263
Hook, line...

677
00:47:42,363 --> 00:47:44,363
and sinker.

678
00:47:49,564 --> 00:47:51,964
All right now, men.
Let's go! Let's go!

679
00:47:55,064 --> 00:47:56,464
Let's go!

680
00:48:08,064 --> 00:48:10,764
- Hey, hold on. Let me go over there.
- I gotta get through!

681
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:29,064
Sergeant Turley!
Sergeant Turley!

682
00:48:29,264 --> 00:48:32,264
In the last five minutes, the volume
of calls in here has tripled!

683
00:48:32,464 --> 00:48:36,064
- What the hell is goin' on?
- Stop. Let me explain.

684
00:48:36,464 --> 00:48:39,564
For the rest of the day,
we're supposed to handle
the department's communications.

685
00:48:39,764 --> 00:48:41,664
What do you mean "handle"?

686
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:45,764
They're shutting down the police band.
All calls will be coming
through this switchboard.

687
00:48:46,064 --> 00:48:48,164
And I'm gonna marry Donald Trump!

688
00:48:48,464 --> 00:48:52,664
Walsh, what's going on?
Why'd everybody tear out of here?

689
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:56,664
Come on, Pamela. Look at your watch!
It's comin' up on shift change.

690
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:58,664
The bean counters are worried
about overtime...

691
00:48:58,964 --> 00:49:01,165
so we sent everybody back
to the precinct to punch out.

692
00:49:01,365 --> 00:49:04,965
- The next shift
is gonna be here in a minute.
- You are so full of shit, Walsh!

693
00:49:05,265 --> 00:49:07,065
Thank you.

694
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:16,365
What the hell?

695
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:32,965
Detective, Bob Thompson,
city engineer's office.

696
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:37,065
We'd like to get an idea
of the damage.

697
00:49:39,065 --> 00:49:42,065
Man, you guys really
got here fast.

698
00:49:43,265 --> 00:49:46,865
Well, it's Wall Street, sir.

699
00:49:47,265 --> 00:49:49,265
A lot of money here.

700
00:49:49,465 --> 00:49:54,065
A lot of opinion makers the mayor
doesn't wanna piss off, you know?

701
00:49:55,865 --> 00:49:57,665
Is this it?

702
00:50:00,265 --> 00:50:03,165
Holy Toledo!

703
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:06,265
Somebody had fun.

704
00:50:06,565 --> 00:50:10,465
I'd appreciate it if you'd show
my associates the way down.

705
00:50:12,566 --> 00:50:15,066
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Jimmy!

706
00:50:15,266 --> 00:50:19,066
You got the flashlight?
Murphy, come on, you too!

707
00:50:19,466 --> 00:50:21,566
- Rick Walsh.
- John Gunther.

708
00:50:21,866 --> 00:50:23,966
Come on, gentlemen. Let's go!

709
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,366
You were probably at the World Trades.
You know what that mess was.

710
00:51:03,466 --> 00:51:06,966
Please inform Mr Little
that Mr Vanderfloog is here.

711
00:51:07,266 --> 00:51:09,066
Mr Vanderfloog?

712
00:51:11,866 --> 00:51:13,966
There's a Mr Vanderfloog
for Mr Little.

713
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:31,567
Go down 20 metres! Come on!

714
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,767
- A lot of steam down here.
- Yeah, yeah. We snapped
a couple of the steam pipes.

715
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:38,767
It's like a sauna. We got the subway
guys to shut down the third rail.

716
00:51:39,067 --> 00:51:42,367
- It's on emergency lighting.
- Yeah, emergency lights, and
there's still some light... Hey!

717
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:46,267
No shooting!
Speak English!

718
00:51:46,467 --> 00:51:48,767
Otto doesn't speak English,
do you, Otto?

719
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:51,867
- Where the hell did we get this guy?
- He's one of Targo's thugs.

720
00:51:54,867 --> 00:51:57,467
Pull all the way up!
Pull all the way! Pull all the way!

721
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:07,067
So what's up with this LA thing?
You famous or somethin'?

722
00:52:07,267 --> 00:52:09,367
Yeah, for about five minutes.

723
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:12,067
- Don't tell me. Rodney King, right?
- Fuck you.

724
00:52:12,367 --> 00:52:14,567
- You know this guy Simon
we're talking to?
- Yeah.

725
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:18,467
I threw his little brother off the 32nd
floor of Nakatomi Towers out in LA.

726
00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:21,267
I guess he's a little
pissed off about it.

727
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:23,367
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me I'm in this shit...

728
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:26,567
'cause some white cop threw some
white asshole's brother off a roof?

729
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:14,768
Mr Vanderfloog?
Felix Little, corporate relations.

730
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:18,168
Sorry you had to wait, but apparently
there was an explosion in the subway.

731
00:53:18,368 --> 00:53:20,268
It's played hell
with our alarms, I'm afraid.

732
00:53:20,468 --> 00:53:24,168
- I trust there's nothing wrong.
- Oh, no. Good Lord, no. Safe and secure.

733
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:27,468
Now, you were concerned
about a currency exchange?

734
00:53:27,668 --> 00:53:30,668
W-We are not a commercial bank,
in the normal sense.

735
00:53:30,968 --> 00:53:33,468
We're... We're primarily...

736
00:53:33,768 --> 00:53:36,768
governments, central banks,
that sort of thing.

737
00:53:36,968 --> 00:53:39,068
- Apart from the depository, of course.
- Of course.

738
00:53:39,268 --> 00:53:42,668
Yeah. And you are in the flower
business, Mr Vanderfloog?

739
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:48,669
Back! Back! Come on!

740
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:15,469
Come on!

741
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:31,769
Oh, no, Mr Vanderfloog,
that's the vault elevator.

742
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:36,369
I'm sorry. Our alarms
are sonic and seismic...

743
00:54:36,669 --> 00:54:39,069
two things which, I'm afraid,
do not react well to explosions.

744
00:54:39,469 --> 00:54:43,269
You know, th-this subway business
has knocked all our systems
into a cocked hat.

745
00:54:43,469 --> 00:54:46,169
In fact, we've had to give up
and pull the plug on the whole thing.

746
00:54:46,469 --> 00:54:49,069
- The repair people are downstairs now.
- Good Lord!

747
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:52,769
Yes, yes. Heavens to Betsy!
If anyone knew!

748
00:54:57,169 --> 00:55:00,370
But I thought this was
a currency exchange.

749
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:03,870
Oh, I think we'll go straight
to the withdrawal.

750
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,770
Hey, Captain, you wanna come down here
and take a look at this?

751
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:57,270
Somethin's going on.

752
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,370
What do you think, guys?
You'll be able to fix that?

753
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,270
Just a minute now.

754
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,370
Okay, I'll be right back. Down!

755
00:56:12,471 --> 00:56:14,471
Stay back!

756
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:17,371
Stay back!

757
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:52,171
Come on. Come on. Shit.

758
00:57:02,571 --> 00:57:03,971
- Come on.
- Front desk.

759
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,871
Yes. Call the police. Get your ass
down here right now! I'm under attack!

760
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,971
Hey, just relax, mate.
Maybe you'll live through this.

761
00:57:10,271 --> 00:57:11,971
Shit!

762
00:57:34,072 --> 00:57:37,072
I think he's dead, my dear.

763
00:57:38,972 --> 00:57:41,172
All right.
Let's see to the office work.

764
00:58:01,472 --> 00:58:03,772
God! It's Fort Knox!

765
00:58:26,472 --> 00:58:29,672
$140 billion.

766
00:58:29,872 --> 00:58:31,872
Ten times what's in Kentucky.

767
00:58:33,073 --> 00:58:35,973
Fort Knox. Ha!
It's for tourists.

768
00:58:50,273 --> 00:58:52,273
Yeah. McClane.

769
00:58:52,473 --> 00:58:55,873
John, you're out of shape?
You barely made it.

770
00:58:56,273 --> 00:58:59,673
Yeah, well, we all barely make it.
What do you want us to do?

771
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:02,573
What has four legs
and is always ready to travel?

772
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:06,173
- What?
- What did he say?

773
00:59:06,573 --> 00:59:08,573
What has four legs
and is always ready to travel?

774
00:59:08,773 --> 00:59:12,273
What's the matter with you? Don't you
have kids? That's an elephant joke.

775
00:59:20,573 --> 00:59:22,573
That a bomb?

776
00:59:22,873 --> 00:59:25,573
- Yeah. Go, go ahead and grab it.
- No. You're the cop.

777
00:59:25,873 --> 00:59:28,373
- Man, Simon said you're supposed to be
helpin' with this.
- I'm helpin'.

778
00:59:28,673 --> 00:59:31,573
- Well, when're you gonna start helpin'?
- After you get the bomb.

779
00:59:49,274 --> 00:59:51,674
- Careful.
- I'm being careful.

780
00:59:51,974 --> 00:59:53,774
- Don't open it.
- What?

781
00:59:53,974 --> 00:59:56,674
I gotta open it.
Uh, it's gonna be all right.

782
01:00:09,274 --> 01:00:12,974
Shit! Shit!
I told you not to open it!

783
01:00:17,674 --> 01:00:19,774
I trust you see the message.

784
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:23,174
It has a proximity circuit,
so, please, don't run.

785
01:00:23,374 --> 01:00:26,474
Yeah, I got it. We're not gonna run.
How do we turn this thing off?

786
01:00:26,774 --> 01:00:29,874
On the fountain there should be
two jugs. Do you see them?

787
01:00:30,174 --> 01:00:32,474
A five-gallon and a three-gallon.

788
01:00:32,774 --> 01:00:36,474
Fill one of the jugs
with exactly four gallons of water...

789
01:00:36,774 --> 01:00:40,074
and place it on the scale
and the timer will stop.

790
01:00:40,274 --> 01:00:44,674
You must be precise. One ounce more
or less will result in detonation.

791
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,874
If you're still alive in five minutes,
we'll speak then.

792
01:00:47,074 --> 01:00:48,874
Wait! Wait a sec...

793
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,674
- I don't get it. Do you get it?
- No.

794
01:00:56,975 --> 01:00:58,775
Get the jugs.

795
01:01:00,575 --> 01:01:03,675
Obviously, we can't fill
the three-gallon jug with
four gallons of water, right?

796
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:06,375
- Obviously.
- All right. I know. Here we go.

797
01:01:06,675 --> 01:01:09,375
We fill the three-gallon jug
exactly to the top, right?

798
01:01:09,675 --> 01:01:12,675
Okay. Now, we pour that three gallons
into the five-gallon jug...

799
01:01:13,075 --> 01:01:15,575
giving us exactly three gallons
in the five-gallon jug, right?

800
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:19,675
- Right. Then what?
- Okay. Now, take the three-gallon jug,
fill that a third of the way up...

801
01:01:20,075 --> 01:01:22,375
- No, no, no. He said be precise.
Exactly four gallons.
- Shit!

802
01:01:22,575 --> 01:01:26,175
Every cop in 50 miles is runnin'
his ass off, and I'm out here
playin' kids games in a park.

803
01:01:28,275 --> 01:01:30,775
You wanna focus
on the problem at hand?

804
01:01:47,075 --> 01:01:49,675
I thought you said you knew! You said
don't say anything if you don't know!

805
01:01:49,975 --> 01:01:51,675
I thought you said... Gimme the fuckin'
jug. We're startin' over.

806
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:53,775
- No! We can't start over!
We can't start over!
- Pour that out! We're startin' over!

807
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:56,475
- We can't start over.
- Gimme the fuckin' jug, or I'm gonna put
my foot up your ass, you dumb mother...

808
01:01:56,775 --> 01:01:59,375
- Say it! Say it!
- What?

809
01:01:59,575 --> 01:02:01,375
- You were gonna call me
a nigger, weren't you?
- No, I wasn't!

810
01:02:01,575 --> 01:02:03,975
- Yes, you were.
What were you gonna call me?
- Asshole!

811
01:02:04,275 --> 01:02:05,775
How's that, asshole?

812
01:02:05,975 --> 01:02:07,876
You got some fuckin' problem
with me 'cause I'm white, Zeus?

813
01:02:08,076 --> 01:02:11,776
Is that it? Have I oppressed you?
Have I oppressed your people somehow?

814
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:14,776
I'll tell you what your problem is. You
don't like me 'cause you're a racist!

815
01:02:15,076 --> 01:02:17,176
- What?
- You're a racist.
You don't like me 'cause I'm white.

816
01:02:17,476 --> 01:02:20,176
I don't like you
because you're gonna get me killed!

817
01:02:20,376 --> 01:02:22,176
How much time?
Aw, shit!

818
01:02:22,376 --> 01:02:24,376
We got less than a minute.
Throw this thing away.

819
01:02:24,576 --> 01:02:26,376
No, we can't take it off of there.
It'll detonate. Just, wait.

820
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,876
Wait a second. Wait a second.

821
01:02:30,376 --> 01:02:32,476
I got it! I got it!
Exactly two gallons in here, right?

822
01:02:32,676 --> 01:02:35,076
- Right.
- Leaving exactly one gallon
of empty space, right?

823
01:02:35,276 --> 01:02:37,176
- Yeah.
- A full five gallons here, right?

824
01:02:37,376 --> 01:02:39,676
- Right.
- If you pour one gallon out of the five
gallons into there we have exactly...

825
01:02:39,976 --> 01:02:42,976
- Four gallons in there!
- Yes!
- Pour it in there! Come on!

826
01:02:43,376 --> 01:02:45,276
Come on!

827
01:02:45,576 --> 01:02:47,776
Don't spill. Don't spill it!

828
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:50,676
- Good, good, good! Exactly four gallons.
- You did it, McClane.

829
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:53,676
- Put it on the thing!
Get it down there!
- Oh, shit.

830
01:03:01,776 --> 01:03:04,876
Congratulations.
You're still alive.

831
01:03:05,276 --> 01:03:07,176
Congratulations.

832
01:03:07,376 --> 01:03:10,776
- Yeah, we did it.
- You surprise me again, John.

833
01:03:10,976 --> 01:03:12,876
This is becoming an ugly habit.

834
01:03:13,176 --> 01:03:16,076
Yeah, well, I don't have the time
right now, Simon. Listen.

835
01:03:16,276 --> 01:03:18,577
Deal's a deal.
Where's the school bomb?

836
01:03:18,777 --> 01:03:21,677
On the contrary,
you have lots of time.

837
01:03:21,977 --> 01:03:23,977
You have...

838
01:03:24,177 --> 01:03:26,977
two hours and 47 minutes precisely.

839
01:03:27,377 --> 01:03:29,677
Plenty of time
to test those wits of yours.

840
01:03:29,977 --> 01:03:32,077
Hey! Hey! Hey, listen, jerk-off!

841
01:03:32,277 --> 01:03:34,877
Let me tell you somethin'!
I got a bad fuckin' hangover, all right?

842
01:03:35,177 --> 01:03:37,777
And I'm a little sick of these fuckin'
riddles! Now, where is the school bomb?

843
01:03:37,977 --> 01:03:42,277
Temper, John.
The road to truth has many turns.

844
01:03:42,577 --> 01:03:45,877
You will find an envelope
under the rim of the fountain.

845
01:03:46,177 --> 01:03:50,177
When you undertake the trip it suggests,
ask yourself this question:

846
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:54,077
What is 21 out of 42?

847
01:03:56,377 --> 01:03:58,777
We're behind.
We should abandon the rest and go.

848
01:03:58,977 --> 01:04:01,977
Relax, Targo.
There's not a cop for 20 blocks.

849
01:04:02,177 --> 01:04:06,477
He's sending us to the home team dugout
at Yankee Stadium. Why?

850
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:09,077
Well, we're the home team. Are we
supposed to find something there?

851
01:04:09,377 --> 01:04:11,177
What's 21 out of 42?

852
01:04:11,377 --> 01:04:14,577
Twenty-one again.
Half of 42. Forty-two what?

853
01:04:14,877 --> 01:04:17,677
- How many players
are on the Yankees ball club?
- Twenty-five.

854
01:04:17,977 --> 01:04:21,377
- What else is 21? Blackjack.
- It's a club.

855
01:04:21,677 --> 01:04:24,077
It's a wild goose chase,
is what it is.

856
01:04:28,277 --> 01:04:30,378
Where's the nearest "A" train?

857
01:04:30,578 --> 01:04:32,378
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

858
01:04:32,478 --> 01:04:34,578
You know,
some kid might find that.

859
01:04:36,378 --> 01:04:38,178
You're right.

860
01:04:43,778 --> 01:04:46,178
Come back here!
You little sons of bitches!

861
01:04:46,378 --> 01:04:48,978
Hey, you! I remember you!

862
01:04:50,578 --> 01:04:52,378
Hey, hey, hey. Where're you going?
Come here. What are you doin'?

863
01:04:52,678 --> 01:04:54,778
- What are you doin'?
- Let me go! Let me go, dick-head.

864
01:04:55,078 --> 01:04:56,478
Watch your mouth.

865
01:04:56,578 --> 01:04:59,678
You wanna go down to juvenile hall
for a Butterfinger? Is that it?

866
01:04:59,978 --> 01:05:02,678
Look around, man.
All the cops are into somethin'.

867
01:05:02,878 --> 01:05:04,878
It's Christmas.
You could steal City Hall.

868
01:05:12,278 --> 01:05:13,978
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.
- My bike.

869
01:05:14,178 --> 01:05:16,378
- Yo, that's my bike!
- Yeah. It's Christmas.

870
01:05:16,578 --> 01:05:20,678
- Hey, hey, hey! Where're you going?
Yankee Stadium's that way!
- That's my bike, you asshole!

871
01:05:27,478 --> 01:05:30,378
Why don't you just run over everybody
in the whole street?

872
01:05:30,578 --> 01:05:32,978
McClane, what the fuck
are we doin' back down here?

873
01:05:33,178 --> 01:05:35,778
Let me ask you somethin'. What is it
that Wall Street doesn't have?

874
01:05:36,078 --> 01:05:37,878
What, is this stuff catchin'?
You're talkin' in riddles.

875
01:05:38,078 --> 01:05:40,478
- No, no. Stay with me. What is it
that Wall Street does not have?
- What?

876
01:05:40,778 --> 01:05:43,779
Schools. And what is it
they have a shitload of?

877
01:05:44,179 --> 01:05:46,079
What?

878
01:05:53,479 --> 01:05:56,679
- I'll be back in a minute.
- What am I supposed to do with this?

879
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:00,279
Give it to those guys over there.

880
01:06:00,479 --> 01:06:01,579
He's here.

881
01:06:01,879 --> 01:06:03,779
Perhaps you could be
a little more specific.

882
01:06:03,979 --> 01:06:07,979
McClane is here.
He's walking toward the bank.

883
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,679
And the black man
is coming toward me.

884
01:06:11,979 --> 01:06:14,679
Oh, now that's a pity.

885
01:06:14,979 --> 01:06:17,279
And after we've gone to all
that trouble at the stadium.

886
01:06:17,479 --> 01:06:19,579
Simon, kill him.

887
01:06:19,779 --> 01:06:22,279
Stop toying with him
and kill him now.

888
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:25,579
Okay. So be it.

889
01:06:25,879 --> 01:06:30,679
May he rest in peace.
I'll inform Karl in the lobby.

890
01:06:30,979 --> 01:06:33,779
- You pack up your team
and get out of there.
- And this one?

891
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:36,779
Officer.

892
01:06:39,179 --> 01:06:41,679
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm afraid
I'm gonna need an answer on that issue.

893
01:06:47,179 --> 01:06:50,679
- Let him go.
- Understood. Yes, sir?

894
01:06:50,879 --> 01:06:53,480
John McClane says to give you this.

895
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,580
Wait, wait. Jesus, don't open it.
It's a bomb.

896
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,280
- Another?
- Yeah.

897
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:02,280
Oh, I see. Um, oh,
we'll take care of that.

898
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,780
We better move now. Sir,
thank you so much for your assistance.

899
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,280
We really appreciate it.
Thank you.

900
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,280
What are you doing?

901
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:19,680
- I don't want to ride with it.
- Some kid could...

902
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,980
Put it in the back.

903
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:31,080
Hey! Y-You, you,
leavin' this place unguarded?

904
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,980
I understand.

905
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,580
- How ya doin'?
- All right.

906
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,280
John McClane. NYPD.

907
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:02,080
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. It's laundry day.

908
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,481
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?

909
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,081
Has it been quiet like this
all morning here?

910
01:08:08,281 --> 01:08:11,481
- Well...
- Except for that big explosion
a couple of hours ago.

911
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:14,681
I mean, have you seen anything strange
happen in the last hour or so?

912
01:08:14,881 --> 01:08:18,081
No. And we've had cops in here
pretty steady since the subway thing.

913
01:08:18,481 --> 01:08:20,081
Yeah.

914
01:08:20,281 --> 01:08:22,981
We were just gonna make a round on
the vault floor, if you wanna tag along.

915
01:08:23,281 --> 01:08:25,681
Sure. Yeah. I think I will.

916
01:08:25,981 --> 01:08:28,081
Now, what do you think of this heat
this late in the year?

917
01:08:28,381 --> 01:08:29,981
Eh, Indian summer, huh?

918
01:08:30,181 --> 01:08:33,381
Yeah, it feels like it's gonna rain
like dogs and cats later.

919
01:08:33,681 --> 01:08:37,781
- Here's one of your guys.
- Detective, uh, Otto, isn't it?

920
01:08:38,081 --> 01:08:39,881
John McClane.

921
01:08:42,681 --> 01:08:44,381
Hey, Mike. How ya doin'?

922
01:08:46,681 --> 01:08:50,281
I keep tellin' myself I'm gonna
take the stairs just for the exercise.

923
01:08:50,681 --> 01:08:52,581
And on a hot day like this.

924
01:08:52,881 --> 01:08:55,581
But it seems like I always end up
riding the lift.

925
01:09:22,782 --> 01:09:24,782
Hey, what was the lottery number
last night?

926
01:09:24,982 --> 01:09:28,082
Any of you guys
play the lottery? No?

927
01:09:28,382 --> 01:09:31,282
Ah, my wife buys me two tickets
every week.

928
01:09:31,482 --> 01:09:33,482
For the last ten years,
plays the same two numbers all the time.

929
01:09:33,682 --> 01:09:35,482
I said, "Honey, why don't you play
a different number?"

930
01:09:35,782 --> 01:09:38,182
She goes,
"Well, those are my lucky numbers."

931
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:40,482
I got the tickets right here.

932
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:46,082
Put that fuckin' gun down!
Put that fuckin' gun down now!

933
01:09:53,082 --> 01:09:54,882
Put it down!

934
01:10:00,382 --> 01:10:02,382
Hello!

935
01:10:02,582 --> 01:10:04,682
Anybody down here?

936
01:10:15,082 --> 01:10:16,982
- Put your hands up!
Put your fuckin' hands up now!
- No, no, no!

937
01:10:17,282 --> 01:10:19,682
John, no!
No! God, it's me! It's me!

938
01:10:22,182 --> 01:10:24,882
- Jesus Christ,
you almost gave me a heart attack.
- You all right?

939
01:10:25,082 --> 01:10:26,482
You all right?

940
01:10:26,582 --> 01:10:28,683
- Yeah, yeah. It's not my blood.
- What the hell's goin' on down here?

941
01:10:28,983 --> 01:10:30,683
Go take a look in there.

942
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,583
Hey, McClane.
Where the hell is everybody?

943
01:10:57,783 --> 01:10:59,683
Simon fuckin' says!

944
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:04,383
I should've seen it comin' a mile away.
This was never about revenge.

945
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:07,583
- It's about a goddam heist.
- Wh-Wh-What was in the room?

946
01:11:07,883 --> 01:11:11,283
- This.
- What is this?

947
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:13,883
- Oh, shit! Is this gold?
- Yeah, it's gold.

948
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:16,983
Damn, this is heavy!
They cleaned out a whole room of this?

949
01:11:17,183 --> 01:11:21,183
- Yeah.
- You know, that would've taken
like a, a, a, a tank, or a, or a, a...

950
01:11:21,483 --> 01:11:23,683
A dump truck.

951
01:11:23,883 --> 01:11:25,883
Fourteen great big dump trucks.

952
01:11:26,183 --> 01:11:28,283
- We almost got hit by a dump truck.
- Shit!

953
01:11:28,483 --> 01:11:30,983
- Damn. Slow down! Shit!
- Put that shit down.

954
01:11:31,183 --> 01:11:33,183
- No fuckin' way.
- They ain't gonna let you keep it.

955
01:11:33,383 --> 01:11:35,483
- Yeah, yeah, we'll see.
- We're gonna need a car.

956
01:11:35,783 --> 01:11:37,283
A car?

957
01:11:42,684 --> 01:11:45,984
- You know how to hot-wire this thing?
- Of course I can. I'm an electrician.

958
01:11:46,184 --> 01:11:47,984
Only problem is...

959
01:11:51,784 --> 01:11:53,784
takes too fuckin' long.

960
01:12:06,084 --> 01:12:09,884
- Not on the bridge!
- Down there, McClane. The FDR.

961
01:12:13,284 --> 01:12:15,084
Let's go, let's go. Come on!

962
01:12:16,584 --> 01:12:19,084
- Oh, shit!
- What?

963
01:12:19,384 --> 01:12:21,784
- They shot the phone.
- Oh, too bad.

964
01:12:22,084 --> 01:12:24,584
- Come on. What's 21 out of 42?
- I don't have a clue.

965
01:12:24,884 --> 01:12:28,584
- Well, what about Yankee stadium?
- We'll get there, but that son of
a bitch is not gettin' off of Manhattan.

966
01:12:28,784 --> 01:12:30,584
- Move!
- Jesus Christ!

967
01:12:30,784 --> 01:12:32,284
Who do you think you are, lady,
Hillary Clinton?

968
01:12:32,484 --> 01:12:34,184
- That's it! Hillary Clinton.
- What?

969
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:36,984
- The 42nd president.
- No. She'd be the 43rd president.

970
01:12:37,184 --> 01:12:41,184
- All right, all right.
But who's the 21 st?
- I don't know.

971
01:12:41,584 --> 01:12:43,384
- You don't know?
- No, I don't know! Do you know?

972
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,384
- No!
- Well?

973
01:12:45,684 --> 01:12:47,684
What kind of engine does this piece
of shit have? Come on, step on it!

974
01:12:47,884 --> 01:12:50,985
It's a Yugo. It's built
for economy, not speed.

975
01:12:53,585 --> 01:12:55,885
- What are you doin'?
- I'm gonna get us another phone.

976
01:12:59,285 --> 01:13:01,685
Wait, wait, wait!

977
01:13:01,885 --> 01:13:05,085
- Hey, who was the 21 st president?
- Go fuck yourself!

978
01:13:07,385 --> 01:13:10,885
- That guy was pissed.
- He'll feel better
when he looks in the back seat.

979
01:13:11,285 --> 01:13:13,185
Oh, shit.
That was my gold bar!

980
01:13:13,385 --> 01:13:15,885
This is McClane.
Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.

981
01:13:16,085 --> 01:13:19,285
- John, where the hell are you?
- Walter, it's not a revenge.
It's a heist.

982
01:13:19,585 --> 01:13:22,885
- What?
- There's gold in the Federal Reserve,
and they took a shitload of it.

983
01:13:23,285 --> 01:13:26,685
- They're headed north in dump trucks.
- Have you been drinking, McClane?

984
01:13:26,885 --> 01:13:28,685
No, not since this morning.

985
01:13:28,885 --> 01:13:31,685
Listen. There's a line of dump trucks
northbound on the FDR at about 70th.

986
01:13:31,885 --> 01:13:34,385
You gotta close the bridge and get some
helicopters over there right away.

987
01:13:34,585 --> 01:13:36,685
I couldn't close a hot dog stand
right now.

988
01:13:36,985 --> 01:13:39,785
I'm spread all over hell.
What about this damn bomb?

989
01:13:40,085 --> 01:13:42,585
Find out who the 21 st president was.
It's got somethin' to do with this.

990
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,485
John! John, the 21 st what?

991
01:13:44,585 --> 01:13:48,385
Walter! Shit!
Goddam cellular fuckin' phones!

992
01:13:48,785 --> 01:13:50,485
- Get hold of Munson in Triborough.
- Inspector.

993
01:13:50,785 --> 01:13:53,585
Tell him to close all the East River
bridges north of 59th Street.

994
01:13:53,885 --> 01:13:55,685
- Lookin' for dump trucks.
- Dump trucks?

995
01:13:55,985 --> 01:13:59,685
McClane says there are dump trucks
headed up the FDR loaded with gold.

996
01:13:59,985 --> 01:14:03,086
Walter, they don't allow
dump trucks on the FDR!

997
01:14:03,386 --> 01:14:05,386
- Connie!
- All right.
You don't want I should argue.

998
01:14:05,686 --> 01:14:07,986
I won't argue,
no matter how stupid it is.

999
01:14:08,186 --> 01:14:10,986
K-9, bring it around to the back.
Check out the boiler room.

1000
01:14:11,286 --> 01:14:12,986
Find anything, Charlie?

1001
01:14:13,186 --> 01:14:16,286
I could spend a week in here with
an X-ray machine and still not find it.

1002
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:19,786
You don't have a week, Charlie.
You got five more minutes. Then
we're movin' up to 86th Street.

1003
01:14:19,986 --> 01:14:22,186
We're goin' as fast as we can.

1004
01:14:22,486 --> 01:14:23,886
What's up?

1005
01:14:24,186 --> 01:14:27,486
McClane was mentioning something
about the Federal Reserve Building.

1006
01:14:27,786 --> 01:14:31,186
- Isn't that right near that Wall Street
bomb site we just left?
- Yeah.

1007
01:14:37,586 --> 01:14:39,686
How long do you want us
to stay here?

1008
01:14:39,986 --> 01:14:42,386
The men at the stadium.
Stay or go?

1009
01:14:42,586 --> 01:14:44,786
Karl should have checked in by now.

1010
01:14:44,986 --> 01:14:46,986
Moment.

1011
01:14:54,186 --> 01:14:56,186
Come on. Come on.

1012
01:14:57,586 --> 01:15:00,686
Stay where you are.
McClane may still turn up.

1013
01:15:01,986 --> 01:15:05,486
Relax, Targo.
If he is still alive...

1014
01:15:05,886 --> 01:15:08,186
he won't be talking to anyone.

1015
01:15:08,386 --> 01:15:09,686
It's the next turn-off.

1016
01:15:11,186 --> 01:15:13,286
Hi. It's Elvis Duran.
You're on the air. What's up?

1017
01:15:13,486 --> 01:15:16,387
First of all, I just wanna tell you
what a great show you got.

1018
01:15:16,687 --> 01:15:19,387
- I listen to you all the time.
- Thank you. Thank you.
What do you wanna talk about?

1019
01:15:19,687 --> 01:15:22,587
Well, you know all those cop cars
screamin'around everywhere?

1020
01:15:22,987 --> 01:15:26,187
You know what they're up to?
There's a bomb in a school.

1021
01:15:26,387 --> 01:15:28,587
- My cousin's a cop.
- Here you go, my dear.

1022
01:15:28,787 --> 01:15:31,087
Somebody put a big bomb
in a school somewhere.

1023
01:15:31,387 --> 01:15:33,587
- Seven. Five.
- Only they don't know which one.

1024
01:15:33,887 --> 01:15:35,787
- 207...
- So they're searching all of them.

1025
01:15:35,987 --> 01:15:38,887
- Shh. Shh.
- Every school in the metropolitan area.

1026
01:15:39,187 --> 01:15:41,287
Holy shit.

1027
01:15:41,487 --> 01:15:42,787
- Doris!
- Annie?

1028
01:15:43,087 --> 01:15:44,087
Doris, can you get ahold
of my wife?

1029
01:15:45,387 --> 01:15:49,487
Turley! Half the goddam city
just called 9-1-1!

1030
01:15:52,387 --> 01:15:54,087
- They're gone.
- What?

1031
01:15:54,287 --> 01:15:56,387
- They're gone!
- Who is this guy, Houdini?

1032
01:15:56,487 --> 01:15:58,587
Shit! Down there! Down there!

1033
01:16:00,587 --> 01:16:04,087
- This thing got air bags?
- Your side does. I don't know about my...

1034
01:16:05,387 --> 01:16:07,187
McClane!

1035
01:16:27,288 --> 01:16:29,088
In the truck,
let me see the hands.

1036
01:16:30,588 --> 01:16:32,288
Put 'em on the door!

1037
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:38,688
Don't kill me! Don't shoot me!

1038
01:16:40,388 --> 01:16:42,188
- You a truck driver?
- No, I'm a beautician.

1039
01:16:42,388 --> 01:16:44,688
Of course I'm a truck driver!

1040
01:16:45,988 --> 01:16:49,088
- Where are you takin' this truck?
- The aqueduct.

1041
01:16:49,388 --> 01:16:51,088
What are you takin' a dump truck
to the race track for?

1042
01:16:51,288 --> 01:16:55,888
- No, the aqueduct. The aque...
The water aqueduct!
- Aqueduct?

1043
01:16:58,588 --> 01:17:02,788
See? Goes from here all the way up
to the Catskill Mountains.

1044
01:17:03,188 --> 01:17:04,988
- What does?
- That! The water pipe!

1045
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:07,388
Goes for about 60 miles.

1046
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:15,888
- Hey, you the foreman?
- Yeah.

1047
01:17:16,088 --> 01:17:20,488
NYPD. You had any, like,
extra dump trucks come through here
in the last couple of minutes?

1048
01:17:20,788 --> 01:17:22,588
I'm gonna write
those fuckin' clowns up.

1049
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,988
They better start
payin' attention to work orders,
or we're gonna kick some butt.

1050
01:17:25,288 --> 01:17:28,388
- Who? Who are you talkin' about?
- Ah, the dozen idiots
who tore ass up the tube!

1051
01:17:28,588 --> 01:17:31,488
We're not loadin' up there any more.
We're loadin' over here.

1052
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:33,688
So much for bridges and helicopters.

1053
01:17:33,988 --> 01:17:35,788
You got a map that shows me
where this tunnel goes?

1054
01:17:36,088 --> 01:17:37,789
Yeah. Right here.

1055
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:43,289
We run pretty much up
under the Saw Mill
till you get up to the Coffer Dam.

1056
01:17:43,589 --> 01:17:46,289
From there on, we've already brought
the water down from the reservoir.

1057
01:17:46,589 --> 01:17:50,689
- Anybody get in or outta there?
- Yeah. There's a vent shaft
every two miles.

1058
01:17:50,989 --> 01:17:52,389
- No. I mean with a truck.
- At the Coffer Dam.

1059
01:17:52,589 --> 01:17:54,889
You can get a truck in there.
You can get there on the surface.

1060
01:17:55,089 --> 01:17:58,189
Just follow the Saw Mill River Parkway
up there. It's about 20 miles.

1061
01:17:58,489 --> 01:18:00,289
All right. I'm gonna meet you
right there, all right?

1062
01:18:00,489 --> 01:18:01,989
Wait, wait!
Wh-What am I supposed to do?

1063
01:18:02,189 --> 01:18:05,089
- You're gonna go up to Yankee Stadium.
- McClane!

1064
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,189
Go! Get outta here.
We got less than two hours.

1065
01:18:07,389 --> 01:18:09,189
Goddam it!

1066
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:16,589
Hey! Is somethin' wrong?

1067
01:18:16,889 --> 01:18:19,189
480 yards of rock moved so far.

1068
01:18:19,489 --> 01:18:21,389
Now, that's ten times
the Hoover Dam.

1069
01:18:21,689 --> 01:18:25,489
Right now, there's 516 feet of rock
above our heads.

1070
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:28,389
This part is phase three
of tunnel three.

1071
01:18:28,689 --> 01:18:31,589
Planning for it began
back in 1954...

1072
01:18:31,789 --> 01:18:34,489
but construction didn't begin
till June of 1970.

1073
01:18:34,689 --> 01:18:37,089
You know what the most interesting part
of tunnel three is?

1074
01:18:37,289 --> 01:18:39,689
- What's that, Jerry?
- The valves. Each one...

1075
01:18:46,589 --> 01:18:50,890
A big departure
from tunnels one and two.

1076
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:54,490
Come on! What a hell of a place
to break down.

1077
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:57,390
Hold it a minute, Jerry.
Let me have your hard hat.

1078
01:18:57,790 --> 01:19:00,390
- You got a jacket?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.

1079
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:02,690
Wait here a minute.

1080
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:05,390
Wait until he gets
alongside the door.

1081
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:08,890
Hey, fellas.
Mickey O'Brian, aqueduct security.

1082
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:12,090
Hey, listen. We got a report of a guy
comin' through here with eight reindeer.

1083
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:24,490
Yeah, they said he was a jolly, old,
fat guy with a snowy-white beard.

1084
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:27,390
Cute little red and white suit.
I'm surprised you didn't see him.

1085
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:33,290
What is it with you guys
and these phones?

1086
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:37,190
This'll give me somethin'.

1087
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:40,490
Holy shit! Is that guy dead?

1088
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:44,590
- Yes, Jerry. I'm afraid he is.
- Jesus Christ.

1089
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:47,990
Yeah. I want you to get ahold
of a guy named Cobb.

1090
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:51,690
Walter Cobb. C-O-B-B.
He's the head of my police unit.

1091
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:55,390
Get him down here. Find him.
Tell him you were with John McClane.

1092
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:59,490
- Tell him to find out
who the 21 st president was.
- Chester A. Arthur.

1093
01:20:00,891 --> 01:20:03,991
- What?
- Chester A. Arthur. 1881 to 1885.

1094
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:06,491
Nominated vice president in 1880.

1095
01:20:06,691 --> 01:20:09,591
Did you know he was the collector
of customs right here in New York?

1096
01:20:09,791 --> 01:20:11,791
No, I didn't know that, Jerry.

1097
01:20:12,091 --> 01:20:13,791
Take care of yourself.

1098
01:20:43,591 --> 01:20:45,691
Now?

1099
01:20:45,991 --> 01:20:49,391
No, there's only one of them.

1100
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:05,591
Yes or no?

1101
01:21:07,991 --> 01:21:08,891
Yes or no?

1102
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:15,092
No.
We need the other one too.

1103
01:21:17,992 --> 01:21:20,692
TV's got us. TV's got us.
We gotta release these traffic guys.

1104
01:21:20,992 --> 01:21:22,592
No. Traffic jams
we can take care of later.

1105
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:25,092
- You find out what the hell
is wrong with this thing!
- Frequencies are jammed.

1106
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:27,192
- What about Ricky?
- I don't know.
I can't get ahold of him.

1107
01:21:27,392 --> 01:21:29,392
- But, Walter, Federal Reserve.
- Yeah?

1108
01:21:29,592 --> 01:21:31,892
Biggest gold storage
in the world.

1109
01:21:34,292 --> 01:21:37,392
You get a unit back down there.
Find Ricky. Find out what the hell
is goin' on.

1110
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:38,892
- Walter!
- Yeah?

1111
01:21:39,192 --> 01:21:40,892
You gotta hear this.

1112
01:21:44,992 --> 01:21:47,092
Christ, I thought we were
going in the back way.

1113
01:21:47,292 --> 01:21:49,992
This is the back way, Walter.

1114
01:21:50,192 --> 01:21:53,092
In half an hour, you're gonna have
a riot at every school in this city.

1115
01:21:59,692 --> 01:22:02,292
We'll start at the top floor.
Put 20 men on each floor.

1116
01:22:02,592 --> 01:22:04,792
Send the other 50 men
down to the basement with us.

1117
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:06,992
- What about McClane?
- Not a word. I'm gettin' nothin'.

1118
01:22:07,192 --> 01:22:09,092
- Busy signals.
- Westchester's probably worse
than we are.

1119
01:22:09,392 --> 01:22:11,592
This is kinda puttin' all our eggs
in one basket, isn't it?

1120
01:22:11,792 --> 01:22:13,892
- I mean, what if McClane's wrong?
- Walter?
- Yeah?

1121
01:22:14,092 --> 01:22:16,592
This is Principal Martinez.
Principal Martinez, Inspector Cobb.

1122
01:22:16,792 --> 01:22:19,192
- How do you do, Inspector?
- How do you do, Principal Martinez?

1123
01:22:19,492 --> 01:22:23,693
I don't want to alarm your children.
I wonder if you could move them all
into the auditorium and keep them calm.

1124
01:22:42,593 --> 01:22:45,593
We are coming to the dam.
You can call the rear guard.

1125
01:22:50,993 --> 01:22:53,193
Rear guard, you can close up now.

1126
01:22:55,093 --> 01:22:57,593
We've reached the dam.
You can come up now.

1127
01:22:59,193 --> 01:23:02,793
Nils, you can close in now.

1128
01:23:03,093 --> 01:23:06,393
- Nils!
- Attention, attention. Nils is dead.

1129
01:23:06,693 --> 01:23:09,993
I repeat, Nils is dead, fuck-head.
So is his pal.

1130
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:12,493
And those four guys
from the East German all-stars...

1131
01:23:12,693 --> 01:23:14,393
your boys down at the bank...

1132
01:23:14,593 --> 01:23:16,493
they're gonna be a little late.

1133
01:23:16,693 --> 01:23:19,293
John.

1134
01:23:19,493 --> 01:23:24,793
In the back of the truck you're driving,
there's $13 billion worth
in gold bullion.

1135
01:23:25,193 --> 01:23:28,293
- I wonder, would a deal
be out of the question?
- Yeah, I got a deal for ya.

1136
01:23:28,593 --> 01:23:32,193
Crawl out from under that rock
you're hidin' under, and I'll drive
this truck up your ass.

1137
01:23:33,593 --> 01:23:34,894
How colourful.

1138
01:23:40,994 --> 01:23:43,094
I told you not to toy with him.

1139
01:23:43,394 --> 01:23:45,194
Thank you. That's very helpful.

1140
01:23:48,594 --> 01:23:51,294
You've jeopardized the mission
and the contract.

1141
01:23:53,994 --> 01:23:55,794
We are vulnerable
till we reach the ship.

1142
01:23:55,994 --> 01:23:57,794
I'm going to put an end to this.

1143
01:24:00,294 --> 01:24:02,394
Stop!

1144
01:24:04,594 --> 01:24:06,394
Targo! Targo!

1145
01:24:06,694 --> 01:24:08,394
Here! Come here!

1146
01:24:10,194 --> 01:24:12,194
- We blow the dam.
- What?

1147
01:24:12,294 --> 01:24:13,694
We drown him.

1148
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:27,094
Walter!

1149
01:24:27,294 --> 01:24:30,094
Take a look at this. The janitor said
this one was delivered this morning.

1150
01:24:30,394 --> 01:24:33,994
About 10:30, right?
Not hooked up.

1151
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:36,894
- Yeah?
- Okay. Now take a look at the front.

1152
01:24:40,394 --> 01:24:42,494
We drill the hinges.
Get everybody out.

1153
01:27:13,397 --> 01:27:15,397
McClane!

1154
01:27:17,497 --> 01:27:18,897
- McClane!
- Where are you?

1155
01:27:19,097 --> 01:27:20,597
Over here!

1156
01:27:20,897 --> 01:27:23,197
You got a hell of a way
of flaggin' somebody down!

1157
01:27:23,397 --> 01:27:25,597
- You all right?
- Did you go to Yankee Stadium?

1158
01:27:25,797 --> 01:27:28,197
- Yeah! There's nobody there!
- You didn't see nobody?

1159
01:27:28,397 --> 01:27:30,597
- No!
- Nobody was followin' you?

1160
01:27:30,897 --> 01:27:32,897
I'm tellin' you.
He's jerkin' us around.

1161
01:27:33,097 --> 01:27:34,897
Oh, shit! Jesus!
Come on! Come on!

1162
01:27:34,997 --> 01:27:36,397
"Oh, no! I didn't see nobody.

1163
01:27:36,697 --> 01:27:37,597
Nobody's following us."

1164
01:27:37,897 --> 01:27:39,997
Go, go, go!

1165
01:27:44,397 --> 01:27:46,597
It's not rigged. Pull it.

1166
01:27:58,197 --> 01:28:01,897
Well, I'd say you could
call off your search.

1167
01:28:02,197 --> 01:28:04,397
- Can you stop it?
- I shouldn't even touch it.

1168
01:28:04,597 --> 01:28:08,797
Who knows what kind of booby traps
this thing's got. What about the code?

1169
01:28:09,097 --> 01:28:10,597
No word.

1170
01:28:10,797 --> 01:28:13,897
- When do we evacuate?
- Simon says he sees one kid
leave the building, boom!

1171
01:28:14,297 --> 01:28:17,397
Fine. There's a chance
that somebody's still watchin',
but we can't stand here...

1172
01:28:17,597 --> 01:28:19,997
with our thumb up our ass waitin'
for this freakin' thing to blow up!

1173
01:28:20,297 --> 01:28:21,598
Okay.

1174
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:29,498
- Shit! Shit!
- Get your head down!

1175
01:28:29,798 --> 01:28:31,898
Come on, Zeus, hold it steady!
Hold it steady!

1176
01:28:37,298 --> 01:28:38,498
- Go! Go!
- Outta the way!

1177
01:28:38,698 --> 01:28:40,198
Go around him!
Go around him!

1178
01:28:52,998 --> 01:28:54,898
- I found out who's the 21 st president.
- Who?

1179
01:28:55,098 --> 01:28:56,998
Some guy named Arthur.

1180
01:28:57,198 --> 01:28:59,098
- Chester A. Arthur?
- Chester A. Arthur. That's it. Yeah.

1181
01:28:59,398 --> 01:29:01,398
- Chester A. Arthur Elementary School?
- Yeah. That's it.

1182
01:29:01,698 --> 01:29:04,898
Gently down the stream

1183
01:29:05,098 --> 01:29:07,598
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

1184
01:29:07,998 --> 01:29:11,898
- Life is but a dream
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

1185
01:29:12,198 --> 01:29:14,698
- Life is but a dream
- Row, row, row your boat

1186
01:29:14,898 --> 01:29:17,698
- Gently down the stream
- Life is but a dream

1187
01:29:17,998 --> 01:29:21,998
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
- Life is but a dream
- Row, row, row your boat

1188
01:29:22,198 --> 01:29:24,698
- Gently down the stream
- Row, row, row your boat

1189
01:29:25,098 --> 01:29:27,698
- Merrily, merrily, merrily...
- Gently down the...
- Hi, kids!

1190
01:29:27,898 --> 01:29:31,298
I know you usually have assembly
on Fridays, but today is special.

1191
01:29:31,498 --> 01:29:34,199
Mr Lambert here
is from the fire department...

1192
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:38,099
and today he wants us to practice
a brand-new fire drill.

1193
01:29:38,499 --> 01:29:41,999
So, I want you to divide in half,
and I want half of you to go over here...

1194
01:29:42,299 --> 01:29:45,499
- teachers will help them...
and line up against the wall.
- Open the door.

1195
01:29:45,699 --> 01:29:50,399
The other half will go in this
direction. Please do it very quietly
and very quickly.

1196
01:29:50,799 --> 01:29:53,799
All right? Everybody up, please.
Teachers, please help them.

1197
01:29:54,099 --> 01:29:57,199
Fire drill, my ass.
That guy ain't from the fire department.

1198
01:29:57,599 --> 01:29:59,399
Maybe it's 'cause of the radio.

1199
01:29:59,699 --> 01:30:02,499
You mean, like, they're after us? Nah.

1200
01:30:02,799 --> 01:30:05,899
- Tony squealed on us.
- No, he didn't.

1201
01:30:06,099 --> 01:30:09,399
- Come on.
- Well, where you goin'?

1202
01:30:12,299 --> 01:30:14,599
- Let me drive! Let me drive!
- Go, go, go!

1203
01:30:14,799 --> 01:30:16,299
Goddam it!

1204
01:30:18,499 --> 01:30:21,099
Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Of course he put the bomb up
in that school.

1205
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:23,999
- Why would he do that?
- Make sure he got
your complete attention.

1206
01:30:28,599 --> 01:30:30,599
- Jesus! Jesus!
- Find the fuse panel.

1207
01:30:30,699 --> 01:30:32,199
- What?
- The fuse panel.

1208
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:34,199
- Where's the fuse panel to this car?
- It's right here! It's right here!

1209
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:36,499
- Pull out the anti-lock brakes fuse.
- Shit, I don't know which one it is.

1210
01:30:36,799 --> 01:30:39,199
Well, then yank 'em all out then.

1211
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:41,599
- There.
- Put your head down.
Put your head fuckin' down.

1212
01:30:41,799 --> 01:30:43,599
This is gonna be really bad.

1213
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:47,500
Listen to me.
Hang the fuck on, all right?

1214
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:17,900
- Oh! Oh! What the fuck happened?
- You got a triple-A card?

1215
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,500
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
- Excuse me.

1216
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,200
I got the janitors making a last sweep
of the building right now.

1217
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,900
Thank you, Miss Martinez.

1218
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,900
Come on.

1219
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,600
All right, five stud,
three nines, one...

1220
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,600
Stay down! Stay low!

1221
01:31:59,201 --> 01:32:01,001
Oh, man!

1222
01:32:04,201 --> 01:32:05,901
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- Interrogatin' him.

1223
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:07,801
Well, what's he gonna tell you,
"I'm dead"?

1224
01:32:08,101 --> 01:32:09,801
Well, I ain't gonna know
till I ask him, am I?

1225
01:32:10,001 --> 01:32:13,201
Go around and see if there's
any aspirins in that glove box.

1226
01:32:14,501 --> 01:32:16,601
No way. You do it.

1227
01:32:22,001 --> 01:32:24,101
Ten quarters.

1228
01:32:24,401 --> 01:32:27,101
The guy in the dump truck
had ten quarters. Exactly ten quarters.

1229
01:32:27,401 --> 01:32:30,101
Well, maybe they were makin'
long distance phone calls.

1230
01:32:30,301 --> 01:32:33,501
No. For the bridge.

1231
01:32:33,801 --> 01:32:35,401
- What?
- It's for the toll on the bridge.

1232
01:32:37,501 --> 01:32:39,501
There! There! Down on the wharf.

1233
01:32:39,801 --> 01:32:42,701
Dump trucks.
Right there! Right there!

1234
01:32:44,501 --> 01:32:46,601
Christ, they got it loaded
on a ship already.

1235
01:32:48,901 --> 01:32:51,001
Shit! How about the Coast Guard?

1236
01:32:51,201 --> 01:32:53,201
- It'd take 'em an hour to get here.
- Shit!

1237
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:56,201
Shit! We can jump.

1238
01:32:56,401 --> 01:32:57,701
- What?
- We can jump.

1239
01:32:57,901 --> 01:33:00,101
Outta your fuckin' mind!
It's 100 feet down to the deck!

1240
01:33:00,301 --> 01:33:03,501
- But not to the crane, it isn't.
- The cables would cut you in half.

1241
01:33:04,901 --> 01:33:06,601
- I can make it.
- Bullshit. Get down.

1242
01:33:06,802 --> 01:33:08,802
Get down. Look in the back
of that car for some gloves.

1243
01:33:12,802 --> 01:33:15,802
Six booby traps, four dead ends...

1244
01:33:16,102 --> 01:33:18,702
And a partridge in a pear tree

1245
01:33:23,102 --> 01:33:25,702
Okay, honey.

1246
01:33:25,902 --> 01:33:27,302
Let's dance.

1247
01:33:27,502 --> 01:33:31,002
We're gonna have sort of a race.
So when I say go, I want you all
to run like crazy.

1248
01:33:31,202 --> 01:33:33,502
All of you. You follow
the police officer and the fireman.

1249
01:33:33,702 --> 01:33:35,502
You guys are my front runners, okay?

1250
01:33:35,802 --> 01:33:37,902
Walter, think we're cuttin' this
a little thin?

1251
01:33:38,102 --> 01:33:41,502
No, Joe. We're gonna wait.
McClane still may get the code.

1252
01:33:44,102 --> 01:33:46,902
- Line me up with that crane!
- There. There. Right there. Right there.

1253
01:33:47,102 --> 01:33:50,402
- All right.
I see it now. I see it.
- Right there. You're okay.

1254
01:33:50,602 --> 01:33:52,902
- Shit. This is gonna take a miracle.
- Keep your fingers crossed.

1255
01:33:53,102 --> 01:33:55,102
Swing it. Swing it.

1256
01:33:55,402 --> 01:33:59,402
Come on. Come on. You almost got it.
Almost. Almost. Yeah! All right.

1257
01:33:59,702 --> 01:34:01,502
Where are you goin'?
What, are you in a hurry?

1258
01:34:01,702 --> 01:34:04,502
I'm goin' first this time,
all right?

1259
01:34:04,702 --> 01:34:07,402
We have the intercom rigged, sir.

1260
01:34:07,602 --> 01:34:11,602
Walter, the kids may be fine,
but you wait much longer and
I'm gonna pee in my pants.

1261
01:34:12,002 --> 01:34:13,802
We're gonna wait, Connie.

1262
01:34:15,002 --> 01:34:16,702
Six more minutes.

1263
01:34:31,103 --> 01:34:32,803
- Yo, McClane.
- What?

1264
01:34:33,003 --> 01:34:34,303
Down there.

1265
01:34:43,903 --> 01:34:46,803
Oh, shit. Go, go, man!
Go, go, go!

1266
01:35:12,903 --> 01:35:15,603
Oh, boy.

1267
01:35:15,903 --> 01:35:18,203
Am I glad you talked me
outta jumpin'.

1268
01:35:44,704 --> 01:35:46,604
Fuck.

1269
01:35:46,804 --> 01:35:48,604
Get his feet.

1270
01:35:58,404 --> 01:36:00,504
There's something you should see.

1271
01:36:00,804 --> 01:36:02,704
Later.

1272
01:36:03,904 --> 01:36:07,004
- It's important.
- Later.

1273
01:36:07,204 --> 01:36:08,104
Now.

1274
01:36:11,104 --> 01:36:13,604
This was in a container.

1275
01:36:28,504 --> 01:36:32,904
We go find Simon
and drag him to the ship-to-shore radio
and beat that fuckin' code out of him.

1276
01:36:33,304 --> 01:36:35,604
- Here. Take this.
- How's it work?

1277
01:36:35,804 --> 01:36:39,704
- You don't know how to shoot a gun?
- Look, all brothers don't know how
to shoot guns, you racist motherfucker.

1278
01:36:40,104 --> 01:36:44,105
Sue me. Just yank back on that
and pull the trigger. That's it.

1279
01:36:44,305 --> 01:36:47,605
- That's it?
- That's it. Just don't shoot yourself.

1280
01:36:48,005 --> 01:36:50,905
Hey, don't be no hero.
You find him, you come get me.

1281
01:37:08,905 --> 01:37:10,705
Hey, Katya!

1282
01:37:18,105 --> 01:37:20,405
Stupid. Stupid.

1283
01:38:02,806 --> 01:38:05,606
- You have the autopilot set?
- Yes, sir.

1284
01:38:05,906 --> 01:38:07,606
Good.

1285
01:38:12,106 --> 01:38:14,406
Don't fuckin' move.

1286
01:38:19,706 --> 01:38:21,806
Oh, the Samaritan.

1287
01:38:22,006 --> 01:38:25,406
- Gimme the goddam code.
- Code?

1288
01:38:26,706 --> 01:38:30,106
You mean for the school.
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

1289
01:38:30,406 --> 01:38:32,506
You call in that code right now...

1290
01:38:32,806 --> 01:38:35,706
or I blow your sick ass
into the next world.

1291
01:38:37,606 --> 01:38:39,106
If that's what you gotta do.

1292
01:38:52,006 --> 01:38:55,706
- You gotta take the safety catch off.
- Oh, goddam!

1293
01:38:56,006 --> 01:38:59,006
See. That works.
Now where's McClane?

1294
01:39:16,607 --> 01:39:18,307
What was that?

1295
01:39:22,407 --> 01:39:24,307
He said, "Don't shoot."

1296
01:39:24,607 --> 01:39:28,407
Okay, Charlie. We're gonna
have to go with the evacuation.

1297
01:39:28,707 --> 01:39:31,307
- We're gonna go.
- All right. You heard the man.
Let's go! Let's go!

1298
01:39:31,607 --> 01:39:33,007
- Move! Move! Move!
- We're gonna go!
- Let's go, men!

1299
01:39:33,307 --> 01:39:37,807
- On my mark.
Five, four, three, two, one, go!
- Let's go! Go!

1300
01:39:38,107 --> 01:39:40,007
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1301
01:39:41,607 --> 01:39:45,007
Let's do it!
Okay, gang. Let's go!

1302
01:39:45,407 --> 01:39:48,207
Go! Go! Go! Hip-hop! Hip-hop!
Come on. Everybody! Let's go!

1303
01:39:48,407 --> 01:39:50,007
- Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
- Keep moving.

1304
01:39:50,107 --> 01:39:54,207
- We're gonna win! We're gonna win!
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1305
01:39:54,507 --> 01:39:55,907
Keep moving!
To your left! To your left!

1306
01:40:08,107 --> 01:40:12,107
What are they doin'?
Yo, where you goin'?

1307
01:40:12,507 --> 01:40:14,407
- Hey, where you goin'?
- What's goin' on?

1308
01:40:14,507 --> 01:40:18,508
I see you all day, little man.
Policeman.

1309
01:40:20,208 --> 01:40:22,808
And you don't go away.

1310
01:40:23,008 --> 01:40:25,008
Yeah, I'm that fuckin'
Energizer bunny.

1311
01:40:27,708 --> 01:40:30,008
Where are you going now, huh?

1312
01:40:32,508 --> 01:40:35,608
Going to arrest me, "bunny"?

1313
01:40:35,808 --> 01:40:37,608
No.

1314
01:40:37,808 --> 01:40:40,608
I don't think
I'm gonna arrest you.

1315
01:40:40,808 --> 01:40:43,108
I'm gonna fuckin'...

1316
01:40:53,508 --> 01:40:55,608
I knew it was bullshit.
There's nobody watchin'.

1317
01:40:55,808 --> 01:40:57,608
Time to get Charlie out.

1318
01:40:57,808 --> 01:41:00,908
- Let's move, Charles. Time's up.
- Give me another 30 seconds.

1319
01:41:01,308 --> 01:41:03,308
Takes a minute-15
if you're a kid, Charlie.

1320
01:41:03,408 --> 01:41:05,808
And last I looked, you weren't too light
on your feet. Now move!

1321
01:41:07,108 --> 01:41:09,608
- Up here!
- Help us!
- Oh, my God!

1322
01:41:09,908 --> 01:41:11,708
- Come on!
- Look over here!

1323
01:41:11,908 --> 01:41:14,008
- Christ, get 'em outta there!
- Rooms are locked!

1324
01:41:14,208 --> 01:41:16,708
- The rooms are locked!
- Get outta the way!

1325
01:41:16,908 --> 01:41:21,408
Hey! Any one marked four!

1326
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:23,508
What's goin' on, Walter?

1327
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:26,008
We still have kids
in the building.

1328
01:41:31,109 --> 01:41:33,909
- I'm stayin'.
- No, Charlie. Get outta there.

1329
01:41:36,009 --> 01:41:38,709
You ever see that show
called The Addams Family?

1330
01:41:38,909 --> 01:41:41,509
They got a motherfucker on there
called Lurch.

1331
01:41:41,809 --> 01:41:43,909
You don't think I'm gonna let you
get to that gun, do you?

1332
01:41:49,009 --> 01:41:50,309
Fuck!

1333
01:42:09,809 --> 01:42:11,809
Help! Help! Help!

1334
01:42:12,109 --> 01:42:14,009
Four! Fuck it!
Get outta the way!

1335
01:42:26,309 --> 01:42:28,709
- Where are they, Walter?
- Still in.

1336
01:42:35,309 --> 01:42:37,609
No guts, no glory.

1337
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:43,510
If we get to the roof,
we can jump to the next building!

1338
01:42:43,910 --> 01:42:46,910
- Shit!
- Outta the way.

1339
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:50,310
Okay. Come on.

1340
01:42:50,510 --> 01:42:52,610
Get him up here. Get him up here!
Come on! Come on!

1341
01:42:52,810 --> 01:42:56,410
Mayday, mayday. Bridgeport Coast Guard.
Bridgeport Coast Guard, come in.

1342
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:11,810
Come on, kids.

1343
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:18,910
- Shit, it's too far!
- Over here. Down.

1344
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:26,810
No guts, no glory.

1345
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,810
There's a big black-and-white fuckin'
boat in the middle of the harbour.

1346
01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:32,510
- Please stay on the line.
- Yeah, sure. I'll stay on the line.

1347
01:43:51,011 --> 01:43:52,811
Pancake syrup?

1348
01:43:58,311 --> 01:44:00,011
Hello, John McClane.

1349
01:44:01,511 --> 01:44:03,511
There was never any bomb
in the school, was there?

1350
01:44:03,711 --> 01:44:06,011
Of course not.

1351
01:44:06,211 --> 01:44:08,711
I'm a soldier, not a monster...

1352
01:44:08,911 --> 01:44:11,811
even though I sometimes work
for monsters.

1353
01:44:12,111 --> 01:44:14,911
No. The real bomb is on this ship.

1354
01:44:19,311 --> 01:44:21,711
Coast Guard.

1355
01:44:22,011 --> 01:44:26,911
I was tellin' 'em where the boat was.
Game over, huh?

1356
01:44:27,311 --> 01:44:30,211
Not quite over.

1357
01:44:30,511 --> 01:44:33,511
Bridgeport Coast Guard.
Come in, please.

1358
01:44:33,811 --> 01:44:36,411
They put you on hold?

1359
01:44:36,711 --> 01:44:38,411
She told me to stay on the line.

1360
01:44:42,911 --> 01:44:46,211
- Oh, God, I love this country.
- You know, your brother was an asshole.

1361
01:44:49,111 --> 01:44:51,211
- You know, he really was an asshole.
- He was... He was an asshole.

1362
01:44:51,411 --> 01:44:55,211
You, you got his number, yeah?
Yeah, okay.

1363
01:44:57,411 --> 01:45:00,811
Forgive me.
Would you help Mr McClane below?

1364
01:45:02,512 --> 01:45:04,612
Careful now.

1365
01:45:06,012 --> 01:45:09,412
Now, do you have the communique?

1366
01:45:09,612 --> 01:45:11,312
Bridgeport radio,
come in, please. Bridgeport.

1367
01:45:11,612 --> 01:45:13,312
- Coast Guard.
- Are you there, dear?

1368
01:45:13,612 --> 01:45:17,312
- Yes, we're here.
- Do you have the ability
to record a message?

1369
01:45:17,712 --> 01:45:19,612
- Yes.
- Then please begin now.

1370
01:45:19,812 --> 01:45:21,112
Right.

1371
01:45:26,312 --> 01:45:28,912
This is a communique
from the CRF.

1372
01:45:29,112 --> 01:45:32,812
For too long, the West has conspired
to steal the wealth of the world...

1373
01:45:33,112 --> 01:45:36,712
consigning the balance of humanity
to economic starvation.

1374
01:45:36,912 --> 01:45:39,612
Today, we will level
the playing field.

1375
01:45:39,912 --> 01:45:43,012
In a few minutes, the contents
of the Federal Reserve Bank...

1376
01:45:43,212 --> 01:45:45,812
the gold your economies
are built on...

1377
01:45:46,112 --> 01:45:48,812
will be redistributed by explosive...

1378
01:45:49,112 --> 01:45:50,912
across the bottom
of the Long Island Sound.

1379
01:45:52,712 --> 01:45:56,112
If you are not in gridlock,
I invite you to come and watch.

1380
01:46:01,112 --> 01:46:04,112
- You're gonna blow it all up?
- That's the idea.

1381
01:46:04,412 --> 01:46:06,212
There are some gentlemen
in the Middle East...

1382
01:46:06,412 --> 01:46:09,012
who seem to think that they'll make
a great deal of money.

1383
01:46:09,312 --> 01:46:12,812
See the men safely off the ship, and
I'll see you in the port-side launch.

1384
01:46:14,113 --> 01:46:16,513
The hell's all this
got to do with killin' McClane?

1385
01:46:18,213 --> 01:46:20,313
Life has its little bonuses.

1386
01:46:20,513 --> 01:46:22,813
Didn't I hear you say
you didn't even like your brother?

1387
01:46:23,013 --> 01:46:25,113
There's a difference, you know,
between not liking one's brother...

1388
01:46:25,313 --> 01:46:28,713
and not caring when some dumb Irish
flatfoot drops him out of a window.

1389
01:46:29,113 --> 01:46:30,913
Hey, I didn't even know
that motherfucker!

1390
01:46:31,213 --> 01:46:33,313
Yes, and I never invited you
aboard this ship.

1391
01:46:33,613 --> 01:46:35,113
No riddle is gonna stop
this motherfucker?

1392
01:46:35,213 --> 01:46:37,913
No code, no riddle,
no fancy little countdown.

1393
01:46:38,313 --> 01:46:41,813
Hey, fuck-head.
Yeah, you. Fuck-head.

1394
01:46:43,513 --> 01:46:46,713
There's just one thing
I gotta know.

1395
01:46:47,013 --> 01:46:51,613
You got any aspirins? I've had
a bad fuckin' headache all day long.

1396
01:46:54,713 --> 01:46:56,313
Must be your lucky day.

1397
01:46:57,913 --> 01:46:59,413
Keep the bottle.

1398
01:47:11,813 --> 01:47:13,513
Where is the gold?

1399
01:47:16,213 --> 01:47:18,213
He's betrayed us.

1400
01:47:18,413 --> 01:47:21,013
The containers
are filled with that.

1401
01:47:53,814 --> 01:47:56,014
If I hadn't have saved your fuckin' ass,
I wouldn't be sittin' here with you...

1402
01:47:56,114 --> 01:47:58,314
about to blow up with $100 billion
in fuckin' gold!

1403
01:47:58,714 --> 01:48:01,114
Yeah, well, I got some bad news.
You're only gonna blow up with me.

1404
01:48:01,314 --> 01:48:03,014
- What?
- There's no gold on this boat.

1405
01:48:03,114 --> 01:48:05,814
- How do you know that?
- 'Cause I know the man.
I know the family.

1406
01:48:06,214 --> 01:48:10,714
The only thing better than blowin' up
$100 billion worth of gold is makin'
people think you did.

1407
01:48:11,114 --> 01:48:14,014
- Yeah? Well, where is it?
- I don't know. He must have switched it
back on the dock somewhere.

1408
01:48:14,314 --> 01:48:16,114
Oh, yeah. That's supposed
to make me feel better?

1409
01:48:16,314 --> 01:48:19,314
No. You're wrong about the other thing,
though. You're not gonna die.

1410
01:48:19,514 --> 01:48:22,514
Yeah? You know
some cop trick about handcuffs
that's gonna get us outta this?

1411
01:48:22,714 --> 01:48:25,214
Yeah. Use a key.

1412
01:48:25,614 --> 01:48:27,814
- You know how to pick this lock?
- Is this some black shit again?

1413
01:48:28,114 --> 01:48:30,514
Will you stop with that racial shit?
Are you a fuckin' locksmith or not?

1414
01:48:30,714 --> 01:48:33,214
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can do it
if I had somethin' to do it with.

1415
01:48:33,414 --> 01:48:36,414
- How about a splinter
of that cable I slid down?
- That might work.

1416
01:48:39,515 --> 01:48:41,715
- Hold on.
- Fuck are you doin'?

1417
01:48:45,215 --> 01:48:48,815
Oh, fuck! Shit!
How's that? That big enough?

1418
01:48:49,115 --> 01:48:51,115
Shit. Yeah.
Yeah, that might work.

1419
01:48:51,315 --> 01:48:54,315
All right. Then I'm gonna drop it
in your hands. Cup your hands.

1420
01:48:54,515 --> 01:48:56,315
Don't drop this motherfucker,
all right?

1421
01:48:56,515 --> 01:48:59,415
- Get, get it right. Come on. One...
- You ready? Ready?

1422
01:48:59,615 --> 01:49:01,615
Two... Spit it.

1423
01:49:01,815 --> 01:49:05,015
- Yeah! Get it?
- Come on. Come on. Move your hands.

1424
01:49:05,415 --> 01:49:07,715
All right. Okay.

1425
01:49:08,015 --> 01:49:10,215
Damn, McClane. You know,
I was just startin' to like you.

1426
01:49:10,515 --> 01:49:13,915
- Yeah? Well, don't. I'm an asshole.
- What are you talkin' about now?

1427
01:49:14,215 --> 01:49:16,915
- I lied to you, Zeus.
- About what?

1428
01:49:17,315 --> 01:49:20,115
You remember I said
Weiss found that bomb up in Harlem?

1429
01:49:20,315 --> 01:49:22,015
- Yeah.
- They found it down in Chinatown.

1430
01:49:22,215 --> 01:49:25,015
Oh, now that's low...
even for a white motherfucker like you.

1431
01:49:25,215 --> 01:49:27,615
I told you I was an asshole.

1432
01:49:27,815 --> 01:49:29,815
What the fuck was that?

1433
01:49:30,115 --> 01:49:32,415
I don't know.

1434
01:49:32,615 --> 01:49:34,615
Look, it was the only way
I could get you to come with me.

1435
01:49:34,915 --> 01:49:36,915
You got a wife, McClane?

1436
01:49:37,215 --> 01:49:40,115
- Yeah.
- I'm surprised anybody'd stay with you
long enough to be married.

1437
01:49:40,415 --> 01:49:43,415
Yeah. Well, she didn't stick around
too long. We're sorta separated.

1438
01:49:43,715 --> 01:49:45,215
What the fuck is "sorta separated"?

1439
01:49:45,315 --> 01:49:48,115
Well, she was in LA,
I was in New York.

1440
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:51,916
Had a fight on the phone. She hung up.
I didn't call her back.

1441
01:49:52,216 --> 01:49:55,416
- How long ago was that?
- About a year ago now.

1442
01:49:55,716 --> 01:49:57,416
About a yea...

1443
01:49:59,316 --> 01:50:01,816
What the fuck
are you laughin' about?

1444
01:50:02,116 --> 01:50:05,716
You threw away your marriage
because you were too fuckin' stupid
to pick up the phone?

1445
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:08,216
What, you think that's funny, huh?
You laugh at other people's misfortunes?

1446
01:50:08,416 --> 01:50:10,116
I bet you blame that shit
on your wife too, right?

1447
01:50:10,316 --> 01:50:12,316
Well, my wife
is a very stubborn woman, yes.

1448
01:50:15,316 --> 01:50:17,716
You better stop fuckin' laughin'
and undo these cuffs.

1449
01:50:18,016 --> 01:50:20,016
I'm almost there!

1450
01:50:20,216 --> 01:50:22,616
There! How's that for concentration?
Oh, shit!

1451
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:24,416
- What?
- Fuck! I dropped the thing!

1452
01:50:24,616 --> 01:50:27,116
- Dropped the fucking thing?
- Goddam it!

1453
01:50:27,416 --> 01:50:29,616
- Shit! Where is it? Where did it go?
- Find it. Find it, all right?

1454
01:50:29,816 --> 01:50:32,416
I don't fuckin' see it.

1455
01:50:33,716 --> 01:50:36,216
What the fuck is that?

1456
01:50:36,416 --> 01:50:39,116
I think I made it mad.

1457
01:50:39,416 --> 01:50:40,816
Just go, McClane.
Get the fuck out of here.

1458
01:50:41,116 --> 01:50:44,216
- Gotta fuckin' do somethin'!
- Goddam it, McClane! Listen to me!

1459
01:50:45,616 --> 01:50:47,916
Just go.

1460
01:50:48,116 --> 01:50:50,716
Have a hard enough time gettin' through
the day without havin' your death
on my conscience, man.

1461
01:50:51,016 --> 01:50:52,916
- Shut the fuck up and think, all right?
- Okay, okay.

1462
01:50:53,116 --> 01:50:55,916
- Tools. Tools. Check the engine room.
- There's no time!

1463
01:50:57,316 --> 01:50:59,116
- What the hell's it doin' now?
- It's mixin'.

1464
01:50:59,316 --> 01:51:00,717
Shit!

1465
01:51:02,517 --> 01:51:04,317
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Get ready. Lean forward.

1466
01:51:04,517 --> 01:51:06,917
- What?
- Lean forward, goddam it!

1467
01:51:07,117 --> 01:51:09,017
What? The fuck you doin'?

1468
01:51:09,217 --> 01:51:11,017
Now it's gonna go fast.
Lean forward.

1469
01:51:11,117 --> 01:51:13,617
- Oh, no, no!
- Lean forward! Get ready!
Move your hands!

1470
01:51:13,817 --> 01:51:16,217
Damn! Motherfuckin' shit!

1471
01:51:16,417 --> 01:51:19,317
- Come on. Let's go!
- Oh, goddam! Goddam!

1472
01:51:19,717 --> 01:51:22,617
- Come on! Come on!
- Oh, fuck! My leg! Ow!

1473
01:51:24,017 --> 01:51:28,117
Get upstairs! Come on!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Get upstairs!

1474
01:51:29,417 --> 01:51:31,617
Oh, shit! Ow! Damn it! My foot!

1475
01:51:31,917 --> 01:51:33,517
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Down there at the back of the boat.
Come on!

1476
01:51:33,817 --> 01:51:36,217
- No, damn it!
- Run, goddam it!

1477
01:51:36,417 --> 01:51:38,417
- I am, you...
- Come on!

1478
01:51:38,617 --> 01:51:40,517
- All right? Watch! Watch! Watch!
- Yeah.

1479
01:51:40,617 --> 01:51:42,817
Let's go! Down here!
The back of the...

1480
01:52:11,117 --> 01:52:12,418
How's he doin'?

1481
01:52:12,718 --> 01:52:15,118
I got shot in the leg.
How do ya think I'm doin'?

1482
01:52:15,318 --> 01:52:18,118
- He's gonna be just fine.
- How about you?

1483
01:52:18,418 --> 01:52:21,118
I'm all right.
Did ya get Ricky out of there?

1484
01:52:23,118 --> 01:52:24,918
Yeah, they found him.

1485
01:52:26,518 --> 01:52:29,618
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Got a bad headache.

1486
01:52:29,918 --> 01:52:32,518
- Think they're mad at me?
- I wouldn't worry about them.

1487
01:52:32,718 --> 01:52:36,118
They'll get to you eventually,
but right now they're busy with
this salvage operation, I guess.

1488
01:52:36,318 --> 01:52:39,418
No! Dre-Dredges! Dredges!

1489
01:52:39,818 --> 01:52:41,718
They're just wastin' their time.
There's no gold out there.

1490
01:52:42,018 --> 01:52:43,818
- What do you mean?
- He took it with him.

1491
01:52:43,918 --> 01:52:47,118
- He beat me.
- John, he beat all of us.

1492
01:52:47,418 --> 01:52:49,918
- He wasn't playin' against you.
- Fuck that, McClane.

1493
01:52:50,218 --> 01:52:53,218
You're still alive, aren't ya?

1494
01:52:53,518 --> 01:52:56,118
- Well, aren't ya?
- Yeah.

1495
01:52:56,318 --> 01:52:58,918
So he lost. Lambert.

1496
01:52:59,218 --> 01:53:01,618
Would you give him a quarter?

1497
01:53:01,918 --> 01:53:03,418
Asshole.

1498
01:53:05,818 --> 01:53:07,618
- Take it easy.
- I got him.
- That's it.

1499
01:53:07,818 --> 01:53:09,418
- Easy.
- Yeah, this is collect from John.

1500
01:53:09,718 --> 01:53:11,918
Thanks, guys. Appreciate this.

1501
01:53:17,418 --> 01:53:20,318
Yeah, uh, Carmine, just tell him
you'll accept the charges.

1502
01:53:20,618 --> 01:53:23,419
Son of a bitch had aspirin.

1503
01:53:23,719 --> 01:53:25,619
Yeah, it's John.
Yeah, I'm hangin' in there.

1504
01:53:25,719 --> 01:53:27,819
Is Holly there?
Yeah, I'll hold on.

1505
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:46,419
Zeus, hold up!

1506
01:53:46,619 --> 01:53:51,019
John? John? John?
Goddam it, you son of a...

1507
01:54:18,619 --> 01:54:20,519
Yesterday...

1508
01:54:20,819 --> 01:54:24,319
Yesterday we were an army
with no country.

1509
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:28,219
Tomorrow, we have to decide...

1510
01:54:29,519 --> 01:54:31,819
which country we want to buy.

1511
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:40,420
And remember,
this is all due...

1512
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:45,920
to the g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-gullibility
of the New York Police Department.

1513
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:51,820
To fallen comrades.

1514
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:19,220
Leutnant, take over.

1515
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:21,320
All right. Listen up!
First squad...

1516
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:24,020
you muster up in half an hour
in the school bus!

1517
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:25,720
You'll be the lacrosse team!

1518
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:29,420
The plane's in Nova Scotia.
We can leave in twenty minutes.

1519
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:39,220
No rush.

1520
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:43,820
And, Jurgen,
you'll be the Padre!

1521
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:45,520
Padre?

1522
01:56:08,921 --> 01:56:10,721
Lights! Douse those lights!

1523
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:37,621
Hey, dick-head!
Did I come at a bad time?

1524
01:56:43,121 --> 01:56:46,121
I think
she's pissed at you, McClane!

1525
01:56:56,021 --> 01:56:58,422
Go! Go!

1526
01:57:07,122 --> 01:57:08,922
He's under us right now. Come on
back around. Come on back around.

1527
01:57:09,122 --> 01:57:11,222
- That's right. Run, motherfuckers.
- Zeus, what've we got on your side?

1528
01:57:11,422 --> 01:57:13,222
Look like roaches
with the lights comin' on.

1529
01:57:15,922 --> 01:57:19,522
- Are we going to Nova Scotia?
- You go with the trucks!

1530
01:57:19,722 --> 01:57:21,922
I have something personal
to finish.

1531
01:57:24,922 --> 01:57:26,722
Let's go to work!

1532
01:57:28,422 --> 01:57:30,322
Come on! Move it!

1533
01:57:40,322 --> 01:57:43,522
That's right. Run, motherfuckers!
The exterminators are here!

1534
01:57:55,722 --> 01:57:59,522
What the fuck? Oh, shit!
What the fuck is this smoke back here?

1535
01:57:59,822 --> 01:58:02,522
We got a chopper behind us.
You got a gun on board?

1536
01:58:02,722 --> 01:58:04,922
What is this?

1537
01:58:07,522 --> 01:58:10,523
Can't see a goddam thing. Hold it
still. I can't see a goddam thing.

1538
01:58:14,623 --> 01:58:17,223
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

1539
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:19,523
What do you mean, "Oh, shit"?

1540
01:58:20,823 --> 01:58:22,523
All right. Hang on. Hang on.
We're goin' down.

1541
01:58:22,723 --> 01:58:24,523
Between those high tension wires?
See this wire?

1542
01:58:24,823 --> 01:58:27,123
Hey, McClane! What the fuck?

1543
01:58:29,223 --> 01:58:32,523
Hey, we got smoke! We got fuckin' smoke
and shit flyin' on me here!

1544
01:58:35,523 --> 01:58:37,323
- Truck! Truck!
- Hold on. Here we go!

1545
01:58:43,923 --> 01:58:47,923
Come on. We gotta get outta here! He's
gonna start shootin' at us any second!

1546
01:58:48,223 --> 01:58:51,023
- Get him out of here.
- Shit! The belt's stuck!
I can't get it off!

1547
01:58:51,423 --> 01:58:53,223
Look out! Here he comes!

1548
01:58:55,023 --> 01:58:56,923
Can't get out, McClane!

1549
01:58:57,223 --> 01:58:59,923
- Get him outta here.
- Where're you goin'?

1550
01:59:00,123 --> 01:59:02,223
I'm gonna try
and get his attention.

1551
01:59:20,323 --> 01:59:23,924
Oh, shit! It just keeps
gettin' better and better.

1552
01:59:29,624 --> 01:59:32,924
I had no idea Canada
could be this much fun.

1553
01:59:38,324 --> 01:59:40,724
Just give me somethin' to shoot at.
Come on, hotshot.

1554
01:59:41,924 --> 01:59:44,124
Show me that smilin' face.

1555
02:00:05,624 --> 02:00:07,424
Say hello to your brother.

1556
02:00:09,624 --> 02:00:11,224
Get outta here!

1557
02:00:27,424 --> 02:00:30,524
Yippee-ki-ay, motherfucker.

1558
02:00:33,825 --> 02:00:36,925
- Looks like you got his attention.
- Yeah. It looks like it.

1559
02:00:39,525 --> 02:00:42,725
- Think we should call a fire truck?
- Aw, fuck 'em. Let 'em cook.

1560
02:00:45,625 --> 02:00:48,625
- Oh, shit!
- What?

1561
02:00:48,925 --> 02:00:50,125
What?

1562
02:00:50,325 --> 02:00:53,325
- I left Holly hangin' on hold.
- Aw, call her back.

1563
02:00:54,925 --> 02:00:57,225
I don't know.
She's gonna be pissed.

1564
02:00:57,425 --> 02:00:59,925
She'll get over it.

1565
02:01:00,225 --> 02:01:03,125
I don't know, Zeus.

1566
02:01:03,425 --> 02:01:05,425
Like I said...

1567
02:01:05,725 --> 02:01:07,625
she's a very stubborn woman.

1568
02:01:07,925 --> 02:01:10,325
Well, she'd have to be
to stay married to you.
