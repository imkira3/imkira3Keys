1
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,044
You cannot defeat me.

2
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,964
Do not go to Silent Hill.

3
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,208
Honey, it's okay.

4
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,544
I'm here.

5
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,796
Dad?

6
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,383
i was burning.

7
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,218
Hey, come on, kiddo.

8
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,304
it was just a dream.

9
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,764
it's always like
this when we move.

10
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,393
This feels different.

11
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,769
Hey, look.

12
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,440
Once we've unpacked,
and given this
place a lick of paint,

13
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,901
it'll be our home, yeah?

14
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,653
The dreams will fade.

15
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,363
They're calling me.

16
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,201
Don't listen.

17
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,454
Don't listen.
Do you hear?

18
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,416
i want you to promise me
that whatever happens,
you'll never go there.

19
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,834
Okay.

20
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,219
Shit.

21
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,369
Rough night?

22
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,620
Yeah.

23
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,250
Dad, l don't want
to do this again.

24
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,711
L know, honey.

25
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,215
Yeah. Spoons.

26
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,555
"Heather." Why Heather?

27
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,434
it was my grandmother's name.
You can change it
if you don't like it.

28
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,852
No, no.

29
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,063
Heather's fine.

30
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:19,443
i was Sharon,
then Mary, then Cathy.
Now Heather.

31
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,321
You were Christopher
and now you're Harry.

32
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,490
Names don't matter.

33
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,119
i'm still me.

34
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,337
Happy birthday, you.

35
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,427
Dad, thank you!
But you're early.

36
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,429
Just a little.

37
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,724
Can't a dad indulge
his soon-to-be
1 8-year-old daughter?

38
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,193
What's wrong?

39
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,862
Nothing. l love it.

40
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,613
L love it. Yeah.
Yeah?

41
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,868
Lt is the one l saw you
looking at in the mall.

42
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,913
Yeah, yes.
Thank you. l love it.
l love it so much.

43
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,124
You're welcome, honey.

44
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,753
You're getting
a little bit gray there, Dad.

45
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,422
Your fault.

46
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,135
Your roots are showing.

47
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
Yeah, l know. l'll fix it.

48
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:34,518
i think this place is
gonna be good for us,
you know? What do you think?

49
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,853
Yeah.

50
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,354
Hey, come on.

51
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,775
Once l've unpacked,
given this place
a lick of paint,

52
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,443
you know, it will...
Don't, Dad.

53
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:46,781
What?

54
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,203
it's just what you
said in my dream.
Just, don't.

55
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,165
L got to go.

56
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,085
Don't want to be late
for the first day of school.

57
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,420
Hey, remember the rules.

58
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,713
New town, new school.

59
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,090
Yeah, yeah.

60
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,217
i've done this before.

61
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,803
i know you have, l'm just...

62
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,971
You know l worry.

63
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,516
Don't worry.

64
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,268
i'm careful.
i'll be fine.

65
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,939
i love you.

66
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,442
i love you too, honey.

67
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,327
Hey, Rose.
L wish you were still here.

68
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,414
it's been so hard
since you brought
Sharon back to me.

69
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,375
Christopher, my love.

70
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,379
Rose.

71
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,466
i tried to find you.

72
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,595
i searched for so long.

73
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,015
My love, l don't have
a lot of time.

74
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,100
i'm trapped here.

75
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,436
There's nothing
you can do for me,
protect her.

76
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,354
She's the one that matters now.

77
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,772
Why can't you come back?

78
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,528
i found a seal.
Part of it is missing.

79
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,989
Only one of us
could come through.

80
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,783
i made a choice.

81
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,785
Where's our daughter?

82
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,204
They'll come looking for her.

83
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,291
They'll come looking
because they need her.

84
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,752
Never let them take her.

85
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,462
No matter what happens,

86
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,714
no matter
what you have to do,
swear to me.

87
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,342
Swear to me you will
never let them take her.

88
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
i swear.

89
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,138
i brought her back to you.
She is yours to care for now.

90
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,806
Don't go.

91
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,644
Goodbye, my love.

92
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,398
Rose.

93
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,904
Daddy.

94
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,240
Sharon?

95
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,534
My God, Sharon.

96
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,747
You're here.
Daddy!

97
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,917
it's okay.

98
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,170
You're safe now.

99
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,465
What happened?
L don't remember anything.

100
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,092
it's okay. lt's okay.

101
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,136
You...

102
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,013
You were in an accident.

103
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,556
Where's Mommy?

104
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,478
Mommy saved you.

105
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,854
Where's Mommy?

106
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,441
She's gone, honey.

107
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,038
Sorry. l didn't mean
to scare you.

108
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,499
Sorry, what?
Are you okay?

109
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,503
Yes. Yes, l'm fine.

110
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,565
it's just that you
don't wanna be messing
with the vagrants, miss.

111
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,525
i was just seeing if
he needed some help.

112
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,510
Some people are
beyond our help.

113
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,848
Have we met?

114
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,519
No, no, l don't think so.

115
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,604
No?

116
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,397
L'm sure we have.

117
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,274
What's your name?

118
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,609
i have to catch my bus.

119
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,785
Welcome back,
everyone. l hope you had
a good Christmas vacation.

120
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,120
i would like to
welcome some new students

121
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,955
who will be joining us
this semester.

122
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,709
Heather Mason.
Could you say hello
to the class, Heather?

123
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,463
Hi. l'm Heather. l'm new.

124
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,508
i just moved to town, so...

125
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,761
Come on, Heather,
share a little
bit of yourself.

126
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,806
Everyone has a story.
Tell us yours.

127
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,681
What is this, third grade?

128
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,396
What do you wanna know?

129
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,615
Do you get all of your
clothes from Goodwill?

130
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,321
Okay, you know what?

131
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,573
Let me make this
easier for you.

132
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,952
This is the fifth school
l've been to since l was 1 1.

133
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,329
Me and my dad, we move around.

134
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,165
So l do this a lot.

135
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,043
So don't bother
trying to remember my name

136
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:36,130
because l'm sure as hell
not gonna remember yours.

137
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,425
Don't talk to me.
We won't be friends.

138
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:46,014
L won't lM you or facebook you
or tweet you, read your blog.

139
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,644
And whatever you're
thinking of saying or doing,
don't bother,

140
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,314
because l've seen it before,
and l'm just
guessing here, but...

141
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,901
l don't think there
are too many original
thinkers in this room.

142
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,237
And by the time any
of you have found out

143
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,043
anything about me
that's worth knowing...

144
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,159
l'll have moved on.

145
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,912
How's that?

146
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,289
Very impressive.

147
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,501
Now the next
addition to our class,
Vincent Cooper.

148
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,772
Are you kidding me?
L can't follow that.

149
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,276
Shit!

150
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:45,157
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!

151
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:52,456
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!

152
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,082
No.

153
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,876
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!

154
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,711
i'm not a witch!
Please!

155
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,005
Leave me alone.
Burn the witch!

156
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,925
Please! Come on!
Burn the witch!

157
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,531
Whoa.

158
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,908
Are you all right?

159
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,327
What?
Are you okay?

160
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,420
What are you
doing out of class?

161
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,006
You know what? l'm lost.

162
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,466
i can't find Math.
Any ideas?

163
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,678
No, no.

164
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,180
i... l'm lost too.

165
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,728
Hey look,
you wanna get a coffee?

166
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,521
No, we have class.

167
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,981
i mean, later.

168
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,443
No.
Why not?

169
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,029
We're both new.
We don't know anyone else.

170
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,199
That speech
l gave in class,
l gave it for a reason.

171
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,535
i really don't want
to know anyone here.

172
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,283
Hey, honey.
How was your day?

173
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,994
i think there's
someone following me.
What do l do?

174
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,914
Okay.

175
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,417
Don't come back here. Not yet.
L'll meet you somewhere.

176
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,754
Central Square Mall.

177
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:47,964
Then we can be sure.

178
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,092
Okay, l'll meet you
at the Happy Burger place.

179
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,180
i'll be there as soon as l can.

180
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:56,973
Do you think someone knows?

181
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,393
No.

182
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,978
No one knows.
L'll see you soon.

183
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,439
i love you, Dad.
i love you, too.

184
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,305
Happy birthday, Heather!

185
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,436
Make a wish!

186
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,485
Sharon.

187
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:36,865
Sharon!

188
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,035
Please, sir.

189
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,621
Sharon, wait!

190
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,151
Dad! Dad, l...

191
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,239
Sharon. Sharon, wait.

192
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,619
Sharon!

193
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,332
Keep away from me!
Keep away from me!

194
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
it's okay.

195
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:31,503
No, it's not okay.

196
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,879
Nothing is okay.

197
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,047
Who are you?

198
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,677
My name is Douglas Cartland.
L'm a private investigator.

199
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,345
What do you want from me?

200
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,807
i'm paid to find people.
Someone wanted
you found, Sharon.

201
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,016
That's not my name!

202
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,268
You're Sharon Da Silva.

203
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,063
Or at least you think you are.
Tracked you down
after you left Portland.

204
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,399
You and Harry got away
from the police,
but l found you.

205
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,818
What my dad did there...
That was self-defense.

206
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,444
i don't care who Harry killed.

207
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,406
i'm trying to help you.
Get back! Why?

208
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,494
Because l didn't know who
l was working for then,
but l do now.

209
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,219
They call themselves
the Order of Valtiel.

210
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,290
And they want you.

211
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,833
You're lying.

212
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,793
You don't understand.

213
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,088
They know where you are.

214
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,966
i told them where you are.

215
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,969
They're coming.
You've gotta get away.

216
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,470
Don't worry, l will.

217
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,431
Keep away from me!

218
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,391
Everything your dad
ever told you was a lie.

219
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,518
Fuck you!
He told me the truth.

220
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,437
You know why you don't
remember anything
from your childhood?

221
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,899
i was in a car crash.
My mother died.
l lost my memory.

222
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,484
No! There was never
any accident.

223
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,571
You were trapped in
a place called Silent Hill.

224
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,157
But your mother saved you.
She got you out.

225
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,201
But they want you back.
Ask your dad.

226
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,578
He knows that...

227
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,343
Tell me who l am.

228
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,516
Please, tell me.

229
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,332
it's gone. lt's gone.

230
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,629
i'll help you. Come on.

231
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:11,556
You two, move back now.

232
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,271
Hey, miss!
You can't be back here.
Back behind the tape, please.

233
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,857
Come on, folks.
L need you back.

234
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,610
Everybody,
get back behind the line.
Come on, move back.

235
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,947
Whoa, one second,
there's a wallet
in his pocket.

236
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:38,500
Douglas Cartland.
Some Pl from out of town.
What you got, Cable?

237
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,336
The boys found this
jacket down there.
There's blood on it.

238
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,338
Okay.
Hand it over to forensics.

239
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,340
Let's find out
whose blood it is.

240
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,677
Heather Mason.
Sharon Da Silva.
This girl? Maybe this is hers.

241
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,429
Let's find her and ask her.

242
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,098
See what we got
on this Cartland.

243
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,433
Pull the security tapes.
l wanna see what
happened here tonight.

244
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:56,935
Hey.

245
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,478
Vincent.

246
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,523
They found a guy dead
in there. Did you see?

247
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,941
Yeah.

248
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,275
Hey!

249
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,114
What's wrong?

250
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,658
i can't tell you.

251
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,118
it's okay, you can tell me.

252
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,202
No, l can't.

253
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,872
Because l have no idea
what's going on
in my head right now.

254
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,251
It's me.
Leave a message.

255
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:26,047
Dad, call me when
you get this, please.

256
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:32,971
You're cold.
Where's your coat?
Come here.

257
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,724
Thanks.

258
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,397
What's the matter?

259
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,651
Do you see them?

260
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,407
They who? The runner?
No.

261
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,663
Never mind.

262
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,250
Just another thing
to prove that
l'm going crazy.

263
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,755
So... Where's home?

264
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,258
A couple of blocks away.

265
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,011
No, l mean, before.
Where do you come from?

266
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:17,515
Nowhere, really.
l traveled a lot
with my dad.

267
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,568
Do you think there's
a difference between
dreams and reality?

268
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,071
What happened
to the small talk?

269
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,865
No "What's your
favorite band?"

270
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,389
"Do you facebook?"
Nothing like that.

271
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,118
Fuck Facebook. Do you?

272
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,121
L never think about it.

273
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,957
Everybody thinks about it.

274
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:46,836
Not me. My life is
complicated enough.

275
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,176
You should talk
to my grandfather.
lt's all he ever thinks about.

276
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
Drove him crazy.

277
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,304
it's driving me crazy.

278
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,681
No, l mean, he's insane.

279
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,516
Bat-shit nuts.

280
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,354
Back in my sweet
little home town,

281
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,981
old man Leonard
drools in a padded cell.

282
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,901
He'll tell you
there are no such
things as dreams,

283
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,737
just endless realities
all piled on
top of each other.

284
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:17,450
Some people see monsters,
other people just see people.

285
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,160
And they locked
him up for that?

286
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,788
My mother had him committed.

287
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,831
Jesus!
Yeah.

288
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,126
She's kind of intimidating,
my mother.

289
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:32,048
No difference between
fantasy and reality...

290
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,604
l don't think
l like my reality.

291
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,023
Do you think anyone does?

292
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,528
At least l'm real.
Well, l think l am.
And you?

293
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,408
Yep. Pretty real.
Or just pretty.

294
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:06,666
That was
a lousy pick-up line.
Does it ever work?

295
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,961
i never tried it before.
How'd it go down?

296
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,380
As a crime
against pick-up lines.

297
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,591
You're kind of funny, Heather.

298
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,429
You're pretty fucked up,
but l don't know,

299
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,389
l think you're
goofy fun inside.

300
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,100
Goofy fun?

301
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,146
That'd be nice for a change.

302
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,733
Anyway, this is my street.

303
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,695
Thanks for walking me back.

304
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,072
L'd like to do
it again sometime.

305
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:42,076
Vincent, you're nice,
but l don't think
you want to know me.

306
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,162
i do.
No, you don't.

307
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,252
i'm gonna call you later.

308
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,922
i didn't give you my number.
i'll see you around!

309
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,221
Dad?

310
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:18,780
Dad!

311
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,714
Dad! Dad!

312
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,566
Heather, it's Vincent.
l heard you yell.
ls everything all right?

313
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,114
i need your help.

314
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,615
Look.

315
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,417
is that blood?

316
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,878
Have you called
the police?
l can't.

317
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,547
Why not?
They can help.
l just can't!

318
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:18,840
Okay?
Okay.

319
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,596
Do you know where
this Silent Hill is?

320
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,682
No, it's...

321
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,685
lt's something that
l've dreamt about.
My dad, he...

322
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,520
He warned me never to go there.

323
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,231
But l know that symbol.

324
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,401
This is it.

325
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,612
He kept it all in here.

326
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:52,415
is this your mom?
My adoptive mom, Rose.

327
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,461
You were adopted?
Yeah, l never knew
my real parents.

328
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,720
Did you write all of these?

329
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,346
Yeah.

330
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,188
Do you know what that is?

331
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,564
No.

332
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,234
Looks like
there's another side
that fits in here.

333
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,994
- A gun?
- Why do you need a gun?

334
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,872
Miss Mason, it's the police.

335
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,559
i thought you said
you didn't call them.

336
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,292
i didn't.
Then why are they here?

337
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,085
What is going on, Heather?

338
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,545
i have to go.

339
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,255
if they catch me,
l'll never find my dad.

340
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,882
Catch you?
Why would they catch you?

341
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:46,552
What have you done?
Nothing! l haven't
done anything, l swear.

342
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,221
Help me.

343
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,345
What do you want me to do?

344
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,098
Can you drive?
What?

345
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,934
i can't drive. Can you?

346
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,441
Santini, come here.

347
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,197
You wanted probable cause?

348
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,324
This is it.

349
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,703
What the hell happened here?

350
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,168
That look like
a gang tag to you?

351
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:22,630
i don't think so.
But l've never
seen anything like it.

352
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,007
Call Crime Scene,
get them down here.

353
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,259
What about the girl?

354
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,593
She's a murder suspect.

355
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:55,955
"My dearest Sharon,

356
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,458
"lf you are reading this,
then something
has happened to me.

357
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,460
"You're on your own now.

358
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,212
"Don't try to find me.

359
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:06,591
"And whatever you do,
don't go to Silent Hill.

360
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:10,177
"l promised your mother
l'd keep you safe,
but l failed.

361
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,346
"l know you think
we're running from the police,

362
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,016
"because of the man l killed
in Portland two years ago."

363
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,520
You can't protect her forever!

364
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,315
Dad!

365
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,984
"But the truth is,
he wasn't just
a random thief."

366
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,694
Get your things, we're leaving.

367
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,863
"He was sent to take
you back to Silent Hill.

368
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,241
"He was a member of the Order.
These people want you,
they need you.

369
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,951
"l don't know why,

370
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,495
"but they will do
everything in their power
to draw you back.

371
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,289
"You must resist it.

372
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,124
"l tried to keep you safe.

373
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,460
"And l never meant to
lie to you, but l had to.

374
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:46,797
"You'll find
the truth in my notebooks.
As much as l could find out.

375
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,884
"l hope that when you
read what l've learned,

376
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,553
"you can finally
begin to understand
who you really are.

377
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,514
"Please forgive me
for not telling you the truth.

378
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,600
"l did it to protect you.

379
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,769
"l love you, Sharon."

380
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,731
Are you okay?

381
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,275
Do you wanna stop?

382
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,986
No.

383
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,663
What does it say?

384
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,331
So much.

385
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,709
i knew he was frightened,
but this is crazy.

386
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,215
it says, "Silent Hill was
originally a prison colony,

387
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,176
"built on ground
taken from
the native lndians.

388
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,096
"They called it
'The Place of
the Silent Spirits."'

389
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,307
Never build
on ancient lndian
burial grounds.

390
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:40,601
i thought everyone knew that.

391
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:47,817
it says here,
"Religious zealots
called the Order of Valtiel

392
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:51,112
"secretly ran the town
for the last 1 00 years.

393
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:56,117
"They were waiting
for a child to be born
to be a vessel for their god,

394
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,203
"who would then be resurrected
and make the world anew."

395
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,498
lt sounds like one of those
crazy doomsday cults.

396
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,458
Yeah. Sounds like it.

397
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,798
There is a newspaper article.

398
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,968
Fire in the coal
mines got out of control.

399
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,305
The whole place
is still burning,
deep underground.

400
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,099
Everyone had to leave.

401
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,479
My dad doesn't
believe that, though.

402
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,273
No?

403
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:30,651
He says the town
was cursed by the power
of a demon child.

404
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:35,573
Her name's Alessa.
This Order tried to
cleanse her with fire,

405
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,743
but they failed.
And Alessa's revenge

406
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,786
was to summon
a world of darkness,

407
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,913
filled with
terrifying creatures.

408
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:47,126
This one, it says,
is her "guardian
and executioner."

409
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,698
We should stop.

410
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:18,949
No, l want to keep going.

411
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,034
i'm tired.

412
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,078
i need rest, you need rest.

413
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,071
Do you think they'll find us?

414
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,156
Someone will, eventually.

415
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,910
You think we're far?
No.

416
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,997
No, l think we're really close.

417
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,958
And l don't think
you should go...

418
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,293
What?
L think your dad is right.

419
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,461
i don't think you
should go to Silent Hill.

420
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,712
i need to find him.

421
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,631
You read his notebooks.
He wants you to run.

422
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,592
Vincent...
No, listen to me.
The Order, they want you.

423
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,513
i think that's
why they took Harry.

424
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,306
To make you come back.

425
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,724
i don't have a choice.

426
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,226
Don't you understand that?

427
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,519
i understand.

428
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,772
i just...

429
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,779
l just don't want
anything to happen to you.

430
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,197
You didn't sleep?

431
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,119
No.

432
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,288
We can't go any further.

433
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,419
We already talked about this.
L have to.

434
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,671
Why can't you just trust me?

435
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,924
it's for my dad.
You don't understand.

436
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,467
i do.
No, you don't.

437
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,344
How could you?

438
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,512
Because l am
a child of the Order.

439
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,892
What?

440
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,186
i was born and raised
in Silent Hill.

441
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:56,065
i was chosen to
come into this world
to make sure you return.

442
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,733
No...

443
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,027
No, that's not possible.

444
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,447
The Order are
trapped in Silent Hill.
The notebook said so.

445
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,617
it is possible
for a few to escape
just for a while,

446
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:12,414
but it requires...
lt requires
sacrifice and suffering.

447
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,419
You have been chosen for this!

448
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,381
How could you do this to me?

449
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,091
My whole life,
all l've been taught...

450
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,928
All that any of us are taught
is that Alessa is
the great evil of the world.

451
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,305
She trapped us,
she brings the darkness,

452
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,808
and you...
You are part of that evil.

453
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,978
But l know that's not true.

454
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,355
After seeing you,
after spending
this time with you,

455
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,483
l know you're not evil, l...

456
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,820
lf you are part of Alessa,

457
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,530
you're the innocent part.

458
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:47,491
Every step of the way,
you lied.
l had to.

459
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,911
They were watching, projecting
their spirits into the world.
You saw them.

460
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,246
You took my dad.

461
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:55,082
Please believe me,
l had nothing
to do with that,

462
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,751
l'm sorry.
Why take him,
why not just take me?

463
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,878
Because you have to return
of your own free will.

464
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,089
Taking him,
they knew you'd follow.

465
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,550
Why do l matter so much?

466
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,302
Because the Order
can't be free until
Alessa is gone.

467
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,887
Her power keeps them trapped,

468
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,306
and she can't be destroyed
until she's whole again.

469
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,267
You will make that happen.

470
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:14,601
What about my dad?

471
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,145
is he still alive?

472
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,354
Yes, but not for long.

473
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:21,066
My mother, Claudia,
won't keep him alive after
she has what she wants.

474
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:22,276
Where is he?

475
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:23,527
in the sanctuary
beneath the town.

476
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,320
Wait, Heather, stop!
No!

477
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,531
You need this.

478
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,616
You have to find
the other half.

479
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,911
it's the only way
you'll be able
to save your dad.

480
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,039
My grandfather has it.

481
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,958
The one in the asylum?

482
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,836
Yes, Leonard Wolf.

483
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,548
He's dangerous.
Let me help you.

484
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,924
No! Get off of me!

485
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,177
Please! Please,
listen to me.
Don't!

486
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,470
What is happening?

487
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,846
The Darkness is coming.

488
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,018
it's coming.

489
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,062
What's going on?

490
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,324
Stop! Make it stop!

491
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,916
You did this.
No.

492
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,584
it's not me.

493
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,044
How could it be me?

494
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,178
Because you are part of Alessa.

495
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,392
We're so close,
you allowed the darkness
to break through.

496
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,398
Vincent, what is going on?

497
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,775
i don't know.

498
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,319
Vincent!

499
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,602
Burn the witch!

500
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,233
You should not be here.

501
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,741
They will use you.

502
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,869
We will all suffer now.

503
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,580
i know who you are.

504
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,166
You're her mother.

505
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,252
Alessa's mother.

506
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,964
How could you
let them burn her?

507
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:39,468
No, l loved her.

508
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,761
it's all right, sweetheart.

509
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:45,599
it's okay. lt's all right

510
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,060
I was deceived.

511
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,688
Come along, child.

512
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,024
i never wanted this for her.

513
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,026
Where are you taking me?

514
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,111
Mommy! Mommy!

515
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:04,451
But Alessa was special.

516
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,831
She was the only one
who could survive the fire,
that's why she was chosen.

517
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,917
No! Stop!

518
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,545
No! No!

519
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,799
But it only led
to our damnation.

520
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,843
You all got what you deserved.

521
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:26,223
Yes, and l became
the mother of the demon.

522
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,102
But you are her daughter.

523
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,648
What are you talking about?

524
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,693
Alessa didn't die in the fire,
but she suffered so much.

525
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,448
Her pain was only
matched by her rage.

526
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,661
And with that rage,
her powers grew

527
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,246
beyond all comprehension.

528
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:52,999
Alessa knew there
was a part of her

529
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,794
that could still
be free from pain.

530
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,842
So she took that last,
innocent part of her soul

531
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:07,347
and placed it into
a newborn, orphan child.

532
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,685
You.

533
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,940
You were secretly
taken from here,

534
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:20,569
to be raised by loving,
but unaware parents.

535
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,910
You're the only part of
Alessa that feels love.

536
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,207
You balance her hate,
but you should
never have come back.

537
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:38,670
Because now you have
given the Order what
they could never have...

538
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,215
A way to destroy
Alessa and you.

539
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,009
Where is my father?

540
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,054
There is nothing you can
do to save him without
damning yourself.

541
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,265
i don't care.
Just tell me what you know.

542
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,356
i know the darkness is coming.

543
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,154
it's safer to be inside.

544
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,114
Run.

545
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:09,576
Run!

546
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,064
No!

547
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,067
No!

548
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:11,716
What?

549
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:13,426
Help me.

550
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,147
No...

551
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:29,275
Run.

552
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:41,913
i'm here!
i'm gonna help you!

553
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:44,708
What happened?

554
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:45,834
Fast! lt's coming!

555
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,128
What's coming?

556
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,769
Come on! Run!

557
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,637
Where did you come from?

558
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:41,431
i took a wrong turn.

559
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,849
Got lost in the fog.

560
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:54,944
There! Come on!

561
00:51:58,908 --> 00:51:59,908
No!

562
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,369
This way.

563
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,728
Run!

564
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,368
My own son...

565
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,203
Mother, please...

566
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,496
betrayed us.

567
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,749
She is not evil.

568
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:56,089
Your mind is corrupted
by her darkness.

569
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,093
You were young to
be given this task.

570
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,012
i understand.

571
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,891
You created Alessa.

572
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:10,270
The darkness is your evil
reflected back at us.

573
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:11,604
She is innocent.

574
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:12,939
She is innocent?

575
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:17,235
You are insane,
just as your
grandfather is insane.

576
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,400
Burn him! Make him suffer!

577
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,487
Let the God judge him!

578
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,697
No!

579
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:27,954
You succeeded.

580
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:32,584
Even in your madness,
you guided her back to us.

581
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:35,962
What my sister, Christabella,
could not achieve, l shall.

582
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,715
Salvation is at hand.

583
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:45,054
And a broken mind
can be mended.

584
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,431
No.

585
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:47,974
Mother, please, don't.

586
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,393
Take him to the asylum.
Cure him.
No.

587
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,936
No. No!

588
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,170
Leonard.

589
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,388
Do you think someone knows?

590
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,139
No.

591
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,517
No one knows.
L'll see you soon.

592
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,602
i love you, Dad.
i love you, too.

593
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:13,745
Leonard Wolf.

594
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:15,621
Okay.

595
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:21,378
S-1 2.

596
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,723
Leonard.

597
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,518
Hello, child.

598
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,943
Please, come closer,
so l can touch you.

599
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,320
i don't think so.

600
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:37,073
Did Claudia send you?

601
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,491
Claudia?

602
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,452
Yeah.
No. She put you here.

603
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:45,248
My own daughter says
l'm corrupted by the darkness.

604
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:48,501
She says that l'm a monster.

605
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,878
She's far worse than l am.

606
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:55,424
She is also corrupted
by the same darkness.

607
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:59,178
i am looking
for my father.
ls he lost?

608
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:01,639
He's in Silent Hill.

609
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,810
There are many Silent Hills.
Are you sure it's this one?

610
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:07,270
Vincent said you'd
know how to help me.

611
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,814
Vincent, that little traitor...

612
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:13,150
My own flesh and blood
turned against me!

613
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:15,987
Listen.

614
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,615
You may be able to hear
the cries of his torment.

615
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,285
He's here?

616
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:25,997
Where else would you go
to mend your mind?

617
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,957
Like yours is?

618
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,375
i'm...

619
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:34,255
l'm just an ongoing project.

620
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:38,592
i have half of this.

621
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:41,220
Will it help me?
Please...

622
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:43,639
l'm blind, child.

623
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,060
i cannot see
what you have there.

624
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:53,065
Place it in my hand,
and l will try to help you.

625
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,359
Don't be afraid.

626
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,903
Come on.

627
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:08,914
You know what it is.

628
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,750
i was the Master of the Order.

629
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,545
How could l not know
the Seal of Metatron?

630
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:20,259
it was stolen from me
and used by her
to escape with the child.

631
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,263
Without it,
we cannot summon the god.

632
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,849
it is a key.
What does it unlock?

633
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,271
The true nature of things.

634
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,774
i need to find the other half.

635
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:42,698
- But you've already found it.
- The other half is in me!

636
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,784
What are you doing? No!

637
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:45,994
Stop!

638
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:05,221
Now l see the truth of you.

639
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:09,308
You're a demon!
You must be destroyed!

640
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:10,518
Not today.

641
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,191
Two halves coming together.

642
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:41,609
it's complete.

643
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:12,515
- Alessa?
- Alessa?

644
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:16,435
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?

645
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:22,024
You know l'm here, don't you?

646
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,318
You know l've got
the Seal of Metatron.

647
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,686
Somebody help me.

648
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:17,723
No.

649
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,163
Get back! Get back!

650
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:27,501
And you!

651
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,713
Get back!

652
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,047
Look out!
Get back!

653
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,850
Do it! Do it!

654
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,172
How can l find my dad?

655
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:58,133
Heather, help me.
Tell me where he is.

656
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,555
in the sanctuary,
beneath the amusement park.

657
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,058
i can help you.

658
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:12,773
Fine.

659
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,409
Hurry!
L am hurrying!

660
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,371
Shit!

661
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,010
Stuck! Heather, it's stuck!

662
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,136
Okay, we need a knife.

663
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,676
How can you live like this?

664
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,888
This darkness, those creatures?

665
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,057
it's all l've ever known.

666
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,019
My reality.

667
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:36,899
Darkness should
have faded by now.

668
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:39,151
Why hasn't it?

669
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,694
You're so close to Alessa,

670
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:44,323
two halves
coming together again,
it's changing the world.

671
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,575
What's gonna happen?

672
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:47,659
That's up to you.

673
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:53,332
Lakeside Amusement Park
is over there.

674
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:56,418
And the entrance
to the sanctuary.

675
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,720
Do you think you can save him?

676
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:11,475
i have to try.
My dad gave up his
life to protect me.

677
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,101
Then l think he'd
want you to leave.

678
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:14,770
You don't know that.

679
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:21,360
if he loved you,
he wouldn't want you
to be in any danger.

680
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:26,406
And if you loved someone,
you'd know that you
would never give up.

681
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,125
No, wait!

682
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:20,377
Get down.

683
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,170
Look.

684
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,047
Are they soldiers?

685
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,757
Not really.

686
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:29,553
We call them The Brethren.
The most devout
servants of the Order.

687
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:34,474
See the masks?
They won't breathe
the air of the darkness.

688
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,851
They think it corrupts them.

689
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:44,067
i hope you find him.

690
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:48,447
i hope you live
free and happy,
it's more than l ever did.

691
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:51,033
What are you talking about?

692
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,455
Vincent, no!

693
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:36,555
Alessa?

694
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:38,431
Daughter.

695
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:41,810
Sister.

696
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:44,437
Self.
No.

697
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:48,400
i gave you life so
you could live my dream.

698
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:51,486
You're the part of me
that could be
free of this pain,

699
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:54,030
could live and feel love.

700
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:55,240
Do you feel nothing?

701
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:56,908
Nothing but hate.

702
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,708
They say you are a demon.

703
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:06,084
They are right.

704
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:08,086
You created this nightmare.

705
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:12,507
Everyone has
a different nightmare
in Silent Hill.

706
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:15,177
i am theirs.
i have to save my father.

707
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:18,221
He's not my father or yours.

708
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,725
And sacrifices have to be made.

709
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,059
Go to hell!

710
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:24,769
Can't you see?

711
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,397
We're already here.

712
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:38,074
And you are not welcome!

713
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:46,124
Do you think l
won't destroy you?

714
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,335
How can you?

715
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,379
i am you.

716
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:59,596
Time to take back
what l gave you!

717
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,231
Stop!

718
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:15,570
We are one, Heather.

719
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:11,978
Dad!

720
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:13,813
Sharon!

721
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:17,734
Sharon.

722
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,240
You don't hurt her!

723
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:34,376
What do you want from me?

724
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,002
Look around you.

725
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:38,546
This was our sanctuary.

726
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:42,801
A last, safe place
from the darkness.

727
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:47,430
And now, even here
has fallen to her evil.

728
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:51,976
But we praise the god
that you are here, finally.

729
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,063
You have delivered us.

730
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:56,981
i have done nothing for you.

731
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,192
You have done everything.

732
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:02,654
Defeated Alessa.
Rejoined the seal.

733
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,490
You are the savior.

734
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:17,544
if l've done so much,

735
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,088
then let my father go.

736
01:19:21,549 --> 01:19:26,761
He cannot go.
His blood will
feed the newborn god.

737
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,850
Just as your body
will be its incubator.

738
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:33,685
Why?

739
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:36,896
Why me?

740
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:38,398
it is your destiny.

741
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:42,944
You have been chosen
many years ago
to be the vessel.

742
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:46,614
The god can only be
born through your flesh.

743
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,994
And then we will be
free from this prison

744
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:53,705
to cleanse
the world of its sins.

745
01:19:58,294 --> 01:19:59,711
And all we need

746
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:04,382
is your body.

747
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:05,925
No!

748
01:20:06,594 --> 01:20:07,594
You leave her alone!

749
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:15,226
You have the Seal of Metatron.
With it, l can summon the god.

750
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,228
Give it to me.

751
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:31,743
Take it,
l want to see the truth
of what you are.

752
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,005
Dad!
Sharon.

753
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,729
The ash.

754
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:07,231
it's stopped!

755
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,193
Because of you?

756
01:23:10,778 --> 01:23:11,903
No, it's not me.

757
01:23:12,946 --> 01:23:15,657
i think things are gonna
be different around
here from now on.

758
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:20,370
The Order's power is broken.
Alessa's nightmare is over.

759
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:21,871
She's gone.

760
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:22,955
Another one will come.

761
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,085
This is the place
of lost souls.

762
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,383
What's wrong?

763
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:36,260
i can't leave.

764
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:37,595
What? Why?

765
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:41,933
i'm going to stay here.

766
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:44,602
But, Dad, we're free.
We're safe.

767
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:46,521
For the first time.

768
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:47,728
i'm gonna find your mother.

769
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,817
You saved my life.
And l can never repay you.

770
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,736
Rose is still
trapped here somewhere.

771
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:55,822
i'm gonna find her.

772
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:57,031
Let me help you find her.

773
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:58,700
No.

774
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,452
i promised her,
once you were safe,
l'd come back.

775
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:05,456
This is my task.
You've done
what you had to do.

776
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:11,379
Now, l want you to
be free, finally.

777
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:15,133
Do you understand
why l have to do this?

778
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,308
You are everything
l could've ever wished for.

779
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:33,151
i love you, baby.

780
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:35,153
i love you too, Dad.

781
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:46,998
Vincent, look after my
little girl, do you hear?

782
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,417
i don't think
she needs me for that.

783
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,206
Come on.

784
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:30,833
Yeah.

785
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:03,241
Come on in.

786
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:05,409
Watch your step.

787
01:26:07,538 --> 01:26:08,913
Thanks.
No problem.

788
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:13,000
You're lucky l came by.
l haven't been this
way in a long time.

789
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:15,503
Travis Grady.

790
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:16,671
Vincent.

791
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:20,299
Sharon.
Nice to meet you.

792
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:23,094
So where're you
two lovebirds headed?

793
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:26,138
Just take us as
far away from here
as you can.

794
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:29,433
Amen to that!
Got it.
