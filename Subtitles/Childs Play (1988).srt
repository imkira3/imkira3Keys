1
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:41,213
I got the strangler! Wabash and Van buren!

2
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, shit.

3
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:18,838
Oh, shit!

4
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:20,463
Jack, get the Van.

5
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:22,713
Eddie, help me!

6
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,172
Eddie, Eddie, don't leave me! God, no!

7
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:45,672
Give it up, ray! It's over!

8
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:09,630
Oh, god, I'm dying.

9
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:15,922
You hear this, you son of a bitch!

10
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:19,672
I'm gonna get you for it!

11
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:24,130
I'm gonna get you

12
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:26,130
and I'm gonna get Eddie

13
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,088
no matter what!

14
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,922
I gotta find somebody.

15
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:48,213
I gotta find somebody.

16
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:55,713
I gotta find somebody.

17
00:03:57,422 --> 00:03:59,005
I gotta find somebody.

18
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:42,630
Give me the power, I beg of you!

19
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:28,672
[Have no friends.
No one will play with me.

20
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:32,172
Uh-oh. There's a friend in need.

21
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,047
Hey, cheer up.

22
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:37,713
- Who are you?
- I'm a good guy.

23
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,213
I've just come from
the good guy clubhouse,

24
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:42,213
and I'll be your friend to the end.

25
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,505
You will?
You mean you'll be my friend now?

26
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:48,547
Sure, I will.

27
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,588
Hidey-ho.

28
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,005
I saw this one.

29
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:58,422
I hidey, hidey, ho j“

30
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:01,255
j“ best friends till the end I

31
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:17,713
All right, good guys,
that's our "good guy show" for today,

32
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,088
but don't go away,

33
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:22,255
because we've got a very important
good guy message

34
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:24,088
just for you.

35
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:29,963
Hi, good guys.
Boy, have I got news for you.

36
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:33,755
Now you can have your very own
good guy doll.

37
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:36,213
That's right.
You can have all the adventures

38
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,380
we have on TV in your very own home.

39
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:42,713
Good guys say three different sentences.

40
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,547
We even turn our heads and
blink our eyes when you talk to us.

41
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:47,963
Right, Oscar?

42
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:51,588
Hi, I'm Oscar,
and I'm your friend to the end.

43
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:53,838
Hidey-ho!

44
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:56,172
Wow!

45
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:59,463
Every good guy
has a name all his own

46
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,963
so he can be your very own best friend.

47
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,505
So remember to tell mom and dad
you want a good guy.

48
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:10,297
Perfect for birthdays
or just any old time.

49
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:13,338
And remember, you can buy

50
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:16,672
all of our good guy accessories, too.

51
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:18,505
- Right, Oscar?
- Right.

52
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:23,255
Brought to you exclusively
by play pals

53
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:25,338
makers of good guys and other fine toys.

54
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,255
Found in toy stores
throughout the greater Chicago area.

55
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:33,483
I hidey, hidey, ho j“

56
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,172
mommy, wake up!

57
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:39,380
Mommy!

58
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:44,880
Mommy, wake up!

59
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:51,088
Mommy, wake up!

60
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:54,380
- Wake up, mommy, wake up!
- Andy!

61
00:08:57,713 --> 00:09:00,713
- What time is it, Andy?
- Wake up.

62
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,047
6:30. It's only 6:30 in the morning.

63
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,338
0h!

64
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,172
But it's a beautiful day outside. See?

65
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:16,172
It certainly is.
How long you been up, birthday boy?

66
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:18,672
Since forever.

67
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:21,797
I made you breakfast in bed.

68
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:24,088
You did? Oh, god.

69
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:26,463
Well, thanks.

70
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:29,880
Well, this looks just excellent.

71
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:31,505
Um...

72
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:33,713
I'll tell you what.

73
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:36,755
Why don't I eat this
just a little later, okay?

74
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:38,088
Mm-hmm.

75
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,047
But first, I gotta give you
your super-duper birthday tummy-gummy.

76
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:45,755
Come here. Come here. Come here.

77
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:48,005
Come here.

78
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,338
That's one. How many years
old are you today? Two?

79
00:09:51,797 --> 00:09:53,422
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

80
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:57,880
Thanks. Can we open
my presents now, mommy?

81
00:09:58,047 --> 00:10:01,005
- Yes, we can.
- Terrific!

82
00:10:02,547 --> 00:10:05,172
Good morning, Chicago.
Leading off at this hour

83
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,922
Charles Lee ray,
the notorious Lake Shore strangler,

84
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:12,297
was shot and killed shortly before three
am this morning on wabash Avenue.

85
00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:15,505
Can I open this first, mommy?
Can I? Can I?

86
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:18,078
Andy, don't you want to start
with the smaller one first?

87
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:22,505
Okay, go ahead.

88
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:32,005
Well, what do you think?
You need these clothes so badly.

89
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:33,731
Hey, I think they're gonna be okay.

90
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:36,005
We'll just have to take them up
just a couple inches.

91
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:41,755
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

92
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:45,213
Oh, I know. You want some toys, don't you?

93
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,047
Not boring old clothes.

94
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:50,297
Try the other one.

95
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,630
Well? What do you think?

96
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:59,005
I want a good guy to go with it.

97
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:01,880
I know you do, Andy,
but I didn't know about it

98
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:03,797
in time this month to save up for it.

99
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,838
- Karen.

100
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:17,725
You know that doll you wanted
for Andy? The one that costs 100 bucks.

101
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,648
- Yeah, the good guy doll.
- There's a peddler in the alley

102
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:21,880
behind the store and I think he's got one.

103
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:23,523
What? What would a peddler be doing
with a doll?

104
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:26,064
Who cares? Would you grab your purse
and come on? We can get a deal on it.

105
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:28,398
- But I can't just leave my counter.
- Do you want the damn doll or don't you?

106
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,088
- Of course I do.
- Well then come on.

107
00:11:30,463 --> 00:11:31,755
- Come on!
- All right!

108
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:36,422
There he is.

109
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:41,838
Okay, show her.

110
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,088
Well, is it a good guy or not?

111
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:49,755
It is. It is!

112
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:52,567
- Yeah, well, I told you.
- Oh, uh, how much do you want for it?

113
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,588
- 50 bucks.
- 10 and not a penny more.

114
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,088
- 30.
- What, are you kidding?

115
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:57,880
That thing is not worth 30 dollars.

116
00:11:58,047 --> 00:12:00,023
Hey, look. Take it or leave it.
Somebody else will buy it.

117
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:02,127
- I'll take it.
- Karen, it's too much money.

118
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:04,148
No, it isn't. You have no idea
how much Andy wants this doll.

119
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:06,012
But we don't even know
if the damn thing works.

120
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:07,338
Here you go, lady.

121
00:12:07,505 --> 00:12:08,981
May it bring you and your kid
a lot of joy.

122
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:10,047
Thank you.

123
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:11,838
Hey! Hold on, you!

124
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:14,672
How do we know the damn thing
isn't stolen, huh?

125
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:17,797
- Steal this!
- Ah, steal this yourself.

126
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:20,380
- Maggie.
- I think I dated him.

127
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:22,588
Come on. We gotta get back to work.

128
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,560
Maggie,
I don't know how you do it.

129
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,547
Andy's going to love it!

130
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:32,630
Mrs. Barclay, so nice of you to drop by.
Have a nice break?

131
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:34,231
I'm sorry, Mr. Criswell.
I was only gone for a minute.

132
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,422
Have a heart, criswell.

133
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,948
We were downstairs buying her little boy
a birthday present.

134
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:41,130
We have specified break times
for activities like that, miss Peterson.

135
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:43,838
Mrs. Howe has taken sick
and we're shorthanded tonight.

136
00:12:44,005 --> 00:12:45,297
You'll have to fill in for her.

137
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:48,268
I can't. I have to pick up my son
at the day care center in an hour.

138
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:51,023
- I'm sorry, this is an emergency.
- Wait a second, I'll take over for her.

139
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:54,880
Miss Peterson, you work in shoes,
not in jewelry.

140
00:12:55,047 --> 00:12:56,547
You'll just simply have to do it.

141
00:12:56,713 --> 00:12:59,630
Now, you can take off at five
but you'll have to be back at seven.

142
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:01,422
It's my son's birthday.

143
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:04,047
Mrs. Barclay,
are you happy with your job here?

144
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:05,505
Yes, of course I am.

145
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:07,463
- Then I suggest that...
- Hey.

146
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,130
Chill out, would you, Walter? Huh?

147
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:13,481
- I'll take care of Andy for you.
- Oh, Maggie, you can't do it again.

148
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:16,380
Don't be silly. It'll be
the hottest date I've had in months.

149
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,380
I can't imagine why.

150
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:31,255
- Hey, where are you going?
- Good guys are on TV.

151
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:33,380
Well, I may have something better for you.

152
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:35,297
What?

153
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:38,880
This isn't groceries.

154
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,547
A good guy! I knew it!

155
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:57,547
I knew you'd get me one!

156
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,130
Show me how he works, okay?

157
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:04,297
Hi, I'm Andy. What's your name?

158
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,297
Hi, I'm Chucky,
and I'm your friend to the end.

159
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,005
Hidey-ho.

160
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:14,088
Wow! He's something, isn't he?

161
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,755
Oh, mom, thanks.

162
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,297
You're welcome, honey.

163
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,380
See, that's how you build things.

164
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,231
Wdol with a late-breaking report.

165
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:47,213

accomplice of Charles Lee ray,

167
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:52,255
More details to follow
on the news at nine next.

168
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:59,797
Hey, Chucky, you're not watching me.

169
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,213
Hey, want to play?

170
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,255
Hey, it's time for bed, Andy.

171
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:12,963
Come on, Chucky. We have to
get ready to go to bed.

172
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,547
Aunt Maggie, Chucky wants to watch

173
00:15:25,713 --> 00:15:28,797
the nine o'clock news.

174
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:30,338
Sure he does.

175
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:35,380
Okay, kid, off we go.

176
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:37,713
Come on. There we go.

177
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:42,755
- Chucky.
- Oh, yes, Chucky.

178
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,505
You too. Off we go.

179
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,672
Now it's brush your teeth
and under the covers with you.

180
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,505
Okay? Agreed?

181
00:15:57,672 --> 00:15:58,797
Good.

182
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:02,297
Okay. You yell when you're ready
for me to tuck you in.

183
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,505
Hey, Chucky, want to see my room?

184
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:26,213
Andy, are you brushing your teeth?

185
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,797
Yes, aunt Maggie!

186
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:30,463
Good.

187
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:40,255
And now, action news at nine.

188
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,630
In Washington today,
the mayor replied

189
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:48,213
that he would study
the congressional findings carefully

190
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,672
and have the commission on gang-related
violence issue recommendations to him.

191
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:54,380
Back to you, Steve.

192
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,380
Thank you, Terry.

193
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,880
In other news,
police have now clarified the information

194
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:01,213
regarding the escape of Eddie caputo.

195
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,523
Authorities say that
caputo managed to elude his captors

196
00:17:03,547 --> 00:17:06,755
while being transferred onto
a prison bus on his way to court.

197
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:18,213
Okay, mister, what do you
have to say about this, huh?

198
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,297
- About what?
- Come on. Come on.

199
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:27,172
You know, you have to learn
that when I say something, I mean it.

200
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,672
- But what did I do?
- You know what I'm talking about.

201
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:33,255
Turning the TV on
and putting Chucky in front of it

202
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:35,838
when I told you it was time to go to bed.

203
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,422
- I didn't do that.
- Oh, no? What did Chucky do?

204
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:41,338
Walk into the living room
and turn it on all by himself?

205
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,505
Did you do that, Chucky?

206
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:46,297
Andy, stop it!
Now, come on, under the covers! Hurry.

207
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,797
- But aunt...
- Under the covers and not another word.

208
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:55,338
But I didn't put Chucky
in front of the TV.

209
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,672
Shh. Enough. Okay?

210
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:00,088
Give me a kiss.

211
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:03,380
Good night, baby, and happy birthday.

212
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:05,505
Good night, aunt Maggie.

213
00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:26,672
I told you she'd be mad at you
if you watched the news.

214
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:43,922
Andy?

215
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:22,130
Andy, is that you?

216
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,213
[Yelpsj

217
00:21:58,255 --> 00:21:59,297
How did that happen?

218
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:02,130
Uh, hello?

219
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,838
Hi. How's it going? How's Andy?

220
00:22:05,713 --> 00:22:07,630
- Karen?
- Yeah. Who else would it be?

221
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:08,797
Is something wrong?

222
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:11,755
Uh. No.

223
00:22:11,922 --> 00:22:13,338
No.

224
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:15,505
Everything's fine.

225
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:19,088
Are you sure? You don't sound
like everything's fine.

226
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,547
No. I just had a bit of
the alone-at-night willies, you know?

227
00:22:23,922 --> 00:22:26,005
Now, would you stop worrying and...

228
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:29,422
Give criswell
a kick in the pants for me, huh?

229
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:31,713
You got it.

230
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:35,255
Hey, listen, Maggie. Thank you for
everything. You're a real pal.

231
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:37,505
Oh, yeah?

232
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:39,672
Yeah, yeah.
Give Andy a kiss for me, will ya?

233
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:41,922
See you soon. Bye.

234
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:22,588
What is wrong with me?

235
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:24,963
I'm scaring myself half to death.

236
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:57,297
Get away from this barricade.

237
00:23:57,463 --> 00:24:00,380
Come on. Move it back.
There's nothing to see.

238
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:04,505
Now let's move this police line back.
Go on home, folks, please.

239
00:24:15,713 --> 00:24:17,338
She was on the sixth floor.

240
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:31,023
Whoa, miss! Miss! Wait, whoa, whoa!
What do you think you're doing?

241
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:32,338
I live here.

242
00:24:38,838 --> 00:24:40,005
Andy?

243
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:43,963
Oh no. Andy?

244
00:24:45,338 --> 00:24:46,630
Andy?

245
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:48,713
Andy!

246
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,922
Mommy!

247
00:24:50,547 --> 00:24:52,380
Oh, thank god.

248
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,505
Are you all right?

249
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,297
I'm so glad. I got so scared when I...

250
00:24:58,047 --> 00:24:59,797
What's wrong? Where's Maggie?

251
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:04,588
- She had an accident.
- Accident? What kind of an accident?

252
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:07,713
Mrs. Barclay,
I'm detective Mike Norris, homicide.

253
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,588
Could I talk to you out in the hall?

254
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:12,255
- Why? What's happened to Maggie?
- Please.

255
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,338
I'll be right back.

256
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,880
Look, Mrs. Barclay...

257
00:25:34,172 --> 00:25:35,297
What?

258
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:38,463
- Miss Peterson's dead, Mrs. Barclay.
- What?

259
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:44,213
- How?
- She fell from your kitchen window.

260
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:47,463
- No!
- Whoa.

261
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:50,297
You all right?

262
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,088
- Yes.
- All right.

263
00:25:53,588 --> 00:25:54,880
Come on.

264
00:25:59,505 --> 00:26:00,630
Oh, Maggie.

265
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:08,172
Oh, Maggie. Oh.

266
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:14,797
Do you got any idea what these are?

267
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:24,255
They look like footprints,
don't they? Very small footprints.

268
00:26:26,172 --> 00:26:27,172
What are you implying?

269
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:29,672
I don't know.

270
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,023
What would Andy be doing
up on the counter, right?

271
00:26:32,047 --> 00:26:34,005
- What?
- Besides, I already checked his closet.

272
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:35,838
None of his shoes matched these prints.

273
00:26:36,755 --> 00:26:38,172
Mommy?

274
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:39,588
Mommy?

275
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:42,630
Chucky wanted to know what was going on.

276
00:26:42,797 --> 00:26:45,273
Andy, I want you to go to bed.
The detective and I are very busy.

277
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:48,255
- But mom...
- Right now, please.

278
00:26:50,047 --> 00:26:51,338
Andy?

279
00:26:52,005 --> 00:26:53,422
What do you got on your feet?

280
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:56,880
Good guy pj sneakers.

281
00:26:57,338 --> 00:26:59,963
Wow. Come here.

282
00:27:02,297 --> 00:27:04,630
- Can I see the bottoms of them?
- Sure.

283
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:09,172
Ooh, look at this, huh?
There's a gun. Is that a cowboy hat?

284
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:12,547
Andy, get into bed.
I'll be in in a minute to tuck you in.

285
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:14,422
- But mom...
- Right now!

286
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:21,797
Why are you treating Andy like this?

287
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:24,923
If he says he doesn't know how those
footprints got there, then he doesn't.

288
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:28,633
Look, Mrs. Barclay, somebody made those
footprints. If not Andy, then who?

289
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:30,380
I don't know and I don't care.

290
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:33,689
All I know is that I've just lost my best
friend tonight to a horrible accident

291
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:35,314
and I would like some time alone
with my son,

292
00:27:35,338 --> 00:27:37,672
who I'm sure is just as upset
about this as I am.

293
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:39,297
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

294
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:42,713
Um, I'll clear everybody out of here
right away. Okay?

295
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,422
Hey, guys, you done? Huh? Let's go.

296
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,088
Chop, chop. Let's go, everybody.
Out of here!

297
00:27:58,797 --> 00:28:03,755
What do you think was so important
about my sneakers, Chucky?

298
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:06,963
You don't know either, do you?

299
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:30,213
Let me know if you find out
anything about those footprints.

300
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,713
Mommy! Mommy!

301
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,255
Mommy, I know who was
on the kitchen counter.

302
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:36,380
- Andy! I thought I told...
- Who, Andy? Who?

303
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:38,047
Chucky!

304
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,630
Yourdoh?

305
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,505
Andy, that's enough stories for tonight.
Now, come on, back to bed. I mean it!

306
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:46,797
But mom...

307
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:52,338
Good night, detective.

308
00:28:56,088 --> 00:28:57,922
- What?
- Are you going to call me?

309
00:28:58,088 --> 00:29:01,963
- You don't give up, do you?
- I just... I hate loose ends.

310
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,930
And I hate people
who don't know when to stop.

311
00:29:04,338 --> 00:29:05,630
Oof.

312
00:29:05,797 --> 00:29:08,880
- Ouch. A spirited lady.
- No kidding.

313
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:12,255
I want that autopsy report
on my desk first thing tomorrow.

314
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:13,939
- Yeah.
- And anything you can find out

315
00:29:13,963 --> 00:29:15,422
about Mrs. Barclay and her son.

316
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,213
You got it! Anything else
I can do for you, sir?

317
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,672
Oh, yeah. Here. Get this to the lab.

318
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:23,880
I found it in the corner of the kitchen.

319
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:26,255
- What is this?
- Possible murder weapon.

320
00:29:28,672 --> 00:29:30,255
Come on. You're kidding me.

321
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:34,130
Hey, you are kidding me, aren't you?

322
00:30:03,255 --> 00:30:04,588
Andy, who are you talking to?

323
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:06,838
Chucky.

324
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:19,213
Chucky, huh?

325
00:30:19,922 --> 00:30:21,838
Yeah, sure, Chucky.

326
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:24,338
He's sitting right over there.

327
00:30:27,588 --> 00:30:29,505
Chucky's been talking to you too,
hasn't he?

328
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:34,088
- What's he been saying?
- All kinds of things.

329
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:37,713
His real name is Charles Lee ray

330
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,588
and he's been sent down
from heaven by daddy

331
00:30:41,755 --> 00:30:43,422
to play with me.

332
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:50,922
He has, has he? Anything else?

333
00:30:51,088 --> 00:30:54,672
Yes. He said aunt Maggie was a real bitch

334
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:57,172
and got what she deserved.

335
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:01,130
Andy, how can you say
something so horrible?

336
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,547
I didn't say it. Chucky did.

337
00:31:03,713 --> 00:31:07,880
Andy, stop it. You know perfectly well
that you're making this up!

338
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:11,838
But I'm not. Chucky's alive.
Really, he is.

339
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:14,880
Andy. Chucky. Chucky's a doll.

340
00:31:15,213 --> 00:31:17,380
He's made of plastic and stuffing.

341
00:31:17,547 --> 00:31:20,630
Look at him. Look at him.
Does he look like anything else to you?

342
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,713
- Huh?
- Don't, you'll hurt him.

343
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,213
Andy, look!

344
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:27,922
Now, you don't really think
that Chucky is alive, do you?

345
00:31:28,547 --> 00:31:29,797
But he is.

346
00:31:29,963 --> 00:31:32,713
Andy, stop it! Please!

347
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:38,172
It's 'cause of aunt Maggie
you're yelling at me, isn't it?

348
00:31:41,297 --> 00:31:44,755
Yes. Yes, I guess it is.

349
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:46,880
I'm sorry.

350
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:49,838
I'll stop making up stories.

351
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,588
Thanks, champ.

352
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,980
Do you want to sleep in with me tonight?

353
00:32:00,547 --> 00:32:02,088
No, it's all right.

354
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,880
I've got Chucky.

355
00:32:08,713 --> 00:32:09,838
Come on, into bed.

356
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:17,130
Good night, sweetheart.

357
00:32:19,588 --> 00:32:20,630
I love you.

358
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:28,588
Bye-bye.

359
00:32:37,547 --> 00:32:41,922
You're right, Chucky.
She didn't believe me.

360
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,838
Hi. I like to be hugged.

361
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:55,130
Good. I'd love to hug you too.

362
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:10,255
Hey.

363
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:12,922
You sure you're all right
about last night?

364
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:15,505
No bad dreams about aunt Maggie?

365
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,838
And Chucky's only a doll, right?

366
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,338
All right, off to school with you, then.
I love you tons.

367
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,630
43rd street. Next stop, 47th.

368
00:35:34,588 --> 00:35:36,422
Is that Eddie's?

369
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:44,630
Look, you stay here. I have to go tinkle.

370
00:35:55,547 --> 00:35:57,797
I'll be right there, Chucky!

371
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,672
Chucky?

372
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:16,380
Chucky?

373
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:10,505
Chucky?

374
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:18,130
Chucky?

375
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,088
Chucky?

376
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,255
Chucky?

377
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,380
Chucky?

378
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,338
Chucky?

379
00:39:06,797 --> 00:39:09,005
- Mrs. Barclay?
- Oh, detective Norris.

380
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:10,713
I came as soon as I got your message.

381
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:12,898
You haven't been to school
to pick up your son yet?

382
00:39:12,922 --> 00:39:17,088
- No. No, I came directly from work. Why?
- Let's go into my office.

383
00:39:18,213 --> 00:39:20,213
- Is something wrong with Andy?
- Please.

384
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:24,505
I, uh...

385
00:39:28,713 --> 00:39:30,593
I don't know how to tell you this,
Mrs. Barclay.

386
00:39:30,922 --> 00:39:32,005
Tell me what?

387
00:39:32,422 --> 00:39:35,880
Do you have any idea why your
aunt Maggie fell out of that window?

388
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:38,422
- Yes.
- Could you tell me why?

389
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:44,380
'Cause she saw Chucky and
it scared her so much, she fell out.

390
00:39:44,547 --> 00:39:45,797
Oh, she did, huh?

391
00:39:46,797 --> 00:39:49,005
So why did Chucky go to see Eddie caputo?

392
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:52,463
- Mommy!
- Oh, Andy!

393
00:39:57,088 --> 00:39:58,922
All right, sweetheart. Come on.

394
00:40:01,213 --> 00:40:03,005
Now listen to me, okay?

395
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,005
Nobody believes you about Chucky.

396
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,005
Unless you start telling the truth
right now...

397
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:14,297
They're going to take you away from me.

398
00:40:17,505 --> 00:40:19,047
You hear that, Chucky?

399
00:40:19,213 --> 00:40:22,463
They're taking me away
unless you say something.

400
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,422
Please, say something.

401
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:31,172
Come on, Chucky! Say something!

402
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:35,005
Tell me why you lied to me
about everything.

403
00:40:35,172 --> 00:40:38,255
Come on, Chucky! Say something!

404
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:40,047
Tell me!

405
00:40:40,213 --> 00:40:43,755
Hi! I'm Chucky and
I'm your friend to the end.

406
00:40:43,922 --> 00:40:45,838
Hidey-ho.

407
00:40:47,255 --> 00:40:50,005
Mommy, he's doing it on purpose!

408
00:40:50,172 --> 00:40:54,338
He told me never to tell about him
or he'd kill me.

409
00:40:54,547 --> 00:40:56,981
Mrs. Barclay, my name is doctor ardmore.

410
00:40:57,005 --> 00:40:58,297
I'm from county general.

411
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:00,797
I've seen more than enough.

412
00:41:00,963 --> 00:41:03,422
Maybe Andy should spend
a couple of days with us.

413
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:45,630
Well, say something, you little... bastard.

414
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,588
Say something, damn it!

415
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:53,213
Hi. I like to be hugged.

416
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,838
"He wants you for a best friend."

417
00:42:37,505 --> 00:42:38,922
Yeah, sure.

418
00:43:38,172 --> 00:43:40,422
Hi. I'm Chucky! Want to play?

419
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:44,922
Talk to me.

420
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:47,922
Come on, talk!

421
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:52,797
I said talk to me, damn it! All right!

422
00:44:53,297 --> 00:44:55,005
Then I'm going to make you talk!

423
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:11,088
I said talk to me, dammit,
or else I'm gonna throw you in the fire!

424
00:45:12,005 --> 00:45:14,338
You stupid bitch! You filthy slut!

425
00:45:14,505 --> 00:45:16,672
I'll teach you to fuck with me!

426
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:19,505
No!

427
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,755
Stop!

428
00:46:50,547 --> 00:46:51,922
Oh, detective Norris!

429
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:54,314
Mrs. Barclay,
what are you doing back here?

430
00:46:54,338 --> 00:46:55,463
Andy was telling the truth.

431
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:57,838
Chucky is alive and
he killed Eddie caputo.

432
00:46:58,547 --> 00:46:59,547
What?

433
00:46:59,713 --> 00:47:00,856
I took him home to my apartment.

434
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,047
I was about to throw away the box that
he came in when the batteries fell out.

435
00:47:04,297 --> 00:47:06,880
Don't you see? He's been moving
and talking for days

436
00:47:07,047 --> 00:47:08,422
without any batteries in him.

437
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:11,755
- What are you talking about?
- How I found out the doll was alive.

438
00:47:11,922 --> 00:47:14,297
See, I threatened
to throw him into the fireplace

439
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:16,880
when all of a sudden,
he came alive in my hand.

440
00:47:17,047 --> 00:47:19,380
I dropped him, and he got up and
ran out of the apartment.

441
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,713
Good night, Mrs. Barclay.

442
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,547
Wait a minute! I am telling you the truth!

443
00:47:25,922 --> 00:47:27,356
He killed Maggie, he killed Eddie caputo.

444
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:31,172
Look, Mrs. Barclay! I sympathize with you.
I really do.

445
00:47:31,338 --> 00:47:34,338
I hated what happened in there today,
but lying is not gonna...

446
00:47:34,505 --> 00:47:37,047
Lying? Does this look like I'm lying?

447
00:47:38,797 --> 00:47:40,713
- How did you get those?
- Chucky bit me.

448
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,713
Oh, for god's sake!

449
00:47:43,922 --> 00:47:45,380
All right, don't believe me!

450
00:47:47,463 --> 00:47:49,213
- Where you goin'?
- To find Chucky!

451
00:47:50,047 --> 00:47:51,255
How you gonna do that?

452
00:47:51,422 --> 00:47:53,713
I bought it from a peddler where I work,
I'll start there.

453
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,320
That isn't a good part of town to be in
at this time of night!

454
00:47:56,797 --> 00:47:58,213
Mrs. Barclay, do you hear me?

455
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,380
You don't want to go down there
at this time of night!

456
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:07,838
Goddamn it!

457
00:49:06,755 --> 00:49:08,713
- Nah.
- Mm-mm.

458
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:24,297
What's she doin' here?

459
00:49:28,547 --> 00:49:30,422
Hey, excuse me.

460
00:49:30,588 --> 00:49:32,005
Mister!

461
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:35,755
Mister!

462
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:38,088
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Do you remember me?

463
00:49:38,255 --> 00:49:39,463
No, no.

464
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,064
I... I'm sor... I bought a doll from you

465
00:49:41,088 --> 00:49:43,481
in back of Carson's department store
with my friend, yesterday.

466
00:49:43,505 --> 00:49:45,547
- Doll?
- Yes. A good guy doll.

467
00:49:45,713 --> 00:49:48,838
- You sold it to me. Do you remember?
- Oh, yeah, a doll. What about it?

468
00:49:49,005 --> 00:49:51,630
- Where did you get it?
- What will you give me if I tell you?

469
00:49:51,797 --> 00:49:57,463
Well, I don't have much but
you're welcome to whatever I have.

470
00:50:00,422 --> 00:50:02,297
It's not enough. What else you got?

471
00:50:03,755 --> 00:50:05,963
- That's all I've got.
- All you got?

472
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:08,505
- What are you... yes.
- That's not all you got.

473
00:50:09,547 --> 00:50:11,088
- Wait a minute.
- No, you got a lot.

474
00:50:11,255 --> 00:50:13,088
No. No, no!

475
00:50:13,422 --> 00:50:17,047
- No! Wait! No! No, no - pig!

476
00:50:18,463 --> 00:50:21,672
- Christ, he's a cop!
- All right, what about the rest of you?

477
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:23,463
You wanna party too?

478
00:50:30,213 --> 00:50:32,481
All right, now, you want to answer
the lady's question now? Huh?

479
00:50:32,505 --> 00:50:34,505
Where did you get the doll?

480
00:50:34,672 --> 00:50:36,505
I don't know nothin' about no doll.

481
00:50:36,672 --> 00:50:38,148
You're not gonna know nothin'
about nothin' in a minute

482
00:50:38,172 --> 00:50:39,452
unless you talk to me, now talk!

483
00:50:39,547 --> 00:50:42,422
A burned-out toy store on wabash!
That's where I got it.

484
00:50:45,297 --> 00:50:46,505
Get outta here!

485
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,963
What's wrong?

486
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,005
Nothing.

487
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,680
Well, wait a minute. Something the peddler
said upset you. What was it?

488
00:50:57,755 --> 00:50:59,172
I just told you, nothing.

489
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:03,380
Goddamn it! My son's life
is at stake! Now, what was it?

490
00:51:05,213 --> 00:51:08,797
The place where he said he got the doll,
Charles Lee ray died there.

491
00:51:09,047 --> 00:51:10,463
Who?

492
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,797
The Lake Shore strangler. The man who
was partners with Eddie caputo.

493
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,130
- Whoa, hey. Where are you going now?
- Wabash and Van buren.

494
00:51:18,297 --> 00:51:20,439
There's nothing there.
It's an abandoned wreck of a store.

495
00:51:20,463 --> 00:51:21,463
Why don't you believe me?

496
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,172
It was struck by lightning
the night Charles Lee ray died.

497
00:51:27,088 --> 00:51:29,380
- How do you know that?
- Because I was there!

498
00:51:29,547 --> 00:51:31,380
I was the man who killed him!

499
00:51:38,213 --> 00:51:39,255
Why didn't you tell me?

500
00:51:40,838 --> 00:51:44,172
It's not exactly the kind of thing
you tell someone.

501
00:51:44,672 --> 00:51:47,630
Come on. Let me take you home.
You need some sleep.

502
00:51:48,297 --> 00:51:50,297
- Did he say anything? Anything at all?
- Who?

503
00:51:50,463 --> 00:51:51,922
- Charles Lee ray.
- Yeah.

504
00:51:52,088 --> 00:51:54,213
He threatened to kill me and Eddie caputo.

505
00:52:07,547 --> 00:52:09,880
Sorry you couldn't find anything
to help Andy.

506
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,213
I really am.

507
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,838
But I did. I found out
that Chucky is Charles Lee ray.

508
00:52:16,422 --> 00:52:18,713
The only thing I don't know
is how he got inside the doll.

509
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:23,572
- Good night, Mrs. Barclay.
- Where did Charles Lee ray live?

510
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,213
Look, please, will you
just get out of the car?

511
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,020
Hey, just tell me where he lived.

512
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,713
Don't you understand?
Andy's life depends on it.

513
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:35,047
730 stoney island, the south side.

514
00:52:35,213 --> 00:52:39,047
But I've already checked the place out.
There's nothing there. Now, good night.

515
00:52:39,213 --> 00:52:40,630
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

516
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:44,372
- Home. Get some sleep.
- No, you can't do that!

517
00:52:44,505 --> 00:52:46,672
Don't you see? You just said it.

518
00:52:47,005 --> 00:52:49,047
Chucky killed caputo. That leaves you.

519
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:51,672
- That does it.
- Oh, please listen to me.

520
00:52:56,547 --> 00:52:58,713
- Out.
- I am telling you the truth!

521
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,630
- Why won't you believe me?
- Because I'm sane, Mrs. Barclay,

522
00:53:01,797 --> 00:53:02,922
sane and rational.

523
00:53:04,922 --> 00:53:06,838
All right! All right!

524
00:53:07,005 --> 00:53:09,439
Do you remember what you said the
first night you met me in my apartment?

525
00:53:09,463 --> 00:53:11,231
- What about it?
- You said you didn't like loose ends.

526
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:12,338
Well, I'm a loose end.

527
00:53:12,505 --> 00:53:15,105
You can't just let go what I said tonight
without checking it out.

528
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,463
For the last time,
Mrs. Barclay, good night.

529
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,172
Oh, my...

530
00:54:15,713 --> 00:54:17,463
Good night, asshole.

531
00:55:04,547 --> 00:55:06,838
Oh, god!

532
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,505
Jeez! Look out!

533
00:56:06,005 --> 00:56:07,297
Hi, Mikey!

534
00:56:15,922 --> 00:56:19,463
Won't do 'ya any good,
Mikey! You can't hurt me!

535
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,838
Karen.

536
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:49,172
What are you doing here?

537
00:58:51,213 --> 00:58:53,005
After I talked to you last night,

538
00:58:53,213 --> 00:58:56,088
I decided to go back to the station
and pull Ray's file.

539
00:58:57,005 --> 00:59:00,297
I learned a couple of things.
His nickname was Chucky.

540
00:59:01,963 --> 00:59:03,838
He spent a lot of time with this man.

541
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,088
Now all we have to do is find him
before Chucky does.

542
00:59:22,838 --> 00:59:24,630
Hello, John.

543
00:59:26,505 --> 00:59:28,213
Over here!

544
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:32,047
It's me. Chucky.

545
00:59:32,547 --> 00:59:35,797
What d'ya think? The grigri work?

546
00:59:38,047 --> 00:59:41,797
You know, when I came here learning
all that stuff about how to beat death,

547
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:44,588
I thought maybe you were pullin' my chain.

548
00:59:44,755 --> 00:59:47,505
But not now. Uh-uh, not now.

549
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:50,588
- Only one problem.
- What?

550
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,755
This. I didn't think
anybody could hurt me.

551
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:56,672
But last night I got shot.

552
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,755
Know somethin'? It hurt.

553
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,672
It hurt like a son of a bitch.
It even bled.

554
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,588
Why's that, John?

555
01:00:05,713 --> 01:00:07,880
- You're turning human.
- What?

556
01:00:09,255 --> 01:00:11,963
The more time you spend in that body...

557
01:00:13,422 --> 01:00:15,047
The more human you become.

558
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:19,338
You mean I have to live out
the rest of my life in this body?

559
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:24,505
No fucking way! You got me
into this, you get me out!

560
01:00:25,797 --> 01:00:28,672
- I can't do that, Chucky.
- Why not?

561
01:00:29,172 --> 01:00:31,880
Because you're an abomination!

562
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:35,422
An outrage against nature!

563
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:38,005
You've perverted everything
I've taught you

564
01:00:38,172 --> 01:00:39,880
and used it for evil!

565
01:00:40,047 --> 01:00:41,922
And you have to be stopped!

566
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:48,588
You know, I thought
something like this might happen.

567
01:00:48,755 --> 01:00:51,755
- That's why I prepared for it.
- What are you talking about?

568
01:00:52,588 --> 01:00:54,422
Your own personal mojo, doc.

569
01:00:55,963 --> 01:00:58,422
- Give me that.
- Sure. How do you want it?

570
01:00:58,588 --> 01:00:59,838
Broken leg?

571
01:01:02,838 --> 01:01:06,838
Shouldn't tell your customers
where you hide things like this, John.

572
01:01:07,005 --> 01:01:09,047
Gets you in trouble every time.

573
01:01:09,588 --> 01:01:11,880
Now how do I get out of this body?

574
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:14,797
- No. I won't tell you.
- Yeah?

575
01:01:17,755 --> 01:01:21,213
Tell me or die, John. Your choice.

576
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:24,047
I'll tell you.

577
01:01:26,047 --> 01:01:29,088
You have to transfer your soul
out of the doll...

578
01:01:29,588 --> 01:01:33,505
Into that of the first human being you
revealed your true self to.

579
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,297
You mean the first person I let in on
the fact that I was really alive?

580
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:43,463
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

581
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:47,630
The first person I let in on my little
secret was a six-year-old kid.

582
01:01:47,797 --> 01:01:49,838
I'm gonna be six years old again.

583
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:54,422
Well, John, it's been fun, but I gotta go.

584
01:01:54,797 --> 01:01:57,588
I have a date with a six-year-old boy.

585
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:01,672
And you have a date with death.

586
01:02:05,297 --> 01:02:07,338
Solong, John.

587
01:02:31,963 --> 01:02:33,880
Hold it! Wait, wait.

588
01:02:41,797 --> 01:02:43,422
Oh, my god.

589
01:02:46,672 --> 01:02:48,088
- Too late.
- What?

590
01:02:49,255 --> 01:02:51,838
Must save the boy. Must...

591
01:02:54,588 --> 01:02:56,547
Must get his soul...

592
01:02:57,297 --> 01:03:00,255
Into him like he got into doll.

593
01:03:00,422 --> 01:03:01,422
What?

594
01:03:02,088 --> 01:03:05,922
You must stop him
before he can say the chant.

595
01:03:06,713 --> 01:03:09,213
Kill him before he can say it.

596
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,338
But how? How?

597
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:16,422
The heart. His heart is almost human.

598
01:03:18,588 --> 01:03:22,005
It's the only way. Through the heart.

599
01:03:39,713 --> 01:03:43,630
Help me! Help me!
Dr. Ardmore, Chucky's here!

600
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,963
Help me! He's coming to kill me!

601
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:58,297
He's here! Chucky's here!

602
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,338
I don't see anybody.

603
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,547
But doctor, Chucky's here.

604
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:06,380
And he's going to kill me.

605
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:14,005
But Chucky is here,
and he's going to kill me!

606
01:04:17,297 --> 01:04:19,463
He's gonna kill me.

607
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:22,922
Please don't leave me. Please.

608
01:05:19,547 --> 01:05:21,338
Andy! Stop!

609
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:23,630
Stop him!

610
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:38,713
Check the north corridor!

611
01:06:24,422 --> 01:06:26,713
Easy, Andy, easy.
It's all right, Andy. It's all right.

612
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,797
You're not gonna need this anymore.
All right?

613
01:06:30,672 --> 01:06:32,547
But I do! Chucky's in the room,

614
01:06:32,713 --> 01:06:34,422
- and he's trying to kill me!
- No, no.

615
01:06:34,588 --> 01:06:38,338
No, Andy. It's gonna be all right.
I'm here now. I'm gonna protect you.

616
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:41,630
Andy. Easy, boy, easy.

617
01:06:41,922 --> 01:06:43,422
Come on. Nobody's here.

618
01:06:43,755 --> 01:06:45,880
No, please! He'll kill you too.

619
01:06:46,172 --> 01:06:49,630
No. Please listen to me. Please!

620
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:52,505
Andy, now, this is just gonna sting you
for one second.

621
01:07:07,547 --> 01:07:12,338
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

622
01:07:16,963 --> 01:07:18,213
Stop.

623
01:07:35,338 --> 01:07:36,463
What happened?

624
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:38,963
Look, uh, miss, could you just excuse us
for a minute here,

625
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,422
- all right?
- What?

626
01:07:43,255 --> 01:07:44,255
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

627
01:07:44,422 --> 01:07:47,380
Fried him to a crisp with the electric
shock machine, and then he escaped.

628
01:07:47,755 --> 01:07:49,172
Escaped? Where?

629
01:07:49,338 --> 01:07:52,963
We don't know, but I bet she does.

630
01:07:57,922 --> 01:07:59,672
Chucky. You seen Chucky anywhere?

631
01:08:01,172 --> 01:08:02,963
- Who's Chucky?
- Kid's doll.

632
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:05,930
The same one that was at the station
house. Have you seen him anywhere?

633
01:08:06,047 --> 01:08:08,630
What am I gonna know about a
doll? Where are you goin'?

634
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,630
They think Andy did it.

635
01:08:13,797 --> 01:08:16,963
I know. The girl said that Chucky was here
and that he was looking for Andy.

636
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:18,963
- Where would Andy go?
- He'd go home.

637
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,523
I always told him to go there
if he was in trouble.

638
01:08:20,547 --> 01:08:21,547
Does he have a key?

639
01:08:21,713 --> 01:08:22,963
- It's under the mat.
- Come on.

640
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:24,450
Come on. We don't have much time.

641
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:51,172
Look, George.

642
01:08:51,338 --> 01:08:53,172
Some child left their doll
in the elevator.

643
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:54,338
Leave it alone.

644
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:56,672
Whoever left it there
will come back looking for it.

645
01:09:02,422 --> 01:09:04,213
Ugly doll.

646
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:07,338
Fuck you.

647
01:10:50,922 --> 01:10:52,547
Surprise!

648
01:11:24,338 --> 01:11:25,338
Batter up!

649
01:12:09,213 --> 01:12:12,463
Give me the power, I beg of you.

650
01:12:29,838 --> 01:12:31,255
Andy!

651
01:12:35,588 --> 01:12:37,273
Andy!

652
01:12:37,297 --> 01:12:38,797
- Andy?
- Andy!

653
01:12:38,963 --> 01:12:40,380
Andy, can you hear me?

654
01:12:47,297 --> 01:12:49,057
Andy!

655
01:12:49,463 --> 01:12:51,880
Andy!

656
01:12:58,005 --> 01:12:59,422
Andy!

657
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:01,880
Karen. Karen, are you all right?

658
01:13:07,338 --> 01:13:08,463
Just take care of Andy.

659
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:15,547
Karen. Karen.

660
01:13:15,755 --> 01:13:18,005
- Take this. Take it.
- Mike!

661
01:13:20,297 --> 01:13:21,880
Mommy.

662
01:14:21,797 --> 01:14:24,047
What's wrong? Gun jammed?

663
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:06,047
Andy! Andy, help me! The matches!

664
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,255
Andy! Please! Now!

665
01:15:21,588 --> 01:15:24,088
Andy, no, please.

666
01:15:24,588 --> 01:15:26,922
We're friends to the end. Remember?

667
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:30,797
This is the end, friend.

668
01:15:32,005 --> 01:15:33,588
No!

669
01:16:15,047 --> 01:16:16,588
Oh, my baby.

670
01:16:16,755 --> 01:16:18,713
Karen? Andy?

671
01:16:19,047 --> 01:16:20,297
You all right?

672
01:16:25,922 --> 01:16:27,297
Oh!

673
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:31,172
Andy. Go get me the first-aid kit
under the kitchen sink really fast, okay?

674
01:16:31,672 --> 01:16:35,297
- What happened?
- Oh, god. Chucky's dead.

675
01:16:47,547 --> 01:16:50,547
Mommy, Chucky's gone.

676
01:16:51,338 --> 01:16:53,297
Andy, hurry up.

677
01:16:54,505 --> 01:16:55,547
Andy?

678
01:17:09,713 --> 01:17:11,380
Hello, Andy.

679
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,672
Mommy.

680
01:17:16,588 --> 01:17:17,797
Mommy.

681
01:17:19,338 --> 01:17:20,588
Mommy!

682
01:17:24,422 --> 01:17:26,547
Give me the boy and I'll let you live!

683
01:17:26,713 --> 01:17:29,547
Do you hear me? Give me the boy!

684
01:17:53,047 --> 01:17:54,213
Mommy!

685
01:18:16,547 --> 01:18:17,547
Oh!

686
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:28,922
Give me the boy!

687
01:19:38,297 --> 01:19:39,856
What the hell's goin' on here?

688
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,922
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

689
01:19:42,088 --> 01:19:43,130
Karen!

690
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:47,422
God!

691
01:19:50,505 --> 01:19:51,963
Oh, Jesus.

692
01:19:56,088 --> 01:19:57,856
Yeah, I got a cop down here,
multiple stab wounds.

693
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,713
At the Brewster apartments
on north grand street. Make it fast.

694
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:04,314
All right, they're gonna be here
in ten minutes, now tell me what happened.

695
01:20:04,338 --> 01:20:06,838
The kid was right. The doll's alive.

696
01:20:07,213 --> 01:20:09,933
- He almost got the three of us.
- C'mon, what are you talking about?

697
01:20:11,422 --> 01:20:14,797
You don't believe me? All right, well,
go on. Check it out in the hall.

698
01:20:14,963 --> 01:20:19,088
He's scattered all over the place.
But don't touch it. Do you understand me?

699
01:20:19,338 --> 01:20:22,380
- Don't you touch one part of it!
- All right, look. Take it easy, okay?

700
01:20:22,547 --> 01:20:24,338
Just relax yourself, all right? All right.

701
01:21:03,547 --> 01:21:06,130
Okay, Mike. I'd like you to take a look
at this thing, okay?

702
01:21:06,297 --> 01:21:08,380
Because there's no way this thing's alive.

703
01:21:10,172 --> 01:21:13,172
- I thought I told you not to touch it.
- Mike, will you be sensible?

704
01:21:13,338 --> 01:21:15,672
Come on, look. It's as dead as they come.
It's dead!

705
01:21:17,255 --> 01:21:22,130
Kill him! Choke him! Kill him!
Rip his throat out!

706
01:21:22,588 --> 01:21:24,672
Kill him! Kill him!

707
01:21:26,338 --> 01:21:28,005
Kill him!

708
01:21:32,338 --> 01:21:37,463
Kill him now! Strangle him!
Don't let go!

709
01:21:42,713 --> 01:21:43,713
God.

710
01:21:52,505 --> 01:21:55,213
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them all!

711
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:57,505
The heart! Shoot him in the heart!

712
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,255
Hi. I'm Chucky.

713
01:22:25,422 --> 01:22:29,630
Wanna play...

714
01:22:39,338 --> 01:22:42,380
- You believe me now?
- Yeah.

715
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,672
But who's gonna believe me?

716
01:22:51,588 --> 01:22:52,588
Come on.

717
01:22:55,297 --> 01:22:57,505
All right. Ready? Here we go.

718
01:23:18,005 --> 01:23:21,922
Andy. Come on. We're gonna
go to the hospital with Mike.

719
01:23:22,672 --> 01:23:24,130
Let's go.
