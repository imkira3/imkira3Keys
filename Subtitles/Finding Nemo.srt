2
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:02,256
Yes, Marlin.

3
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:04,391
No, I see it. It's beautiful.

4
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:06,959
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view...

5
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:11,167
you didn't think you'd get
the whole ocean, did you?

6
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:16,008
Oh, yeah.
A fish can breathe out here.

7
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:17,979
Did your man deliver,
or did he deliver?

8
00:01:18,014 --> 00:01:20,312
- My man delivered.
- And it wasn't so easy.

9
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,649
Because a lot of other clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

10
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:26,120
You better believe they did...
every single one of them.

11
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:28,180
You did good.

12
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:30,852
And the neighborhood
is awesome.

13
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,531
So, you do like it, don't you?

14
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:46,030
No, no. I do, I do.
I really do like it.

15
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:49,010
But, Marlin, I know that
the drop off is desirable...

16
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:51,309
with the great schools
and the amazing view...

17
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:53,416
but do we really need
so much space?

18
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:56,247
Coral, honey, these are our kids
we're talking about.

19
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:58,447
They deserve the best.
Look, look, look.

20
00:01:58,488 --> 00:02:00,718
They'll wake up,
poke their little heads out...

21
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:03,824
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

22
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,158
You'll wake the kids.

23
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:07,992
Oh, right, right.

24
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:16,501
Aw, look. They're dreaming.

25
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,700
We still have to name them.

26
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:20,504
You want to name
all of them right now?

27
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:23,808
All right, we'll name
this half Marlin Junior...

28
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:25,973
and this half Coral Junior.

29
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:28,575
- OK, we're done.
- I like Nemo.

30
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:31,382
Nemo. We'll name one Nemo...

31
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:33,981
but I'd like most of them
to be Marlin Junior.

32
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:35,388
Just think,
in a couple of days...

33
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:38,917
- we're going to be parents.
- Yeah.

34
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:40,588
What if they don't like me?

35
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,154
- Marlin.
- No, really.

36
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:47,158
There's over 400 eggs.
Odds are, one will like you.

37
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,500
What?

38
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,170
- You remember how we met?
- I try not to.

39
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:56,678
Well, I remember.
"Excuse me, miss..."

40
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:59,181
"can you check and see
if I have a hook in my lip?"

41
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:01,581
You got a little closer
because it was wiggling.

42
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:04,745
- Get away, get away!
- Here he is. Cutie's here.

43
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:08,715
Where did everybody go?

44
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:17,591
Coral, get inside the house.

45
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:21,535
No, Coral, don't.
They'll be fine.

46
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:24,165
Just get inside...
You, right now.

47
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:28,808
No!

48
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,592
Coral!

49
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:56,071
Coral?

50
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,572
Coral?

51
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:07,711
Coral?

52
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:11,484
Coral?

53
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:19,188
Coral?

54
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:43,749
There, there, there.

55
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:46,277
It's OK. Daddy's here.

56
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:49,184
Daddy's got you.

57
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:56,556
I promise, I will never
let anything happen to you...

58
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:58,362
Nemo.

59
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:37,272
First day of school!

60
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:40,071
Wake up, wake up!
First day of school.

61
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,600
I don't want to go to school...
five more minutes.

62
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:43,907
Not you, Dad, me.

63
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:45,345
- OK?
- Get up, get up.

64
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:48,077
It's time for school,
time for school.

65
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:49,675
All right, I'm up.

66
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,149
- Nemo!
- First day of school!

67
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:55,350
Nemo, don't move.

68
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,790
You'll never get out
of there yourself.

69
00:05:56,826 --> 00:05:58,987
I'll do it.

70
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:00,996
- You feel a break?
- No.

71
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,759
Sometimes you can't tell
'cause fluid rushes to the area.

72
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:04,993
- Are you woozy?
- No.

73
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:07,298
- How many stripes do I have?
- I'm fine.

74
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:09,133
- Answer the stripe question.
- Three.

75
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:10,638
No! See?
Something's wrong with you.

76
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:13,471
I have one, two, three...
That's all I have?

77
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,410
You're OK. How's the lucky fin?

78
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:19,243
- Lucky.
- Let's see.

79
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,206
Are you sure you want to go
to school this year?

80
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:25,152
There's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

81
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:27,052
Come on, Dad,
it's time for school.

82
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,751
Forgot to brush.

83
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,783
Do you want this anemone
to sting you?

84
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:34,227
- Yes.
- Brush.

85
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:35,924
- OK, I'm done.
- You missed a spot.

86
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:37,926
- Where?
- There.

87
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,936
Right there. And here and here.

88
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:51,072
All right, we're excited.

89
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:52,876
The first day of school.
Here we go.

90
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:54,883
We're ready to learn
to get some knowledge.

91
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:57,317
What's the one thing we have
to remember about the ocean?

92
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:59,787
- It's not safe.
- That's my boy.

93
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:02,086
First, we check to see
that the coast is clear.

94
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:04,524
We go out... and back in.

95
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,858
And then we go out...
and back in.

96
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:09,922
And then one more time...
out and back in.

97
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,797
And sometimes, if you want
to do it four times...

98
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:14,200
- Dad...
- All right, come on, boy.

99
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:20,000
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.

100
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:22,704
- I highly doubt that.
- Have you ever met a shark?

101
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:24,406
No, and I don't plan to.

102
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:27,644
- How old are sea turtles?
- I don't know.

103
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:29,378
Sandy Plankton
from next door...

104
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:32,320
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

105
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:34,755
He says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

106
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,054
If I ever meet a sea turtle,
I'll ask him.

107
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:39,027
After I'm done
talking to the shark, OK?

108
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:42,630
Hold on. Wait to cross.

109
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:44,893
Hold my fin.

110
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,265
Dad, you're not
going to freak out...

111
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:48,293
like you did at
the petting zoo, are you?

112
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:51,101
That snail was about to charge.

113
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,574
I wonder where
we're supposed to go.

114
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,099
Bye, Mom!

115
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:57,237
I'll pick you up after school.

116
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:02,075
Come on, you guys, stop it!
Give it back!

117
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:05,110
Come on, we'll try over there.

118
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:08,514
Excuse me, is this where
we meet his teacher?

119
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:11,082
Well, look who's out
of the anemone.

120
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:12,327
Yes. Shocking, I know.

121
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,124
- Marty, right?
- Marlin.

122
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:15,323
- Bob.
- Ted.

123
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,355
Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish.

124
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,960
You're funny, right?
Tell us a joke.

125
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:21,299
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

126
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:24,238
Well, actually,
that's a common misconception.

127
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:26,798
Clownfish are no funnier
than any other fish.

128
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:28,833
- Come on, clownie.
- Do something funny.

129
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:31,346
All right, I know one joke.

130
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,441
There's a mollusk, see?
And he walks up to a sea...

131
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:37,543
He doesn't walk up,
he swims up.

132
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,451
Actually,
the mollusk isn't moving.

133
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:43,049
He's in one place,
and then the sea cucumber...

134
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:44,559
Well, they... I'm mixed up.

135
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:47,323
There was a mollusk
and a sea cucumber.

136
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:48,964
None of them were walking,
so forget that I...

137
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:52,195
Sheldon! Get out of
Mr. Johannsen's yard now!

138
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:54,600
All right, you kids!

139
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:57,697
Where'd you go?

140
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,901
Dad, can I go play, too? Can I?

141
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:02,934
I would feel better if
you'd play on the sponge beds.

142
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:09,484
That's where I would play.

143
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,554
- What's wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.

144
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:15,955
Hey, what'd I do?

145
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:17,959
Be nice.
It's his first time at school.

146
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:20,689
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

147
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,991
- Dad...
- See this tentacle?

148
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:25,159
It's actually shorter
than all my other tentacles...

149
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:27,328
but you can't really tell.

150
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:29,803
Especially when
I twirl them like this.

151
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,898
I'm H-2-O intolerant.

152
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:33,909
I'm obnoxious.

153
00:09:35,544 --> 00:09:38,377
Let's name the zones,
the zones, the zones

154
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:41,577
Let's name
the zones of the open sea

155
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:42,811
Mr. Ray!

156
00:09:42,852 --> 00:09:45,753
- Come on, Nemo.
- You better stay with me.

157
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:47,653
Mesopelagic, bathyal,
abyssalpelagic

158
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,126
All the rest are too deep
for you and me to see

159
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,493
I wonder where
my class has gone?

160
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,259
We're under here!

161
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:58,163
Oh, there you are.

162
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,758
Climb aboard, explorers.

163
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:01,099
Oh, knowledge exploring

164
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:02,627
is, oh, so lyrical

165
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:05,105
When you think thoughts
that are empirical

166
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:06,301
Dad, you can go now.

167
00:10:06,342 --> 00:10:09,436
- Hello. Who is this?
- I'm Nemo.

168
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:13,141
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

169
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:15,980
- OK.
- You live in what kind of home?

170
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:17,713
An anemon-none.

171
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:19,744
A nemenem-menome.

172
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,815
OK, don't hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard, explorers.

173
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:24,792
Just so you know,
he's got a little fin.

174
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,488
I find if he's having
trouble swimming...

175
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,497
I let him take a break,
10, 15 minutes.

176
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,965
Dad, it's time
for you to go now.

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,059
Don't worry. We're gonna
stay together as a group.

178
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:35,502
OK, class,
optical orbits up front.

179
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:38,530
And remember, we keep
our supraesophogeal ganglion...

180
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:41,008
to ourselves.
That means you, Jimmy.

181
00:10:41,143 --> 00:10:43,008
Aw, man!

182
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:45,070
Bye, Nemo!

183
00:10:45,114 --> 00:10:46,513
Bye, Dad!

184
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:48,210
Bye, son!

185
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:52,216
Be safe.

186
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:54,814
You're doing pretty well
for a first-timer.

187
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:57,189
You can't hold on to them
forever, can you?

188
00:10:57,226 --> 00:10:59,456
I had a tough time with
my oldest out at the drop off.

189
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:01,759
They got to grow up...
The drop off?

190
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:04,664
They're going to the drop off?
What are you, insane?

191
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,999
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

192
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:09,299
Hey, Marty, calm down.

193
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:11,602
Don't tell me
to be calm, pony boy.

194
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,938
Pony boy?

195
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:16,843
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

196
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,278
Pity.

197
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:22,776
Let's name the species,
the species, the species

198
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:24,115
Let's name the species
that live in the sea

199
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:27,151
There's

200
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:29,248
Porifera, coelenterata,
hydrozoa, scyphozoa

201
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,350
Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three

202
00:11:31,393 --> 00:11:34,055
Gastropoda, arthropoda,
echinoderma

203
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:35,393
And some fish like you and me

204
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:36,762
Come on, sing with me.

205
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:45,871
Just the girls this time.

206
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:47,876
Oh, seaweed is cool

207
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,172
Seaweed is fun

208
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:50,678
it makes its food

209
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,008
OK, the drop off.

210
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:58,315
All right, kids,
feel free to explore...

211
00:11:58,354 --> 00:11:59,514
but stay close.

212
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:01,750
Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather.

213
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:05,822
An entire ecosystem contained
in one infinitesimal speck.

214
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:07,522
There are as many protein pairs
contained in this...

215
00:12:07,563 --> 00:12:09,997
Come on, let's go.

216
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:11,397
Come on, sing with me!

217
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,697
There's porifera, coelenterata

218
00:12:13,736 --> 00:12:15,203
Hydrozoa, scyphozoa

219
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:16,805
Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three

220
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:19,865
Hey, guys, wait up!

221
00:12:24,813 --> 00:12:26,906
Cool.

222
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:30,211
Saved your life!

223
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:32,584
Aw, you guys made me ink.

224
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:35,456
What's that?

225
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:39,918
I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

226
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:43,056
He said it was called a butt.

227
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,864
That's a pretty big butt.

228
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:51,534
Oh, look at me.
I'm going to touch the butt.

229
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:56,874
Oh, yeah?
Let's see you get closer.

230
00:12:56,912 --> 00:12:58,539
OK.

231
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,071
Beat that.

232
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:03,641
Come on, Nemo.
How far can you go?

233
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:06,154
My dad says it's not safe.

234
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:09,123
- Nemo! No!
- Dad?

235
00:13:09,158 --> 00:13:10,591
You were about
to swim into open water.

236
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:11,854
No, I wasn't...

237
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:13,725
Good thing I was here.
If I hadn't shown up...

238
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:16,026
- He wasn't going to go.
- He was too afraid.

239
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:17,362
No, I wasn't.

240
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,832
This does not
concern you, kids...

241
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,233
and you're lucky
I don't tell your parents.

242
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,567
You know you can't swim well.

243
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:24,538
I can swim fine, Dad, OK?

244
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:27,474
No, it's not OK.
You shouldn't be near here.

245
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,909
OK, I was right. You'll start
school in a year or two.

246
00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:32,675
No, Dad! Just because
you're scared of the ocean...

247
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:33,882
Clearly, you're not ready...

248
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,076
and you're not coming back
until you are.

249
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:36,379
You think
you can do these things...

250
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:38,318
but you just can't, Nemo!

251
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:41,247
I hate you.

252
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,086
There's

253
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,958
Nothing to see.
Gather. Over there.

254
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:48,258
Excuse me.
Is there anything I can do?

255
00:13:48,297 --> 00:13:50,356
I am a scientist, sir.
Is there any problem?

256
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,492
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt things.

257
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:55,367
He isn't a good swimmer,
and it's a little too soon...

258
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:57,133
for him to be out here
unsupervised.

259
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:58,935
I can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

260
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:01,943
I'm sure he is,
but you have a large class...

261
00:14:01,977 --> 00:14:04,810
and he can get lost from sight
if you're not looking.

262
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:06,047
I'm not saying
you're not looking.

263
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:09,016
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea!

264
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:12,081
Nemo!

265
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:15,184
What do you think you're doing?

266
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:18,022
You'll get stuck out there...

267
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,552
and I'll have to get you
before another fish does.

268
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:23,494
Get back here!

269
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:26,524
I said get back here now!

270
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:31,403
Stop! You take
one more move, mister...

271
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,305
Don't you dare!

272
00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:35,401
If you put one fin
on that boat...

273
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:36,934
Are you listening to me?

274
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:40,608
Don't touch the bo... Nemo!

275
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,276
He touched the butt.

276
00:14:42,317 --> 00:14:45,047
You paddle your little tail
right back here, Nemo.

277
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,247
That's right.

278
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:47,983
You are in big trouble,
young man.

279
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:49,820
Do you hear me? Big...

280
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:53,595
Big...

281
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:58,891
Daddy! Help me!

282
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:01,903
I'm coming, Nemo!

283
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:05,139
Get under me, kids!

284
00:15:05,174 --> 00:15:06,573
Oh! No!

285
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:08,303
Dad!

286
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:10,743
Daddy!

287
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:16,849
Oh! Nemo!

288
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:21,279
Nemo!

289
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:24,952
Nemo, no! Nemo!

290
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:27,962
Nemo! Nemo! No!

291
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:32,356
No!

292
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,800
Nemo! Nemo!

293
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:54,317
Hold on.

294
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:08,330
Oh, no.

295
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,964
No. No, it's gone. It's gone.

296
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:12,303
No, no, it can't be gone.

297
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:14,673
No, no! Nemo!

298
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,310
Nemo! Nemo!

299
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:17,903
Nemo! Nemo!

300
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:20,176
No!

301
00:16:20,282 --> 00:16:22,876
Nemo! Nemo!

302
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:25,716
No! No, please, no!

303
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:29,718
No, no!

304
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,651
Has anybody seen a boat?

305
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:35,526
Please! A white boat!

306
00:16:35,564 --> 00:16:37,225
They took my son!

307
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,767
My son! Help me, please.

308
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:41,668
- Look out!
- What?

309
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:47,734
Oh, oh. Sorry.
I didn't see you.

310
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:51,075
- Sir? Are you OK?
- He's gone, he's gone.

311
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:52,546
There, there. It's all right.

312
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:53,843
- He's gone.
- It'll be OK.

313
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:57,443
No, no. They took him away.
I have to find the boat.

314
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:59,545
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.

315
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:01,886
- You have?
- It passed by not too long ago.

316
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:04,290
- A white one?
- Hi. I'm Dory.

317
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:05,520
Where? Which way?

318
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:07,722
It went this way.

319
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:09,162
It went this way. Follow me.

320
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:12,565
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you so much.

321
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:13,727
No problem.

322
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:40,319
Hey...

323
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:41,761
Wait!

324
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:49,962
- Will you quit it?
- What?

325
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:52,769
I'm trying to swim here.
Ocean isn't big enough for you?

326
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:55,006
You got a problem, buddy?

327
00:17:55,043 --> 00:17:57,739
Do you? Do you?
You want a piece of me?

328
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,644
I'm scared now. What?

329
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:02,275
- Wait a minute.
- Stop following me, OK?

330
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:05,445
What? You're showing me
where the boat went.

331
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:07,089
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.

332
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:10,519
It passed by not too long ago.
It went this way.

333
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,958
It went this way. Follow me.

334
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:14,121
Wait a minute.
What is going on?

335
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:16,460
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

336
00:18:16,498 --> 00:18:19,695
I did? Oh, no.

337
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:22,033
If this is some kind of
practical joke, it's not funny.

338
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,368
And I know funny.
I'm a clownfish.

339
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:27,807
No, it's not. I know it's not.
I'm so sorry.

340
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:30,812
See, I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

341
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:34,680
Short-term memory loss.
I don't believe this.

342
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:36,581
No, it's true. I forget things
almost instantly.

343
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:40,577
It runs in my family.
At least, I think it does.

344
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:44,649
Where are they?

345
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:50,831
Can I help you?

346
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:53,494
Something's wrong
with you... really.

347
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:55,400
You're wasting my time.

348
00:18:55,437 --> 00:18:57,496
I have to find my son.

349
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:02,300
Hello.

350
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:04,335
Well, hi!

351
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:07,405
Name's Bruce.

352
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:09,212
It's all right. I understand.

353
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:12,982
Why trust a shark, right?

354
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:23,156
So, what's a couple
of bites like you...

355
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:24,859
doing out so late, eh?

356
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,925
We're not doing anything.
We're not even out.

357
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:29,198
Great!
Then how'd you morsels...

358
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:32,502
like to come to a little
get-together I'm having?

359
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,735
You mean, like a party?

360
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:37,836
Yeah, right. A party.
What do you say?

361
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:40,040
I love parties.
That sounds like fun.

362
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:42,482
Parties are fun,
and it's tempting, but...

363
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:46,419
Oh, come on, I insist.

364
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:49,652
OK. That's all that matters.

365
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:54,455
Hey, look, balloons.
It is a party.

366
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:56,828
Mind your distance, though.

367
00:19:56,865 --> 00:19:59,527
Those balloons
can be a bit dodgy.

368
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:01,866
You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

369
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:18,445
Anchor! Chum!

370
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:21,285
There you are, Bruce. Finally.

371
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:23,985
- We got company.
- It's about time, mate.

372
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:25,493
We've already gone
through the snacks...

373
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:27,085
and I'm still starving.

374
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:29,324
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

375
00:20:29,364 --> 00:20:31,093
Come on,
let's get this over with.

376
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:33,926
Right, then.

377
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:36,267
The meeting has officially
come to order.

378
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:37,794
Let us all say the pledge.

379
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,333
I am a nice shark,
not a mindless eating machine.

380
00:20:42,377 --> 00:20:45,005
If I am to change this image...

381
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:47,480
I must first change myself.

382
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:50,246
Fish are friends, not food.

383
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:51,616
Except stinkin' dolphins.

384
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:54,679
Dolphins. Yeah.
They think they're so cute.

385
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:56,452
"Look at me.
I'm a flippin' little dolphin."

386
00:20:56,491 --> 00:20:58,152
"Let me flip for you.
Ain't I something?"

387
00:20:58,193 --> 00:21:00,787
Right, then.
Today's meeting is Step 5...

388
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:02,490
Bring a Fish Friend.

389
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:04,021
Do you all have your friends?

390
00:21:04,065 --> 00:21:05,225
Got mine.

391
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:09,228
- Hey, there.
- How about you, Chum?

392
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:13,799
Oh, I... seem to have
misplaced my friend.

393
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,775
That's all right, Chum.

394
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:18,336
I had a feeling
this would be a difficult step.

395
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,904
You can help yourself
to one of my friends.

396
00:21:19,948 --> 00:21:23,406
Thanks, mate.
A little chum for Chum?

397
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:25,113
I'll start the testimonies.

398
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:27,383
Hello. My name is Bruce.

399
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:28,684
Hello, Bruce.

400
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:30,884
It has been three weeks
since my last fish.

401
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:34,362
On my honor, or may I be
chopped up and made into soup.

402
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:37,160
- You're an inspiration!
- Amen.

403
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,833
Right, then. Who's next?

404
00:21:39,868 --> 00:21:41,165
Pick me, pick me.

405
00:21:41,203 --> 00:21:43,068
Yes. The little
Sheila down the front.

406
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:45,163
Come on up here.

407
00:21:46,141 --> 00:21:48,006
Hi. I'm Dory.

408
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:50,443
- Hello, Dory.
- And well...

409
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:53,642
I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.

410
00:21:53,682 --> 00:21:57,243
- That's incredible.
- Good on you, mate.

411
00:21:57,285 --> 00:21:59,310
I'm glad
I got that off my chest.

412
00:21:59,354 --> 00:22:00,685
All right, anyone else?

413
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:03,316
How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

414
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:05,588
Me? I don't have a problem.

415
00:22:05,627 --> 00:22:06,992
Oh, OK.

416
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:08,620
Denial.

417
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:10,494
Just start with your name.

418
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:13,228
OK. Hello.

419
00:22:13,268 --> 00:22:16,362
My name is Marlin.
I'm a clownfish.

420
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:19,430
- A clownfish? Really?
- Tell us a joke.

421
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:21,203
I love jokes.

422
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:24,235
I actually do know one
that's pretty good.

423
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,304
There was this mollusk...

424
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:28,680
and he walks up
to a sea cucumber.

425
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:30,548
Normally, they don't talk,
sea cucumbers...

426
00:22:30,585 --> 00:22:32,553
but in a joke,
everyone talks...

427
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:35,647
so the sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

428
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,953
Daddy!

429
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:41,326
Nemo!

430
00:22:41,363 --> 00:22:44,389
Nemo! Nemo! I don't get it.

431
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:46,332
For a clownfish,
he's not that funny.

432
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:48,199
No, no, no, no. He's my son.

433
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:50,295
He was taken by these divers.

434
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:53,034
Oh, my. You poor fish.

435
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:55,042
Humans... think they own
everything.

436
00:22:55,076 --> 00:22:56,338
Probably American.

437
00:22:56,378 --> 00:23:00,479
Now, there is a father...
Looking for his little boy.

438
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:03,040
What do these markings mean?

439
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:05,416
I never knew my father!

440
00:23:05,453 --> 00:23:07,853
- Group hug.
- We're all mates here, mate.

441
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:09,117
I can't read human.

442
00:23:09,157 --> 00:23:10,419
We got to find a fish
that can read this.

443
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,426
- Hey, look, sharks.
- No, no, no, Dory!

444
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,587
- Guys, guys.
- No, Dory.

445
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:15,960
That's mine. Give it to me.

446
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:17,464
Gimme!

447
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:19,467
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you OK?

448
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:20,899
I'm so sorry.

449
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:23,063
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

450
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,601
Dory, are you OK...

451
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:29,444
That's good.

452
00:23:29,445 --> 00:23:32,174
That's good.

453
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:34,113
Intervention!

454
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:36,743
- Just a bite.
- Hold it together, mate!

455
00:23:36,785 --> 00:23:39,413
Remember, Bruce,
fish are friends, not food!

456
00:23:39,454 --> 00:23:42,356
- Food!
- Dory, look out!

457
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,951
I'm having fish tonight!

458
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,586
Remember the steps, mate!

459
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:55,665
Just one bite!

460
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,506
G'day. Grr!

461
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:04,807
There's no way out!

462
00:24:04,846 --> 00:24:06,609
There's got to be a way
to escape!

463
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:10,150
Who is it?

464
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:11,516
Dory, help me find a way out!

465
00:24:11,553 --> 00:24:14,078
Sorry. Come back later.
We're trying to escape.

466
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:18,690
- There's got to be a way out!
- Here's something.

467
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:21,457
"Es-cap-e."
I wonder what that means.

468
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:23,020
Funny. It's spelled
just like "escape."

469
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:24,326
Let's go.

470
00:24:24,366 --> 00:24:27,460
Here's Brucey!

471
00:24:27,502 --> 00:24:29,197
Wait a minute. You can read?

472
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:31,228
I can read?
That's right. I can read!

473
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:33,399
Well, then, here.
Read this now.

474
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:38,207
He really doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

475
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:39,474
Don't fall off the wagon!

476
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:45,987
Oh, no, it's blocked!

477
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:51,522
No, Bruce, focus.

478
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,686
Sorry about Bruce, mate.

479
00:24:53,728 --> 00:24:56,390
He's really a nice guy.

480
00:24:56,431 --> 00:24:57,659
I need to get that mask.

481
00:24:57,699 --> 00:24:59,291
You want that mask? OK.

482
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:02,098
No, no, no, no, no, no!

483
00:25:02,137 --> 00:25:04,662
Quick, grab the mask!

484
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:11,376
Oh, no. Bruce?

485
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:13,040
What?

486
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:17,614
Swim away! Swim away!

487
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:19,381
Aw, is the party over?

488
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,664
Nice.

489
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,919
Dad?

490
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:38,957
Daddy?

491
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,754
Barbara.

492
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:05,620
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

493
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:08,092
And I'm going to need
a few more cotton rolls.

494
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:09,754
OK.

495
00:26:11,497 --> 00:26:13,226
Hello, little fella.

496
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,660
Beauty, isn't he?

497
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:17,032
I found that guy
struggling for life...

498
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:18,764
out on the reef,
and I saved him.

499
00:26:18,804 --> 00:26:20,897
So, has that Novocaine
kicked in yet?

500
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,137
I think so.
We're ready to roll.

501
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:26,901
Bubbles!

502
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:31,474
My bubbles.

503
00:26:31,517 --> 00:26:32,882
He likes bubbles.

504
00:26:32,918 --> 00:26:36,615
No!

505
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,624
Bonjour.

506
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:49,464
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

507
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:52,732
- He's scared to death.
- I want to go home.

508
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:54,796
Do you know where my dad is?

509
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,604
Honey, your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

510
00:26:57,643 --> 00:26:58,803
Pet store?

511
00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:01,540
Yeah, you know, like,
I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

512
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,138
- Pet Palace.
- Fish-O-Rama.

513
00:27:03,182 --> 00:27:04,649
- Mail order.
- Ebay.

514
00:27:04,683 --> 00:27:07,379
- So, which one is it?
- I'm from the ocean.

515
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:09,353
The ocean. The ocean?

516
00:27:11,323 --> 00:27:14,019
He hasn't been decontaminated.
Jacques!

517
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:15,390
- Oui.
- Clean him!

518
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:16,951
Oui.

519
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:19,430
- Ocean.
- La mer. Bon.

520
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,393
Voila. He is clean.

521
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:29,136
The big blue. What's it like?

522
00:27:29,174 --> 00:27:33,201
- Big and blue?
- I knew it.

523
00:27:33,245 --> 00:27:36,442
If there's anything you need,
just ask your Auntie Deb.

524
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:39,576
Or if I'm not around,
you can talk to my sister Flo.

525
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:41,381
Hi. How are you?

526
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,944
Don't listen to anything
my sister says.

527
00:27:42,988 --> 00:27:44,819
She's nuts.

528
00:27:44,857 --> 00:27:45,949
We got a live one.

529
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:49,017
- Can't hear you, Peach.
- I said we got a live one.

530
00:27:49,061 --> 00:27:51,029
- Boy, oh, boy.
- What do we got?

531
00:27:51,063 --> 00:27:52,587
Root canal... and by the looks
of those x-rays...

532
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,098
it's not going to be pretty.

533
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:57,301
- Dam and clamp installed?
- Yep.

534
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:59,133
- What did he use to open?
- Gator-Glidden drill.

535
00:27:59,171 --> 00:28:00,832
He seems to favor
that one lately.

536
00:28:00,873 --> 00:28:03,808
I can't see, Flo.

537
00:28:03,842 --> 00:28:05,969
You're getting a little too...

538
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:07,205
Now he's doing
the Schilder technique.

539
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:08,645
He's using a Hedstrom file.

540
00:28:08,681 --> 00:28:10,876
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

541
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,544
It has a teardrop cross-section.
Clearly a Hedstrom.

542
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:15,075
- No, no, K-Flex.
- Hedstrom.

543
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,815
- K-Flex!
- Hedstrom!

544
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:18,914
There I go.
A little help, over here.

545
00:28:19,024 --> 00:28:20,821
I'll go deflate him.

546
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:25,423
All right. Go ahead and rinse.

547
00:28:25,464 --> 00:28:28,797
Oh, the human mouth
is a disgusting place.

548
00:28:31,236 --> 00:28:33,170
- Hey, Nigel.
- What did I miss?

549
00:28:33,205 --> 00:28:34,365
Root canal... a doozy.

550
00:28:34,406 --> 00:28:36,033
Root canal?
What did he use to open?

551
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:38,100
- Gator-Glidden drill.
- He's favoring that one.

552
00:28:38,143 --> 00:28:41,135
Hope he doesn't get surplus
sealer at the portal terminus.

553
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,274
- Hello. Who's this?
- New guy.

554
00:28:44,316 --> 00:28:45,647
The dentist
took him off the reef.

555
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:48,050
An outie. From my neck
of the woods, eh?

556
00:28:48,087 --> 00:28:49,577
Sorry if I ever took
a snap at you.

557
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:51,020
Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta eat.

558
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:52,751
Hey! No, no, no, no!

559
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:54,383
They're not your fish.
They're my fish.

560
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:57,224
Come on, go. Go on, shoo!

561
00:28:58,564 --> 00:29:00,225
Aw, the picture broke.

562
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:02,324
This here's Darla.
She's my niece.

563
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:03,834
She's going to be
eight this week.

564
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:05,336
Hey, little fella.

565
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,133
Say hello to your new mummy.

566
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:09,640
She'll be here Friday
to pick you up.

567
00:29:09,675 --> 00:29:11,506
You're her present.

568
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,602
It's our little secret.

569
00:29:13,645 --> 00:29:15,169
Well, Mr. Tucker,
while that sets up...

570
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:17,182
I'm going to see a man
about a wallaby.

571
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:20,917
Oh, Darla.

572
00:29:20,953 --> 00:29:22,818
What? What's wrong with her?

573
00:29:22,855 --> 00:29:25,551
She wouldn't stop
shaking the bag.

574
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:29,357
- Poor Chuckles.
- He was her present last year.

575
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:31,760
Hitched a ride
on the porcelain express.

576
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:35,827
She's a fish killer.

577
00:29:35,868 --> 00:29:38,132
I can't go with that girl.

578
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,933
I have to get back to my dad.

579
00:29:39,972 --> 00:29:43,874
Daddy! Help me!

580
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,069
Oh, he's stuck.

581
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,305
Nobody touch him.

582
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,549
Nobody touch him.

583
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:58,722
Can you help me?

584
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:00,724
No. You got yourself in there.

585
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:02,454
You can get yourself out.

586
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:04,758
- Gill...
- I want to see him do it.

587
00:30:04,797 --> 00:30:08,631
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

588
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:11,465
I can't. I have a bad fin.

589
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:13,664
Never stopped me.

590
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:20,303
Just think about
what you need to do.

591
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:25,807
Come on.

592
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:31,216
Perfect.

593
00:30:31,256 --> 00:30:32,621
- Yay!
- You did it!

594
00:30:32,658 --> 00:30:34,421
Good squirming.

595
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:38,054
From the ocean...
just like you, Gill.

596
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:39,256
Yeah.

597
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:41,664
I've seen that look before.

598
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,361
What are you thinking about?

599
00:30:43,402 --> 00:30:45,165
I'm thinking...

600
00:30:45,204 --> 00:30:48,765
tonight, we give the kid
a proper reception.

601
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:50,468
So, kid,
you got a name or what?

602
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:53,205
Nemo. I'm Nemo.

603
00:30:55,347 --> 00:30:57,815
Nemo. Nemo.

604
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:04,716
Are you gonna eat that?

605
00:31:16,268 --> 00:31:19,931
Careful with that hammer.

606
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:25,205
No, no.

607
00:31:25,244 --> 00:31:27,474
What does it say? Dory!

608
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,139
A sea monkey has my money.

609
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:31,445
Wake up. Get up. Come on.

610
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:32,450
Come on!

611
00:31:32,484 --> 00:31:34,714
- Yes, I'm a natural blue.
- Get up!

612
00:31:34,753 --> 00:31:37,984
Look out! Sharks eat fish!

613
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:02,137
Dusty.

614
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,704
The mask. Where's the mask?

615
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,284
No! No, not the mask!

616
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:09,844
Get it! Get the mask!
Get the mask! Get it!

617
00:32:14,026 --> 00:32:16,517
Hoo doot doo doot doot doo doot

618
00:32:17,996 --> 00:32:19,554
La la la la la la

619
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:21,327
it just keeps going on,
doesn't it?

620
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:23,766
Echo! Echo!

621
00:32:23,802 --> 00:32:25,030
Hey, what you doing?

622
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,332
It's gone. I've lost the mask.

623
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:28,396
- Did you drop it?
- You dropped it!

624
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,032
That was my only chance
of finding my son.

625
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:32,373
Now it's gone.

626
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,848
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills...

627
00:32:38,884 --> 00:32:40,476
when life gets you down,
know what you got to do?

628
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:42,953
- I don't want to know.
- Just keep swimming.

629
00:32:42,988 --> 00:32:46,424
Just keep swimming,
swimming, swimming

630
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:48,688
What do we do? We swim, swim

631
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:49,955
Dory, no singing.

632
00:32:49,995 --> 00:32:51,792
Ho ho ho ho ho ho

633
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,424
I love to swim

634
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:56,900
When you want to swim

635
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,926
See, I'm going to get
stuck now with that song.

636
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:03,207
- Now it's in my head.
- Sorry.

637
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,641
Dory, do you see anything?

638
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:06,405
- Something's got me.
- That was me. I'm sorry.

639
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:09,812
- Who's that?
- Who could it be? It's me.

640
00:33:09,848 --> 00:33:13,113
Are you my conscience?

641
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:15,779
Yeah, yeah.
I'm your conscience.

642
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:18,722
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?

643
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:21,021
- Can't complain.
- Yeah? Good.

644
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,788
Now, Dory,
I want you to tell me...

645
00:33:22,828 --> 00:33:24,557
Do you see anything?

646
00:33:24,596 --> 00:33:28,191
I see a... I see a light.

647
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:30,793
- A light?
- Yeah. Over there.

648
00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:34,294
- Hey, conscience, am I dead?
- No. I see it, too.

649
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,971
What is it?

650
00:33:44,016 --> 00:33:48,817
It's so pretty.

651
00:33:48,854 --> 00:33:53,655
I'm feeling... happy...

652
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:57,184
which is a big deal for me.

653
00:33:57,229 --> 00:33:58,719
I want to touch it.

654
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:02,732
Hey, come back.
Come on back here.

655
00:34:02,768 --> 00:34:04,326
I'm gonna get you

656
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:06,132
I'm gonna get you.

657
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:07,433
I'm gonna swim with you

658
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:08,837
I'm gonna get you.

659
00:34:08,874 --> 00:34:11,741
I'm gonna be your best friend

660
00:34:11,777 --> 00:34:12,937
Good feeling's gone.

661
00:34:19,785 --> 00:34:22,549
I can't see!
I don't know where I'm going!

662
00:34:24,456 --> 00:34:26,424
- The mask!
- What mask?

663
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:28,756
OK, I can't see a thing.

664
00:34:30,162 --> 00:34:32,460
- Oh, gee.
- Hey, look, a mask.

665
00:34:32,497 --> 00:34:34,158
Read it!

666
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,826
I'm sorry,
but if you could just...

667
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,802
bring it a little closer,
I kind of need the light.

668
00:34:37,836 --> 00:34:40,771
That's great.
Keep it right there.

669
00:34:40,806 --> 00:34:43,536
- Just read it!
- OK, OK.

670
00:34:43,575 --> 00:34:46,601
Mr. Bossy. "P."

671
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:49,614
OK. "P. Sher..."

672
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:52,742
"Sher... P. Sher..."
P. Shirley? P..."

673
00:34:54,653 --> 00:34:56,951
Oh. The first line's
"P. Sherman."

674
00:34:56,988 --> 00:34:59,183
"P. Sherman"
doesn't make any sense!

675
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,454
OK. Second line. "42."

676
00:35:01,493 --> 00:35:03,461
Don't eat me. Don't eat me.

677
00:35:05,197 --> 00:35:06,789
Light, please!

678
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:10,726
"Walla... walla..."

679
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:13,670
Waah! Waah! Waah!

680
00:35:13,705 --> 00:35:15,468
The second line's
"42 Wallaby Way."

681
00:35:15,507 --> 00:35:18,305
That's great.
Speed read. Take a guess.

682
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:19,970
No pressure. No problem.
There's a lot of pressure.

683
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:22,536
Pressure! Take a guess
now with pressure!

684
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:25,675
- "Sydney"! It's "Sydney"!
- Duck!

685
00:35:27,686 --> 00:35:31,087
I'm dead.
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

686
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:32,488
I died. I'm dead.

687
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:42,663
We did it, we did it

688
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:44,396
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

689
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,267
No eating here tonight, whoo!

690
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,669
Eating here tonight

691
00:35:47,706 --> 00:35:49,003
No, no, no, eating here tonight

692
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,507
- Dory.
- You on a diet

693
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:53,375
Dory! What did the mask say?

694
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:55,242
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

695
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,407
I remembered what it said!

696
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,940
I usually forget things,
but I remembered it!

697
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:01,646
Wait. Where is that?

698
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:04,120
I don't know.
But who cares? I remembered.

699
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:05,350
Raar!

700
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,620
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

701
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:09,684
I remembered it again!

702
00:36:36,388 --> 00:36:39,380
Nemo.

703
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:43,755
Nemo

704
00:36:43,795 --> 00:36:46,662
Suivez-moi.

705
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,392
Follow me.

706
00:37:36,314 --> 00:37:37,906
Hahoo wahoo yahoo ho

707
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:40,315
Hahoo wahoo yahoo ho

708
00:37:40,352 --> 00:37:42,445
Hahoo ho ho wahoo ha hee

709
00:37:42,487 --> 00:37:44,682
Ha ho wahee ha ho ho ho

710
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:45,917
Hoo!

711
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:49,655
State your name.

712
00:37:49,694 --> 00:37:51,787
Nemo.

713
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,162
Brother Bloat, proceed.

714
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,202
Nemo, newcomer
of orange and white...

715
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:00,602
you have been called forth...

716
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,199
to the summit of
Mount Wannahockaloogie...

717
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:08,543
to join with us in
the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

718
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,481
We want you in our club, kid.

719
00:38:11,516 --> 00:38:12,710
- Really?
- If...

720
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:16,016
you are able to swim through...

721
00:38:16,054 --> 00:38:20,514
the Ring of Fire!

722
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:25,860
Turn on the Ring of Fire!

723
00:38:25,897 --> 00:38:27,524
You said you could do it.

724
00:38:27,565 --> 00:38:29,157
The Ring of Fire!

725
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:33,663
Bubbles, let me... Oh!

726
00:38:33,705 --> 00:38:36,469
Ha hwa ha ho ho ho

727
00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:38,840
Ha hwa ha ho ho ho

728
00:38:38,877 --> 00:38:41,209
Ha hwa ha ho ho ho

729
00:38:41,246 --> 00:38:44,340
Isn't there another way?
He's just a boy!

730
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:59,823
From this moment on,
you will be known as Sharkbait.

731
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:01,195
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

732
00:39:01,232 --> 00:39:02,995
Welcome, Brother Sharkbait.

733
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:04,262
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

734
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:06,327
- Enough with the Sharkbait.
- Sharkbait!

735
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:08,236
Ba-ba-do.

736
00:39:08,273 --> 00:39:09,831
Sharkbait's
one of us now, agreed?

737
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:11,933
- Agreed.
- We can't send him to his death.

738
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:14,069
Darla's coming in five days.

739
00:39:14,112 --> 00:39:15,670
So, what are we going to do?

740
00:39:15,714 --> 00:39:18,274
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do...

741
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:19,874
we're gonna get him
out of here.

742
00:39:19,918 --> 00:39:22,443
- We'll help him escape.
- Escape? Really?

743
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:23,954
We're all gonna escape.

744
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:26,616
Gill, please.
Not another escape plan.

745
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:28,683
Sorry,
but they just never work.

746
00:39:28,727 --> 00:39:30,261
Why should this
be any different?

747
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:33,753
- Because we've got him.
- Me?

748
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:35,566
- You see that filter?
- Yeah.

749
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:39,003
You're the only one who can get
in and out of that thing.

750
00:39:39,037 --> 00:39:42,200
We need you to take
a pebble inside there...

751
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,468
and jam the gears.

752
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:45,476
You do that,
and this tank's gonna get...

753
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,478
filthier and filthier
by the minute.

754
00:39:47,512 --> 00:39:49,844
Pretty soon, the dentist'll
have to clean the tank...

755
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:52,782
and when he does, he'll take us
out of the tank...

756
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:54,375
put us in individual baggies...

757
00:39:54,419 --> 00:39:56,216
then we'll roll ourselves
down the counter...

758
00:39:56,254 --> 00:39:57,915
out the window,
off the awning...

759
00:39:57,956 --> 00:39:59,617
into the bushes,
across the street...

760
00:39:59,657 --> 00:40:02,125
and into the harbor!

761
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,095
It's foolproof. Who's with me?

762
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,529
- Aye!
- Aye!

763
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:07,997
I think you're nuts.

764
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:12,000
No offense, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

765
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:14,436
He's fine. He can do this.

766
00:40:14,472 --> 00:40:17,930
So, Sharkbait,
what do you think?

767
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:22,913
Let's do it.

768
00:40:22,914 --> 00:40:25,883
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

769
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:27,214
Where are you going?

770
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:28,913
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

771
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:30,580
If you ask where I'm going...

772
00:40:30,622 --> 00:40:32,351
I'll tell you
that's where I'm going.

773
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,857
It's P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

774
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:35,655
Where? I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you.

775
00:40:35,693 --> 00:40:37,251
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

776
00:40:37,295 --> 00:40:40,093
Excuse me.

777
00:40:40,131 --> 00:40:41,928
Hi. Do you know how to get...

778
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:44,935
Hello? Wait. Can you tell me...

779
00:40:44,969 --> 00:40:49,303
Hey! Hold it!
I'm trying to talk to you!

780
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,707
Fellas, come back here.
One quick question.

781
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:57,147
I need to...
And they're gone again.

782
00:40:57,182 --> 00:40:58,945
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

783
00:40:58,983 --> 00:41:00,644
Why do I have to tell you
over and over again?

784
00:41:00,685 --> 00:41:02,676
I'll tell you again.
I don't get tired of it...

785
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,880
OK, all right.

786
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:05,617
Here's the thing.

787
00:41:05,657 --> 00:41:11,152
I think it's best
if I carry on from here by...

788
00:41:11,196 --> 00:41:12,561
by myself.

789
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:13,791
OK.

790
00:41:13,832 --> 00:41:15,527
You know, alone.

791
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,592
Without... without...
I mean, not without you.

792
00:41:17,635 --> 00:41:21,002
But I don't
want you... with me.

793
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:23,371
Am I...

794
00:41:23,408 --> 00:41:24,568
I don't want to hurt
your feelings.

795
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:27,407
- You want me to leave?
- I mean, not... Yes.

796
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:29,879
I just can't afford
any more delays...

797
00:41:29,914 --> 00:41:33,111
and you're one of those fish
that cause delays.

798
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:34,778
Sometimes it's a good thing.

799
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:37,845
There's a whole group of fish.
They're delay fish.

800
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:39,447
You mean...

801
00:41:39,491 --> 00:41:41,152
You mean you don't like me?

802
00:41:41,192 --> 00:41:42,989
No, of course I like you.

803
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:45,723
It's because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

804
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:47,924
It's a complicated emotion.

805
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:51,663
Don't cry. I like you.

806
00:41:51,703 --> 00:41:56,072
Hey, you!
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

807
00:41:56,107 --> 00:41:58,041
I don't remember. Were you?

808
00:41:58,076 --> 00:41:59,976
No, no, no, no, no.
We're just...

809
00:42:00,011 --> 00:42:01,774
Do you guys know
how I can get to...

810
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:04,145
Look, pal, we're talking
to the lady, not you.

811
00:42:04,182 --> 00:42:05,774
Hey, hey. You like impressions?

812
00:42:07,886 --> 00:42:10,218
Just like in rehearsals,
gentlemen.

813
00:42:10,255 --> 00:42:11,813
So what are we? Take a guess.

814
00:42:11,856 --> 00:42:13,153
I've seen one of those.

815
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:15,386
I'm a fish with a nose
like a sword.

816
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:17,394
- Wait, wait...
- It's a swordfish!

817
00:42:17,428 --> 00:42:20,497
Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

818
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:22,056
Where's the butter?

819
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,499
It's on the tip of my tongue!

820
00:42:23,535 --> 00:42:25,526
- Lobster.
- Saw that!

821
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,401
Lots of legs!
Live in the ocean.

822
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:28,837
- Clam!
- Close enough!

823
00:42:28,873 --> 00:42:30,363
Oh, it's a whale of a tale

824
00:42:30,408 --> 00:42:31,875
I'll tell you, lad...

825
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:32,899
They're good.

826
00:42:32,944 --> 00:42:34,241
Will somebody please
give me directions?!

827
00:42:34,279 --> 00:42:36,645
"Will somebody please
give me directions?!"

828
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:38,706
I'm serious!

829
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,741
"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!"

830
00:42:40,785 --> 00:42:41,979
"Blah blah blah, me, me, me!"

831
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,510
Thank you.

832
00:42:43,555 --> 00:42:46,046
Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back!

833
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,726
- Hey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

834
00:42:48,793 --> 00:42:50,761
While they're doing their
silly little impressions...

835
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:54,925
I am miles from home with a fish
that can't remember her name!

836
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:56,263
I bet that's frustrating.

837
00:42:56,301 --> 00:42:57,734
Meanwhile, my son is out there.

838
00:42:57,769 --> 00:42:59,760
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo?

839
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:01,203
But it doesn't matter
because no fish...

840
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:03,207
in this entire ocean
is going to help me.

841
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:07,007
Well, I'm helping you.

842
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:08,376
Wait right here.

843
00:43:09,614 --> 00:43:12,208
- Guys!
- Is he bothering you again?

844
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,774
No, no. He's a good guy.

845
00:43:13,818 --> 00:43:16,019
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

846
00:43:16,087 --> 00:43:18,954
Any of you heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

847
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:21,685
Sydney? Oh, sure!

848
00:43:21,726 --> 00:43:23,455
Ted here's got relatives
in Sydney.

849
00:43:23,494 --> 00:43:25,121
- Don't you, Ted?
- Sure do!

850
00:43:25,163 --> 00:43:26,653
Oh! Hey! They know Sydney!

851
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:29,389
You wouldn't know how
to get there, would you?

852
00:43:29,434 --> 00:43:31,402
You want to follow the E.A.C.

853
00:43:31,436 --> 00:43:34,132
That's the East
Australian Current.

854
00:43:34,172 --> 00:43:35,799
Big current. Can't miss it.

855
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,809
It's in... that direction.

856
00:43:38,843 --> 00:43:40,743
And then you follow that
for about...

857
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:42,541
I don't know.
What do you guys think?

858
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,740
About three leagues?

859
00:43:43,781 --> 00:43:46,750
That little baby will put you
right past Sydney.

860
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:49,218
- Ta-da!
- That's great!

861
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:50,447
Dory, you did it!

862
00:43:50,488 --> 00:43:52,319
Oh, please,
I'm just your little helper.

863
00:43:52,357 --> 00:43:54,689
- Helping along. That's me.
- Fellas, thank you.

864
00:43:54,726 --> 00:43:58,355
Don't mention it!
Just loosen up, OK, buddy?

865
00:43:58,396 --> 00:44:01,388
Oh, you guys.
You really nailed him. Bye.

866
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:03,263
Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing.

867
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:06,862
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

868
00:44:06,904 --> 00:44:08,804
Trench...
through it, not over it.

869
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,536
I'll remember. Hey, hey!

870
00:44:12,977 --> 00:44:15,241
Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on!

871
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:18,009
Wait, wait, wait!
I gotta tell you something.

872
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:23,083
Nice trench.

873
00:44:24,822 --> 00:44:27,814
Hello!

874
00:44:30,528 --> 00:44:33,156
- OK, let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench.

875
00:44:33,197 --> 00:44:34,858
Come on, we'll swim over
this thing.

876
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:37,026
Partner.
Little red flag going up.

877
00:44:37,068 --> 00:44:40,697
Something's telling me
to swim through it, not over it.

878
00:44:40,738 --> 00:44:42,365
Are you looking at this thing?

879
00:44:42,407 --> 00:44:43,897
It's got death
written all over it.

880
00:44:43,941 --> 00:44:46,774
I really, really, really
think we should swim through.

881
00:44:46,811 --> 00:44:49,041
And I'm really, really done
talking about this. Over we go.

882
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,048
- Trust me on this.
- Trust you?

883
00:44:51,082 --> 00:44:52,947
Yes, trust.
It's what friends do.

884
00:44:52,984 --> 00:44:54,884
Look! Something shiny!

885
00:44:54,919 --> 00:44:56,682
- Where?
- It just swam over the trench.

886
00:44:56,721 --> 00:45:02,426
- Come on, we'll follow it!
- OK!

887
00:45:02,427 --> 00:45:05,089
Boy, it sure is clear up here.

888
00:45:05,129 --> 00:45:08,587
Exactly. And look at that...
there's the current.

889
00:45:08,633 --> 00:45:11,227
We should be there in no time.

890
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:13,066
Hey, little guy.

891
00:45:13,104 --> 00:45:14,867
You wanted to go
through the trench.

892
00:45:14,906 --> 00:45:16,931
I shall call him Squishy,
and he shall be mine.

893
00:45:16,974 --> 00:45:19,135
And he shall be my Squishy.
Come here, Squishy.

894
00:45:19,243 --> 00:45:20,676
Come here, little Squishy.

895
00:45:23,748 --> 00:45:26,615
- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy!

896
00:45:26,651 --> 00:45:28,448
Shoo, shoo! Get away!

897
00:45:28,486 --> 00:45:30,784
- Let me see that.
- Don't touch it.

898
00:45:30,822 --> 00:45:33,154
I won't touch it.
I just want to look.

899
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:35,216
Hey! How come
it didn't sting you?

900
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:36,783
It did. It's just that...

901
00:45:36,828 --> 00:45:38,523
Hold still.

902
00:45:38,563 --> 00:45:40,030
I live in this anemone...

903
00:45:40,064 --> 00:45:41,929
and I'm used
to these kind of stings.

904
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:45,158
It doesn't look bad.
You'll be fine.

905
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:46,932
But now we know, don't we...

906
00:45:46,971 --> 00:45:49,166
that we don't want
to touch these again.

907
00:45:49,207 --> 00:45:52,233
Let's be thankful this time
it was just a little one.

908
00:45:54,712 --> 00:45:55,974
Don't move.

909
00:45:57,815 --> 00:46:00,716
- This is bad, Dory.
- Hey, watch this!

910
00:46:00,752 --> 00:46:02,413
Boing! Boing!

911
00:46:02,453 --> 00:46:03,681
Dory!

912
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:06,053
You can't catch me

913
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,557
Don't bounce on the tops!

914
00:46:07,592 --> 00:46:10,720
They will... not sting you!

915
00:46:10,762 --> 00:46:13,424
- The tops don't sting you!
- Two in a row! Beat that!

916
00:46:13,464 --> 00:46:16,399
Dory, listen to me.
I have an idea... a game.

917
00:46:16,434 --> 00:46:17,901
- A game?
- Yes.

918
00:46:18,002 --> 00:46:20,664
- I love games! Pick me!
- Here's the game.

919
00:46:20,705 --> 00:46:24,163
Whoever can hop the fastest
out of these jellyfish wins!

920
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:25,835
- OK.
- Rules, rules, rules!

921
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:28,437
You can't touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.

922
00:46:28,479 --> 00:46:30,344
Something about tentacles.
Got it. Go!

923
00:46:30,381 --> 00:46:33,316
Wait! Not something about 'em,
it's all about 'em!

924
00:46:33,351 --> 00:46:34,545
- Whee!
- Wait, Dory!

925
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:36,686
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

926
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:37,881
Dory!

927
00:46:37,922 --> 00:46:39,890
Boing, boing, boing!

928
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:42,791
Wait a minute! Dory!

929
00:46:42,827 --> 00:46:44,351
Whee!

930
00:46:44,395 --> 00:46:47,660
We're cheating death now.
That's what we're doing.

931
00:46:47,698 --> 00:46:49,359
But we're having fun
at the same time.

932
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,833
I can do this. Just be careful.

933
00:46:50,868 --> 00:46:52,768
Yeah, careful I don't
make you cry when I win!

934
00:46:52,804 --> 00:46:53,964
I don't think so!

935
00:46:57,408 --> 00:46:58,568
Give it up, old man.

936
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:00,873
You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

937
00:47:00,912 --> 00:47:02,880
The question is, Dory,
are you hungry?

938
00:47:02,914 --> 00:47:04,245
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

939
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:07,012
'Cause you're about
to eat my bubbles!

940
00:47:07,051 --> 00:47:09,212
Duck to the left! Right there!

941
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:14,023
The clownfish is the winner!

942
00:47:14,058 --> 00:47:17,118
We did it! Look at us!

943
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:18,688
Dory?

944
00:47:20,923 --> 00:47:22,322
Oh, no.

945
00:47:23,392 --> 00:47:25,690
Dory! Dory!

946
00:47:25,728 --> 00:47:27,821
Dory!

947
00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:32,029
Dory!

948
00:47:36,205 --> 00:47:38,935
Am I disqualified?

949
00:47:38,974 --> 00:47:40,942
No, you're doing fine!
You're actually winning!

950
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:44,104
But you gotta stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

951
00:47:44,146 --> 00:47:47,047
P. Sherman...
Wallaby Way, Sydney...

952
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:48,846
That's it!

953
00:47:50,086 --> 00:47:52,782
- Wallaby Way...
- Stay awake!

954
00:47:52,822 --> 00:47:55,120
Stay awake! Stay awake!

955
00:47:55,157 --> 00:47:58,923
Stay... awake!

956
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:04,729
- Awake.
- P. Sherman.

957
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:07,759
- Awake.
- 42 Wallaby Way.

958
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:11,773
Wake up. Nemo...

959
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:28,855
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

960
00:48:28,891 --> 00:48:30,259
Yeah.

961
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:34,285
You're lucky to have someone
out there looking for you.

962
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,491
He's not looking for me.

963
00:48:36,532 --> 00:48:39,899
He's scared of the ocean.

964
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,493
Peach, any movement?

965
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:44,471
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's gotta be soon.

966
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:46,031
Keep on him.

967
00:48:48,444 --> 00:48:51,277
My first escape...
landed on dental tools.

968
00:48:51,313 --> 00:48:52,746
I was aiming for the toilet.

969
00:48:52,782 --> 00:48:53,976
Toilet?

970
00:48:54,016 --> 00:48:56,610
All drains
lead to the ocean, kid.

971
00:48:56,652 --> 00:48:59,917
How many times have
you tried to get out?

972
00:48:59,955 --> 00:49:01,547
I've lost count.

973
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,524
Fish aren't meant
to be in a box, kid.

974
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:05,220
It does things to you.

975
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:07,388
Bubbles! Bubbles!

976
00:49:07,429 --> 00:49:09,795
Potty break! He grabbed
the "Reader's Digest."

977
00:49:09,832 --> 00:49:13,233
- We have 4.2 minutes!
- That's your cue, Sharkbait.

978
00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:15,567
- You can do it, kid.
- We gotta be quick.

979
00:49:15,805 --> 00:49:18,239
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

980
00:49:18,274 --> 00:49:20,037
and I'll talk you
through the rest.

981
00:49:20,075 --> 00:49:22,873
- OK.
- It'll be a piece of kelp.

982
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,685
Nicely done!

983
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:34,450
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!

984
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,981
Here comes the pebble.

985
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,454
Ptoo.

986
00:49:41,931 --> 00:49:44,729
Now, do you see
a small opening?

987
00:49:46,235 --> 00:49:49,398
Inside it,
you'll see a rotating fan.

988
00:49:49,438 --> 00:49:53,966
Wedge that pebble into the fan
to stop it turning.

989
00:49:58,714 --> 00:50:01,012
- Careful, Sharkbait!
- I can't do it!

990
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:02,574
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

991
00:50:02,618 --> 00:50:04,381
He'll be fine. Try again!

992
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,116
OK.

993
00:50:07,156 --> 00:50:09,624
That's it, Sharkbait.

994
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:11,956
Nice and steady.

995
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,988
I got it! I got it!

996
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:18,761
- He did it!
- That's great, kid!

997
00:50:18,801 --> 00:50:20,996
Now swim up the tube and out.

998
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:41,017
Oh, no! Gill!

999
00:50:41,056 --> 00:50:42,250
- Sharkbait!
- Oh, my gosh!

1000
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:43,519
Get him outta there!

1001
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:46,084
- What do we do?
- Oh, no!

1002
00:50:46,128 --> 00:50:48,096
Stay calm, kid.
Just don't panic!

1003
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:50,530
Help me!

1004
00:50:50,566 --> 00:50:52,932
Sharkbait, grab hold of this!

1005
00:50:56,438 --> 00:50:58,406
- No! No! No!
- Feed me more!

1006
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,375
- That's it!
- Sharkbait! Grab it!

1007
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:04,106
I got it!

1008
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:05,943
Pull!

1009
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:15,317
Gill, don't make him
go back in there.

1010
00:51:16,558 --> 00:51:20,585
No. We're done.

1011
00:51:33,642 --> 00:51:35,337
Dude.

1012
00:51:35,377 --> 00:51:38,437
Dude.

1013
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,974
Focus, dude. Dude.

1014
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:46,279
Oh, he lives. Hey, dude!

1015
00:51:46,322 --> 00:51:49,689
What happened?

1016
00:51:49,725 --> 00:51:51,784
Saw the whole thing, dude.

1017
00:51:51,827 --> 00:51:53,692
First, you were all,
like, "Whoa!"...

1018
00:51:53,729 --> 00:51:55,356
and then we were
all, like, "Whoa!"...

1019
00:51:55,397 --> 00:51:57,297
and then you were,
like, "Whoa."

1020
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:58,766
What are you talking about?

1021
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:02,237
You, mini-man.
Takin' on the jellies.

1022
00:52:02,271 --> 00:52:05,104
You got serious
thrill issues, dude.

1023
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,402
Awesome.

1024
00:52:06,442 --> 00:52:09,639
Oh, my stomach.

1025
00:52:09,678 --> 00:52:11,646
Oh, man. No hurlin'
on the shell, dude, OK?

1026
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,874
Just waxed it.

1027
00:52:12,915 --> 00:52:15,145
So, Mr. Turtle...

1028
00:52:15,184 --> 00:52:17,550
Dude. Mr. Turtle is my father.

1029
00:52:17,586 --> 00:52:19,019
The name's Crush.

1030
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:21,386
Crush? Really?

1031
00:52:21,423 --> 00:52:26,087
OK, Crush. I need to
the East Australian Current.

1032
00:52:26,128 --> 00:52:27,356
E.A.C.?

1033
00:52:27,396 --> 00:52:29,330
Oh, dude.

1034
00:52:29,365 --> 00:52:31,731
You're ridin' it, dude!

1035
00:52:31,767 --> 00:52:34,395
Check it out!

1036
00:52:55,324 --> 00:52:57,189
OK, grab shell, dude!

1037
00:52:57,226 --> 00:52:59,594
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

1038
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:11,032
Righteous! Righteous!

1039
00:53:11,073 --> 00:53:15,810
- Yeah!
- Stop!

1040
00:53:15,811 --> 00:53:18,279
So...

1041
00:53:18,313 --> 00:53:21,840
What brings you on this fine day
to the E.A.C.?

1042
00:53:21,884 --> 00:53:24,478
Dory and I need
to get to Sydney.

1043
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,750
Dory! Is she all right?

1044
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:28,586
Oh, little blue.

1045
00:53:29,691 --> 00:53:31,283
She is sub-level, dude.

1046
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:37,991
Dory! Dory! Dory!

1047
00:53:38,033 --> 00:53:39,762
Dory.

1048
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:44,336
I'm so sorry.

1049
00:53:44,373 --> 00:53:47,706
This is all my fault.
It's my fault.

1050
00:53:47,743 --> 00:53:52,713
Twenty-nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here I come!

1051
00:53:52,714 --> 00:53:54,739
There you are!

1052
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:01,287
Dory?

1053
00:54:01,323 --> 00:54:03,154
Nice wave!

1054
00:54:06,962 --> 00:54:08,796
Up you go!

1055
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:21,435
- Oh, my goodness!
- Kill the motor, dude.

1056
00:54:21,477 --> 00:54:24,810
Let us see what Squirt does
flying solo.

1057
00:54:33,288 --> 00:54:36,280
That was so cool!

1058
00:54:36,325 --> 00:54:38,122
Hey, Dad, did you see that?

1059
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,492
Did you see me?
Did you see what I did?

1060
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:43,498
You so totally rock, Squirt!

1061
00:54:43,532 --> 00:54:45,056
So give me some fin.

1062
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,499
Noggin.

1063
00:54:46,535 --> 00:54:47,900
- Dude.
- Dude.

1064
00:54:47,936 --> 00:54:49,335
Oh... intro.

1065
00:54:49,371 --> 00:54:51,271
Jellyman, offspring.

1066
00:54:51,306 --> 00:54:53,365
Offspring, Jellyman.

1067
00:54:53,408 --> 00:54:56,935
- Jellies?! Sweet.
- Totally.

1068
00:54:56,979 --> 00:55:00,210
Apparently, I must've done
something you liked... dudes.

1069
00:55:00,249 --> 00:55:02,683
You rock, dude!

1070
00:55:02,718 --> 00:55:07,451
Curl away, my son.
It's awesome, Jellyman.

1071
00:55:07,489 --> 00:55:09,150
The little dudes are just eggs.

1072
00:55:09,191 --> 00:55:10,954
We leave 'em
on a beach to hatch...

1073
00:55:10,993 --> 00:55:12,255
and then, coo-coo-cachoo...

1074
00:55:12,294 --> 00:55:14,694
they find their way back
to the big ol' blue.

1075
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,062
- All by themselves?
- Yeah.

1076
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:20,091
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

1077
00:55:20,135 --> 00:55:21,363
Well, you never really know.

1078
00:55:21,403 --> 00:55:24,804
But when they know,
you'll know, you know? Ha.

1079
00:55:29,044 --> 00:55:30,477
Hey, look, everybody.

1080
00:55:30,512 --> 00:55:33,208
I know that dude!
It's the Jellyman!

1081
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:35,273
Go on. Jump on him!

1082
00:55:35,317 --> 00:55:38,514
- Turtle pile!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1083
00:55:38,554 --> 00:55:40,613
- Are you funny?
- Where's your shell?

1084
00:55:40,656 --> 00:55:42,715
- I need to breathe!
- Are you running away?

1085
00:55:42,758 --> 00:55:44,419
Did you really cross
the jellyfish forest?

1086
00:55:44,459 --> 00:55:46,427
- Did they sting you?
- One at a time!

1087
00:55:46,461 --> 00:55:48,122
Mr. Fish, did you die?

1088
00:55:48,163 --> 00:55:50,688
Sorry, I was
a little vague on the details.

1089
00:55:50,732 --> 00:55:51,892
So, where are you going?

1090
00:55:51,934 --> 00:55:53,799
You see, my son was taken.

1091
00:55:53,835 --> 00:55:56,668
My son was taken away from me.

1092
00:55:56,705 --> 00:55:58,969
- No way.
- What happened?

1093
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:01,168
No, no, kids.
I don't want to talk about it.

1094
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:03,542
Aww! Please?

1095
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:04,910
Please?

1096
00:56:04,947 --> 00:56:07,682
Well, OK.

1097
00:56:07,683 --> 00:56:11,517
I live on this reef
a long, long way from here.

1098
00:56:11,553 --> 00:56:13,578
This is gonna be good.
I can tell.

1099
00:56:13,622 --> 00:56:16,022
And my son Nemo...

1100
00:56:16,058 --> 00:56:18,026
See, he was mad at me.

1101
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,687
And maybe he wouldn't
have done it...

1102
00:56:19,728 --> 00:56:21,218
if I hadn't been
so tough on him.

1103
00:56:21,263 --> 00:56:22,491
I don't know.

1104
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:24,522
Anyway, he swam out in
the open water to this boat...

1105
00:56:24,566 --> 00:56:27,433
and when he was out there,
these divers appeared...

1106
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:30,097
and I tried to stop them,
but the boat was too fast.

1107
00:56:30,138 --> 00:56:31,901
So, we swam out in the ocean
to follow them...

1108
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,272
They couldn't stop 'em.
And then Nemo's dad...

1109
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:37,073
he swims out to the ocean,
and they bump into...

1110
00:56:37,112 --> 00:56:38,409
three ferocious sharks.

1111
00:56:38,447 --> 00:56:40,540
He scares away the sharks
by blowing 'em up!

1112
00:56:40,582 --> 00:56:41,913
Golly, that's amazing.

1113
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,577
And then dives
thousands of feet...

1114
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:45,348
straight down into the dark.

1115
00:56:45,387 --> 00:56:46,854
It's wicked dark down there.

1116
00:56:46,888 --> 00:56:48,583
You can't see a thing.
How's it going, Bob?

1117
00:56:48,624 --> 00:56:50,285
And the only thing
they can see down there...

1118
00:56:50,325 --> 00:56:52,054
is the light from
this big, horrible creature...

1119
00:56:52,094 --> 00:56:54,062
with razor-sharp teeth.
Nice parry, old man.

1120
00:56:54,096 --> 00:56:55,461
And then he has
to blast his way...

1121
00:56:55,497 --> 00:56:57,124
So, these two little fish
have been...

1122
00:56:57,165 --> 00:57:00,701
searching the ocean for days
on the East Australian Current.

1123
00:57:00,702 --> 00:57:03,034
Which means that he may be
on his way here right now.

1124
00:57:03,071 --> 00:57:04,595
That should put him
in Sydney Harbor...

1125
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,937
In a matter of days.
I mean, it sounds like...

1126
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:07,965
this guy is gonna
stop at nothing...

1127
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:10,774
till he finds his son.
I sure hope he makes it.

1128
00:57:10,812 --> 00:57:13,804
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

1129
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:21,355
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1130
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:26,692
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1131
00:57:26,728 --> 00:57:28,423
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1132
00:57:28,463 --> 00:57:31,864
Would you just shut up?!

1133
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,367
You're rats with wings!

1134
00:57:33,402 --> 00:57:34,892
Bloke's been looking
for his boy Nemo.

1135
00:57:34,936 --> 00:57:37,268
- Nemo?!
- He was taken off the reef...

1136
00:57:37,306 --> 00:57:40,332
- Take it! You happy?
- Mine! Mine! Mine!

1137
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:43,173
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.

1138
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:44,371
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1139
00:57:44,413 --> 00:57:45,903
Whoooa...

1140
00:57:47,149 --> 00:57:48,707
Mine?

1141
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,980
Last I heard, he's heading
towards the harbor.

1142
00:57:51,019 --> 00:57:53,453
Brilliant!

1143
00:58:06,335 --> 00:58:08,336
Is he doing OK?

1144
00:58:08,403 --> 00:58:11,600
Whatever you do,
Don't mention D-a-r...

1145
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,507
It's OK. I know who
you're talking about.

1146
00:58:22,517 --> 00:58:23,848
Gill?

1147
00:58:26,321 --> 00:58:28,050
Gill?

1148
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:30,752
Hey, Sharkbait.

1149
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:33,022
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the...

1150
00:58:33,061 --> 00:58:35,222
No, I'm the one
who should be sorry.

1151
00:58:35,263 --> 00:58:37,891
I was so ready to get out...

1152
00:58:37,933 --> 00:58:40,697
so ready to taste that ocean...

1153
00:58:40,736 --> 00:58:44,172
I was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

1154
00:58:44,206 --> 00:58:48,165
Nothing should be worth that.

1155
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:51,441
I'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

1156
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:58,051
All right. Hey, hey, hey...

1157
00:58:58,086 --> 00:58:59,713
What the...

1158
00:58:59,755 --> 00:59:03,486
That's one way to pull a tooth.

1159
00:59:03,525 --> 00:59:05,618
Darn kids.

1160
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:08,652
Good thing I pulled the
right one, eh, Prime Minister?

1161
00:59:08,697 --> 00:59:10,255
Hey.

1162
00:59:10,298 --> 00:59:12,289
Oh, Nigel!
You just missed an extraction.

1163
00:59:12,334 --> 00:59:14,962
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

1164
00:59:15,003 --> 00:59:17,062
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

1165
00:59:17,172 --> 00:59:19,436
- I've got to speak with him.
- What is it?

1166
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:21,567
Your dad's been fighting
the entire ocean...

1167
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,238
- looking for you.
- My father? Really?

1168
00:59:24,279 --> 00:59:28,409
He's traveled hundreds of miles,
battling sharks and jellyfish...

1169
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:30,941
Sharks? That can't be him.

1170
00:59:30,986 --> 00:59:33,580
What was his name?
Some sort of sport fish.

1171
00:59:33,622 --> 00:59:35,783
- Tuna? Trout?
- Marlin?

1172
00:59:35,824 --> 00:59:37,655
Marlin! The little clownfish
from the reef.

1173
00:59:37,692 --> 00:59:40,286
It's my dad!
He took on a shark!

1174
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:42,660
I heard he took on three.

1175
00:59:42,697 --> 00:59:45,530
- Three sharks?
- That's 4,800 teeth!

1176
00:59:45,567 --> 00:59:47,660
After you were taken
by Diver Dan over there...

1177
00:59:47,702 --> 00:59:49,932
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

1178
00:59:49,971 --> 00:59:51,336
Really?

1179
00:59:51,373 --> 00:59:53,170
He's swimming,
giving it all he's got...

1180
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:55,267
and then three gigantic
sharks capture him...

1181
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:57,574
and he blows them up
and dives thousands of feet...

1182
00:59:57,612 --> 01:00:00,445
and gets chased by a monster
with huge teeth!

1183
01:00:00,482 --> 01:00:03,110
He ties this demon to a rock,
and what's his reward?

1184
01:00:03,151 --> 01:00:05,517
He gets to battle
an entire jellyfish forest!

1185
01:00:05,554 --> 01:00:08,751
Now he's with a bunch of
sea turtles on the E.A. C...

1186
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:12,282
and the word is he's headed
this way right now... to Sydney!

1187
01:00:12,327 --> 01:00:13,692
What a good daddy!

1188
01:00:13,728 --> 01:00:16,288
He was looking for you
after all, Sharkbait.

1189
01:00:19,801 --> 01:00:21,428
He's swimming to the filter!

1190
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:22,960
- Sharkbait!
- Not again!

1191
01:00:24,506 --> 01:00:27,441
Sharkbait!

1192
01:00:27,476 --> 01:00:28,841
No!

1193
01:00:28,877 --> 01:00:30,071
You got your whole life
ahead of you!

1194
01:00:30,111 --> 01:00:32,511
- We'll help you, kid!
- Get him out!

1195
01:00:36,818 --> 01:00:38,479
Get him out of there!

1196
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,147
Come on, kid! Grab the end!

1197
01:00:40,188 --> 01:00:42,782
Sharkbait!

1198
01:00:42,824 --> 01:00:44,849
- No!
- Can you hear me?

1199
01:00:44,893 --> 01:00:46,383
Nemo! Can you hear me?

1200
01:00:46,428 --> 01:00:48,453
Yeah, I can hear you.

1201
01:00:48,497 --> 01:00:50,431
Sharkbait, you did it!

1202
01:00:50,465 --> 01:00:54,265
Sharkbait, you're...
covered with germs!

1203
01:00:54,302 --> 01:00:56,370
That took guts, kid.

1204
01:00:56,371 --> 01:00:58,862
All right, gang,
we have less than 48 hours...

1205
01:00:58,907 --> 01:01:00,204
before Darla gets here.

1206
01:01:00,242 --> 01:01:01,937
This tank'll get
plenty dirty in that time...

1207
01:01:01,977 --> 01:01:04,810
but we have to help it along
any way we can.

1208
01:01:04,846 --> 01:01:07,110
- Jacques? No cleaning.
- I shall resist.

1209
01:01:07,148 --> 01:01:09,810
Everybody else,
be as gross as possible.

1210
01:01:09,851 --> 01:01:11,079
Think dirty thoughts.

1211
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,314
We're gonna make
this tank so filthy...

1212
01:01:13,355 --> 01:01:15,880
the dentist
will have to clean it.

1213
01:01:15,924 --> 01:01:18,017
Good work!

1214
01:01:24,566 --> 01:01:27,091
All right, we're here, dudes!

1215
01:01:27,135 --> 01:01:30,332
Get ready!
Your exit's coming up, man!

1216
01:01:30,372 --> 01:01:31,862
Where? I don't see it!

1217
01:01:31,907 --> 01:01:34,341
Right there!
I see it! I see it!

1218
01:01:34,376 --> 01:01:37,504
The swirling vortex of terror?

1219
01:01:37,546 --> 01:01:39,844
- That's it, dude.
- Of course it is.

1220
01:01:39,881 --> 01:01:43,908
OK, first,
find your exit buddy.

1221
01:01:43,952 --> 01:01:46,443
Do you have your exit buddy?

1222
01:01:46,488 --> 01:01:47,716
Yes!

1223
01:01:47,756 --> 01:01:52,489
Squirt give you a rundown
of proper exiting technique.

1224
01:01:52,527 --> 01:01:56,054
Good afternoon!
We'll have a great jump today!

1225
01:01:56,097 --> 01:01:59,794
OK, crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

1226
01:01:59,834 --> 01:02:02,769
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out!

1227
01:02:02,804 --> 01:02:06,069
Remember...
rip it, roll it, and punch it!

1228
01:02:06,107 --> 01:02:09,235
He's trying to speak to me,
I know it!

1229
01:02:09,277 --> 01:02:12,508
You're really cute, but I don't
know what you're saying!

1230
01:02:12,547 --> 01:02:13,809
Say the first thing again.

1231
01:02:13,848 --> 01:02:16,373
OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!

1232
01:02:30,732 --> 01:02:33,326
That was... fun!

1233
01:02:33,368 --> 01:02:35,632
I actually enjoyed that.

1234
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,297
Hey, look, turtles!

1235
01:02:37,339 --> 01:02:40,274
Most excellent!

1236
01:02:40,308 --> 01:02:42,071
Now turn your
fishy tails around...

1237
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:45,307
and swim straight on
through to Sydney!

1238
01:02:45,347 --> 01:02:47,508
No worries, man!

1239
01:02:47,549 --> 01:02:49,608
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!

1240
01:02:49,651 --> 01:02:52,211
- Bye!
- Bye, Jellyman!

1241
01:02:52,253 --> 01:02:54,551
You tell your little dude
I said hi, OK?

1242
01:02:54,589 --> 01:02:55,749
See ya later, dudes!

1243
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:57,519
Bye, everyone!

1244
01:02:57,559 --> 01:02:59,891
Nemo would have loved this.

1245
01:02:59,928 --> 01:03:03,261
Hey! Crush, I forgot!

1246
01:03:03,298 --> 01:03:04,856
How old are you?

1247
01:03:04,899 --> 01:03:09,097
150, dude!
And still young! Rock on!

1248
01:03:09,137 --> 01:03:13,164
150! 150!
I gotta remember that.

1249
01:03:19,214 --> 01:03:21,842
- We going in there?
- Yep.

1250
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:23,942
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1251
01:03:23,985 --> 01:03:29,617
Yep. We're gonna
just swim straight.

1252
01:03:29,658 --> 01:03:32,422
Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming

1253
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,620
Dory...

1254
01:03:42,404 --> 01:03:45,032
Boy, this is taking awhile.

1255
01:03:45,073 --> 01:03:46,768
How about we play a game?

1256
01:03:46,808 --> 01:03:48,070
OK.

1257
01:03:48,109 --> 01:03:51,169
OK, I'm thinking
of something orange...

1258
01:03:51,212 --> 01:03:52,702
and it's small...

1259
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:55,045
- It's me.
- Right!

1260
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:58,644
It's orange and small...

1261
01:03:58,687 --> 01:03:59,984
It's me.

1262
01:04:00,021 --> 01:04:01,921
All righty, Mr. Smartypants.

1263
01:04:01,956 --> 01:04:05,124
And it's orange and small
and white stripes...

1264
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,390
Me. And the next one,
just a guess, me.

1265
01:04:07,429 --> 01:04:09,954
- That's just scary.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1266
01:04:09,998 --> 01:04:11,829
I have definitely seen
this floating speck before.

1267
01:04:11,866 --> 01:04:13,390
That means
we've passed it before...

1268
01:04:13,435 --> 01:04:14,800
and that means
we're going in circles...

1269
01:04:14,836 --> 01:04:16,394
and that means
we're not going straight!

1270
01:04:16,504 --> 01:04:18,597
- Hey, hey!
- Get to the surface.

1271
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,232
We'll figure it out
up there. Let's go!

1272
01:04:20,275 --> 01:04:22,470
- Hey! Relax.
- What?

1273
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:25,104
Take a deep breath.

1274
01:04:27,048 --> 01:04:29,349
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1275
01:04:29,384 --> 01:04:31,409
Fine. Who do you
want to ask, the speck?

1276
01:04:31,453 --> 01:04:33,819
- There's nobody here!
- There has to be someone.

1277
01:04:33,855 --> 01:04:36,722
It's the ocean, silly.
We're not the only two in here.

1278
01:04:36,758 --> 01:04:39,090
Let's see. OK, no one there.

1279
01:04:39,127 --> 01:04:43,587
Nope. Nada.

1280
01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:46,796
There's somebody.
Hey! Excuse...

1281
01:04:46,835 --> 01:04:48,666
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it's my turn.

1282
01:04:48,703 --> 01:04:50,295
I'm thinking of something
dark and mysterious.

1283
01:04:50,338 --> 01:04:52,704
It's a fish we don't know.
If we ask it directions...

1284
01:04:52,741 --> 01:04:54,766
it could ingest us
and spit out our bones!

1285
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:57,277
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

1286
01:04:57,312 --> 01:04:59,109
I don't want to play
the gender card right now.

1287
01:04:59,147 --> 01:05:01,081
Let's play
the "Let's Not Die" card.

1288
01:05:01,116 --> 01:05:03,016
- You want to get out of here?
- Of course I do.

1289
01:05:03,051 --> 01:05:06,316
How are we gonna do that
unless we give it a shot?

1290
01:05:06,354 --> 01:05:08,345
Dory, you don't
fully understand...

1291
01:05:08,389 --> 01:05:10,380
Come on. Trust me on this.

1292
01:05:18,466 --> 01:05:22,302
All right.

1293
01:05:22,303 --> 01:05:25,568
Excuse me! Little fella?

1294
01:05:25,607 --> 01:05:29,543
Hello! Don't be rude. Say Hi.

1295
01:05:29,577 --> 01:05:31,602
Ha. Hello.

1296
01:05:31,646 --> 01:05:33,170
- His son Bingo...
- Nemo.

1297
01:05:33,214 --> 01:05:36,240
- Nemo was taken to...
- Sydney.

1298
01:05:36,284 --> 01:05:39,481
Sydney! And it's
really, really important...

1299
01:05:39,521 --> 01:05:41,455
that we get there
as fast as we can...

1300
01:05:41,489 --> 01:05:43,582
so can you help us out?

1301
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:47,152
Come on, little fella. Come on.

1302
01:05:47,195 --> 01:05:50,426
Dory, I'm a little fella.

1303
01:05:50,465 --> 01:05:53,967
I don't think
that's a little fella.

1304
01:05:53,968 --> 01:05:57,870
Oh! Big fella. Whale. OK.

1305
01:05:57,906 --> 01:06:00,374
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1306
01:06:00,408 --> 01:06:03,639
Mooo! Weee neeed...

1307
01:06:03,678 --> 01:06:07,774
- Dory?
- Tooo fiind his son.

1308
01:06:07,816 --> 01:06:10,478
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

1309
01:06:10,518 --> 01:06:13,886
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1310
01:06:13,955 --> 01:06:16,287
Dory! Heaven knows
what you're saying!

1311
01:06:16,324 --> 01:06:19,919
- See, he's swimming away.
- Cooome baaack.

1312
01:06:19,961 --> 01:06:22,225
He's not coming back.
You offended him.

1313
01:06:22,263 --> 01:06:23,457
Maybe a different dialect.

1314
01:06:23,498 --> 01:06:26,695
Dory!

1315
01:06:26,734 --> 01:06:29,999
This is not whale.
You're speaking upset stomach.

1316
01:06:30,038 --> 01:06:32,238
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don't.

1317
01:06:33,775 --> 01:06:36,744
- You actually sound sick.
- Maybe louder?

1318
01:06:36,778 --> 01:06:38,245
- Rah! Rah!
- Don't do that!

1319
01:06:38,279 --> 01:06:40,008
Too much orca.
Didn't it sound orca-ish?

1320
01:06:40,048 --> 01:06:41,379
It doesn't sound orca.

1321
01:06:41,416 --> 01:06:43,213
It sounds like nothing
I've ever heard.

1322
01:06:45,787 --> 01:06:47,654
It's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1323
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:50,747
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

1324
01:06:50,792 --> 01:06:54,319
- Swim away!
- Oh, look, krill!

1325
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:59,200
Move, Dory, move!

1326
01:07:05,306 --> 01:07:08,070
Look at that.
Would you look at that?

1327
01:07:08,109 --> 01:07:12,068
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1328
01:07:12,113 --> 01:07:15,105
All thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

1329
01:07:15,149 --> 01:07:17,174
Jacques, I said no cleaning.

1330
01:07:17,285 --> 01:07:19,048
I am ashamed.

1331
01:07:19,087 --> 01:07:21,555
Look! Scum angel!

1332
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,694
Bubbles! I love the bubbles!

1333
01:07:29,764 --> 01:07:33,393
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?

1334
01:07:33,434 --> 01:07:36,062
9:00 and cue dentist.

1335
01:07:36,104 --> 01:07:38,368
Hello, Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

1336
01:07:38,406 --> 01:07:41,102
OK, here we go. Here we go, OK.

1337
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:42,871
Little Davey Reynolds...

1338
01:07:42,911 --> 01:07:44,503
Walks to the counter,
drops the keys...

1339
01:07:44,545 --> 01:07:46,638
Bloat, that's disgusting!

1340
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:48,706
Tastes pretty good to me.

1341
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,513
- Urrrp!
- Eww!

1342
01:07:50,551 --> 01:07:53,418
Don't you people realize
we are swimming in our own...

1343
01:07:53,454 --> 01:07:54,546
Here he comes!

1344
01:07:56,591 --> 01:07:59,890
Crikey. What a state.

1345
01:08:01,362 --> 01:08:05,492
Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

1346
01:08:05,533 --> 01:08:08,468
- 10:00, luv.
- Leave it open, would you?

1347
01:08:08,503 --> 01:08:10,835
I've gotta clean the fish tank
before Darla gets here.

1348
01:08:10,872 --> 01:08:12,965
Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

1349
01:08:13,007 --> 01:08:16,704
Yay! He's gonna clean the tank!

1350
01:08:16,744 --> 01:08:18,507
We're gonna be clean!

1351
01:08:18,546 --> 01:08:20,207
You ready to see your dad, kid?

1352
01:08:20,248 --> 01:08:22,182
Of course you are.

1353
01:08:22,216 --> 01:08:24,844
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's out there...

1354
01:08:24,886 --> 01:08:28,053
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1355
01:08:28,156 --> 01:08:30,522
Yeah.

1356
01:09:45,526 --> 01:09:47,255
Here comes the big one.

1357
01:09:47,294 --> 01:09:49,819
Come on! You gotta try this!

1358
01:09:49,864 --> 01:09:53,129
- Will you just stop it?
- Why? What's wrong?

1359
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:55,465
We're in a whale,
don't you get it?

1360
01:09:55,503 --> 01:09:56,663
- Whale?
- A whale!

1361
01:09:56,704 --> 01:09:59,434
You had to ask for help!
And now we're stuck here!

1362
01:09:59,473 --> 01:10:02,237
A whale. I speak whale.

1363
01:10:02,276 --> 01:10:04,608
No, you're insane!
You can't speak whale!

1364
01:10:04,645 --> 01:10:07,842
I have to get out!
I have to find my son!

1365
01:10:07,882 --> 01:10:13,286
I have to tell him
how old sea turtles are!

1366
01:10:24,298 --> 01:10:27,131
Hey...

1367
01:10:27,168 --> 01:10:29,432
you OK?

1368
01:10:35,509 --> 01:10:38,501
There, there. It's all right.

1369
01:10:38,546 --> 01:10:40,480
It'll be OK.

1370
01:10:40,514 --> 01:10:42,744
No. No, it won't.

1371
01:10:42,783 --> 01:10:45,013
Sure it will. You'll see.

1372
01:10:45,052 --> 01:10:51,184
No. I promised him I'd never
let anything happen to him.

1373
01:10:51,225 --> 01:10:54,626
That's a funny thing
to promise.

1374
01:10:54,662 --> 01:10:56,027
What?

1375
01:10:56,063 --> 01:10:58,497
You can't never let
anything happen to him.

1376
01:10:58,532 --> 01:11:00,966
Then nothing
would ever happen to him.

1377
01:11:04,004 --> 01:11:06,768
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1378
01:11:15,616 --> 01:11:17,447
What's going on?

1379
01:11:17,485 --> 01:11:19,783
Don't know. I'll ask him.

1380
01:11:22,323 --> 01:11:28,353
- Dory...
- Whaaat's goooing onnn?

1381
01:11:34,401 --> 01:11:35,993
I think he says we've stopped.

1382
01:11:36,036 --> 01:11:39,301
Of course we've stopped.
Stop trying to speak whale.

1383
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:42,138
You'll make things worse.
What is that noise?

1384
01:11:46,247 --> 01:11:49,045
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1385
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:54,043
The water's going down.
It's going down!

1386
01:11:57,758 --> 01:11:59,191
Really? You sure about that?

1387
01:11:59,226 --> 01:12:01,285
Look! Already it's half empty!

1388
01:12:01,328 --> 01:12:03,091
I'd say it's half full.

1389
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:04,597
Stop that! It's half empty!

1390
01:12:07,668 --> 01:12:10,865
OK, that one
was a little tougher.

1391
01:12:10,905 --> 01:12:13,774
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1392
01:12:13,841 --> 01:12:16,002
or he wants a root beer float.

1393
01:12:16,043 --> 01:12:17,670
Of course he wants us
to go there!

1394
01:12:17,711 --> 01:12:19,645
That's eating us!

1395
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,649
How do I taste, Moby?
Do I taste good?

1396
01:12:22,683 --> 01:12:24,947
Tell him I'm not interested
in being lunch!

1397
01:12:24,985 --> 01:12:27,453
- OK. Heee...
- Stop talking to him!

1398
01:12:33,627 --> 01:12:34,787
What is going on?

1399
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:37,127
I'll check. Whaaat...

1400
01:12:37,164 --> 01:12:39,928
No more whale!
You can't speak whale!

1401
01:12:39,967 --> 01:12:42,299
- Yes, I can!
- No, you can't!

1402
01:12:42,336 --> 01:12:45,897
You think you can do these
things, but you can't, Nemo!

1403
01:12:50,911 --> 01:12:53,744
- OK.
- Dory! Oof!

1404
01:12:56,317 --> 01:12:59,912
He says it's time to let go.

1405
01:12:59,954 --> 01:13:01,922
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1406
01:13:01,956 --> 01:13:03,617
How do you know?

1407
01:13:03,657 --> 01:13:06,751
How do you know something bad
isn't gonna happen?

1408
01:13:06,794 --> 01:13:08,694
I don't!

1409
01:13:29,316 --> 01:13:34,083
We're alive!

1410
01:13:35,155 --> 01:13:38,022
Look! Sy-d-ney... Sydney!

1411
01:13:38,058 --> 01:13:40,492
Sydney! Sydney again!

1412
01:13:42,496 --> 01:13:44,964
You were right, Dory!
We made it!

1413
01:13:44,999 --> 01:13:47,934
We're gonna find my son!

1414
01:13:50,504 --> 01:13:53,938
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

1415
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:56,509
I wish I could speak whale.

1416
01:13:56,543 --> 01:13:58,841
All we gotta do is find
the boat that took him.

1417
01:13:58,879 --> 01:14:01,973
- Right!
- We can do this!

1418
01:14:15,596 --> 01:14:17,894
Morning.

1419
01:14:17,932 --> 01:14:21,197
It's morning, everyone!
Today's the day!

1420
01:14:21,235 --> 01:14:23,396
The sun is shining,
the tank is clean...

1421
01:14:23,437 --> 01:14:26,497
and we are getting out...
The tank is clean.

1422
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:29,100
The tank is clean!

1423
01:14:29,143 --> 01:14:30,735
But how?

1424
01:14:30,778 --> 01:14:33,474
Boss must've installed it
while we were sleeping.

1425
01:14:33,514 --> 01:14:36,972
- What are we gonna do?
- What's it say, Peach?

1426
01:14:38,352 --> 01:14:39,683
I can't hear you, Peach.

1427
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,154
The Aquascum 2003 is
an all-purpose, self-cleaning...

1428
01:14:42,189 --> 01:14:44,157
maintenance-free,
salt water purifier...

1429
01:14:44,191 --> 01:14:47,183
that is guaranteed to extend
the life of your aquarium fish.

1430
01:14:47,227 --> 01:14:48,455
Stop it!

1431
01:14:48,495 --> 01:14:49,985
The Aquascum
is programmed to scan...

1432
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:52,328
your tank environment
every five minutes?!

1433
01:14:52,366 --> 01:14:54,061
Scan? What does that mean?

1434
01:14:58,939 --> 01:15:00,440
Temperature... 82 degrees...

1435
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:02,202
PH balance... normal.

1436
01:15:02,242 --> 01:15:04,642
Nice.

1437
01:15:04,678 --> 01:15:09,240
Curse you, Aquascum!

1438
01:15:09,283 --> 01:15:11,376
That's it for the escape plan.
It's ruined.

1439
01:15:11,418 --> 01:15:12,851
Then what are
we gonna do about...

1440
01:15:12,886 --> 01:15:14,854
Darla!

1441
01:15:14,922 --> 01:15:17,516
Stay down, kid!

1442
01:15:17,558 --> 01:15:19,526
False alarm.

1443
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,653
My nerves can't take
much more of this.

1444
01:15:21,695 --> 01:15:23,925
What'll we do
when that brat gets here?

1445
01:15:23,964 --> 01:15:26,194
- I'm thinking.
- Oh! Gill!

1446
01:15:26,233 --> 01:15:29,396
- Nemo! I'm coming!
- Help me! Help me!

1447
01:15:29,436 --> 01:15:33,338
Swim down! Come on, kid!

1448
01:15:33,374 --> 01:15:34,864
- Everybody jump in!
- Swim down!

1449
01:15:34,908 --> 01:15:36,205
- That's it!
- What the...?

1450
01:15:36,243 --> 01:15:39,508
- Yay!
- Good work!

1451
01:15:39,546 --> 01:15:41,070
Gill!

1452
01:15:41,115 --> 01:15:42,707
- Nemo!
- Sharkbait!

1453
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:46,151
- Roll, kid!
- Lean! Lean!

1454
01:15:50,624 --> 01:15:53,058
Whoops.
That would've been a nasty fall.

1455
01:15:53,093 --> 01:15:55,687
Gill! Don't let me go belly-up!

1456
01:15:55,729 --> 01:15:58,027
Just calm down, Nemo.
You won't go belly-up.

1457
01:15:58,065 --> 01:16:00,465
I promise. You're gonna be OK.

1458
01:16:03,437 --> 01:16:05,462
Darla!

1459
01:16:08,942 --> 01:16:12,673
Do any of these boats
look familiar to you?

1460
01:16:12,713 --> 01:16:14,613
No, but the boat
has to be here somewhere.

1461
01:16:14,648 --> 01:16:16,775
Come on, Dory.
We're gonna find it.

1462
01:16:16,817 --> 01:16:19,547
I'm totally excited.
Are you excited?

1463
01:16:19,586 --> 01:16:21,349
Dory, wake up.
Wake up, come on.

1464
01:16:21,388 --> 01:16:23,219
Duck!

1465
01:16:23,257 --> 01:16:26,658
That's not a duck.
It's a... pelican!

1466
01:16:36,003 --> 01:16:39,268
No! I didn't come this far
to be breakfast!

1467
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:49,248
Hey, Nigel.
Would you look at that?

1468
01:16:49,283 --> 01:16:50,648
What? What?

1469
01:16:50,684 --> 01:16:53,551
Sun's barely up and Gerald's
had more than he can handle.

1470
01:16:53,587 --> 01:16:56,215
Yeah. Reckon somebody
ought to help the poor guy.

1471
01:16:56,256 --> 01:16:58,247
Yeah, right. Yeah.

1472
01:16:58,292 --> 01:17:01,921
Don't everybody
fly off at once.

1473
01:17:05,032 --> 01:17:07,967
All right, Gerald.
Fish got your tongue?

1474
01:17:08,001 --> 01:17:10,904
Love a duck!

1475
01:17:11,004 --> 01:17:12,699
I gotta find my son Nemo!

1476
01:17:12,739 --> 01:17:15,833
Nemo? He's that fish!

1477
01:17:15,876 --> 01:17:18,436
The one that's been fighting
the whole ocean!

1478
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:20,947
I know where your son...

1479
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:24,278
Wait! Come back! Stop!

1480
01:17:24,318 --> 01:17:26,548
Dory, keep going! He's crazy!

1481
01:17:26,587 --> 01:17:28,350
I got something to tell you!

1482
01:17:32,693 --> 01:17:34,183
Mine.

1483
01:17:38,265 --> 01:17:41,792
Don't make any sudden moves.

1484
01:17:41,835 --> 01:17:46,101
Hop inside my mouth
if you want to live.

1485
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:49,769
Hop in your mouth?
How does that make me live?

1486
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:50,970
Mine?

1487
01:17:51,011 --> 01:17:54,645
Because
I can take you to your son.

1488
01:17:54,681 --> 01:17:57,343
- Yeah, right.
- No. I know your son.

1489
01:17:57,384 --> 01:18:00,080
He's orange with
a gimpy fin on one side.

1490
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,280
That's Nemo!

1491
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:03,983
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1492
01:18:05,526 --> 01:18:08,017
Fasten your seat belts!

1493
01:18:09,163 --> 01:18:11,290
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1494
01:18:11,365 --> 01:18:13,390
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1495
01:18:29,716 --> 01:18:31,911
Everybody hold on!

1496
01:18:35,289 --> 01:18:37,780
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1497
01:18:43,897 --> 01:18:46,525
Too loud! Too loud for me!

1498
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:48,797
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

1499
01:18:48,835 --> 01:18:51,702
Find a happy place!
Find a happy place!

1500
01:18:51,738 --> 01:18:54,263
Darla, your uncle
will see you now.

1501
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:58,835
All right, let's see
those pearly whites.

1502
01:18:58,879 --> 01:19:03,179
Raah! I'm a piranha.
They're in the Amazon.

1503
01:19:03,217 --> 01:19:06,653
And a piranha's a fish,
just like your present.

1504
01:19:08,021 --> 01:19:09,784
I get fishy, fishy

1505
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:12,917
Oh, no. Poor little guy.

1506
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,791
- He's dead.
- Sharkbait!

1507
01:19:14,828 --> 01:19:16,022
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

1508
01:19:16,063 --> 01:19:17,655
Must've left your present
in the car, sweetie.

1509
01:19:17,698 --> 01:19:19,996
I'll go and get it.

1510
01:19:20,033 --> 01:19:21,762
- He's still alive!
- He's not dead!

1511
01:19:21,802 --> 01:19:23,827
What's happening?
Why is he playing dead?

1512
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:25,735
He's gonna get flushed
down the toilet.

1513
01:19:25,772 --> 01:19:28,172
- He's gonna get out of here!
- He's gonna get flushed!

1514
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:29,971
What a smart little guy!

1515
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:31,568
Oh, no! Not the trash can!

1516
01:19:31,612 --> 01:19:32,909
Nemo! No!

1517
01:19:32,946 --> 01:19:36,347
- Hey! I found his dad!
- Where's Nemo?

1518
01:19:36,383 --> 01:19:37,748
- Dentist!
- He's over there!

1519
01:19:37,784 --> 01:19:41,185
What's a dentist?
Nigel, get in there!

1520
01:19:41,221 --> 01:19:45,180
- I can't go in there!
- Yes, you can! Charge!

1521
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,184
What the...?

1522
01:19:49,463 --> 01:19:52,057
Darla, sweetie, look out!

1523
01:19:55,469 --> 01:19:57,630
Hold still!

1524
01:19:57,671 --> 01:19:59,605
Easy! Easy!

1525
01:20:00,907 --> 01:20:02,135
Hold still!

1526
01:20:02,175 --> 01:20:05,338
Nobody's going to hurt you!
Oof!

1527
01:20:11,418 --> 01:20:13,818
Nemo.

1528
01:20:13,854 --> 01:20:15,116
Oh, my goodness.

1529
01:20:15,155 --> 01:20:17,055
Gotcha! Keep down!

1530
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:18,352
Nemo!

1531
01:20:18,392 --> 01:20:20,121
Daddy?

1532
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:23,994
Out with you! And stay out!

1533
01:20:24,031 --> 01:20:25,362
Daddy?

1534
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:26,798
Fishy?

1535
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:29,961
Fishy! Wake up!

1536
01:20:30,003 --> 01:20:31,163
Oh, no!

1537
01:20:31,204 --> 01:20:33,729
To the top of
Mount Wannahockaloogie!

1538
01:20:33,774 --> 01:20:36,174
Why are you sleeping?

1539
01:20:36,209 --> 01:20:38,643
- Hurry!
- Bloat!

1540
01:20:41,715 --> 01:20:43,808
Ring of Fire!

1541
01:20:44,818 --> 01:20:48,379
Fishy!

1542
01:20:49,856 --> 01:20:51,915
Crikey! All the animals
have gone mad!

1543
01:20:53,727 --> 01:20:56,287
Aaah! Get it out!

1544
01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:58,890
- Smack her in the head!
- Go, Gill, go!

1545
01:20:58,932 --> 01:21:00,923
Fish in my hair!

1546
01:21:00,967 --> 01:21:02,332
Gill!

1547
01:21:02,369 --> 01:21:06,863
Sharkbait...
tell your dad I said hi.

1548
01:21:11,912 --> 01:21:13,174
Go get 'em!

1549
01:21:18,185 --> 01:21:19,914
- He did it!
- Yay!

1550
01:21:19,953 --> 01:21:22,888
- I'm so happy!
- Is he gonna be OK, Gill?

1551
01:21:22,923 --> 01:21:25,153
Don't worry.
All drains lead to the ocean.

1552
01:21:25,192 --> 01:21:26,921
Fishy!

1553
01:21:34,468 --> 01:21:36,800
Daddy!

1554
01:22:12,606 --> 01:22:15,439
I'm so sorry.

1555
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:18,077
Truly, I am.

1556
01:22:18,078 --> 01:22:18,908
Truly, I am.

1557
01:22:36,263 --> 01:22:38,458
- Hey.
- Dory...

1558
01:22:38,498 --> 01:22:40,557
if it wasn't for you...

1559
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,398
I never would've even
made it here.

1560
01:22:43,437 --> 01:22:45,428
So, thank you.

1561
01:22:47,541 --> 01:22:49,270
Hey, wait a minute.

1562
01:22:49,309 --> 01:22:51,869
Wait. Where are you going?

1563
01:22:51,912 --> 01:22:55,473
It's over, Dory.
We were too late.

1564
01:22:55,515 --> 01:23:00,282
Nemo's gone,
and I'm going home now.

1565
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,811
No. No, you can't.

1566
01:23:04,658 --> 01:23:06,421
Stop!

1567
01:23:08,028 --> 01:23:09,791
Please don't go away.

1568
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:11,764
Please?

1569
01:23:11,798 --> 01:23:14,562
No one's ever stuck with me
for so long before.

1570
01:23:14,601 --> 01:23:18,162
And if you leave, I just...

1571
01:23:18,205 --> 01:23:20,139
I remember things
better with you.

1572
01:23:20,173 --> 01:23:23,165
I do. Look... P. Sherman, 42...

1573
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:26,145
42...

1574
01:23:26,179 --> 01:23:28,943
I remember it.
I do. It's there.

1575
01:23:28,982 --> 01:23:31,075
I know it is because
when I look at you...

1576
01:23:31,117 --> 01:23:32,550
I can feel it.

1577
01:23:32,586 --> 01:23:38,388
I look at you
and I... I'm home.

1578
01:23:40,227 --> 01:23:41,819
Please...

1579
01:23:41,862 --> 01:23:44,490
I don't want that to go away.

1580
01:23:44,531 --> 01:23:46,897
I don't want to forget.

1581
01:23:48,235 --> 01:23:52,296
I'm sorry, Dory, but I do.

1582
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:06,848
- Manna from heaven.
- Sweet nectar of life!

1583
01:24:06,887 --> 01:24:08,946
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1584
01:24:08,989 --> 01:24:12,390
- This is our spot!
- Get outta here!

1585
01:24:13,727 --> 01:24:15,820
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1586
01:24:15,929 --> 01:24:17,396
Yeah, that's it, fella.

1587
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:19,057
Just keep on swimmin'.
You got that.

1588
01:24:19,099 --> 01:24:21,124
Too right, mate!

1589
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:22,464
Oh! I got a live one here!

1590
01:24:22,502 --> 01:24:23,935
Have you seen my dad?

1591
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:26,200
Gotcha! Hey! Hey!
Come back here!

1592
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:27,729
You let him go!

1593
01:24:27,774 --> 01:24:29,909
Hey! Hey!

1594
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:34,404
Dad! Dad!

1595
01:24:34,447 --> 01:24:36,074
Dad!

1596
01:24:49,462 --> 01:24:52,522
Excuse me.

1597
01:24:52,566 --> 01:24:53,794
Are you all right?

1598
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:56,461
I don't know where I am.
I don't know what's going on.

1599
01:24:56,503 --> 01:24:59,370
I think I lost somebody,
but I can't remember.

1600
01:24:59,406 --> 01:25:03,502
It's OK.
I'm looking for someone, too.

1601
01:25:03,543 --> 01:25:05,977
Hey, we can look together.

1602
01:25:06,012 --> 01:25:08,344
I'm Dory.

1603
01:25:08,381 --> 01:25:09,541
I'm Nemo.

1604
01:25:09,583 --> 01:25:12,950
Nemo? That's a nice name.

1605
01:25:21,895 --> 01:25:24,830
- Dad!
- Dad!

1606
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,923
Wait a minute.
Is it your dad or my dad?

1607
01:25:26,967 --> 01:25:29,435
- My dad.
- Got it. Dad!

1608
01:25:29,469 --> 01:25:31,733
- Where are we, anyway?
- Dad! Dad!

1609
01:25:31,771 --> 01:25:35,673
Oh. Syl... Shi... Sydney.

1610
01:25:35,709 --> 01:25:39,975
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

1611
01:25:40,013 --> 01:25:41,776
Nemo!

1612
01:25:41,815 --> 01:25:44,181
It's you! You're Nemo!

1613
01:25:44,217 --> 01:25:45,878
Yes, yes, I'm Nemo!

1614
01:25:45,919 --> 01:25:48,513
You're Nemo!
You were dead. I saw you.

1615
01:25:48,555 --> 01:25:50,455
And here you are! I found you.

1616
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:53,220
You're not dead.
And your father... Your father!

1617
01:25:53,259 --> 01:25:55,625
You know my father?!
Where is he?

1618
01:25:55,662 --> 01:25:58,495
This way!
He went this way. Quick!

1619
01:25:58,531 --> 01:26:00,158
Hey, hey, hey!

1620
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,360
Hey! Hey!

1621
01:26:01,401 --> 01:26:02,891
Have you seen
an orange fish swim by?

1622
01:26:02,936 --> 01:26:05,302
- It looks just like him!
- But bigger!

1623
01:26:05,338 --> 01:26:06,566
Yeah, I saw him, bluey.

1624
01:26:06,606 --> 01:26:08,073
But I'm not tellin' you
where he went...

1625
01:26:08,108 --> 01:26:13,646
and there's no way
you're gonna make me.

1626
01:26:13,647 --> 01:26:14,807
Mine.

1627
01:26:14,914 --> 01:26:17,678
All right! I'll talk!

1628
01:26:17,717 --> 01:26:24,423
He went to the fishing grounds!

1629
01:26:24,424 --> 01:26:26,289
Hey, look out!

1630
01:26:26,326 --> 01:26:28,817
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get home.

1631
01:26:29,863 --> 01:26:33,594
Dad! Dad!

1632
01:26:33,633 --> 01:26:35,032
Nemo?

1633
01:26:35,068 --> 01:26:37,536
- Daddy!
- Nemo?

1634
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:39,539
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!

1635
01:26:39,606 --> 01:26:41,597
Dory? Nemo!

1636
01:26:41,641 --> 01:26:42,835
Daddy!

1637
01:26:42,876 --> 01:26:45,174
Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!

1638
01:26:45,211 --> 01:26:48,874
- Dad!
- Nemo! Thank goodness.

1639
01:26:48,915 --> 01:26:51,850
It's all right, son.
It's gonna be OK.

1640
01:26:51,885 --> 01:26:54,754
Turn around!
You're going the wrong way!

1641
01:26:57,257 --> 01:26:58,622
Look out!

1642
01:26:58,658 --> 01:27:01,286
Oh, my...

1643
01:27:18,011 --> 01:27:21,572
Help! He-e-elp!

1644
01:27:21,614 --> 01:27:23,206
- Dory!
- Come on!

1645
01:27:23,249 --> 01:27:24,648
Help! Help!

1646
01:27:24,684 --> 01:27:27,414
Help! Get us out!

1647
01:27:27,454 --> 01:27:29,251
No, no, no! Dory!

1648
01:27:29,289 --> 01:27:32,281
- Dad, I know what to do!
- Nemo! No!

1649
01:27:32,325 --> 01:27:35,055
We have to tell all the fish
to swim down together!

1650
01:27:35,095 --> 01:27:37,791
- Get out of there now!
- I know this will work!

1651
01:27:37,831 --> 01:27:39,765
No, I am not
gonna lose you again!

1652
01:27:39,799 --> 01:27:43,235
There's no time!
It's the only way to save Dory!

1653
01:27:44,537 --> 01:27:46,004
I can do this.

1654
01:27:47,173 --> 01:27:49,300
You're right.

1655
01:27:49,342 --> 01:27:51,173
I know you can.

1656
01:27:51,211 --> 01:27:54,112
- Lucky fin!
- Now, go! Hurry!

1657
01:27:54,147 --> 01:27:56,945
Tell all the fish to swim down!

1658
01:27:56,983 --> 01:28:00,350
Well? You heard my son!
Come on!

1659
01:28:01,855 --> 01:28:04,483
Dory, you have
to tell everybody to...

1660
01:28:04,524 --> 01:28:06,048
Swim down together!

1661
01:28:06,092 --> 01:28:08,356
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

1662
01:28:08,394 --> 01:28:10,658
Swim down!

1663
01:28:15,001 --> 01:28:16,229
Everybody swim down!

1664
01:28:16,269 --> 01:28:18,794
Come on, you have to swim down!

1665
01:28:18,838 --> 01:28:21,534
Down! Swim down!

1666
01:28:23,643 --> 01:28:27,272
Swim down! Swim down!

1667
01:28:34,988 --> 01:28:37,388
Don't give up! Keep swimming!

1668
01:28:37,423 --> 01:28:39,857
Just keep swimming!

1669
01:28:44,097 --> 01:28:45,724
That's it!

1670
01:28:48,668 --> 01:28:50,659
It's working!

1671
01:28:53,106 --> 01:28:56,132
Keep swimming! Keep swimming!

1672
01:28:56,176 --> 01:28:58,303
Just keep swimming!
Keep swimming!

1673
01:28:58,344 --> 01:28:59,811
Come on, Dad!

1674
01:28:59,846 --> 01:29:02,337
- You're doing great, son!
- That's my dad.

1675
01:29:02,382 --> 01:29:04,680
Let's get to the bottom!
Keep swimming!

1676
01:29:04,717 --> 01:29:07,242
Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming

1677
01:29:07,287 --> 01:29:09,482
Almost there! Keep swimming!

1678
01:29:13,059 --> 01:29:14,390
Keep swimming!

1679
01:29:16,696 --> 01:29:17,822
Keep swimming!

1680
01:29:28,241 --> 01:29:29,708
- Oof!
- Hey!

1681
01:29:29,742 --> 01:29:33,337
- Dory! Where's Nemo?
- There!

1682
01:29:35,048 --> 01:29:38,108
Oh, no. Nemo!

1683
01:29:44,057 --> 01:29:45,957
Nemo?

1684
01:29:47,627 --> 01:29:49,925
Nemo?

1685
01:29:49,963 --> 01:29:53,956
It's OK. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.

1686
01:29:58,404 --> 01:29:59,564
Daddy?

1687
01:29:59,606 --> 01:30:01,130
Oh, thank goodness.

1688
01:30:01,174 --> 01:30:04,871
Dad... I don't hate you.

1689
01:30:04,911 --> 01:30:06,742
Oh, no, no, no.

1690
01:30:06,779 --> 01:30:09,441
I'm so sorry, Nemo.

1691
01:30:18,691 --> 01:30:21,558
- Hey, guess what?
- What?

1692
01:30:21,594 --> 01:30:25,086
Sea turtles... I met one.

1693
01:30:25,131 --> 01:30:29,329
And he was 150 years old.

1694
01:30:29,369 --> 01:30:33,533
- 150?
- Yep.

1695
01:30:33,573 --> 01:30:38,408
Sandy Plankton said
they only live to be 100.

1696
01:30:38,444 --> 01:30:40,002
Sandy Plankton?

1697
01:30:40,046 --> 01:30:42,037
Do you think I would
cross the entire ocean...

1698
01:30:42,081 --> 01:30:44,174
and not know as much
as Sandy Plankton?

1699
01:30:44,217 --> 01:30:46,879
He was 150! Not 100!

1700
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:50,788
Who is this Sandy Plankton
who knows everything?

1701
01:30:52,492 --> 01:30:56,092
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1702
01:30:56,129 --> 01:30:59,223
- I'm gonna win!
- No, you're not!

1703
01:30:59,265 --> 01:31:03,031
- I did it!
- Aw, my own son beats me!

1704
01:31:03,069 --> 01:31:05,537
Climb aboard, explorers.

1705
01:31:05,571 --> 01:31:08,699
The sea cucumber looks over
to the mollusk and says...

1706
01:31:08,741 --> 01:31:11,608
"With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?"

1707
01:31:13,313 --> 01:31:15,543
Hello, Nemo. Who's this?

1708
01:31:15,648 --> 01:31:19,106
- Exchange student.
- I'm from the E.A.C., dude!

1709
01:31:19,152 --> 01:31:21,780
- Sweet!
- Totally.

1710
01:31:21,821 --> 01:31:23,789
Seriously, Marty.

1711
01:31:23,823 --> 01:31:25,791
Did you really do all
the things you say you did?

1712
01:31:25,825 --> 01:31:27,520
Pardon me.

1713
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,256
Hello.

1714
01:31:30,296 --> 01:31:31,957
Don't be alarmed.

1715
01:31:31,998 --> 01:31:35,764
We wanted to make sure our
newest member got home safely.

1716
01:31:35,802 --> 01:31:38,134
- Thanks, guys.
- See you next week.

1717
01:31:38,171 --> 01:31:41,629
- Keep up with the program.
- Remember, fish are friends...

1718
01:31:41,674 --> 01:31:44,040
Not food! Bye!

1719
01:31:44,077 --> 01:31:45,942
Hold on, here we go!

1720
01:31:45,979 --> 01:31:47,674
Next stop... knowledge!

1721
01:31:47,714 --> 01:31:50,182
Bye, son! Have fun!

1722
01:31:50,216 --> 01:31:51,513
Bye, Dad!

1723
01:31:51,551 --> 01:31:54,987
Oh! Mr. Ray, wait.
I forgot something.

1724
01:31:59,659 --> 01:32:02,287
Love you, Dad.

1725
01:32:02,328 --> 01:32:04,319
I love you, too, son.

1726
01:32:06,599 --> 01:32:10,000
Dad? You can let go now.

1727
01:32:10,036 --> 01:32:13,767
Sorry. Go have an adventure.

1728
01:32:13,806 --> 01:32:16,036
Good-bye! See ya later, dudes!

1729
01:32:16,142 --> 01:32:18,576
- Bye, Elmo!
- Nemo.

1730
01:32:18,611 --> 01:32:22,069
- Bye, Nemo!
- See you after school, Dory!

1731
01:32:22,115 --> 01:32:25,015
Bye, Dad!

1732
01:32:25,018 --> 01:32:27,111
Bye, son.

1733
01:32:44,137 --> 01:32:47,129
Barbara, I don't understand it.

1734
01:32:47,173 --> 01:32:49,539
Here this thing has
a lifetime guarantee...

1735
01:32:49,575 --> 01:32:50,803
and it breaks!

1736
01:32:50,843 --> 01:32:53,141
I had to clean the tank myself,
take all the fish out...

1737
01:32:53,179 --> 01:32:55,545
put 'em in bags, and...

1738
01:32:55,581 --> 01:32:58,072
Where'd the fish go?

1739
01:33:02,922 --> 01:33:04,651
- Come on, Peach!
- Hurry!

1740
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:06,521
- You can do it!
- That's it.

1741
01:33:06,559 --> 01:33:07,992
Just a little further.

1742
01:33:08,027 --> 01:33:10,257
That's the shortest
red light I've ever seen!

1743
01:33:10,296 --> 01:33:12,526
Come on, Peach!

1744
01:33:21,874 --> 01:33:23,671
Now what?

1745
01:33:31,175 --> 01:33:34,303
Somewhere

1746
01:33:34,345 --> 01:33:36,506
Beyond the sea

1747
01:33:36,547 --> 01:33:41,678
Somewhere, waitin' for me

1748
01:33:41,719 --> 01:33:46,656
My lover stands on golden sands

1749
01:33:46,691 --> 01:33:49,091
And watches the ships

1750
01:33:49,127 --> 01:33:53,154
That go sailin'

1751
01:33:53,197 --> 01:33:56,132
Somewhere

1752
01:33:56,167 --> 01:33:58,499
Beyond the sea

1753
01:33:58,536 --> 01:34:03,633
She's there watchin' for me

1754
01:34:03,674 --> 01:34:08,509
if I could fly
like birds on high

1755
01:34:08,546 --> 01:34:11,242
Then straight to her arms

1756
01:34:11,282 --> 01:34:14,945
I'll go sailin'

1757
01:34:14,986 --> 01:34:18,046
It's far

1758
01:34:18,089 --> 01:34:20,751
Beyond the stars

1759
01:34:20,792 --> 01:34:24,728
It's near, beyond the moon

1760
01:34:25,730 --> 01:34:29,166
I know

1761
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,327
Beyond a doubt

1762
01:34:31,369 --> 01:34:33,337
My heart

1763
01:34:33,371 --> 01:34:36,898
Will lead me there soon

1764
01:34:36,941 --> 01:34:39,910
We'll meet

1765
01:34:39,944 --> 01:34:42,469
Beyond the shore

1766
01:34:42,513 --> 01:34:47,382
We'll kiss just like before

1767
01:34:47,418 --> 01:34:52,253
Happy we'll be beyond the sea

1768
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:54,622
And never again

1769
01:34:54,659 --> 01:34:58,527
I'll go sailin'

1770
01:35:30,294 --> 01:35:34,822
I know

1771
01:35:34,866 --> 01:35:37,494
Beyond a doubt

1772
01:35:37,535 --> 01:35:39,435
My heart

1773
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:43,167
Will lead me there soon

1774
01:35:43,207 --> 01:35:45,971
Oh, we'll meet,
I know we'll meet

1775
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:48,410
Beyond the shore

1776
01:35:48,446 --> 01:35:53,577
We'll kiss just as before

1777
01:35:53,618 --> 01:35:58,578
Happy we will be beyond the sea

1778
01:35:58,623 --> 01:36:00,750
And never again

1779
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:04,420
I'll go sailin'

1780
01:36:06,464 --> 01:36:08,830
No more sailin'

1781
01:36:10,201 --> 01:36:13,568
So long, sailin', sailin'

1782
01:36:13,604 --> 01:36:15,902
No more sailin'

1783
01:36:17,508 --> 01:36:21,501
Good-bye, farewell, my friend

1784
01:36:21,545 --> 01:36:23,308
No more sailin'

1785
01:36:25,416 --> 01:36:27,179
So long

1786
01:36:27,218 --> 01:36:29,345
Sailin'

1787
01:36:29,387 --> 01:36:31,048
No more sailin'

1788
01:36:34,392 --> 01:36:36,087
No more

1789
01:36:36,127 --> 01:36:37,958
Farewell

1790
01:36:39,931 --> 01:36:41,796
Auf wiedersehen

1791
01:36:41,832 --> 01:36:45,199
Adieu to you and you

1792
01:36:50,875 --> 01:36:52,866
No more sailin'

1793
01:36:54,645 --> 01:36:56,203
No more

1794
01:36:56,247 --> 01:37:01,048
No more sailin'

1795
01:37:02,987 --> 01:37:06,889
No more, no more

1796
01:37:09,026 --> 01:37:15,192
No more sailin'

1797
01:37:20,071 --> 01:37:21,868
No more

1798
01:37:23,741 --> 01:37:25,470
One more time

1799
01:37:26,877 --> 01:37:34,306
No more sailin'

1800
01:37:35,305 --> 01:38:35,410
