1
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:05,154
Some call Bregna the perfect society.

2
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:09,559
Some call it
the height of human civilization.

3
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:14,202
But others know better.

4
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:20,272
The Goodchilds built Bregna
to ensure us a future.

5
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,245
They built the Relical...

6
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:29,644
a memorial to remind us
of what we've survived.

7
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:35,255
They built walls to protect us.

8
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:42,056
They tell us that outside,
nature has retaken the world.

9
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:50,705
But the real problems lie within.

10
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,574
We are haunted
by sorrows we cannot name.

11
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:01,212
People disappear...

12
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,614
and our government
denies these crimes.

13
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,884
The Goodchild regime provides for us,
as long as we stay quiet.

14
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:15,290
So we trade freedom for a gilded cage.

15
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:20,103
But there are rebels
who refuse to make that trade...

16
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:24,439
who fight to overthrow a government
that silences us...

17
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:29,113
who fight
in the name of the disappeared.

18
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:36,347
They call themselves the Monicans.

19
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:41,385
I am one of them.

20
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:52,457
Handler.

21
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,089
Aeon.

22
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:57,291
We have an assignment.

23
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,631
We want you to sabotage Goodchild's
central surveillance facility.

24
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:07,006
Your entry will be noticed, but we will
briefly disrupt their interior alarms.

25
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,878
Surveillance is their greatest tool
against us.

26
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,681
As long as Monicans can be seen,
we can be targeted.

27
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:17,778
We need you to blind them.

28
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:24,221
Each mission brings us closer
to defeating the Goodchild regime.

29
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:32,696
This is my daughter.
Have you seen her?

30
00:05:32,804 --> 00:05:34,772
She disappeared two months ago.

31
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:38,371
Help me, please, miss.
Have you seen this girl?

32
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,578
She disappeared two months ago.

33
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:43,443
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

34
00:05:43,582 --> 00:05:45,880
Visit our sleep center for help.

35
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:50,720
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?
Visit our sleep...

36
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:52,585
Shopping for me, Una?

37
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:55,952
Haven't you heard?
It's a special occasion.

38
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:58,689
My sister's finally coming to dinner.

39
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:01,725
Claudius and I
are looking forward to tonight.

40
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,961
For once, you'll be in the house
long enough to sit down.

41
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,504
That's why
I wanted to meet with you here.

42
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:09,765
Aeon.

43
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,070
I may not make it tonight, I'm sorry.

44
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,344
Don't be upset.

45
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:17,745
It's not that you can't come to dinner.

46
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:19,910
It's why.

47
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:22,418
You know,
I used to imagine you'd come with me.

48
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:25,115
We have different ways
of solving problems.

49
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:27,714
Yes. You ignore them.

50
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:30,259
How could I possibly ignore them?

51
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:32,760
Excuse me. This is my daughter.

52
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:37,401
I see the problems. I feel them.

53
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:41,663
And I'm trying
to make something good out of it.

54
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,836
- A life.
- What kind of life is it?

55
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:51,578
There are good things here.

56
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:56,180
There's one.

57
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:04,085
- So I have a surprise for you.
- Tell me.

58
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:06,657
Tonight.

59
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:10,701
So be careful.

60
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,437
And come back.

61
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:17,704
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

62
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:19,970
Visit our sleep center for help.

63
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:23,742
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

64
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:25,680
Visit our sleep center for help.

65
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,827
Possible Monican consort.
Three subjects.

66
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:48,056
Identification requested.

67
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,598
Possible Monican activity suspected.

68
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:02,239
It's not that you can't come to dinner.

69
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:03,336
It's why.

70
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:07,380
You know,
I used to imagine you'd come with me.

71
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:14,992
I think we have different ways
of solving problems.

72
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:17,928
This is the way things are
and I'm trying...

73
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:20,793
to make something good out of it. A life.

74
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,984
You're early, Claudius.

75
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:31,199
But they're everywhere.

76
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,562
We need to protect you from them.

77
00:10:56,661 --> 00:10:59,391
This is how Chairman Goodchild
deals with Monicans.

78
00:10:59,497 --> 00:11:00,964
But she wasn't...

79
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,663
She wasn't a Monican.

80
00:11:19,217 --> 00:11:20,946
I had a family once.

81
00:11:24,923 --> 00:11:26,390
I had a life.

82
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,758
Now all I have is a mission.

83
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:45,934
Una.

84
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:49,280
Aeon.

85
00:11:49,914 --> 00:11:51,745
Aeon, Una.

86
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,112
Aeon.

87
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:54,646
Come back.

88
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:41,889
Yes.

89
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,430
She will see you now.

90
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,810
Handler.

91
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:01,445
Aeon.

92
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,478
We have an assignment.

93
00:13:04,322 --> 00:13:05,914
One you've been waiting for.

94
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:07,286
Goodchild.

95
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,652
We've intercepted information that
will allow us to penetrate his security.

96
00:13:13,498 --> 00:13:15,432
We want you to eliminate him.

97
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,059
You should've sent me in earlier.

98
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:20,998
- That would've been suicide.
- Not for me.

99
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:22,402
Patience, Aeon.

100
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:25,305
It has taken a year
to get the information we need.

101
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:27,603
I know you want to do this for Una.

102
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,242
But you must remember,
this is larger than you.

103
00:13:32,283 --> 00:13:35,218
She's not the only innocent person
who's been killed.

104
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:39,950
This is our moment.

105
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:42,455
We have never been stronger.

106
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:45,186
People are frightened, yes...

107
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:47,355
but if we show them the way...

108
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:49,831
they will rise behind us when he's gone.

109
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:51,732
I'm ready.

110
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:07,776
Tomorrow, Goodchild will be preparing
his address to the Council.

111
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:12,486
To reach the government zone, you
will need to cross the frontier garden.

112
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,856
Once you are through the garden,
you must move quickly to the Citadel.

113
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:21,130
The underground interior has been built
to be confusing.

114
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:24,861
We've implanted a route for you.
Follow it.

115
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,900
I want Sithandra with me
for the crossing.

116
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:30,566
Of course. Get to the Forum.

117
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:33,041
That's where
Chairman Goodchild will be.

118
00:14:33,711 --> 00:14:35,679
You know what to do from there.

119
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,004
Yes.

120
00:14:38,716 --> 00:14:41,310
Do this and you will have your revenge.

121
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:43,878
And we will all have our victory.

122
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:02,998
Hello, Sithandra.

123
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:08,873
- Still can't surprise you.
- Not yet.

124
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:14,746
How are the modifications?

125
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:25,789
Useful.

126
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:28,058
You should have it done.

127
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,696
I like my shoes.

128
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:38,737
Warning. End of civilian zone.
Do not proceed.

129
00:15:45,283 --> 00:15:47,717
Warning. Do not proceed.

130
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:48,945
Ready?

131
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:51,112
Always.

132
00:15:51,222 --> 00:15:53,417
Warning. Do not proceed.

133
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:06,723
- Sithandra.
- Let's keep moving.

134
00:17:07,965 --> 00:17:10,559
- We understand these now?
- Completely.

135
00:18:08,092 --> 00:18:09,957
I'd keep off the grass.

136
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:19,636
- Rendezvous at 1620.
- I'll be waiting.

137
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:24,831
I agree with the policy
of targeting proven Monican threats.

138
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:27,367
But I'm afraid we're going too far.

139
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,666
We can't go too far with them.

140
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:36,410
There are advantages
to showing a degree of leniency.

141
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:40,075
We can't allow them the luxury of hope.
Not even one of them.

142
00:19:40,217 --> 00:19:42,481
Brute force isn't the only option.

143
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:44,052
It's an effective one.

144
00:19:44,155 --> 00:19:46,817
The Monicans are growing strong.
Soon, force won't be enough.

145
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:49,392
So you want to compromise?
Negotiate?

146
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,919
The policy should be reconsidered.

147
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,966
- Put to a vote.
- The policy is not up for debate!

148
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:58,761
I'm debating it!

149
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:05,474
I'd encourage you to look at this
with a little more detachment, Giroux.

150
00:20:06,077 --> 00:20:08,637
Here, we must be impersonal.

151
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:13,940
You wouldn't want me to take
your outburst personally, would you?

152
00:20:32,637 --> 00:20:34,002
That is all.

153
00:20:36,907 --> 00:20:38,101
Oren?

154
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:49,912
I'm getting worried about you, Oren.
This edge you've taken.

155
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:51,852
Displays like that aren't helpful to us.

156
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:55,050
I believe in protecting what we've
created. I won't apologize for that.

157
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:57,627
This was created
to allow me to do my work.

158
00:20:57,962 --> 00:21:00,931
I can't do that
if you can't control yourself.

159
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,231
- Understood.
- Is it?

160
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:06,403
Yes.

161
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,870
- And what about the test results?
- All negative.

162
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,070
Sorry.

163
00:21:16,547 --> 00:21:18,481
Find me a new test group by morning.

164
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:22,213
Maybe it's time
to give up on the tests, Trevor.

165
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,012
We're living the solution already.
This is perfection.

166
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:29,422
- Why can't you just embrace it?
- You see what's happening to people.

167
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:31,256
You know
how desperate this has become.

168
00:21:31,362 --> 00:21:33,922
It can be contained. Controlled.

169
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:37,798
I think you're forgetting
that this was all meant to be temporary.

170
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:40,703
We've always said that,
but why should it be?

171
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:42,170
Because it's wrong.

172
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:43,700
Things change.

173
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:46,606
But I know you won't.

174
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:48,838
You know me.

175
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:50,971
I've been your brother a long time.

176
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:53,182
You're right about that.

177
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:55,013
Trevor, your speech.

178
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:58,649
Trevor...

179
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:18,902
Useless.

180
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:37,259
- State destination.
- Forum.

181
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:40,254
Proceed forward.

182
00:22:45,903 --> 00:22:47,666
Proceed left.

183
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:51,638
I know you have fears.

184
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:55,909
You have sorrows that shake your belief
and try your patience.

185
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,240
But now more than ever,
we must stand together...

186
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,477
because there are those among us...

187
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:04,145
who would tear down
what we have built.

188
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:06,887
The Monicans seek to divide us.

189
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:09,287
We must never forget who we are...

190
00:23:09,393 --> 00:23:12,294
a lonely outpost, a tiny band.

191
00:23:13,063 --> 00:23:16,590
We're all that remains of a people
that once covered the Earth.

192
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:19,563
We must adapt together
to these new challenges.

193
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:24,907
Remember what we have faced,
what we have survived.

194
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,277
We will adapt.

195
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:33,049
We have always adapted.

196
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:42,757
It's the fabric of who we are.

197
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,235
Katherine.

198
00:24:08,552 --> 00:24:09,780
It's you.

199
00:24:28,005 --> 00:24:29,302
Katherine.

200
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:22,191
Wait outside.

201
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:35,463
Aeon.

202
00:25:36,373 --> 00:25:38,466
You called me by another name earlier.

203
00:25:38,575 --> 00:25:41,305
I did, and you let me live.

204
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:44,709
Give me my gun. We'll try it again.

205
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:46,641
Maybe later.

206
00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:49,981
What was that name?

207
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:53,854
You know me, don't you?

208
00:25:54,858 --> 00:25:55,847
No.

209
00:25:56,827 --> 00:25:58,624
Do you know who you are?

210
00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:02,990
- I know I came here to kill you.
- That's why you're in a cell.

211
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:07,699
But we're both still alive for a reason.

212
00:26:13,143 --> 00:26:15,111
I don't know what this is...

213
00:26:17,815 --> 00:26:19,908
but it's good to see you.

214
00:26:57,554 --> 00:26:58,953
Amateurs.

215
00:28:06,523 --> 00:28:07,820
Good boys.

216
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:43,520
- Aeon.
- Little busy, Sithandra.

217
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:44,958
Is it done?

218
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:48,389
I need more time.

219
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,630
Our information on him may be wrong.

220
00:28:50,734 --> 00:28:53,862
I don't understand this.
We have to move. I hope you...

221
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:56,166
Don't question me, Sithandra.

222
00:28:58,008 --> 00:28:59,305
I'll contact you soon.

223
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:02,242
Aeon, you know
there will be consequences to this.

224
00:29:02,446 --> 00:29:04,277
I know what I'm doing.

225
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,176
This is outrageous.

226
00:29:08,285 --> 00:29:10,412
One Monican
eluding all of our defenses?

227
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:11,920
The problem will be taken care of.

228
00:29:12,022 --> 00:29:14,320
The problem is
Trevor's concept of security.

229
00:29:14,424 --> 00:29:16,483
He needs to learn to accept
more traditional...

230
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:18,857
He needs to learn to accept our input.

231
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:22,065
Another example of him pursuing his
own agenda, no matter what we think.

232
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:24,999
- I'm beginning to question his agenda.
- Meaning?

233
00:29:25,102 --> 00:29:27,730
The Monican tries to kill him
and he lets her live?

234
00:29:27,838 --> 00:29:29,271
An unusual choice.

235
00:29:29,873 --> 00:29:31,340
And now she's escaped.

236
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:33,102
Does anyone believe
this is a coincidence?

237
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,041
Do you really think
that I'm a sympathetic ear...

238
00:29:35,145 --> 00:29:37,204
for your complaints about Trevor?

239
00:29:38,382 --> 00:29:41,180
You don't have the right
to question what he does.

240
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:43,378
You must be concerned, Oren.

241
00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:45,946
This is hardly routine.

242
00:29:47,224 --> 00:29:49,317
I think I should talk with Trevor.

243
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,324
And I think
all of you should be more discreet.

244
00:29:55,132 --> 00:29:56,258
Inari?

245
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:02,396
Image retrieval commencing.

246
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,302
What happened?

247
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,099
My sources were clear on this.

248
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,337
Aeon Flux
is the best the Monicans have.

249
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:11,141
- She failed.
- It's the first time she has.

250
00:30:11,949 --> 00:30:13,712
I wanted this done cleanly.

251
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:17,482
- My brother...
- Will be vulnerable.

252
00:30:18,655 --> 00:30:20,054
Preparing his speech...

253
00:30:20,157 --> 00:30:22,216
Tomorrow, 1300...

254
00:30:24,628 --> 00:30:26,789
It can't be traced to you, in any case.

255
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,497
That's comforting.

256
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:30,589
We did everything correctly.

257
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:33,329
- She had her opportunity.
- And she stopped.

258
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,930
Why?

259
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,934
- I don't know.
- Image retrieval underway.

260
00:30:40,244 --> 00:30:42,542
It'll be too risky to call another hit.

261
00:30:42,646 --> 00:30:45,513
The Monicans may suspect
they are being used.

262
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:50,312
Stop.

263
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:53,681
Oren?

264
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:55,680
No.

265
00:30:57,628 --> 00:30:59,255
That's impossible.

266
00:31:12,442 --> 00:31:13,568
Claudius.

267
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:19,315
- Why are you still here?
- It's not as simple as you think.

268
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,944
Una is murdered and you keep working
for the people who did it?

269
00:31:23,053 --> 00:31:25,180
- What should I be thinking?
- You don't know.

270
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:27,086
What don't I know?

271
00:31:27,724 --> 00:31:29,248
They killed her.

272
00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:32,488
- And you're still alive.
- You killed her, Aeon.

273
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:35,763
They thought she was a Monican,
that's why she died.

274
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,333
- Una's life was worth more than that.
- She was all I had.

275
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:44,000
You're not the only one.

276
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,606
What are you
really doing here, Claudius?

277
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:51,808
Working.

278
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:54,878
It's all that's left.

279
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:57,351
Working. For Trevor Goodchild.

280
00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:00,516
I blamed him, too.

281
00:32:00,624 --> 00:32:02,888
But now
I don't think it was Trevor's fault.

282
00:32:02,993 --> 00:32:04,756
Trevor's trying to help.

283
00:32:04,861 --> 00:32:08,820
Something is wrong with us, Aeon.
With everybody.

284
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:12,297
You have the dreams, don't you?

285
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:15,231
Memories of things
that never happened to you?

286
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:17,603
Una had them. I have them.

287
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,767
It's happening all across Bregna.

288
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:21,935
- What is it?
- I don't know.

289
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:24,647
They only tell us what we need to know.

290
00:32:24,748 --> 00:32:27,376
My work is a small part
of a larger experiment.

291
00:32:27,484 --> 00:32:29,918
- Whose experiment?
- Trevor's.

292
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:33,713
We're studying
what's growing outside the wall.

293
00:32:34,191 --> 00:32:37,627
Something happened
when they cured the industrial disease.

294
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:40,322
Something else sprung up in its place.

295
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:42,395
We're sick.

296
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:46,496
And Trevor's trying to cure us.
That's all I know.

297
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:52,901
Trevor tried to dope me.

298
00:32:53,243 --> 00:32:54,835
Tell me what's in this.

299
00:33:02,285 --> 00:33:03,775
It's a message.

300
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:05,845
Well, what does it say?

301
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,254
You have to drink it.
That's how it works.

302
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:14,928
I loved her.

303
00:33:18,335 --> 00:33:19,802
You know that.

304
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:41,014
Aeon.

305
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:46,489
I'm sorry for the pain,
but it's not safe to talk in the open.

306
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:49,658
Nothing is as it seems.

307
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:54,935
You had your chance.
Why did you hesitate?

308
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:00,670
You know where to find me.

309
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:33,133
- Why am I here?
- I needed to see you again.

310
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,673
You killed my sister.

311
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:38,247
I didn't know anything about it.

312
00:34:39,082 --> 00:34:40,276
I'm sorry.

313
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:42,577
- And that excuses you?
- No.

314
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:45,617
But this is a war.
People on all sides die.

315
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:49,321
She shouldn't have.
She had nothing to do with this.

316
00:34:50,227 --> 00:34:53,526
- Everyone is involved in this.
- She wasn't.

317
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:59,634
I don't need that to kill you.

318
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,134
But it would be easier, wouldn't it?

319
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:08,509
Everything changed when I saw you.

320
00:35:10,747 --> 00:35:12,874
I know you. And you know me.

321
00:35:15,151 --> 00:35:18,143
Why do I know you? Why?

322
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:22,822
Why did you come back?

323
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,727
- What do you want from me?
- What do I want?

324
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,861
I want my sister back.

325
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:32,330
I want to remember
what it feels like to be a person.

326
00:35:40,143 --> 00:35:41,167
Aeon.

327
00:35:41,811 --> 00:35:44,211
Why do I feel this way around you?

328
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:46,839
Katherine...

329
00:36:48,578 --> 00:36:49,704
You know me.

330
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,677
I want you to eliminate him.

331
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,208
Come back.

332
00:36:56,486 --> 00:36:58,852
I'm not who you think I am, Aeon.

333
00:39:58,768 --> 00:40:00,463
Something is missing here.

334
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:04,740
We identified the variables
that compromised test group 7A.

335
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:08,935
Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B
and make sure we isolate them.

336
00:40:09,045 --> 00:40:10,444
It's just a matter of time...

337
00:40:10,547 --> 00:40:13,744
before people look up
and question what's happening here.

338
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:45,210
Found you.

339
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,366
No permanent damage here, Chairman.

340
00:42:56,245 --> 00:42:57,712
You may leave.

341
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:03,318
She's escaped.

342
00:43:03,853 --> 00:43:05,684
Why am I not surprised?

343
00:43:05,788 --> 00:43:07,722
I found her in the library.

344
00:43:07,824 --> 00:43:10,418
- I think I wounded her, but...
- You attacked her?

345
00:43:10,526 --> 00:43:12,960
She's a Monican agent
who tried to kill you.

346
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:15,053
I assumed it was obvious
what I should do.

347
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:17,962
Freya, I want her alive.
Do you understand?

348
00:43:23,473 --> 00:43:25,304
Is Oren aware of this?

349
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:27,467
I can't find him.

350
00:43:28,244 --> 00:43:29,575
Stay close.

351
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:39,785
No matter what Trevor's done for us
in the past, he's not above reproach.

352
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:41,447
This is treason.

353
00:43:43,326 --> 00:43:44,384
Oren?

354
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,295
Trevor has been moving away from us
for a long time.

355
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,633
What we've built here
is larger than him.

356
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:01,037
I never thought it would come to this,
but we have to face the truth.

357
00:44:02,311 --> 00:44:05,678
He chose that Monican
and he knew what that would mean.

358
00:44:05,782 --> 00:44:07,443
He must be removed.

359
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,609
And Oren is next in line.

360
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:13,079
Isn't that right?

361
00:44:14,824 --> 00:44:15,916
Yes.

362
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,650
It's done, then.

363
00:44:20,463 --> 00:44:21,896
Mr. Chairman.

364
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:26,929
Trevor has betrayed all of us.

365
00:44:29,472 --> 00:44:31,030
He's a criminal.

366
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:34,073
We'll treat him as one.

367
00:44:37,246 --> 00:44:38,975
...test group 7A.

368
00:44:39,082 --> 00:44:43,041
Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B
and make sure we isolate them.

369
00:44:43,152 --> 00:44:44,483
It's just a matter of time...

370
00:44:44,587 --> 00:44:47,750
before people look up
and question what's happening here.

371
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:53,517
Review progress of subjects
from test group 7B...

372
00:44:53,796 --> 00:44:57,254
Sandrin Veems, Greta Salk, Una Flux.

373
00:44:57,567 --> 00:45:00,536
Schedule a Relical visit
to retrieve new data.

374
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,468
8.26, 7.19.

375
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:07,568
Greta Salk, Una Flux.

376
00:45:07,777 --> 00:45:10,746
Schedule a Relical visit
to retrieve new data.

377
00:45:10,847 --> 00:45:13,680
8.26, 7.19.

378
00:45:15,818 --> 00:45:19,914
Collect additional samples
from Relical strands 5.88.

379
00:45:23,926 --> 00:45:26,417
You're certainly killing him kindly.

380
00:45:29,232 --> 00:45:31,257
The situation has changed.

381
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,129
Our orders haven't.

382
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,236
I'm not following orders anymore.

383
00:45:37,206 --> 00:45:39,367
Why are you doing this, Aeon?

384
00:45:40,243 --> 00:45:42,302
Everything has become
more complicated.

385
00:45:42,411 --> 00:45:43,503
No, it's simple.

386
00:45:43,613 --> 00:45:45,706
Trevor may not be responsible
for Una's death.

387
00:45:45,815 --> 00:45:49,148
- Trevor?
- I'm trying to find out who is.

388
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:54,122
Your mission was to kill Goodchild
and you can't or won't do that. So...

389
00:45:57,827 --> 00:46:00,295
Give me your weapon
and return across the frontier.

390
00:46:00,396 --> 00:46:04,628
- Didn't I teach you to think for yourself?
- You taught me a lot more than that.

391
00:46:06,736 --> 00:46:07,930
Please!

392
00:46:08,404 --> 00:46:10,497
I can hurt you if I have to.

393
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,104
Don't you feel something wrong
inside you?

394
00:46:14,277 --> 00:46:15,904
Sithandra, I'm...

395
00:46:19,815 --> 00:46:21,646
I don't know who I am.

396
00:46:24,687 --> 00:46:26,814
You feel it, too, don't you?

397
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:29,724
Come with me.

398
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,260
We'll finish the mission together.

399
00:46:39,135 --> 00:46:40,329
I can't.

400
00:47:57,313 --> 00:47:59,304
This sort of thing used to be fun.

401
00:48:00,216 --> 00:48:02,207
Now what do I do with you?

402
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:44,583
Katherine.

403
00:48:47,763 --> 00:48:49,060
Come back.

404
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:34,897
07.4.872.

405
00:50:35,671 --> 00:50:38,435
Noted. Returned to stream.

406
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:41,365
Gregor Plitzen.

407
00:50:42,778 --> 00:50:47,147
70.5.872.

408
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:50,785
Noted. Returned to stream.

409
00:50:52,054 --> 00:50:53,749
Suki Denali.

410
00:50:54,523 --> 00:50:59,187
02.4.875.

411
00:50:59,562 --> 00:51:02,190
Noted. Returned to stream.

412
00:51:08,938 --> 00:51:10,371
Welcome back.

413
00:51:49,111 --> 00:51:50,373
Una Flux.

414
00:51:51,146 --> 00:51:55,549
32.4.870.

415
00:51:56,285 --> 00:51:57,582
Collected.

416
00:52:00,689 --> 00:52:03,988
Successfully reassigned
as Sasha Prillo.

417
00:52:04,527 --> 00:52:05,687
Repeat.

418
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:11,357
Una Flux. Reassigned as Sasha Prillo.

419
00:52:14,737 --> 00:52:17,069
Sasha Prillo. Address.

420
00:52:17,573 --> 00:52:20,974
Sasha Prillo. Address.

421
00:52:52,508 --> 00:52:53,702
Handler.

422
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:55,106
Sithandra.

423
00:52:55,511 --> 00:52:57,502
Goodchild is still alive.

424
00:52:57,713 --> 00:52:59,112
Aeon failed?

425
00:52:59,748 --> 00:53:01,340
She let him live.

426
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:04,415
There's something between them.

427
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,647
Something personal.

428
00:53:07,122 --> 00:53:08,350
Explain.

429
00:53:08,824 --> 00:53:10,519
She abandoned the mission.

430
00:53:10,626 --> 00:53:14,221
I tried to stop her,
and she attacked me and left me here.

431
00:53:15,864 --> 00:53:18,025
Are you secure where you are?

432
00:53:19,535 --> 00:53:20,695
Fairly.

433
00:53:21,837 --> 00:53:23,327
Help is coming.

434
00:53:23,772 --> 00:53:26,434
Aeon Flux is now considered a fugitive.

435
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:30,904
She has betrayed the resistance
and must be considered a threat.

436
00:53:31,013 --> 00:53:34,574
She has aligned herself with Goodchild
and is with him now.

437
00:53:34,683 --> 00:53:36,446
We must move quickly.

438
00:53:37,686 --> 00:53:39,551
You will eliminate her.

439
00:53:40,189 --> 00:53:42,851
Kill her and then complete her mission.

440
00:53:44,393 --> 00:53:46,861
Sithandra, show them where you are.

441
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:55,334
Do you see?

442
00:53:56,605 --> 00:53:58,436
- Yes.
- Yes.

443
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,598
Yes.

444
00:54:00,609 --> 00:54:03,203
Extricate her and proceed from there.

445
00:54:11,353 --> 00:54:12,513
Trevor?

446
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:27,063
It's her.

447
00:54:27,736 --> 00:54:28,794
Yes.

448
00:54:30,205 --> 00:54:33,038
- She was here.
- What was she looking for?

449
00:54:33,742 --> 00:54:35,073
Her sister.

450
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:38,036
Una.

451
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:54,657
Una Flux.

452
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:58,531
Scroll down.

453
00:54:59,101 --> 00:55:02,229
Member of test group 7B.

454
00:55:02,638 --> 00:55:04,367
Show me all of 7B.

455
00:55:06,542 --> 00:55:08,237
Sandrin Veems.

456
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:11,007
Member of 7B.

457
00:55:11,513 --> 00:55:13,674
Killed in police action.

458
00:55:16,985 --> 00:55:18,179
Where is she?

459
00:55:18,287 --> 00:55:19,652
Greta Salk.

460
00:55:20,155 --> 00:55:22,623
Member of 7B.

461
00:55:23,058 --> 00:55:25,049
Killed in police action.

462
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,023
There's nobody here.

463
00:55:28,464 --> 00:55:30,091
Camille Abdi.

464
00:55:30,632 --> 00:55:32,896
Member of 7B.

465
00:55:33,702 --> 00:55:35,727
Killed in police action.

466
00:55:44,146 --> 00:55:45,408
Una Flux.

467
00:55:45,848 --> 00:55:48,043
Member of 7B.

468
00:55:49,151 --> 00:55:51,312
Killed in police action.

469
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:07,167
Who did this?

470
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:11,797
All actions authorized
by Adjunct Chairman Oren Goodchild.

471
00:56:13,842 --> 00:56:17,369
Freya, go to my lab,
find the notes from group 7B.

472
00:56:17,479 --> 00:56:20,312
You need to get to a safe place.
They're moving against you.

473
00:56:20,415 --> 00:56:22,849
- Meet me there in two hours.
- Where are you going?

474
00:56:22,951 --> 00:56:25,419
- I have to find her before they do.
- Trevor...

475
00:56:25,521 --> 00:56:27,785
Freya, I'll see you at the lab.

476
00:56:28,624 --> 00:56:30,455
Take care of yourself.

477
00:56:39,434 --> 00:56:40,560
Una.

478
00:56:41,737 --> 00:56:43,170
You're right.

479
00:56:47,075 --> 00:56:49,737
- Please don't hurt my baby.
- She's safe.

480
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,504
You cloned her?

481
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:56,078
I cloned everybody.

482
00:56:58,453 --> 00:57:02,287
There was a complication
when we cured the industrial disease.

483
00:57:03,992 --> 00:57:06,756
The vaccine had
an unintended side effect.

484
00:57:08,797 --> 00:57:10,094
Sterility.

485
00:57:10,899 --> 00:57:14,300
Only one more generation
of our species could survive.

486
00:57:15,304 --> 00:57:16,794
It was a desperate time.

487
00:57:16,905 --> 00:57:18,270
It's our responsibility...

488
00:57:18,373 --> 00:57:21,900
Cloning had never been used
on humans successfully.

489
00:57:26,515 --> 00:57:28,107
But we succeeded.

490
00:57:30,485 --> 00:57:34,478
Now, when a person dies,
their DNA is recycled.

491
00:57:34,623 --> 00:57:37,615
Oren and I built the Relical
to store the DNA...

492
00:57:37,726 --> 00:57:39,694
and conceal the cloning process.

493
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,791
The Keeper finds a suitable couple...

494
00:57:43,398 --> 00:57:46,993
and, using food additives,
we induce a chemical pregnancy.

495
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:52,729
When the woman comes in for an exam,
we implant a cloned embryo.

496
00:57:53,141 --> 00:57:55,268
From there, things happen naturally.

497
00:57:55,811 --> 00:57:59,611
In nine months,
a citizen who died is reborn.

498
00:58:02,017 --> 00:58:05,453
For seven generations,
Oren and I have cloned ourselves...

499
00:58:05,554 --> 00:58:09,388
taught ourselves, so that
I could keep trying to find a cure...

500
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,157
while we all live on.

501
00:58:18,066 --> 00:58:19,795
That's what we are?

502
00:58:21,003 --> 00:58:22,163
Copies?

503
00:58:23,372 --> 00:58:25,135
We're more than that.

504
00:58:29,177 --> 00:58:31,645
It wasn't supposed to be permanent.

505
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,448
I've been trying to cure the infertility.

506
00:58:40,756 --> 00:58:43,350
Una was part of one of my test groups.

507
00:58:44,026 --> 00:58:45,584
Oren lied to me.

508
00:58:45,894 --> 00:58:48,920
He told me her test had failed
like the others.

509
00:58:49,665 --> 00:58:51,758
But she had become pregnant.

510
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:57,368
He killed all of the subjects.

511
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,003
Your sister included.

512
00:59:02,678 --> 00:59:05,306
He killed her
because she was pregnant.

513
00:59:10,385 --> 00:59:12,080
Una didn't know it...

514
00:59:12,688 --> 00:59:16,920
but her baby would've been one
of the first new children in 400 years.

515
00:59:19,094 --> 00:59:20,584
Oren's changed.

516
00:59:22,164 --> 00:59:25,395
He doesn't want to go back.
He doesn't want a cure.

517
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,303
He wants to live forever.

518
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:41,404
You must've been expecting this
after helping that Monican.

519
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:47,042
Your loyalty to Trevor
can't protect you anymore.

520
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:50,210
I'm loyal to something deeper
than any of this.

521
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:53,883
I don't understand
people like you and Trevor.

522
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:57,119
Your sentimentality,
your devotion to the past...

523
00:59:58,128 --> 00:59:59,789
to things that are gone.

524
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:02,457
I couldn't live without those things.

525
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,565
How can you?

526
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:23,912
Sasha.

527
01:00:25,422 --> 01:00:28,755
We should go.
It won't take long for Oren to find us.

528
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:35,065
She's gonna be a handful.

529
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,526
Go. They don't want you.

530
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,661
Go!

531
01:03:39,716 --> 01:03:40,842
Down!

532
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,564
No. You need to stay conscious.

533
01:04:08,812 --> 01:04:10,439
Please remain calm.

534
01:04:11,415 --> 01:04:14,213
We are experiencing
a technical malfunction.

535
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:18,716
Please remain calm.

536
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:22,491
We are experiencing
a technical malfunction.

537
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,892
Please remain calm.

538
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,464
We are experiencing...

539
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:42,668
We can't go to a Monican safe house.

540
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,143
Nowhere's going to be safe for us.

541
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,328
We need to get the bullets out.

542
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:42,695
Are you hit anywhere else?

543
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:50,402
Did any of them manage to miss you?

544
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,460
We might have to go outside the wall.

545
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:14,864
I know.

546
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:19,732
First, I have to end this.

547
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,377
I need to go back in.

548
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:28,550
I have to get my notes
from Una's test group.

549
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:33,519
Oren will find the lab and destroy it,
everything I've done.

550
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:51,797
All military units should report
to their stations...

551
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:54,001
and wait for further instructions.

552
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:03,181
Who's in charge here?

553
01:07:04,588 --> 01:07:05,953
We need your help.

554
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:08,581
- We have orders to shoot you on sight.
- There's been a coup.

555
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:11,456
Your orders are coming
from an illegitimate government.

556
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:14,428
- Stay where you are, sir!
- What's your name?

557
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:17,128
- Sir?
- I want to know your name.

558
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:21,229
It's Ord. Garret Ord.

559
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:25,367
I can't command you anymore, Garret.
But neither can they.

560
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:27,375
You're free.

561
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:30,305
You need to make a decision.

562
01:07:33,784 --> 01:07:36,480
Shoot us or help us, but do it quickly.

563
01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:39,252
Lieutenant?

564
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:50,291
How can I help you,
Chairman Goodchild?

565
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:56,434
We need weapons.
We need to get back into the Citadel.

566
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:57,768
Yes, sir.

567
01:08:07,884 --> 01:08:11,843
Attention. Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions.

568
01:08:11,955 --> 01:08:13,650
You will be updated frequently.

569
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:17,784
This is an announcement from the
Council and Chairman Oren Goodchild.

570
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:24,060
Attention. Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions.

571
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:30,164
- We're getting closer.
- Wait.

572
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,388
Trevor.

573
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,721
The name you called me...

574
01:08:58,635 --> 01:08:59,932
Katherine.

575
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:02,796
That was my name.

576
01:09:06,376 --> 01:09:07,968
You were my wife.

577
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:15,575
We had a life together,
just like anybody else.

578
01:09:16,052 --> 01:09:17,110
Wait.

579
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:20,150
You need to tell me.

580
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:26,261
I lost you during the disease,
and you couldn't be brought back.

581
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:29,924
I've lived and died
seven times since then.

582
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:34,363
And each time
I taught myself about you.

583
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,366
You were an idea I kept alive.

584
01:09:37,874 --> 01:09:39,933
Something I had to imagine.

585
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:46,911
But when I saw you...

586
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:51,583
what I felt was real.

587
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:53,854
I knew you.

588
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:57,284
I remembered you.

589
01:09:57,827 --> 01:10:01,763
What we had then survived in us
past death, past everything.

590
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,865
I was looking for you.

591
01:10:07,137 --> 01:10:08,764
I've been waiting.

592
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:12,375
We were different people.

593
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,403
We were.

594
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,940
Those people are gone.

595
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:21,046
But something in them came back.

596
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:23,343
Yes.

597
01:10:39,169 --> 01:10:40,500
I remember.

598
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:44,836
It's chaos out there.

599
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:46,909
There's a coup against Goodchild.

600
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:49,001
Made it easier to slip in.

601
01:10:49,179 --> 01:10:50,612
Did you bring a way to find her?

602
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:53,774
As long as there's a trace of the pill
in her, we can track her.

603
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:05,251
No.

604
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:25,307
Freya.

605
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:32,818
It's gone.

606
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:36,582
I had cured it.

607
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:38,726
I'd found the answer.

608
01:11:39,229 --> 01:11:40,696
It's all gone.

609
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,565
We have to keep moving.

610
01:11:54,544 --> 01:11:57,012
There's still one more thing to do.

611
01:11:57,547 --> 01:12:01,347
There's nothing left to do.
You and I need to get out of here.

612
01:12:02,352 --> 01:12:05,583
We go outside the wall.
We'll find a way to live.

613
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:09,215
There's one more thing to do.
I need to destroy it.

614
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:11,015
No.

615
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,291
This isn't the answer, Aeon.

616
01:12:15,398 --> 01:12:17,764
There's no guarantee
I can find the cure again.

617
01:12:17,867 --> 01:12:20,859
- The cloning is all we have.
- It's not enough.

618
01:12:21,438 --> 01:12:25,101
Our minds are unraveling, and every
time you bring us back it gets worse.

619
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,108
If you do this, we end.

620
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,339
We're meant to die.

621
01:12:30,914 --> 01:12:33,644
It's what makes
anything about us matter.

622
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:37,978
Living like this is torture.

623
01:12:38,088 --> 01:12:39,749
We're just ghosts.

624
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:43,385
That's not how I feel.

625
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:46,754
Not now.

626
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,463
Let's be careful.

627
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:59,170
You know who we're up against.

628
01:13:05,582 --> 01:13:08,608
- This is an empty gesture.
- It's a leap of faith.

629
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,777
It's not for you to decide.

630
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:15,246
Aeon, I don't want to lose you again.

631
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:18,354
You don't have to.

632
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:21,655
You'll find the cure again.

633
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:24,693
It's over, Trevor.

634
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,933
Moving into position on the south spire.

635
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:40,341
It goes so much deeper than your cure.

636
01:13:40,884 --> 01:13:43,546
Other women have been
getting pregnant naturally...

637
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:45,746
outside of your experiments.

638
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:47,786
More and more of them.

639
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:50,790
They healed themselves.

640
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,695
- And you killed them, too?
- I had to stop it.

641
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:56,895
How many?

642
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:02,565
How many, Oren?

643
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:06,571
It doesn't matter.
Nature's finally found a way.

644
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:11,642
- In position.
- In position.

645
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:13,079
Position acquired.

646
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:16,384
Nature's the one who's obsolete, not us.

647
01:14:17,654 --> 01:14:21,852
How can you not understand
the beauty of what you made? I do.

648
01:14:23,193 --> 01:14:24,854
Situation's getting complicated.

649
01:14:31,668 --> 01:14:33,795
You told me she was gone.

650
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:40,105
There was nothing that they could do.

651
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,907
I ordered her DNA destroyed.

652
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,883
You were a different man
with her, Trevor.

653
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:53,183
She would've stopped you
from doing what needed to be done.

654
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,190
- Like she's stopping you now.
- No, Oren.

655
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:57,316
Yes.

656
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,525
- Waiting for the go.
- On my signal.

657
01:14:59,629 --> 01:15:01,859
This world, our world, is beautiful.

658
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,591
Worth preserving at any cost.

659
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:07,134
It can't last. It's falling apart.

660
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,940
Sithandra, give us the signal.

661
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:17,277
- Sithandra.
- Take Flux down first.

662
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,472
You're wrong in this, Oren.

663
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,981
We've beaten death, beaten nature.

664
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:23,846
We've gone beyond you.

665
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,545
And now I need to be free of you.

666
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:37,857
Wait.

667
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,211
Sithandra.

668
01:15:56,486 --> 01:15:59,250
You chose this, Aeon. It's too late.

669
01:15:59,622 --> 01:16:01,647
You know how much we're all suffering.

670
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:04,124
I'm trying to end it, and so is Trevor.

671
01:16:04,761 --> 01:16:06,695
I would never betray you.

672
01:16:07,297 --> 01:16:08,491
Help me.

673
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:11,998
Sithandra.

674
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:14,830
You still know me.

675
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:16,268
Finish it.

676
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:19,232
You can choose to trust me.

677
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,069
Finish it.

678
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:26,773
I'm sorry, Oren.

679
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:28,074
I'm sorry.

680
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:29,310
I am, too.

681
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:37,487
Orders have changed.
Cover Aeon. Cover Goodchild.

682
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:21,366
Goodchild's been hit.

683
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:27,603
Flux is headed to the courtyard.

684
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:32,778
Cover Aeon.

685
01:18:56,599 --> 01:18:57,930
Sithandra!

686
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:50,277
Oren.

687
01:20:24,086 --> 01:20:25,576
They're coming.

688
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:31,920
Aeon.

689
01:20:51,981 --> 01:20:54,176
We're waiting for your orders.

690
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:56,618
You're not part of this?

691
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,214
Whatever we are, we're not anarchists.

692
01:21:00,623 --> 01:21:03,114
- There have to be rules.
- Thank you.

693
01:21:35,191 --> 01:21:36,715
You're the one.

694
01:21:37,493 --> 01:21:38,926
You saved me.

695
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:40,552
Yes.

696
01:21:41,764 --> 01:21:43,322
I knew you then.

697
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:46,327
This one was corrupted. Destroy it.

698
01:21:46,869 --> 01:21:48,860
I knew you were important.

699
01:21:49,538 --> 01:21:51,096
The DNA is good.

700
01:21:51,207 --> 01:21:52,538
Destroy it.

701
01:21:58,481 --> 01:22:01,006
I knew that I needed to protect you.

702
01:22:02,818 --> 01:22:06,914
I kept your DNA hidden here, dormant.

703
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:10,252
I've waited until now to bring you back.

704
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:11,617
Why?

705
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:16,796
I knew that your strength
would survive with you.

706
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:20,966
I thought that if I brought you back,
you could reach Trevor.

707
01:22:22,405 --> 01:22:24,032
You always could.

708
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:28,276
- I have to end it.
- Yes.

709
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:30,640
Start over.

710
01:22:31,514 --> 01:22:33,038
What about you?

711
01:22:34,984 --> 01:22:38,181
I've waited 400 years for this day.

712
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,088
I'm tired.

713
01:22:50,599 --> 01:22:52,191
Stay alive, Aeon.

714
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,894
You are needed.

715
01:23:48,124 --> 01:23:49,352
Look!

716
01:24:56,926 --> 01:24:58,917
Now we can move forward...

717
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:03,531
to live once for real...

718
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:10,200
and then give way to people
who might do it better.

719
01:25:17,913 --> 01:25:19,642
Hey, Katherine.

720
01:25:23,419 --> 01:25:25,216
Will I see you again?

721
01:25:35,931 --> 01:25:37,660
To live only once...

722
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:44,462
but with hope.
