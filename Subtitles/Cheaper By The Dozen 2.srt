2
00:00:52,184 --> 00:00:55,730
They say that starting a family
is an act of optimism.

3
00:00:55,813 --> 00:01:00,860
Well, Tom and I were clearly
very, very, very optimistic.

4
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:04,321
There are always good times
and difficult ones along the way.

5
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:07,825
And with 12 kids, you learn a lot of lessons.

6
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:12,913
But the one that you never get used to is that
moment when you look your child in the eye

7
00:01:12,997 --> 00:01:18,794
and find yourself having to say
the most difficult word of all: Goodbye.

8
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,672
All right, stay together.

9
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:40,024
There she is.

10
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:42,276
Sergio Archer.

11
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,447
Look, she's right there.

12
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,493
Robert Armstrong.

13
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:54,205
Peter Bailey.

14
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,962
Lorraine Baker.

15
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:27,988
- He's really gotten good.
- Yeah.

16
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,619
My gosh. Kicking, kicking.

17
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,351
All right, all right.
It is time to toast the graduate.

18
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:04,650
Lorraine,

19
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:06,986
we are all so proud of you,

20
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:10,823
for keeping your chin up
and charging the mountain.

21
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:19,331
And for being a truly unique
and wonderful person.

22
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:24,795
<i>And for getting that internship at Allure
magazine. Did you know about that?</i>

23
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:31,052
Even though I'll be trying to convince you
staying here is a better choice for your future

24
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:37,099
than moving to dirty, expensive, crime-ridden
New York City, but here's to Lorraine.

25
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:42,396
OK. My daughter Nora and her husband Bud,
you wanna say something?

26
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,233
And our future linebacker.
We go. Let's go.

27
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,573
First of all, congratulations, Lorraine.

28
00:03:52,656 --> 00:03:56,202
Bud and I hope that our baby
will be as cool and accomplished as you.

29
00:03:56,285 --> 00:04:01,248
And second of all, I don't mean
to make this toast all about Bud and I,

30
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:05,586
- but we have some kind of big news.
- You know about this?

31
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:10,883
I've just been offered the vice-presidency
of a new advertising firm.

32
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:14,053
Hey! Congratulations. Yeah!

33
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,639
In Houston.

34
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:23,270
We're moving in September. Thank you.

35
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:25,439
Great. Wow.

36
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:33,114
- Does this mean we won't be uncles?
- You'll be uncles no matter where we live.

37
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:36,158
Maybe they thought
it was the best way to break it to us.

38
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,870
- Quite a surprise.
- I'll say. Can I get a beer and a white wine?

39
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:42,123
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

40
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:45,876
- I feel like I'm losing two daughters now.
- You're not losing us.

41
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,964
I hope you have help, cos with no family
there and you being a first-time mom...

42
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,759
- You'll be at work all day...
- I'm not gonna be at work all the time.

43
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:58,347
We're gonna be fine. And whatever house
we get is gonna have a room reserved for you.

44
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,517
At least you're gonna stay
for the touch football game.

45
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,021
- We can't. We have Lamaze.
- This will help your breathing.

46
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,897
We're gonna see you soon.

47
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:09,817
You're driving, right?

48
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,154
- See you.
- Bye, sweetheart. There you go, sir.

49
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:15,197
That's...

50
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,366
They seem so casual and cavalier.

51
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,494
Well, time for me to get my hands dirty.

52
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:24,331
You're working? What about the game?
Rematch against the cousins.

53
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:27,168
I've got student loans to pay off, Dad.

54
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:31,422
- OK. See you.
- Be safe, honey.

55
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:34,925
Did everybody forget touch football
was a tradition here?

56
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,554
- Honey, you've got ten other kids to draft.
- I forgot.

57
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:40,264
- You forgot?
- Lorraine.

58
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:43,934
- Staying for the game?
- No, didn't Mom tell you?

59
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:47,688
I'm spending the weekend at Beth's.
I leave in five minutes. Love you.

60
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:50,483
Bye. Hey, guys. Ready for some touch?

61
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:56,113
- Mike and I are competing at the skate park.
- I volunteered at the animal shelter.

62
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,244
Nigel, Kyle, football.

63
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:04,872
All right.

64
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:12,838
- I'm here, Coach.
- You just made the varsity, little lady.

65
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,633
Come on. There you go.
Go, go, go!

66
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:18,344
- I'll block for you. Here we go. Go!
- Athletes!

67
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,556
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

68
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,185
Somehow I thought it'd get easier.

69
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:31,440
Ten minutes ago, they were all over us. Now
they don't want to be seen with us in public.

70
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,695
- What's that doing here?
- I bet Lorraine was looking through this.

71
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:37,863
That's sweet.

72
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:43,160
The cutest. Look at her.

73
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:45,913
She looks just like my mom.

74
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:48,040
A lot of memories.

75
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:50,418
Summers in Wisconsin.

76
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:54,880
Swimming. All of us camping out.
Everyone together. Isn't that sweet?

77
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:59,010
That had to be the last time we were there.
What was it? Three or four years ago?

78
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:03,431
- Look at Sarah. No teeth.
- We were one tight unit back then.

79
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:06,600
Even if we never beat the Murtaughs
for the Labor Day Cup.

80
00:07:06,684 --> 00:07:10,146
Look at that.
Jimmy Murtaugh - Mr Competitive.

81
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,358
He was so desperate to win,
he would... he would win.

82
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:17,737
All the time.
Even when we were kids, this guy was...

83
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,032
All right, honey. Let's not go there.

84
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:26,245
You know what?
That's exactly what we should do.

85
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:29,832
Go back to the lake. The whole family
on vacation, like we used to.

86
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:33,044
I could call Mike Romanow
and see if the house is available.

87
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:37,089
It's a great idea, but the kids
are in summer school and Nora's pregnant.

88
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:41,427
That's exactly why we should do it, Kate.
We said it. Life's blazing by.

89
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,847
Let's go back to the lake one last time.

90
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,225
We did have such good times there, honey.

91
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:52,063
You and I had alone time, which was nice.

92
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:54,231
There's the proof.

93
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:58,527
- Hey, Gunner.
- Hey, Gunner.

94
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,530
Let's call Mike Romanow, honey.

95
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,745
You're conferencing
with all of us and Lorraine.

96
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:10,831
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, guys. What's up?

97
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:13,209
- It's Lorraine.
- We have a surprise.

98
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,711
We rented the big house up in Lake Winnetka.

99
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,798
- Winnetka? That's my middle name.
- And Lake is mine.

100
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:23,552
And it's where we're gonna spend Labor Day,
just like in the old days.

101
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,180
Dad, I'm gonna be very pregnant then.

102
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:29,600
And I'm gonna be apartment hunting
in New York in August.

103
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:34,105
- I wanna hang out with my friends.
- How come we're named after a house?

104
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:38,150
Good question. Your middle name is
Winnetka and your middle name is Lake

105
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:41,362
- cos you were conceived there.
- What does "conceived" mean?

106
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:46,242
- It means Mom and Dad...
- Had a conversation that we'd discuss it later.

107
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,412
Kyle and me will go anyplace
that has our name on it.

108
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,164
- Bingo! Come on.
- Yeah. I love the lake. I'm in.

109
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:55,376
- I guess I can cancel a couple of gigs.
- Bingo!

110
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:56,919
- OK, we're in.
- All right.

111
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:59,088
We agree to participate.

112
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,882
We'll bring the wakeboards
and totally dominate.

113
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:06,262
- OK, we're in.
- All right! And that leaves Lorraine.

114
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:10,016
- Come on. You'll have fun.
- Come on, Lorraine. Just come.

115
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,893
All right, here's the deal. I'll go to the lake

116
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:15,896
if Dad stops nagging me
about not going to New York.

117
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,607
Deal. That's a dozen. We're going to the lake.

118
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:46,010
- Who cut the cheese?
- Gunner farted.

119
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:49,889
We'll drive up tomorrow
or the next day.

120
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:53,184
- You missed.
- I love you too. Bye.

121
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:57,313
Lorraine's got a line on a place.
She and Charlie will come in a couple of days.

122
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:01,984
Couple of days? The whole point of the
vacation is that the whole family is together.

123
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,153
Honey, relax.

124
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:10,117
All right. Remember this?
Look at the lake. It looks fantastic.

125
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:13,162
- Does it look great or what?
- Come on, kids.

126
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,956
All right. Slide out. Hurry up.

127
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,128
Everyone out. Come on.
Let's check the place out.

128
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:23,339
- Look at it.
- This is it?

129
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,634
- Remember this?
- It looks smaller.

130
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:30,346
- And more disgusting.
- Yeah. Why can't we rent that place?

131
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,391
Well, that place is new.

132
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:37,728
- This place is...
- Older, but still nice.

133
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:43,818
Yeah. And that might have a water slide,
but our place has...

134
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:46,112
There's stairs. They're fun.

135
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:50,157
So unload, camper dudes! Girls in
the north bunk room, boys in the south.

136
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:52,743
- Bud and Nora in the loft. Come on!
- Careful.

137
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:56,038
Hey, Bud, give the phone a rest.
We're on vacation.

138
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,541
Hey. How did Mad Dog like the trip?

139
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,293
Maybe the baby's
not gonna be a "Mad Dog", Tom.

140
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:05,756
But that's a classic linebacker name.
OK, how about Dick Butkus McNulty?

141
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,677
- Maybe it's gonna be a girl, Dad.
- Donna Butkus McNulty.

142
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,097
- We got all vacation to pick a name.
- Someone's here.

143
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,975
- Mike Romanow. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

144
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:19,979
Everything OK? Shouldn't be too
disorganised, only two renters this season.

145
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:23,691
- The lake's a lot more upscale.
- Thank Jimmy Murtaugh. Remember him?

146
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:26,027
- Yeah.
- He owns most of the lake now.

147
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,279
That's his place over there.

148
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,823
Well, good for Jimmy.

149
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:35,202
- Hey, remember Kate?
- Hey, Mike. How are you?

150
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:37,038
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

151
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:40,583
If you don't feel like cooking,
there's a clambake up at the club.

152
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,793
- You can come as my guests.
- Guests?

153
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:46,589
Yeah. Club's private now.
And renovated.

154
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:50,176
- Homeowners only. Put you on the list?
- OK.

155
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,599
- What's going on?
- Stop!

156
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:00,353
The Chiseller.

157
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:03,773
- Tell me those aren't my keys.
- Get him outside, OK?

158
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:08,277
- I remember how to handle this guy.
- I can't believe he's still alive.

159
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,489
- You know that thing?
- Hey.

160
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:14,533
- Don't hurt him.
- I got it. I got it.

161
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:18,621
It's a snap. Here you go. Hold still. Yeah.

162
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,838
Leave him alone!

163
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:30,424
Gunner! Stay! Stay, Gunner!

164
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:33,135
- Get him.
- Gunner, stay!

165
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,889
Mom, watch out!

166
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:46,899
Don't light the fireworks.

167
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:52,321
- No explosives in the house!
- Nigel! Kyle!

168
00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:00,454
Gunner, come back.

169
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:08,462
- What was that beast?
- The Chiseller?

170
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:10,756
A pack rat. Steals stuff and hides it.

171
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,843
- I'll get a trap in the morning.
- A humane trap, right?

172
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,637
You know what?
We got a fantastic first day going.

173
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:22,727
So let's clean up and unpack,
cos we got a clambake to go to! Clambake!

174
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,981
- OK, here we go. What is all this stuff?
- I'm going as fast as I can.

175
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:29,984
I should put more sugar in your diets,
get you moving.

176
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:32,111
You actually bought that shirt?

177
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:38,325
Every dad is entitled to one hideous shirt and
one horrible sweater. It's part of the dad code.

178
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:42,329
- Mark, you're on fireworks detail.
- OK.

179
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:45,458
- What's all that?
- Nothing.

180
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,043
Seatbelts.

181
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,339
OK, kids. You know the rules.

182
00:13:54,258 --> 00:13:58,637
I'm underdressed. I thought this
was supposed to be a clambake.

183
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:01,015
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

184
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:04,143
- Hey, guys. So glad you could come.
- Hi, Mike.

185
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:07,396
Good to see you.
Listen. Kids, food's downstairs.

186
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,024
Mom, Dad, the bar is there.
Have a great time.

187
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:13,027
- Best behaviour.
- Stick together. Keep an eye on them.

188
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,196
- Food.
- See you later.

189
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,914
- Lloyd, how are you?
- Good to see you, Jimmy.

190
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,750
There's Jimmy Murtaugh!
Engage me in conversation.

191
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:32,880
- We are talking.
- I know, but more intense so he won't come.

192
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:39,095
- Just hide your face.
- Well, that's a little obvious.

193
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,138
- Tom!
- Turn.

194
00:14:41,222 --> 00:14:46,143
My goodness.
Look what the wind blew in.

195
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:48,354
- Hey!
- Jimmy!

196
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:52,692
- Tom. Look at you.
- How are you?

197
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:58,906
Wow, you're looking good. A little wrinkled
around the edges, but not bad for an old man.

198
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:01,659
- And you.
- Kate.

199
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:06,497
Kate. Still looking very hot for a mother of 12.

200
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,376
- What brings you guys back to my lake?
- Your lake? Your lake now?

201
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:15,089
Well, you know, I just have to buy Romanow's
place and one or two other properties.

202
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:19,677
And then I can keep
the riff-raff like you outta here.

203
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:24,557
I'm sorry, honey.
Tom and Kate, this is Sarina, my new bride.

204
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,101
- Nice to meet you, Sarina.
- Nice to meet you.

205
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:30,438
The parents of that family of pranksters
I told you about.

206
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:35,317
Jimmy's always been jealous cos we have 12
kids and he only has eight. A manhood thing.

207
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:39,989
Well, your 12 never beat my eight
for the cup, now, did they, Tom?

208
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,867
- Well, no, they didn't.
- Is that why you came back?

209
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:48,372
- Trying to knock my family off the wall?
- No. We actually just came for a vacation.

210
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:51,834
- Come on. Buy me a drink.
- Buy you a drink? Mr Lake?

211
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,798
Jake Baker? Eliot Murtaugh.

212
00:15:57,882 --> 00:16:00,551
No way. Dude, it's Eliot Murtaugh.

213
00:16:02,803 --> 00:16:04,930
- That's Mike.
- Hey, Mike.

214
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,850
That's such a cool stick.
Can you bang any tricks?

215
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,436
Yeah. Check it.

216
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:14,732
Awesome!

217
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,740
- I'll have clams, please.
- Sorry, there's no clams.

218
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:25,284
We have some clam fritters.

219
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:29,413
So this clambake is clamless?
Then why not just call it a buffet?

220
00:16:29,497 --> 00:16:34,001
- I feel like a stranger on this planet.
- I couldn't agree with you more.

221
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:40,675
So, Tom, I read you quit the head coaching
gig at Illinois Poly. What was that all about?

222
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:44,387
It took up a lot of hours and I wanted
to spend more time with the family.

223
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,347
- Kudos.
- Thank you.

224
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,809
- That's my word for the day.
- How fun. It's fun to have a word.

225
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:55,147
So, Katie, I guess with Tom at home changing
diapers, you're tearing up the bestseller list.

226
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:57,900
I only had the one book,
but I would love to...

227
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:02,822
<i>Excuse me. Waiter.
Another Scotch, por favor. Anybody else?</i>

228
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:06,075
- I'm fine.
- Hey, what about Charlie? Still playing ball?

229
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,370
No. He's living downtown
and he's working in a garage

230
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:11,914
to pay tuition
to the University of Chicago.

231
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:15,584
<i>I did a guest spot on Monster Garage
back when I was acting.</i>

232
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:19,213
And I just love
the whole engine-and-cars thing.

233
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:22,466
- So you're an actress. That's great.
- Thank you, Tom.

234
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,511
- You're welcome, Sarina.
- Kudos.

235
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:32,393
- How long have you two been married?
- Six amazing months.

236
00:17:32,476 --> 00:17:35,521
- Right, honey?
- Happy anniversary.

237
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:40,067
There's Mike, Jake and Sarah. They compete
in skating contests on a regular basis.

238
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:43,195
- See you.
- Hey! Sarah!

239
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,826
That's good. You gotta start with
the small steps before you take the big ones.

240
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:52,580
- Mark Baker?
- Kenny the maniac!

241
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:55,166
Well, if it isn't my partner in crime.

242
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:59,170
- You're gonna get in trouble, Murtaugh.
- Only if I get caught, Baker.

243
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:02,340
Come here. I wanna show you something.

244
00:18:02,423 --> 00:18:06,635
- Please don't get me in trouble like last time.
- You worry too much.

245
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,262
How are your kids?

246
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:12,141
I've got three at a private school
for gifted children in Lake Forest.

247
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,352
Two at Andover, one at Exeter.

248
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:20,107
Calvin's at Yale finishing up a field study in
particle physics. Generating a lot of interest.

249
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:24,487
<i>Eliot was in Sports Illustrated.
Just won the snowboarding junior nationals.</i>

250
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,490
- Slope style.
- Well, that was no surprise.

251
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,242
But I gotta say, Anne's still my superstar.

252
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:35,289
When she finishes her MBA at Harvard, she's
gonna work for me at Murtaugh Enterprises.

253
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:37,375
Definitely corporate material.

254
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:43,547
Something reeks.

255
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:59,814
Get out of the way!

256
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:06,612
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

257
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,829
Look out. She's gonna blow!

258
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:39,687
Cool.

259
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,607
Listen, mister, accident or not,
you'll be taking the garbage out,

260
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:45,985
or something you don't wanna do,
for 30 days.

261
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:49,697
So sit down, please. Everyone, quiet. For me.

262
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,910
Parenting comes down to one word - "push".
If you don't push, they don't do anything.

263
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:59,623
- I think it's a little more complicated.
- Is it?

264
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:04,628
"Most went through periods in their life when
they worried about making car payments."

265
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:07,548
- Hey! Gotcha!
- Yeah.

266
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:10,551
Nigel, leave Kyle's pants alone!

267
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:14,347
Look, no one was hurt. It's fine.

268
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,641
In fact, why don't you come over
to The Boulders sometime?

269
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:19,935
- The Boulders?
- Our cottage.

270
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,146
We would love to do that sometime...

271
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:26,984
Hey, kids, why don't you leave the fireworks
at home? You're all welcome at our place.

272
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:30,196
We've got Seadoos, lasers, wireless internet,

273
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,076
plasma screens, satellite TVs,
all the toys and whistles.

274
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:38,746
You know what? Actually, we're here
for quality time with the kids.

275
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:42,041
Come on, it's time to go.
We've done enough damage here.

276
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:45,753
- So we'll probably see you on the lake.
- Sure. Another time.

277
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:49,006
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you too.

278
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,551
Good seeing you again, Tom.
You too...

279
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:54,720
- Kate.
- Kate.

280
00:20:57,264 --> 00:21:01,811
Boy, you know, when we were kids,
I used to be so envious of Tom Baker.

281
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,188
He just had it all.

282
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:10,111
Well, I guess the Gucci loafer's
on the other foot now, isn't it?

283
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:13,989
- Everyone, straight to bed.
- What a moron.

284
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,367
- He's our son.
- Not Mark, he's a kid.

285
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,370
Murtaugh. "Seems like you
could use the word 'push'."

286
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:22,164
Next time we see him,
let's agree to ignore him.

287
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:26,460
- There's not gonna be a next time.
- I don't know if the kids will agree.

288
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:30,715
You think that water slide could compete
with the tyre swing I'm gonna put up?

289
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:33,926
Rise and shine! Daylight's burning.

290
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,470
It is breakfast at the Bakers', day one!

291
00:21:36,554 --> 00:21:39,056
Come on, sleepy heads.

292
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,394
Is there a particular reason
that we're eating breakfast outside?

293
00:21:43,477 --> 00:21:48,691
- Cos it's a beautiful day at Lake Winnetka.
- It's vacation, sweetheart.

294
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:54,321
And there's the rest of the clan. Come on.
Hey, guys. Hey, guys, look.

295
00:21:54,405 --> 00:21:57,241
Hey! Welcome to the land o' plenty.

296
00:21:57,324 --> 00:22:04,081
It still smells the same here. Like dead leaves,
unwashed animals and murky lake water.

297
00:22:04,165 --> 00:22:07,043
- It's called fresh air, sweetheart.
- Watch the hat.

298
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,961
- Hey, guys.
- Come on, let's eat.

299
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:12,673
We're gonna need a forklift
to get Lorraine's suitcase outta here.

300
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:16,510
What have I been here, 30 seconds,
and you're already making fun of me?

301
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:19,096
Yeah, that was my foot.

302
00:22:20,014 --> 00:22:23,768
- Is that suitcase just for make-up?
- Whatever, Butch.

303
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:27,897
Big breakfast, everybody, so you
have enough room for family activities.

304
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,401
- Family activities?
- Appleschmear. Fishing for Big Daddy.

305
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,737
The tyre swing, the diving board.

306
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,281
- I'm boarding.
- Kenneth has video games.

307
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:42,161
We were gonna use the Murtaughs' internet
to research for the academic decathlon.

308
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:44,538
Precisely. We need the extra hours.

309
00:22:44,622 --> 00:22:47,500
Well, you got all vacation
to go over to that place.

310
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,753
We have all vacation
to do the family activities too.

311
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,673
Sarah, what about you?
You wanna hang out with Dad?

312
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:57,593
Actually, I was gonna go boarding with Jake.

313
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:00,304
And Eliot.

314
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,558
Well, you know, I guess
we could do lake stuff another day.

315
00:23:04,642 --> 00:23:07,436
Here we go. Scones.

316
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,941
Henry. Jake.
All right. Leave it there, the dog will get it.

317
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,563
Did you nail down an apartment?

318
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,857
I'm just waiting to hear.

319
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,736
I'll bet you could
get a place in Chicago for half the rent.

320
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:59,321
Dad, I thought we made a deal.

321
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,658
That dock needs work.

322
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:17,631
- Where are you going?
- The hardware store. I'll fix this place up.

323
00:24:17,715 --> 00:24:20,426
- You got a crazy look. What are you getting?
- Tools!

324
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,163
Honey.

325
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:51,957
Honey.

326
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,585
OK. Do not stand up. Do you hear me?

327
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:57,380
Dad! Dad! Hello?

328
00:24:58,756 --> 00:25:00,633
Dad!

329
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:06,222
Hey, kids. Tyre swing ready!

330
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:12,144
Tyre swing not ready.

331
00:25:50,808 --> 00:25:53,769
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey. Get bored over at the Murtaughs'

332
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:56,188
No. We're going back after study time.

333
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:59,817
You guys are making time for your studies?
I'm really proud of you.

334
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,736
Not us, Dad. Them.

335
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:05,906
Mr Murtaugh forces all of the kids
to read and write two hours every day.

336
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,492
Lame. I know.

337
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,247
Who are these guys?

338
00:26:14,248 --> 00:26:16,876
- What?
- There's no way I'm camping out.

339
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:21,088
Yes, honey.
You can do it one night for Daddy. Come on.

340
00:26:21,172 --> 00:26:24,258
- This doesn't sit well with me.
- I know what you mean.

341
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:28,804
Lorraine, are you serious?
Is she kidding?

342
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:33,017
That's not gonna fit in your tent, Lorraine.

343
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,603
I'm gonna make it fit, Dad.

344
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:44,570
- Hey, come on. We're making s'mores.
- I'll help you.

345
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:47,907
Actually, we're trying
to eat only organic food.

346
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,786
- We're trying to eat only organic food.
- Is that for the baby?

347
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:54,955
Come on. Baby'll love a s'more.
Party in your tummy.

348
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,836
Cool. The Bakers are having a campout.
Can I go over?

349
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,466
Why have a campout when you can have
a full-on fondue party right here?

350
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:07,218
Sweet.

351
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:10,429
Charlie, you're worse than a kitten.

352
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,857
Babe, that's your fourth s'more.

353
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:26,028
My parents never let me have these.
They're amazing.

354
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:34,995
Do you think we should be
more strict with the kids?

355
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:41,085
No, honey. We give them love and guidance.
What else is there, really?

356
00:27:41,168 --> 00:27:44,505
Every time we turn around,
they're in trouble, about to get into it,

357
00:27:44,588 --> 00:27:47,049
or laying out a long-term plan to create it.

358
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:51,303
Dad, how come those guys
know how to camp so good?

359
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,900
- Hey. Hey! What if we sing a camp song?
- OK. Sounds good.

360
00:28:19,206 --> 00:28:21,709
What do you say we give 'em
a run for their money?

361
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:47,068
Come on. Stand up.

362
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,425
This guy is so competitive!

363
00:29:27,316 --> 00:29:30,027
Boy, I love camping.

364
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:32,196
Yeah. This is fun.

365
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:37,827
- Good times. Good times.
- Good times, yeah.

366
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:42,999
Hey, kids. Didn't you love
blowing Murtaugh off the lake last night?

367
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,084
Kids?

368
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:47,378
Honey, they're all in the house.

369
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:49,505
- No.
- Yeah.

370
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,597
Hello?

371
00:29:58,681 --> 00:30:00,599
Happy?

372
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:03,185
They can't spend one night in the tent?

373
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,104
Hey, Tom.

374
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:12,737
Now, what does that show-off want?

375
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:15,448
What a day. Hey, Tom?

376
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:18,951
Boy, you have got this place looking...

377
00:30:20,202 --> 00:30:25,207
Anyway, I see the troops are sleeping in.

378
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:28,961
They're already up.
They're out cutting wood and making biscuits

379
00:30:29,045 --> 00:30:32,423
and blazing a new trail out back -
nothing out of the ordinary.

380
00:30:32,506 --> 00:30:37,636
Yeah. Really impressive. Listen, the missus
and I are thinking of putting on a little spread.

381
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,972
Since the kids are getting along so well,

382
00:30:40,056 --> 00:30:43,142
why don't you and the gang
come to The Boulders for brunch?

383
00:30:43,225 --> 00:30:46,103
- Actually, we have to...
- Cool, what time?

384
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:48,981
Mimosas at noon, on the dot.

385
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:51,567
Yeah!

386
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:58,574
Attagirl.

387
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,160
Take it away, honey.

388
00:31:09,085 --> 00:31:11,003
Adios, amigo.

389
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:16,217
- Isn't he like the coolest dad ever?
- Yeah. Cool.

390
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:27,520
Whoa, dude!

391
00:31:30,564 --> 00:31:32,650
Awesome, dude.

392
00:31:37,488 --> 00:31:40,574
Kids, you stay right here.

393
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:45,538
Welcome to The Boulders.

394
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:50,126
- Hey. Let's say hello.
- Hi.

395
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:54,714
Hey. Thanks for having us.
Where's the gift shop?

396
00:31:54,797 --> 00:31:57,800
You brought your dog.

397
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:01,220
- Sorry. Just say "sit".
- Down, Gunner.

398
00:32:03,264 --> 00:32:05,599
Tom. Baker!

399
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:11,939
Somebody help.

400
00:32:14,984 --> 00:32:18,237
- I'm fine.
- They're called obedience schools, Baker!

401
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,197
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

402
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:24,285
- Tie Fido up for five minutes.
- Honey, he's fine. Just let him play.

403
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:29,165
We don't want that animal near the dining set.
It was a gift from the king of Thailand.

404
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:32,209
Mark, there's a leash in the car. Get it.

405
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:34,587
- Why don't we all go inside?
- Good idea.

406
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,380
I'll be right back.

407
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:40,092
Sarah. You wanna go on the Seadoo
with me and Jake before we eat?

408
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:42,428
Yeah. Sure.

409
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:44,597
Cool. Let's go.

410
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:52,605
Are you coming or not, dude?

411
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:54,357
Yeah.

412
00:32:55,483 --> 00:32:57,693
Jimmy. Almost forgot.

413
00:32:57,777 --> 00:33:01,989
Tom, for heaven's sake.
You didn't have to do this.

414
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:05,076
- "Sparkling Cheesehead"?
- Wisconsin's finest bubbly.

415
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:11,624
I'm sure it is. Might have to let this baby
age about two, three hundred years, Tom.

416
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:17,505
Superstar, do me a favour. Take this to
the cellar and bring a bottle of Taittinger.

417
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:20,883
- Sure.
- I'll give you a hand.

418
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:25,429
- It's a fantastic place.
- It's not much, but I call it a second home.

419
00:33:27,682 --> 00:33:31,060
How come you guys
haven't built your own house up here?

420
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:34,772
With 12 kids, you've gotta use the money
for food and water.

421
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:39,485
I bet if Tom had kept that job at Illinois Poly
he could have built a place like this.

422
00:33:39,568 --> 00:33:43,447
Well, life's full of choices.
Some good, some not so good.

423
00:33:43,531 --> 00:33:48,244
Honey, why don't you take Kate and show her
the dining set the king of Thailand gave us?

424
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:52,415
- OK, honey.
- I'd love to look at the plates from a king.

425
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:57,044
- Don't get lost, honey.
- Tom, I wanna show you something.

426
00:33:57,128 --> 00:33:59,255
Feast your eyes on these honeys, Tom.

427
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:03,384
Albino ironwood,
right out of the Peruvian rainforest.

428
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:07,722
You can still smell the jungle on 'em.
Go ahead, take a whiff.

429
00:34:07,805 --> 00:34:12,727
Come on. Rest your honker
on the log and take a whiff.

430
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:17,440
- Smells like global warming.
- That's moss. It's moss, Tom.

431
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:20,443
Well, this is the trophy room.

432
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:27,408
- Are those your kids?
- Yeah. That's the Murtaugh victory reel.

433
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:31,245
- It's on a loop.
- It's a good room.

434
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:35,416
I'll tell you why
I love this room so much, Tom.

435
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:40,629
All the trophies, the ribbons,
the prizes - past, present and future.

436
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:43,090
It's proof that children can be groomed

437
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:46,719
to reflect the best aspects
of any given gene pool.

438
00:34:46,802 --> 00:34:51,849
- You just have to keep them on a short leash.
- I couldn't agree more.

439
00:34:51,932 --> 00:34:54,518
My Anne's proof of that.

440
00:34:54,602 --> 00:34:57,897
You're looking a lot more put together
than you did a few years ago.

441
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,398
Thanks.

442
00:34:59,482 --> 00:35:03,235
Remember your nose was too big,
and that skin irritation on your hand?

443
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:07,490
It just kept working its way
up your arm and into your neck...

444
00:35:08,157 --> 00:35:12,119
I'm glad that it's gone, though. Looks good.

445
00:35:12,203 --> 00:35:17,333
Well, if I remember correctly,
you weren't so hot yourself.

446
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:26,342
That mutt could use a shorter leash too.

447
00:35:31,514 --> 00:35:33,599
She's so cool.

448
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:39,271
Yeah, the kids and I spent a weekend
putting that dock together.

449
00:35:39,355 --> 00:35:43,484
Nothing like a little manual labour
to keep you humble. Sit down, Tom.

450
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:47,571
So Jimmy has matching pants to that shirt?

451
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:50,783
Boy, this place wasn't put together overnight.

452
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:53,703
- Does Daddy know about your tattoo?
- No.

453
00:35:55,538 --> 00:35:58,249
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I'm so sorry.

454
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:00,167
It's OK. I'm fine.

455
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:06,090
- It's like spring break. Hope I win.
- I've got a shirt you can borrow.

456
00:36:06,173 --> 00:36:08,509
- A shirt? OK.
- Mom, I...

457
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:12,930
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

458
00:36:13,014 --> 00:36:15,975
- If my dad finds out before I...
- You'll get grounded?

459
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:18,978
Please, just don't say anything.

460
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:26,610
Nice hands.

461
00:36:37,913 --> 00:36:39,832
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey, Dad.

462
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:42,501
You should see Mr Murtaugh's new Seadoo.

463
00:36:42,585 --> 00:36:48,257
That's terrific. Now turn around
and pretend to be looking at the view.

464
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:49,717
Why?

465
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,638
Turn around and pretend
to be looking at the view.

466
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:58,559
Are you still in touch with your dark gifts?

467
00:36:58,642 --> 00:37:02,772
Punking, practical jokes,
soaking underwear and...

468
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:05,024
- Meat.
- Yeah.

469
00:37:05,107 --> 00:37:07,109
- Classic.
- Yeah.

470
00:37:07,193 --> 00:37:12,406
- Yeah, I'm in touch. Why?
- I have a mission for you.

471
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,700
Who's the target?

472
00:37:14,784 --> 00:37:16,869
Murtaugh.

473
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,207
I can help you. Hi.

474
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:25,378
- As long as I don't do time for the crime.
- Hey, guys. Hi.

475
00:37:25,461 --> 00:37:27,088
Done.

476
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:30,549
No grounding. No allowance dockage.

477
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:33,761
No spiel about the difference
between right and wrong.

478
00:37:33,844 --> 00:37:37,014
And you have no problem
with the methods that I choose.

479
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:40,851
It's your contract, do with it what you will.

480
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:44,021
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

481
00:37:44,105 --> 00:37:47,817
Hey, give Daddy a hug. Nail him.

482
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,570
Guys, guys. Guys! I have a mission for you.

483
00:37:51,654 --> 00:37:55,074
- It's top-secret, and it's high-priority.
- Yeah? What is it?

484
00:37:55,157 --> 00:37:57,576
Come on. I'll show you.

485
00:38:13,676 --> 00:38:15,761
- Positions.
- Check.

486
00:38:28,149 --> 00:38:31,277
My gosh. It's a purple bigfoot.

487
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,280
- What are you talking about?
- A purple bigfoot!

488
00:38:34,363 --> 00:38:36,699
- A what?
- I don't see anything.

489
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,201
Made you look, made you look.

490
00:38:39,285 --> 00:38:41,704
- Made you look.
- You are so stupid.

491
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:47,960
- Did I mention the dining set was a gift?
- The king of Thailand. Yeah, you did.

492
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:51,714
- Give me that roll.
- I see your kids can't wait to get started.

493
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:55,718
Well, that's just the way they are.

494
00:38:57,928 --> 00:39:02,099
Hey, you guys.
No eating until everyone's seated.

495
00:39:05,061 --> 00:39:08,397
- Eyes up here, honey.
- Doesn't she look hot?

496
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:20,951
Doesn't hold a candle to you, honey.
Come on, let's sit down.

497
00:39:21,035 --> 00:39:24,246
- Where have you been all my life?
- All right.

498
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,208
- Tom, right over here.
- Thank you.

499
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:29,794
Ignore the place card.
Sit next to your wife.

500
00:39:29,877 --> 00:39:32,838
Fine. Fine, if you want chaos.
Right here, Tom.

501
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:35,216
Believe me, I don't mind.

502
00:39:35,299 --> 00:39:38,344
Dad. Don't...

503
00:39:38,427 --> 00:39:40,388
The seat cushion is soft.

504
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:43,057
- So, you two play tennis?
- Yeah.

505
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,518
- You're in the meat seat.
- What?

506
00:40:00,616 --> 00:40:03,285
I knew that dog was gonna be trouble.

507
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:11,711
Sit!

508
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:18,968
My china.

509
00:40:23,431 --> 00:40:26,642
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

510
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:28,477
You don't know?

511
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:43,075
It's OK. It happens all the time.

512
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:47,538
It doesn't. I'm so sorry. I'm really
embarrassed. Thank you for the lovely shirt.

513
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:49,999
I insist that you send me a bill for this.

514
00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:54,045
Don't even think about it.
What's a few thousand dollars here or there?

515
00:40:54,128 --> 00:40:56,714
The main thing is you had a good time.

516
00:40:56,797 --> 00:41:00,051
We'll talk about it later.
I'll see you on the tennis court.

517
00:41:00,134 --> 00:41:02,219
Bring your A game.

518
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:05,973
- Bye.
- What was that?

519
00:41:06,057 --> 00:41:07,933
- Nothing.
- That was not nothing.

520
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:11,896
This was not nothing. That was something.
All right. In the house.

521
00:41:12,897 --> 00:41:14,565
I know. I'm a horrible father.

522
00:41:14,648 --> 00:41:17,985
- Honey, you broke your promise.
- What promise?

523
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:21,280
That you'd not get involved
in this competitive thing.

524
00:41:21,364 --> 00:41:23,199
It's just all so infantile.

525
00:41:23,282 --> 00:41:26,202
- He tried to tell us how to raise the kids.
- Meaning?

526
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:28,746
- He thinks the kids are...
- Did he say it?

527
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:34,001
No, but you could tell that he implied
that's what he thought, that the kids were...

528
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,128
That's right.

529
00:41:39,173 --> 00:41:44,220
"I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-l-am."

530
00:41:44,303 --> 00:41:46,472
Aren't you a little old for that book?

531
00:41:46,555 --> 00:41:49,350
- She's reading to the baby.
- Reading to the baby?

532
00:41:49,433 --> 00:41:53,688
Unborn babies, they're comforted
by the sound of their mother's voice.

533
00:41:53,771 --> 00:41:58,234
- Just don't spoil my linebacker.
- The baby's gonna be what it wants to be.

534
00:41:58,317 --> 00:42:02,196
Just let us be the parents, OK, Dad?
Come on, Bud. I'm hungry.

535
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:03,906
Yeah. Me too.

536
00:42:08,536 --> 00:42:11,080
- Hi, Mr Baker.
- Hi, Eliot. What's up?

537
00:42:11,163 --> 00:42:13,374
- I was looking for Sarah.
- You mean Jake?

538
00:42:13,457 --> 00:42:16,752
Sarah and I and Calvin,
we're going boarding this afternoon.

539
00:42:16,836 --> 00:42:19,005
Well, she'll be back soon.

540
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:23,718
- OK. I'll just wait on the dock.
- Wait, wait, wait.

541
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:25,636
Sit down.

542
00:42:35,271 --> 00:42:38,107
What do you do for a living, Eliot?

543
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:42,945
- I'm in eighth grade.
- Yeah. Right.

544
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:47,033
- And how's that going for you?
- Fine.

545
00:42:47,116 --> 00:42:51,454
- Are you on any teams?
- Football, boarding and baseball.

546
00:42:51,537 --> 00:42:55,082
All that focus on sports -
that must impact your grades quite a bit.

547
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:59,337
No. Actually, you know,
I'm an honours student.

548
00:43:00,504 --> 00:43:04,050
- You play any instruments?
- Drums.

549
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:08,304
You're probably
in one of those punk bands, right?

550
00:43:09,597 --> 00:43:12,224
Timpani. You know, school orchestra.

551
00:43:14,143 --> 00:43:16,729
- Hey, Eliot.
- See you, Mr Baker.

552
00:43:16,812 --> 00:43:18,898
Later, dude... Dad.

553
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,825
Guys.

554
00:43:31,494 --> 00:43:35,039
- What now?
- Mind if I go waterboarding with you?

555
00:43:35,122 --> 00:43:38,125
It's kneeboarding,
and I'm pretty sure you can't do it.

556
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:40,670
If Jimmy can do it, I can.
You must be Calvin.

557
00:43:40,753 --> 00:43:44,298
- Nice to meet you. I just got back from Yale.
- Congratulations.

558
00:43:44,382 --> 00:43:47,426
I'll just squeeze in over here. There we go.

559
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:49,720
- Is everybody ready?
- Yeah.

560
00:43:49,804 --> 00:43:54,183
- Fun?
- Yeah. Why don't you go first?

561
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:57,812
Guys, keep an eye on him, all right?
You ready, Mr Baker?

562
00:43:57,895 --> 00:43:59,980
OK, I'm...

563
00:44:07,655 --> 00:44:12,284
- Sorry he interrogated you.
- My dad would have done the same thing.

564
00:44:18,874 --> 00:44:22,545
- Really?
- You should come to my house sometime.

565
00:44:32,596 --> 00:44:37,101
He's really easy and likes to keep low-key.

566
00:44:37,184 --> 00:44:41,230
- Do you have a favourite subject?
- Probably math.

567
00:44:51,907 --> 00:44:53,993
Stop!

568
00:44:56,704 --> 00:44:59,999
You'll do better next time, Mr Baker. It's OK.

569
00:45:00,082 --> 00:45:04,128
- Are you sure he'll be OK?
- Yeah, he'll be fine.

570
00:45:08,132 --> 00:45:10,217
Dad! Are you OK?

571
00:45:11,427 --> 00:45:13,846
It's all good.

572
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:22,313
Well... I'll go put on a little perfume.

573
00:45:25,149 --> 00:45:28,736
Sarah, Eliot seems OK.

574
00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:32,615
- I see why you like him.
- Somebody's turning red.

575
00:45:32,698 --> 00:45:34,283
Shut up!

576
00:45:35,326 --> 00:45:37,870
Thanks a lot, Dad.

577
00:45:37,953 --> 00:45:41,123
- What did I say?
- Men can be so clueless.

578
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:43,709
Honey, men are clueless.

579
00:45:46,337 --> 00:45:49,507
- I'll go talk to her.
- Mom, let me do this, OK?

580
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:54,053
Trust me, I've got experience
in the area of parental harassment.

581
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:05,564
Hey, I totally know how you feel.

582
00:46:05,648 --> 00:46:07,733
How are you?

583
00:46:09,235 --> 00:46:14,156
Dad can be pretty hands-on,
in-your-face sometimes.

584
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,534
Just leave me alone.

585
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:26,293
A, I'm never trying to help her again.

586
00:46:26,377 --> 00:46:29,839
And B, I cannot wait to move to New York.

587
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,222
- What are you doing here?
- This is where I run. What are you doing?

588
00:47:20,306 --> 00:47:25,227
- I like to get out of the house.
- Take a break from the perfect daughter bit?

589
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:29,523
Hey, I'm not the only one who's
putting on an act for Daddy around here.

590
00:47:29,607 --> 00:47:32,193
You've hated the city since we were kids.

591
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:35,738
- Why go to school there?
- Seemed like the right thing to do.

592
00:47:35,821 --> 00:47:40,618
Did it seem like the right thing to do because
your parents said it was the right thing to do?

593
00:47:40,701 --> 00:47:43,579
No. My parents wanted me
closer to home, that's why.

594
00:47:43,663 --> 00:47:46,540
Are you gonna live at home forever?

595
00:47:46,624 --> 00:47:50,378
I just gotta figure out my next move and do it.

596
00:47:50,461 --> 00:47:54,715
How about you, superstar?
What's the master plan?

597
00:47:54,799 --> 00:47:58,094
Somehow I gotta tell my dad
I'm not built for corporate life.

598
00:47:58,177 --> 00:48:02,431
- Good luck.
- So for now, I'm just gonna draw.

599
00:48:02,515 --> 00:48:05,434
- What do you draw?
- Stay still, Baker.

600
00:48:05,518 --> 00:48:10,189
Whoa. Yeah, right. You're not drawing me,
cos I'm gonna... OK, right here? Is this good?

601
00:48:10,272 --> 00:48:13,442
- If I stay here? It might be better...
- Stop smiling.

602
00:48:23,035 --> 00:48:27,039
- Sarah, come on. Hurry up!
- OK. OK.

603
00:48:27,123 --> 00:48:30,209
- Has anybody seen my other tennis shoe?
- No.

604
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:32,211
No, I haven't.

605
00:48:32,294 --> 00:48:36,465
- Have you seen my other tennis shoe?
- No. Chiseller!

606
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:38,843
You chiselling little...

607
00:48:44,515 --> 00:48:45,558
Great.

608
00:48:50,187 --> 00:48:52,523
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Hey, guys.

609
00:48:52,606 --> 00:48:54,442
- Good to see you.
- Hi.

610
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:57,528
Nice shoes. Kidding. Let's warm up.

611
00:48:57,611 --> 00:48:59,697
OK, let's do it.

612
00:49:02,074 --> 00:49:04,744
- Come on, Murtaugh!
- Got it.

613
00:49:05,286 --> 00:49:07,913
I don't remember you out here
when we were kids.

614
00:49:07,997 --> 00:49:12,335
Dad didn't allow us
to come out into the woods. OK, I'm done.

615
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,924
That's Charlie Baker
figuring out his next move.

616
00:49:19,008 --> 00:49:22,887
- You're good.
- Tell my dad.

617
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:26,015
Maybe he'll let me transfer
to Madison Art School.

618
00:49:26,098 --> 00:49:31,729
- You wanna live up here and go to school?
- This lake is my favourite place on the planet.

619
00:49:31,812 --> 00:49:35,649
- Why?
- I've always fantasised about moving here.

620
00:49:35,733 --> 00:49:38,361
I don't know,
maybe open up a garage or something.

621
00:49:38,444 --> 00:49:43,658
- Looks like you figured out your next move.
- I think you're right.

622
00:49:45,201 --> 00:49:47,328
Wanna go for a walk or something?

623
00:49:47,411 --> 00:49:53,250
- Is Charlie Baker asking me out on a date?
- I'm not sure our fathers would approve.

624
00:49:53,334 --> 00:49:55,419
Let's go.

625
00:49:58,964 --> 00:50:01,759
Yours. Nice. Nice!
This is mine.

626
00:50:04,553 --> 00:50:06,514
- It's these shoes.
- OK. All right.

627
00:50:06,597 --> 00:50:08,974
A poor workman blames his tools, Tom.

628
00:50:09,058 --> 00:50:13,104
- Just serve it.
- This is payback for the china.

629
00:50:13,187 --> 00:50:17,692
Come on. Give me your best, Jimmy,
give me your best.

630
00:50:17,775 --> 00:50:20,194
- I got it.
- I got it.

631
00:50:20,277 --> 00:50:23,656
- I got it, I got it, I got it.
- I got it.

632
00:50:23,739 --> 00:50:24,907
Mine.

633
00:50:24,991 --> 00:50:26,867
- Got it.
- I got it.

634
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:37,169
- Mine.
- Whoa.

635
00:50:40,089 --> 00:50:44,051
- It's turbo.
- I'm in so much trouble. There's no way.

636
00:50:44,135 --> 00:50:46,762
- Don't be a wimp.
- I'm not a wimp.

637
00:50:46,846 --> 00:50:49,265
- Come on. Get in.
- OK, just one little cruise.

638
00:50:49,348 --> 00:50:51,892
Come on, Baker. I'm getting old here.

639
00:50:51,976 --> 00:50:54,061
Just be careful.

640
00:50:55,187 --> 00:50:56,230
Whoa! Slow down!

641
00:51:15,249 --> 00:51:20,629
Mr and Mrs Baker, excuse me. There's
a call from security over at the gift shop.

642
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:23,507
- What's this about?
- Just follow me.

643
00:51:23,591 --> 00:51:25,676
Slow down! Stop!

644
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,805
Slow down!

645
00:51:36,228 --> 00:51:40,524
We're willing to let it slide if you
promise to keep your kids under control.

646
00:51:40,608 --> 00:51:43,527
I really appreciate that.
We'll take care of it.

647
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:47,823
- There you go. Thanks, Skippy.
- Thank you, Mr Murtaugh.

648
00:51:47,907 --> 00:51:49,784
Are you just gonna talk to her?

649
00:51:49,867 --> 00:51:53,287
How I discipline my kids
is none of your business.

650
00:51:53,371 --> 00:51:57,583
You know, I've been trying to say this
in a nice way, but...

651
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:01,587
Well, there's a reason
your kids are screw-ups.

652
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:05,049
My kids screwed up. They are not screw-ups.

653
00:52:05,132 --> 00:52:09,845
You're not strict enough.
Parenting isn't a popularity contest, Tom,

654
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:13,599
but I guess if you knew that,
your kids wouldn't be so undisciplined.

655
00:52:13,683 --> 00:52:17,061
The only problem with my kids
is they're hanging out with yours.

656
00:52:17,144 --> 00:52:19,730
It wasn't my daughter
who got caught stealing.

657
00:52:19,814 --> 00:52:22,024
It wasn't my son who trashed a tennis court.

658
00:52:22,108 --> 00:52:25,653
Do you actually think
I'm screwing up my kids, Baker?

659
00:52:25,736 --> 00:52:28,280
Yeah. And one day they're gonna crack.

660
00:52:28,364 --> 00:52:31,409
Well, why don't we test that theory?
On Labor Day.

661
00:52:31,492 --> 00:52:35,496
Murtaughs versus Bakers. For the cup.

662
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:37,957
You're on.

663
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,334
We'll see you there.

664
00:52:42,586 --> 00:52:43,713
Let's go.

665
00:52:43,796 --> 00:52:46,799
Did you just agree
to that competition thing and the cup?

666
00:52:46,882 --> 00:52:48,968
Yeah.

667
00:52:51,262 --> 00:52:53,931
OK, missy, let's go walk and talk.

668
00:52:54,724 --> 00:52:59,603
Now, tell me what this is all about,
because it's so not you.

669
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:04,108
- I was embarrassed.
- Look at me, honey.

670
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:06,485
Embarrassed about what?

671
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:09,864
Make-up.

672
00:53:09,947 --> 00:53:15,745
Honey, you know you can come to me
any time with anything. You know that, right?

673
00:53:18,205 --> 00:53:23,419
And I know why you wanted the make-up.
It was for Eliot, right?

674
00:53:24,295 --> 00:53:25,880
Yeah.

675
00:53:25,963 --> 00:53:29,592
I'm just not pretty like Nora or Lorraine.

676
00:53:31,302 --> 00:53:35,181
I thought maybe the make-up would help.

677
00:53:35,264 --> 00:53:37,933
You're beautiful.

678
00:53:38,017 --> 00:53:41,437
I want you to remember
something else that's really important.

679
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,900
When you like a boy,
never be anybody but yourself.

680
00:53:46,776 --> 00:53:50,279
Eliot liked you without make-up, didn't he?

681
00:53:51,113 --> 00:53:54,784
- Do you think he really likes me?
- How could he not?

682
00:53:57,286 --> 00:54:00,081
- No more felonies. Deal?
- Deal.

683
00:54:00,164 --> 00:54:02,249
Good.

684
00:54:03,292 --> 00:54:07,505
- The Labor Day Cup's gonna be a bloodbath.
- You got that right.

685
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:13,302
From now on, no seeing the Murtaughs,
no talking to them, no thinking about them.

686
00:54:13,386 --> 00:54:16,472
- Can't we compete and still see them?
- No.

687
00:54:16,555 --> 00:54:19,266
Right now, I am not a father. I am a coach.

688
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:24,563
And we're gonna be training twice a day,
every day, starting outside in ten minutes.

689
00:54:27,775 --> 00:54:30,987
Jumping jacks, jumping jacks. Good.

690
00:54:31,862 --> 00:54:37,201
Lorraine, come on. Push-ups. One, two.
Now back up to jumping jacks.

691
00:54:37,284 --> 00:54:40,538
- Lorraine, come on.
- OK.

692
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:45,835
And toss.

693
00:54:45,918 --> 00:54:47,461
Toss.

694
00:54:47,545 --> 00:54:50,673
- Toss. Toss.
- Dad!

695
00:54:50,756 --> 00:54:52,550
- Just toss.
- Dad, lay off.

696
00:54:52,633 --> 00:54:54,760
- Toss!
- I'm tossing.

697
00:54:54,844 --> 00:54:57,013
No crying.

698
00:54:57,096 --> 00:55:00,641
- Step back.
- That's it. I can't handle the pressure, Dad!

699
00:55:00,725 --> 00:55:01,976
Eggs cost money.

700
00:55:04,937 --> 00:55:10,943
OK, it's a three-legged race, but run
as if you had two! On your mark, get set, go.

701
00:55:11,027 --> 00:55:12,695
Go. Let's go.

702
00:55:13,904 --> 00:55:15,406
- Your fault!
- Hey!

703
00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:18,284
Come on, come on, get in. Come on.

704
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:24,123
- Murtaugh! Murtaugh! Murtaugh! Murtaugh!
- Dad! We're not Murtaughs!

705
00:55:35,134 --> 00:55:37,595
Take a deep swing. Boom, just like that.

706
00:55:54,779 --> 00:55:57,281
Give it a good one. Come on.

707
00:55:57,365 --> 00:55:58,699
One more.

708
00:56:03,788 --> 00:56:05,414
That's a zero.

709
00:56:20,596 --> 00:56:25,351
I really love having a family dinner where
all you can hear is forks hitting the plates.

710
00:56:25,434 --> 00:56:30,064
You know, this could be our last chance
together and you're totally ruining it.

711
00:56:30,147 --> 00:56:36,821
I'm glad we're moving to Houston. And so is
Iron Mike or Donna Baker Butkus McNulty.

712
00:56:48,332 --> 00:56:50,001
Bulk up.

713
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:59,510
You're burning a hole in my face.

714
00:56:59,593 --> 00:57:01,804
Tom.

715
00:57:01,887 --> 00:57:05,307
You've gotta stop
this whole training camp thing.

716
00:57:05,391 --> 00:57:11,647
This is not some little fence-line squabble.
This is an epic battle between two families.

717
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:16,110
No. No, no, honey.
I think this is Tom versus Jimmy.

718
00:57:17,278 --> 00:57:20,865
I'm sorry, General, but you're losing
the respect of your troops.

719
00:57:20,948 --> 00:57:23,409
That's dangerous. Give the kids some space.

720
00:57:23,492 --> 00:57:25,786
Are you asking me to back out?

721
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:30,750
No, honey. It's just... Especially with Sarah.
This is her first crush. Come on.

722
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:33,878
- What, with Eliot?
- Yes.

723
00:57:34,628 --> 00:57:38,090
She needs to know that we trust her.

724
00:57:38,174 --> 00:57:41,427
She couldn't come to me
and tell me she wanted to wear make-up.

725
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:46,724
Is that the kind of relationship
you want her to have with us?

726
00:57:55,524 --> 00:57:58,527
- Hey, Sarina. How are you?
- Hi.

727
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:01,197
Let's run.

728
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,574
Just leave it. They'll get somebody.

729
00:58:03,658 --> 00:58:06,118
The kids drop stuff all the time
and leave me.

730
00:58:06,202 --> 00:58:08,371
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

731
00:58:08,454 --> 00:58:12,500
- How do you manage 12 kids?
- With great difficulty. Trust me.

732
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:16,045
Good, cos I have no idea what I'm doing.

733
00:58:17,046 --> 00:58:20,383
You've got a lot of fruit.
I'd get some of this refined sugar.

734
00:58:20,466 --> 00:58:24,553
It's great for
negotiating purposes or whatever.

735
00:58:24,637 --> 00:58:27,348
Jimmy's gone overboard
with this tough love thing.

736
00:58:27,431 --> 00:58:30,393
The kids are miserable
and he doesn't even see it.

737
00:58:30,476 --> 00:58:32,728
He and Tom bring out the best in each other.

738
00:58:32,812 --> 00:58:36,357
I'm actually getting a kick out of it.
Very entertaining.

739
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,859
- And exhausting.
- This is good.

740
00:58:39,193 --> 00:58:42,154
If tonight's good, I'll ask my dad.

741
00:58:43,447 --> 00:58:48,035
So hopefully tonight will work.
OK. See you.

742
00:58:52,748 --> 00:58:54,834
Not my little girl.

743
00:59:03,342 --> 00:59:05,094
Hey, Dad.

744
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,513
Are you OK?

745
00:59:07,596 --> 00:59:13,728
Yeah. I just need you to help me
pace out 25 yards for the egg race,

746
00:59:13,811 --> 00:59:16,605
starting here, OK? There you go.

747
00:59:16,689 --> 00:59:18,774
- Yeah.
- OK, go ahead.

748
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:25,406
- Hey, Dad, I was...
- Those steps are too small.

749
00:59:30,661 --> 00:59:35,499
- Those steps...
- Can I go to the movies with Eliot tonight?

750
00:59:37,585 --> 00:59:39,420
...are too big.

751
00:59:45,926 --> 00:59:48,387
I guess so.

752
00:59:55,436 --> 00:59:56,437
Sarah!

753
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:02,068
Sarah! Nora has to urinate, and a full bladder
puts inordinate strain on the embryotic sac...

754
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:05,196
Kim! Thank you.
We could just go with "hurry up".

755
01:00:05,279 --> 01:00:07,698
Hurry up!

756
01:00:08,824 --> 01:00:11,744
I need Lorraine.

757
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,166
You get Lorraine, I'll pee outside.

758
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:21,962
Hey. It's me.

759
01:00:23,464 --> 01:00:26,175
How's it going?

760
01:00:27,635 --> 01:00:34,100
Eliot asked me out, and I'm kind of new
to the dating thing, so...

761
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:42,692
- Are you gonna make me beg?
- I was thinking about it.

762
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:47,196
Come on.

763
01:00:48,364 --> 01:00:51,283
Let's start with your make-up.

764
01:00:54,078 --> 01:00:56,163
Lorraine...

765
01:00:57,248 --> 01:01:00,042
- Thanks.
- Don't worry about it.

766
01:01:02,336 --> 01:01:03,838
- Pink?
- Come on.

767
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:06,882
Can't we do, like, a skin colour?

768
01:01:07,425 --> 01:01:10,136
There you go. It looks good.

769
01:01:16,726 --> 01:01:18,769
Hey, guys.

770
01:01:18,853 --> 01:01:21,022
Guys. I need everybody's attention.

771
01:01:21,105 --> 01:01:24,984
Sarah's about to come downstairs,
and she's going on her date tonight.

772
01:01:25,067 --> 01:01:28,988
She looks a little different,
so I would really appreciate it

773
01:01:29,071 --> 01:01:33,034
if you guys could give her
the respect that you never gave me,

774
01:01:33,117 --> 01:01:39,540
and not ridicule her style choices before she
enters the world of multi-gender interaction.

775
01:01:39,623 --> 01:01:42,793
So go about your little chores
and act completely natural.

776
01:01:42,877 --> 01:01:45,463
Lorraine.

777
01:01:45,546 --> 01:01:49,508
I think you're going
to do just fine in New York.

778
01:01:49,592 --> 01:01:51,677
Thank you.

779
01:02:03,314 --> 01:02:05,816
Hubba-hubba.

780
01:02:19,121 --> 01:02:21,749
You look very pretty, honey. You always do.

781
01:02:21,832 --> 01:02:23,876
Thank you.

782
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:26,295
Well, I'm going to the movies.

783
01:02:26,379 --> 01:02:28,923
Well, sounds good. Need some money?

784
01:02:29,006 --> 01:02:31,801
No. I have some from lawn mowing.

785
01:02:33,135 --> 01:02:37,056
- Limo's here.
- There's Mr Murtaugh.

786
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:42,144
Well, have fun, and I'll pick you up
outside the theatre at nine.

787
01:02:42,228 --> 01:02:44,313
Bye.

788
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:49,151
- Bye.
- Bye, cutie.

789
01:02:50,444 --> 01:02:53,781
I'll save a spot for you on the varsity.

790
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,202
Have fun.

791
01:02:59,745 --> 01:03:02,039
- Cute, isn't she?
- Yeah.

792
01:03:03,165 --> 01:03:06,794
Seems like yesterday that was you, missy.

793
01:03:09,588 --> 01:03:15,011
- You're not gonna start crying, are you, Dad?
- I'm a football coach, remember?

794
01:03:15,094 --> 01:03:18,556
- I like Henrietta.
- You are not calling it Henrietta.

795
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:21,559
All right. What have we got to eat?

796
01:03:29,317 --> 01:03:31,736
Can I go to the movies with Eliot?

797
01:03:31,819 --> 01:03:35,865
Can I go to the movies with Eliot?

798
01:03:37,825 --> 01:03:41,579
Honey, do you want something to eat?

799
01:03:43,456 --> 01:03:45,541
Tom, do you want something to eat?

800
01:03:45,624 --> 01:03:48,878
No. You know what?
Actually, I should go get Sarah.

801
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:51,255
It's 7:30. The movie just started.

802
01:03:51,339 --> 01:03:55,426
I'm not going directly.
I'm just gonna stop and get gas first.

803
01:03:55,509 --> 01:03:58,888
There's bound to be traffic,
cos it's Labor Day weekend.

804
01:03:58,971 --> 01:04:00,973
- Sure there is.
- I'll get going.

805
01:04:01,057 --> 01:04:06,145
And I don't trust those fish clocks.
They're notoriously slow.

806
01:04:06,228 --> 01:04:08,022
I love you, sweetheart.

807
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:09,607
Thank you.

808
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,692
One, please.

809
01:04:27,416 --> 01:04:30,002
What are you doing here?

810
01:04:30,086 --> 01:04:34,465
If you must know, I'm here to make sure
this movie is appropriate for our children.

811
01:04:34,548 --> 01:04:37,218
It's rated G.

812
01:04:38,928 --> 01:04:41,639
Sir, could you please sit down?

813
01:04:43,432 --> 01:04:47,853
- What are you doing here so early?
- Father of the daughter always arrives early.

814
01:04:47,937 --> 01:04:51,774
- Everybody knows that.
- Excuse me. Is there a problem here?

815
01:04:51,857 --> 01:04:54,944
- He's harassing me.
- He's guilty of overparenting.

816
01:04:55,027 --> 01:05:00,408
If you two can't keep it down,
I'm going to throw both of you out.

817
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:11,502
My God. Look at this.

818
01:05:12,294 --> 01:05:14,797
What? He's stretching.

819
01:05:18,592 --> 01:05:21,721
- He's doing "the move".
- What move?

820
01:05:23,681 --> 01:05:27,810
You're sitting in the theatre, you fake a yawn...

821
01:05:27,893 --> 01:05:30,604
Oh, boy, am I tired.

822
01:05:32,023 --> 01:05:34,358
Hand comes over.

823
01:05:34,442 --> 01:05:38,779
Then a little while later, head comes over,
giving you extra reach here.

824
01:05:38,863 --> 01:05:41,407
Mom, look at those two down there.

825
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:44,285
See what I mean?

826
01:05:44,368 --> 01:05:46,203
Sweet Jesus.

827
01:05:48,664 --> 01:05:53,127
- Warning number two.
- He was showing me "the move".

828
01:05:56,255 --> 01:05:58,382
Do you mind?

829
01:06:01,927 --> 01:06:05,348
- You don't know "the move"?
- No. I don't know "the move", OK?

830
01:06:05,431 --> 01:06:09,810
And I wasn't a hormone-crazed Romeo
when I was a kid. I had self-control.

831
01:06:09,894 --> 01:06:13,481
- I had social sophistication, like my son.
- Be quiet down there!

832
01:06:13,564 --> 01:06:18,194
- Your son has hormones like every teenager.
- Meaning what?

833
01:06:18,277 --> 01:06:22,239
Meaning on the sophistication scale,
he's one step above ape.

834
01:06:22,323 --> 01:06:26,535
- Are you calling my son an ape?
- He's an ape like every other male teenager.

835
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:29,538
- Take it back.
- I'm not gonna take it back.

836
01:06:29,622 --> 01:06:31,624
Take it...

837
01:06:31,707 --> 01:06:33,042
Take it back.

838
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:37,254
- Were you gonna poke me?
- No, I was not gonna poke you.

839
01:06:37,338 --> 01:06:40,716
- You were gonna poke me.
- Because you were asking for it.

840
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,761
If I'm asking for it,
why don't you give it to me?

841
01:06:43,844 --> 01:06:48,140
- You want a poke?
- What's going on down there?

842
01:06:48,224 --> 01:06:50,559
- Call that a poke?
- I call that a practice.

843
01:06:50,643 --> 01:06:54,063
- Give me your best poke. I want your best.
- You're asking for it.

844
01:06:54,146 --> 01:06:56,148
I do. Yeah.

845
01:06:59,068 --> 01:07:02,279
Hey! Call somebody. Somebody help.

846
01:07:10,913 --> 01:07:14,625
- Hey, honey, how did it go?
- Dad was totally spying on me.

847
01:07:14,709 --> 01:07:16,585
You ruined everything.

848
01:07:16,669 --> 01:07:21,966
There's no way that I'm competing for you
in that stupid cup tomorrow.

849
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:27,972
- I can't believe you did that.
- Really, Dad, that is so Big Brother.

850
01:07:28,055 --> 01:07:32,852
- Yeah, let's go.
- Come on, Bud, let's put this baby to bed.

851
01:07:32,935 --> 01:07:35,396
Not cool, Dad.

852
01:07:35,479 --> 01:07:41,861
You and Jimmy aren't so different, Dad.
Different styles, yeah, but same result.

853
01:07:41,944 --> 01:07:44,447
Let's go, guys.

854
01:07:45,156 --> 01:07:47,325
Honey.

855
01:07:47,408 --> 01:07:49,577
Honey, we talked about this, didn't we?

856
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:54,040
The tighter you hang on,
the more they're gonna pull away. Right?

857
01:07:54,123 --> 01:07:56,208
I'll go talk to her.

858
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:09,096
Well, we're gonna go compete for the cup.

859
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:14,018
Couldn't get any more volunteers?

860
01:08:14,101 --> 01:08:16,812
You gonna come
and watch us kick some hiney?

861
01:08:16,896 --> 01:08:21,567
Well, maybe I will, honey,
when I get everybody fed.

862
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:23,736
I'm sorry.

863
01:08:29,575 --> 01:08:33,204
- OK, guys. Come on, let's go.
- Come on, Dad.

864
01:08:33,287 --> 01:08:35,414
And I'm sorry too.

865
01:08:41,879 --> 01:08:46,759
- Did Dad go?
- Yep. With Kyle and Nigel.

866
01:09:01,816 --> 01:09:04,568
Hey. The Chiseller's got my wallet.

867
01:09:12,201 --> 01:09:14,787
- Check it out.
- Must have an escape hatch.

868
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:20,501
- Look at all this stuff.
- That's mine from, like, the '80s.

869
01:09:22,753 --> 01:09:24,839
Careful. Careful.

870
01:09:26,465 --> 01:09:28,759
Let me see that.

871
01:09:30,594 --> 01:09:32,930
Look at this.

872
01:09:33,014 --> 01:09:35,433
It's our old team flag.

873
01:09:35,516 --> 01:09:37,810
We lost to the Murtaughs by two points.

874
01:09:37,893 --> 01:09:40,271
Yeah, cos Mom fell in the sack race.

875
01:09:40,354 --> 01:09:43,274
Daddy carried me all the way home.
Fond memories.

876
01:09:43,357 --> 01:09:47,320
You know your father. He wants to be
a part of every single one of them.

877
01:09:47,403 --> 01:09:50,114
That's why he's having
such a hard time letting go.

878
01:09:50,197 --> 01:09:55,828
But one thing - no matter what Daddy says,
if he's in a good mood or a bad mood,

879
01:09:55,911 --> 01:09:58,831
you're his favourite team, right?

880
01:10:07,298 --> 01:10:10,217
And left. And right.

881
01:10:11,052 --> 01:10:13,763
And left. And right.

882
01:10:13,846 --> 01:10:15,806
And left...

883
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:17,975
Bakers.

884
01:10:20,311 --> 01:10:23,064
What gives, Tom? Couldn't rally your team?

885
01:10:23,147 --> 01:10:27,026
It's all I've got,
but it's enough to take you down, Murtaugh.

886
01:10:27,109 --> 01:10:31,989
Are you kidding me?
You'll be lucky to beat the Doobners.

887
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:37,912
- We'll see. Come on, guys.
- We'll see.

888
01:10:37,995 --> 01:10:43,668
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 46th
annual Lake Winnetka Labor Day Cup.

889
01:10:45,795 --> 01:10:49,173
Now, we have seven families
competing in ten events today.

890
01:10:49,256 --> 01:10:52,968
The family winning the most events
will win the cup. Simple enough.

891
01:10:53,052 --> 01:10:57,723
So let's get to it, all right?
Contestants, here we go.

892
01:11:00,601 --> 01:11:04,063
OK, guys. Let's do this.

893
01:11:11,487 --> 01:11:13,990
Hey, Dad. We're here.

894
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:23,416
Dad!

895
01:11:26,335 --> 01:11:29,463
There's the team. There's the team.

896
01:11:30,798 --> 01:11:33,009
You can't keep the varsity down.

897
01:11:33,092 --> 01:11:38,347
And I promise never to go on a date
with you and Eliot again.

898
01:11:40,182 --> 01:11:42,643
Hey, Murtaugh!

899
01:11:42,727 --> 01:11:45,396
This is our year!

900
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:47,440
Let's see what you got, Tom.

901
01:11:50,026 --> 01:11:53,112
- OK, Murtaughs.
- Huddling.

902
01:11:53,195 --> 01:11:55,865
I've been a jerk all week,
but that's old news.

903
01:11:55,948 --> 01:11:59,702
- Get loose. Don't let 'em intimidate you.
- Yeah!

904
01:11:59,785 --> 01:12:02,580
You each have a special talent.
I want you to use it.

905
01:12:02,663 --> 01:12:05,416
I don't care if we win or lose.
Just do your best.

906
01:12:05,499 --> 01:12:08,419
OK. Hey, what are you doing?

907
01:12:08,502 --> 01:12:11,005
Stop with the nicey-nice.

908
01:12:12,465 --> 01:12:18,095
Here's the game plan. We'll step on their
throats and press until they stop breathing.

909
01:12:18,179 --> 01:12:21,432
- Yeah!
- Get focused and stay with the game plan.

910
01:12:21,515 --> 01:12:25,102
- What would that be?
- We don't have a game plan, but...

911
01:12:25,186 --> 01:12:28,731
- Chin up. Charge the mountain!
- Exactly! That's the game plan.

912
01:12:28,814 --> 01:12:30,107
OK, break on three.

913
01:12:30,441 --> 01:12:32,985
One, two, three.

914
01:12:35,696 --> 01:12:37,657
Come on, come on, come on.

915
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:39,533
Come on, go. Come on, go. Go, go!

916
01:12:39,617 --> 01:12:41,285
Yes! Yes!

917
01:12:42,203 --> 01:12:44,705
Yeah, Mark! Come on.

918
01:12:45,498 --> 01:12:46,999
Go! Go!

919
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:49,627
Charge it, charge it, charge it!

920
01:12:58,928 --> 01:13:01,013
Good job.

921
01:13:02,848 --> 01:13:04,767
OK. That's OK.

922
01:13:09,397 --> 01:13:12,525
- Bull's -eye!
- One for the Bakers!

923
01:13:24,161 --> 01:13:26,455
Come on, Charlie.

924
01:13:26,539 --> 01:13:28,749
- That's it. That's it.
- Go! Go!

925
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:35,673
Go, superstar.

926
01:13:35,756 --> 01:13:37,591
Yeah!

927
01:13:38,592 --> 01:13:42,638
- Gotta be tough, Baker. Gotta be tough.
- What is this?

928
01:13:51,605 --> 01:13:53,482
Out.

929
01:14:09,123 --> 01:14:11,917
- Here we go, Tom.
- I'm OK, Murtaugh.

930
01:14:12,001 --> 01:14:14,211
Look out.

931
01:14:15,087 --> 01:14:17,882
Not your sport?

932
01:14:17,965 --> 01:14:20,343
Go for a jog.

933
01:14:20,426 --> 01:14:22,136
Come on. Keep up.

934
01:14:23,846 --> 01:14:26,098
Reverse.

935
01:14:26,182 --> 01:14:29,393
Couldn't have asked for a better day.

936
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:35,066
Look out!

937
01:14:38,444 --> 01:14:40,529
Ouch.

938
01:14:43,324 --> 01:14:49,538
Well, folks, for the first time since 1961,
our Labor Day Cup has ended in a tie.

939
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:55,503
The Miller family
will be taking third place.

940
01:14:55,586 --> 01:14:58,506
And to determine second place
and our champion,

941
01:14:58,589 --> 01:15:02,259
the Bakers and the Murtaughs
are going to have a canoe race

942
01:15:02,343 --> 01:15:05,763
from here to the State Forest
end of the park and back.

943
01:15:05,846 --> 01:15:08,349
And all family members must participate.

944
01:15:08,432 --> 01:15:12,478
Mike, I got a daughter who's due in a week.
She can't do that.

945
01:15:12,561 --> 01:15:15,815
Tom, maybe you can
work something out with Jimmy here.

946
01:15:15,898 --> 01:15:19,527
Looks like you're gonna have to forfeit, Tom.

947
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:21,696
Well...

948
01:15:29,912 --> 01:15:32,915
She can't do it, so we're done.

949
01:15:32,999 --> 01:15:35,084
And congratulations.

950
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:39,755
I'm going, Dad.

951
01:15:41,465 --> 01:15:44,844
You just pissed off
a severely hormonal pregnant woman.

952
01:15:44,927 --> 01:15:46,595
Let's do this!

953
01:15:47,221 --> 01:15:49,306
Nora?

954
01:15:51,559 --> 01:15:54,312
- Are you sure?
- I need a life jacket.

955
01:15:54,395 --> 01:15:57,565
- Go, Bakers.
- Come on, Murtaughs.

956
01:15:57,648 --> 01:16:01,819
- Lose those shoes. They're fancy and new.
- What? Yours are the same.

957
01:16:01,902 --> 01:16:04,488
I'm a mom. I need the height.
Take those off.

958
01:16:04,572 --> 01:16:07,992
Mom. Mine tie my new outfit in together.

959
01:16:12,872 --> 01:16:15,624
Stay on the north side of the lake.
There's less wind.

960
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:19,670
- Thanks, Murtaugh.
- You're welcome, Baker.

961
01:16:20,963 --> 01:16:23,591
Let's go, superstar.

962
01:16:23,674 --> 01:16:25,760
It's supposed to be fun.

963
01:16:42,485 --> 01:16:45,363
- You ready?
- Ready.

964
01:16:45,446 --> 01:16:48,449
- On your marks.
- Murtaugh!

965
01:16:48,532 --> 01:16:50,451
- Get set.
- Murtaugh!

966
01:17:03,506 --> 01:17:06,759
Go, Bakers! Go, Bakers!

967
01:17:13,641 --> 01:17:15,810
Come on, we'll catch up. Let's go.

968
01:17:15,893 --> 01:17:19,522
We're gonna win this, Murtaughs!

969
01:17:19,605 --> 01:17:22,358
Come on. Put some muscle in it, Bakers.

970
01:17:22,441 --> 01:17:24,527
Stroke.

971
01:17:26,862 --> 01:17:29,782
- Stroke.
- Stroke.

972
01:17:29,865 --> 01:17:32,827
Come on, superstar. Come on, Kenneth.

973
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:35,788
- Not this time, Murtaugh.
- That's what you think.

974
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,290
Stroke, stroke.

975
01:17:44,338 --> 01:17:46,882
I think we're taking on water.

976
01:17:46,966 --> 01:17:48,634
It's me.

977
01:17:48,718 --> 01:17:52,179
My God! My God!
Nora's water just broke.

978
01:17:54,265 --> 01:17:56,225
Jimmy!

979
01:17:56,308 --> 01:17:59,020
- Row! Row!
- Jimmy!

980
01:18:00,021 --> 01:18:03,941
- Something's wrong, Jimmy.
- He's trying to pull a fast one. Now, paddle.

981
01:18:04,025 --> 01:18:07,111
- I don't believe it.
- What if somebody's hurt?

982
01:18:07,194 --> 01:18:09,780
Honey, we have a substantial lead. It's a trick.

983
01:18:09,864 --> 01:18:15,494
- How can you be sure?
- I don't wanna lose. Now, paddle. Stroke.

984
01:18:16,412 --> 01:18:18,247
OK, everyone, calm down.

985
01:18:18,331 --> 01:18:21,375
- If we cut through, the road's not far.
- Can you get us there?

986
01:18:21,459 --> 01:18:24,462
- Hello. Nature boy, remember?
- Let's go.

987
01:18:24,545 --> 01:18:26,339
- Sit tight.
- Go faster.

988
01:18:26,422 --> 01:18:29,133
- No, Bud. Stay with Nora.
- Row.

989
01:18:30,926 --> 01:18:34,555
Annie, what are you doing?
What are you doing, superstar? Paddle.

990
01:18:34,638 --> 01:18:37,641
I'm not a superstar, Dad.

991
01:18:39,644 --> 01:18:42,730
I'm just a person
who's trying to have her own life.

992
01:18:42,813 --> 01:18:46,025
And this is not my idea of living. It's yours.

993
01:18:48,569 --> 01:18:50,905
Like my tattoo?

994
01:18:54,492 --> 01:18:58,037
- Annie, get back in this boat.
- You'll have to win it without me too.

995
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,623
Eliot, don't you dare. Don't you...

996
01:19:00,706 --> 01:19:03,751
- I'm outta here.
- Kenneth!

997
01:19:04,251 --> 01:19:07,922
- Not cool, Dad.
- Becky, don't you...

998
01:19:08,005 --> 01:19:11,300
- You've gotta lighten up.
- Daniel!

999
01:19:11,384 --> 01:19:14,095
- We like the Bakers.
- Yeah, Dad.

1000
01:19:14,178 --> 01:19:16,806
Lisa! Robin!

1001
01:19:16,889 --> 01:19:21,978
OK, that's it. You know what? You kids
are gonna be cut off if you don't, you know...

1002
01:19:22,061 --> 01:19:25,272
No more charge accounts. Think about that.

1003
01:19:25,356 --> 01:19:28,234
- What is wrong with you?
- I want to win!

1004
01:19:28,317 --> 01:19:32,655
You don't get it, Sarina. It's not me.
It's him. It's Tom.

1005
01:19:32,738 --> 01:19:35,950
He was always the popular one.
He was the one everybody liked.

1006
01:19:36,033 --> 01:19:39,036
Everybody. All the girls.
All the parents liked him.

1007
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:43,499
- My own father even liked him better.
- That was 18 years before I was born.

1008
01:19:43,582 --> 01:19:47,712
Get over it. Look, your kids
are trying to tell you something.

1009
01:19:47,795 --> 01:19:51,924
And unless you wanna start looking
for wife number four, you'd better listen.

1010
01:19:52,008 --> 01:19:54,093
Now, paddle.

1011
01:19:56,137 --> 01:19:59,432
- Watch out.
- Are you sure you're OK?

1012
01:19:59,515 --> 01:20:02,601
- 50 cents says it's a girl.
- I'll take that bet.

1013
01:20:02,685 --> 01:20:04,687
- I'm in.
- Mom, Mom, Mom!

1014
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:07,773
- I'm all right, I'm all right.
- I got you, I got you!

1015
01:20:07,857 --> 01:20:11,235
That's OK. I got my hips to balance me.
How are you feeling?

1016
01:20:11,319 --> 01:20:13,237
- Cramping a little.
- OK, how often?

1017
01:20:13,321 --> 01:20:15,906
Just a couple of times so far.

1018
01:20:18,117 --> 01:20:21,996
- I think I'm going to be sick.
- Pay attention to her!

1019
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:24,248
Is she OK?

1020
01:20:24,332 --> 01:20:28,294
Yeah. She's delivering lakeside, but yeah.
Did you swim all the way here?

1021
01:20:28,377 --> 01:20:32,965
- Baker, what's going on?
- Nora's having her baby. We need a hospital.

1022
01:20:33,049 --> 01:20:35,509
- What can I do to help?
- You can help with Nora.

1023
01:20:35,593 --> 01:20:38,596
- Mark's on point. Right?
- I know the area really well.

1024
01:20:38,679 --> 01:20:42,808
Dad forced me to read topographical maps
of this area, for no apparent reason.

1025
01:20:42,892 --> 01:20:45,770
Hey, that's my boy.
Lead the way, Kenneth Murtaugh.

1026
01:20:45,853 --> 01:20:49,231
My dad has let me have
almost every animal in the world,

1027
01:20:49,315 --> 01:20:51,442
which makes me an expert on scat trails.

1028
01:20:51,525 --> 01:20:54,862
- That's my boy.
- Point us the right way, I'll find a scat trail.

1029
01:20:54,945 --> 01:20:56,906
- What's "scat"?
- Animal poop.

1030
01:20:56,989 --> 01:20:59,700
Cool, we're following poop.

1031
01:21:00,743 --> 01:21:03,913
OK, I'm a little competitive.

1032
01:21:03,996 --> 01:21:05,790
- I know.
- Go! Go!

1033
01:21:05,873 --> 01:21:09,210
- Come on, guys. This way.
- There's a road up ahead.

1034
01:21:29,772 --> 01:21:31,857
Yeah. We did it!

1035
01:21:33,567 --> 01:21:35,653
Come on, guys, this way.

1036
01:21:39,448 --> 01:21:42,368
Come on. Hurry! Come on, hurry up!

1037
01:21:46,539 --> 01:21:49,291
I'll take it from here. I got it.

1038
01:21:53,963 --> 01:21:56,924
My daughter is about to deliver
and I need to get her in.

1039
01:21:57,008 --> 01:22:01,137
I don't want her to feel any pain.
I want the baby to be healthy. Get it? Good.

1040
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:05,558
- If I could get you to fill out...
- I wouldn't mess with her if I were you, OK?

1041
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:07,351
Right.

1042
01:22:07,435 --> 01:22:10,396
- Wow.
- She's having a baby.

1043
01:22:11,522 --> 01:22:14,650
Stay calm! Can we get a chair over here?!

1044
01:22:14,734 --> 01:22:17,737
- Get me in a wheelchair.
- I need a wheelchair, stat!

1045
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,572
Get the chair!

1046
01:22:20,406 --> 01:22:22,992
- My God. My God.
- Good luck.

1047
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:33,419
It must be this way.

1048
01:22:33,502 --> 01:22:36,756
That way. All right.
Family only in the delivery room.

1049
01:22:36,839 --> 01:22:40,801
- Whoa, whoa! You're all family?
- Yes.

1050
01:22:40,885 --> 01:22:43,012
- Help me out here.
- I'm her mother.

1051
01:22:43,095 --> 01:22:45,431
- Of course.
- Kate.

1052
01:22:47,141 --> 01:22:49,226
Do your thing.

1053
01:22:51,854 --> 01:22:56,817
- OK, come on. Let's go.
- Tom, actually, we'd like Lorraine to come.

1054
01:22:56,901 --> 01:22:59,320
We want you to be the godmother.

1055
01:22:59,403 --> 01:23:01,906
Really?

1056
01:23:01,989 --> 01:23:04,325
Whoa! Having a baby here!

1057
01:23:04,408 --> 01:23:09,080
- We'll try to get you a linebacker, Tom.
- Come on, everybody. Come on.

1058
01:23:09,163 --> 01:23:11,749
This is a hospital. You guys have to be quiet.

1059
01:23:11,832 --> 01:23:13,751
Tom.

1060
01:23:13,834 --> 01:23:16,212
You mind if we wait with you?

1061
01:23:16,295 --> 01:23:18,214
That'd be great.

1062
01:23:29,642 --> 01:23:31,852
They're good kids, Jimmy. All of 'em.

1063
01:23:31,936 --> 01:23:34,480
And you're saying we have
nothing to do with it?

1064
01:23:34,563 --> 01:23:36,357
They're born hard-wired.

1065
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,359
- Look what we found.
- Check it out.

1066
01:23:38,442 --> 01:23:41,821
Hey. Just be sure and disinfect them.

1067
01:23:41,904 --> 01:23:44,949
It's a bedpan, Kenny. Take it off.

1068
01:23:45,032 --> 01:23:48,869
- So your kid gets my kid to wear a bedpan...
- I didn't tell him to do it.

1069
01:23:49,203 --> 01:23:54,625
You look in the face of a six-month-old
and that's the way they are.

1070
01:23:57,378 --> 01:24:01,424
You look like
you have something to say.

1071
01:24:01,507 --> 01:24:07,304
I'm done with the city, Dad. I'm gonna open
up my own garage and I'm moving up here.

1072
01:24:07,388 --> 01:24:09,640
And I wanna audit art classes at Madison.

1073
01:24:09,724 --> 01:24:13,269
- Pardon me?
- Dad, I wanna be an artist.

1074
01:24:13,352 --> 01:24:16,731
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1075
01:24:17,273 --> 01:24:19,400
Jimmy.

1076
01:24:21,736 --> 01:24:25,239
Although it does sound pretty exciting.

1077
01:24:30,578 --> 01:24:36,000
- Sweetheart, is this what you really want?
- I'm sure.

1078
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:40,546
You know, Annie,
I was just trying to be a good father.

1079
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,883
I know.

1080
01:24:47,178 --> 01:24:50,473
- What do you think?
- Sounds like you got your mind made up.

1081
01:24:50,556 --> 01:24:52,975
I do. You OK with that?

1082
01:24:54,935 --> 01:24:57,313
Yeah. I think I am.

1083
01:25:02,818 --> 01:25:04,904
Excuse me. Tom?

1084
01:25:07,114 --> 01:25:09,325
You wanna meet your grandson?

1085
01:25:12,286 --> 01:25:14,246
Yeah.

1086
01:25:38,646 --> 01:25:41,732
You did a good job, honey. Really good job.

1087
01:25:41,816 --> 01:25:46,237
That's a big boy. Too bad
he wasn't there to help us win the cup.

1088
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,698
He'll get a chance.

1089
01:25:48,781 --> 01:25:51,158
Mike Romanow gave me a deal.

1090
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:55,162
Now we own the big house at the lake.

1091
01:25:57,081 --> 01:26:00,292
It'll be nice having you
in the neighbourhood, Bud.

1092
01:26:00,376 --> 01:26:05,673
You Murtaughs better start cranking out
grandkids if you wanna compete.

1093
01:26:05,756 --> 01:26:09,927
You guys. My godchild is trying to snooze.

1094
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:13,222
So, any ideas on names?

1095
01:26:16,142 --> 01:26:19,562
I think we're going to go with "Tom".

1096
01:26:19,645 --> 01:26:23,899
Cos you taught us
that there's no way to be a perfect parent,

1097
01:26:23,983 --> 01:26:27,528
but a million ways to be a really good one.

1098
01:26:29,613 --> 01:26:33,075
And you're about as good as they get.

1099
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:35,244
Say hi to Grandpa.

1100
01:26:36,037 --> 01:26:37,955
Go on.

1101
01:26:47,965 --> 01:26:50,051
You're so beautiful.

1102
01:26:56,807 --> 01:26:59,435
Tom. Hey, Tom.

1103
01:27:06,067 --> 01:27:08,361
Welcome to family.

1104
01:27:40,351 --> 01:27:44,105
Letting go is the hardest thing
you can do as a parent.

1105
01:27:44,188 --> 01:27:47,984
You have to settle with the past,
engage in the present,

1106
01:27:48,067 --> 01:27:50,277
and believe in the future.

1107
01:27:50,361 --> 01:27:52,989
That vacation at Lake Winnetka
reminded Tom and me

1108
01:27:53,072 --> 01:27:59,412
that we're always learning as parents,
and that the bond is forever.

1109
01:27:59,495 --> 01:28:02,289
Even as the kids grow up
and venture out on their own,

1110
01:28:02,373 --> 01:28:06,252
we'll always be with them
and they'll always be with us.

1111
01:28:06,335 --> 01:28:10,089
Because life is a voyage
that's homeward bound.

1112
01:29:15,738 --> 01:29:18,324
Is this my normal face?

1113
01:29:20,368 --> 01:29:23,079
Hi, Poo-poo. You want a treat?

1114
01:29:29,794 --> 01:29:31,587
Can I redo that?

1115
01:29:36,384 --> 01:29:38,469
What are we gonna do?

1116
01:29:39,595 --> 01:29:44,058
She'll never walk again, I'll tell you that.

1117
