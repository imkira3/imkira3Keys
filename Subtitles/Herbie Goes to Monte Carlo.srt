00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,606
- Destination, Monsieur?
- Monte Carlo.

3
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,859
Rue, de "boisie-arie."

4
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,612
Au rue Dubec,

5
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:14,244
a droite a place "dee-l-eena."

6
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,995
Will you give it to me in English?

7
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,618
Sure. We're lost.

8
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,329
Thanks.

9
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,580
Hey.

10
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,291
- Herbie.
- What's he doing?

11
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,633
I think he's getting us un-lost.

12
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,052
Hi, there. Say,

13
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,180
we're looking for the Trans
France Race Exposition.

14
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,762
Oui, straight ahead on your right.

15
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,850
You can't miss it.

16
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,806
- That's going to be some race.
- Yeah.

17
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,850
Well, you're looking at
the winner right here.

18
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,981
This car? The winner?

19
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,031
- He didn't.
- He did.

20
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,722
All of this for the
museum payroll?

21
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,269
The most magnificent
diamond in the world.

22
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,267
L'etoile de Joie.

23
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,184
Could we have just a little peek?

24
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:31,405
On this very afternoon,
at 1:00, precisely,

25
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,202
you and all of Paris will
be able to take the peek.

26
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,170
Now, fresh from his triumphs

27
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,504
on the European racing circuit,

28
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,760
Bruno Von Stickle...

29
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,885
Who'll be driving his
laser 917 GTE coupe.

30
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,808
Here we have a
magnificent Pantera...

31
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:05,481
Ah, I see the American entry is
just arriving, Mr. Jim Douglas.

32
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:12,275
Mr. Douglas will be driving a...

33
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,072
A...

34
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:23,077
Mr. Douglas will be driving
a most unusual entry.

35
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,536
Something funny must've happened.

36
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,079
Huh. Us.

37
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,256
How about giving Jim Douglas

38
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,257
and his partner,
Wheely Applegate...

39
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,338
A nice, warm welcome, huh?

40
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:43,928
This little car of yours
is the toast of America.

41
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,229
When was your last win?

42
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,686
12 years ago.

43
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,065
That was only because,
that was our last race.

44
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,230
Yeah.

45
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,443
Yes, this race... We're kind
of staging a comeback here,

46
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,987
and so it's very important to us.

47
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,911
I mean, we won't be
coming back very far

48
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,996
unless we qualify, will we?

49
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,624
Qualify? Are you kidding?

50
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,375
Don't let his modesty

51
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,879
or this little car coming
out of retirement fool ya.

52
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,632
There isn't a finer-tuned,
cleaner engine anywhere.

53
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,717
I'm sure it should be
easy to keep clean.

54
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,141
All you have to do is

55
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,469
drop it in the washing machine
along with your socks.

56
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,187
Appreciate your humour,

57
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,688
but just don't you worry about

58
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,065
this little washing
machine... Car.

59
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,106
It's a real jewel.

60
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,785
But Monsieur Ribeaux,

61
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,075
isn't it too much
responsibility...

62
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,911
- For one man?
- One man?

63
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,081
One man and the finest
security system

64
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,416
that can be devised.

65
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,751
All in the computer.

66
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,345
Now, this alone

67
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,302
will keep the diamonds safe
from the grasp of a thief.

68
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,638
But, Monsieur, one would
only have to reach in and...

69
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,195
The pillow is sensitive
to the heat of the hand

70
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,026
when it gets close to the diamond.

71
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,536
I'm sorry, Monsieur.

72
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,226
What does that do?

73
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,354
I'm engaging a system
of electric eye beams

74
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,894
that surrounds the pedestal.

75
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,107
One last precaution, gentlemen.

76
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,567
Would you please step
out of the room?

77
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,631
Now the entire floor is a trap.

78
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,220
The mere ashes from a cigar
would activate the alarm.

79
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,161
Right on schedule.

80
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,289
Only ten steps to six
million dollars.

81
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,463
One step to Devil's Island if
anything touches that floor.

82
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,768
Pardon, Monsieur Ribeaux,

83
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,892
but you forgot to give me the
computer and the numbers.

84
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,348
I did not forget.

85
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,318
They were put in my trust
and will remain with me.

86
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:24,606
One does not part with the
only copy in existence.

87
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,996
Patience, Quincey.
Electronics is the answer.

88
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,166
This notebook is our
passport to the future.

89
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,744
I think I shall put my
trust in this bit of rope.

90
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,392
When the man has it all
worked out for us,

91
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,639
silly not to use it.

92
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,317
You had to bring the
whole kit, didn't you?

93
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,986
I was just checking
for the radar beam.

94
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,199
It's there.

95
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,202
Now it isn't.

96
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,468
Some chunk of rock?

97
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,262
One could spend a lifetime

98
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,465
without setting eyes
on a rock like that.

99
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,391
You'll love getting
your hands on it.

100
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,641
Ah.

101
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,312
Patience, Quincey.
Pillow's the trap.

102
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,106
One more set of numbers.

103
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,480
Why can't a man write an "o"
that looks like an "o"?

104
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,733
Or is it a "9"?

105
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,322
Can't take a chance.

106
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,163
I don't trust nobody.

107
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,036
I'm glad I come prepared.

108
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,077
The old ways are
still the best ways.

109
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,255
We've got six minutes
before the guard checks.

110
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,081
Get on with it.

111
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,153
Aren't you ever gonna
get that thing fixed?

112
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,405
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I...

113
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,951
- Excuse me. Oh, I just...
- Oh.

114
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,124
Jim.

115
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,642
A word to the wise.

116
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,470
Paris may be the land of love,

117
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:04,186
but it can also be the
land of heartbreak.

118
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,602
I'll tell you what I'll do.

119
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,645
I'll make a deal with you.

120
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,648
I'm willing to resist
the girls, if you are.

121
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,868
- Well, that's some sacrifice.
- I know.

122
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,953
But I'm willing to make it.

123
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,993
You're made of strong
stuff, Wheely.

124
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,003
Patience, patience, Quincey.

125
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,467
You tell that to the guard.

126
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,257
He'll be here in two minutes.

127
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,185
Give me that.

128
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,272
Well, we're coming into this
big right hand sweeper, see.

129
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,820
Dropped him into third gear
and really jumped on it.

130
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,197
Took three cars.

131
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,485
Then back into fourth,
and we were flying.

132
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,824
Tach-in' seven or eight thousand.

133
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,365
We blew off the lead car 100
yards from the finish line.

134
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,203
Won it going away. How about that?

135
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,508
Je Ne comprens pas,
parlez anglais.

136
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,965
I didn't understand
what he was saying.

137
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,049
That's okay.

138
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,778
He didn't understand what
you were saying either.

139
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,603
Come to think of it, I don't think
I understood what you were saying.

140
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,357
There's no more time.

141
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,234
That guard's practically
in the door.

142
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,187
You want that stone, don't ya?

143
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,320
Yeah, and there's only
one way to get it.

144
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,555
It's not possible.

145
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,942
Attention.

146
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,502
Attention, everyone, attention.

147
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,956
Nobody is to leave
the area. I repeat.

148
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,920
- Nobody is to leave the area.
- We still have to qualify.

149
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,504
Come on.

150
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,634
- What's the trouble?
- I don't know.

151
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,138
Ladies and gentlemen,

152
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,766
there has been a
theft in the museum.

153
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,475
Everyone will be searched
before leaving the area.

154
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,355
I repeat.

155
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,029
Nobody is to leave the area
until they have been searched.

156
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,402
Here, mate,

157
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,655
there's no point in us both
getting caught, is there?

158
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,499
No point in either of
us getting caught.

159
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:21,342
I repeat. Nobody is
to leave the area.

160
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,802
I repeat. Nobody is
to leave the area

161
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,846
until he has been searched.

162
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,031
We'll never see it again.

163
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,991
That little car there?
Indeed you can.

164
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,875
It will be in a showroom
on the Champs-Elysées

165
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,373
at 4:30 this afternoon.

166
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,798
Yes, yes, yes.

167
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,715
But are you sure all the
security precautions

168
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,757
had been taken?

169
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,719
I've searched my memory.

170
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,558
Could I have forgotten something?

171
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,231
Inspector, some residue
from a footprint.

172
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,559
I might have overlooked it,

173
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,773
but I seemed to hear
your voice calling out,

174
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,197
"Fontenoy, remember,
no clue is too small."

175
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,654
Did you also hear me saying,

176
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,237
"Take it to lab and get
it analysed, Fontenoy?"

177
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,789
Yes, sir, and I'm doing just that.

178
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,630
No.

179
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,591
No, I couldn't have
forgotten anything.

180
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,423
I am as sure the security
was on yesterday

181
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,305
as I am sure it's off today.

182
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,727
Fontenoy.

183
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,859
Attention, please.

184
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,155
The qualifying rounds will
begin in eight minutes.

185
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,044
- Douglas and Applegate.
- Douglas.

186
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,120
Ah, yes, Monsieur Douglas.

187
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,164
You're in the heat after this one.

188
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,717
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

189
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,636
That's the same heat
I'm in, Douglas.

190
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,635
And you're going to
need more than luck.

191
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,681
You're going to need wings.

192
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,603
Oh, yeah? Well, you may be
in for a little surprise.

193
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,603
I can see your surprise.

194
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,476
It is very little.

195
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,194
Attention...

196
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,869
Look for an even bigger surprise

197
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:58,953
when the race starts.

198
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,174
There will be qualifying

199
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,504
today and tomorrow,

200
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:09,340
with the top 16 times running
in the Trans France race.

201
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,756
You are not in this
heat. Come back.

202
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,432
Say, Herbie, where you going?

203
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,798
Herbie, you could get
us disqualified.

204
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,474
He could get us killed.

205
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,735
- What was that?
- I don't know.

206
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,117
Forget the music.

207
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,409
Whoa.

208
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,593
He's out of his mind.

209
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,337
He's out of his mind, all right.

210
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,885
Over that luscious little Lancia.

211
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,150
What is...

212
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,909
I'm telling you, Paris
and women have got him.

213
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,487
I'm gonna have to warn him
the same way I did you.

214
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,413
Like father, like car.

215
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,749
What are you doing?

216
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,223
- Now, wait a minute, buddy...
- What do you mean, "buddy"?

217
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,802
- Miss Buddy.
- You... You...

218
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,728
Yeah, Jim Douglas.
And I'm very sorry.

219
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,809
You think...

220
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,606
That because I'm a woman driver,

221
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,901
you can get away with
anything you please.

222
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,233
Well, I'm not a pigeon
for your fun and games.

223
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,568
I've had it with you clowns.

224
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,906
No, I'm not the clown.
Believe me, it was Herbie.

225
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,072
Oh, yes, you're blaming
your dizzy mechanic.

226
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,906
No, no, it's...

227
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,629
Herbie's the car, and
he's kinda like a person.

228
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,081
He's... now, I know
that sounds funny.

229
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,508
Crazy, is more like it.

230
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,095
Well, what were you doing
out there, Douglas?

231
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,922
Well, it's kinda hard
to explain, sir...

232
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,216
Not for me, it isn't.

233
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,009
He doesn't want a
woman in the race.

234
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:26,141
Look, Miss Darcy, you'll be given
another chance to qualify.

235
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,472
We're terribly sorry.

236
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:31,150
You're sorry, he's sorry,
everybody's sorry.

237
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,444
But I didn't qualify.

238
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,229
Attention, Antonio Vittoro.

239
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,569
If you wish to
qualify, Mr. Douglas,

240
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,109
you have exactly 10 minutes.

241
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:42,945
Hear that, Herbie?

242
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,531
You forget that powder puff
and get your mind on racing.

243
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,161
You better believe it.

244
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,329
Gilbert.

245
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,504
We're going to cook that
chicken, European-style.

246
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,880
When he sticks out his neck,

247
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,048
- we will chop it off.
- Huh. Oui, oui.

248
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,678
Jawohl, jawohl.

249
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:09,147
We'll see whose neck
gets chopped off.

250
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,726
Right, Herbie?

251
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,685
Attention, attention, attention.

252
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,602
You better close
your mouth, turkey,

253
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,350
because you're gonna
get our tire marks

254
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,181
right across your teeth.

255
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,536
- Where'd they go?
- I really got snookered.

256
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,864
I'm even rustier than I thought.

257
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,461
Hey. Herbie, what are you doing?

258
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,248
It's her again.

259
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,509
Oh, no.

260
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,898
Well, it took a crowd to do it.

261
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:41,735
But at least we lost the Lancia.

262
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:46,243
And not to mention the
first qualifying round.

263
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,046
Did you get a hold of Double X?

264
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,707
He wasn't very happy.

265
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,752
Who is? Where is that
stupid little car?

266
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,171
Patience, patience...
Oh, excuse me, sir.

267
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,881
There are impressive
racing cars here,

268
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,345
but I don't seem to see
the little Volkswagen.

269
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:12,520
Ah, you mean the Douglas
car. It will be here.

270
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,598
Patience, my friend, patience.

271
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,105
One more person says
"patience" to me, I'll...

272
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,185
We better have it now,

273
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,942
because if we don't turn
up with that diamond,

274
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,949
Double X is going to mark the
spot where we're buried.

275
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:30,075
Here, here. Don't dig
our graves just yet.

276
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,634
Come on, let's grab it.

277
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,972
- Don't tell me, "patience".
- In front of 100 witnesses?

278
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,347
We need a plan.

279
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:52,051
Attention, everyone. Attention.

280
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,932
We would like to show a film

281
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,518
of the route the
racing cars will take

282
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,065
when they leave Paris.

283
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,892
If someone will catch the lights

284
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,943
while I draw the drapes...

285
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,940
I think the gentleman
just gave us a plan.

286
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,584
The fine machines
you have seen here

287
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,341
will be among those testing
the gruelling route,

288
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,093
stretching through our fair city,

289
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,799
twisting through
the French Alps...

290
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,516
Back up slowly, as if
nothing was the matter.

291
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,189
In the city, the cars will
be able to pick up speed...

292
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,227
As they race along the
French countryside.

293
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,860
Only by the challenge

294
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,533
that becomes evident...

295
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:53,161
As we approach the
famous French Alps.

296
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,290
It's not here, max. The
car's just not here.

297
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:59,619
Will test the endurance... Of
even the sturdiest of cars.

298
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,544
Perhaps we're backing
in the wrong direction.

299
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,873
Just keep backing up.

300
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,924
There remains the final
dash for Monte Carlo.

301
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:11,847
And for someone, victory
is just a step away.

302
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,151
- Herbie. Excuse me.
- You mean, no Herbie.

303
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,751
Garcon. Garcon.

304
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,706
Garcon.

305
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,832
Excusez moi.

306
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,460
Oui.

307
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:08,511
- Etes-vous, cuckoo?
- Oui. Cuckoo.

308
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:50,891
My car. My car. Has
anybody seen my car?

309
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:55,395
- Oh, that was your car?
- Yes, yes. It's gone.

310
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:00,396
- Yes, it's gone.
- Did you see who took it?

311
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,735
Not exactly, mademoiselle.

312
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,445
Excuse me, I hate to bother you...

313
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,323
You. I should have
known I'd see you.

314
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,281
You and trouble go together.

315
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,457
Yeah, okay. Look,
we've lost our car...

316
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,626
And I'd just like to
know if you'd seen it,

317
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,702
by any chance.

318
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,917
Who cares about your
silly Volkswagen?

319
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,374
My Lancia has been stolen.

320
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,511
- Stolen?
- Your car?

321
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,882
- And your car.
- Yeah.

322
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,014
- I saw them both.
- Then you saw who stole them.

323
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:39,773
You would not believe this.
I would not believe this.

324
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,604
- No one would believe this.
- What?

325
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,733
I think they steal each other.

326
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,529
Come on.

327
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,455
Taxi.

328
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,126
Cuckoo.

329
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,541
Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Coo.

330
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,862
Talk about a needle in a haystack.

331
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,033
How are we gonna find 'em?

332
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,487
I don't know. Just keep looking.

333
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,951
My life is riding on that car.

334
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,367
Lady, I got a few
things to prove myself.

335
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,394
Where would you take a boyfriend

336
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,454
on first night to Paris?

337
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,668
"Boyfriend"?

338
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,172
Don't tell me this is your
cute way of making a pass.

339
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,505
If I had romance in mind,
would he be along?

340
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,547
Right.

341
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:56,725
- It's Herbie.
- Herbie. I don't believe this.

342
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,895
Well, it's true.

343
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,188
There's something about that car.

344
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,311
He's got a... He...

345
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,191
Well, we've been through
a lot together.

346
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,980
Yeah, well, nothing like this.

347
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,294
Hey. Regardons. Regarde.

348
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,466
Bateaux-Mouches.

349
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,223
Do you think this is
something to laugh about?

350
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,555
Forgive me, mademoiselle.
I laugh at the radio.

351
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,597
Two automobiles,

352
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,058
they take a ride on
the Bateaux-Mouches.

353
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,438
Would you believe such a thing?

354
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,939
Bateaux-Mouches?

355
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,064
Take a left at that bridge.

356
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,846
Maybe I can explain this
over dinner tonight.

357
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,267
Maybe not.

358
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:36,825
I don't know, Herbie. 12
years is a long time.

359
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,622
Hope we can handle it.

360
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,456
Hope I can handle it.

361
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,086
- Well, all taken care of, Jim.
- Yeah?

362
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:51,627
Had a little talk with Herbie.
Had to straighten him out.

363
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,929
I don't mind having a
car that's got a heart,

364
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,339
but I will not tolerate

365
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,641
a car falling in love
with another car.

366
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,135
What did you expect him to fall
in love with, the Goodyear blimp?

367
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,395
The Goodyear... Yeah.

368
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,313
Anyway, I said, "Listen Herbie,

369
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,146
"we're here for one thing only.

370
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,977
"And that's to make
the biggest comeback

371
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,361
"in racing history.

372
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,986
"So, no women in training camp.

373
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,649
"Just forget that little chick.

374
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,985
"And you can do it.

375
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,119
"Just a matter of
mind over metal."

376
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,620
- You expecting company?
- No.

377
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,255
Detective Fontenoy here.

378
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,334
And this is the famous
Inspector Bouchet.

379
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,426
I'm Jim Douglas

380
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,506
and this is my partner
Wheely Applegate.

381
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,136
Look, if there's a problem

382
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,098
about our car cruising on
the Bateaux-Mouches...

383
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,929
Bateaux-Mouches? No, no.

384
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,685
It's about the six
million dollar diamond

385
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:46,894
stolen this morning.

386
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,317
Perhaps the most beautiful
diamond in all the world.

387
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,351
Fontenoy.

388
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:51,694
No?

389
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,197
We are questioning everyone

390
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,278
who was in the area at the time.

391
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,359
Perhaps you can help us.

392
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:26,146
Pushing the car won't
help me get the cap off.

393
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,476
- Must've rolled.
- Well, pull the hand brake on.

394
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,784
Door's locked.

395
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,110
The window.

396
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,037
Put your hand through the window.

397
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,292
Ooh.

398
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,094
Let me get at it.

399
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,929
I'm gonna hotwire this car.

400
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,631
We'll get the diamond
at the garage.

401
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,933
Right.

402
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,223
Well, I'm not waiting.

403
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,560
Car, it's either you... Or me.

404
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,277
Oof.

405
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,964
I suppose you're going to tell me

406
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,784
that car started up and
drove away by itself.

407
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,963
No, and I'm not going to
tell Double X that either.

408
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,365
What's happening?

409
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,287
There's seven cars ahead of us

410
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,169
and we're in last place.
That's what's happening.

411
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,501
- Darcy.
- Oui. Qualifying today?

412
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,340
I hope so.

413
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,514
New Herbie? He's not
even an old Herbie.

414
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,186
He's not any Herbie at all.

415
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,310
My whole lecture must've
fallen on a deaf carburettor.

416
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,260
He doesn't need a lecture.
He needs an old-age pension.

417
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:37,352
You listen to me, Herbie,
and you listen good.

418
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,812
You and I didn't come
out of moth balls

419
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,231
to be the laughingstock
of the continent.

420
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,784
Either get the lead out
of your pants right now,

421
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,361
or I'm going to ship you
back to the states,

422
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,287
have you stuffed
and hung on a wall

423
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,240
in Retirement Village.

424
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,222
Ah.

425
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:20,070
Ooh. Now you're talking. We
got the old Herbie back.

426
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,398
The old Herbie and the new
Herbie, rolled into one.

427
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,924
I'm telling you,
it's the old Herbie,

428
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,468
and he's doing it for us.

429
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,439
He's not doing it for us.

430
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,771
He's doing it for her.

431
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,289
Okay, so he did it for her.

432
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,548
I never saw anything like that.

433
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,474
- Congratulations, you did it.
- Thank you, thank you.

434
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,806
- Somebody did it.
- Who cares, Wheely?

435
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:38,973
It's, "Hello, comeback."

436
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,608
In record time for this track.

437
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,518
You shattered Von Stickle's mark.

438
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:44,479
Congratulations, Douglas.

439
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,907
You have just won the right
to taste my dust tomorrow.

440
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,780
And mine, Douglas.

441
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,616
Today, you break my record.

442
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,908
Tomorrow, I will turn
your "Hello, comeback"

443
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,914
into "Goodbye forever."

444
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,586
Auf wiedersehen.

445
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,000
Couple of charm school dropouts.

446
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,085
Yeah.

447
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,231
Well, one showboat
deserves another.

448
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,150
I'll go get him.

449
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,580
Félicitations.

450
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,871
Absolutely amazing.

451
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,286
I knew I had a good
car under me, but...

452
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,371
The exact same time
as the Douglas car.

453
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,630
- A track record.
- What?

454
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,333
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

455
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,760
Oh, thank you for
staying off the track.

456
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,509
It's one way I can
prove what I can do.

457
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,932
Well, it wasn't exactly you.

458
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,725
You've got a real problem

459
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,601
about women in
racing, Mr. Douglas.

460
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,605
What is it? We drive too
slow... Or too fast?

461
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,478
Oh, I didn't mean that.

462
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,935
It's not you at
all, it's your car.

463
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,437
And my car.

464
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,276
Excuse me, I don't want
to hear about your car.

465
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,356
No, I have to tell you this.

466
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,442
I know it's gonna be
hard to believe, but...

467
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,404
You see, Herbie's not just a car.

468
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,036
I didn't believe it
myself at first,

469
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,117
but the little guy has
actually got a...

470
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,752
He's...

471
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,257
When a car like Herbie
comes to Paris,

472
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,668
he meets a beautiful Lancia,

473
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,378
that is also a car like Herbie,

474
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,929
with a, with a...

475
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,977
You know, it's natural that
they're gonna fall in...

476
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,232
You're right.

477
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,440
I wouldn't believe it either.

478
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:32,651
When the men come by
from the booby hatch,

479
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,323
go quietly.

480
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,496
Just trying to warn
you about your car.

481
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,203
Let me warn you about me.

482
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:47,082
I'm in this race to win, and
frankly, I'd like to see...

483
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,836
You and your car
disappear entirely.

484
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,798
Oh.

485
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,034
Quincey.

486
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:23,160
Pull over. We want that car.

487
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,247
What are you going to do?

488
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,413
I'm gonna pull over.

489
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,936
Hang on.

490
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,429
Darkness is about
to fall upon you.

491
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,018
Amazing.

492
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,398
Whoa.

493
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,954
Hot, hot, hot.

494
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,960
You...

495
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,421
They're still coming.

496
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,961
I think they are
trying to kill us.

497
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:09,262
Mon dieu. Mon die...

498
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,999
I never thought she'd go that far

499
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,372
to make us disappear.

500
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,919
Who's that?

501
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,497
That cute little time bomb, Diane.

502
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,457
She set us up to knock
us out of the race,

503
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:39,591
just like she said.

504
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,886
Now, wait a minute.
She didn't say that.

505
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,510
Oh, of course not. They
never say what they mean.

506
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,386
That's what makes the
female of the species

507
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,012
deadlier than the male.

508
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:50,724
You read that some place.

509
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,931
Yes, and I've got a
mother, three sisters

510
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,936
and two ex-wives to prove it.

511
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,983
They never told me
they wanted me out,

512
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,315
but every time I came home,
the lock was changed.

513
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,946
I don't take that kind
of strong-arm stuff

514
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,524
from anybody, male or female.

515
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,318
Then somebody better
teach this female

516
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,451
the rules of the game...

517
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,574
Before the game is over.

518
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,700
If she doesn't know 'em now,

519
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,032
she will when I get
through with her.

520
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,543
You might as well
settle back, Herbie.

521
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:17,547
Once Jim gets started,
nothing can stop him.

522
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,923
Who hired thugs?

523
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:21,672
I'm just as good as anybody
out there on that track.

524
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,549
And I don't need anybody
to win my races for me.

525
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,629
We...

526
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:28,057
That is the trouble
with you, all of you.

527
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,720
You don't think a woman
can do anything.

528
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,772
Yeah, I know he seems
like a quiet sort of guy,

529
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:38,943
but when a fight is
inevitable, he never ducks.

530
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,109
"Women are supposed to be nurses

531
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:46,318
"and secretaries and
school teachers."

532
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,027
I've taken that all my life.

533
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:51,242
I took it from my
mother and my father.

534
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,166
And my aunts and my uncles.

535
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:58,621
But I'm not going to
take it from you.

536
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,425
When old Jim gets started,
I hate to get in his way.

537
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,461
He's a regular steamroller.

538
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:07,304
- Whoa.
- Coward.

539
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:11,600
I'm a race driver and I
can win it on my own.

540
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,351
Oh.

541
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,102
You know, I think you can.

542
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,228
Double X? Yeah.

543
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:27,032
I'm afraid we-we-we've had
another complication.

544
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,869
I'm beginning to think you
are the complication.

545
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,580
That...

546
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,207
That item should have
been in my hands by now.

547
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,671
Oh, don't worry, sir. It's
still in the gas tank.

548
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,750
Then bring me the gas tank.
What are you waiting for?

549
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:47,136
We've lost them again, sir.
We don't know where they are.

550
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,721
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Inspector Bouchet.

551
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,390
Oui, Monsieur.

552
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,591
Impossible.

553
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:53,930
Are you trying to tell me

554
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,847
a couple of simpleminded
Americans...

555
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:58,806
Ah...

556
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,068
- Disappeared?
- Hold on.

557
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,692
Hope we're not disturbing
you, Inspector.

558
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,318
No, gentlemen.

559
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,527
Your timing could not
be more perfect.

560
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,656
Good.

561
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,784
I want to thank you for your
continued cooperation...

562
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,870
In this matter of
the stolen diamond.

563
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:19,327
Tonight, we're asking
for your help.

564
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,287
Somebody's out to get our car.

565
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,330
Ah, that's impossible.

566
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,337
I think they're trying to
knock us out of the race.

567
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,344
I was wondering if there's
some way, I don't know,

568
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,847
we can put the car in
protective custody

569
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,881
for the night.

570
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,601
That is, if you're not too busy
trying to find that diamond.

571
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:36,677
No, no.

572
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,063
One is just as important as
the other, I assure you.

573
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,482
I'll only be a moment.

574
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,200
Oh. I mean...

575
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,871
- We'll wait in the car.
- Good idea.

576
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:58,707
We wouldn't want anything
to happen to it.

577
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,038
Not now.

578
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:07,007
Hello. The car is here.

579
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,169
Never mind how...

580
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,257
Never mind how.

581
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,548
No, no. It's too risky for me.

582
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:16,308
I will see to it that the
car will be at number 32,

583
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,761
Avenue Mozart within the hour.

584
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,729
Don't get lost on the way.

585
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:36,871
Your worry is now my worry,
gentlemen. Rest easily.

586
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:40,283
I'll take personal charge of
this valuable possession.

587
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,710
- Inspector.
- What is it, Fontenoy?

588
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,587
Off duty or not, sir,

589
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,669
I couldn't sleep, thinking
about the diamond...

590
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,295
And how it would be
weighing on your mind.

591
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,877
At the moment, Fontenoy,

592
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,546
I have a car weighing on my mind.

593
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,931
Somebody's trying to knock
us out of the race.

594
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,134
Well, with your excellent
time in the trials,

595
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,060
it would not take a
master of deduction

596
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,266
like Inspector Bouchet...

597
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,188
To see that you have an
excellent chance to win.

598
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,937
Which is why I
personally will ensure

599
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,984
the safety of this automobile.

600
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:13,195
Now, put your minds at ease.
Get a good night's sleep.

601
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,901
Thank you. You too, Herbie.

602
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,120
A big day tomorrow, pal.

603
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,163
- Good night.
- Good night.

604
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,913
- No, no. Permit me, sir.
- What do you mean?

605
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,294
You have enough responsibility
trying to find the diamond.

606
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,043
- I'll look after the car.
- Don't be ridiculous.

607
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,880
What are you doing?

608
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,091
Anything for you and the force.

609
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,805
Get out of the car.

610
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:44,726
Leave it to me, sir.

611
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,900
I'll keep this little car
hidden so no one will find it.

612
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,244
Fontenoy...

613
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,202
My best man.

614
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,128
Huh.

615
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,334
- Good night.
- Good night.

616
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:18,714
My very best.

617
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,846
We've checked that,
sir. It's nowhere.

618
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,932
We've covered the
whole city. Now what?

619
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:32,069
In the morning, before the race,

620
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:35,523
that ridiculous little
car will get gasoline.

621
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:38,443
When it does, you'll be there.

622
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,618
Welcome, everyone,

623
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:44,244
to the inaugural running
of the Trans France race.

624
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:45,620
They're all here:

625
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,793
qualifying drivers and
cars from the world over,

626
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,711
each looking forward, expectantly,

627
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,630
for the chance at the
magnificent trophy...

628
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,082
And the $20,000
winner-take-all prize.

629
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,211
This promises to be one of the
most punishing races ever.

630
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,422
And these drivers know it.

631
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,428
They've no doubt gone
through these cars,

632
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,384
time after time after time.

633
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:04,684
And yet, we have them all here,

634
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,642
still refining and
tuning car after car,

635
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,894
each preparing for the
gruelling race...

636
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:13,562
That will test the endurance
of man and machine.

637
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,446
I just wish I had a
machine to test.

638
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,565
I hope, what's-his-name

639
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,822
didn't hide Herbie so
well, he can't find him.

640
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:24,201
I wish you hadn't said that.
I mean, I'm a mechanic.

641
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,832
And a mechanic is nothing
without his car.

642
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:28,750
A million and one details

643
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,661
have to be taken
care of for a race.

644
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:34,339
You know me, how I pride
myself on being thorough.

645
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,293
My tools. Where's my tools.

646
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,131
Right here.

647
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,642
- I knew that.
- Huh.

648
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,022
Inspector, the race is about
to begin. Where's our car?

649
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:56,354
Believe me, I am as
concerned as you are.

650
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,438
But I'm sure Fontenoy
will be here.

651
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,201
He's unpredictable,
but he's dependable.

652
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,368
What?

653
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:06,788
Let me check headquarters again.

654
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,127
He'll be here.

655
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,674
You be ready.

656
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,137
Who's that?

657
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,182
He's Double X, you dummy.

658
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:30,930
Oh, better duck.
Here comes trouble.

659
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,143
Hello.

660
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,063
Hello.

661
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:41,612
- Look, about last night.
- I know. Me too.

662
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,820
Sorry.

663
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,994
Not about missing me
with that vase, I hope.

664
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,663
No, no.

665
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,162
I guess I was a little
uptight last night.

666
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,542
Nervous about the race.

667
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:57,130
Yeah, yeah. Well, I threw
a few brick bats myself.

668
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,211
In the wrong direction.

669
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:01,211
We didn't get off to a
flying start, did we?

670
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:06,432
Herbie and I take a
little getting used to.

671
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:12,013
When you keep including
Herbie like that,

672
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,681
you take a lot of getting used to.

673
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:21,029
By the way, where is... it?

674
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,524
- Well, I...
- Douglas,

675
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,951
did you misplace your little car?

676
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,696
Just temporarily.

677
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,866
You should look under a rock
or two. You might find it.

678
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,160
No, not under a rock, Gilbert.

679
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,545
Under a gravestone.

680
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,581
Attention, everyone.

681
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,884
All drivers, bring your
machines to the grid.

682
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,212
Five minutes 'til race time.

683
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,138
It's just as well, Douglas.

684
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:51,476
You know the saying,
"They never come back."

685
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,148
- Well, I better go.
- Diane.

686
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,531
Good luck.

687
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,943
I think you mean that.

688
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:11,747
Drivers will please
take your position...

689
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,703
As quickly as possible.

690
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:18,393
- Well, take the brake off.
- The brake is off.

691
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,979
You know something?

692
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,984
That Lancia's waiting on Herbie.

693
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:26,488
Well, so are we, and all we
need is her hanging around.

694
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,575
All right. Push it, push it.

695
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,991
- No, mademoiselle.
- Listen, I...

696
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,698
I hope you had nothing
to do with this.

697
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,499
I didn't, but I think I
can tell you who did.

698
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,497
I know, it's your Herbie.

699
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,161
That's right. Herbie's missing

700
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,422
and your Lancia's missing Herbie.

701
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,716
You must think I'm
an absolute fool

702
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,010
with this "Herbie,
Herbie, Herbie."

703
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:51,840
Well, I don't believe in fairy
tales or Herbie or you.

704
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:55,176
Jim, pop the hood, will ya?

705
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,559
What are you doing?

706
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,767
You want your car
started, don't ya?

707
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,904
Listen, I know how you feel,

708
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,361
but you better get
over it right now.

709
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,779
Forget Herbie.

710
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,035
You know why he isn't
here, don't you?

711
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,667
He's found somebody
else, that's why.

712
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,795
He didn't have the guts to tell
you himself, so I'm telling you.

713
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:27,962
Oh, yeah, we're talking about
the same guy, all right.

714
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:32,592
Old Herbie. Old fun-loving,
fickle, Herbie.

715
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:38,310
Now you see him,

716
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,058
now you don't.

717
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,889
He's right, you know.

718
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,690
So far, we've had to
tell this to a Fiat,

719
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:46,146
a Thunderbird and
an Austin-Healey.

720
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:48,320
I know how you feel. It's...

721
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,652
Fun while it lasted, but...

722
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,868
You know, the truth is,
you weren't the first

723
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,244
and you won't be the last.

724
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:01,245
You might as well take off.

725
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:07,255
Will somebody help
me start my car?

726
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,003
Yes Miss.

727
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:13,921
Please. Let me have a look.

728
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:17,432
Thank you.

729
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,512
No problem.

730
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:19,684
I was beginning to think

731
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,761
everybody around here was crazy.

732
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,523
Well, so much for the Lancia.

733
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,950
Yeah. So much for both
of them, I guess.

734
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,333
Douglas, let's go.

735
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,164
Don't you realise you've
got pole position?

736
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,170
I also realise we
don't have a car.

737
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,126
But it'll be here.

738
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,588
It'd better be. In two
minutes, Douglas,

739
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,506
or you can try again next year.

740
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,430
Mesdames et monsieurs...

741
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,268
Ladies and gentlemen,

742
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:14,986
the first running of the
Trans France race...

743
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:16,821
Is about to begin.

744
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,552
What's that?

745
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,604
It's an armoured truck.

746
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,900
That armoured truck is us.

747
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:36,070
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes. Yes.

748
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,123
Where's Herbie? Are you crazy?

749
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,461
We're supposed to be in a race,

750
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,585
and here you are guarding
the Bank of England...

751
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,045
Or the crown jewels
or who knows what.

752
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,051
We didn't travel 6,000 miles

753
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,758
just to see some French pastry

754
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,342
dressed up like a tin soldier.

755
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,299
I'll tell you something. I've
had it with the French...

756
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,760
The men, women and the...

757
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,436
Herbie?

758
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,108
Are we still in it?

759
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:19,352
From the looks of it, you'll be

760
01:04:19,353 --> 01:04:20,816
starting and finishing
in last place.

761
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,869
Quickly, you've no time to lose.
You have things to attend to.

762
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,949
- Gas. Let's move it, Wheely.
- Check. Top of my list.

763
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,962
Fill it up.

764
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,798
Monsieur Douglas, stop.

765
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,762
What do you mean, stop?

766
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,973
The tank is full. I
filled it this morning.

767
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,097
Let's go, Wheely.

768
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:03,783
Come on, Herbie. What're you
doing? The race is back there.

769
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,569
I know what he's doing.
He can't fool me.

770
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,325
He's looking for that Lancia.

771
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,494
Inspector.

772
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,495
Well, what I was
going to say, sir...

773
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,504
Suppose there was a connection

774
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,502
between the men who attacked

775
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,338
and the men who stole the diamond.

776
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:21,422
Not now, Fontenoy.

777
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:24,755
But, sir, what if they've hidden
the stolen diamond in the car?

778
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,975
- What?
- If I may suggest, sir,

779
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,511
we should have our men
search that car immediately.

780
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:32,850
- Search?
- Yes.

781
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,525
- There is no time.
- The car is still here.

782
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,601
Yes?

783
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:45,033
Yes, but it is obviously...

784
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,034
Tuning up, or something.

785
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,037
Just say the word,
and the men and I...

786
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,202
Will search that car
from bumper to bumper.

787
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,587
The word is no, Fontenoy.

788
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,039
No?

789
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,713
What you don't seem to
understand is that,

790
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:10,012
a thorough search would
take over an hour.

791
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,552
And an hour's delay
would deprive Douglas

792
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,062
of winning a race...

793
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:17,725
He has travelled halfway
around the globe to enter.

794
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:23,070
Sir, I admire you for
your consideration.

795
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:27,322
And I understand now exactly
how you are thinking.

796
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,247
Sorry, sir.

797
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:39,083
Forget the Lancia,
Herbie. She's gone.

798
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,168
You heard him right. Gone, split.

799
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,008
Yeah, that's right.

800
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:55,766
She took off in that race
like you never existed.

801
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,933
She wanted me to tell you,
it was fun while it lasted,

802
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:03,566
but when push came to
shove, she shoved off.

803
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:05,822
That's just the way women are.

804
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,407
Might as well face it.

805
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:12,196
You've been deserted,
jilted. Abandoned.

806
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,735
Too late now.

807
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:13,616
We'll get it in Monte
Carlo after the race.

808
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:27,084
Inspector, I think you
will be proud of me.

809
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,966
What now, Fontenoy?

810
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,759
I have done exactly what I knew

811
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,302
you would have wanted me to...

812
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,597
notified Monte Carlo.

813
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:41,599
Their police will search the
car as soon as it arrives.

814
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,606
I'll take care at once, sir.

815
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:17,277
Whoa.

816
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:37,878
Catch anything?

817
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:42,048
I didn't think so.

818
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:44,885
- Which way?
- Right.

819
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:52,649
Left.

820
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,834
Hope they get that
trophy to Monte Carlo

821
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:21,086
on a fast jet. We
may beat 'em to it.

822
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:24,044
Unfortunately, somebody
put the Alps in our way.

823
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,529
The way Herbie's flying,
nothing can stop him,

824
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,564
including the Himalayas.

825
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:34,765
Some road. It's not
even on the map.

826
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,342
Maybe you oughta ask directions.

827
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:37,927
From who, a French mountain goat?

828
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,262
There must be somebody.

829
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:58,330
Wheely, you...

830
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,540
Maybe I'll just call from in here.

831
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:04,703
Yeah.

832
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:19,847
Hey, there's somebody out there.

833
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:27,477
No, that's just me. I never
heard a real echo before.

834
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:33,236
Will you sit down, Wheely?

835
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,783
Just one more, okay?

836
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:45,078
Come on, Wheely.

837
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,191
I got somebody.

838
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:20,662
Those are the guys who
were after Herbie.

839
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,497
Get out of the car.

840
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:44,186
- I'm taking over.
- I'll drive the car.

841
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,650
If it worked once, maybe
it'll work again.

842
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:13,007
Hey, buddy, I like your
"yodel-ay-hee-oo".

843
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:57,422
Well, we're back on the beam.

844
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,970
How many cars you
figure are ahead of us?

845
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,922
Would you believe all of 'em?

846
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:07,136
Is that a knocking I
hear in the gas tank?

847
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,273
Not in my gas tank. Never.

848
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:15,144
Sounds like something
clunking around in there.

849
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:18,071
Well, we either listen
to the driver...

850
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:20,733
And stop to take the
gas tank apart,

851
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:24,244
or we listen to the mechanic
and try to win this race.

852
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:26,906
Well, I'm listening
to the mechanic.

853
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,244
Let's go, Herbie.

854
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:37,226
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

855
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,311
The oil pressure's up,
there's plenty of gas.

856
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:41,363
But he's not getting it.

857
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,629
I hate to mention this again,
but I heard some clunking...

858
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:04,011
You mean that nonsense
about the gas tank again?

859
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,300
Yeah, that's...

860
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,010
All right, let's get it
straight, once and for all,

861
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,175
who the mechanic is
around here, okay?

862
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:10,684
You say it's the gas tank,

863
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,682
and I say it isn't the gas tank.

864
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,894
You see? It isn't the gas tank.

865
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:18,858
It's this... Rock that
was in the gas tank.

866
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,988
Hold it.

867
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:27,368
There's only one kind of rock
that glistens like that.

868
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:28,695
Well, sure, quartz.

869
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:31,534
You can find millions of 'em
around any quarry in Philly.

870
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,078
But... Not one that's worth...

871
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:37,540
Six million bucks.

872
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:41,382
- Huh?
- L'etoile de Joie.

873
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:43,633
The tall, the what?

874
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:45,719
Etoile de Joie.

875
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:49,381
Oh, wow.

876
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:50,970
That's...

877
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:52,888
That's the biggest hunk of diamond

878
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:54,599
I've ever seen in my life.

879
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,555
What I don't understand
is how it...

880
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:58,891
The black sedan.

881
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,648
- Huh? Where?
- No, no, no.

882
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,570
They're the ones that
robbed the museum.

883
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:05,022
Don't you see?

884
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:06,736
They weren't trying to
knock us out of the race.

885
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,738
They were trying to get this.

886
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:11,995
Thank you for helping us,
gentlemen, and up with your hands.

887
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,283
You gave us the slip
for the last time.

888
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:19,128
We'll take the rock.

889
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:21,171
I don't suppose you'd
believe that was just a

890
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,714
big hunk of quartz.

891
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:26,753
The rock. Let me have it.

892
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:05,624
Ha-ha-ha.

893
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:11,180
The rock. Well, come
on, hand it over.

894
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,570
Oh. Oh.

895
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:31,408
Ooh. Ooh.

896
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:38,574
Well, what do we do with them now?

897
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,675
Thanks, Herbie. We tie 'em up.

898
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:17,204
Double X, we lost them.

899
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:20,244
First time we've ever
been done in by a car.

900
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:23,248
The goods will be in Monte Carlo

901
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:24,704
in a couple of hours.

902
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:26,918
No chance of stopping them.

903
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:31,135
See, we... We're rather
tied up at the moment.

904
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:38,058
Get me the airport.

905
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,930
We passed every car on the road.

906
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,597
All except the Lancia.

907
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:27,312
Well, after the way
she jilted Herbie,

908
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:30,065
that's one car he won't
wanna come in second to.

909
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,649
Right, Herbie?

910
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,447
Hey, isn't that it?

911
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:37,821
It sure is.

912
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:40,912
Maybe we should've stopped.

913
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:42,869
Stop? Are you kidding?

914
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:44,450
Throw away 100 grand

915
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,786
and the biggest
comeback of our lives?

916
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,165
We've got this thing.
We're a shoe-in.

917
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:50,797
- She's in trouble.
- Well, sure,

918
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:51,964
plenty of cars get in trouble.

919
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,088
Let the rescue boys bail her out.

920
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:57,379
Yeah, but I mean, she
could be in real danger.

921
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,347
I'm sorry, Wheely.

922
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:04,724
Sometimes a comeback comes second.

923
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:11,230
Herbie doesn't seem to think so.

924
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:15,981
Well, yeah, sure. Why should
Herbie want to stop...

925
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,945
After the lies you
told him back there?

926
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,370
Yeah, the jilted lover.

927
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,956
Why, if he knew that
that little Lancia...

928
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:34,921
Had been waiting on him
at the starting line,

929
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,718
wouldn't even budge...

930
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:40,047
Until you lied to her about
him throwing her over...

931
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:43,433
I mean, she... Why, he'd...

932
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,852
I mean, he'd be back
at her side right now.

933
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:52,024
I hate to say this, Jim,

934
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,319
but you got a big
mouth. You know that?

935
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,158
Hang on, Diane.

936
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:24,966
Thank you.

937
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:32,896
Thank you.

938
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:35,231
- Thank you.
- You okay?

939
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:39,657
I think so. I missed a
shift and lost control.

940
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:42,075
That's not all you could've lost.

941
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:45,912
Herbie, what're you doing?

942
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:47,823
Herbie, there's no time.

943
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,829
Forget it, Wheely.

944
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:53,621
He's gonna get his
girlfriend out of the mud.

945
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:58,921
And us out of the race.

946
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:02,922
I see it, but I don't believe it.

947
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:16,606
Well, you can believe this,
we are now out of the money,

948
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:19,567
because "Sometimes a
comeback comes second."

949
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:22,733
Who's giving up, buddy? Not me.

950
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:25,285
- Come on, you come with us.
- No, no, I...

951
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:27,195
I'm gonna stay with my car.

952
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,158
Looks like we're all
gonna stay with her car.

953
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:43,253
Let's go, Wheely.

954
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,804
You're not going any
place, are you?

955
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:07,827
Herbie?

956
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:11,073
Now listen to me.

957
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:15,119
Herbie, I know just how you feel,

958
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:18,209
but I also know
you're not a quitter.

959
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,925
Now show 'em you
can do it, Herbie.

960
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:26,013
Win it for them.

961
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:27,847
And for her.

962
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:32,139
Oh, hey.

963
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:34,054
The rest is up to you.

964
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:36,352
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

965
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,814
Aw, come on, Herbie.

966
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:42,525
Open up, will ya? Come on.

967
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:44,106
I know you're sore

968
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:46,533
about what I told you,
but I'm sorry, okay?

969
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:50,070
Look, I did it for you.

970
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,199
Okay, okay, I did it for us.

971
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:57,744
What do you want me to do,
get down on my knees?

972
01:30:57,827 --> 01:31:00,922
Okay.

973
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:03,967
All right, I lied to
ya, and I'm sorry.

974
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:07,888
And I promise I'll never,
never do it again, okay?

975
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:12,642
Boy, you sure don't
forgive easy, do ya?

976
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:30,911
Bouchet, did you miss a turn on
your way to the Eiffel Tower?

977
01:31:30,986 --> 01:31:35,082
No. A little unfinished
business, Emile.

978
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:36,583
You've wounded me, my friend.

979
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:39,745
You think I cannot handle
a little diamond search?

980
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:41,080
Five of my best men

981
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:42,960
are waiting for the cars
to enter Monte Carlo.

982
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,258
- That is exactly why I'm here.
- A-ha.

983
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,836
Afraid I will steal
some of your glory?

984
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,388
There is no glory to be stolen.

985
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:53,096
I wish to rectify a
terrible mistake...

986
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:55,682
And save everyone
from embarrassment.

987
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,898
- The search is off.
- Off?

988
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:02,859
The message was an error

989
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:04,936
by another zealous
young detective,

990
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,569
anxious to make an overnight
reputation for himself.

991
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:09,945
Ah, yes,

992
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:12,452
but for this kind of news
they invented the telephone.

993
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:13,574
Ooh-la-la.

994
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:16,160
This is a matter that needed
my personal attention.

995
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,080
Who knows what
complications could arise

996
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:21,165
from a situation like this?

997
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:24,502
This is a big race.

998
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:28,302
It could cause... An
international incident.

999
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:35,554
Ah.

1000
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:42,475
Well, it, seems your
young man in Paris...

1001
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:45,527
Has caused you a lot of trouble.

1002
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:47,400
I assure you, Emile,

1003
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:49,652
I intend to put an end to it.

1004
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:52,776
Wiser heads are always called upon

1005
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,660
to clean up the
mistakes of the young.

1006
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:57,323
- It's true.
- And our reward,

1007
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,242
we get it when we reach heaven.

1008
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:03,749
Perhaps a bit sooner.

1009
01:34:19,946 --> 01:34:21,914
Three down and two to go.

1010
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:29,808
Dirty road hog.

1011
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:31,396
Why doesn't he learn how to drive?

1012
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,399
He knows how to drive.
That's the trouble.

1013
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:44,114
Yeah, I see what you mean.

1014
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:23,995
If we don't get him
by the tunnel...

1015
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:37,543
There's no way we can pass him.

1016
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:41,550
Bruno was right. They
never come back.

1017
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,723
Herbie.

1018
01:37:11,034 --> 01:37:14,755
Ha-ha. I don't b... believe it.

1019
01:37:22,045 --> 01:37:24,798
We did it.

1020
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:26,428
They don't come back, huh?

1021
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:28,430
I guess Herbie wasn't listening.

1022
01:37:28,468 --> 01:37:30,596
- Whoo.
- Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

1023
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:31,933
Ha-ha.

1024
01:37:32,972 --> 01:37:34,269
Swine.

1025
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:39,479
Herbie. Herbie.

1026
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:41,405
Herbie. Herbie.

1027
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:49,205
Herbie. Herbie.

1028
01:37:49,489 --> 01:37:52,163
How does it feel to be back
in the winner's circle?

1029
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:53,538
Pretty good.

1030
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:57,122
Well, for the 20th time,
it was a great race,

1031
01:37:57,163 --> 01:37:58,506
and we enjoyed every
minute of it...

1032
01:37:58,581 --> 01:37:59,958
Almost every minute of it.

1033
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,252
Well, I'm enjoying
every minute of this,

1034
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:03,795
I can tell you that.

1035
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:08,975
And, both of us would
like to thank you all

1036
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:10,643
very, very much.

1037
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:15,311
Au revoir. Arrivederci.

1038
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:17,271
Ciao. Buenas noches.

1039
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:25,491
Sayonara.

1040
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:27,660
Right. See ya around, Douglas.

1041
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,337
Hey, that's some
cute little memento

1042
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:40,507
you got there, old buddy.

1043
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,174
Well, this little memento's

1044
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:43,926
as much yours as mine, old buddy.

1045
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:45,469
And it's more Herbie's
than anybody's.

1046
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,426
You can say that again.

1047
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:50,850
Well, look who's here.

1048
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:53,428
May I add my congratulations.

1049
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:55,020
You'll congratulate us even more

1050
01:38:55,021 --> 01:38:56,765
when you see what
we've got for ya.

1051
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:58,887
It was right in Herbie's gas tank.

1052
01:38:58,888 --> 01:38:59,888
Ah.

1053
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:02,653
This whatcha been looking for?

1054
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:03,688
Yes.

1055
01:39:05,523 --> 01:39:07,491
It's had a rough trip, hasn't it?

1056
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:09,448
But it's winding up
in the right hands.

1057
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:12,447
Indeed, it is.

1058
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:14,407
Don't know how we missed
connections, sir,

1059
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:15,992
but here I am.

1060
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:17,953
Fontenoy.

1061
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:23,049
You see? I knew the
diamond would be found.

1062
01:39:23,124 --> 01:39:24,592
It's an honour to be at your side

1063
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:26,590
in this moment of
triumph, Inspector.

1064
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,973
And I have more good news, sir.

1065
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:33,471
The two thieves
have been captured.

1066
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:36,679
Good.

1067
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:39,812
Good. Then I'd say the
case is concluded.

1068
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:42,019
Yeah.

1069
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:45,067
But, you know, there seems
there'd be a mastermind

1070
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:46,606
behind this kind of thing.

1071
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:47,941
Yeah, or that museum

1072
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,571
has some pretty lousy security.

1073
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:52,203
Sir, men have been
challenged to a duel

1074
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:53,738
for such an accusation.

1075
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,244
The museum's security was
virtually foolproof.

1076
01:39:56,908 --> 01:39:59,161
I made an interesting
discovery just today, sir.

1077
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:01,541
- Fontenoy...
- From the sensitised floor...

1078
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:03,206
to the radar beam
surrounding the pedestal

1079
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:06,091
to the very pillow on
which the diamond rested,

1080
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:09,171
all the traps were conceived
and executed by one man.

1081
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:10,425
- Fontenoy.
- No, sir.

1082
01:40:10,463 --> 01:40:12,261
Give credit where credit is due.

1083
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:14,926
The combinations to the
entire security system

1084
01:40:14,967 --> 01:40:18,096
were devised and
known only to you.

1085
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:22,188
The only question is, who
besides the inspector

1086
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:24,519
knew the details of
these precautions?

1087
01:40:28,606 --> 01:40:30,449
Who besides the Inspector?

1088
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:37,206
The answer to that question is...

1089
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:40,163
Nobody.

1090
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:43,829
My retirement has been
delayed too long.

1091
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:47,254
Now I hope no one will be
foolish enough to make a move.

1092
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:52,764
Move this ridiculous car, or
I'll be forced to kill you.

1093
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:54,014
Ah.

1094
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:01,309
Even a mastermind can be
outsmarted by this car.

1095
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,399
Thanks, Herbie.

1096
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:08,980
Inspector.

1097
01:41:21,617 --> 01:41:22,664
I always hoped

1098
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:25,501
you'd be present when I cracked
my first big case, sir.

1099
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:29,092
Fontenoy.

1100
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:31,635
Excuse me, sir.

1101
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:35,344
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

1102
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:38,847
I think you'll find it's
all here, Monsieur.

1103
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:40,686
I'm so happy.

1104
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,188
I personally will see to it

1105
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:48,690
that this magnificent automobile

1106
01:41:48,728 --> 01:41:51,607
receives the greatest
honour France can bestow.

1107
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:17,097
Please, the, VW?

1108
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:18,925
VW.

1109
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:23,934
Yes, the VW. The white one
with the 53 on the side.

1110
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:25,560
Yes, yes, I know the car.

1111
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:28,146
It is the toast of
all Monte Carlo.

1112
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:31,695
Yes. It's also our transportation,
if you wouldn't mind.

1113
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:34,858
Oh, I wouldn't mind, Monsieur,
but it is no longer here.

1114
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:38,360
What?

1115
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:41,072
It was stolen.

1116
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:45,834
Mademoiselle, you would
not believe this.

1117
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:48,583
I would not believe this.

1118
01:42:48,621 --> 01:42:50,294
No one would believe this.

1119
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:53,501
It was stolen...

1120
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:55,086
By another car.

1121
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:02,765
I know that you
believe about Herbie,

1122
01:43:02,802 --> 01:43:04,600
but you're probably not
ready to believe...

1123
01:43:04,637 --> 01:43:08,187
Giselle can do
anything she wants to.

1124
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:09,767
Giselle?

1125
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,353
We're strong women, she and I.

1126
01:43:12,937 --> 01:43:14,610
Shall we make it a foursome?

1127
01:43:17,066 --> 01:43:18,864
Let's go.

1128
01:43:24,323 --> 01:43:26,166
Take us to ze most romantic

1129
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:27,789
spot in Monte Carlo.

1130
01:43:54,603 --> 01:43:55,946
Well...

1131
01:44:00,609 --> 01:44:03,408
Yeah, being chief
mechanic is important,

1132
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:07,367
but I didn't exactly win
the race all by myself.

1133
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:09,994
No?

1134
01:44:10,995 --> 01:44:13,168
Well, almost.

1135
01:44:14,305 --> 01:45:14,314
