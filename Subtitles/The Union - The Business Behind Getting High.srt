00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,004
Marijuana History 101.

2
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:11,374
Or should I say extremely brief
Marijuana History 101?

3
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:13,242
It's big, complicated,

4
00:00:13,244 --> 00:00:15,611
and we'll only be able to
scratch the surface,

5
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:17,646
so let's get started.

6
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:19,514
The first thing
that strikes one as odd

7
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:21,415
when looking at the history
of marijuana,

8
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,517
which is also known as cannabis,

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,186
is how very much legal
it once was.

10
00:00:26,188 --> 00:00:28,154
In fact, it wasn't only legal,

11
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:30,689
it just happened to be one of
the largest agricultural crops

12
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:34,025
in the world,
including the United States.

13
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:37,461
You see, cannabis can also be
hemp-- and just what is hemp?

14
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:40,597
Well, it's by and large
the most robust, durable,

15
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:43,366
natural soft fiber on the face
of this planet.

16
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:45,368
Up until 1883,

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,336
and for
thousands of years before,

18
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,472
cannabis hemp was the largest
agricultural crop in the world.

19
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:53,107
It had thousands of uses
and products.

20
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:55,375
The majority of
fabric, lighting oil,

21
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:58,644
medicines, paper and fiber
came from hemp.

22
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:01,647
The first marijuana law
to exist in the United States

23
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,316
was a law ordering farmers
to grow hemp.

24
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:06,451
Benjamin Franklin
used it to start

25
00:01:06,453 --> 00:01:08,486
one of America's
first paper mills.

26
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:10,821
The first two copies of
the Declaration of Independence

27
00:01:10,823 --> 00:01:13,456
were written on cannabis
hemp paper.

28
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,058
Up until the 1800s,
most of the textiles

29
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,226
in the United States were
made with hemp.

30
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:21,495
50% of medicine marketed in the
last half of the 19th century

31
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:23,330
was made from cannabis.

32
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:26,433
Even Queen Victoria used
the resin extracts from cannabis

33
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:28,501
to alleviate her
menstrual cramps.

34
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:30,503
But the funny thing about
industrial hemp

35
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:32,371
was you couldn't
get high from it,

36
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:34,373
yet it was lumped in
with the following,

37
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:37,376
which also made little sense--
"Reefer Madness."

38
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:40,512
In the early 20th century,
yellow journalism had surfaced.

39
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:43,848
Articles depicted blacks and
Mexicans as frenzied beasts

40
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,550
who would smoke marijuana,
play devil's music,

41
00:01:46,552 --> 00:01:49,653
and heap disrespect and
viciousness on the readership,

42
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:52,088
a majority of which happened
to be white.

43
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,757
Some offenses included
looking at a white woman twice,

44
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,625
laughing at a white person,

45
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:59,594
or even stepping on
white men's shadows,

46
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:02,630
and this ended up leading to a
law in the form of a tax stamp,

47
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:05,499
a tax stamp that would not only
include marijuana,

48
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,335
but also hemp
and cannabis medicines.

49
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,470
It speculated that hemp's
potential

50
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:12,305
for an abundance of new products

51
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:15,107
was going to be in direct
competition with other sources.

52
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:17,642
And this,
added to the Reefer Madness,

53
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:20,778
led to the eventual downfall of
all forms of cannabis.

54
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,281
"Popular Mechanics" magazine had
actually prepared an article

55
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:26,850
entitled
"New Billion-Dollar Crop."

56
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:28,785
Hemp was touted as being
able to produce

57
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:32,188
more than 5,000 textile products
from its threadlike fiber

58
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,124
and more than 25,000
products from its cellulose,

59
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:37,392
ranging from dynamite
to cellophane.

60
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:40,895
Its superiority as a source for
paper was also becoming known,

61
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:44,531
especially with the development
of hemp-processing equipment.

62
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,600
Now, the new Marijuana Tax Act
was all fine and dandy,

63
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:49,234
except for one thing.

64
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,836
If you wanted to grow hemp,
you needed to buy a stamp,

65
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,704
but they weren't giving
any out--

66
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,572
To anybody.

67
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:59,275
And so, in effect, all forms of
cannabis became illegal.

68
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:02,645
Things pretty much stayed
that way until World War II,

69
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:04,546
when the government decided
that hemp,

70
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:06,281
once again, was a good thing,

71
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:08,583
and produced a video,
"Hemp for Victory."

72
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:11,519
But by the time the war was
over, hemp again became bad,

73
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:13,420
and in 1948,

74
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:16,222
when the Marijuana Law
once again came into question,

75
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:18,490
Congress recognized that
marijuana was made illegal

76
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:20,225
for the wrong reason.

77
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:21,859
It didn't make people
violent at all.

78
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:23,760
It made them pacifists.

79
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:27,663
The Communists would use it to
weaken America's will to fight.

80
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,665
Congress now voted to keep
marijuana illegal

81
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,600
for the exact opposite reason

82
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,768
they had outlawed it
in the first place.

83
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,603
And all through the years,

84
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:38,205
report after report,
commissioned by everybody,

85
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:39,839
from the mayor of New York

86
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:41,707
to the president
of the United States,

87
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,775
has come back with the view
that marijuana

88
00:03:43,777 --> 00:03:46,177
should have no criminal
penalty attached to it.

89
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:49,380
Yet marijuana remains
as illegal today

90
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:51,515
as it did nearly 70 years ago.

92
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,811
Marijuana.

93
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,779
It's become big business,

94
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:00,547
a multibillion-dollar business

95
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:02,782
both in Canada
and the United States,

96
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:05,785
but why has it become
such a big business?

97
00:05:05,787 --> 00:05:07,620
Here in British Columbia alone,

98
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:10,022
it's speculated that
the illegal BC marijuana trade

99
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:13,358
brings in upwards of
$7 billion annually,

100
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,526
and up to 85% of that product

101
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,761
heads south
to the United States.

102
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:21,765
Having become an international
issue, when do the lines blur?

103
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:24,567
How does a massive underground
market like this survive

104
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:26,602
while remaining illegal?

105
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:30,038
Why is marijuana illegal
in the first place?

106
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,274
And if Prohibition
is meant to protect us,

107
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:35,676
I guess the most obvious
question is,

108
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:38,445
does the Prohibition work?

109
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:45,718
If Prohibition worked, okay?

110
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,920
If you could just wave
a magic wand and say,

111
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:51,757
"This is gone away,"
I'd be all over it, you know?

112
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,692
But the fact of the matter is

113
00:05:53,694 --> 00:05:55,527
that Prohibition
has never worked.

114
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,395
You know,
we've been here before.

115
00:05:57,397 --> 00:05:59,663
You remember the first
Prohibition, right?

116
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:01,531
Which was?

117
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:03,299
Prohibition of alcohol.

118
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:05,534
No, no, I'm talking about
the<i> first</i> Prohibition.

119
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:07,636
"Thou shalt not partake

120
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:10,438
of the fruit of the tree
of knowledge."

121
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,041
And who was the big cop?

122
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:17,911
And how many people
did He have to watch?

123
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:19,712
Two.

124
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,947
What are the goals
of this Prohibition?

125
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,349
I assume the goals
of Prohibition

126
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,385
are to reduce the amount
of drugs available

127
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,987
and to reduce
the demand for those drugs.

128
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:34,391
In both instances, cannabis
Prohibition's an utter failure.

129
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,059
Has the Prohibition stopped
people from using marijuana?

130
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:37,727
You get a phone call,
and it says,

131
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:39,361
"I'm from
the federal government.

132
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:40,929
"I wanna know whether
you've been using cocaine

133
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:42,363
or marijuana recently."

134
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:43,897
Presumably, you might be
getting a little bit

135
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:46,466
of an underestimate.

136
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:49,034
In 1937, there were estimated
to be 55,000 marijuana users,

137
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:50,936
and now there are estimated

138
00:06:50,938 --> 00:06:52,904
to be more than 50 million
of them.

139
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:56,107
That's a 100,000% increase.

140
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:58,042
Seems to be quite a few of them.

141
00:06:58,044 --> 00:06:59,843
Yes, I'm afraid there are.

142
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:02,979
Whether the drug is
criminalized or decriminalized

143
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:06,816
does not affect the rates of
smoking of cannabis,

144
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:09,118
either of uptake
or of discontinuation.

145
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,720
So what are the dangers
of using marijuana?

146
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,788
I don't know.

147
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,389
I don't know.

148
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:17,591
It gives you, like,
a rapid heartbeat.

149
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:19,392
Smoker's cough.

150
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:22,928
I'm sure it has some effect on
your brain function, memory.

151
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,963
I don't know,
is there something unhealthy

152
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:26,831
about moving slowly?

153
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,499
It's just not good for you.

154
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,501
You're not fully conscientious
of what you're doing.

155
00:07:30,503 --> 00:07:32,836
Thickens some membranes
in your brain or something.

156
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:34,571
Well, it's been science--
I guess it's--

157
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:37,006
I'm being told it's been
scientifically proven

158
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:39,475
that marijuana
kills your brain cells.

159
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:43,912
Ahh, that's one I remember--
Marijuana kills brain cells.

160
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:45,613
I thought the same thing.

161
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:47,648
You know, I didn't start smoking
pot until about five years ago.

162
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,383
I thought pot made you stupid.

163
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,151
I bought into it just as
much as anybody did.

164
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:53,686
I realized when I was like
30 years old that I was tricked.

165
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:55,788
I was like, "You got to be
fucking kidding me."

166
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,423
1974, the Heath-Tulane study.

167
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:02,427
Ronald Reagan announces the most
reliable scientific sources say

168
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:04,829
permanent brain damage is one of
the inevitable results

169
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:06,664
of the use of marijuana.

170
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,499
Monkeys pumped
full of marijuana,

171
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,167
apparently 30 joints a day,

172
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:12,769
had begun to atrophy and die
after 90 days.

173
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:14,470
Brain damage was determined
after counting

174
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:16,171
the dead brain cells
of both monkeys

175
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:18,173
who had been
subjected to the marijuana

176
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,841
and ones who had not.

177
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:21,909
The study became the foundation
of the government

178
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:23,911
and other
special-interest groups' claim

179
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:26,046
that marijuana
kills brain cells.

180
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,048
Here's what they didn't
tell you.

181
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,783
After six years of requests,

182
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:32,185
how the study was conducted
was finally revealed.

183
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:34,754
Instead of administering
30 joints a day for one year,

184
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,922
Dr. Heath used
a method of pumping

185
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:38,990
63 Columbian-strength joints

186
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:42,526
through a gas mask within
five minutes over three months.

187
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:44,494
They suffocated the monkeys.

188
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:46,529
What they did is they
put these gas masks,

189
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:48,464
basically on their face,
and they pumped pot into it,

190
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:50,732
but without additional oxygen,

191
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:53,568
so after "X" amount of time,
the brain shut down.

192
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,902
Well, if you suffocate,

193
00:08:54,904 --> 00:08:56,570
the first thing
that's gonna happen

194
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:58,538
is your brain cells are gonna
die with lack of oxygen.

195
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,473
So what they did is they
suffocated the monkey,

196
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:02,041
showed all these
dead brain cells,

197
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:04,443
and then went on to associate it

198
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:07,045
by saying that cannabis use
causes your brain cells to die.

199
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,715
And how many people, not knowing
the origin of the study,

200
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,084
have gone on to
quote it and re-quote it,

201
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,152
and now people believe it.

202
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:18,622
Studies since have shown no
signs of any brain-cell damage.

203
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,124
In 2005, new research suggested

204
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:24,026
that marijuana could possibly
<i>stimulate</i> brain-cell growth.

205
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:27,729
That study hasn't received
the same attention.

206
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:31,133
Another common belief--
Marijuana causes lung cancer.

207
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,702
In the 1999 study by the
Institute of Medicine

208
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:36,204
that was paid for by
the United States Government,

209
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:40,841
they had to use words like "may"
and "should" cause cancer.

210
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:43,176
We've been hearing
for years them trying to say

211
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:45,611
that it causes lung cancer,
and we say, "Really?

212
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:47,879
"That's interesting, because
you can't even show us one case

213
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:51,015
of cancer being caused by
cannabis use alone."

214
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:53,083
You definitely
have to do it moderately

215
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:54,918
because it does paralyze
the cilia,

216
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,753
but if it's not radioactive,

217
00:09:56,755 --> 00:09:58,988
you're probably not going
to get cancer from it.

218
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,889
Smoking it can be harmful

219
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,625
because of the properties
of smoke.

220
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:05,793
Not as a result of anything
in the cannabis plant,

221
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:07,761
but because they're
intaking heated plant matter

222
00:10:07,763 --> 00:10:09,062
into their lungs.

223
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:10,897
People said,
"Well, you don't know.

224
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:12,632
We haven't been smoking it
long enough."

225
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,600
Look what happened
with cigarettes.

226
00:10:14,602 --> 00:10:16,134
We've had about four decades,

227
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:18,269
more than four decades,
of experience.

228
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:21,205
If this was gonna show up,
it should have shown up by now.

229
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:23,874
Finally, a study came out just
in the last month verifying

230
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:26,176
that cannabis smoke
does not cause cancer.

231
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:28,144
It's different than nicotine,

232
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:31,280
and the elements in the tobacco
smoke do cause cancer,

233
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:34,883
and elements
in the marijuana don't.

234
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,951
There's no cases of
marijuana-only smokers

235
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:39,019
getting brown-lung syndrome.

236
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:40,787
There's no cases of
marijuana-only smokers

237
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:42,355
getting emphysema.

238
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:44,757
Strange for a plant
that's so "dangerous."

239
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,358
How come none of that?

240
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,828
Marijuana is as bad for you
or worse than tobacco?

241
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,996
Impossible.

242
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:53,731
If they had the evidence,

243
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:57,401
they'd be putting emaciated
bodies or emphysema,

244
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:59,770
lung cancer, black lungs,

245
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:01,905
they would be parading them
throughout the media.

246
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:04,040
They don't have one,
yet people, somehow or other,

247
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:06,008
think that it might cause
the same thing.

248
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,877
In fact, if you look at the
straight deaths from substances,

249
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,112
a different type of picture
starts to appear.

250
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:13,147
The number-one killer
in the country--

251
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:16,917
It beat out AIDS,
heroin, crack, cocaine,

252
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,054
alcohol, car accidents, fire
and murder combined.

253
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,955
Tobacco.

254
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:26,224
That's a nasty,
dirty thing to say, sir.

255
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:31,027
A lovely, pure, white cigarette,
causing cancer.

256
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:33,696
It gets me right here.

257
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:39,334
With an average of 430,000
deaths per year,

258
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:41,969
considering it's
the number-one killer,

259
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:43,737
it's interesting to know that

260
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:46,306
tobacco receives
government subsidies--

261
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:48,675
And is grown with radioactive
fertilizer.

262
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:55,948
Now get out there
and sell cigarettes!

263
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,816
Number two on the list?

264
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,218
If we don't include poor diet
and physical inactivity,

265
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,155
with well over 85,000
deaths a year... alcohol.

266
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,390
As we look much further
down the list,

267
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:09,692
there are others
that may surprise you.

268
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:12,895
Caffeine comes in with one
to 10,000 deaths a year.

269
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:15,764
And some of our most
popular pain relievers--

270
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:19,000
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs such as aspirin--

271
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:22,737
Still make an appearance with
over 7,500 deaths annually.

272
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:25,072
Where does marijuana lie
in this?

273
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:27,741
What kind of staggering
number do we find?

274
00:12:27,743 --> 00:12:30,210
I don't know, 50,000?

275
00:12:30,212 --> 00:12:31,878
250,000?

276
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,379
300,000?

277
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:34,947
From marijuana?

278
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:36,915
I would probably say,
then, 80,000.

279
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:39,117
I would say it would
be hundreds of billions.

280
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:41,919
Get ready for it--
Here it comes.

281
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:47,023
There are no deaths from
cannabis use anywhere.

282
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:49,191
You can't find one.

283
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:52,127
In 10,000 years of
known use of marijuana,

284
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:54,896
there's never been a single
death attributed to marijuana.

285
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:58,165
There's 400,000 deaths
in America alone

286
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:01,401
every year that are directly
attributed to tobacco.

287
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:03,870
I've heard that you have
to smoke something like

288
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:06,405
15,000 joints in 20 minutes

289
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:09,508
to get a toxic amount of
delta 9-tetrahydracannabinol.

290
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,776
I challenge anybody to do that.

291
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:13,811
And even in the animal studies

292
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:15,746
where people have loaded
the animals up

293
00:13:15,748 --> 00:13:17,380
with doses that would
be hundreds of times

294
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:19,782
what a human could possibly
be exposed to,

295
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:21,984
no, animals don't die.

296
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:24,319
The LD50 seems to be
astronomical.

297
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:27,121
You can die from ingesting
too much aspirin.

298
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:29,456
You can die from
ingesting too much coffee.

299
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,393
The drug warriors who say,
"We have to protect society,

300
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,762
save these people,"

301
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:38,798
are being just a little bit
disingenuous.

302
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,200
Not one university
or medical facility

303
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:43,035
has ever recorded a single death

304
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:45,103
directly attributed
to marijuana.

305
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:47,238
But never mind that.

306
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,808
There's other problems,
other reasons to fear it.

307
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,110
Take addiction, for example.

308
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:55,278
There are more kids in
addiction clinics for marijuana

309
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,046
than any other substance.

310
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:58,881
This must mean that marijuana

311
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:01,216
is the most addictive
substance today.

312
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:04,018
It's undoubtedly true
that there are more teenagers

313
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,021
and kids in treatment
for marijuana

314
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:09,289
than all the
other drugs combined.

315
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,091
What the DEA never tells you
is<i> why</i> that's true.

316
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:15,427
A kid is caught
possessing or smoking marijuana.

317
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,997
He's taken to court,
he's given a choice.

318
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:22,233
Either you, you know,
some horrible penalty,

319
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:25,069
or you go to a treatment center.

320
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:27,871
Obviously chooses to go
to treatment,

321
00:14:27,873 --> 00:14:30,540
and goes to treatment there,
he's considered an addict.

322
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,975
But then the DEA gets the point
of that stat and says,

323
00:14:32,977 --> 00:14:35,010
"Look at all these kids
in treatment for marijuana.

324
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:37,278
"God, it must be because
today's marijuana

325
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,546
is not the marijuana that
your parents were smoking."

326
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:42,482
As far as I understand,
only 3% of the people

327
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:45,485
in treatment for marijuana
are there voluntarily.

328
00:14:45,487 --> 00:14:49,155
The other 97% were
told to by their guardian

329
00:14:49,157 --> 00:14:51,157
or told to by a judge,

330
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,992
"You can choose between jail
or treatment."

331
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:55,094
A lot of people
choose treatment.

332
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:59,298
It provides no basis for
speaking about addiction.

333
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,169
Anybody who is at all
sophisticated about marijuana

334
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:07,605
would rate them the way
two researchers

335
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:11,575
were asked to rate drugs
in order of addiction.

336
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,844
Nicotine was one,
alcohol was two.

337
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:18,547
Then heroin, then cocaine,
then coffee,

338
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:20,549
and then marijuana.

339
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:22,417
There may have been a couple
of other drugs,

340
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:24,285
but marijuana
was at the very bottom.

341
00:15:24,287 --> 00:15:26,253
Below coffee.

342
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:29,022
<i>This narcotic, unlike
the opiates, the synthetics,</i>

343
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:31,391
<i>and cocaine, is nonaddictive.</i>

344
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:33,893
<i>What do you mean by
"nonaddictive"?</i>

345
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:36,462
<i>By "nonaddictive," it is meant
that the user of marijuana,</i>

346
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,297
<i>when deprived of the drug,</i>

347
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:40,966
<i>will not experience
the agonies of withdrawal.</i>

348
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:44,602
<i>It is habituating, but its
use can be discontinued.</i>

349
00:15:44,604 --> 00:15:46,637
<i>Then what is its danger?</i>

350
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,006
It's used as a scapegoat

351
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:53,442
for covering up underlying
problems in people,

352
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:55,277
especially young people.

353
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,246
"Here I am, don't ignore me."

354
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:02,450
If you use marijuana on
a daily basis for a year or so,

355
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:04,418
and you stop using it,

356
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,253
you're gonna
notice some differences,

357
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:08,355
but nothing like the kind of
withdrawal people will

358
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:10,557
experience withdrawing from
either tobacco or heroin.

359
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,992
But why would the government
and the DEA

360
00:16:12,994 --> 00:16:15,160
wanna put a statistic
like that out there?

361
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:18,363
We'll learn more
about that later.

362
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:20,331
The Gateway Theory.

363
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,399
Is marijuana a gateway drug?

364
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,467
Yes, I think it is.

365
00:16:24,469 --> 00:16:26,402
If you haven't--
How do you know?

366
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:29,138
I don't exactly know why,
but I know it is.

367
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,406
It opens the doorway
to other drugs.

368
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,608
It makes you wanna
experience more.

369
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,276
It makes you feel good. Yeah.

370
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:37,211
People wanna experience
something else,

371
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:39,580
and you know, have a...

372
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,015
I guess, more dreams.

373
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:44,283
<i>Its greatest danger
lies in the fact</i>

374
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:46,418
<i>that it is a steppingstone
to the harder drugs,</i>

375
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,253
<i>such as morphine and heroin.</i>

376
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:50,021
That's why there are people

377
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:51,989
that wanna legalize marijuana.

378
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:54,291
They think if they can get the
young people of this country

379
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:57,360
onto hard drugs, they can
destroy<i> your</i> generation

380
00:16:57,362 --> 00:16:59,662
during this generation.

381
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:02,331
You know, in the days
of Harry Anslinger,

382
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,534
it was called the
Steppingstone Hypothesis.

383
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:08,603
If you stepped on this stone,
marijuana,

384
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:11,939
you were bound and determined
to go onto the next stone,

385
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:14,675
which would be one of
the so-called hard drugs.

386
00:17:14,677 --> 00:17:19,046
Every time it's been studied
and looked at and so on,

387
00:17:19,048 --> 00:17:22,549
they have never,
ever found that there's--

388
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:24,684
Certainly nothing<i> in</i> marijuana
that makes you

389
00:17:24,686 --> 00:17:27,019
want to go to anything else.

390
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:30,288
There is no inherent
psycho-pharmacological property

391
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,691
of the drug which pushes one
toward another drug.

392
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:35,459
I'll smoke a joint,

393
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:38,028
I want a bag of chips
and fucking junk food.

394
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,397
I don't wanna go out
and get ripped.

395
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:43,266
I drink alcohol,
that's my drug of choice.

396
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:45,468
It could be said
I started on milk.

397
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,203
I mean, this is crazy.

398
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:49,738
If I use marijuana,
why does that automatically

399
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,341
make me a candidate
to black-tar heroin?

400
00:17:53,343 --> 00:17:56,143
It's a nonsensical argument.

401
00:17:56,145 --> 00:18:00,547
In fact, only one out of every
104 marijuana users use cocaine,

402
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:02,582
and less than one use heroin.

403
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:05,284
The black market throws
the dealers of soft drugs

404
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:07,386
together with the dealer
of hard drugs.

405
00:18:07,388 --> 00:18:09,421
So if you have a black market,

406
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,323
and you have a dealer that's
dealing in marijuana and LSD

407
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,757
and everything else,

408
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,492
and the dealer might say to you,

409
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,293
"Hey, you wanna try
something stronger?"

410
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:20,162
Well, in that sense,<i> because</i>
of the black market,

411
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:22,097
because of Prohibition,

412
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:25,567
people may be more susceptible
to seeing these other drugs

413
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:28,102
and being willing
to try these other drugs.

414
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:30,405
And so what you see is that
there is a gateway effect,

415
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:33,241
but it's a gateway effect
caused by Prohibition

416
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,876
and the blending of the
hard- and soft-drug markets.

417
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:37,777
Where does this leave us?

418
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:40,780
Oh, wait-- what about laziness?

419
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:44,116
You will be useless to
society if you use marijuana.

420
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:47,486
But if that's true, well, there
are about 50 million people

421
00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:49,521
who smoke marijuana in America,

422
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:52,190
and over half of the Canadian
population who've tried it.

423
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:56,294
And yet, both societies
seem to flourish.

424
00:18:56,296 --> 00:18:58,329
And just look who
some of these people are.

425
00:18:58,331 --> 00:19:00,431
Steven Jobs developed
Apple Computer smoking pot.

426
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:03,233
Ted Turner developed
CNN News smoking pot,

427
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:04,867
still smokes a joint every day.

428
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:06,802
You go through every musician
you like,

429
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:08,703
from the Rolling Stones to
the Beatles to Led Zeppelin.

430
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,337
They all smoked pot.

431
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:11,838
Snoop Dogg, Willie Nelson.

432
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,606
Come on, Bill Clinton,
for fuck--

433
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:16,275
He didn't inhale, man.

434
00:19:16,277 --> 00:19:18,810
Don't be so naive!

435
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:21,646
Virtually every
presidential candidate

436
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:24,782
has now copped to using
marijuana at some time

437
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:26,784
in his or her life.

438
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:30,521
A few times in the Army,
I tried marijuana.

439
00:19:30,523 --> 00:19:34,558
It was not
a significant part of my life.

440
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,260
I had a senior law-enforcement
official tell me,

441
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:38,894
that in his judgment,

442
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:40,829
up to a quarter
of the White House staff,

443
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,530
when they first came in,

444
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:44,398
had used drugs in the last
four or five years.

445
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,466
The people that have
personality problems

446
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:48,601
and the people that are
gonna be lazy

447
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:49,902
and gonna lose their job,

448
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:51,737
they're gonna lose
their job, anyway.

449
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:54,206
They're not losing their
job because of marijuana.

450
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,707
That's just a lie!

451
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:57,508
I love Tommy Chong.

452
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,243
I think that a lot of the
"Cheech and Chong" episodes,

453
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:00,777
that people believed,

454
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,712
not knowing that Tommy
wrote and directed the movies,

455
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:05,247
thinking that, you know, that's
what a stupid stoner looks like.

456
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:07,916
No, actually, that's what a
really brilliant creative genius

457
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:10,952
looks like<i> acting</i> like somebody
you think's a stoner.

458
00:20:10,954 --> 00:20:13,587
And none of this is
borne out in the research

459
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:16,923
or when you look at people
who are long-term users.

460
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,926
And there happen to be
lawyers, judges, doctors,

461
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,727
and, you know, writers.

462
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:24,796
But what about the potency
of the drug?

463
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:26,798
"Marijuana is dangerous.

464
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,201
There's higher THC levels
than ever before."

465
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:33,671
Any time you got a bag of
Columbian dope 20 years ago,

466
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:35,706
it was way better than
the Mexican shwag

467
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,507
that you normally got,

468
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:39,976
so there's always been a range
of THC in plants.

469
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:42,511
And the fact that
we can now grow stuff

470
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:45,247
that's equivalent of what
Columbian was, 20 years,

471
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:47,482
well, it doesn't mean
that we're boosting THC

472
00:20:47,484 --> 00:20:48,916
to unheard-of levels.

473
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:51,518
It just means, you know,
"Hi, there are some nuances

474
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,254
in this discussion that people
should be aware of."

475
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:56,889
And I actually think that it's
a real stroke of our own ego

476
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:59,791
to think that for the 50
or so years of Prohibition

477
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:02,426
that we've improved
upon varieties

478
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,428
that have been
cultivated for drug use

479
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,364
in places like India and such,
for thousands of years.

480
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,532
People say, "Well,
you can abuse marijuana."

481
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,934
Well, shit, you can abuse
cheeseburgers, too, you know?

482
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:13,936
You don't go around closing
Burger King

483
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:15,671
because you can abuse something.

484
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:17,639
I can take a fucking fork
and jam it in my eyeballs.

485
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:19,374
Does that mean forks should
be illegal?

486
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:20,908
You know,
I could jump off a bridge.

487
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,510
Should we outlaw bridges--
Let's Nerf the world.

488
00:21:23,512 --> 00:21:25,745
But what about all the crime
and violence associated

489
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,613
with marijuana?

490
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:30,515
From beat cop to police chief,

491
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:34,719
I saw ample evidence of
the harm caused by alcohol

492
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:38,556
and the absence of evidence
caused by marijuana use.

493
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,958
And I mean the complete absence.

494
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,927
I cannot recall a single case

495
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:48,364
in which marijuana contributed
to domestic violence,

496
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:51,300
crimes of theft and the like.

497
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:53,669
You wanna know what
a weed smoker looks like?

498
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:55,270
You're staring at one.

499
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,771
You know, like,
I'm a weed smoker.

500
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,672
I'm not, like, crazy or,
you know,

501
00:21:58,674 --> 00:22:00,006
I'm not stabbing you right now.

502
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:02,041
Most of the violent crime
that's committed,

503
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:03,776
or most of crime,
period, that's committed

504
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:05,778
or having to do with drugs
is people who are on drugs

505
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,312
committing violent crimes.

506
00:22:07,314 --> 00:22:09,514
If you make it legal,
if you make it cheaper,

507
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:10,781
you make it more available,

508
00:22:10,783 --> 00:22:12,449
you're gonna have more
violence, more--

509
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:14,484
Tom, that is not true,
stop lying to us.

510
00:22:14,486 --> 00:22:16,319
Oh, now come on.
Stop lying to us.

511
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:17,620
That is not true.

512
00:22:17,622 --> 00:22:19,488
You know--
Don't tell me that.

513
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,289
I've smoked pot, Tom.

514
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,890
I've admitted it, I've done it.

515
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:24,625
I've done all of the big three.

516
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:26,693
I've done tobacco,
I've done alcohol,

517
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:28,928
and I've done marijuana,
Tom-- guess what?

518
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,697
Marijuana's the least
of the three, pal.

519
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:33,598
You guys prove me wrong,
or whatever,

520
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,766
I want to hear someone
that has smoked too much weed

521
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:37,968
and went home and beat his wife

522
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,337
and beat his
children, or whatever,

523
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,155
like you see on booze.

524
00:22:42,156 --> 00:22:43,972
The only big issue around
alcohol is drunken driving

525
00:22:43,975 --> 00:22:46,008
and binge drinking among
college students.

526
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,477
Otherwise, you can drink
to your heart's content.

527
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:50,612
There are far more
crimes committed

528
00:22:50,614 --> 00:22:52,847
under the influence of
unadulterated,

529
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,748
if you will, emotions.

530
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,816
Anger, rage, jealousy.

531
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:59,485
A lot of our understanding is
driven by what's in the paper

532
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:01,553
and on the television
and the radio these days.

533
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:03,388
And we get extremes,

534
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,056
and the black-and-white
thinking is reinforced,

535
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:06,657
I think, by that.

536
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,925
If only there is something
to compare it to,

537
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:12,061
something that was prohibited at
one time but is now regulated,

538
00:23:12,063 --> 00:23:14,530
so we could see what
the difference might be.

539
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:20,068
Hmm, what could that be...
what could that be?

540
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,805
Under Prohibition of alcohol,
<i>everything</i> got worse.

541
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:25,673
Everything.

542
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:28,575
Alcohol Prohibition really
birthed and gave rise

543
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:30,944
to massive organized
criminal groups

544
00:23:30,946 --> 00:23:32,912
within the United States...

545
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:35,781
It led to a general
disregard for the law

546
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:38,750
and a general disregard
for police activity

547
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:42,587
because it was a law
that most people didn't obey.

548
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,956
Would you have supported
the Prohibition of alcohol

549
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,624
75 years ago?

550
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,626
Well, I'm glad you brought up
the alcohol example.

551
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,694
I mean, as a governor,
you must have known firsthand

552
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,562
the cost of alcohol.

553
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,430
I hear this argument a lot
of times, like alcohol--

554
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,964
That isn't what
I asked you, Tom.

555
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:58,533
I asked you a specific question,
don't give me spin.

556
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:02,069
I said, would you have supported
the Prohibition of alcohol

557
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:04,471
75 years ago?

558
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:06,372
I don't think I would have. Why?

559
00:24:06,374 --> 00:24:08,040
Because alcohol,
for better or worse,

560
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,841
and a lot of times for worse--
It's a close call--

561
00:24:09,843 --> 00:24:12,443
Is long-entrenched and ingrained

562
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:14,511
part of our
culture and our society.

563
00:24:14,513 --> 00:24:16,479
I mean, you go back
thousands of years,

564
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:18,514
the first writing is about
alcohol, the Bible,

565
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:19,848
everything else.

566
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,983
Really-- well, Tom,
wait a minute.

567
00:24:21,985 --> 00:24:25,019
Let me inject something then--
If you believe that God--

568
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:27,421
God also made
the marijuana plant.

569
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:28,755
I'm talking about society.

570
00:24:28,757 --> 00:24:30,690
I'm talking about our culture
and our society.

571
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:32,625
Wait, you just said "the Bible."

572
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:36,929
Alcohol poisoning went up
by 600% during Prohibition.

573
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:40,666
There were more speakeasies in
large cities like New York City,

574
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:42,534
under Prohibition,

575
00:24:42,536 --> 00:24:45,737
than there are taverns
and liquor stores today.

576
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:48,106
Sure, one can point to alcohol

577
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:50,942
as being a continuing
social problem,

578
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,978
but we don't have
people shooting each other

579
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,679
over alcohol.

580
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:57,647
When alcohol was prohibited,

581
00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:00,516
people lived at that time
to know the difference between.

582
00:25:00,518 --> 00:25:03,118
Prohibition and non-Prohibition.

583
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,753
They could see that the
Prohibition of alcohol

584
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:08,989
caused the emergence of
gangsters and the underworld

585
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:11,057
that took control of these
substances.

586
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:13,893
Alcohol then was
no longer in their control.

587
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:16,195
Could this be the same
for marijuana?

588
00:25:16,197 --> 00:25:18,497
It strengthens organized crime,
without a doubt,

589
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:20,499
because you have to
be a criminal to sell it.

590
00:25:20,501 --> 00:25:22,100
It's that simple.

591
00:25:22,102 --> 00:25:24,068
This brings crime into it.

592
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,204
That's why-- the benefits
and the ability to make money

593
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:29,072
is so huge in it.

594
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:31,207
Weapons were used
to intimidate people,

595
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:33,943
and we seized approximately
50 weapons,

596
00:25:33,945 --> 00:25:38,614
sawed-off shotguns,
and most of them are loaded.

597
00:25:38,616 --> 00:25:42,985
Where's all this competition
we've heard so much about?

598
00:25:42,987 --> 00:25:45,887
You call these prices low?

599
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:47,989
Marijuana is just a weed.

600
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:50,825
And marijuana is worth more,
ounce for ounce, than gold.

601
00:25:50,827 --> 00:25:53,661
You don't find legal
commodities, you know,

602
00:25:53,663 --> 00:25:55,929
at $200 an ounce.

603
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:57,897
You don't even find them
at $200 a pound.

604
00:25:57,899 --> 00:25:59,865
Heck, most things
are $200 a<i> ton,</i>

605
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:01,833
for corn and grain and barley.

606
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:03,868
That's why when you walk
ten pounds of marijuana

607
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,103
across the border into
the United States,

608
00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:08,105
it becomes worth 20 pounds.

609
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:11,675
You create an artificially
inflated value for that drug

610
00:26:11,677 --> 00:26:14,944
that is so huge that
people decide

611
00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:18,514
it's worth murdering people

612
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:21,149
in order to control this market.

613
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:23,618
I think the Fraser Institute
called cannabis Prohibition

614
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,053
"a gift of revenue to
organized crime."

615
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:28,522
But what do growers and dealers
think of this?

616
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:30,190
Would you like to see
the government in the future

617
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:31,624
legalize marijuana here in BC?

618
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:33,125
No, it's stealing money from us.

619
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:35,694
I know I wouldn't like
to see it legalized.

620
00:26:35,696 --> 00:26:38,630
The government would control
and regulate the product,

621
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:41,666
and that could potentially hurt
a lot of people in the industry.

622
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:43,267
How can you compete
with factories

623
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,802
of perfectly rolled-out doobies?

624
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,004
They'd perfect it, and we'd
all be out of money.

625
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,772
It makes for strange bedfellows.

626
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,641
You've got the police and the
high-level drug dealers

627
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:55,910
both agreeing that we should
maintain this Prohibition.

628
00:26:55,912 --> 00:26:58,013
Well, when you got
high-level drug dealers

629
00:26:58,015 --> 00:26:59,748
saying Prohibition is good,

630
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,716
you might wanna scratch your
head a little and think,

631
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:04,652
"Well, shoot, why would they
want to continue Prohibition?"

632
00:27:04,654 --> 00:27:07,855
I can't imagine why a grower
who's making $150,000

633
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:09,857
or $300,000 a year

634
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:11,692
would ever wanna see
marijuana legalized.

635
00:27:11,694 --> 00:27:15,395
I mean, the last thing a grower
wants is sensible policy.

636
00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:18,631
The madness continues,
and they continue to get rich.

637
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:20,165
You know, Betty,

638
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,767
I'm going to bring this up at
the business meeting tomorrow.

639
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:24,301
You make the penalties stiffer?

640
00:27:24,303 --> 00:27:26,053
You know what-- good.

641
00:27:26,054 --> 00:27:27,804
For those people who are not
getting caught, price goes up.

642
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:30,706
See, so not only do
we allow them to tell us

643
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,808
how much drugs are gonna
be supplied,

644
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,377
or the potency of those drugs,
who they're gonna sell it to,

645
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:37,011
where they're gonna sell them,

646
00:27:37,013 --> 00:27:38,979
just to make sure
they get it all right,

647
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:40,981
we let them keep all
of the profits.

648
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:43,383
So you've got
essentially a Wild West.

649
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:48,020
You've got an unregulated market
in which anything can happen.

650
00:27:48,022 --> 00:27:51,890
It certainly may work for things
that people generally accept,

651
00:27:51,892 --> 00:27:55,894
but if you try to prohibit
something that's in demand

652
00:27:55,896 --> 00:28:00,164
that the people want,
then it's pure folly.

653
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,032
And without control,

654
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:05,001
it's hard to regulate
areas of concern,

655
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:07,903
like keeping it out of
the hands of our children.

656
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:10,405
There have been some studies
that suggest

657
00:28:10,407 --> 00:28:13,841
heavy, sustained long-term use
from adolescence to adulthood

658
00:28:13,843 --> 00:28:16,310
has the potential
to exasperate symptoms

659
00:28:16,312 --> 00:28:18,345
of those with a genetic
predisposition

660
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:20,680
for schizophrenia.

661
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:23,416
And although there is strong
evidence that refutes this,

662
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:26,118
it does lead one to question:

663
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,754
Could there be a better way of
deterring children from using,

664
00:28:29,756 --> 00:28:33,124
rather than letting dealers
decide what age is appropriate?

665
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:35,092
For the last ten years,

666
00:28:35,094 --> 00:28:38,028
our children across
the United States have said

667
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,164
that it's easier to buy
illegal drugs

668
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,766
than it is to buy
beer and cigarettes.

669
00:28:43,768 --> 00:28:45,434
It's harder to get beer

670
00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:47,702
because you have to go through
a regulated establishment

671
00:28:47,704 --> 00:28:49,203
that's going to check ID,

672
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:51,038
that's gonna have
those safeguards in place,

673
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,906
that isn't just gonna
sell it to you

674
00:28:52,908 --> 00:28:54,407
'cause you got
40 bucks in your pocket.

675
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:56,208
Guy down on the street corner,

676
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,909
he doesn't want to know
how old they are.

677
00:28:57,911 --> 00:29:00,077
He doesn't wanna see an ID,
he says, "Show me the money."

678
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,978
And if they get the money,

679
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,347
it doesn't matter if that child
is four years old.

680
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:06,015
They're gonna get the dope.

681
00:29:06,017 --> 00:29:07,483
If you can't control
the sale of the product,

682
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:09,151
how on Earth are you gonna

683
00:29:09,153 --> 00:29:10,886
keep it out of the hands
of kids?

684
00:29:10,888 --> 00:29:12,888
Could we be the creators
of what we now see

685
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,856
as some of our biggest problems?

686
00:29:14,858 --> 00:29:17,892
Have our solutions been prelude
to our worst fears?

687
00:29:17,894 --> 00:29:21,362
The use of the criminal law
for the basis of public health

688
00:29:21,364 --> 00:29:24,198
is a wholly bad idea,
no matter how you cut it.

689
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,101
It doesn't work-- you cannot
legislate morality.

690
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:30,803
One person can say
it's immoral to legalize it

691
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:32,771
just as much as someone can say

692
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,305
it's immoral not to legalize it.

693
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:35,773
It doesn't get you anywhere.

694
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,207
You have to have a rational
policy debate

695
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,975
by talking about
the consequences.

696
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,943
Now, I've had young people
tell me that,

697
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,178
"Well, your generation
had a martini,

698
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,246
"and that was your crutch,
and why can't we have

699
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:47,181
our own kind of crutch?"

700
00:29:47,183 --> 00:29:48,916
You know what?

701
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:51,018
Why don't you be a generation
that doesn't have to have

702
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,820
any kind of crutch?

703
00:29:53,822 --> 00:29:55,321
It's a lot easier argument
if you just say,

704
00:29:55,323 --> 00:29:57,256
"Oh, it's immoral."

705
00:29:57,258 --> 00:29:59,424
Then you don't have to debate
why it is that alcohol kills

706
00:29:59,426 --> 00:30:01,359
so many more people
than marijuana,

707
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:04,061
or why it is that tobacco
takes seven years off your life,

708
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:06,029
and we can't establish
that marijuana

709
00:30:06,031 --> 00:30:07,797
does anything particularly.

710
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,765
If people do do drugs
and they commit crimes

711
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,900
around those drugs, they should,
in fact, be punished.

712
00:30:11,902 --> 00:30:14,769
But you can't punish someone
for something that hurts no one.

713
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,037
We should legalize marijuana,
tax the hell out of it,

714
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,439
and put every dime back
into the health-care system.

715
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:23,442
Taxation and legalization?

716
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:25,444
Doesn't that seem
a little extreme?

717
00:30:25,446 --> 00:30:28,814
Wouldn't it be better to just
decriminalize?

718
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:31,383
The distinction is simple.

719
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:35,787
Legalization of marijuana
makes it a product

720
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:40,124
that is legally
available to adults.

721
00:30:40,126 --> 00:30:43,861
That doesn't mean that there's
unregulated distribution,

722
00:30:43,863 --> 00:30:46,563
unregulated sale
and unregulated use.

723
00:30:46,565 --> 00:30:49,132
The decriminalization
of marijuana

724
00:30:49,134 --> 00:30:51,167
still makes it an offense.

725
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:53,202
You're not gonna go
to jail for it

726
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:55,170
under a decriminalized model,

727
00:30:55,172 --> 00:30:57,338
but society is still
saying, "No, no, no, no."

728
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,174
It doesn't address the problems
of organized crime,

729
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:03,310
and it doesn't
create a situation

730
00:31:03,312 --> 00:31:05,278
where you have retail sales.

731
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,414
Decriminalization is just kind
of a goofy concept.

732
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,116
To say that it's legal
to own something, to use it,

733
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:14,119
to possess it, but not
to produce it or sell it,

734
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:17,021
just seems like this illogical
position because,

735
00:31:17,023 --> 00:31:18,856
where did this stuff come from?

736
00:31:18,858 --> 00:31:20,424
It's the worst of both worlds.

737
00:31:20,426 --> 00:31:22,359
It sends out an incredibly
bad message.

738
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:25,161
It should be controlled
like alcohol, like tobacco.

739
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:28,497
The total impact for the U.S.
budget from legalizing marijuana

740
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:31,333
and taxing it at rates like
alcohol and tobacco

741
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:34,169
is somewhere in
the 10 to $14 billion range.

742
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:36,404
It can be used to pay for
health-care costs,

743
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:38,239
it can be used
to rebate to lower taxes

744
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,040
and give people lower tax rates.

745
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:41,408
It can be used for highways,

746
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,276
for hospitals,
for national defense.

747
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,044
It's $14 billion,

748
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:47,479
and it can be used for whatever
its best use is.

749
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:50,582
The production or the
harvesting, the packaging,

750
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:53,484
the sales of marijuana
could be handled

751
00:31:53,486 --> 00:31:56,987
essentially the way
we handle alcohol.

752
00:31:56,989 --> 00:32:00,323
You sell to a kid, you sell
to somebody under the influence,

753
00:32:00,325 --> 00:32:02,558
your license is in jeopardy.

754
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,227
That license ought to be hard
to get and easy to lose.

755
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:07,295
It seems to make sense.

756
00:32:07,297 --> 00:32:09,130
It's a little jarring,

757
00:32:09,132 --> 00:32:12,166
but nowhere are these issues
more relevant than here in BC.

758
00:32:12,168 --> 00:32:14,501
Yes, marijuana is illegal here,

759
00:32:14,503 --> 00:32:18,204
and yes, police actively
pursue growers and dealers,

760
00:32:18,206 --> 00:32:21,073
but that doesn't stop the market
from thriving.

761
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:23,942
It's believed that the illegal
BC marijuana-trade industry

762
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:27,612
employs anywhere
from 90 to 150,000 people,

763
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:30,014
and the product is now known
around the world.

764
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:32,449
It's even been given
its own name.

765
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,950
BC bud.

766
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,984
Bud.

767
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,485
BC--
Bud.

768
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,253
British Columbia bud.

769
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:40,054
I don't know what
you are meaning.

770
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:41,889
BC-- BC bud? Bud?

771
00:32:41,891 --> 00:32:44,324
You guys know what BC bud is?
No.

772
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:46,392
You guys know where
British Columbia is?

773
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:48,560
No, isn't it in Britain?

774
00:32:48,562 --> 00:32:50,161
No, it's in Canada.

775
00:32:50,163 --> 00:32:52,196
When I say BC is famous for...
Pot.

776
00:32:52,198 --> 00:32:53,597
Weed and hippies.

777
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,399
Mountains, sea. Marijuana.

778
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,299
I usually think of
"The Beachcombers,"

779
00:32:57,301 --> 00:32:59,000
back in the days,

780
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:00,501
but now I just think of
that BC bud.

781
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:02,970
Do you know what BC bud is? No.

782
00:33:02,972 --> 00:33:05,205
Oh, it's really well-known.

783
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:08,274
BC bud is bud that
comes from British Columbia.

784
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:11,043
And that's why they call it
BC bud, or "beasters."

785
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:12,544
"Dude, you got the beasters?"

786
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:14,913
"Yeah, I got the beasters,"
which means you got bud from BC.

787
00:33:14,915 --> 00:33:17,148
You know what the word
"grow-op" is?

788
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,250
I'd say it's pretty common
knowledge here

789
00:33:19,252 --> 00:33:20,584
what a grow-op is.

790
00:33:20,586 --> 00:33:22,686
People do them in their houses,
in their basements.

791
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,487
I'm surprised it's not
in our dictionary.

792
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:26,622
A grow-op is something that
happens inside somebody's house,

793
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:28,590
like, one of our friends
or something,

794
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:30,525
and they just grow
weed inside their house.

795
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:32,393
Do you know anybody that's
growing marijuana?

796
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:35,362
I don't-- well, no.

797
00:33:35,364 --> 00:33:38,064
Kelowna...

798
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:40,433
my hometown.

799
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,668
With a population
of only 100,000,

800
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:46,371
Kelowna is said to house
well over 1,000 grow-ops.

801
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:49,207
A police officer stated
in the local paper,

802
00:33:49,209 --> 00:33:52,176
"If they were to bust one
grow-op every day for a year,

803
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:55,012
they would still be nowhere near
getting rid of them."

804
00:33:55,014 --> 00:33:57,547
And Kelowna is not alone.

805
00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:01,250
Where are they in BC--
They're everywhere.

806
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:03,485
They're in every single
corner of the province.

807
00:34:03,487 --> 00:34:05,553
There is no community
in the province

808
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:07,555
that doesn't have grows

809
00:34:07,557 --> 00:34:09,423
and hasn't had an increase
in grows.

810
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:11,558
The fact is that there's
thousands and thousands

811
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,294
and thousands of grow-ops
all over British Columbia,

812
00:34:14,296 --> 00:34:16,262
and the most common thing
you hear

813
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:18,430
when they raid a grow-op is--
From the neighbors is--

814
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:21,065
"I had no idea they were
growing pot on my street."

815
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:23,667
You know, if you actually took
my estimate seriously--

816
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:26,336
That there were 17,000
grow-ops in British Columbia

817
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:28,137
in the year 2000--

818
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,239
If you took that seriously,
you're looking at roughly

819
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:33,375
one out of every 100
dwelling units

820
00:34:33,377 --> 00:34:35,410
in British Columbia.

821
00:34:35,412 --> 00:34:38,579
We need to have a sense of that.

822
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:40,581
Not bad for a province
with a population

823
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:43,016
of only 4 million people.

824
00:34:43,018 --> 00:34:45,651
It's certainly changed a great
deal from the '70s and '80s

825
00:34:45,653 --> 00:34:48,120
when it was an import-
export business

826
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:51,289
to the domestic-production
business of the '90s and beyond.

827
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:53,257
That would make us
"Columbia North."

828
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,325
We're talking
a lot of production.

829
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,560
The reality is that there's
a huge range of people

830
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,095
involved in the marijuana
industry in British Columbia.

831
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,996
It's not a hierarchy.

832
00:35:01,998 --> 00:35:04,398
People don't beat you up if you
go into the marijuana industry.

833
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,801
It ranges from people
growing a few plants

834
00:35:06,803 --> 00:35:10,671
to members of motorcycle clubs
and others

835
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:13,306
possibly being
involved in the business.

836
00:35:13,308 --> 00:35:16,309
Police, at one time, used to
attend to every single call

837
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:18,244
that came to their attention.

838
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:19,878
Somebody would call and say,
"I think there's a grow-op."

839
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,512
Police would do an
investigation,

840
00:35:21,514 --> 00:35:23,113
do a full investigation.

841
00:35:23,115 --> 00:35:24,681
Well, that has dropped
over seven years

842
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:26,516
to where it's only
about half the time.

843
00:35:26,518 --> 00:35:29,385
But is seems to me that if we
look around and talk to people

844
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:31,553
who are living in
the real world,

845
00:35:31,555 --> 00:35:33,454
one of the things we discover

846
00:35:33,456 --> 00:35:35,556
is that we don't understand it
very well.

847
00:35:35,558 --> 00:35:37,157
And when we see these numbers,

848
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:40,460
like 1% of all dwelling units,
potentially,

849
00:35:40,462 --> 00:35:43,396
are involved in
marijuana grow-ops,

850
00:35:43,398 --> 00:35:47,199
it certainly ought to give our
politicians perspective

851
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:49,501
on what it is
they're trying to do.

852
00:35:49,503 --> 00:35:52,837
So how does one find
these grow-ops?

853
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:54,805
For police, it involves the use

854
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:56,873
of forward-looking
infrared cameras

855
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:59,842
that can detect the above-normal
heat radiating from a grow-op,

856
00:35:59,844 --> 00:36:02,678
or the sniff test.

857
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,281
But if all else fails, this--
Grow Watch.

858
00:36:06,283 --> 00:36:09,417
Communities have become so
flooded with grow-ops in BC

859
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:10,918
that some neighborhoods

860
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,786
have started their own
watch programs.

861
00:36:12,788 --> 00:36:15,355
This one, set up
by the Chilliwack RCMP,

862
00:36:15,357 --> 00:36:18,491
even has an education package
with phases, training,

863
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:21,694
neighborhood cooperation,
certification.

864
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:24,396
Once certified,
you are able to hang this sign

865
00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:26,364
which shows that you are
a neighborhood

866
00:36:26,366 --> 00:36:28,833
that does not approve of
marijuana grow operations.

867
00:36:28,835 --> 00:36:31,235
There are questions provided
to citizens

868
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:33,503
in order to aid them
in identifying a grow-op.

869
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:35,238
Questions like,

870
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,173
"Do the residents keep
to themselves?"

871
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:39,441
"Was the sound of construction
heard coming from the basement

872
00:36:39,443 --> 00:36:41,843
soon after occupants took over
the residence?"

873
00:36:41,845 --> 00:36:44,245
"Is there condensation
visible on the windows?"

874
00:36:44,247 --> 00:36:46,447
"Is the yard unkempt?"

875
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:49,516
The education package does state
that a positive response

876
00:36:49,518 --> 00:36:51,551
to one or some
of these questions

877
00:36:51,553 --> 00:36:53,386
does not necessarily indicate

878
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:55,921
that the residents are involved
in criminal activity.

879
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:58,657
Maybe that's a good thing.

880
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:00,558
But why is it that grow-ops
are popping up

881
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,593
in virtually
every neighborhood of BC?

882
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,461
How much money can
actually be made

883
00:37:04,463 --> 00:37:06,529
by simply growing some plants
in your basement?

884
00:37:06,531 --> 00:37:09,298
And what do these
grow-ops look like, anyway?

885
00:37:13,504 --> 00:37:14,903
We finally got a grower.

886
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:16,804
Right now,
we're driving to meet them.

887
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:18,806
It's around eight lights--
It's not a huge, huge show.

888
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:20,974
This is what they use for
clippers and stuff like that.

889
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:23,710
When they hire clippers to do
a show, you put these on,

890
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:25,878
and if people are
looking from the outside,

891
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,946
it just looks pretty much like
you're wearing sunglasses.

892
00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:29,681
But when you're on--

893
00:37:29,683 --> 00:37:31,649
I mean, I can't put them on
right now because I'm driving--

894
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:33,484
Won't be able to see.

895
00:37:33,486 --> 00:37:36,653
Everyone's getting glasses,
director, other producer.

896
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,388
Where's my phone?

897
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,523
We just wait for the phone call,
so keep in line

898
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:44,660
for when this comes to--
Oh, I see a vehicle pulled up.

899
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,794
Maybe that's them.

900
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:52,299
Hello?

901
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,470
Okay, so put the glasses on?

902
00:37:57,472 --> 00:37:59,222
Okay.

903
00:37:59,223 --> 00:38:00,973
Now, can you tell them
we're just gonna have

904
00:38:00,975 --> 00:38:02,641
the camera running, but we're
going to have the lens cap on--

905
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:04,242
Is that cool?

906
00:38:04,244 --> 00:38:05,843
Hey, Diggs, we're going
to have the camera running,

907
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:08,512
but we're going to have the
cap on so there's no video.

908
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:09,813
Shit.

909
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:11,581
Yeah, just do it,
just keep it on.

910
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,649
Just put the cap on.

911
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:15,784
How are you guys feeling?

912
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:17,986
Feel that heart rate increased?

913
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:25,925
You want the camera?

914
00:38:25,927 --> 00:38:27,526
Yeah, cool.

915
00:38:27,528 --> 00:38:29,427
You're not feeling
motion sickness?

916
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:31,394
Oh, yeah, now I am feeling--
I'm feeling sick.

917
00:38:34,732 --> 00:38:36,732
We're just gonna hold
people's arms

918
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:38,366
and kind of guide them inside.

919
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:39,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's what I was saying,

920
00:38:39,802 --> 00:38:42,402
so I don't fall on my face here.

921
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,923
A real grow-op.

922
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:08,793
The grower admitted that this
wasn't the biggest of grow-ops.

923
00:39:08,795 --> 00:39:13,063
In fact, it was probably on
the small end of the scale

924
00:39:13,065 --> 00:39:16,933
in terms of size...
but I really didn't care.

925
00:39:16,935 --> 00:39:19,635
There were just so many
things to see.

926
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:23,805
The lights,
the tools, the power,

927
00:39:23,807 --> 00:39:26,007
the pots...

928
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:29,744
and of course, the marijuana.

929
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:31,445
What do you guys do
for the smell?

930
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:33,046
I noticed there's a big--

931
00:39:33,048 --> 00:39:34,881
Well, we got this
carbon filter here, whatever,

932
00:39:34,883 --> 00:39:36,883
it just kind of filters
the air in there,

933
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:38,985
and then it goes
underneath the house,

934
00:39:38,987 --> 00:39:41,487
and we have it so it goes
into, like, a dog shed.

935
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:43,789
I'm in the beginning stage
and I'm learning.

936
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:48,893
Over here, there's
also another room in there.

937
00:39:48,895 --> 00:39:51,061
So you have a total of--
Is it eight lights?

938
00:39:51,063 --> 00:39:53,096
Eight lights, yeah,
they go on 12 hours.

939
00:39:53,098 --> 00:39:54,764
This one runs 12 hours
in the daytime.

940
00:39:54,766 --> 00:39:56,499
This one comes on
at 8:00 at night.

941
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:58,033
Would you say a majority
of the guys you know

942
00:39:58,035 --> 00:39:59,801
are just growing
to earn some extra money?

943
00:39:59,803 --> 00:40:01,836
Yeah, yeah, they have normal
jobs, and you know,

944
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,472
they're normal
9-to-5 type of guys.

945
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:08,741
The grower told me he cropped
out about every two months,

946
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:12,044
and every crop
was worth about $20,000.

947
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:14,713
That's $120,000 a year.

948
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:17,115
Even though this was
a small grow-op,

949
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:19,917
the numbers didn't
seem small at all.

950
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,485
If those kind of numbers

951
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,453
are coming out of a set-up
of eight lights,

952
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,954
what kind of numbers are
coming out of the big ones?

953
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,359
And where do you find them?

954
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:34,061
Well, it would seem
just about everywhere.

955
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:37,864
Barges, semi trucks.

956
00:40:37,866 --> 00:40:39,765
Whether it was for
the mobility of it

957
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:41,967
or whether it was an attempt
to disguise the smell

958
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:44,469
of growing marijuana,

959
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:47,571
in any event,
it's unusual for that reason.

960
00:40:49,775 --> 00:40:51,007
Even in...

961
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:54,777
...train cars?

962
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:57,713
Yes, it seems as though
even our beloved caboose

963
00:40:57,715 --> 00:40:59,915
cannot escape grow-op fever.

964
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:02,384
When we read that 20 train cars
were buried underground

965
00:41:02,386 --> 00:41:03,718
to grow marijuana,

966
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,421
busted or not,
we had to see this,

967
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,756
so we set out.

968
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,925
But not before asking our sound
man if we could use his SUV

969
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:16,061
and coaxing him
with a little free gas.

970
00:41:16,063 --> 00:41:19,130
Where we were going,
we would need it.

971
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,837
We're in the boondocks,
way up here.

972
00:41:31,577 --> 00:41:33,743
Wouldn't wanna
go over that puppy.

973
00:41:36,614 --> 00:41:38,180
This is what they brought up--

974
00:41:38,182 --> 00:41:40,482
Diesel fuel to power
the generators in.

975
00:41:40,484 --> 00:41:41,916
With how much they were growing

976
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:43,684
and how much the generators
needed,

977
00:41:43,686 --> 00:41:45,852
I mean, that's
a full truckload there.

978
00:41:45,854 --> 00:41:48,154
And finally, after a few hours
on the highway

979
00:41:48,156 --> 00:41:51,524
and climbing up the side
of a mountain, we get there.

980
00:41:51,526 --> 00:41:53,792
We had to go into four-low
just to get up here,

981
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:55,593
and you can see,
I'm dressed right.

982
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:57,061
I'm in jeans
and frickin' sneakers.

983
00:41:57,063 --> 00:41:59,196
Fuck...

984
00:41:59,198 --> 00:42:02,065
My feet are cold!

985
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:05,068
There's no neighbors--
Like, look to the right.

986
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,803
There's nobody there.

987
00:42:06,805 --> 00:42:08,504
Nobody here, nobody there.

988
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:11,807
I mean, I imaging they're
probably laid this way.

989
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,608
They've been obviously
following you,

990
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,142
like, where are
you getting your diesel?

991
00:42:15,144 --> 00:42:16,710
Where are you getting the tanks?

992
00:42:16,712 --> 00:42:18,511
Where do you
buy ten train carts?

993
00:42:18,513 --> 00:42:20,513
Where do you buy 150 lights?

994
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:22,982
These are diesel pumps,
and it looks like

995
00:42:22,984 --> 00:42:25,718
there's still diesel
leaking in these things here.

996
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,554
This is how you got down there.

997
00:42:28,556 --> 00:42:32,591
Just wanna make sure
it's okay to go down here.

998
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:35,527
Feel like I'm going into a cave.

999
00:42:35,529 --> 00:42:38,997
All right,
watch your feet there.

1000
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:40,932
Not as cold under here.

1001
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:44,669
About eight train carts down
that way, I'm guessing.

1002
00:42:44,671 --> 00:42:46,537
I can't even see to the end.

1003
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:48,739
And then two deep,
each one is two deep.

1004
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:50,807
Down here, two deep, down
the next one, two deep.

1005
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:54,243
Three, four,
there's numbers on the wall.

1006
00:42:54,245 --> 00:42:57,946
And then what they did is they
cut them to make doorways,

1007
00:42:57,948 --> 00:43:00,481
and that's how you have your
hallways going into each one.

1008
00:43:04,153 --> 00:43:07,988
There are water reservoirs here,
and you see one, two, three.

1009
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,023
You're like,
"Okay, that's quite a bit."

1010
00:43:10,025 --> 00:43:12,759
But then there's this one
and that one

1011
00:43:12,761 --> 00:43:14,761
and another one at the end.

1012
00:43:14,763 --> 00:43:16,863
Look at these things.

1013
00:43:16,865 --> 00:43:18,965
Like, no wonder the cops
just left it.

1014
00:43:18,967 --> 00:43:20,933
Moving this shit
would be a pain in the ass...

1015
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:24,937
These train carts, I see why
they bought them.

1016
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:26,672
They got a deal.

1017
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:29,141
They're all rusted
in the bottom.

1018
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:31,076
We could start
growing here tomorrow.

1019
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:33,211
There's still dirt and
fertilizer ready to go.

1020
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:36,047
Oh, here, who wants a little
leftover plant there?

1021
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:37,715
Look at this.

1022
00:43:37,717 --> 00:43:40,117
Look at all this wiring
right here.

1023
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:42,786
You can see the cops
have come, severed everything.

1024
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:48,190
What are those chains for?

1025
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,292
Chains are where they were
hanging the lights.

1026
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,993
Reason why they use the chains,

1027
00:43:51,995 --> 00:43:53,627
'cause then they
can adjust the height.

1028
00:43:53,629 --> 00:43:55,528
Actually, you wanna get me
a run all the way down

1029
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,247
to see how far away I am?

1030
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:58,965
So I'm going to go the end here
to show you how deep this is,

1031
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:01,634
and this was all filled
with plants.

1032
00:44:01,636 --> 00:44:04,903
Whoa, I'm at the end.

1033
00:44:04,905 --> 00:44:08,640
I can hardly see over there,
it's just like lights to me.

1034
00:44:08,642 --> 00:44:10,642
This is how far away, like,
to give you an idea

1035
00:44:10,644 --> 00:44:12,844
just how big this is.

1036
00:44:12,846 --> 00:44:16,414
God, it's a trek just to get
back to where you guys are.

1037
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:18,382
Now, you're gonna see
a lot of repetition,

1038
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:20,283
because here it goes again.

1039
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:22,051
Bang, all the way down.

1040
00:44:24,855 --> 00:44:27,689
When it said in the paper, 20,
it's probably--

1041
00:44:27,691 --> 00:44:31,025
It's gotta be ten long
and two deep each one,

1042
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:34,161
'cause then
you've got your 20 carts.

1043
00:44:34,163 --> 00:44:37,330
Man, I wish we could have seen
that while it was still rolling.

1044
00:44:37,332 --> 00:44:39,298
That is crazy.

1045
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:43,835
You wouldn't know
there's a law here.

1046
00:44:43,837 --> 00:44:46,270
Check this out--
Cannabis Day.

1047
00:44:46,272 --> 00:44:49,273
An actual day dedicated
to marijuana.

1048
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:52,743
And take note, this takes place

1049
00:44:52,745 --> 00:44:54,878
on one of the busiest,
high-traffic blocks

1050
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,847
of BC's largest city, Vancouver.

1051
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:00,716
Marijuana? It's everywhere.

1052
00:45:00,718 --> 00:45:03,418
Consumed and sold in every
imaginable way.

1053
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,754
Pipes, bongs,
joints, baked goods.

1054
00:45:06,756 --> 00:45:09,757
It was hard to imagine that
nearly every person

1055
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,126
attending this event
was breaking the law,

1056
00:45:12,128 --> 00:45:14,394
and yet no one seemed to care.

1057
00:45:14,396 --> 00:45:17,730
The police were there,
but not to bust people.

1058
00:45:17,732 --> 00:45:21,033
They held traffic for the band
to play for Cannabis Day.

1059
00:45:21,035 --> 00:45:23,735
Now they went back
to their side of the street.

1060
00:45:23,737 --> 00:45:26,070
- Sure, no problem, brother.
- Thank you very much.

1061
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:29,273
No problem--
Complying with the 5-0.

1062
00:45:29,275 --> 00:45:30,941
One of the organizers told me

1063
00:45:30,943 --> 00:45:33,076
that in all the years
this event has taken place,

1064
00:45:33,078 --> 00:45:36,746
there's never been a violent
incident, except once,

1065
00:45:36,748 --> 00:45:40,916
by a man who was believed to be
under the influence of alcohol.

1066
00:45:40,918 --> 00:45:42,951
We heard there was
a jazz festival

1067
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:45,753
happening at the same time
on the other side of the block.

1068
00:45:45,755 --> 00:45:48,088
It wasn't doing quite as well,

1069
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,023
but there was one group
doing all right.

1070
00:45:50,025 --> 00:45:51,824
Right up there, as you can see,

1071
00:45:51,826 --> 00:45:53,425
is still Cannabis Day going on,

1072
00:45:53,427 --> 00:45:56,728
but right here, not even a block
away, is a church retreat,

1073
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,763
and they're selling doughnuts.

1074
00:45:58,765 --> 00:46:00,965
I was like, "Well, what do you
guys think about the rally?"

1075
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,900
And they're like,
"We need to pray for them."

1076
00:46:02,902 --> 00:46:05,869
Then I was like, "You guys are
selling food for them, right?"

1077
00:46:05,871 --> 00:46:08,204
I'm sure they've sold record
amounts today, I guess, too,

1078
00:46:08,206 --> 00:46:09,905
so we'll see.

1079
00:46:09,907 --> 00:46:12,374
We'll get an interview here
shortly, hopefully.

1080
00:46:12,376 --> 00:46:15,810
The interview never came.

1081
00:46:15,812 --> 00:46:17,778
There was so much marijuana,
it was unbelievable.

1082
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,180
I think we almost
all got contact highs

1083
00:46:20,182 --> 00:46:22,849
just from being around
the smoke.

1084
00:46:22,851 --> 00:46:26,185
But I did get a doughnut.

1085
00:46:26,187 --> 00:46:28,453
I did purchase some of these
on the way out.

1086
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:31,122
Those church girls got me.

1087
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:34,058
A culture of marijuana
has been established in BC,

1088
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,261
from paraphernalia to cafés,

1089
00:46:37,263 --> 00:46:39,229
from seed selling,

1090
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:42,432
to its very own political party,
the BC Marijuana Party.

1091
00:46:42,434 --> 00:46:44,100
Even bakers.

1092
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,909
Hey, everybody, I'm Watermelon,

1093
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:56,911
and welcome to my
vaudeville cooking show,

1094
00:46:56,913 --> 00:46:58,812
"Baked and Baking,"

1095
00:46:58,814 --> 00:47:01,414
where we're gonna
revolutionize the cooking show,

1096
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:03,816
and we're gonna let you guys
in on the action.

1097
00:47:06,053 --> 00:47:08,253
Meet Watermelon Girl.

1098
00:47:08,255 --> 00:47:11,122
She's made a name for herself
as BC's only drug-dealing,

1099
00:47:11,124 --> 00:47:13,924
nudist, comic, pin-up baker.

1100
00:47:13,926 --> 00:47:16,393
Did I get all that in?

1101
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:19,796
She was arrested for selling her
cookies down on Wreck Beach--

1102
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:22,565
A nude beach...
is this for real?

1103
00:47:28,572 --> 00:47:30,172
I'm like the Heidi Fleiss
of weed.

1104
00:47:30,173 --> 00:47:32,239
I tell everybody, like,
lawyers, doctors, like,

1105
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:35,242
there's no proverbial,
"Yo, G," you know?

1106
00:47:35,244 --> 00:47:36,943
Like, none of those.

1107
00:47:36,945 --> 00:47:40,446
Like, all professionals come in
through my house, you know?

1108
00:47:40,448 --> 00:47:44,216
A lot of people with money,
a lot of people in politics.

1109
00:47:44,218 --> 00:47:46,418
You don't wanna know who
comes through here, you know.

1110
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,420
My mother was a baker,
and her mother was a baker,

1111
00:47:48,422 --> 00:47:50,388
and we just--
We just bake.

1112
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:52,923
So I made these pot cookies
and I started selling them.

1113
00:47:52,925 --> 00:47:55,992
It's hard to ignore
such a large demand.

1114
00:47:55,994 --> 00:47:58,160
So you got arrested one time
on Wreck Beach, right?

1115
00:47:58,162 --> 00:48:00,162
Yep, yeah, I've been
arrested more than once.

1116
00:48:00,164 --> 00:48:03,265
Allegedly trafficking
gingersnap cookies.

1117
00:48:03,267 --> 00:48:06,034
Allegedly trafficking
gingersnap cookies.

1118
00:48:06,036 --> 00:48:08,403
So I'm assuming not regular
gingersnap cookies, right?

1119
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:10,938
The one that packs,
"snap, crackle, pot"?

1120
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:14,274
But even the judge
was like, "Uh-huh."

1121
00:48:14,276 --> 00:48:16,142
You know what I mean,
like, he's just--

1122
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:18,477
He's seen violent crime
after violent crime,

1123
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:20,912
and then along
comes the cookie girl.

1124
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:23,314
Cops are supposed to come
and remove undesirables

1125
00:48:23,316 --> 00:48:25,983
from communities,
and I clearly was not

1126
00:48:25,985 --> 00:48:28,118
an undesirable person
in my community--

1127
00:48:29,454 --> 00:48:31,420
Uh, somebody else needs cookies.

1128
00:48:31,422 --> 00:48:33,989
Actually, I just got picked up
by the National Speakers Bureau,

1129
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:36,291
so I actually go on speaking
tours to universities

1130
00:48:36,293 --> 00:48:38,192
and talk to kids
about marijuana.

1131
00:48:38,194 --> 00:48:40,160
Oh, really?
Yes, like, the most genius--

1132
00:48:40,162 --> 00:48:42,162
I'm like, "You want me
to talk about marijuana?"

1133
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:44,197
Okay, and they pay me to do it.

1134
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:48,134
Lock up your kids,
this is a heinous crime.

1135
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,569
So at some point,
one might ask oneself,

1136
00:48:50,571 --> 00:48:52,470
how does an industry of this
size function

1137
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:54,438
while remaining illegal?

1138
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,541
Where does the money flow?
Who's profiting off of it?

1139
00:48:57,543 --> 00:48:59,309
Is there really $7 billion

1140
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,978
floating around the province
unaccounted for?

1141
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,646
Maybe people are
feeling the effects

1142
00:49:03,648 --> 00:49:05,547
and they don't even know it.

1143
00:49:05,549 --> 00:49:08,149
Turns out there seems
to be a system.

1144
00:49:08,151 --> 00:49:10,985
Some have even
given this system a name.

1145
00:49:10,987 --> 00:49:13,220
Well, a lot of people here
in town and stuff

1146
00:49:13,222 --> 00:49:14,921
consider it a union.

1147
00:49:14,923 --> 00:49:16,989
Union?
Yeah, a union, and you know,

1148
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:21,492
it's like a different term
for pretty much "industry."

1149
00:49:21,494 --> 00:49:23,560
It's this underground thing

1150
00:49:23,562 --> 00:49:25,428
where there's so many
different tradesmen

1151
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,363
and different people
all working together.

1152
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:29,898
You have to work together
with people that you trust,

1153
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,901
because it's illegal to do what
people are doing here.

1154
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,904
So this is how the so-called
union breaks down,

1155
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,039
and of course, there
are many exceptions to this,

1156
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,241
but this is the typical set-up.

1157
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,309
First you have
a home or landowner.

1158
00:49:42,311 --> 00:49:45,178
He doesn't take on much
responsibility.

1159
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,146
He is simply
the legitimate owner

1160
00:49:47,148 --> 00:49:49,448
of where the grow operation
will take place.

1161
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,983
All he has to do is pick up
a briefcase every three months

1162
00:49:51,985 --> 00:49:53,551
and pay off his mortgage.

1163
00:49:53,553 --> 00:49:55,386
His hands are clean because
he can claim ignorance

1164
00:49:55,388 --> 00:49:57,454
if the grow operation is busted.

1165
00:49:57,456 --> 00:49:59,289
"Oh, I'm sorry, Officer,

1166
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:01,357
I didn't know they were
growing marijuana there."

1167
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,293
Then you have his 50-50 partner,
the contractor,

1168
00:50:04,295 --> 00:50:06,028
who will provide the equipment

1169
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:08,263
and hire the grower
or grow himself.

1170
00:50:08,265 --> 00:50:10,698
The grower
is known as the fall guy.

1171
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,166
Why the name?

1172
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:14,067
Because that's exactly
what he is.

1173
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:16,669
If the operation
is busted, he takes the fall.

1174
00:50:16,671 --> 00:50:19,405
Once the crop has matured,
clippers are then hired.

1175
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:21,373
They prep the weed
for distribution

1176
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:23,708
by cutting away the excess
leaves and stems.

1177
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,643
What a lot of
people don't understand

1178
00:50:25,645 --> 00:50:27,378
is the part of the
marijuana plant

1179
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,046
that people smoke is the bud,

1180
00:50:29,048 --> 00:50:30,947
which in essence
is the plant's flower.

1181
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:32,682
It's not the leaves.

1182
00:50:32,684 --> 00:50:34,583
Clippers are generally
hired on an hourly wage

1183
00:50:34,585 --> 00:50:38,053
starting around $20,
tax-free, of course.

1184
00:50:38,055 --> 00:50:41,356
Once the marijuana is ready,
in steps the weed broker.

1185
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:42,990
He's not always required,

1186
00:50:42,992 --> 00:50:44,658
but sometimes the partner
with the equipment needs

1187
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,560
a broker to buy his product
and then sell it for him.

1188
00:50:47,562 --> 00:50:49,695
In the event that
a broker is required,

1189
00:50:49,697 --> 00:50:51,430
it usually means the weed
is headed south

1190
00:50:51,432 --> 00:50:53,432
to the United States.

1191
00:50:53,434 --> 00:50:55,434
In that case,
the broker will buy the pot

1192
00:50:55,436 --> 00:50:58,503
for somewhere between 1,800
and 2,000 a pound.

1193
00:50:58,505 --> 00:51:02,173
He'll then hire
a border jumper, a risk-taker,

1194
00:51:02,175 --> 00:51:04,275
someone who has the balls
and hopefully the wits

1195
00:51:04,277 --> 00:51:06,644
to get the product
over the border.

1196
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,113
Some of the most common ways?

1197
00:51:13,552 --> 00:51:15,718
The border jumper's fee varies
with each trip,

1198
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,153
but they're always well-paid.

1199
00:51:18,155 --> 00:51:20,522
Once the product has reached
the broker's U.S. connection,

1200
00:51:20,524 --> 00:51:23,324
it will earn about
$3,000 a pound.

1201
00:51:23,326 --> 00:51:25,693
The farther south
it goes, the more it makes.

1202
00:51:25,695 --> 00:51:28,028
If it manages to make it
all the way out east

1203
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:30,697
to areas like New York,
the price is driven even higher,

1204
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:34,434
somewhere between 3,500
and $6,000 a pound.

1205
00:51:34,436 --> 00:51:36,702
Stricter laws
demand higher prices

1206
00:51:36,704 --> 00:51:39,104
and in turn provide
more profits.

1207
00:51:39,106 --> 00:51:41,573
In Miami, seven
to eight pounds of BC bud

1208
00:51:41,575 --> 00:51:44,275
will trade for one kilo
of pure yayo--

1209
00:51:44,277 --> 00:51:46,777
Cocaine.

1210
00:51:46,779 --> 00:51:50,147
That in turn makes its way back
up to Canada-- eh?--

1211
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:54,484
And sells for anywhere
from 30 to $35,000 a key.

1212
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,320
If the marijuana manages to stay
in the province,

1213
00:51:57,322 --> 00:52:00,656
it will usually sell for
around 1,800 to $2,000 a pound,

1214
00:52:00,658 --> 00:52:03,058
depending on how flooded
the market is.

1215
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,193
This is just
the tip of the iceberg.

1216
00:52:05,195 --> 00:52:07,662
The union embodies a slew of
businesses and services,

1217
00:52:07,664 --> 00:52:11,465
generating profits both directly
and indirectly for the province.

1218
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:13,233
Some know they are involved,

1219
00:52:13,235 --> 00:52:15,201
and others choose not to
acknowledge the benefits

1220
00:52:15,203 --> 00:52:16,669
they gain from it.

1221
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:18,804
Carpenters build tables,
rooms, sheds,

1222
00:52:18,806 --> 00:52:21,506
and anything else
that's needed for a grow show.

1223
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:24,609
Brand-new homes are being built
expressly for the purpose

1224
00:52:24,611 --> 00:52:27,545
of housing
a marijuana grow operation.

1225
00:52:27,547 --> 00:52:30,347
Electricians set up lights,
wire the electrical components,

1226
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:32,415
divert power if necessary.

1227
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:34,450
Hardware stores provide
construction materials

1228
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:36,752
to build rooms
and grow-operation structures.

1229
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:40,055
Hydroponics stores supply
lights, nutrients, soil,

1230
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:42,090
and other equipment
needed to grow.

1231
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,459
Seed sellers
provide, well, seeds.

1232
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:47,094
Clone growers create clones
from other marijuana plants

1233
00:52:47,096 --> 00:52:49,396
to aid in quicker growth cycles.

1234
00:52:49,398 --> 00:52:52,699
Real-estate agencies market
houses to growers, unknowingly,

1235
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:54,600
but they profit all the same.

1236
00:52:54,602 --> 00:52:56,402
There are some Realtors, though,

1237
00:52:56,404 --> 00:52:58,270
who are directly
involved in the union

1238
00:52:58,272 --> 00:52:59,904
and will actually cater
to growers' needs,

1239
00:52:59,906 --> 00:53:02,673
finding houses in secluded areas
with big basements

1240
00:53:02,675 --> 00:53:05,542
and power that
can be spliced and stolen.

1241
00:53:05,544 --> 00:53:07,310
Mortgage brokers
and lease brokers

1242
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:08,878
who help growers with
poor credit

1243
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,946
get the houses
they need to start up.

1244
00:53:10,948 --> 00:53:13,214
Banks who have minimal security

1245
00:53:13,216 --> 00:53:15,516
to prevent illegal money
from being deposited.

1246
00:53:15,518 --> 00:53:18,252
The way it works now is deposits
over $3,000

1247
00:53:18,254 --> 00:53:20,387
are sometimes questioned
but are left up to the teller

1248
00:53:20,389 --> 00:53:22,956
to decide whether the deposit
is suspicious.

1249
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:25,925
If they believe it is, they
may put a note on the account.

1250
00:53:25,927 --> 00:53:28,427
It isn't until a $10,000 deposit

1251
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:32,664
that a mandatory FCAC form
is filled out and sent away,

1252
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:37,534
but it is possible for $9,999
deposits to go through

1253
00:53:37,536 --> 00:53:39,536
with little question.

1254
00:53:39,538 --> 00:53:41,604
"Oh, you sold some
motorbikes-- cool."

1255
00:53:41,606 --> 00:53:44,807
"Oh, you sold your boat, neat,
thanks for the business."

1256
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:46,642
You get the point.

1257
00:53:46,644 --> 00:53:48,677
Lawyers and law firms
provide counseling

1258
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:50,812
on how to make grow money legit.

1259
00:53:50,814 --> 00:53:53,247
They help set up and incorporate
LTD companies

1260
00:53:53,249 --> 00:53:55,415
and holding companies
to launder money.

1261
00:53:55,417 --> 00:53:57,350
They also provide legal counsel

1262
00:53:57,352 --> 00:53:59,418
to keep busted growers
out of jail.

1263
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,420
The electric company
who makes money

1264
00:54:01,422 --> 00:54:03,922
off of enlarged electric bills
due to excess lights.

1265
00:54:03,924 --> 00:54:05,823
The only time
they seem to get involved

1266
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,725
is when they think someone
is stealing the power.

1267
00:54:08,727 --> 00:54:12,395
Law enforcement receives budgets
to fight the cultivation.

1268
00:54:12,397 --> 00:54:14,563
They create special task forces,

1269
00:54:14,565 --> 00:54:17,799
like the Green Team, to
specifically target marijuana.

1270
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:20,501
Canadians spend 3 to
500 million annually

1271
00:54:20,503 --> 00:54:22,436
on law enforcement
and the justice system

1272
00:54:22,438 --> 00:54:24,704
to enforce marijuana laws.

1273
00:54:24,706 --> 00:54:26,639
Police also receive the benefits
of seizing

1274
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:29,408
growers' and dealers' assets.

1275
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:32,811
And last but definitely
not least,

1276
00:54:32,813 --> 00:54:35,413
everyday businesses--

1277
00:54:35,415 --> 00:54:37,681
Bars, restaurants,
clothing stores,

1278
00:54:37,683 --> 00:54:39,949
boat dealerships,
car dealerships--

1279
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:41,750
The money funneled indirectly

1280
00:54:41,752 --> 00:54:43,718
through various everyday
businesses.

1281
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,421
Growers and dealers like
to spend money on everything.

1282
00:54:47,423 --> 00:54:49,556
These growers,
after they crop out,

1283
00:54:49,558 --> 00:54:51,424
it's like they won the lottery.

1284
00:54:51,426 --> 00:54:53,292
You can tell the ones
who are selling it.

1285
00:54:53,294 --> 00:54:55,260
The more they sell, the more
bling-bling they have on them.

1286
00:54:55,262 --> 00:54:56,794
You think they just hold it
themselves

1287
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:58,395
and tuck it away somewhere?

1288
00:54:58,397 --> 00:55:00,964
No, they buy houses,
they buy cars, they buy boats.

1289
00:55:00,966 --> 00:55:03,499
They'll purchase restaurants,
they'll purchase--

1290
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:05,033
You know, I mean,
whatever they're into.

1291
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,335
Maybe that's why we got busted,
got too carried away.

1292
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,936
You can tell yourself
you're not gonna

1293
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,405
let it go to your head,
but I said the same thing.

1294
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,373
But when the money
comes in so easy,

1295
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:14,907
you get accustomed to
that lifestyle,

1296
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:16,675
and before you know it,

1297
00:55:16,677 --> 00:55:18,610
you become a steamer,
you become a hot rod.

1298
00:55:18,612 --> 00:55:20,645
And that's what
it comes down to.

1299
00:55:20,647 --> 00:55:22,813
Yes, organized crime moves
a majority of the product

1300
00:55:22,815 --> 00:55:24,815
once it's available
on the market,

1301
00:55:24,817 --> 00:55:27,651
but there aren't a lot of bikers
out there watering plants.

1302
00:55:27,653 --> 00:55:29,352
It's ma-and-pa operations,

1303
00:55:29,354 --> 00:55:31,387
it's young guys
who see opportunity.

1304
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:34,356
It's not easy to make that type
of money doing anything,

1305
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:36,424
especially if you've
been going to school

1306
00:55:36,426 --> 00:55:39,794
for the past four years and you
see this random other guy,

1307
00:55:39,796 --> 00:55:42,730
you know, watering plants
in his basement,

1308
00:55:42,732 --> 00:55:46,700
coming out of it with
an extreme amount of money.

1309
00:55:46,702 --> 00:55:49,002
Interesting, you had your degree.
Yeah.

1310
00:55:49,004 --> 00:55:51,371
And then you're in the--

1311
00:55:51,373 --> 00:55:53,773
Yeah, I made the choice
to put that aside

1312
00:55:53,775 --> 00:55:55,508
and start growing weed.

1313
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:57,543
I could be making
33 bucks an hour,

1314
00:55:57,545 --> 00:55:59,678
which is a great wage,
but, really?

1315
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,081
Why would I wanna do
that when I have the knowledge

1316
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:07,085
to make in a whole year,
in two months?

1317
00:56:07,087 --> 00:56:09,720
What have we learned so far?

1318
00:56:09,722 --> 00:56:12,689
Well, one, the Prohibition
hasn't reduced the demand,

1319
00:56:12,691 --> 00:56:15,658
and it certainly hasn't reduced
the supply.

1320
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,561
Two, it's a steady source of
revenue for organized crime,

1321
00:56:19,563 --> 00:56:21,496
which in turn attracts
young people

1322
00:56:21,498 --> 00:56:23,464
because the money is so easy.

1323
00:56:23,466 --> 00:56:25,899
And three,
being an underground market

1324
00:56:25,901 --> 00:56:28,534
actually creates crime
and violence.

1325
00:56:28,536 --> 00:56:32,070
And yet, the only one paying
the costs for all of this

1326
00:56:32,072 --> 00:56:35,339
are the taxpayers,
people like you and me.

1327
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:38,075
Even further, this whole deal
is over a drug

1328
00:56:38,077 --> 00:56:40,110
that seems to pose
no more of a threat

1329
00:56:40,112 --> 00:56:42,846
than the substances we
already regulate.

1330
00:56:42,848 --> 00:56:46,783
At the very least,
why isn't this up for debate?

1331
00:56:46,785 --> 00:56:50,553
Dwight Eisenhower once spoke of
a military-industrial complex.

1332
00:56:50,555 --> 00:56:53,956
Have we built up a marijuana
Prohibition complex?

1333
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:57,092
The real war on marijuana
didn't start until 1972,

1334
00:56:57,094 --> 00:57:01,362
and President Nixon, he said
it's all the Jews smoking pot.

1335
00:57:01,364 --> 00:57:03,364
I mean, he really said that.

1336
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:05,532
When Nixon got into this
with his War on Drugs,

1337
00:57:05,534 --> 00:57:08,001
he had things
that he wanted to do.

1338
00:57:08,003 --> 00:57:09,903
He had an agenda.

1339
00:57:09,904 --> 00:57:11,804
A lot of the information that
was kept and warehoused

1340
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:14,740
in the Library of Congress
and also at major universities,

1341
00:57:14,742 --> 00:57:16,942
was actually recalled
and destroyed...

1342
00:57:16,944 --> 00:57:20,512
The Nixon report that came out
through his administration

1343
00:57:20,514 --> 00:57:21,980
was called the Shafer Report.

1344
00:57:21,982 --> 00:57:24,415
It was by a Republican governor,

1345
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:26,083
and when he studied it
and gave an ounce for it,

1346
00:57:26,085 --> 00:57:28,952
"You can pick this report up,
pick up any page, open it,

1347
00:57:28,954 --> 00:57:31,487
"and if you actually have
experience with cannabis,

1348
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,789
you'll realize
they're telling the truth."

1349
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:35,857
And then when it came back
saying that marijuana

1350
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:37,758
was essentially harmless,
he totally ignored it, said,

1351
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,493
"We're going to launch a War
on Drugs, anyways."

1352
00:57:39,495 --> 00:57:41,561
They didn't
even print as many copies

1353
00:57:41,563 --> 00:57:43,796
that Congress and the House
would have been able to see.

1354
00:57:43,798 --> 00:57:47,065
1970, beginning of
the War on Drugs.

1355
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:51,402
76 New Jersey troopers became
detectives-- I was one of them.

1356
00:57:51,404 --> 00:57:53,837
They designated 1/3 of us
undercover.

1357
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,672
I happened to fall in that 1/3.

1358
00:57:55,674 --> 00:57:57,940
That's where I spent
the next 14 years of my life.

1359
00:57:57,942 --> 00:58:01,410
What we were targeted on
was the pot smokers.

1360
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:02,944
There was a very good reason

1361
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,779
we were targeted on
the pot smokers.

1362
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:07,481
Most of them were protesting
against the Vietnam War.

1363
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:10,784
If you could arrest
that whole group of people

1364
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:13,453
because they were smoking pot,

1365
00:58:13,455 --> 00:58:17,190
you didn't have to have
a Vietnam War protest,

1366
00:58:17,192 --> 00:58:20,927
which Mr. Nixon thought
was a pretty good idea.

1367
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:23,029
So when President Nixon declared
this civil war

1368
00:58:23,031 --> 00:58:24,764
that we're living in right now,

1369
00:58:24,766 --> 00:58:28,768
the drug war, in 1972, it was
really a war on marijuana.

1370
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:31,637
It really didn't kick in
until the '80s when Reagan,

1371
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:34,673
you know, took over his
presidency of the U.S.

1372
00:58:34,675 --> 00:58:36,207
Ronald Reagan, he said,

1373
00:58:36,209 --> 00:58:39,009
"These young people,
they get together,

1374
00:58:39,011 --> 00:58:43,480
they read books, they smoke
marijuana, and they talk."

1375
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:46,816
Like these three elements
were a recipe for disaster.

1376
00:58:46,818 --> 00:58:49,151
How do I feel about
legalizing marijuana?

1377
00:58:49,153 --> 00:58:51,953
Am I for it or against it?

1378
00:58:51,955 --> 00:58:54,855
I am totally against
legalizing marijuana.

1379
00:58:57,526 --> 00:58:59,659
Make no mistake,
the U.S. government,

1380
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:02,561
the focus of their War on Drugs
is cannabis.

1381
00:59:02,563 --> 00:59:05,697
The focus of
their rhetoric is cannabis.

1382
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:09,667
It's certainly used as a poster
child for all drugs.

1383
00:59:09,669 --> 00:59:12,002
When you see an ad for drugs,

1384
00:59:12,004 --> 00:59:13,937
it's always the marijuana leaf
that goes up.

1385
00:59:13,939 --> 00:59:16,706
It's almost like
a religious jihad.

1386
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:20,075
More powerful than going
for the gusto.

1387
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:24,812
It causes people to think-- when
people think, they question,

1388
00:59:24,814 --> 00:59:26,947
they question things like,
say, the war in Vietnam

1389
00:59:26,949 --> 00:59:29,516
or race separation
of blacks and whites,

1390
00:59:29,518 --> 00:59:31,684
like they did in the '30s
in the jazz clubs,

1391
00:59:31,686 --> 00:59:34,887
or women's rights,
or the Gulf War or oil wars.

1392
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:39,024
It's real simple.

1393
00:59:39,026 --> 00:59:41,026
You put your loafers on,
you put your black socks on,

1394
00:59:41,028 --> 00:59:42,861
you get in your car, you have
your briefcase,

1395
00:59:42,863 --> 00:59:44,596
you say "hi" to your neighbors.

1396
00:59:44,598 --> 00:59:46,164
He mows his lawn
just like you do,

1397
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,899
and things keep moving along
in the same direction

1398
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:49,533
they always have been.

1399
00:59:49,535 --> 00:59:51,535
That's why marijuana laws exist.

1400
00:59:51,537 --> 00:59:53,570
There are, in my opinion,
people in government,

1401
00:59:53,572 --> 00:59:55,138
at all levels of government,

1402
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:56,973
who know that it's not
a winnable war,

1403
00:59:56,975 --> 00:59:58,808
and yet they
continue to pursue it.

1404
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:01,944
Acceptance of drug use
is simply not an option

1405
01:00:01,946 --> 01:00:03,512
for this administration.

1406
01:00:03,514 --> 01:00:05,213
Often, we go to debates,

1407
01:00:05,215 --> 01:00:07,048
and it's a police officer
debating us.

1408
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,916
Okay, the police are
supposed to enforce the laws.

1409
01:00:08,918 --> 01:00:10,884
They should not be arguing
for or against laws.

1410
01:00:10,886 --> 01:00:12,552
That's not their job.

1411
01:00:12,554 --> 01:00:13,953
Well, what is their job?

1412
01:00:13,955 --> 01:00:16,221
Is it to enforce laws
that exist on the books

1413
01:00:16,223 --> 01:00:20,091
or to determine the policy of
the laws that are made?

1414
01:00:20,093 --> 01:00:22,593
The way to justify the policy
is to create a lot of fear

1415
01:00:22,595 --> 01:00:25,295
and then spend a lot of money
combating that.

1416
01:00:25,297 --> 01:00:27,930
Quite frankly, if you
took the using population

1417
01:00:27,932 --> 01:00:30,532
of all the other illegal
drugs combined

1418
01:00:30,534 --> 01:00:33,034
and you eliminated
cannabis from that equation,

1419
01:00:33,036 --> 01:00:35,803
there wouldn't be a big enough
drug problem

1420
01:00:35,805 --> 01:00:37,771
in either this country
or the United States

1421
01:00:37,773 --> 01:00:40,640
to justify
the massive expenditures

1422
01:00:40,642 --> 01:00:42,808
that go towards fighting
the war.

1423
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,743
The amazing thing is

1424
01:00:44,745 --> 01:00:47,645
a small amount of enforcement
is necessary.

1425
01:00:55,187 --> 01:00:57,987
$400 million
is spent annually in Canada

1426
01:00:57,989 --> 01:01:01,056
arresting and prosecuting
marijuana crimes.

1427
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:04,325
The total budget
in Canada for all drugs

1428
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,860
is $500 million.

1429
01:01:06,862 --> 01:01:09,095
That means 4/5
of the drug budget

1430
01:01:09,097 --> 01:01:12,264
goes towards arresting and
prosecuting marijuana users,

1431
01:01:12,266 --> 01:01:17,002
leaving 1/5 for crack,
heroin, coke,

1432
01:01:17,004 --> 01:01:20,405
crystal meth,
the date-rape drug, whatever.

1433
01:01:20,407 --> 01:01:23,408
The drug-enforcement industry
is big business.

1434
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:27,111
It's self-perpetuating,
it relies on taxpayer dollars.

1435
01:01:27,113 --> 01:01:30,180
And so it's an endless battle
that the DEA doesn't win,

1436
01:01:30,182 --> 01:01:32,015
they participate in.

1437
01:01:32,017 --> 01:01:34,250
It's like doing
a big-budget movie, you know.

1438
01:01:34,252 --> 01:01:37,453
You get $30 million
to do a movie,

1439
01:01:37,455 --> 01:01:41,290
and then the movie comes out
and it doesn't make any money,

1440
01:01:41,292 --> 01:01:44,092
but someone made $30 million.

1441
01:01:44,094 --> 01:01:46,194
Every once in awhile,
they'll show a guy posing

1442
01:01:46,196 --> 01:01:48,729
beside a big bunch of marijuana.

1443
01:01:48,731 --> 01:01:51,398
You know, "This is
the DEA money at work."

1444
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,967
It would be like asking loggers
about saving trees,

1445
01:01:53,969 --> 01:01:55,969
you know what I mean?

1446
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,970
This is where their mainstay of
their cash flow comes from.

1447
01:01:57,973 --> 01:01:59,806
The campaign will continue

1448
01:01:59,808 --> 01:02:04,010
until every available known
plot of marijuana

1449
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,444
has been eradicated.

1450
01:02:05,446 --> 01:02:08,313
We've got to live with it
doing the best job we can.

1451
01:02:08,315 --> 01:02:10,915
Even if it's a bad job?

1452
01:02:10,917 --> 01:02:13,918
We're all carrying a pretty
impossible load, Ms. Gibson.

1453
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,054
There are many, many police
officers, however,

1454
01:02:17,056 --> 01:02:19,322
who believe that
it ought to be legalized,

1455
01:02:19,324 --> 01:02:21,290
regulated and controlled.

1456
01:02:21,292 --> 01:02:24,059
They see the hypocrisy between
our existing laws

1457
01:02:24,061 --> 01:02:26,461
relating to
alcohol and marijuana

1458
01:02:26,463 --> 01:02:28,763
in their day-to-day life...

1459
01:02:28,765 --> 01:02:31,766
shift after shift after shift,
and they get it.

1460
01:02:31,768 --> 01:02:34,168
But they don't
wanna lose their jobs.

1461
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:36,770
They don't wanna lose that
promotion to sergeant

1462
01:02:36,772 --> 01:02:38,972
or the assignment to detectives.

1463
01:02:38,974 --> 01:02:41,007
They wanna be a chief someday,

1464
01:02:41,009 --> 01:02:43,909
and they don't wanna piss off
the people in power.

1465
01:02:43,911 --> 01:02:46,945
Judges, lawyers, prosecutors,
defense lawyers,

1466
01:02:46,947 --> 01:02:49,113
prison guards.

1467
01:02:49,115 --> 01:02:52,049
There's all of those people in
the criminal-justice industry.

1468
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:53,917
Are their interests
being protected?

1469
01:02:53,919 --> 01:02:55,985
Well, in a sense, yes, they are.

1470
01:02:55,987 --> 01:02:58,387
Defense bar, similarly--
We make money.

1471
01:02:58,389 --> 01:03:01,456
The more things they prohibit,
the more money we make.

1472
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:04,759
Sorry I'm late, Kent,
I was delayed in court.

1473
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:07,194
You still have
large numbers of people

1474
01:03:07,196 --> 01:03:09,029
being busted for simple
possession.

1475
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:11,898
If you look at the stats
in terms of drug offenses,

1476
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,901
the largest group are still
simple possession of marijuana.

1477
01:03:14,903 --> 01:03:17,470
Every time you blow
a marijuana cigarette,

1478
01:03:17,472 --> 01:03:19,805
you take a chance on
blowing your future.

1479
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,440
Oh, come on, Pop,
all my friends smoke pot.

1480
01:03:22,442 --> 01:03:24,308
They're not criminals.

1481
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:27,044
Only because they
haven't been caught yet.

1482
01:03:27,046 --> 01:03:29,780
If you do drugs,
you will be caught,

1483
01:03:29,782 --> 01:03:34,050
and when you're caught,
you will be punished.

1484
01:03:34,052 --> 01:03:38,987
750,000 Americans every year
are charged with pot possession.

1485
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:41,055
That's nearly a million people,

1486
01:03:41,057 --> 01:03:42,956
and whether you go to jail
or not,

1487
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:45,358
your life is in serious trouble.

1488
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,793
And that number of annual
arrests for marijuana

1489
01:03:47,795 --> 01:03:51,163
now rivals the number of arrests
for murder, rape, robbery,

1490
01:03:51,165 --> 01:03:54,866
and aggravated assault...
combined.

1491
01:03:54,868 --> 01:03:57,835
You will<i> never</i>
get over a conviction.

1492
01:03:57,837 --> 01:04:00,037
A conviction will track you
every day

1493
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:02,372
for the rest of your life.

1494
01:04:02,374 --> 01:04:05,375
For instance, you remember
that guy that used to smoke

1495
01:04:05,377 --> 01:04:08,911
but didn't inhale--
Former President Bill Clinton.

1496
01:04:08,913 --> 01:04:10,479
This is not a big issue with me.

1497
01:04:10,481 --> 01:04:12,080
I never even had a drink
of whiskey till I was 22.

1498
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:15,249
Now, if Mr. Clinton handed me
that marijuana cigarette

1499
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:17,517
when he was standing
in a circle with us,

1500
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,286
it wouldn't have mattered
whether he had inhaled or not,

1501
01:04:20,288 --> 01:04:22,121
he would have become a dope
dealer, wouldn't he?

1502
01:04:22,123 --> 01:04:24,223
Just like all those other people
that went to jail,

1503
01:04:24,225 --> 01:04:26,058
never to be an attorney,

1504
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:29,194
much less the president
of the United States.

1505
01:04:29,196 --> 01:04:31,196
But the marijuana laws
protect us.

1506
01:04:31,198 --> 01:04:33,264
They make our lives safer.

1507
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:36,100
They send us
the correct moral message.

1508
01:04:36,102 --> 01:04:38,268
That's how 19 out of 21 nations

1509
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:40,169
have gone down the drain
before us.

1510
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:41,904
Internal decay.

1511
01:04:41,906 --> 01:04:43,372
The breakdown of moral, ethical

1512
01:04:43,374 --> 01:04:45,040
and religious principles.

1513
01:04:45,042 --> 01:04:47,442
If you've been caught,
a young person in the U.S.,

1514
01:04:47,444 --> 01:04:49,510
with so much as one
marijuana cigarette,

1515
01:04:49,512 --> 01:04:51,845
you can't get a loan
or a grant from the government

1516
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:53,913
to go to college.

1517
01:04:53,915 --> 01:04:56,548
If you've been convicted of
murdering somebody

1518
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:59,450
or raping someone,
no problem, you go right down,

1519
01:04:59,452 --> 01:05:01,285
they'll give you the loan.

1520
01:05:01,287 --> 01:05:04,221
I guess the message is it's okay
to rape and murder and pillage,

1521
01:05:04,223 --> 01:05:06,923
just don't smoke a joint
afterwards.

1522
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:10,293
First thing that
John Ashcroft did after 9-1-1,

1523
01:05:10,295 --> 01:05:13,062
sent out a strike force
to take down

1524
01:05:13,064 --> 01:05:16,198
the LA Cannabis Buyers Co-op.

1525
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,168
That really helped national
security a great deal.

1526
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:22,937
And what else
helps national security?

1527
01:05:22,939 --> 01:05:25,406
Taking down top criminal
targets.

1528
01:05:25,408 --> 01:05:29,543
In 2003, the U.S. government
put aside money to do just that.

1529
01:05:29,545 --> 01:05:32,345
25 million for the head
of Osama bin Laden,

1530
01:05:32,347 --> 01:05:35,047
$15 million each
for the whereabouts

1531
01:05:35,049 --> 01:05:39,117
of Uday and Qusay Hussein,
Saddam's sons,

1532
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:41,219
and a $12 million budget

1533
01:05:41,221 --> 01:05:44,555
to go after one of the most
dangerous men of all...

1534
01:05:44,557 --> 01:05:47,591
this man.

1535
01:05:47,593 --> 01:05:49,926
Can you tell us what exactly
you were charged with?

1536
01:05:49,928 --> 01:05:52,995
I was charged with conspiring
to sell paraphernalia.

1537
01:05:52,997 --> 01:05:54,997
Operation Pipe Dreams

1538
01:05:54,999 --> 01:05:59,901
was a brainstorm of
Attorney General John Ashcroft.

1539
01:05:59,903 --> 01:06:02,203
The Internet has been
illegally utilized

1540
01:06:02,205 --> 01:06:04,271
to sell these illegal products

1541
01:06:04,273 --> 01:06:06,439
and to facilitate large
illegal businesses

1542
01:06:06,441 --> 01:06:08,541
operating in the open.

1543
01:06:08,543 --> 01:06:10,910
A sting operation
that busted people

1544
01:06:10,912 --> 01:06:13,178
for selling paraphernalia

1545
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:15,580
to a particular county
in Pennsylvania

1546
01:06:15,582 --> 01:06:17,915
where they were
willing to prosecute.

1547
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:20,017
Because there's two states,
Pennsylvania, Iowa--

1548
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:21,918
"Void where prohibited"?

1549
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,555
Well, it was prohibited to send
it to Pennsylvania and Iowa.

1550
01:06:26,557 --> 01:06:29,324
A man like yourself that is
an established actor,

1551
01:06:29,326 --> 01:06:31,059
comedian--
You're not a criminal.

1552
01:06:31,061 --> 01:06:33,261
Why do you think
they targeted you?

1553
01:06:33,263 --> 01:06:37,398
Well, because our movies were
number-one rentals in America.

1554
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,301
What our movies did was
really show the hypocrisy

1555
01:06:41,303 --> 01:06:42,702
of the pot laws.

1556
01:06:42,704 --> 01:06:45,638
In fact, when I went to jail,
they added in the transcript

1557
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:50,376
that our movies have influenced
children for 30 years

1558
01:06:50,378 --> 01:06:53,178
and will continue
to do so forever.

1559
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:56,080
Therefore, I should go to jail.

1560
01:06:56,082 --> 01:06:59,349
You gotta remember,
they were going into Iraq,

1561
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:02,685
and they needed some diversion
as far as headlines go,

1562
01:07:02,687 --> 01:07:05,354
and they equated the
billion-dollar paraphernalia

1563
01:07:05,356 --> 01:07:08,256
business with aiding terrorists.

1564
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:12,059
This was a legitimate company,
paying taxes.

1565
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,561
I was just the face on the bong.

1566
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:16,229
They charged<i> me.</i>

1567
01:07:16,231 --> 01:07:18,197
I had nothing to do
with the company.

1568
01:07:18,199 --> 01:07:20,199
I never shipped
anything to anybody.

1569
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:22,634
It wasn't even his company,
he just loaned his name to it.

1570
01:07:22,636 --> 01:07:26,471
51 people were arrested under
Operation Pipe Dreams.

1571
01:07:26,473 --> 01:07:29,207
Only one person--
Tommy Chong-- went to jail.

1572
01:07:29,209 --> 01:07:32,743
But if I didn't plead, they
threatened my son and my wife.

1573
01:07:32,745 --> 01:07:35,679
Tommy stands up and volunteers
to go to jail.

1574
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:38,048
Says, "Yeah, okay,
that's my paraphernalia.

1575
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,316
Leave my wife and kid alone,"
he's protecting his family.

1576
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:43,052
What kind of force was used in
the day you were arrested?

1577
01:07:43,054 --> 01:07:46,588
There was over
20 SWAT-team people.

1578
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:51,292
Visors, automatic weapons,
helicopters overhead.

1579
01:07:51,294 --> 01:07:55,329
They had news trucks,
Fox News trucks, outside.

1580
01:07:55,331 --> 01:07:57,197
They had the media on the ready.

1581
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,632
This was
a photo-op for everybody.

1582
01:07:59,634 --> 01:08:03,335
They asked, you know,
do I have any drugs?

1583
01:08:03,337 --> 01:08:05,570
I said, "Yeah, I got pot,"
you know.

1584
01:08:05,572 --> 01:08:07,672
And they wanted to know
where it was, so I told them.

1585
01:08:07,674 --> 01:08:09,607
They said, "Well, it's not
really a drug bust."

1586
01:08:09,609 --> 01:08:12,276
I said, "Well, then what the--
Are you doing in my house?"

1587
01:08:12,278 --> 01:08:14,745
Then they said,
"It's about bongs.

1588
01:08:14,747 --> 01:08:18,181
We're bringing down all the bong
companies in America."

1589
01:08:18,183 --> 01:08:21,050
And with Tommy safely
behind bars for nine months,

1590
01:08:21,052 --> 01:08:25,220
the United States drug war
reset its sights,

1591
01:08:25,222 --> 01:08:27,722
this time across borders.

1592
01:08:27,724 --> 01:08:31,392
In downtown Vancouver, just
outside the U.S. consulate,

1593
01:08:31,394 --> 01:08:34,128
a bunch of people had gotten
together and were having a rally

1594
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:37,331
for this guy named Marc Emery.

1595
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:40,734
He had evidently
been selling seeds--

1596
01:08:40,736 --> 01:08:44,704
Marijuana seeds--
To the wrong people.

1597
01:08:44,706 --> 01:08:47,039
Let me tell you,
the DEA wants me

1598
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:49,441
because I am very good
at what I do.

1599
01:08:49,443 --> 01:08:51,509
Well, obviously I'm the most
dangerous man alive.

1600
01:08:51,511 --> 01:08:53,077
Like, really.

1601
01:08:53,079 --> 01:08:55,479
No wonder I'm facing life
imprisonment without parole

1602
01:08:55,481 --> 01:08:57,747
for something that no one's ever
gone to jail for here in Canada.

1603
01:08:57,749 --> 01:09:00,149
No one's ever gone to jail for
seeds, not even for a day.

1604
01:09:00,151 --> 01:09:02,451
Marc and two of his employees
are facing life in prison

1605
01:09:02,453 --> 01:09:05,554
in the United States--
Not Canada, the United States--

1606
01:09:05,556 --> 01:09:07,722
For selling marijuana seeds
over the Internet.

1607
01:09:07,724 --> 01:09:09,623
Vancouver Police came in here

1608
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:13,126
with a warrant
for an extradition,

1609
01:09:13,128 --> 01:09:17,363
but we were taken then to North
Fraser Correctional Center,

1610
01:09:17,365 --> 01:09:21,567
Correctional Center
of the Year 2002.

1611
01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:24,102
Beautiful facility.

1612
01:09:24,104 --> 01:09:27,839
Marc Emery has gotten in
the face of the United States.

1613
01:09:27,841 --> 01:09:31,209
The U.S. sees Marc Emery as
a major political threat

1614
01:09:31,211 --> 01:09:34,745
to its anti-cannabis agenda.

1615
01:09:34,747 --> 01:09:37,614
In a press release from
Karen Tandy, head of the DEA,

1616
01:09:37,616 --> 01:09:39,415
she said that this is not only

1617
01:09:39,417 --> 01:09:41,316
the end of marijuana
trafficking,

1618
01:09:41,318 --> 01:09:43,584
but it's a blow to the
marijuana-legalization movement.

1619
01:09:43,586 --> 01:09:46,520
I gave just under $4 million
away over 11 years

1620
01:09:46,522 --> 01:09:48,421
to Supreme Court challenges,

1621
01:09:48,423 --> 01:09:50,189
ballot initiatives,
political parties,

1622
01:09:50,191 --> 01:09:51,823
you know,
drug-addiction clinics.

1623
01:09:51,825 --> 01:09:53,324
Well, if you're the DEA,

1624
01:09:53,326 --> 01:09:54,858
who the hell do you think
you're gonna go after,

1625
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,260
first and foremost, and as
viciously as you can do it?

1626
01:09:57,262 --> 01:09:59,195
I think they even
admitted it themselves

1627
01:09:59,197 --> 01:10:01,630
on the day of the raid.

1628
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:04,199
The DEA announced, you know...

1629
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:06,367
"He's a legalizer.

1630
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:08,635
"We're shutting down one of
the biggest legalizers.

1631
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:10,703
"The legalization movement

1632
01:10:10,705 --> 01:10:12,671
"won't have a pot of money
to draw from.

1633
01:10:12,673 --> 01:10:15,224
Ha ha ha ha."

1634
01:10:15,225 --> 01:10:17,776
Marc Emery has never gone
to America and sold a seed.

1635
01:10:17,778 --> 01:10:20,880
He does it all from here
by mail order,

1636
01:10:20,882 --> 01:10:25,484
and it's akin to
Canadians ordering, you know,

1637
01:10:25,486 --> 01:10:28,386
a machine gun from
somewhere in America.

1638
01:10:28,388 --> 01:10:30,221
It's against the law,

1639
01:10:30,223 --> 01:10:32,256
and if we receive it here
in Canada,

1640
01:10:32,258 --> 01:10:34,758
they come and arrest us for
receiving the machine gun.

1641
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,527
They don't go to America
and say to Colt,

1642
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:39,562
"Hi, we're arresting you

1643
01:10:39,564 --> 01:10:42,398
'cause you sent a machine gun
to someone in Canada."

1644
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,433
No one's been sentenced
to any time in jail

1645
01:10:44,435 --> 01:10:46,835
in the history of Canada,
in 35 years we've had this law.

1646
01:10:46,837 --> 01:10:50,271
Two people, me and Ian Hunter
in Victoria, were fined.

1647
01:10:50,273 --> 01:10:52,406
There's all sorts of
seed businesses still open.

1648
01:10:52,408 --> 01:10:53,907
Marc's the only one out of about

1649
01:10:53,909 --> 01:10:56,442
50 retail cannabis-seed
businesses in Canada

1650
01:10:56,444 --> 01:10:57,810
that's been charged.

1651
01:10:57,812 --> 01:11:00,679
Marc has been paying the
Canadian federal government

1652
01:11:00,681 --> 01:11:05,550
taxes on income he has made
from selling seeds.

1653
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:07,952
The government relied
on the existence of these

1654
01:11:07,954 --> 01:11:11,288
Internet seed sellers so
that patients who had

1655
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:13,790
qualified for medical-
marijuana exemptions,

1656
01:11:13,792 --> 01:11:16,359
who were bugging them for seed,

1657
01:11:16,361 --> 01:11:18,928
were being directed
to these Internet seeds,

1658
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:20,596
and Marc Emery specifically,

1659
01:11:20,598 --> 01:11:22,898
in some cases, as the place
to get their seed.

1660
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,532
It puts Canada
and our government

1661
01:11:24,534 --> 01:11:26,200
in a very difficult position,

1662
01:11:26,201 --> 01:11:27,867
because they've either got
to hand over a Canadian citizen

1663
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:29,870
to a foreign government
for activities

1664
01:11:29,872 --> 01:11:31,738
that were
entirely done in Canada,

1665
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,506
for which our own government
and our own police

1666
01:11:33,508 --> 01:11:34,940
are not willing to charge him.

1667
01:11:34,942 --> 01:11:37,409
If the Canadian authorities
who rubber-stamped this shit

1668
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:40,578
think that what I've done is
so bad, then charge me.

1669
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:44,648
I should be tried
by a jury of my peers.

1670
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:47,884
I'm not about to be tried
by my peers at all.

1671
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:51,020
I'm about to be
tried by foreigners.

1672
01:11:51,022 --> 01:11:54,857
At 4:20, a time synonymous
with smoking marijuana,

1673
01:11:54,859 --> 01:11:58,026
everyone lit up,

1674
01:11:58,028 --> 01:12:00,762
and for those who didn't have
marijuana to light up...

1675
01:12:04,701 --> 01:12:06,500
Again, the police were close by,

1676
01:12:06,502 --> 01:12:08,568
and again,
they didn't seem to care.

1677
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:10,736
One officer mentioned
she was bothered

1678
01:12:10,738 --> 01:12:12,971
by the smell of the smoke.

1679
01:12:12,973 --> 01:12:15,606
It was kind of confusing.

1680
01:12:15,608 --> 01:12:17,941
How could we be sending
Marc Emery to prison for life

1681
01:12:17,943 --> 01:12:19,842
in the United States

1682
01:12:19,844 --> 01:12:21,777
if even our own police aren't
finding it worth their while

1683
01:12:21,779 --> 01:12:24,846
to bust people smoking it right
in front of them?

1684
01:12:24,848 --> 01:12:27,481
That's not the
only thing that's confusing.

1685
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,486
The marijuana that's consumed
in the United States,

1686
01:12:33,488 --> 01:12:34,820
how much comes from Canada?

1687
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:36,822
I don't know much about Canada.
I don't, either.

1688
01:12:36,824 --> 01:12:38,523
Maybe 20%?

1689
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:39,991
- I'll go with 35.
- 35%?

1690
01:12:39,993 --> 01:12:41,459
And a quarter.

1691
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:42,726
50%. 50?

1692
01:12:42,728 --> 01:12:43,960
50%.

1693
01:12:43,962 --> 01:12:45,561
I would say about 60%. 60%.

1694
01:12:45,563 --> 01:12:47,095
70%.

1695
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:48,629
Yeah, 70, 80%.

1696
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:49,963
At least 80% of it.

1697
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:51,364
Whoo.

1698
01:12:51,366 --> 01:12:52,932
I don't think
it's all that much.

1699
01:12:52,934 --> 01:12:54,733
Most of it is here.

1700
01:12:59,673 --> 01:13:01,506
We're getting the drugs
and are saying,

1701
01:13:01,508 --> 01:13:03,441
"Oh," you know, "BC bud."

1702
01:13:03,443 --> 01:13:06,076
This was when some of
the people in Canada

1703
01:13:06,078 --> 01:13:08,678
were trying to
get marijuana legalized...

1704
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,547
John Walters went up there and
said, "What you're talking about

1705
01:13:11,549 --> 01:13:14,449
"is passing a law
that will allow you

1706
01:13:14,451 --> 01:13:16,918
to export poison to my country."

1707
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,488
When we talk about "poison,"
exporting poison,

1708
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:22,823
what do we export to Canada?

1709
01:13:22,825 --> 01:13:24,391
Cigarettes.

1710
01:13:24,393 --> 01:13:27,761
430,000 people die in
the United States every year

1711
01:13:27,763 --> 01:13:29,729
from ingesting cigarettes.

1712
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:31,630
Five million around the world.

1713
01:13:31,632 --> 01:13:33,932
So who's exporting
the poison here?

1714
01:13:33,934 --> 01:13:36,034
Of the six million people who
could benefit from treatment

1715
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:37,902
that need it in
the United States today,

1716
01:13:37,904 --> 01:13:39,937
60% are dependent on marijuana.

1717
01:13:39,939 --> 01:13:42,906
Lies, lies, lies.

1718
01:13:42,908 --> 01:13:45,375
You know, they invited<i> me,</i>
I'm sorry.

1719
01:13:45,377 --> 01:13:48,444
I wasn't sure who invited him
and why he came here yet again.

1720
01:13:48,446 --> 01:13:49,912
He's been here before.

1721
01:13:49,914 --> 01:13:51,680
He needs to shake his head.

1722
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:53,415
So how about him
shutting down the cocaine

1723
01:13:53,417 --> 01:13:54,816
that's coming across the border?

1724
01:13:54,818 --> 01:13:56,684
How about him
shutting down the guns?

1725
01:13:56,686 --> 01:13:58,652
Sometimes you feel like
you've stepped into.

1726
01:13:58,654 --> 01:14:00,086
"Alice in Wonderland,"

1727
01:14:00,088 --> 01:14:02,455
you've gone through
the looking glass.

1728
01:14:02,457 --> 01:14:04,924
In fact, more Colombians die
from U.S. tobacco

1729
01:14:04,926 --> 01:14:08,027
than Americans die from
Colombian coca products.

1730
01:14:08,029 --> 01:14:09,928
So what's the drug war
really about?

1731
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:11,829
Because if you
don't want American tobacco

1732
01:14:11,831 --> 01:14:13,681
in your country,

1733
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:15,532
America will go to war, in a
trade sense, with your country.

1734
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,468
You have Canada engage in
cannabis-policy reform

1735
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:20,770
and taxing
and regulating cannabis,

1736
01:14:20,772 --> 01:14:23,806
and all the scare stories
haven't come true,

1737
01:14:23,808 --> 01:14:25,674
you have an awfully hard time

1738
01:14:25,676 --> 01:14:27,575
sustaining your own
domestic policies.

1739
01:14:27,577 --> 01:14:30,444
What do you think would happen
between Canada and the U.S.

1740
01:14:30,446 --> 01:14:32,412
if Canada were
to legalize marijuana?

1741
01:14:32,414 --> 01:14:34,013
There's been rumors
that they're like,

1742
01:14:34,015 --> 01:14:36,448
"We'll shut down the border."

1743
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:38,116
I don't think so.

1744
01:14:41,154 --> 01:14:43,087
I've heard that, too,
but then my question is,

1745
01:14:43,089 --> 01:14:46,924
do you want LA, you know,
in the dark and thirsty?

1746
01:14:46,926 --> 01:14:49,159
If you do that, then
we're not gonna ship oil,

1747
01:14:49,161 --> 01:14:51,094
we're not gonna ship water,

1748
01:14:51,096 --> 01:14:53,096
we're not gonna
ship electricity.

1749
01:14:53,098 --> 01:14:54,530
It's not gonna happen.

1750
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,315
We're too important
to each other.

1751
01:14:56,316 --> 01:14:58,099
The softwood-lumber people
gonna stop doing business?

1752
01:14:58,102 --> 01:15:00,135
The fishing guys gonna
stop doing business?

1753
01:15:00,137 --> 01:15:02,203
Are the people who manufacture
stuff back and forth

1754
01:15:02,205 --> 01:15:04,171
across the border
gonna stop doing business

1755
01:15:04,173 --> 01:15:05,939
'cause pot's legal here?

1756
01:15:05,941 --> 01:15:08,207
Business interests
aren't gonna sit still

1757
01:15:08,209 --> 01:15:10,876
for losing millions of
dollars a day

1758
01:15:10,878 --> 01:15:13,211
because of border-wait times
simply because Canada takes

1759
01:15:13,213 --> 01:15:16,013
a different domestic social
policy on cannabis.

1760
01:15:16,015 --> 01:15:18,882
Yes, business interests.

1761
01:15:18,884 --> 01:15:21,718
Sometimes they just
seem to pop up,

1762
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,887
and every so often,
in the most unlikely of places.

1763
01:15:28,492 --> 01:15:31,960
We have seen an explosion in
prison construction

1764
01:15:31,962 --> 01:15:36,164
that lags only slightly behind
the explosion in incarceration.

1765
01:15:36,166 --> 01:15:39,066
There are more people in jail in
America now than ever before.

1766
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:40,700
In the United States,

1767
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:42,568
it's one of the
fastest-growing industries.

1768
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:44,703
Some major investment companies
at one time

1769
01:15:44,705 --> 01:15:46,071
described private prisons

1770
01:15:46,073 --> 01:15:47,806
as one of the best investments
you could make.

1771
01:15:47,808 --> 01:15:49,841
So you could make
more money building prisons

1772
01:15:49,843 --> 01:15:51,776
than any other type of
investment.

1773
01:15:51,778 --> 01:15:54,245
They're extraordinarily
expensive to build.

1774
01:15:54,247 --> 01:15:58,215
They're even far more expensive
to operate and maintain.

1775
01:15:58,217 --> 01:16:00,483
Right now in
the United States of America,

1776
01:16:00,485 --> 01:16:03,619
the biggest growth industry is
the privatized prison complex.

1777
01:16:03,621 --> 01:16:06,555
Japan, for instance,
incarcerates at 38 people

1778
01:16:06,557 --> 01:16:08,223
per 100,000 population.

1779
01:16:08,225 --> 01:16:12,694
The United States incarcerates
at a rate of 726 people

1780
01:16:12,696 --> 01:16:14,762
per 100,000 population.

1781
01:16:14,764 --> 01:16:16,563
In a 20-year period,

1782
01:16:16,565 --> 01:16:19,699
the prison population in
the United States quadrupled.

1783
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:23,169
We have just shy of 5% of
the world's population

1784
01:16:23,171 --> 01:16:25,871
and almost 25% of its prisoners.

1785
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:28,173
Even South Africa at its worst

1786
01:16:28,175 --> 01:16:31,643
didn't have as many prisoners
per capita as America has now.

1787
01:16:31,645 --> 01:16:36,180
Texas just built 77 prisons
in about the last 20 years.

1788
01:16:36,182 --> 01:16:40,517
We find state treasuries on
the verge of bankruptcy

1789
01:16:40,519 --> 01:16:42,479
as a result of
prison construction.

1790
01:17:02,773 --> 01:17:05,540
Some think there won't be room
for them in jail.

1791
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:07,074
We'll make room.

1792
01:17:07,076 --> 01:17:09,976
We're almost
doubling prison space.

1793
01:17:09,978 --> 01:17:12,878
Some think there aren't
enough prosecutors.

1794
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,646
We'll hire them,

1795
01:17:14,648 --> 01:17:18,549
with the largest increase in
federal prosecutors in history.

1796
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:20,050
In the late '80s,

1797
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,985
there were about five
privately run prisons

1798
01:17:21,987 --> 01:17:24,020
in the United States.

1799
01:17:24,022 --> 01:17:28,557
By 2005, that number
had reached over 260.

1800
01:17:28,559 --> 01:17:30,959
As soon as you've accumulated
a certain amount of capital

1801
01:17:30,961 --> 01:17:32,560
from building prisons,

1802
01:17:32,562 --> 01:17:34,962
you can start investing that in
ensuring job security,

1803
01:17:34,964 --> 01:17:37,097
ensuring there'll always
be more prisoners around

1804
01:17:37,099 --> 01:17:39,632
to require more prisons.

1805
01:17:39,634 --> 01:17:41,600
We have private prisons?

1806
01:17:41,602 --> 01:17:43,868
What the fuck is that?
How did that happen?

1807
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:46,937
How can you profit over people
going to jail?

1808
01:17:46,939 --> 01:17:50,740
That's scary,
that's a bad, bad sign.

1809
01:17:50,742 --> 01:17:53,676
Our society is in deep,
deep, deep trouble

1810
01:17:53,678 --> 01:17:55,344
if nobody's looking into that.

1811
01:17:55,346 --> 01:17:58,213
Correctional-guard unions have
become powerful lobbying groups,

1812
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:02,150
pushing for longer sentences
on less-serious crimes.

1813
01:18:02,152 --> 01:18:05,720
California's has become one of
the most powerful in the state.

1814
01:18:05,722 --> 01:18:08,055
The California Department of
Corrections budget

1815
01:18:08,057 --> 01:18:11,625
rose from 923 million in 1985

1816
01:18:11,627 --> 01:18:15,662
to 5.7 billion in 2004.

1817
01:18:15,664 --> 01:18:20,233
Between 1977 and 1999,
overall local and state spending

1818
01:18:20,235 --> 01:18:24,103
on corrections across
the country grew 946%,

1819
01:18:24,105 --> 01:18:26,238
almost 2 1/2 times
the rate in which

1820
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,974
spending on education increased.

1821
01:18:28,976 --> 01:18:32,177
And prisons aren't the only
thing money's being spent on.

1822
01:18:32,179 --> 01:18:34,345
There are millions
of drug tests per year.

1823
01:18:34,347 --> 01:18:36,313
There's money to be
made on that, it's huge.

1824
01:18:36,315 --> 01:18:39,115
It started off with
people saying,

1825
01:18:39,117 --> 01:18:42,618
"We really need to test people
in dangerous occupations."

1826
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:44,753
Things like police officers
should be tested,

1827
01:18:44,755 --> 01:18:46,387
pilots in airplanes.

1828
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:48,756
Then somebody said,
"Well, our athletes,

1829
01:18:48,758 --> 01:18:50,824
we should probably test them
for drugs, too."

1830
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:52,725
Then somebody
came along and said,

1831
01:18:52,727 --> 01:18:56,028
"Well, it's not just the
professional athletes.

1832
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:58,930
"How about the athletes
in colleges and high schools?

1833
01:18:58,932 --> 01:19:01,132
They need to be tested, too."

1834
01:19:01,134 --> 01:19:03,001
And then they thought a little
harder and they said,

1835
01:19:03,003 --> 01:19:05,837
"Well, suppose
we just test everybody

1836
01:19:05,839 --> 01:19:08,306
"that goes out for an
extracurricular activity.

1837
01:19:08,308 --> 01:19:10,041
"That should be constitutional

1838
01:19:10,043 --> 01:19:12,043
because they don't
have to do that."

1839
01:19:12,045 --> 01:19:14,845
So now if you want to join
the chess club at school

1840
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:16,880
or the French club,

1841
01:19:16,882 --> 01:19:19,415
you gotta pee in a bottle.

1842
01:19:19,417 --> 01:19:23,519
Now they're pushing to make laws
to test all children at school.

1843
01:19:23,521 --> 01:19:26,522
All the studies show this
doesn't have anything to do

1844
01:19:26,524 --> 01:19:28,924
with whether kids use
drugs or not,

1845
01:19:28,926 --> 01:19:31,760
so it looks to me
like this has a lot more to do

1846
01:19:31,762 --> 01:19:35,063
with the money that's being made
for drug testing.

1847
01:19:35,065 --> 01:19:38,199
Can you imagine how
much money will be involved

1848
01:19:38,201 --> 01:19:42,102
if we can randomly test every
child in a school?

1849
01:19:42,104 --> 01:19:44,804
A lot of these places
that have been urine-testing

1850
01:19:44,806 --> 01:19:47,106
have refused to continue
to do it,

1851
01:19:47,108 --> 01:19:49,308
because the only thing
that these urine tests

1852
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:51,410
are finding is marijuana.

1853
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:54,513
The other drugs that people take
dissipate from their systems

1854
01:19:54,515 --> 01:19:56,948
fast enough to not be found.

1855
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:59,417
If they smoke
a marijuana cigarette,

1856
01:19:59,419 --> 01:20:02,186
28 days later, if they
pee in a bottle,

1857
01:20:02,188 --> 01:20:04,788
they're gonna show
that they've had a drug.

1858
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:06,556
But if they use a hard drug--

1859
01:20:06,558 --> 01:20:09,492
Heroin, cocaine,
methamphetamine--

1860
01:20:09,494 --> 01:20:11,794
In a long weekend,
nobody can tell that they've

1861
01:20:11,796 --> 01:20:13,228
used that drug.

1862
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:15,063
So what does that say
to our young people?

1863
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:16,798
It says if you
don't wanna get caught,

1864
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,866
don't use the soft drugs--
Use the hard drugs.

1865
01:20:18,868 --> 01:20:21,501
It's not just urine anymore,
it's hair and saliva.

1866
01:20:21,503 --> 01:20:23,836
They'll do blood testing.

1867
01:20:23,838 --> 01:20:25,437
There's industry there,
this is money.

1868
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:27,539
They're not doing
in it for free.

1869
01:20:36,816 --> 01:20:39,449
The most profitable industry
in the United States

1870
01:20:39,451 --> 01:20:41,117
is pharmaceuticals.

1871
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:44,987
Dollars involved
is just... staggering.

1872
01:20:44,989 --> 01:20:47,055
Can it really be?

1873
01:20:47,057 --> 01:20:50,058
Has medicine really
become that profitable?

1874
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:51,592
The fact is it has.

1875
01:20:51,594 --> 01:20:54,328
In 2005,
U.S. prescription-drug sales

1876
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:58,532
rose 5.4% to $251 billion,

1877
01:20:58,534 --> 01:21:01,067
and global pharmaceutical sales

1878
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:04,970
rose 7% to $602 billion.

1879
01:21:04,972 --> 01:21:07,973
Now, why would pharmaceuticals
be threatened by a plant?

1880
01:21:07,975 --> 01:21:12,143
The answer may be as
simple as one word, "natural,"

1881
01:21:12,145 --> 01:21:14,945
because a significant amount
of research to date

1882
01:21:14,947 --> 01:21:18,148
has confirmed or suggested that
marijuana in its natural state

1883
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:20,316
is still
the most effective form.

1884
01:21:20,318 --> 01:21:22,318
Can you imagine a world
where you or I wouldn't

1885
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,353
have to pay
for certain medicines?

1886
01:21:24,355 --> 01:21:29,024
After dealing with about 10,000
patients over the last 15 years,

1887
01:21:29,026 --> 01:21:33,094
I would say that over 200
different medical conditions

1888
01:21:33,096 --> 01:21:35,930
respond favorably to cannabis.

1889
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:39,300
It appears to have benefits that
we never, ever knew about.

1890
01:21:39,302 --> 01:21:40,434
Glaucoma.

1891
01:21:40,436 --> 01:21:42,335
Epilepsy, muscular dystrophy.

1892
01:21:42,337 --> 01:21:43,502
Arthritis.

1893
01:21:43,504 --> 01:21:44,936
Multiple sclerosis.

1894
01:21:44,938 --> 01:21:46,137
Wasting syndrome.

1895
01:21:46,139 --> 01:21:47,404
Nausea, chronic pain.

1896
01:21:47,406 --> 01:21:49,472
Depression, anxiety,
hepatitis "C," cancer.

1897
01:21:49,474 --> 01:21:51,040
Chemo. AIDS patients.

1898
01:21:51,042 --> 01:21:52,908
Is there a product
out there today

1899
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:55,877
that provides as many medical
benefits as cannabis?

1900
01:21:59,549 --> 01:22:01,582
No.

1901
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:06,520
It remains an un-utilized
major resource.

1902
01:22:06,522 --> 01:22:10,624
The way to riches in
the pharmaceutical industry

1903
01:22:10,626 --> 01:22:15,195
is to have a drug which
can be patented.

1904
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:18,298
Cannabis is problematic
right from the start

1905
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,900
because it's
a multi-molecule drug.

1906
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:24,003
In 1930, it wasn't possible
to patent plants,

1907
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:27,306
and that's the reason that
Pharma never picked up on this,

1908
01:22:27,308 --> 01:22:30,075
because by synthesizing
and owning compounds,

1909
01:22:30,077 --> 01:22:31,643
that's where the profit motive

1910
01:22:31,645 --> 01:22:33,678
comes into
the pharmaceutical industry.

1911
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,547
The patent in the United States
lasts for 20 years.

1912
01:22:36,549 --> 01:22:39,049
You can charge
whatever you want at that time,

1913
01:22:39,051 --> 01:22:40,984
and that's where you
make the killing.

1914
01:22:40,986 --> 01:22:42,952
There's no money to be
made off natural plants.

1915
01:22:42,954 --> 01:22:45,054
If you can use
a natural medicine

1916
01:22:45,056 --> 01:22:48,023
that you can grow in your own
home which costs pennies to use,

1917
01:22:48,025 --> 01:22:50,025
you're gonna do that.

1918
01:22:50,027 --> 01:22:51,526
You need water and dirt.

1919
01:22:51,528 --> 01:22:53,928
Not only that, you have
that plant forever.

1920
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:57,564
Prime motivation behind any drug
company is to make money,

1921
01:22:57,566 --> 01:22:59,599
and as much money as possible.

1922
01:22:59,601 --> 01:23:02,468
They're corporations, and
corporations, everybody knows,

1923
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:05,204
it's like that diffusion of
responsibility thing.

1924
01:23:05,206 --> 01:23:07,339
There's so many people
working for corporations

1925
01:23:07,341 --> 01:23:09,341
that they lose their humanity.

1926
01:23:09,343 --> 01:23:11,643
So those potential customers for
these pharmaceutical companies

1927
01:23:11,645 --> 01:23:14,946
that are not there if they're
using a natural plant.

1928
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:16,580
It's unlimited.

1929
01:23:16,582 --> 01:23:18,348
Grow more, you get more
medicine.

1930
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:20,316
Pharmaceutical
companies don't want you

1931
01:23:20,318 --> 01:23:21,984
growing your own medicine.

1932
01:23:21,986 --> 01:23:25,020
The government supported
a small drug company

1933
01:23:25,022 --> 01:23:27,022
by the name of Unimed

1934
01:23:27,024 --> 01:23:31,192
to take a synthetic THC,
tetrahydrocannabinol,

1935
01:23:31,194 --> 01:23:34,128
and to put it into capsules

1936
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:37,397
to be used as a oral medicine.

1937
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:39,132
This became Marinol.

1938
01:23:39,134 --> 01:23:43,969
This THC in Marinol is exactly
the same 21-carbon molecule

1939
01:23:43,971 --> 01:23:46,671
that's in herbal marijuana.

1940
01:23:46,673 --> 01:23:49,206
But it's not the same
as medical marijuana.

1941
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:51,074
It's not a crude mixture
of things,

1942
01:23:51,076 --> 01:23:53,209
and there's no guarantee
that you get the same results.

1943
01:23:53,211 --> 01:23:57,079
You can make a synthetic
delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol

1944
01:23:57,081 --> 01:23:58,580
in a test tube.

1945
01:23:58,582 --> 01:24:00,481
It'll have exactly the same
number of atoms

1946
01:24:00,483 --> 01:24:02,216
in the same arrangement,

1947
01:24:02,218 --> 01:24:06,220
but how in the test tube can you
put the electron spins together,

1948
01:24:06,222 --> 01:24:10,724
the subatomic quirks and quarks,
if you like, of that compound,

1949
01:24:10,726 --> 01:24:14,060
in the same way that
a biological-enzyme system

1950
01:24:14,062 --> 01:24:16,662
will put it together--
It can't happen.

1951
01:24:16,664 --> 01:24:18,463
In the case of
a synthetic compound,

1952
01:24:18,465 --> 01:24:21,165
if it's only an ingredient
from the cannabis,

1953
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:23,400
they can formulate
that as a drug

1954
01:24:23,402 --> 01:24:25,468
and make a lot more money
out of it.

1955
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:27,369
We're confused
that if, you know,

1956
01:24:27,371 --> 01:24:29,371
you keep hearing that there's
no scientific proof

1957
01:24:29,373 --> 01:24:31,306
to medicinal benefits
of marijuana,

1958
01:24:31,308 --> 01:24:33,474
why are there drugs
like Marinol on the market?

1959
01:24:33,476 --> 01:24:35,275
Why do they even exist?

1960
01:24:35,277 --> 01:24:37,577
Well, that's part of this
double-talk about it.

1961
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:40,446
If we take
and change it a little bit

1962
01:24:40,448 --> 01:24:43,215
so you<i> believe</i>
it isn't marijuana,

1963
01:24:43,217 --> 01:24:46,384
then it's okay, it's
a great medicine.

1964
01:24:46,386 --> 01:24:48,786
You know, they're trying
to make marijuana into medicine

1965
01:24:48,788 --> 01:24:50,621
because it<i> is</i> medicine!

1966
01:24:50,623 --> 01:24:53,056
Why did the government
actually grow marijuana?

1967
01:24:53,058 --> 01:24:54,791
I mean, the government has had
marijuana programs

1968
01:24:54,793 --> 01:24:57,226
that existed since the '70s.

1969
01:24:57,228 --> 01:24:59,595
It's impossible
for me to believe

1970
01:24:59,597 --> 01:25:02,631
that the government even
believes their own propaganda.

1971
01:25:02,633 --> 01:25:04,466
What I do believe is this,

1972
01:25:04,468 --> 01:25:06,534
that you can fool some of
the people some of the time,

1973
01:25:06,536 --> 01:25:08,536
and they're doing an excellent
job of that.

1974
01:25:08,538 --> 01:25:10,404
And for all
the claims of these drugs

1975
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:12,572
being a more viable medicine
because there's no high,

1976
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:14,507
we checked some
of the side effects.

1977
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:16,342
For Marinol-- dizziness,

1978
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:19,211
feelings of exaggerated
happiness, drowsiness.

1979
01:25:19,213 --> 01:25:22,781
Last time I checked, those were
signs of getting high.

1980
01:25:22,783 --> 01:25:25,717
If it is indeed
side effects of marijuana

1981
01:25:25,719 --> 01:25:27,585
that are preventing the
pharmaceutical world

1982
01:25:27,587 --> 01:25:30,120
from accepting
marijuana as a viable medicine,

1983
01:25:30,122 --> 01:25:32,055
then they better start paying
more attention

1984
01:25:32,057 --> 01:25:34,557
to the products they've
been marketing for years.

1985
01:25:34,559 --> 01:25:37,092
Every year,
prescription medicines kill

1986
01:25:37,094 --> 01:25:39,560
over 100,000 people.

1987
01:25:42,665 --> 01:25:45,365
The pharmaceutical industry
has been excellent

1988
01:25:45,367 --> 01:25:49,836
at convincing the public
that they need their potions.

1989
01:25:49,838 --> 01:25:53,239
If you watch any kind of
commercial for drugs,

1990
01:25:53,241 --> 01:25:55,574
they're always
using the third person.

1991
01:25:55,576 --> 01:25:58,143
For example, "Where does
a headache come from?

1992
01:25:58,145 --> 01:26:00,712
It comes from
out there somewhere."

1993
01:26:00,714 --> 01:26:04,749
Don't sell the steak,
sell the sizzle.

1994
01:26:04,751 --> 01:26:06,484
How many people
in this country alone

1995
01:26:06,486 --> 01:26:08,385
are addicted to antidepressants?

1996
01:26:08,387 --> 01:26:10,186
How many people who are on
antidepressants

1997
01:26:10,188 --> 01:26:12,154
really have imbalances,
and how many of them

1998
01:26:12,156 --> 01:26:14,623
just got off a bad relationship
and they're depressed?

1999
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:17,292
It seems to be acceptable
to give people something

2000
01:26:17,294 --> 01:26:19,494
as long as you're wearing
a white smock

2001
01:26:19,496 --> 01:26:22,430
or you're giving
them a legal prescription.

2002
01:26:22,432 --> 01:26:24,765
It doesn't matter how deadly
the particular drug might be

2003
01:26:24,767 --> 01:26:27,034
in terms of side effects.

2004
01:26:27,035 --> 01:26:29,302
What we call modern medicine
is actually alternative medicine

2005
01:26:29,304 --> 01:26:31,337
because it's highly
experimental.

2006
01:26:31,339 --> 01:26:33,639
It's often
dangerous, often toxic,

2007
01:26:33,641 --> 01:26:36,475
and it kills a lot of people.

2008
01:26:36,477 --> 01:26:38,110
To me, it's crazy.

2009
01:26:38,111 --> 01:26:39,744
There's a lot of stuff
out there that will affect you

2010
01:26:39,746 --> 01:26:41,312
in different ways.

2011
01:26:41,314 --> 01:26:44,248
Look at aspirin, heroin,
both invented by Bayer.

2012
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:46,683
I thought heroin came
from opium seeds and was--

2013
01:26:46,685 --> 01:26:48,751
Just natural, effective opium?

2014
01:26:48,753 --> 01:26:50,619
You keep making it more
and more concentrated?

2015
01:26:50,621 --> 01:26:52,454
No, you have to add certain
chemicals to it

2016
01:26:52,456 --> 01:26:54,155
and tweak it a certain way.

2017
01:26:54,157 --> 01:26:55,756
It doesn't just
come from opium itself.

2018
01:26:55,758 --> 01:26:57,691
What was heroin made for?

2019
01:26:57,693 --> 01:27:01,161
As a cure for
morphine addiction and coughs.

2020
01:27:01,163 --> 01:27:04,197
"Heroin, the sedative
for coughs."

2021
01:27:04,199 --> 01:27:05,631
Pseudoephedrine.

2022
01:27:05,633 --> 01:27:07,566
That's the main ingredient
in methamphetamine,

2023
01:27:07,568 --> 01:27:10,302
is to cure the cough, the cold.

2024
01:27:10,304 --> 01:27:12,704
You get a cold, "Oh, I think
I'll do some meth."

2025
01:27:12,706 --> 01:27:16,407
When you look at it from a large
perspective, like, what's weed?

2026
01:27:16,409 --> 01:27:19,443
Even Francis Young,
the DEA's own judge,

2027
01:27:19,445 --> 01:27:22,279
who took medical testimony
for over two weeks,

2028
01:27:22,281 --> 01:27:24,281
made this statement--

2029
01:27:24,283 --> 01:27:27,684
"Marijuana, in its natural form,
is one of the safest

2030
01:27:27,686 --> 01:27:31,921
"therapeutically active
substances known to man.

2031
01:27:31,923 --> 01:27:35,591
"Yet, despite this and the
ever-mounting number

2032
01:27:35,593 --> 01:27:38,360
"of real-world
patient success stories,

2033
01:27:38,362 --> 01:27:41,596
"cannabis remains listed as
a Schedule I narcotic.

2034
01:27:41,598 --> 01:27:43,798
"Under that category,
marijuana is classified

2035
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,467
as having no known
medical value."

2036
01:27:52,608 --> 01:27:56,610
I-I have...

2037
01:27:56,612 --> 01:28:01,180
m-m-multip-ple

2038
01:28:01,182 --> 01:28:03,682
sclerosis.

2039
01:28:03,684 --> 01:28:07,619
When we first met Greg,
his shaking was so severe,

2040
01:28:07,621 --> 01:28:10,254
he informed us that he would
need a few puffs of marijuana

2041
01:28:10,256 --> 01:28:14,191
in order to participate
in the interview.

2042
01:28:14,193 --> 01:28:18,295
The difference
was night and day.

2043
01:28:18,297 --> 01:28:20,196
What do you say to those

2044
01:28:20,198 --> 01:28:22,464
that say marijuana
needs to be tested

2045
01:28:22,466 --> 01:28:24,833
and regulated and have
the high taken out

2046
01:28:24,835 --> 01:28:27,468
for pharmaceutical
companies to consider it

2047
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,870
a valuable medicine?

2048
01:28:29,872 --> 01:28:32,572
Huh.

2049
01:28:32,574 --> 01:28:35,341
That's a pretty,

2050
01:28:35,343 --> 01:28:41,613
and I only mean this
as a measurement...

2051
01:28:41,615 --> 01:28:45,483
as to how much...

2052
01:28:45,485 --> 01:28:48,252
it is actually

2053
01:28:48,254 --> 01:28:53,991
a pathetic... thing to say.

2054
01:28:53,993 --> 01:28:57,561
I mean, just look at me.

2055
01:28:57,563 --> 01:29:01,798
Is it not blatantly obvious

2056
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,435
that I have just enjoyed

2057
01:29:06,437 --> 01:29:11,573
however many tokes...
I look happy.

2058
01:29:11,575 --> 01:29:14,609
Greg has been using
marijuana for years

2059
01:29:14,611 --> 01:29:16,877
and stated to us
that he's never experienced

2060
01:29:16,879 --> 01:29:18,979
any negative effects.

2061
01:29:18,981 --> 01:29:20,413
I'm never--

2062
01:29:21,983 --> 01:29:24,916
"I need, I need my marijuana!"

2063
01:29:27,587 --> 01:29:31,488
That's... stupid.

2064
01:29:31,490 --> 01:29:36,425
It... takes away my discomfort,

2065
01:29:36,427 --> 01:29:39,494
let's call it.

2066
01:29:39,496 --> 01:29:44,465
It does enhance my very being.

2067
01:29:44,467 --> 01:29:47,801
Where do think you'd be if
you didn't get to smoke it,

2068
01:29:47,803 --> 01:29:50,403
like, dealing with your pain?

2069
01:29:50,405 --> 01:29:53,939
Huh.

2070
01:29:53,941 --> 01:29:56,874
I would have found a way.

2071
01:30:00,613 --> 01:30:02,512
How does the training
and education

2072
01:30:02,514 --> 01:30:04,847
of medical doctors today
work against the acceptance

2073
01:30:04,849 --> 01:30:07,883
of prescribing marijuana
as medicine?

2074
01:30:07,885 --> 01:30:10,752
Well, it works against
them because they're brought,

2075
01:30:10,754 --> 01:30:13,588
right from the beginning,
right into the fold

2076
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:15,823
of the pharmaceutical industry.

2077
01:30:15,825 --> 01:30:18,959
Reading journals, reading
these advertisements,

2078
01:30:18,961 --> 01:30:21,828
or they're
reading papers on drugs

2079
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:24,897
that were financed by
the drug companies,

2080
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:28,033
or they're being
seduced by the companies.

2081
01:30:28,035 --> 01:30:31,703
Fancy dinners, a trip
for a weekend.

2082
01:30:31,705 --> 01:30:34,939
"Would you like to
have 18 rounds of golf?"

2083
01:30:34,941 --> 01:30:39,443
And some of them get outright
money from the drug companies.

2084
01:30:39,445 --> 01:30:41,511
I've met doctors
who said when they first

2085
01:30:41,513 --> 01:30:43,679
came out of medical school,
they didn't know what to do.

2086
01:30:43,681 --> 01:30:45,147
It was really overwhelming.

2087
01:30:45,149 --> 01:30:47,115
They had live patients in front
of them who needed help.

2088
01:30:47,117 --> 01:30:49,484
They were very happy
to have representatives

2089
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:52,520
tell them what medicines would
be best for their patients.

2090
01:30:52,522 --> 01:30:56,524
So doctors have a bias

2091
01:30:56,526 --> 01:31:01,495
toward the products of
pharmaceutical industries.

2092
01:31:01,497 --> 01:31:04,531
They do not readily
accept the idea

2093
01:31:04,533 --> 01:31:08,101
that a simple plant
or herb may be useful.

2094
01:31:08,103 --> 01:31:10,203
I don't know if they think
it's hocus-pocus.

2095
01:31:10,205 --> 01:31:11,904
I just think
that they don't feel that

2096
01:31:11,906 --> 01:31:14,106
there's the kind of testing
that they're used to.

2097
01:31:14,108 --> 01:31:15,707
That's the problem we have.

2098
01:31:15,709 --> 01:31:17,575
What I try to impress
upon these people

2099
01:31:17,577 --> 01:31:19,543
is we're trying to
put the science into it,

2100
01:31:19,545 --> 01:31:21,444
and yet some people are
very resistant

2101
01:31:21,446 --> 01:31:23,446
to even attempts to do that.

2102
01:31:23,448 --> 01:31:25,981
All of the funding is coming
directly or indirectly

2103
01:31:25,983 --> 01:31:28,850
from the drug companies,
and these people, obviously,

2104
01:31:28,852 --> 01:31:31,786
for obvious reasons, are
determining the agendas.

2105
01:31:31,788 --> 01:31:34,188
Now, think of
the lobbying potential

2106
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:37,724
behind the most profitable
industry in the United States.

2107
01:31:37,726 --> 01:31:40,860
Think of the power, and do
they get their way?

2108
01:31:44,765 --> 01:31:46,998
Why can't we explore
its medicinal potential?

2109
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,767
Why can't we use it to
make more products?

2110
01:31:49,769 --> 01:31:52,236
To myself and people
involved in this business,

2111
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:54,972
it stopped making sense
a long time ago.

2112
01:31:54,974 --> 01:31:57,975
The common response is really

2113
01:31:57,977 --> 01:32:01,244
that medical marijuana
is a stalking horse

2114
01:32:01,246 --> 01:32:05,615
for legalizing it.

2115
01:32:05,617 --> 01:32:07,716
And so what?

2116
01:32:11,254 --> 01:32:13,254
What do they want?

2117
01:32:13,256 --> 01:32:15,923
We should be making use
of this plant,

2118
01:32:15,925 --> 01:32:18,692
and really,
that's all I can say.

2119
01:32:18,694 --> 01:32:22,062
The restriction,
the Prohibition is all,

2120
01:32:22,064 --> 01:32:26,232
in my mind, just stupidity,
and I don't condone stupidity.

2121
01:32:26,234 --> 01:32:29,101
And that's a problem--
How do politicians,

2122
01:32:29,103 --> 01:32:31,937
after years of promoting claims
of marijuana's harms,

2123
01:32:31,939 --> 01:32:35,106
pushing for larger
drug-war budgets,

2124
01:32:35,108 --> 01:32:37,541
constructing political platforms
based on a stance

2125
01:32:37,543 --> 01:32:39,576
that vilifies marijuana,

2126
01:32:39,578 --> 01:32:41,711
and being lobbied
by Big Business,

2127
01:32:41,713 --> 01:32:45,047
how do these same politicians
now reverse their stance?

2128
01:32:45,049 --> 01:32:47,816
What politician can come before
their constituents today

2129
01:32:47,818 --> 01:32:49,984
and say marijuana
should be decriminalized

2130
01:32:49,986 --> 01:32:52,753
when yesterday they said it was
evil and dangerous?

2131
01:32:52,755 --> 01:32:54,721
Their constituents
are gonna wanna know

2132
01:32:54,723 --> 01:32:56,723
why you changed your mind.

2133
01:32:56,725 --> 01:32:58,925
Were you lying to us,
or were you stupid?

2134
01:32:58,927 --> 01:33:01,661
Either way, you're not getting
elected next time.

2135
01:33:01,663 --> 01:33:03,696
Whoops, we made a mistake.

2136
01:33:03,698 --> 01:33:06,832
You 17 million people should not
have been arrested,

2137
01:33:06,834 --> 01:33:09,167
some of you jailed,
some of you fined,

2138
01:33:09,169 --> 01:33:12,170
some of you lost the handle
on your career.

2139
01:33:12,172 --> 01:33:14,071
One way to bypass this problem,

2140
01:33:14,073 --> 01:33:16,073
in the face of ever-growing
empirical evidence,

2141
01:33:16,075 --> 01:33:17,841
is to divert attention.

2142
01:33:17,843 --> 01:33:20,043
Add a word--
"medicinal."

2143
01:33:20,045 --> 01:33:22,078
Put the word "medicinal"
in front of marijuana,

2144
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,280
and you are now talking about
something completely different

2145
01:33:24,282 --> 01:33:26,248
if you're a politician.

2146
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:28,583
Why is there a perception
that healthy people

2147
01:33:28,585 --> 01:33:30,318
are affected differently

2148
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,721
and unable to fend off
the detrimental consequences,

2149
01:33:33,723 --> 01:33:36,090
whereas a person with a lowered
immune system

2150
01:33:36,092 --> 01:33:37,791
or terminal illness

2151
01:33:37,793 --> 01:33:40,160
seems to experience
none of these effects?

2152
01:33:40,162 --> 01:33:42,595
Some people go home at the end
of the day and they drink

2153
01:33:42,597 --> 01:33:44,897
to kind of wash away the day.

2154
01:33:44,899 --> 01:33:46,665
You know, just like,
"Oh, that was a hard day.

2155
01:33:46,667 --> 01:33:48,800
I need a few drinks,
relax, kick back."

2156
01:33:48,802 --> 01:33:50,334
So is that relieving pain?

2157
01:33:50,336 --> 01:33:52,836
Maybe-- or is it pursuing
pleasure?

2158
01:33:52,838 --> 01:33:54,371
I don't know.

2159
01:33:54,372 --> 01:33:55,905
So if you think about this in
the context of cannabis,

2160
01:33:55,907 --> 01:33:57,640
it also has relevance.

2161
01:33:57,642 --> 01:34:00,609
The government's lot more likely
to forgive cannabis use

2162
01:34:00,611 --> 01:34:03,011
if it's for relief from pain.

2163
01:34:03,013 --> 01:34:05,913
If it's in pursuit of pleasure,
that's a problem,

2164
01:34:05,915 --> 01:34:08,715
and I think that points to
something about our culture

2165
01:34:08,717 --> 01:34:10,983
that's a little bit odd.

2166
01:34:10,985 --> 01:34:14,119
What works for one doesn't
necessarily work for another.

2167
01:34:14,121 --> 01:34:16,688
<i>The father-son confrontation.</i>

2168
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:18,856
Mom smokes like a chimney.

2169
01:34:18,858 --> 01:34:21,725
And you have a drink
every day and smoke, too.

2170
01:34:21,727 --> 01:34:23,993
It's not the same. Why not?

2171
01:34:23,995 --> 01:34:27,796
You can get cancer,
your liver can rot away.

2172
01:34:27,798 --> 01:34:30,832
They believe today, and I'm
disappointed in the media,

2173
01:34:30,834 --> 01:34:33,100
that it hasn't brought this
information,

2174
01:34:33,102 --> 01:34:35,135
this new information to
the people of this country

2175
01:34:35,137 --> 01:34:37,103
more than it has,

2176
01:34:37,105 --> 01:34:40,005
they believe that marijuana
could well turn out to be

2177
01:34:40,007 --> 01:34:44,775
the most dangerous drug that
is in use in our country today.

2178
01:34:44,777 --> 01:34:46,843
If you're a politician,

2179
01:34:46,845 --> 01:34:50,046
you can get elected on
a get-tough-on-crime platform--

2180
01:34:50,048 --> 01:34:52,248
"We're gonna lock up all
the marijuana cultivators

2181
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:53,782
for a long time"--

2182
01:34:53,784 --> 01:34:55,817
'cause you're preying on
the fears of the public.

2183
01:34:55,819 --> 01:34:57,985
Spokesmen for giant
special-interest groups,

2184
01:34:57,987 --> 01:35:00,387
whether those special-interest
groups be law enforcement,

2185
01:35:00,389 --> 01:35:02,655
or whether
they're private prisons,

2186
01:35:02,657 --> 01:35:04,223
or whether they're
pharmaceutical companies

2187
01:35:04,225 --> 01:35:06,091
or whether they're
oil companies,

2188
01:35:06,093 --> 01:35:08,326
we have spokesmen
for gigantic corporations

2189
01:35:08,328 --> 01:35:10,394
that are trying to calm us
and get us

2190
01:35:10,396 --> 01:35:12,963
to press the right button
in the voting booth.

2191
01:35:12,965 --> 01:35:15,332
Everybody that gets in
has their own agenda.

2192
01:35:15,334 --> 01:35:17,200
They're beholden
to their own lobbyists,

2193
01:35:17,202 --> 01:35:19,702
so they don't go in and check
the work of anybody before them.

2194
01:35:19,704 --> 01:35:21,170
That's not their job,

2195
01:35:21,172 --> 01:35:22,905
because God forbid somebody
come in there

2196
01:35:22,907 --> 01:35:24,806
and check what
they do afterwards.

2197
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:26,874
I understand why politicians
may be reluctant

2198
01:35:26,876 --> 01:35:28,842
to act on their principles,

2199
01:35:28,844 --> 01:35:31,377
but our politicians
need to read their own polls,

2200
01:35:31,379 --> 01:35:33,912
because this is one
of those cases,

2201
01:35:33,914 --> 01:35:36,114
and it happens a lot in life,

2202
01:35:36,116 --> 01:35:39,317
where the people
are ahead of their leaders.

2203
01:35:41,754 --> 01:35:45,388
Hempfest, the largest event for
cannabis in the world,

2204
01:35:45,390 --> 01:35:48,991
a showcase of modern-day hemp.

2205
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:52,227
Sure, they used the stuff
70 years ago,

2206
01:35:52,229 --> 01:35:54,829
but what good is
hemp in a world like today?

2207
01:35:54,831 --> 01:35:57,865
A world that appears to have
everything it needs.

2208
01:35:57,867 --> 01:35:59,867
It opens a whole new market.

2209
01:35:59,869 --> 01:36:02,236
It opens a whole new market
on every level.

2210
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:03,971
You can harvest off the seeds,

2211
01:36:03,973 --> 01:36:06,773
you can harvest out the inner
pulp and the long-stem fibers.

2212
01:36:06,775 --> 01:36:08,307
The fiber itself

2213
01:36:08,309 --> 01:36:11,376
is the strongest natural fiber
in the world.

2214
01:36:11,378 --> 01:36:13,111
All the clothes
I'm wearing today

2215
01:36:13,113 --> 01:36:15,079
for this interview are hemp.

2216
01:36:15,081 --> 01:36:16,747
All the clothes I actually
always wear

2217
01:36:16,749 --> 01:36:18,115
are made out of hemp.

2218
01:36:18,117 --> 01:36:19,950
Been so since
probably '94 when I realized

2219
01:36:19,952 --> 01:36:21,818
I could buy clothes made out
of organic fibers

2220
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:23,719
that lasted longer than cotton.

2221
01:36:23,721 --> 01:36:26,154
You can eat hemp seeds, and it
contains all the essential

2222
01:36:26,156 --> 01:36:28,723
amino acids and fatty acids.

2223
01:36:28,725 --> 01:36:31,392
It makes fuel, you can make
biodiesel out of it.

2224
01:36:31,394 --> 01:36:33,861
Hemp is an excellent
source for biofuel.

2225
01:36:33,863 --> 01:36:35,362
When you grow hemp for fuel,

2226
01:36:35,364 --> 01:36:38,832
every crop unleashes a huge
amount of oxygen

2227
01:36:38,834 --> 01:36:40,233
into the environment,

2228
01:36:40,235 --> 01:36:42,468
and in fact, the same amount
of oxygen that you lose

2229
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:44,837
when you burn it off
you gain back,

2230
01:36:44,839 --> 01:36:47,973
so it's a closed cycle,
ending the greenhouse effect.

2231
01:36:47,975 --> 01:36:51,409
There are so many hundreds of
strains of industrial hemp

2232
01:36:51,411 --> 01:36:54,278
that you could grow hemp
almost anywhere in the world.

2233
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,846
Not everywhere in the world,

2234
01:36:55,848 --> 01:36:57,414
but almost everywhere
in the world,

2235
01:36:57,416 --> 01:37:02,018
so just that alone makes
it a resource for fuel.

2236
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:04,153
That is a solution,

2237
01:37:04,155 --> 01:37:07,256
is to stop using fossil fuels
and nuclear energy,

2238
01:37:07,258 --> 01:37:09,024
stop using them entirely,

2239
01:37:09,026 --> 01:37:12,160
and using wind and wave
and sun more,

2240
01:37:12,162 --> 01:37:13,995
and these biofuels.

2241
01:37:13,997 --> 01:37:18,733
People will get it, especially
as the gas prices go up.

2242
01:37:18,735 --> 01:37:22,069
It's the highest-
quality paper there is.

2243
01:37:22,071 --> 01:37:24,271
I mean, it's archival quality.

2244
01:37:24,273 --> 01:37:28,375
The words "tree-free paper"
don't make sense to people...

2245
01:37:28,377 --> 01:37:31,244
Hemp paper that
you find in the museums

2246
01:37:31,246 --> 01:37:33,846
that are hundreds of years old
haven't even yellowed.

2247
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:35,948
To supplement the wood,

2248
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:39,184
we could solve
the deforestation problem.

2249
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:41,920
Why isn't it cost-effective
to use hemp

2250
01:37:41,922 --> 01:37:45,089
versus the forest
industry right now?

2251
01:37:45,091 --> 01:37:47,891
The simple answer is because
you can't grow the hemp

2252
01:37:47,893 --> 01:37:50,160
in the United States.

2253
01:37:50,162 --> 01:37:52,195
As far as human beings
are concerned,

2254
01:37:52,197 --> 01:37:54,397
it's probably one of
the most useful plants ever,

2255
01:37:54,399 --> 01:37:56,599
if not<i> the</i> most useful
plant ever.

2256
01:37:56,601 --> 01:37:58,634
And it's illegal.

2257
01:37:58,636 --> 01:38:01,336
Industrial hemp is not a drug.

2258
01:38:01,338 --> 01:38:04,405
Though it is of
the same species as marijuana,

2259
01:38:04,407 --> 01:38:07,508
it is a completely different
variety of plant,

2260
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:11,445
similar to comparing
a Chihuahua with a St. Bernard.

2261
01:38:11,447 --> 01:38:13,914
You can't get high from
industrial hemp,

2262
01:38:13,916 --> 01:38:16,116
but you can get
high from marijuana.

2263
01:38:16,118 --> 01:38:18,485
This is the only industrialized
country in the world

2264
01:38:18,487 --> 01:38:20,653
that doesn't
grow industrial hemp.

2265
01:38:20,655 --> 01:38:23,889
I mean, think how crazy it is
that we can eat the product,

2266
01:38:23,891 --> 01:38:27,492
we can sell the product,
we can wear the product,

2267
01:38:27,494 --> 01:38:29,994
we can export the product,
import it,

2268
01:38:29,996 --> 01:38:33,530
manufacture it,
everything but grow it?

2269
01:38:33,532 --> 01:38:36,399
We can't grow this thing--
It's criminal.

2270
01:38:40,371 --> 01:38:42,938
And there you have it.

2271
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:46,074
After two years of research,
our quest for answers

2272
01:38:46,076 --> 01:38:48,476
has only left us
with more questions.

2273
01:38:51,948 --> 01:38:53,547
And the only thing

2274
01:38:53,549 --> 01:38:57,984
that really seems
to make sense...

2275
01:38:57,986 --> 01:39:02,455
is that none
of it makes any sense.

2276
01:39:02,457 --> 01:39:05,491
It's a weird thing that you do
when you make nature

2277
01:39:05,493 --> 01:39:07,459
against the law.

2278
01:39:07,461 --> 01:39:09,360
We're worried
about things going extinct,

2279
01:39:09,362 --> 01:39:12,096
and yet the policy on the most
useful plant in the world

2280
01:39:12,098 --> 01:39:13,931
is that they should
all be eliminated

2281
01:39:13,933 --> 01:39:15,632
and driven to extinction.

2282
01:39:15,634 --> 01:39:17,634
Absolutely, they should
still be concerned about

2283
01:39:17,636 --> 01:39:19,435
youngsters using it.

2284
01:39:19,437 --> 01:39:21,503
But we're concerned about
youngsters using alcohol,

2285
01:39:21,505 --> 01:39:24,072
tobacco, driving automobiles,
whatever.

2286
01:39:24,074 --> 01:39:28,109
But that it should be the kind
of Prohibition that it is now

2287
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:30,411
rather than regulation?

2288
01:39:30,413 --> 01:39:33,580
It cannot be sustained
in a rational society.

2289
01:39:33,582 --> 01:39:35,615
I believe that it would be more
ignorant of me

2290
01:39:35,617 --> 01:39:37,950
to listen to somebody
who's trying to oppress me

2291
01:39:37,952 --> 01:39:40,185
than it would be to just ignore
the ignorant

2292
01:39:40,187 --> 01:39:42,353
and go on with
what I think is right.

2293
01:39:42,355 --> 01:39:44,355
Even now, this interview
is being conducted,

2294
01:39:44,357 --> 01:39:46,090
and I smoked pot all morning.

2295
01:39:46,092 --> 01:39:47,558
This is what I look like high.

2296
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,293
There's a great quote that,

2297
01:39:49,295 --> 01:39:51,495
"Life is a tragedy
to those who feel

2298
01:39:51,497 --> 01:39:53,563
and a comedy
to those who think."

2299
01:39:53,565 --> 01:39:56,132
And if you are a thinker,

2300
01:39:56,134 --> 01:39:58,100
and you look at
the marijuana situation

2301
01:39:58,102 --> 01:40:01,103
and you're not laughing...

2302
01:40:01,105 --> 01:40:02,971
you're fucking dumb.

2303
01:40:02,973 --> 01:40:04,739
Do you think marijuana
will ever be legalized

2304
01:40:04,741 --> 01:40:07,441
in Canada or the United States?
Yes.

2305
01:40:07,443 --> 01:40:09,409
I don't know about
the United States,

2306
01:40:09,411 --> 01:40:11,611
but it will be legalized
in Canada.

2307
01:40:11,613 --> 01:40:14,146
I won't be alive to see it.

2308
01:40:14,148 --> 01:40:17,215
I used to believe it was right
around the corner

2309
01:40:17,217 --> 01:40:20,418
back in the 1970s.

2310
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:24,321
Check out the gray hair--
I confess to being 61.

2311
01:40:24,323 --> 01:40:26,656
I believe it will happen.

2312
01:40:26,658 --> 01:40:28,457
I didn't used to.

2313
01:40:28,459 --> 01:40:30,358
As recently as
two or three years ago,

2314
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:33,361
I was convinced it was not gonna
happen in my lifetime.

2315
01:40:33,363 --> 01:40:36,130
I wish you didn't
ask me that question,

2316
01:40:36,132 --> 01:40:39,700
but I would say...

2317
01:40:39,702 --> 01:40:41,735
I think it will be.

2318
01:40:41,737 --> 01:40:43,703
It's always a possibility.

2319
01:40:43,705 --> 01:40:45,771
There can be
breakthroughs to reason.

2320
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:49,241
All we have to do to end it
is get 50% of Congress

2321
01:40:49,243 --> 01:40:53,345
plus one human being to
say it's over, and it's over.

2322
01:40:53,347 --> 01:40:55,413
There's a movement
in this country,

2323
01:40:55,415 --> 01:40:58,282
and some people have more faith
in it than I do.

2324
01:40:58,284 --> 01:41:01,084
Maybe from hosting
"Fear Factor" all those years,

2325
01:41:01,086 --> 01:41:04,120
I've lost my faith in human
beings and their intelligence.

2326
01:41:04,122 --> 01:41:06,021
I think it's inevitable.

2327
01:41:06,023 --> 01:41:07,789
I believe that the truth
will set us free,

2328
01:41:07,791 --> 01:41:09,624
and I think
the truth is infectious.

2329
01:41:09,626 --> 01:41:12,159
And I think that while cannabis
per se is not addictive,

2330
01:41:12,161 --> 01:41:14,194
learning about it
quickly becomes.

2331
01:41:14,196 --> 01:41:16,729
When I published
"Marijuana Reconsidered,".

2332
01:41:16,731 --> 01:41:20,766
I, in the last chapter,
predicted that once people

2333
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:23,401
understood these things
about marijuana,

2334
01:41:23,403 --> 01:41:25,236
the Prohibition would be gone,

2335
01:41:25,238 --> 01:41:27,204
and it would be gone
in ten years.

2336
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:29,306
Carl Sagan, who was
a very good friend of mine,

2337
01:41:29,308 --> 01:41:31,207
read the manuscript and he said,

2338
01:41:31,209 --> 01:41:34,810
"Lester, you're so
pessimistic-- ten years?"

2339
01:41:34,812 --> 01:41:39,181
You know, well, here we are,
you know...

2340
01:41:39,183 --> 01:41:43,552
45 years later,
and nothing has happened.

2341
01:41:43,554 --> 01:41:47,722
Nonetheless, it can't help
but happen.

2342
01:41:47,724 --> 01:41:52,560
I mean, you can't sustain
a lie like that forever.

2343
01:41:53,305 --> 01:42:53,749
