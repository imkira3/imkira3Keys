- Yeah, one second.

00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:39,924
Oh Dre, I am so excited!
It's like we are brave pioneers,

on a quest to start a new life

You could say that.

00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:56,338
Okay, all right, let's go.

- Okay.

Be careful with that guys, okay?

00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:26,188

- C'mon Dre, we can't miss this plane!

15
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:31,640
Bye guys!
We're gonna miss you.

22
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:02,666
How are you?

23
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:09,838
- Remember what that one is?
- No.

24
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:12,433
Dre, you're killing me.

25
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:18,422
Mom, look, in China everything is old.
There's old houses, old parks...

26
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:24,160
old people...Look, this guy is at least
four-hundred years old.

27
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:26,761
Dre, please focus.
Okay?

28
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:32,989
What's your name?

29
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,898
You need to practice.
Yeah, you need to try.

30
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:35,856
No, mom.

31
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,484
- Yes, Dre. Dre...
- Mom?

32
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:42,329
- Ask him. Go ahead.
- No, mom.

33
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,159
Ask him "what's your name"
and "how are you". Do it, now.

34
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:02,782
Dude, I'm from Detroit.

35
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:11,097
What's up?

36
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,742
It's said to meet her
at number five.

37
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,754
Mrs. Packer?

38
00:06:29,246 --> 00:06:36,009
- Hi. It's Parker.
- Oh, apologies, Mrs. Parker. Welcome to Beijing.

39
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:02,820
Look! There is Omatek village.
Isn't it beautiful?

40
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:08,056
Yes. I guess there's nothing
old in China, huh Dre?

41
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:31,346
Look at that, Dre. Beverly Hills.

42
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:33,973
We've always talked about
living there, huh?

43
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:36,555
I think we have talked
about the other one, mom.

44
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:39,819
I got a good feeling about this.

45
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:48,680
Oh, yeah. You must be the new
dude in 305. I'm Harry.

46
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:51,451
- Hey, what's up? I'm Dre.
- Here. Let me help you.

47
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:53,888
Thanks, man.

48
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,624
- Welcome to the building, Dre.
- Thanks.

49
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:04,633
Can you please explain this electricity card,
because we-we don't have these in America.

50
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:12,569
- Know any Chinese?
- Nah.

51
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:16,272
This is China.
Might not be a bad idea.

52
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:21,324
Oh, that's our park.
You should come.

53
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:24,973
Look at you.
Making friends already.

54
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,754
- Hi, I'm Dre's mother.
- Nice to meet you.

55
00:08:27,764 --> 00:08:29,946
Nice to meet you too.
You can call me Miss Sherry.

56
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:32,035
- I'm Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

57
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:35,384
- So, I guess, I'll see you later, then?
- Maybe.

58
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:37,749
Okay, cool. See you.

59
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:49,748
Ok, this is your rental agreement in English.

60
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:54,401
So the landlady is Mrs. Wong.
Her English is not good.

61
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,659
But if something goes wrong,
you go to Mr. Han.

62
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,119
- His English is very good.
- Okay.

63
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:03,710
Okay. So, welcome to Beijing, Mrs. Parker.
Um, so I see you tomorrow, okay?

64
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:07,372
Okay, sure! Thank you.
Oh, wait, wait!

65
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:10,333
<i>Um, you mentioned something
about going...</i>

66
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:26,264
Oh, this is perfect, Dre. Everything we
need is in walking distance.

67
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,273
Oh, you know what,
we can have lunch together

68
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:30,254
every day at your school,
if you wanted to.

69
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:32,601
Negative! Not a chance.

70
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:40,286
Dre, we are not doing this in Beijing.

71
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:44,388
Dre, pick up your jacket!

72
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:47,919
Mom, I'm tired, okay?
I have airplane lag.

73
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:55,368
Airplane...

74
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:59,487
It's jet lag.

75
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:03,135
I know baby, I got it too.

76
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:10,994
But, we can't go to sleep. Cause then we'll
be up at 2 A.M. You have school tomorrow.

77
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,412
<i>Dre, can you please go
find the maintenance man?!</i>

78
00:10:25,413 --> 00:10:28,082
<i>I need to take a shower,
and the hot water is broken!</i>

79
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:28,812
Yes.

80
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:33,115
Excuse me.

81
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:37,121
Um, the maintenance man?
Mr. Han?

82
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:42,720
Thanks.

83
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:57,484
Mr. Han?

84
00:10:57,485 --> 00:11:03,310
Me and my mom, we just moved in. 305.
The hot water is not working.

85
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:08,704
Mr. Han?

86
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:17,784
Okay. Alright I just come back another time.

87
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:22,082
Or you can just show me how to do it so,
I can get out of your hair.

88
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,081
Um, I can always come back
if this is bad time.

89
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:32,499
- Hey man, you made it. Welcome.
- Thanks.

90
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,225
- You play, right? C'mon.
- Yeah.

91
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:42,693
- Us three against them four.
- All right.

92
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:55,233
Pass!

93
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:04,287
What's up?
What's up?

94
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:08,422
My shooting hand.
Got some jet lag so...

95
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:10,350
You know, I'm just...

96
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:28,152
You want this?

97
00:13:28,153 --> 00:13:32,568
You want me to play? You know
I have no problem beatin' old people.

98
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,315
Back where I come from they call me
"Ping Pong Dre", alright?

99
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:41,400
I'm going to take it easy on you.

100
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,792
Come on, man.
I'm twelve.

101
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:25,329
He is really good.
I've never seen him lose to anybody.

102
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:27,257
Yeah.

103
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:34,221
- Dude. You're gonna talk to her or what?
- To who?

104
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:38,449
- To her. The girl you've been staring at.
- I wasn't staring at her, dude.

105
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,853
Yeah, you were.

106
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:47,038
- You should go talk to her, unless you're scared?
- I'm not scared of anything.

107
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,671
Then do it. Go.
Come on.

108
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:54,832
Right now.

109
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:03,630
Hey, what's up?

110
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:10,151
I forgot.
No English, um...

111
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:21,053
What language was that?

112
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:24,036
You speak English?
Me too.

113
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:29,374
- So, what are you listening to?
- Bach.

114
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:34,859
Bach, I listen to them all the time.
They are tight. Have you ever heard of this?

115
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:44,234
Oh yeah, you like it huh, right?!

116
00:15:56,951 --> 00:16:01,292
Great move, one over here.

117
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:06,177
- Wait, wait it's coming back.
- May I touch your hair?

118
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:11,002
You want to touch my hair?

119
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:16,395
Um...Sure.

120
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,723
You shoud be practicing.

121
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:31,423
I'm practicing.

122
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,890
- What you're doing, you won't be needing these.
- What's your problem?

123
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:35,685
Leave it.

124
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:44,562
Come on, dude.

125
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:50,270
I said, leave it.

126
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,933
You want to fight?

127
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:36,309
- Are you okay?
- Leave me alone.

128
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:38,998
I'm fine.

129
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:44,706
- Dre, dude...
- Leave me alone.

130
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:27,462
Dre, are you ready?
Cause we got to be there in like 20 minutes.

131
00:18:27,463 --> 00:18:29,677
I know, mom.

132
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:32,254
- And you have your uniform on, right?
- Yes, mom.

133
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:34,892
Don't break any rules
on the first day.

134
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:39,926
Okay, come on, I'm waiting for you.

135
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:51,152
Wait, you don't have to comin', I mean...
I can handle it.

136
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:53,414
Dre, don't be silly, it's your first day.

137
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:56,627
Plus, we both have to meet the
assist principal Mrs. Pong.

138
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:59,963
I can find her.
You need to get to work, right?!

139
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:02,449
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- No, mom.

140
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:07,388
Mrs. Pong.
Hi, Mrs. Pong.

141
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:10,705
- Mrs. Parker,  we've been waiting.
- I'm so sorry we are late...

142
00:19:10,706 --> 00:19:12,578
We just flew from Detroit last night...

143
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:15,375
- And this is my son Dre.
- Hello.

144
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:20,559
- We only wear uniforms on Uniform day.
- Oh, that's my fault.

145
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,482
I didn't have a chance to read the school packages
sent to me. Will be better tomorrow.

146
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:32,228
- And hats are not permitted.
- Yeah, I should've read up on the dress code.

147
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:37,203
- Dre, is that make-up? What is that?
- Mom, I ran into a pole.

148
00:19:37,204 --> 00:19:42,207
- No, you have a black eye. You've got into a fight?
- Fighting is not tolerated here.

149
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,710
You heard him, he ran into a pole.
Come here, Dre.

150
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:47,642
- Mom, don't start.
- Who did it?

151
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:50,799
Nobody mom, I ran into a pole. I ain't tell
you cause I know you would react like this.

152
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,799
Dre, you know I don't play,
if somebody hit my baby, I would tear...

153
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,814
I know mom,
that's why I don't tell you stuff.

154
00:19:56,815 --> 00:19:59,988
- Just relax, I just ran into a...
- Yeah, yeah,  you ran into a pole.

155
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:09,946
Alright Dre, alright, alright. Look, go to class,
go to  class, but we will talk about this later.

156
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:13,061
Okay? Alright, go!

157
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:18,110
- I love you.
- Mom?!

158
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,766
I said I love you.

159
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:25,426
- Okay, I love you too.
- Okay, have a good day.

160
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:45,091
- Hi.
- Hey!

161
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:56,508
You know,
we only wear uniforms on Uniform day.

162
00:20:56,995 --> 00:21:01,309
Oh yeah, I still got that one.

163
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:07,064
Thanks.

164
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:11,021
- I'm Meiying.
- I'm Dre.

165
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:21,125
Sorry about Cheng.

166
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:24,297
So that's his name?!

167
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:27,660
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No.

168
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:32,365
- Our parents are very close.
- He definitely likes you.

169
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:36,958
- I have to go practice.
- Wait...

170
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:41,084
- You eat and practice at the same time?
- Yes.

171
00:21:41,085 --> 00:21:46,136
But, my mom says if you eat standing up,
it gives you gas.

172
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:49,219
You're funny.

173
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,072
- Come to fix the hot water.
- It's in there.

174
00:22:57,383 --> 00:22:59,944
Kid?
Kid?!

175
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:20,214
Did you just hit me in my neck
with a toothpaste cap?!

176
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,588
Hot water fine.
Flip switch.

177
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:28,084
Wait half hour, take shower,
flip switch off.

178
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:30,657
Why don't you just leave it on?

179
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:34,404
- You leave on in America?
- We don't have a switch in America.

180
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:37,478
Get switch,
Save planet.

181
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:42,998
- What happened to your eye?
- I ran into a pole.

182
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,716
Interesting pole.

183
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:50,570
- Dre?! I'm back.
- That's my mom.

184
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:52,438
End it, do the handle, it's messed up.

185
00:23:52,462 --> 00:23:54,850
<i>- Are you ready for school?
- Yeah.</i>

186
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:01,219
- Hey, let me help you.
- They have your favorite cereal here, I found it.

187
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:15,225
Dre, for the one hundredth time,
can you please pick up your jacket?

188
00:24:15,226 --> 00:24:19,097
- One second, mom.
- No! Not in one second, now!

189
00:24:19,512 --> 00:24:20,955
This programme is about to be over.
Give me two minutes.

190
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:24,053
Dre, I don't care!
Come and pick it up now.

191
00:24:24,054 --> 00:24:27,745
- God, how many times do I have to ask you?
- Once.

192
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:30,531
- That's right. Make it happen.
- "What's with you and the jacket?!"

193
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:32,229
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Nothing.

194
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:34,410
Okay, just what I thought...
Nothing.

195
00:24:35,714 --> 00:24:38,127
Thank you.

196
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:01,051
From the top again.

197
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:32,756
Okay. It's enough please. You are rushing it.
You must play the pauses.

198
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:38,359
Do you know how important this is for your family?
What it will mean for your life?

199
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,847
We have to work this weekend.
I'm calling you father.

200
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:49,316
We continue.

201
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:02,786
- How that sound?
- Almost like a Chinese.

202
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:07,852
Yeah, I'm fluent. And I don't know about that guy
was talking about? I thought you sounded great.

203
00:27:07,853 --> 00:27:10,168
Thank you.

204
00:27:17,578 --> 00:27:25,791
- So, you are practicing for anything? Like a show?
- Yes, I have an audition next month...

205
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:32,600
- For the Beijing Academy of Music.
- Beijing Academy of Music. Sounds important.

206
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:38,979
You know, their initials spell BAM.

207
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:44,634
What?

208
00:27:46,753 --> 00:27:49,112
I gotta go.

209
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:13,694
Can I touch your hair?

210
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:22,254
You're gonna do something?

211
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:26,915
Just stay away from us.

212
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:30,703
All of us.

213
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,576
Baby?!

214
00:28:54,217 --> 00:28:57,283
Dre, are you sleeping?

215
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:31,703
- Um, can you sign this?
- For the Forbidden City?!

216
00:29:31,704 --> 00:29:36,353
I think it's funny that you have to give
my permission to go to the Forbidden City.

217
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,461
- Pole in Beijing.
- Not funny, mom.

218
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:42,676
Oh, cut it out, grumpy.

219
00:29:42,685 --> 00:29:45,532
I'm serious, Dre. This ice cream,
I don't know what they do it,

220
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,632
but it's more flavoristic. What?

221
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:53,955
Mom, this is you. "Oh my Godness, this ice cream
here is so good, and everything in China...

222
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:56,951
is so much better than everything else..."
Aw, mom c'mon...

223
00:29:56,952 --> 00:30:00,875
First of all, I don't sound like that,
and I don't move all like that.

224
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:04,894
You should get some ice cream, sweetie.

225
00:30:04,926 --> 00:30:08,281
- Mom, mom,  c'mon.
- Dre! Wait!

226
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:12,129
Boy, you won't get running from me?!

227
00:30:15,457 --> 00:30:17,462
Kung Fu.

228
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:03,186
What do we learn here?

229
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:06,766
No weakness! No pain! No mercy!

230
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:16,997
Begin!

231
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:27,557
- Mom, mom, c'mon, let's go. C'mon, mom!
- What? Dre, we just got here.

232
00:31:28,725 --> 00:31:32,734
- Dre, what's going on?
- Nothing.

233
00:31:33,082 --> 00:31:36,196
- Dre, what happened?
- Nothing happened.

234
00:31:36,368 --> 00:31:40,521
What is it, you don't want to take that class?
Whatever Dre, What happened?

235
00:31:40,755 --> 00:31:45,688
We moved to China!
That's what happened!

236
00:31:59,729 --> 00:32:01,684
Okay, stop.

237
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,738
Don't be like that, Dre.

238
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:10,886
What do you want me to do?

239
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:13,680
- We've been here less than a week...
- I feel like it's a year!

240
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,803
I hate it here.

241
00:32:21,989 --> 00:32:24,961
Dre, please let me help you.

242
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:29,580
I can't help you if you don't tell
me what's wrong?! Oh, please.

243
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:32,351
You don't care what's wrong!

244
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:36,000
All you care about is how happy I am
and how great ice cream is.

245
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:40,642
I'm not happy.
I hate it here!

246
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,908
I want to go home!

247
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:59,596
Dre, we can't go home. Okay?
There is nothing left for us in Detroit.

248
00:32:59,597 --> 00:33:02,801
This is what we've got.

249
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:07,335
This is home.

250
00:33:33,024 --> 00:33:34,849
<i>Gather on here.</i>

251
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,642
<i>Welcome to one of the most popular
landmarks in all over China.</i>

252
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:41,827
<i>It is visited by millions of people
every year.</i>

253
00:33:41,828 --> 00:33:45,002
<i>The Forbidden City.</i>

254
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:25,123
You plaster on for good luck.

255
00:34:44,064 --> 00:34:48,148
- I wish someone would just...
- Yeah, me too.

256
00:34:49,645 --> 00:34:53,120
- Just tell someone.
- Yeah, I got it.

257
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:55,705
Thanks a lot.

258
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:08,917
<i>The walls of the palace were reinforced
with the bricks, 15 layers deep,</i>

259
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:12,286
<i>to prevent anyone
from coming in.</i>

260
00:35:16,476 --> 00:35:19,934
- Mr. Parker... Is everything okay?
- Oh yes?

261
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:25,801
Um...Yes, thank you.

262
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,814
Get him.

263
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:38,120
Come on.

264
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:18,939
You're fast.

265
00:39:20,597 --> 00:39:23,410
But not fast enough.

266
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:42,049
He's had enough.

267
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,350
Don't you remember what we learned?

268
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:44,332
No weakness. No pain.

269
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:48,985
No mercy!

270
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,295
Go home.

271
00:42:18,623 --> 00:42:21,513
- What's up with the light bulbs, Mr. Han?
- Shh!

272
00:42:59,648 --> 00:43:02,237
I thought you are just a maintenance man?

273
00:43:02,238 --> 00:43:05,982
You've seen only with your eyes,
so you are easy to fool.

274
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:10,982
It doesn't hurt.

275
00:43:10,996 --> 00:43:13,530
Chauva.
Ancient Chinese healing.

276
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:19,659
How did you do that up there? You like even
didn't punch them. They...beat each other up.

277
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,113
When fighting angry, blind men...

278
00:43:22,114 --> 00:43:25,273
best we just stay out of the way.

279
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:31,196
- So, where did you learn Kung Fu?
- From father.

280
00:43:31,647 --> 00:43:33,902
Have you ever taught anybody?

281
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,866
No.

282
00:43:37,327 --> 00:43:40,073
Would you?

283
00:43:40,478 --> 00:43:43,078
- Depends.
- On what?

284
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,227
- Reason.
- What about to kick somebody's ass?

285
00:43:50,523 --> 00:43:53,505
The best fights are the ones we avoid.

286
00:43:53,895 --> 00:43:56,339
What if I wanna avoid getting
my ass kicked?

287
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,488
- Stop saying "ass".
- Sorry.

288
00:44:04,396 --> 00:44:07,041
Kung Fu is for knowledge, defense.

289
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:10,256
Not to make war,
but to create peace.

290
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:12,345
That's not definitely what they're taught.

291
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:17,137
No such thing as bad student,
only bad teacher.

292
00:44:17,192 --> 00:44:22,493
That's great. I guess we'll just stroll in
their school and talk to their teacher.

293
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:25,442
- Good idea.
- No, bad idea.

294
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,802
If I go in there, I get my ass kick...

295
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:34,148
- I'll get beat up.
- You got beat up anyway.

296
00:44:38,848 --> 00:44:41,704
Would you go with me?

297
00:44:42,376 --> 00:44:45,266
No, sorry.

298
00:44:46,054 --> 00:44:49,536
- But you said it was a good idea.
- For you, bad idea for me.

299
00:44:49,537 --> 00:44:53,417
C'mon, it's not like you should be busy
or anything...I don't even speak Chinese.

300
00:44:54,142 --> 00:44:56,490
Very sorry.

301
00:45:01,588 --> 00:45:06,078
Okay...Whatever.

302
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:23,714
Wait!

303
00:46:02,398 --> 00:46:06,757
What are you doing?
Why did you stop?

304
00:46:07,516 --> 00:46:10,524
Finish!

305
00:46:14,046 --> 00:46:17,023
Okay, Mr. Han, let's get out of here.

306
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:24,207
We do not stop when our enemy is down!

307
00:46:24,765 --> 00:46:26,401
No mercy.

308
00:46:26,434 --> 00:46:28,435
No mercy in the studio.

309
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:31,337
No mercy in life.

310
00:46:36,034 --> 00:46:38,495
What are you looking at?

311
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:41,674
He's the one that attacked me.

312
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:57,421
We are here to make peace.

313
00:46:58,684 --> 00:47:00,893
Let your little thing mind himself.

314
00:47:02,136 --> 00:47:08,540
One to one, no problem...Six to one,
too much to ask of anyone.

315
00:47:09,088 --> 00:47:11,640
I see.

316
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:14,265
Prepare for match!

317
00:47:17,149 --> 00:47:20,150
Whoa Mr. Han, does he want us to fight?

318
00:47:22,404 --> 00:47:25,989
We are not here to fight.

319
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:33,633
You attack my students
and disrespect my studio?!

320
00:47:33,936 --> 00:47:37,550
You want to leave?
Not so easy.

321
00:47:38,675 --> 00:47:41,482
Master Li...

322
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:46,382
You both came here.

323
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:50,814
One of you fights now.

324
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,992
The boy will fight there.

325
00:48:01,861 --> 00:48:04,808
OPEN KUNG FU TOURNAMENT

326
00:48:11,287 --> 00:48:14,983
We accept your challenge.

327
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:21,864
Please instruct your students
to leave my boy alone to train.

328
00:48:23,195 --> 00:48:25,335
Attention!

329
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:30,968
From now on the little thing
is to be left alone...

330
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:33,047
until the tournament.

331
00:48:33,062 --> 00:48:36,227
- Understood?!
- Yes!

332
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:45,356
If he does not show up
for the competition...

333
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:50,405
I will bring pain to him and you.

334
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:04,020
So, that go pretty much
how you planned it?

335
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,203
There's good news and bad news.

336
00:49:06,225 --> 00:49:09,435
The good news is they promised
to leave you alone.

337
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:13,489
- Really?
- While you prepare.

338
00:49:13,715 --> 00:49:16,235
Prepare for what?

339
00:49:16,236 --> 00:49:20,745
The tournament.
You'll fight them all, one by one.

340
00:49:21,346 --> 00:49:23,601
Huh?

341
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:28,343
So the bad news is now
they get to beat me up in public.

342
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,784
- Yes.
- Great. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

343
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:34,625
They're gonna kill me.
You saw their Kung Fu.

344
00:49:34,927 --> 00:49:38,709
That's not Kung Fu. That does not
represent China.

345
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:43,133
That bad man teach them really bad
things that hurt, a lot.

346
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,668
More good news.
I will teach you real Kung Fu.

347
00:49:53,397 --> 00:49:55,323
Yes.

348
00:50:04,381 --> 00:50:09,359
- See you later, mom.
- Hey, wait. This is early for you for a Saturday.

349
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,490
- Mr. Han will teach me Kung Fu.
- The maintenance man?

350
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:14,954
It's China mom,
everybody knows Kung Fu.

351
00:50:14,955 --> 00:50:16,487
Dre, you know how do I feel about
your fighting.

352
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:20,058
Kung Fu is not fight mom, it's about
making peace with your enemy.

353
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:23,163
- Be careful, Dre.
- Yeah.

354
00:51:01,578 --> 00:51:03,956
Mr. Han?

355
00:51:25,288 --> 00:51:29,230
- Mr. Han?
- Back here.

356
00:51:31,404 --> 00:51:34,646
You know you have a car
in your living room, Mr. Han?

357
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:41,984
Okay, I was thinking about yesterday. I know
I was kinda freaking out about the tournament...

358
00:51:41,985 --> 00:51:44,454
but I realized something last night.

359
00:51:44,506 --> 00:51:50,371
I'm an athlete. My number one asset
is I'm fast, okay?!

360
00:51:50,372 --> 00:51:54,883
I'm quick. I'm quick.
Got the speed. Cat speed.

361
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:58,999
You see? I'm quick yeah, you see?
In the US, I used to take gymnastic at PAL,

362
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,202
that's Police Athletic League, to check it,
right?

363
00:52:03,113 --> 00:52:05,736
Boom. You see that?

364
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:12,578
My Uncle Reymi used to date that
Brazilian girl and he learned Jiu-Jitsu.

365
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:15,694
And he taught some of it to me.
As like, locks and holds and stuff, it's okay.

366
00:52:15,695 --> 00:52:18,209
Attack me.

367
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:26,288
You see that? Feel that?
I can break it.

368
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:29,428
I'm choosing not to.
To press your luck. It's dangerous.

369
00:52:29,429 --> 00:52:32,224
And he also taught me Capoeira so...

370
00:52:32,225 --> 00:52:35,757
Can't touch me. Can't touch...

371
00:52:39,752 --> 00:52:42,534
Was that antique?

372
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:46,918
Pick up your jacket.

373
00:52:48,648 --> 00:52:51,365
So basically Mr. Han,
what I'm trying to say is...

374
00:52:51,366 --> 00:52:55,222
I got a good foundation here.
You know, like I said. I'm just...

375
00:52:55,786 --> 00:52:58,908
Might not be as hard to teach me
as other people, you know.

376
00:52:58,955 --> 00:53:01,191
- Hang it up.
- Okay.

377
00:53:01,854 --> 00:53:06,599
- Happy now?
- Take it down.

378
00:53:08,513 --> 00:53:12,233
- You just...
- Take it down.

379
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,155
Put it on.

380
00:53:21,977 --> 00:53:24,365
Take it off.

381
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,574
- I already did all of this.
- Take it off.

382
00:53:26,584 --> 00:53:28,033
Can you just tell me,
why I'm doing this?

383
00:53:28,034 --> 00:53:30,118
Take it off.

384
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:35,986
Hang it up.

385
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,839
Take it down.

386
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,424
Put it on the ground.

387
00:53:45,478 --> 00:53:48,123
Pick it up.

388
00:53:48,782 --> 00:53:50,420
Hang up.

389
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:53,067
Take it down.

390
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,284
Put it on.

391
00:53:58,518 --> 00:54:00,790
Take it off.

392
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,112
Put it on the ground.

393
00:54:04,381 --> 00:54:06,646
Pick it up.

394
00:54:07,095 --> 00:54:09,541
Hang it up.

395
00:54:09,784 --> 00:54:14,685
Take it down.
Put it on.

396
00:54:15,147 --> 00:54:17,809
Take it off.

397
00:54:17,985 --> 00:54:21,146
Hang it up.

398
00:54:29,454 --> 00:54:34,402
Mr. Han, why do you have
a car in your living room?

399
00:54:34,403 --> 00:54:37,327
No street parking.

400
00:54:44,204 --> 00:54:46,557
Hey!

401
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:50,920
So how did it go?
What you learned?

402
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,737
Nothing.

403
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,288
Uniform on Uniform day.

404
00:55:31,289 --> 00:55:36,265
- You're fighting in the tournament?
- Yeah, how did you hear?

405
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,085
Everybody knows.

406
00:55:40,644 --> 00:55:47,158
- I hope you have a good teacher.
- Yeah, me too.

407
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:49,557
He's a maintenance man.

408
00:55:49,815 --> 00:55:52,173
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

409
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:58,558
Well, I know you're practicing, and I think I'm practicing, I mean,
I don't know what I'm doing...

410
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:05,105
- But, we both kind of practicing, you know and...
- Are you going to that Shi-Shi festival?

411
00:56:05,107 --> 00:56:11,176
Yeah, I mean, I've missed
the Shi-Di Festival since I've been in China.

412
00:56:13,465 --> 00:56:19,591
- Go to the Shaolin theater.
- Okay. You want me to meet you?

413
00:56:20,273 --> 00:56:26,655
Oh, oh, so like Shaolin theater, okay Shi-Fi-Shi festival.
Shaolin theater, okay. Cool.

414
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:31,476
- When is it again?
- Tomorrow. The show starts at seven.

415
00:56:31,504 --> 00:56:36,844
Okay. So tomorrow, Shaolin theater.
Shi-Shi festival at seven.

416
00:56:36,845 --> 00:56:39,866
- See you tomorrow.
- Shi-Shi festival.

417
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:43,628
- Festival. - Shi-Shi festival.
- Okay. - Okay.

418
00:57:05,863 --> 00:57:07,659
Mr. Han?

419
00:57:07,884 --> 00:57:12,463
- Mr. Han, can I come in?
- You may come in.

420
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:19,549
Where's your jacket?

421
00:57:21,124 --> 00:57:25,004
- I thought, I was warmin' up without it.
- Go get it.

422
00:57:25,005 --> 00:57:27,292
You want me to go
all way back, just to get it?

423
00:57:27,299 --> 00:57:30,649
Yes, all the way back
where you hide it.

424
00:57:56,421 --> 00:58:01,065
- This is not right.
- What? I'm doing it.

425
00:58:02,998 --> 00:58:05,359
No.

426
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,655
- Something is missing.
- Nothing is missing.

427
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:20,022
You forgot, this.

428
00:58:20,983 --> 00:58:22,869
Attitude.

429
00:58:23,971 --> 00:58:26,225
Shake it off.

430
00:58:29,934 --> 00:58:34,890
Attitude.
Yes, that's it.

431
00:58:34,891 --> 00:58:39,224
Okay, Mr. Han. I get it. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have treated my mom like that.

432
00:58:39,225 --> 00:58:40,849
You're right.

433
00:58:44,361 --> 00:58:48,949
- Put it on the ground.
- Hello.

434
00:58:49,494 --> 00:58:53,788
Ow, hey mom.
Um, did you get the tickets?

435
00:58:53,934 --> 00:59:00,081
Yes, I got the tickets,
and I got an extra one for Mr. Han.

436
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:03,891
- But I didn't say...
- Dre, stop it.

437
00:59:03,892 --> 00:59:07,708
Mr. Han, would you like to go with us
to the Shi-Shi festival?

438
00:59:07,709 --> 00:59:10,952
No, thank you.
Too many people.

439
00:59:10,953 --> 00:59:15,350
- Yeah, mom. Way too many people.
- Yeah, but I already bought the tickets.

440
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:18,216
- I don't go...
- Mr. Han, I'm not taking "no" for an answer.

441
00:59:18,218 --> 00:59:21,150
You'll have fun. You need
to get out the house, okay?

442
00:59:21,151 --> 00:59:24,811
Here are your clothes, Dre.
Come on, hurry up and change.

443
00:59:28,752 --> 00:59:29,700
Dre...

444
00:59:30,873 --> 00:59:34,176
Pick up your jacket!

445
00:59:45,637 --> 00:59:49,941
You were right Mr. Han,
there are a lot of people here.

446
00:59:49,942 --> 00:59:52,026
Chinese Valentine's Day.

447
01:00:05,771 --> 01:00:10,822
Yeah, Mom. I'm going to go get something
to eat, then going to go to the bathroom.

448
01:00:10,823 --> 01:00:13,166
Be back, right here,
in 20 minutes.

449
01:00:14,988 --> 01:00:18,221
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Be careful. 20 minutes.

450
01:00:18,222 --> 01:00:21,314
- 20.
- Okay.

451
01:01:14,187 --> 01:01:16,613
I got this, and this for you.

452
01:01:16,614 --> 01:01:21,441
I downloaded this.
It has a very cool violins stuff, and I...

453
01:01:21,442 --> 01:01:25,533
I thought maybe you could play along and...
It's not like Bach and...

454
01:01:25,534 --> 01:01:29,078
but, I thought maybe
you'd like it and...

455
01:01:54,517 --> 01:02:00,251
- So, um, do you have any kids?
- No.

456
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:04,495
Oh, how's Dre doing?

457
01:02:04,615 --> 01:02:08,580
- Um, Shao Dre making a progress.
- Shao Dre?

458
01:02:08,581 --> 01:02:11,781
Yes, Chinese pollito.

459
01:02:13,577 --> 01:02:16,692
So, um, how many students do you have?

460
01:02:17,644 --> 01:02:20,266
- Including Shao Dre?
- Yeah.

461
01:02:21,063 --> 01:02:23,276
One.

462
01:02:29,397 --> 01:02:32,060
So, what's the show about?

463
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:36,721
It's the story of the Goddess...

464
01:02:36,722 --> 01:02:39,385
and a boy she loves.

465
01:02:39,513 --> 01:02:43,243
I love this story.

466
01:02:44,797 --> 01:02:48,295
Her mother does not approve of him.

467
01:02:48,296 --> 01:02:55,685
So, she cuts a wide river in the sky
to separate them forever.

468
01:02:55,686 --> 01:03:00,481
But once a year,
all the birds in the sky...

469
01:03:00,824 --> 01:03:05,947
felt sad for them,
and they form a bridge.

470
01:03:07,035 --> 01:03:14,755
So the two of them may be
together for a single night.

471
01:03:21,184 --> 01:03:25,244
I'll be there at you audition,
if you come to my tournament.

472
01:03:25,687 --> 01:03:29,372
- Okay, I'll be there.
- Pinky swear.

473
01:03:30,578 --> 01:03:33,232
See, you wrap your hands like this.

474
01:03:33,563 --> 01:03:38,746
I swear that I'll be there at your audition,
no matter what happens.

475
01:03:38,747 --> 01:03:44,449
And I promise to cheer bigger
than anyone else when you win.

476
01:04:21,997 --> 01:04:24,374
What up, Mr. Han?

477
01:04:25,496 --> 01:04:28,037
Did I say come in?

478
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:31,369
Um, I think you did. I mean...

479
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:39,550
- Mr. Han, can I please come in?
- Yes.

480
01:04:41,959 --> 01:04:45,982
- So, what we are doing today?
- Same.

481
01:05:33,715 --> 01:05:40,221
Mr. Han, I told you. I get it, okay?
Be respectful! I got it!

482
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:45,390
I put my jacket on a thousand times,
and I took it off a thousand times, okay?

483
01:05:45,391 --> 01:05:48,127
This is stupid. I'm done!

484
01:05:48,128 --> 01:05:50,926
Let them beat me up,
if they want to.

485
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:56,488
You know why you only have
one student? 'Cause you don't know Kung Fu.

486
01:05:56,489 --> 01:06:00,096
- Shao Dre!
- What?

487
01:06:04,979 --> 01:06:07,439
Come here.

488
01:06:15,154 --> 01:06:19,088
- Jacket on!
- Mr. Han, I already...- Jacket on!

489
01:06:28,499 --> 01:06:33,111
- Jacket on!
- I don't have a jacket...- Jacket on!

490
01:06:39,932 --> 01:06:42,338
Be strong.

491
01:06:42,339 --> 01:06:44,888
Jacket on.

492
01:06:45,196 --> 01:06:47,962
Firm.

493
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:50,755
Jacket off.

494
01:06:52,097 --> 01:06:54,178
Remember...

495
01:06:54,193 --> 01:06:59,150
always strong...
Jacket off.

496
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,870
Strong.

497
01:07:05,585 --> 01:07:08,492
Left foot back.
Right foot back.

498
01:07:08,493 --> 01:07:10,830
Left foot back.
Pick up your jacket!

499
01:07:12,345 --> 01:07:15,378
- Whoa, Mr. ...- Focus!
- Okay. - Always concentrate.

500
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:20,002
Left back. Right foot back.
Pick up your jacket!

501
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:22,676
Stay.

502
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,103
Pick up your jacket.

503
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:32,294
Strong.

504
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:34,173
Hang it up.

505
01:07:34,329 --> 01:07:36,173
Hang it up.

506
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:39,653
And attitude!

507
01:07:40,148 --> 01:07:42,285
Strike!

508
01:07:42,286 --> 01:07:44,741
Hang up and attitude!

509
01:07:44,742 --> 01:07:47,953
Harder.
Harder.

510
01:07:50,246 --> 01:07:54,344
Good, but no face.

511
01:07:54,648 --> 01:07:56,820
Jacket off!

512
01:08:18,696 --> 01:08:22,795
Kung Fu lives in everything
we do, Shao Dre.

513
01:08:22,981 --> 01:08:28,104
It lives in how we put on a jacket,
and how we take off the jacket.

514
01:08:28,249 --> 01:08:31,446
It lives in
how we treat people.

515
01:08:33,005 --> 01:08:38,464
Everything is Kung Fu.

516
01:09:21,381 --> 01:09:27,488
- So, why do not we take the Shiroko?
- I don't drive the Shiroko.

517
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:33,725
- Do you have a license?
- Yes.

518
01:09:33,727 --> 01:09:39,587
So you have a license and a car
and we're in the train?

519
01:09:40,382 --> 01:09:43,922
- Please, be quiet.
- I'm just sayin'...

520
01:09:43,923 --> 01:09:48,104
seems like we could've saved
a lot of money, don't you think?

521
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:55,049
- Do you always ask these many questions?
- I'm sorry.

522
01:09:55,804 --> 01:09:58,714
So, what we are learning today?

523
01:10:00,011 --> 01:10:02,469
Chi.

524
01:10:02,921 --> 01:10:09,645
Eternal Energy.
The essence of life.

525
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:13,874
It moves inside of us,
flows through our bodies.

526
01:10:13,875 --> 01:10:17,126
Give us power from within.

527
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:25,642
I get it,
like the "Force" from Star Wars.

528
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:31,270
You're Yoda,
and I'm like... I'm like a Jedi.

529
01:11:03,434 --> 01:11:07,205
- Is this where you learned Kung Fu?
- Yes.

530
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:11,598
Everything good about me
was born here.

531
01:11:12,084 --> 01:11:15,922
So Dre, you gotta leave your backpack
and skateboard here.

532
01:11:15,923 --> 01:11:19,432
- So, where are we going?
- The journey to the top of the mountain.

533
01:11:19,433 --> 01:11:22,302
Tomb of the Dragon Well.

534
01:11:24,544 --> 01:11:30,743
Dragon Well? It's probably,
closer than it is, I'm looking at it.

535
01:11:31,517 --> 01:11:34,128
Right?

536
01:12:01,503 --> 01:12:05,560
- Are we there yet?
- Soon.

537
01:12:07,762 --> 01:12:11,572
- How do you say water in Chinese?
- Shui.

538
01:12:11,685 --> 01:12:14,308
I need some shui.

539
01:12:14,601 --> 01:12:18,857
I'm really thirsty.

540
01:12:22,124 --> 01:12:27,288
- I'm thirsty, Mr. Han.
- Water on top of the mountain.

541
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,312
Shao Dre.

542
01:14:56,012 --> 01:14:59,003
The journey is complete.

543
01:15:01,148 --> 01:15:07,085
- This is the Dragon Well?
- Yes.

544
01:15:11,401 --> 01:15:16,668
I stood here with my father,
when I was your age.

545
01:15:16,669 --> 01:15:21,587
He told me that's the magic
Kung Fu water.

546
01:15:30,089 --> 01:15:34,400
You drink and nothing
can defeat you.

547
01:15:45,086 --> 01:15:49,224
It's the best water I've ever tasted.

548
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:54,611
- Did you see the lady with the snake?
- Yes.

549
01:15:54,612 --> 01:15:57,310
She was doing the Cobra thing.
She was like...

550
01:15:57,364 --> 01:16:01,578
copying the snake. And it was like...
right here, and she was like...

551
01:16:03,249 --> 01:16:07,040
You did not watch closely enough,
Shao Dre.

552
01:16:07,206 --> 01:16:10,212
The snake was copying the woman.

553
01:16:10,442 --> 01:16:14,294
What? I don't get it.

554
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,490
Look.

555
01:16:24,491 --> 01:16:31,160
- What do you see?
- Me, well my reflection. - Yes.

556
01:16:32,897 --> 01:16:37,288
- Now, what do you see?
- It's blurry. - Yes.

557
01:16:37,289 --> 01:16:42,526
That woman was sliced through water
quiet and calm.

558
01:16:42,527 --> 01:16:45,357
In here and in here.

559
01:16:46,044 --> 01:16:52,064
So, the snake reflects her action,
like still water.

560
01:16:52,067 --> 01:16:54,677
- Like a mirror?
- Yes.

561
01:16:56,409 --> 01:17:00,146
So, she controlled a snake
by doing nothing?

562
01:17:02,288 --> 01:17:07,534
Being still and doing nothing,
are two very different things.

563
01:17:10,858 --> 01:17:14,355
- She used her Chi on that snake, didn't she?
- Very good.

564
01:17:14,356 --> 01:17:18,122
You gotta teach me that.
How to control people.

565
01:17:18,142 --> 01:17:22,699
There is only one person
you need to learn how to control.

566
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,310
Who?

567
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:32,555
Empty your mind.
Flow with my movement.

568
01:17:32,556 --> 01:17:35,536
Connect to the energy,
around you.

569
01:17:35,574 --> 01:17:40,487
- I kinda just want to learn the cobra thing.
- Cobra takes a lifetime.

570
01:17:40,488 --> 01:17:44,299
- Requires great focus.
- But I have great focus?!

571
01:17:47,766 --> 01:17:50,860
- Oh my God. Mr. Han...
- Your focus,

572
01:17:50,861 --> 01:17:55,103
- needs more focus.
- Mr. Han...

573
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:36,043
Thank you, Mr. Han.

574
01:18:56,899 --> 01:19:00,781
There's no such thing
as fortune cookies in China.

575
01:19:00,857 --> 01:19:03,440
Dre, please be careful
crossing the street.

576
01:19:03,452 --> 01:19:10,191
You just scared the life out of me,
the other day. They have the "right-of-way".

577
01:19:12,918 --> 01:19:15,407
And the symbols. I can't get
the symbols right on the bathrooms.

578
01:19:15,712 --> 01:19:18,404
And I'm still walkin' into the men's restroom.

579
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:21,404
The other day I walked in,
there was this 90 years old Chinese man,

580
01:19:21,405 --> 01:19:23,384
he thought he was getting a little treat.

581
01:19:23,385 --> 01:19:27,534
Dre, please stop that! You look crazy!
Here, eat your noodles!

582
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:53,917
Mr. Han,
what's goin' on?

583
01:19:55,793 --> 01:19:58,046
Anticipation.

584
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,383
I can't see...

585
01:20:00,391 --> 01:20:02,646
Don't see it, feel it.

586
01:20:02,828 --> 01:20:04,714
Dammit, Mr. Han!

587
01:20:05,108 --> 01:20:07,443
I felt that one!

588
01:20:10,133 --> 01:20:12,934
- Mr. Han.
- What?

589
01:20:18,148 --> 01:20:22,538
- Concentrate, okay?
- Okay. Do I get the stick now?

590
01:20:43,897 --> 01:20:47,038
- Dre, you okay?
- I'm okay.

591
01:20:50,729 --> 01:20:53,849
What's up Mr. Han, what time
we are trainin' tomorrow?

592
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:57,031
Shao Dre, we are not training tomorrow.

593
01:20:57,058 --> 01:20:58,656
Why not?

594
01:21:00,596 --> 01:21:02,993
- Wu chi pi fan
- Wu chi pi fan?

595
01:21:02,994 --> 01:21:06,373
It means: "Too much of something
is not good."

596
01:21:06,374 --> 01:21:08,998
You train a lot, you need to rest.

597
01:21:09,009 --> 01:21:13,710
A day off?
Yes, Mr. Han! Yes!

598
01:21:13,927 --> 01:21:17,337
Shao Dre needs to rest.
Yes, Mr. Han.

599
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:23,652
You rest, too.
I love you, Mr. Han. Peace!

600
01:21:40,376 --> 01:21:42,340
Are you okay?

601
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:47,000
- My audition is tomorrow at a six.
- Isn't it what you've been practicing for?

602
01:21:47,001 --> 01:21:51,967
- Yes, of course.
- Don't worry, you got it.

603
01:21:51,968 --> 01:21:55,166
What if they don't pick me?

604
01:21:57,378 --> 01:21:59,350
Meiying, wait!

605
01:22:00,742 --> 01:22:02,984
First of all,
I'm going to be there with you.

606
01:22:02,992 --> 01:22:07,331
And B, all you have to do is what your
teacher says. Play the pauses.

607
01:22:07,332 --> 01:22:09,707
It's easy, watch.

608
01:22:11,603 --> 01:22:13,409
You see?

609
01:22:14,792 --> 01:22:19,221
- I have to practice.
- Wait.

610
01:22:19,222 --> 01:22:20,751
Wu gi bi fan.

611
01:22:20,752 --> 01:22:21,851
What?

612
01:22:21,852 --> 01:22:23,849
I'm sorry,
I don't think you don't speak Chinese.

613
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:29,427
Wu gi bi fan.
Too much of good stuff is a bad stuff?

614
01:22:29,428 --> 01:22:31,745
Ow...Wu chi pi fan.

615
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:35,067
Yeah.
Wu gi bi FUN.

616
01:22:36,346 --> 01:22:38,781
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

617
01:22:38,878 --> 01:22:41,893
Have you ever been to the gym?
C'mon, we are going to have some fun.

618
01:22:42,431 --> 01:22:45,927
Come on, I know you want
to go have some fun!

619
01:23:13,773 --> 01:23:17,563
Okay, that's going to give you
some serious gas.

620
01:23:31,683 --> 01:23:34,675
- What do you see?
- Me.

621
01:23:35,104 --> 01:23:39,079
- Now, what do you see?
- Me.

622
01:24:09,026 --> 01:24:09,706
Go, come on.

623
01:24:09,707 --> 01:24:13,876
<i>You're dancing machine.
That was pretty good!<i/></i>

624
01:24:15,753 --> 01:24:19,807
<i>Here comes, round two.<i/></i>

625
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,720
<i>You're hot.<i/></i>

626
01:25:17,785 --> 01:25:22,941
-That's like American dancing.
Like, you should have a group. -No.

627
01:25:22,942 --> 01:25:28,925
With like, other people in it
dancing behind you, doin' the same stuff.

628
01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:44,347
- The audition, it was changed to today.
- But they said, it's tomorrow.

629
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:47,203
Something happened.
It is in 20 minutes.

630
01:25:47,227 --> 01:25:50,712
My father is coming to get me.

631
01:28:52,677 --> 01:28:57,063
Hey, she's like totally going to get it, right,
because that was just great.

632
01:29:31,266 --> 01:29:34,633
Hey! That was fantastic.

633
01:29:34,634 --> 01:29:38,477
That was... You just...
You played so beautifully, and...

634
01:29:39,464 --> 01:29:42,016
We can no longer be friends.

635
01:29:42,672 --> 01:29:46,225
You are bad for my life.

636
01:29:58,743 --> 01:30:01,738
See you at the tournament.

637
01:30:02,197 --> 01:30:05,447
Don't be late for that.

638
01:30:49,978 --> 01:30:52,602
Mr. Han!
Mr. Han!

639
01:30:58,039 --> 01:31:00,668
We'll not train today.

640
01:31:15,488 --> 01:31:21,525
- What are you doing?
- It's July 8th.

641
01:32:32,573 --> 01:32:35,785
Why did you wreck the car?

642
01:32:53,892 --> 01:32:57,171
His name was Kang Kang.

643
01:32:57,314 --> 01:33:01,082
Shao Dre, how old are you?

644
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:03,464
Twelve.

645
01:33:03,524 --> 01:33:06,352
He was ten.

646
01:33:07,454 --> 01:33:10,611
He was so beautiful.

647
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:16,471
Her name was Xiang.

648
01:33:17,067 --> 01:33:20,717
She was a singer.

649
01:33:22,855 --> 01:33:26,337
Not professional.

650
01:33:27,423 --> 01:33:30,775
She sang only for me.

651
01:34:07,973 --> 01:34:10,595
What happened?

652
01:34:18,351 --> 01:34:21,466
There was a steep hill.

653
01:34:21,574 --> 01:34:24,607
Lots of rain.

654
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:29,717
The car, it just...

655
01:34:30,345 --> 01:34:33,441
I was driving.

656
01:34:33,442 --> 01:34:36,977
We argued about something.

657
01:34:38,246 --> 01:34:40,378
I was so angry.

658
01:34:40,764 --> 01:34:43,223
I lost control.

659
01:34:43,633 --> 01:34:47,288
I try to remember...

660
01:34:47,289 --> 01:34:50,608
but I can not remember what we're
argued about.

661
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:55,253
I hope it was something important.

662
01:34:58,272 --> 01:35:02,885
Every year, I fix the car.

663
01:35:03,693 --> 01:35:07,681
But still fix nothing.

664
01:39:57,284 --> 01:39:59,603
Mr. Han!

665
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:57,013
Win or lose, doesn't matter.
Fight hard.

666
01:41:57,889 --> 01:42:01,905
Earn respect.
The boys leave you alone.

667
01:42:05,515 --> 01:42:08,547
I have a present for you.

668
01:42:13,657 --> 01:42:15,460
Oh! Mr. Han.

669
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:19,217
This is the one Bruce Lee had.

670
01:42:19,239 --> 01:42:21,370
Great.

671
01:42:21,597 --> 01:42:24,097
Thank you.

672
01:42:26,864 --> 01:42:31,125
You have taught me
a very important lesson, Shao Dre.

673
01:42:32,314 --> 01:42:41,050
Life will knock us down, but we can
choose, whether or not,  to get back up.

674
01:42:43,137 --> 01:42:47,107
You're the best friend
I've ever had, Mr. Han.

675
01:43:03,838 --> 01:43:07,074
Okay.

676
01:43:09,598 --> 01:43:13,383
Wait!
Can you help me with something?

677
01:43:17,759 --> 01:43:19,399
Dre?

678
01:43:19,489 --> 01:43:23,260
Is your dad home?

679
01:43:26,714 --> 01:43:27,960
Sir...

680
01:43:28,766 --> 01:43:31,586
My name is Dre Parker.

681
01:43:31,596 --> 01:43:39,160
My actions have brought
dishonor to your family.

682
01:43:39,161 --> 01:43:44,280
Your daughter has been
a great friend to me.

683
01:43:44,281 --> 01:43:47,452
And from her I have learned...

684
01:43:47,965 --> 01:43:50,306
...that a true friend...

685
01:43:50,311 --> 01:43:53,524
...is a person
who makes your life better.

686
01:43:53,572 --> 01:43:58,550
But, if you give me a second chance...

687
01:43:58,632 --> 01:44:02,437
...I promise that I will be...

688
01:44:02,438 --> 01:44:10,380
...the best friend your
daughter has ever had.

689
01:44:13,365 --> 01:44:16,356
That's it.

690
01:44:30,707 --> 01:44:36,474
My daughter told me that she made
a promise to be at your tournament.

691
01:44:36,515 --> 01:44:41,063
In our family,
we do not break our promises.

692
01:44:44,214 --> 01:44:46,194
Good luck!

693
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:49,949
Thank you.

694
01:44:57,059 --> 01:44:59,692
Rock and roll.

695
01:45:23,646 --> 01:45:27,712
Let the tournament begin!

696
01:46:00,139 --> 01:46:02,820
Shao Dre, you're up.

697
01:46:04,410 --> 01:46:06,831
- What's that?
- The rule book.

698
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:10,941
- You don't know the rules?
- Of course I know the rules, it's simple.

699
01:46:10,942 --> 01:46:13,272
You hit him,
and don't let him hit you.

700
01:46:13,315 --> 01:46:15,054
What?

701
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:17,855
Mr. Han, they're going to kill me.

702
01:46:19,443 --> 01:46:25,878
Two points to win. Win it two times.
Go. Focus. Focus.

703
01:46:55,512 --> 01:46:57,734
That's a warning.
You cannot run off the mat.

704
01:46:57,743 --> 01:47:00,841
Next time you lose a point.
Go.

705
01:47:00,842 --> 01:47:04,262
- Be strong.
- Come on, Dre.

706
01:47:38,613 --> 01:47:42,053
- Good job. Next time, no face.
- I'm sorry, I can't help it.

707
01:47:42,054 --> 01:47:44,323
The next point winner.

708
01:47:44,324 --> 01:47:46,482
Come on, baby.

709
01:50:34,073 --> 01:50:38,582
Dre Parker advances to the semi-finals!

710
01:50:39,152 --> 01:50:43,163
From now on, the semi-final matches,
three points to win.

711
01:50:43,164 --> 01:50:45,128
Be kinda hot if I
won this thing, huh, Mr. Han?

712
01:50:45,166 --> 01:50:50,613
- Be kinda hot if you focused.
- Yeah, well, after that.

713
01:50:58,616 --> 01:51:03,473
<i>And now the 1st semi-final
of the evening.</i>

714
01:51:03,474 --> 01:51:05,038
TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS
SEMI-FINAL

715
01:51:05,586 --> 01:51:07,702
First round:
Cheng Vs. Wu Ping.

716
01:52:45,872 --> 01:52:49,467
Cheng advances to final.

717
01:53:02,279 --> 01:53:06,937
Next semi-final:
Introducing Fighting Dragon Liang...

718
01:53:08,323 --> 01:53:13,265
...and the surprising finalist, Dre Parker.

719
01:53:20,829 --> 01:53:24,558
Empty your mind. Focus.

720
01:54:22,262 --> 01:54:25,782
You're disqualified!

721
01:54:31,911 --> 01:54:34,425
Are you okay?

722
01:54:49,698 --> 01:54:52,591
He's done.

723
01:54:52,592 --> 01:54:58,635
I'm sorry, you should not continue.
You've brought honor to your family.

724
01:55:00,181 --> 01:55:04,532
The doctor says, you did great.

725
01:55:13,671 --> 01:55:18,310
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

726
01:55:19,995 --> 01:55:23,302
Dre Parker has 2 minutes to
return to the match.

727
01:55:23,303 --> 01:55:26,128
If he's unable to return...

728
01:55:26,129 --> 01:55:30,880
...the Fighting Dragons
win by default.

729
01:55:32,137 --> 01:55:34,922
Can you guys give us a second?

730
01:55:35,779 --> 01:55:41,609
Yeah, okay. Sure baby,
whatever you need.

731
01:55:48,688 --> 01:55:51,721
Do you think I could have won?

732
01:55:52,028 --> 01:55:55,103
Win or lose doesn't matter,
Shao Dre.

733
01:55:55,843 --> 01:55:58,712
You know that's not what I mean.

734
01:56:02,133 --> 01:56:07,624
Yes, I think you had a good chance.

735
01:56:09,453 --> 01:56:13,029
So, let's do the fiery cup thing.

736
01:56:15,034 --> 01:56:20,258
You don't need to fight anymore.
You have proven everything you need to prove.

737
01:56:20,259 --> 01:56:23,814
What, that I can get
beat up easy, and then quit?

738
01:56:23,815 --> 01:56:26,832
That's not balance,
that's not real Kung Fu.

739
01:56:26,950 --> 01:56:32,979
You said, when life knocks you down,
you could choose whether or not to get back up.

740
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:37,333
Well, I'm tryin' to get back up.
And why won't you help me?

741
01:56:39,590 --> 01:56:41,317
Because...

742
01:56:41,365 --> 01:56:45,709
I cannot watch you
get hurt anymore.

743
01:56:48,339 --> 01:56:52,985
Please, Mr. Han. Please.

744
01:56:53,739 --> 01:57:00,432
Just tell me, Shao Dre. Why?
Why you need to go back out there so badly?

745
01:57:01,804 --> 01:57:05,616
Because I'm still scared.

746
01:57:08,249 --> 01:57:12,908
No matter what happens tonight
when I leave...

747
01:57:13,107 --> 01:57:16,468
...I don't want to be scared anymore.

748
01:57:27,618 --> 01:57:34,117
Since Dre Parker has
not returned to the ring...

749
01:57:52,596 --> 01:57:57,299
Dre Parker will fight!

750
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:51,192
Shao Dre?

751
02:00:07,396 --> 02:00:10,634
Come on, Dre.
You can do this, Dre.

752
02:01:49,252 --> 02:01:52,683
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

753
02:01:55,206 --> 02:01:58,910
No mercy.

754
02:03:07,097 --> 02:03:12,470
The score is tied.
The next point wins!

755
02:06:03,050 --> 02:06:07,127
I'm so proud of you.

756
02:00:59,902 --> 02:01:20,902
