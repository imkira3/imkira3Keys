3
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:21,955
They're late.

4
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:41,432
Brenda,
we're coming up behind.

5
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:42,766
Keep 'em busy.

6
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:43,769
Hang on!

7
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:56,382
Call it in!

8
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,515
Transport zero-one-niner,

9
00:02:58,517 --> 00:02:59,884
we got trouble
on the rail line.

10
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:02,719
<i>Mile 23, send backup!
Send backup!</i>

11
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:04,690
<i>Roger that. On our way.</i>

12
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:21,507
This is crazy, Thomas!

13
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:26,480
Whoa!

14
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:31,985
Hang on.

15
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,664
Get me closer!

16
00:03:58,545 --> 00:03:59,745
Come on, Vince!

17
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:10,724
Vince!

18
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,098
Jump!

19
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:33,580
Shit!

20
00:04:33,946 --> 00:04:35,081
Let's go!

21
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:38,184
Hey! Berg!

22
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:45,857
Zero-one-niner,
be advised.

23
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,690
You've taken on boarders
at the rear.

24
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:49,829
We're engaging the truck now.

25
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,798
Hey, Brenda, you got company!

26
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,932
Go, go, go!

27
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:57,203
Open fire.

28
00:04:58,905 --> 00:04:59,905
Watch out!

29
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:02,908
Holy shit!

30
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:13,687
Thomas, you're on your own.
Don't die.

31
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:16,523
Good luck!

32
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:19,091
We gotta move. Come on!

33
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,716
Go, go! You heard him!

34
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:51,658
Give me the bag!

35
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:04,870
Shoot!

36
00:06:07,006 --> 00:06:08,307
Get down! Get down!

37
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,042
Vince?

38
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,711
We're set! Cover your ass!

39
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:16,081
Go, go, go!

40
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,552
Take cover!

41
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:20,912
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

42
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,136
We lost the rear five.
Stop the train!

43
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:56,553
Newt!

44
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:58,357
All right, come on,
let's go. Come on!

45
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:06,199
Minho!

46
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:10,870
Minho, can you hear me?

47
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,178
This one. This one!

48
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:26,018
Oh, shit!

49
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:28,722
It's gonna be close.

50
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:41,966
Hello!

51
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:45,738
Squirrelly bastard.

52
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,977
We got 'em! We got 'em!

53
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,360
<i>Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up.</i>

54
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:13,332
Let's go, boys.

55
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:25,078
Stop right there. Don't move.

56
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,683
I said freeze, asshole!

57
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:33,218
Whatever you say, <i>hermano.</i>

58
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:39,759
Hold him back!

59
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,362
Y'all don't wanna do that now.

60
00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:45,897
Hey, Fry.

61
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,801
Good to see you guys.
Go on, back up.

62
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:50,302
Uh-uh-uh!

63
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:54,406
Hi.

64
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:06,716
Newt, how you doing?

65
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:08,088
Don't rush me.

66
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:15,895
Shit!

67
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,299
Newt, get up here.

68
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:23,368
Almost there.

69
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:34,510
Newt, go!

70
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:41,888
- Where the hell are they?
- I don't know!

71
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,525
Go! There's too many of them!

72
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:00,807
All right, boys, we're here!

73
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:08,414
Keep moving!

74
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:14,220
- Come on!
- Lower!

75
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,161
Cover me!

76
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:29,899
Go, go!

77
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:31,467
All right, we're clear!

78
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:32,905
Okay, we're going up.

79
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:37,142
Vince, get up here!

80
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:42,415
Now, Vince!

81
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:00,900
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

82
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:05,939
We're going home, baby!

83
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:08,806
Yeah!

84
00:11:08,808 --> 00:11:10,410
All right, guys!
Good job. Whoo!

85
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:15,280
Yeah!

86
00:11:42,474 --> 00:11:43,807
Aris.

87
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:45,975
Hey, you guys okay?

88
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:47,179
Yeah, we're fine.

89
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:49,248
Jesus.

90
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:54,351
There you are. Oh, God!

91
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:57,153
It's okay. You guys are safe.
All right? Just hang on.

92
00:11:57,155 --> 00:11:58,435
I need
the bolt cutters.

93
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:05,762
Are you okay?

94
00:12:05,764 --> 00:12:07,333
I'm fine. How are you?

95
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:13,673
He's not here.

96
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:25,783
I'll take one.

97
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:28,317
Come on down.
You're safe here.

98
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:30,086
Need medical attention,
move to your left.

99
00:12:30,088 --> 00:12:31,355
I need first aid.

100
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:33,056
Right this way, guys.
Come on down here.

101
00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:34,258
Come on in, guys!

102
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,295
Okay, guys, over here!

103
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:38,932
All right, listen up.

104
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:42,468
I know you've all
been through hell.

105
00:12:43,835 --> 00:12:46,138
I wish I could say
our troubles are over.

106
00:12:47,372 --> 00:12:49,107
But we're not
through this yet.

107
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:54,213
WICKED's still out there.
They're not giving up.

108
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:59,381
'Cause you got
something they want.

109
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:01,552
They took you
because you're immune

110
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:05,254
to a plague that's wiping
out the human race.

111
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:08,460
And they think you're worth
sacrificing to find a cure.

112
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:11,063
Well, I don't.

113
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:14,030
So in two days,

114
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:16,767
when we get this tub
of rust seaworthy,

115
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,501
we're getting
the hell outta here.

116
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:19,370
We're gonna go to a place

117
00:13:19,372 --> 00:13:21,572
where WICKED
will never find you.

118
00:13:21,574 --> 00:13:23,874
A place you can start over.

119
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:25,477
A place you can call home.

120
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:28,544
- Are you with me?
- t

121
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:29,645
Come on.

122
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:31,282
Come on
up here. Let's get to work.

123
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:32,749
Come on,
I need some volunteers.

124
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:34,150
Let's go.

125
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:36,019
Let's get to work.

126
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:39,690
Let's get these crates
on the boat.

127
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:42,493
We got two days
before we leave.

128
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:44,764
All right.
Give me a hand up here.

129
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:53,570
May I help you?

130
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:55,505
It looks good.

131
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:57,273
How you feeling?

132
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,408
Awesome.

133
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,408
I was just asking.

134
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,110
I know, I know,
you're just asking.

135
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:02,614
Everybody's just asking.

136
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:05,816
Don't worry.
When I Crank out,

137
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:08,085
you'll be the first
to know, okay?

138
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:14,560
Here, drink this.

139
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:23,403
Took you guys
long enough to rescue us.

140
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:26,071
It's good to see
you, too, bud.

141
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:30,474
So what happened?

142
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:32,174
I fought back.

143
00:14:32,176 --> 00:14:33,712
Tried to, anyway.

144
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:36,746
You're lucky
you found us at all.

145
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:38,648
They had us
on the move a lot.

146
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,351
It felt like something
big was happening.

147
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:43,256
Any idea where
they were heading?

148
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:47,158
All I know is

149
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,062
they kept talking
about a city.

150
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:55,865
I didn't think
there were any cities left.

151
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,270
That's because
there aren't.

152
00:14:58,136 --> 00:14:59,805
Not still standing, anyway.

153
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,273
Okay, wait. What about Minho?

154
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:05,811
Why wasn't he on the train?

155
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:14,187
I'm sorry, Thomas.

156
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:18,524
He was.

157
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:25,562
They got 40,
maybe 50 kids.

158
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:27,163
We're still compiling
an official count,

159
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:28,298
but the pilot
got a good look.

160
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,633
He thinks it was them.

161
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:31,134
Of course it was them.

162
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:32,936
What about the Berg?

163
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:34,137
We tracked it a few miles.

164
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,437
But someone must have
known about the locator.

165
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:36,807
They're totally off the grid.

166
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,144
Move it, Immunes.

167
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:40,879
<i>C22.</i>

168
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:45,115
<i>B9.</i>

169
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:46,283
We're searching the area,

170
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:49,686
but they're probably
long gone by now.

171
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:51,756
Oh, no, they're not
going anywhere.

172
00:15:55,394 --> 00:15:57,463
He didn't get
what he really wanted.

173
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:03,569
There, that's it.

174
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:05,804
It's a few hundred miles.

175
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:07,803
Based on the railways,

176
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:08,739
everything that Aris
told us,

177
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:10,506
that's gotta be
where they're headed.

178
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:12,975
That's where
they're taking Minho.

179
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,144
We take everyone
who can fight.

180
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,147
Follow the roads
where we can.

181
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:19,416
We can make it back
within a week.

182
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:20,486
A week?

183
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:23,622
It took us six months
to get here.

184
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:27,224
We got over
100 kids here now.

185
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:29,058
We can't just hang out
here forever

186
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,927
after what we
just pulled.

187
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:32,361
You wanna wander off

188
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:33,897
to some random point
on the map.

189
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,164
You don't even know
what's there.

190
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,701
I do.

191
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:39,338
It's been a few years,

192
00:16:40,673 --> 00:16:41,841
but I've been there.

193
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,278
The Last City.

194
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:48,512
That's what WICKED called it.

195
00:16:48,514 --> 00:16:50,716
It was their whole
base of operations.

196
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:55,217
If that city
is still standing,

197
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:57,589
that's the last place
you wanna go, <i>hermano.</i>

198
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:00,926
That's the lion's den.

199
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:03,661
It's nothing we haven't
done before.

200
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:05,229
Yeah, with months
of planning,

201
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:08,263
and reliable information,
the element of surprise,

202
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:09,465
none of which we have now.

203
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:10,834
Vince, I've
thought this through.

204
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:11,734
Would you just
hear me out?

205
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:13,103
The last time we
went off half-cocked...

206
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:14,738
I lost everything.

207
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,907
You remember that?

208
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:23,579
Look, I know
it's Minho. All right?

209
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:25,449
But you can't ask me
to put those kids

210
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:26,953
on the line for one man.

211
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:30,590
I won't do it.

212
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:35,892
<i>Searching the grid now.</i>

213
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:39,762
<i>A is completed.</i>

214
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:41,766
<i>Scanning B-sector now.</i>

215
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:44,801
Shit. Hit the lights.

216
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:45,937
Let's go, let's go!

217
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:07,260
Jeez,
they're getting close.

218
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:11,731
You're right.

219
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:13,965
We can't stay here.

220
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:55,574
Where do you think
you're going then?

221
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:01,176
Newt...

222
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:02,447
Don't be a twat about it.

223
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:04,883
I'm already in.

224
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,416
Come on.

225
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:10,287
No. No, not this time.

226
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,387
Look,

227
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:12,588
even if we find Minho,

228
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,892
there's no guarantee
we make it back from this.

229
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:17,630
Well, you'll need all the help
you can get then, won't you?

230
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:27,237
Well, we started this
together.

231
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:29,842
May as well
end it that way, too.

232
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,511
Okay.

233
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:36,715
Let's go get him back.

234
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:21,394
No.

235
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:23,054
Hey!

236
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:32,697
Hey!

237
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:35,766
Hey! No, no, no.
Wait. Hey!

238
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:38,804
Hey, wait, wait!
Hey, it's okay! Hey!

239
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:19,241
<i>How's he doing?</i>

240
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:21,083
<i>Breathing levels look strong.</i>

241
00:22:32,424 --> 00:22:33,925
Oh, shit!

242
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:29,280
No! No!

243
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:58,540
<i>It's not as effective
as the maze,</i>

244
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:00,676
<i>but it seems to be working.</i>

245
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:02,679
It's promising.

246
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:05,384
But we'll need a larger sample
to work with.

247
00:24:06,717 --> 00:24:08,653
<i>All right.</i>

248
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:10,755
<i>Carry on.</i>

249
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:33,308
<i>No! No!</i>

250
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:42,715
You want us to go in there?

251
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:50,752
I don't wanna come across
as too negative,

252
00:25:50,754 --> 00:25:51,820
but if I was a Crank,

253
00:25:51,822 --> 00:25:54,158
that's exactly
where I would be.

254
00:25:55,926 --> 00:25:58,396
I don't think we have
much of a choice.

255
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:09,141
All right. I get shotgun.

256
00:26:28,393 --> 00:26:29,928
Well, here we go.

257
00:26:34,165 --> 00:26:36,367
Yeah, just take it
nice and slow.

258
00:26:44,442 --> 00:26:46,511
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

259
00:26:56,954 --> 00:27:00,122
It's okay. It's just one,

260
00:27:00,124 --> 00:27:02,692
so take it slow,
go around him.

261
00:27:02,694 --> 00:27:04,461
We'll be fine.

262
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:05,830
Take it slow.

263
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:08,199
Take it slow.

264
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:18,242
Please.

265
00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:19,875
Please.

266
00:27:24,382 --> 00:27:25,584
Help me.

267
00:27:26,484 --> 00:27:28,017
Please.

268
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:30,185
Please! Let me in.

269
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:32,788
- Okay. Fry, we gotta go.
- Please! Open the door.

270
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,390
- You need to go right now!
- Why won't you open it?

271
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:35,724
Just floor it, Fry!

272
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:37,261
- Hold on!
- Floor it! Come on!

273
00:27:43,335 --> 00:27:44,336
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

274
00:27:48,673 --> 00:27:50,943
- Come on, Fry, shake him!
- I'm trying!

275
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:55,079
Go.

276
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:01,553
Hang on!

277
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:04,455
Oh, God.

278
00:28:05,923 --> 00:28:07,425
Frypan, watch out!

279
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:20,505
Everyone okay?

280
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:22,540
My hand.

281
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:25,944
My hand.

282
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:30,381
Fry, cover your eyes.

283
00:28:33,117 --> 00:28:35,084
Oh, shit. You okay, man?

284
00:28:35,086 --> 00:28:37,189
- Yeah. You all right?
- Shit, my hand.

285
00:28:38,022 --> 00:28:40,157
Wait! Thomas!

286
00:28:43,395 --> 00:28:44,861
Thomas, the door!

287
00:28:44,863 --> 00:28:46,899
Can you get out?

288
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:53,368
Oh, shit. All right.

289
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,770
- Newt, you all right?
- Fry, go around.

290
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:57,309
I'm trying to get out.

291
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:03,479
Newt, you okay?

292
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:05,147
Yeah, I think so.

293
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:07,218
Fry, you good?

294
00:29:11,223 --> 00:29:12,855
Oh, shit.

295
00:29:12,857 --> 00:29:14,123
Frypan, I think
we gotta move.

296
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,327
- Now!
- Wait a minute!

297
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:18,493
- Right now!
- Fry, now!

298
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:20,496
Come on, what are you doing?
We gotta move! Come on!

299
00:29:20,498 --> 00:29:22,999
- Come on!
- Hold on!

300
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:24,567
- Frypan gotta go! Come on!
- Wait!

301
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:25,604
Come on!

302
00:29:29,706 --> 00:29:31,473
- Nice shot, Fry.
- Thanks.

303
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,612
Okay. We gotta go.

304
00:29:36,614 --> 00:29:38,417
Go, go!

305
00:29:39,517 --> 00:29:41,219
Fry, come on, let's go!

306
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,423
- Fry, let's move, let's go!
- Go! Go! Go!

307
00:29:48,926 --> 00:29:50,361
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

308
00:29:53,496 --> 00:29:55,064
Watch out.

309
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:56,932
- Fry, you got any left?
- Yeah!

310
00:29:56,934 --> 00:29:58,502
Okay. This way, this way!

311
00:29:59,937 --> 00:30:01,505
Okay, Fry.
Other way, other way!

312
00:30:04,308 --> 00:30:05,309
I'm out!

313
00:30:07,611 --> 00:30:08,679
Shit!

314
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:19,056
Hey, get in!

315
00:30:23,728 --> 00:30:25,795
- Go, Jorge, go!
- Go!

316
00:30:25,797 --> 00:30:26,999
Hang on!

317
00:30:43,581 --> 00:30:45,314
I'm impressed!

318
00:30:45,316 --> 00:30:47,319
You guys almost lasted
a whole day.

319
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,756
- You good?
- Yeah.

320
00:30:57,428 --> 00:31:00,197
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna
bring you guys into this.

321
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:03,900
I think what
he's trying to say

322
00:31:03,902 --> 00:31:05,504
is thanks for saving us.

323
00:31:06,838 --> 00:31:08,538
You're welcome.

324
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,373
Hey,
don't get your hopes up.

325
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:11,440
That checkpoint back there,

326
00:31:11,442 --> 00:31:12,842
that was the city's
last defense.

327
00:31:12,844 --> 00:31:16,248
If that was overrun,
chances are the city is, too.

328
00:31:17,882 --> 00:31:19,147
Yeah, unless they figured out

329
00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:21,419
some other way
to keep the Cranks out.

330
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:47,576
Funny...

331
00:31:47,578 --> 00:31:49,011
Spent three years
trapped behind walls,

332
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:50,144
trying to break out,

333
00:31:50,146 --> 00:31:52,483
and now we wanna
break back in.

334
00:31:53,283 --> 00:31:55,684
Yeah. It's hilarious.

335
00:31:55,686 --> 00:31:57,086
Jorge, how do we get in?

336
00:31:57,088 --> 00:31:58,820
Don't look at me, <i>hermano.</i>

337
00:31:58,822 --> 00:32:00,722
Those walls are new.

338
00:32:00,724 --> 00:32:03,528
I guess that's WICKED's
answer for everything.

339
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:08,666
Well, we ain't gonna
figure it out from up here.

340
00:32:09,768 --> 00:32:11,203
Let's go!

341
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:25,117
You really think
he's in there?

342
00:32:27,117 --> 00:32:28,854
I guess we'll find out.

343
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:33,158
You know she's
gonna be there, too.

344
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,121
We just have to make sure
we have the resources.

345
00:33:05,123 --> 00:33:08,326
And I'll keep in touch.
Excuse me.

346
00:33:11,262 --> 00:33:12,797
Are you ready?

347
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:14,931
It'll be fine.

348
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:17,732
<i>People are beginning
to lose faith, Doctor.</i>

349
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:20,236
When you sealed off the walls,
you assured us

350
00:33:20,238 --> 00:33:23,372
that it would only be
a temporary precaution.

351
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:25,507
Why have you now
denied all entry?

352
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:29,845
Because things are changing.
And not for the better.

353
00:33:29,847 --> 00:33:32,651
Infection rates were up 300%.

354
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:34,517
Fortunately,

355
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:37,322
we may be on the verge
of a breakthrough.

356
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:42,423
This is Subject A7.

357
00:33:42,425 --> 00:33:46,362
He spent over three years
in the Maze Trials.

358
00:33:46,364 --> 00:33:49,731
The antibodies
produced in response

359
00:33:49,733 --> 00:33:52,601
have been the strongest
we've ever seen.

360
00:33:52,603 --> 00:33:55,938
We're extracting
a new serum as we speak.

361
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,274
And with your support,

362
00:33:58,276 --> 00:34:00,478
we'd like to begin
human trials.

363
00:34:01,578 --> 00:34:05,147
Thank you, Doctor.
That is very impressive.

364
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:06,917
But we have been
down this road before.

365
00:34:08,452 --> 00:34:11,720
Frankly, we are all beginning
to wonder if...

366
00:34:11,722 --> 00:34:14,957
If our resources couldn't be
better spent elsewhere.

367
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:16,691
- Meaning?
- Safe zones.

368
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:19,127
Protected areas
like the one we're in.

369
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:21,830
We could save
as many people as possible.

370
00:34:21,832 --> 00:34:23,267
How many?

371
00:34:26,336 --> 00:34:27,705
A thousand?

372
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,839
Two thousand?

373
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:33,209
And that's assuming
your protected areas

374
00:34:33,211 --> 00:34:35,144
stay protected,

375
00:34:35,146 --> 00:34:36,814
which we know they won't.

376
00:34:38,482 --> 00:34:41,649
The infected already outnumber
the healthy three-to-one.

377
00:34:41,651 --> 00:34:46,288
All you'd be doing
is delaying the inevitable.

378
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,660
Have any of you ever lost
someone to the virus?

379
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:52,897
A niece.

380
00:34:53,897 --> 00:34:54,899
Anna.

381
00:34:57,102 --> 00:34:59,870
I'm sorry we weren't
able to help her.

382
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:05,376
But imagine if we were able
to live with the virus.

383
00:35:07,044 --> 00:35:09,345
To survive it.

384
00:35:09,347 --> 00:35:11,546
Imagine being able
to tell Anna

385
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:15,286
that you could give her the
chance to live a normal life.

386
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:19,390
We've never been
this close to a cure.

387
00:35:20,723 --> 00:35:24,763
And we've sacrificed a lot
to get this far.

388
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:27,498
Please,

389
00:35:28,832 --> 00:35:31,603
don't let those sacrifices
be for nothing.

390
00:35:45,048 --> 00:35:46,582
Nicely done.

391
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:50,488
They can be a tough crowd.
You handled them perfectly.

392
00:35:53,423 --> 00:35:56,357
"Delaying the inevitable."

393
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,497
Thomas used to say
the same about us.

394
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:03,368
Do you still think about him?

395
00:36:05,435 --> 00:36:08,337
I can help you with that,
those memories.

396
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,372
There's no reason
to keep holding on to them.

397
00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:12,040
It's a simple procedure.

398
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:13,778
There is a reason.

399
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,950
I want to remember.

400
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:22,450
If we find a cure,

401
00:36:22,452 --> 00:36:25,356
that's the only way all this
was worth it.

402
00:36:30,461 --> 00:36:32,897
I hope you're right.

403
00:36:53,618 --> 00:36:55,250
This place has really
gone through hell.

404
00:36:55,252 --> 00:36:56,584
We just gotta stay together.

405
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:57,953
<i>We are the voice</i>

406
00:36:57,955 --> 00:36:59,721
<i>of the voiceless!</i>

407
00:36:59,723 --> 00:37:02,524
<i>They hide
behind their walls,</i>

408
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:05,526
<i>thinking they can keep
the cure for themselves,</i>

409
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:10,366
<i>while they watch the rest
of us wither and rot!</i>

410
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:12,366
<i>But there are more of us</i>

411
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:13,836
<i>than there are of them.</i>

412
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:15,303
<i>And I say,</i>

413
00:37:15,305 --> 00:37:17,171
<i>we rise up</i>

414
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:20,341
<i>and take back what is ours!</i>

415
00:37:20,343 --> 00:37:23,481
<i>Let's bring back a victory!</i>

416
00:37:39,763 --> 00:37:41,064
Get Janson.

417
00:37:55,847 --> 00:37:56,778
Let us in!

418
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,848
That's it. That's our way in.

419
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,415
Let us in!

420
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:02,785
To the wall!

421
00:38:02,787 --> 00:38:08,193
Let us in!
Let us in! Let us in!

422
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:09,959
Thomas!

423
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:11,826
This is not
what you're looking for.

424
00:38:11,828 --> 00:38:13,562
All these people
trying to find their way in,

425
00:38:13,564 --> 00:38:15,531
you think you're gonna
find something they can't?

426
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:17,868
Came this far.
I'm not turning back now.

427
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:23,907
What the hell
did we get ourselves into?

428
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:35,586
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

429
00:38:37,888 --> 00:38:40,691
Thomas, this
doesn't feel right.

430
00:38:41,658 --> 00:38:43,158
You were right, sir.

431
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,231
The drone sweep picked him up
outside the walls.

432
00:38:48,265 --> 00:38:50,201
Get the guns online.

433
00:39:20,964 --> 00:39:23,600
Hey, guys, we gotta go now.
Look.

434
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:50,825
Let's go, let's go!

435
00:39:50,827 --> 00:39:52,528
- Thomas, let's go.
- We gotta get out of here!

436
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,095
Let's go! Let's go!

437
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:56,900
Go! Go! Go! Come on!

438
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,336
Go! Keep going!

439
00:40:00,403 --> 00:40:01,606
Come on!

440
00:40:04,142 --> 00:40:05,577
Move!

441
00:40:15,185 --> 00:40:18,453
Come on! Get in! Get in!

442
00:40:18,455 --> 00:40:20,091
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

443
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:23,959
Come on!

444
00:40:23,961 --> 00:40:25,729
- No way out!
- Come on!

445
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,428
Newt! Newt!

446
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,633
Get your hands
off of me!

447
00:40:31,935 --> 00:40:33,535
No! Brenda!

448
00:40:33,537 --> 00:40:35,138
Brenda! Brenda!

449
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:40,075
Go, go, go!

450
00:40:40,077 --> 00:40:41,778
Get off me!
Get off me!

451
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,555
Send out a patrol.

452
00:40:52,557 --> 00:40:55,193
Tell them not to come back
until he's found.

453
00:41:13,577 --> 00:41:14,911
Let's go!

454
00:41:29,593 --> 00:41:31,095
Get out!

455
00:41:42,272 --> 00:41:43,274
Where you going?

456
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:46,241
Where is she,
you son of a bitch?

457
00:41:46,243 --> 00:41:47,308
Hey! Hey! Hey!

458
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,977
Shit! Hey! Wait!

459
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:50,212
Come on,
come on, come on.

460
00:41:50,214 --> 00:41:51,345
I'm right here.
I'm right here!

461
00:41:51,347 --> 00:41:53,149
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right. Okay.

462
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,482
I'm right here.
I'm right here!

463
00:41:54,484 --> 00:41:55,616
Oh, Brenda.

464
00:41:55,618 --> 00:41:56,685
Everybody relax.

465
00:41:56,687 --> 00:41:58,453
We're all on
the same side here.

466
00:41:58,455 --> 00:42:01,325
What do you mean same side?
Who the hell are you?

467
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:14,304
Hey, Greenie.

468
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:19,810
Gally?

469
00:42:22,713 --> 00:42:24,182
No way.

470
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:30,651
No, wait!

471
00:42:30,653 --> 00:42:32,386
Hold!

472
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:33,721
Stop! It's all right!

473
00:42:33,723 --> 00:42:35,792
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop! Stop it!

474
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:37,491
Stop.

475
00:42:38,729 --> 00:42:41,029
- He killed Chuck.
- Yeah, I know.

476
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:42,997
I remember.
I was there too, all right?

477
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:45,267
But I also remember
that he was stung

478
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:47,071
and half out of his mind.

479
00:42:49,705 --> 00:42:52,374
Just calm down. All right?

480
00:42:52,376 --> 00:42:53,444
Come on.

481
00:43:03,921 --> 00:43:06,022
Kind of had that coming.

482
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,758
Anybody else? Fry? Newt?

483
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,129
Do you know this guy?

484
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:15,266
He was an old friend.

485
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:18,500
How?

486
00:43:18,502 --> 00:43:20,203
How is this possible?

487
00:43:20,937 --> 00:43:22,803
We watched you die.

488
00:43:22,805 --> 00:43:25,707
No, you left me to die.

489
00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:27,676
And if we hadn't found you
when we did,

490
00:43:27,678 --> 00:43:28,946
you'd be dead right now.

491
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:34,151
What the hell
are you doing here?

492
00:43:35,651 --> 00:43:37,352
Minho.

493
00:43:37,354 --> 00:43:39,654
WICKED has him here.

494
00:43:39,656 --> 00:43:41,993
We're looking for a way in.

495
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:46,397
I can help with that.

496
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:50,866
Follow me.

497
00:43:50,868 --> 00:43:53,070
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

498
00:43:54,705 --> 00:43:56,107
Suit yourself.

499
00:43:57,073 --> 00:43:59,409
But I can get you
through those walls.

500
00:44:07,283 --> 00:44:09,517
After the maze,
I got picked up by a group

501
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:11,285
headed to the city.

502
00:44:11,287 --> 00:44:14,156
They realized I was immune,
patched me up,

503
00:44:14,158 --> 00:44:16,527
and they brought me here
to Lawrence.

504
00:44:17,727 --> 00:44:19,194
This group's been at war
with WICKED

505
00:44:19,196 --> 00:44:21,830
ever since they took control
of the city.

506
00:44:21,832 --> 00:44:25,399
But WICKED can't hide behind
those walls forever.

507
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:26,968
Day's gonna come,
and they're gonna pay

508
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:28,606
for what they've done.

509
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:34,979
Listen, uh,

510
00:44:35,812 --> 00:44:37,845
he doesn't get
a lot of visitors.

511
00:44:37,847 --> 00:44:41,051
So, let me do the talking.
All right?

512
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:43,955
And try not to stare.

513
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:50,058
Rose took my nose,
I suppose.

514
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,160
Rose took my nose, I suppose.

515
00:44:52,162 --> 00:44:54,966
Suppose, suppose,
took my nose...

516
00:44:55,533 --> 00:44:56,934
I suppose.

517
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:02,272
Gally,

518
00:45:03,106 --> 00:45:04,872
glad to see you made it back.

519
00:45:04,874 --> 00:45:06,943
Jasper told me what happened.

520
00:45:07,676 --> 00:45:09,178
It was a slaughter.

521
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,448
There's nothing we could do
against those guns.

522
00:45:12,415 --> 00:45:14,183
No,

523
00:45:14,185 --> 00:45:17,118
but they can only poke
the hornet's nest so long

524
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,986
before they get stung.

525
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:23,691
Now, who are these people?

526
00:45:23,693 --> 00:45:25,560
Why are they here?

527
00:45:25,562 --> 00:45:27,930
We need to get into WICKED.

528
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:30,368
Gally said you can get us
through the walls.

529
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,738
Gally should know better
than to make promises

530
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,341
that he can't keep.

531
00:45:42,513 --> 00:45:46,250
Besides, that wall
is only half your problem.

532
00:45:47,283 --> 00:45:50,185
Getting inside WICKED
is impossible.

533
00:45:50,187 --> 00:45:52,256
There might be a way now.

534
00:45:53,256 --> 00:45:55,926
But it doesn't work
without Thomas.

535
00:45:58,863 --> 00:46:00,665
Is that so?

536
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:05,368
Do you know what I am...

537
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:08,104
Thomas?

538
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:15,412
I am a businessman.

539
00:46:18,015 --> 00:46:23,453
Which means that I don't
take unnecessary risks.

540
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,222
Why should I trust you?

541
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:30,225
'Cause I can help you.

542
00:46:30,227 --> 00:46:32,997
You see, if you can get me
through those walls...

543
00:46:33,863 --> 00:46:35,732
I can get you what you need.

544
00:46:37,301 --> 00:46:40,571
What is it
that you think I need?

545
00:46:41,271 --> 00:46:42,339
Time.

546
00:46:44,675 --> 00:46:46,209
Every last drop.

547
00:46:51,314 --> 00:46:53,316
Is that what I need?

548
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:58,421
WICKED has something
we both want.

549
00:47:01,892 --> 00:47:03,461
I'll tell you what.

550
00:47:04,562 --> 00:47:06,828
Two can go for now.

551
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:09,300
The rest stay down here
with me.

552
00:47:11,935 --> 00:47:13,567
Just a little insurance
to make sure

553
00:47:13,569 --> 00:47:15,606
you find your way back.

554
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,613
We have a deal?

555
00:47:32,222 --> 00:47:34,492
Gally, show him the way.

556
00:47:45,935 --> 00:47:47,537
Be careful, Thomas.

557
00:47:50,305 --> 00:47:53,774
Gally, take care of these two.

558
00:47:53,776 --> 00:47:55,078
Yeah.

559
00:48:13,162 --> 00:48:14,662
This is gross.

560
00:48:14,664 --> 00:48:15,732
Jesus.

561
00:48:17,901 --> 00:48:19,436
Yeah, this is great.

562
00:48:29,446 --> 00:48:31,749
Stay with me.
We got a ways to go.

563
00:48:44,627 --> 00:48:46,330
We're ready.

564
00:49:01,479 --> 00:49:02,646
Shai?

565
00:49:06,484 --> 00:49:08,049
Hi, Miss Teresa.

566
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:09,285
Hi.

567
00:49:11,455 --> 00:49:12,456
Hey.

568
00:49:14,823 --> 00:49:16,327
How are you feeling?

569
00:49:17,493 --> 00:49:18,562
Okay.

570
00:49:21,765 --> 00:49:23,767
Is that gonna make me better?

571
00:49:25,535 --> 00:49:26,836
I hope so.

572
00:49:28,537 --> 00:49:31,305
Do you remember the story
you were telling me?

573
00:49:31,307 --> 00:49:33,510
About the house
you grew up in?

574
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:36,944
I don't remember.

575
00:49:36,946 --> 00:49:38,649
The one by the lake?

576
00:49:42,919 --> 00:49:44,118
It burns.

577
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,655
I know, I know.

578
00:49:48,658 --> 00:49:51,162
There we go. All done.

579
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,698
You're so brave.

580
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,631
Oh,
that is incredible.

581
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:32,736
How soon can you administer
to the infected?

582
00:50:34,972 --> 00:50:36,238
You show a lot of compassion

583
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,839
for someone who just
opened fire on a crowd.

584
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:42,245
You told me to do my job.
I had a shot. I took it.

585
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:47,214
And missed, apparently.

586
00:50:47,216 --> 00:50:49,419
The patrols
never found a body.

587
00:50:50,821 --> 00:50:52,656
Thomas is still out there.

588
00:50:54,725 --> 00:50:56,725
What about her?

589
00:50:56,727 --> 00:50:57,962
Does she know?

590
00:51:00,729 --> 00:51:01,731
No.

591
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,635
She can't.

592
00:51:06,002 --> 00:51:08,837
I need her to stay focused.

593
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:12,439
Elevate security levels
throughout the city.

594
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:15,478
I'm counting on you
to handle this, Janson.

595
00:51:26,289 --> 00:51:27,455
<i>Red zone,</i>

596
00:51:27,457 --> 00:51:29,223
<i>departing the station
in five minutes.</i>

597
00:51:29,225 --> 00:51:30,527
<i>Thank you.</i>

598
00:52:04,827 --> 00:52:06,861
This is a long way
from the Glade.

599
00:52:06,863 --> 00:52:09,696
<i>Fifteen
minutes to mandatory curfew.</i>

600
00:52:09,698 --> 00:52:12,600
<i>Please proceed home
in an orderly fashion.</i>

601
00:52:12,602 --> 00:52:15,636
<i>Remember,
this is for your safety.</i>

602
00:52:15,638 --> 00:52:16,705
<i>Thank you for your compliance.</i>

603
00:52:16,707 --> 00:52:18,205
Yeah, we better
get off these streets.

604
00:52:18,207 --> 00:52:21,912
And I know it's hard, but act
like you've seen it before.

605
00:52:46,135 --> 00:52:49,604
They've definitely
upped security.

606
00:52:49,606 --> 00:52:53,308
I'm guessing you shanks have
something to do with that.

607
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,045
All right,
let's get outta here.

608
00:53:03,452 --> 00:53:05,488
All right, Newt, you're up.

609
00:53:11,428 --> 00:53:12,863
I got it.

610
00:53:45,194 --> 00:53:46,562
There it is.

611
00:53:47,631 --> 00:53:49,363
If WICKED's got Minho,

612
00:53:49,365 --> 00:53:51,100
that's where
they'll be keeping him.

613
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,611
Lawrence has been trying
to find a way in for years.

614
00:54:02,312 --> 00:54:04,415
Place is crawling
with soldiers.

615
00:54:05,314 --> 00:54:06,983
They got
surveillance everywhere.

616
00:54:09,185 --> 00:54:11,088
Scanners on every floor.

617
00:54:13,455 --> 00:54:15,589
Sounds like a bloody fortress.

618
00:54:15,591 --> 00:54:17,860
Yeah, I thought you said
you had a way in.

619
00:54:20,363 --> 00:54:21,995
I might.

620
00:54:21,997 --> 00:54:23,263
You might?

621
00:54:23,265 --> 00:54:25,468
What the hell
do you mean "might"?

622
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,575
Take a look.

623
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,725
I said I had a way in.

624
00:54:50,727 --> 00:54:53,163
I didn't say
you were gonna like it.

625
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:02,870
No. There's gotta be
another way.

626
00:55:02,872 --> 00:55:04,504
Like what?
You've seen the building.

627
00:55:04,506 --> 00:55:06,073
She is our only way in.

628
00:55:06,075 --> 00:55:07,709
You really think
she's gonna help us?

629
00:55:07,711 --> 00:55:09,644
I don't plan on
asking for her permission.

630
00:55:09,646 --> 00:55:10,979
Am I missing something here?

631
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:13,848
This is the same girl
who betrayed us, correct?

632
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:15,049
Same dick?

633
00:55:15,051 --> 00:55:16,553
I like her.

634
00:55:17,486 --> 00:55:19,490
What's going on?

635
00:55:22,359 --> 00:55:23,558
What, are you afraid
your little girlfriend's

636
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,028
gonna get hurt?

637
00:55:26,363 --> 00:55:27,828
Hmm?

638
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,196
Because this has
obviously never been

639
00:55:29,198 --> 00:55:30,363
just about rescuing Minho.

640
00:55:30,365 --> 00:55:31,832
Has it?

641
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:33,933
Wait, what are you
talking about?

642
00:55:33,935 --> 00:55:35,370
Teresa.

643
00:55:35,372 --> 00:55:36,571
She's the only reason

644
00:55:36,573 --> 00:55:37,772
that Minho's even missing
in the first place.

645
00:55:37,774 --> 00:55:39,607
Now we finally have an
opportunity to get him back.

646
00:55:39,609 --> 00:55:42,075
And what? You don't want to
because of her?

647
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:43,009
Because deep down inside

648
00:55:43,011 --> 00:55:44,279
you still care about her,
don't you?

649
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:45,580
Just admit it.

650
00:55:45,582 --> 00:55:47,284
- Newt, I...
- Don't lie to me!

651
00:55:48,185 --> 00:55:50,521
Don't lie to me!

652
00:55:58,194 --> 00:55:59,863
Sorry.

653
00:56:03,499 --> 00:56:04,934
I'm sorry.

654
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,298
Sorry about that. Back there.

655
00:56:38,568 --> 00:56:41,171
I guess I can't
hide this anymore.

656
00:56:52,848 --> 00:56:54,751
Why didn't you tell me?

657
00:56:55,685 --> 00:56:57,888
Didn't think it would
make any difference.

658
00:57:02,492 --> 00:57:04,158
All I know is that WICKED
must have put me

659
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,862
in that maze for a reason.

660
00:57:07,263 --> 00:57:08,129
Maybe it was literally

661
00:57:08,131 --> 00:57:09,564
just so they could tell
the difference

662
00:57:09,566 --> 00:57:12,736
between immunes like you
and people like me.

663
00:57:15,638 --> 00:57:17,841
You know we can
still fix this, Newt.

664
00:57:19,376 --> 00:57:21,075
Okay? We can.

665
00:57:21,077 --> 00:57:22,709
Don't worry about me.

666
00:57:22,711 --> 00:57:24,213
This is about Minho.

667
00:57:25,182 --> 00:57:26,883
Now he needs us.

668
00:57:28,017 --> 00:57:31,451
So if there is even
the slightest chance

669
00:57:31,453 --> 00:57:33,120
that we can save him,

670
00:57:33,122 --> 00:57:36,126
we can get him out of there,
then we have to take that.

671
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,731
No matter what the cost.

672
00:57:43,198 --> 00:57:44,767
Okay. I hear you.

673
00:58:09,325 --> 00:58:11,028
Let's get him up.

674
00:58:24,006 --> 00:58:25,075
<i>Minho.</i>

675
00:58:27,743 --> 00:58:29,278
Can you hear me?

676
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,218
There's a little girl here.

677
00:58:36,886 --> 00:58:39,620
Her name is Shai Lun.

678
00:58:39,622 --> 00:58:42,125
She's been infected
for three weeks now.

679
00:58:43,426 --> 00:58:44,795
But, Minho,

680
00:58:45,595 --> 00:58:47,464
you're going to save her.

681
00:58:48,497 --> 00:58:51,233
And you can save
so many others.

682
00:58:53,336 --> 00:58:55,238
Everything we're doing here,

683
00:58:56,372 --> 00:58:57,973
it's working.

684
00:59:00,243 --> 00:59:01,845
Do you understand?

685
00:59:03,513 --> 00:59:06,450
That's why
this is so important.

686
00:59:31,006 --> 00:59:33,309
I just wanted you to know.

687
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,448
Teresa.

688
00:59:46,656 --> 00:59:47,924
Minho?

689
00:59:55,397 --> 00:59:56,466
Minho?

690
00:59:58,434 --> 00:59:59,535
You're a traitor!

691
01:00:01,638 --> 01:00:02,973
We trusted you!

692
01:00:05,307 --> 01:00:07,741
- Get off!
- Hey, let her go!

693
01:00:07,743 --> 01:00:09,946
Get off me! Get off me!

694
01:00:10,713 --> 01:00:13,613
I'll kill you! You traitor!

695
01:00:13,615 --> 01:00:16,183
You killed them all!

696
01:00:26,796 --> 01:00:28,962
Teresa, they need you
in the med lab.

697
01:00:28,964 --> 01:00:30,499
It sounds serious.

698
01:00:38,406 --> 01:00:40,343
I'm sorry, Teresa.

699
01:00:47,883 --> 01:00:50,086
It's not your fault.

700
01:00:51,888 --> 01:00:54,257
You did everything you could.

701
01:02:23,446 --> 01:02:26,446
<i>This is an alert.
Curfew is now in effect.</i>

702
01:02:26,448 --> 01:02:28,048
<i>Anyone caught
in violation of curfew</i>

703
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,415
<i>will be subject
to immediate deportation.</i>

704
01:02:29,417 --> 01:02:30,519
Thomas?

705
01:02:54,642 --> 01:02:55,711
Thomas.

706
01:02:57,946 --> 01:02:59,348
Hey, Teresa.

707
01:03:01,149 --> 01:03:03,084
You shouldn't be here.

708
01:03:03,086 --> 01:03:04,651
If Janson finds out
you're here...

709
01:03:04,653 --> 01:03:06,289
I'm not staying.

710
01:03:08,857 --> 01:03:10,093
It's just, uh...

711
01:03:11,794 --> 01:03:13,463
I had to see you.

712
01:03:15,832 --> 01:03:18,034
I have to ask you something.

713
01:03:21,102 --> 01:03:23,005
Do you regret it?

714
01:03:24,441 --> 01:03:26,142
What you did to us?

715
01:03:30,312 --> 01:03:31,580
Sometimes.

716
01:03:34,249 --> 01:03:36,986
But I did
what I thought was right.

717
01:03:40,589 --> 01:03:42,191
I'd do it again.

718
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:47,731
Good.

719
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:23,298
Taking
the edge off, I see.

720
01:04:24,834 --> 01:04:26,569
Beautiful, isn't it?

721
01:04:29,805 --> 01:04:31,073
Yes.

722
01:04:32,675 --> 01:04:34,676
- It's a lovely city.
- Hmm.

723
01:04:36,312 --> 01:04:37,547
The walls.

724
01:04:40,216 --> 01:04:42,216
It's amazing what people
can accomplish

725
01:04:42,218 --> 01:04:44,951
when their survival's
at stake.

726
01:04:44,953 --> 01:04:48,557
Squeeze them hard enough,
there's nothing they can't do.

727
01:04:50,792 --> 01:04:53,328
No line they won't cross.

728
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:56,997
You've had a bit of a setback.

729
01:04:56,999 --> 01:04:59,102
It's nothing
we're not used to.

730
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,571
Not this time.

731
01:05:03,939 --> 01:05:06,272
The virus is airborne.

732
01:05:06,274 --> 01:05:08,177
It's inside the walls.

733
01:05:09,211 --> 01:05:12,647
That serum
was our last chance.

734
01:05:12,649 --> 01:05:16,352
Anyone not already infected
will be inside of a month.

735
01:05:21,457 --> 01:05:23,122
Okay.

736
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:25,292
We can handle this.

737
01:05:25,294 --> 01:05:27,093
We just need to evacuate
essential personnel,

738
01:05:27,095 --> 01:05:28,729
set up at another safe zone
farther north.

739
01:05:28,731 --> 01:05:31,499
We've still got 28 immunes
right inside this building.

740
01:05:31,501 --> 01:05:32,635
We can find more.

741
01:05:33,468 --> 01:05:34,703
You would.

742
01:05:35,638 --> 01:05:37,404
You'd hunt every last
one of them down

743
01:05:37,406 --> 01:05:39,609
till there was no one left.

744
01:05:44,013 --> 01:05:46,883
In spite of everything
we've done to them,

745
01:05:48,417 --> 01:05:51,254
everything we've put
them through.

746
01:05:58,359 --> 01:06:00,026
At least we gave
them the tools

747
01:06:00,028 --> 01:06:01,731
they'll need to survive.

748
01:06:04,265 --> 01:06:07,336
Maybe they'll succeed
where we've failed.

749
01:06:11,106 --> 01:06:13,709
Are you really telling me
that you're giving up?

750
01:06:14,943 --> 01:06:16,678
After everything?

751
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,450
It's not about
giving up, Janson.

752
01:06:23,385 --> 01:06:26,222
It's about knowing
when you've lost.

753
01:06:49,178 --> 01:06:51,044
Gally?

754
01:06:51,046 --> 01:06:52,848
Here's how this is gonna go.

755
01:06:53,749 --> 01:06:56,716
We're gonna ask you
some questions,

756
01:06:56,718 --> 01:06:59,620
and you're gonna tell us
exactly what we need to know.

757
01:06:59,622 --> 01:07:03,124
We'll start off simple.
Where's Minho?

758
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:05,292
You guys don't
seriously think...

759
01:07:05,294 --> 01:07:07,060
Don't look at him.

760
01:07:07,062 --> 01:07:08,861
Why are you looking at him?

761
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:10,363
Look at me.

762
01:07:10,365 --> 01:07:12,467
He's not gonna help you.

763
01:07:15,138 --> 01:07:17,307
Now, we know you have Minho
in the building.

764
01:07:18,473 --> 01:07:19,475
Where?

765
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:23,109
He's with the others
in holding.

766
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:24,713
Sublevel three.

767
01:07:25,582 --> 01:07:27,283
How many others?

768
01:07:28,684 --> 01:07:29,952
28.

769
01:07:32,053 --> 01:07:33,819
I can make that work.

770
01:07:33,821 --> 01:07:35,923
No.
No, you guys don't understand.

771
01:07:35,925 --> 01:07:38,658
The whole level's restricted.

772
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,660
You can't get in
without a thumbprint ID.

773
01:07:40,662 --> 01:07:42,631
That's why you're
gonna come with us.

774
01:07:43,399 --> 01:07:44,934
Well, I don't know.

775
01:07:46,033 --> 01:07:48,271
We don't necessarily need her.

776
01:07:48,937 --> 01:07:49,939
Right?

777
01:07:51,707 --> 01:07:53,807
Not all of her.

778
01:07:53,809 --> 01:07:56,075
- We just need her finger.
- Gally, back off.

779
01:07:56,077 --> 01:07:57,310
What,
are you squeamish?

780
01:07:57,312 --> 01:07:59,279
I guarantee you she's done
a lot worse to Minho.

781
01:07:59,281 --> 01:08:00,948
That's not the plan.
Back off.

782
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:02,415
It won't make
a difference.

783
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:03,950
Do whatever you want to me.

784
01:08:03,952 --> 01:08:05,685
You still won't get through
the front door.

785
01:08:05,687 --> 01:08:06,953
The sensors will
pick you up the...

786
01:08:06,955 --> 01:08:08,658
We know. We're tagged.

787
01:08:09,959 --> 01:08:11,627
Property of WICKED.

788
01:08:15,131 --> 01:08:17,267
You're gonna help us
with that, too.

789
01:08:23,071 --> 01:08:25,574
Try to relax.
This is gonna sting.

790
01:08:26,542 --> 01:08:28,511
Let's just get it over with.

791
01:08:38,753 --> 01:08:40,286
She enjoyed that.

792
01:08:40,288 --> 01:08:41,921
You're probably right.

793
01:08:41,923 --> 01:08:44,157
Here. See if these fit.

794
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,296
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Newt.

795
01:08:50,632 --> 01:08:52,702
Better get going,
old man.

796
01:08:53,401 --> 01:08:55,337
Long road ahead of you.

797
01:08:56,739 --> 01:08:59,105
You sure I can't
talk you out of this?

798
01:08:59,107 --> 01:09:00,610
It's your last chance.

799
01:09:02,677 --> 01:09:06,346
You know, it's not like you
to shy away from a fight.

800
01:09:06,348 --> 01:09:08,948
And it's not like you
to go looking for one.

801
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,251
I just can't help but think
if I walk out that door...

802
01:09:11,253 --> 01:09:12,922
I'm never gonna see you again.

803
01:09:14,556 --> 01:09:17,827
Since when do we go sticking
our necks out for strangers?

804
01:09:20,529 --> 01:09:22,732
I was a stranger once, too.

805
01:09:32,074 --> 01:09:34,043
- Just don't leave us hanging.
- No.

806
01:09:35,578 --> 01:09:36,646
Never.

807
01:09:44,387 --> 01:09:46,786
She's looking good.

808
01:09:46,788 --> 01:09:47,889
Healthy.

809
01:09:49,757 --> 01:09:51,993
How've you been
getting her serum?

810
01:09:53,628 --> 01:09:55,430
What are you talking about?

811
01:09:56,664 --> 01:09:57,734
Brenda.

812
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:01,937
I didn't think
she'd still be alive.

813
01:10:04,673 --> 01:10:06,441
When was her last treatment?

814
01:10:07,342 --> 01:10:08,878
At the Right Arm.

815
01:10:10,012 --> 01:10:11,881
The last time we saw you.

816
01:10:15,484 --> 01:10:17,620
But that was months ago.

817
01:10:22,357 --> 01:10:24,659
Thomas, that's not possible.

818
01:10:26,194 --> 01:10:28,594
She should have turned by now.

819
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:30,330
There's no way she
could possibly still...

820
01:10:30,332 --> 01:10:31,934
All right, that's enough.

821
01:10:33,636 --> 01:10:34,837
You don't believe me?

822
01:10:35,637 --> 01:10:37,774
Do you really
expect me to?

823
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:42,544
You made your choice.

824
01:10:43,546 --> 01:10:45,681
Everything okay over here?

825
01:10:49,251 --> 01:10:50,453
Yeah.

826
01:10:51,086 --> 01:10:52,622
Yeah, we're done.

827
01:11:03,832 --> 01:11:05,101
Nice try.

828
01:11:14,276 --> 01:11:16,111
You were in love with her,
weren't you?

829
01:11:19,414 --> 01:11:20,783
I don't know.

830
01:11:24,954 --> 01:11:26,452
Just be careful.

831
01:11:26,454 --> 01:11:27,587
You sort of have this problem

832
01:11:27,589 --> 01:11:29,792
where you can't
walk away from people.

833
01:11:30,993 --> 01:11:32,595
Even when you should.

834
01:11:34,762 --> 01:11:37,232
You can't save everyone,
Thomas.

835
01:11:42,003 --> 01:11:43,538
I can try.

836
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,802
Don't stop.

837
01:13:02,117 --> 01:13:03,716
Go, go, go.

838
01:13:03,718 --> 01:13:05,120
Hold on. Hold on.

839
01:13:06,087 --> 01:13:07,353
I can get in here.

840
01:13:07,355 --> 01:13:09,257
Stay there.
Throw me the walkie.

841
01:13:31,814 --> 01:13:34,080
Frypan, we're in.
How you doing?

842
01:13:35,818 --> 01:13:38,020
Yeah, I'm getting there.

843
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,287
Tell Minho "Hi," for me.

844
01:13:41,289 --> 01:13:42,925
<i>Hang in there, buddy.</i>

845
01:13:48,196 --> 01:13:49,728
This'll work.

846
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:51,397
Brenda, what's your status?

847
01:13:51,399 --> 01:13:54,032
Status is, I'm working on it.

848
01:13:54,034 --> 01:13:56,271
<i>Copy. Just make sure
you're ready on your end.</i>

849
01:13:58,774 --> 01:14:00,910
Don't worry.
You know I'm gonna be there.

850
01:14:05,647 --> 01:14:07,350
All right, let's go.

851
01:14:13,055 --> 01:14:14,256
We got a signal.

852
01:14:15,257 --> 01:14:17,189
Gally did it.

853
01:14:17,191 --> 01:14:18,293
We're in.

854
01:14:21,163 --> 01:14:22,231
Good.

855
01:14:23,598 --> 01:14:25,266
Give me everything.

856
01:14:26,435 --> 01:14:28,370
I want full control.

857
01:14:30,638 --> 01:14:32,941
That's funny.
System's glitching.

858
01:14:34,743 --> 01:14:36,646
I'll go check it out.

859
01:14:52,727 --> 01:14:55,161
Get back, get back! Move!

860
01:15:12,681 --> 01:15:14,281
Come on, let's go.

861
01:15:14,283 --> 01:15:16,716
- Get them open.
- Let's go.

862
01:15:16,718 --> 01:15:18,251
It's okay.
You guys are okay. Come on.

863
01:15:18,253 --> 01:15:21,090
Come on, let's go.
Newt, check the other cell.

864
01:15:21,989 --> 01:15:23,991
Come on, you guys are okay.
Come on.

865
01:15:23,993 --> 01:15:26,028
The vault. How do I get in?

866
01:15:27,495 --> 01:15:28,897
You can't.

867
01:15:31,699 --> 01:15:33,233
Come on, guys. Come on.

868
01:15:33,235 --> 01:15:34,867
Guys,

869
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:36,771
this might take some time.

870
01:15:41,176 --> 01:15:42,178
Shit.

871
01:15:43,244 --> 01:15:44,446
He's not here.

872
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:46,748
Where is he?

873
01:15:54,021 --> 01:15:56,357
This really couldn't wait
till morning?

874
01:15:57,493 --> 01:15:58,925
You realize this could
kill him, right?

875
01:15:58,927 --> 01:16:00,425
Taking this much,
all at once.

876
01:16:00,427 --> 01:16:02,194
I have my orders.

877
01:16:02,196 --> 01:16:03,899
Janson wants it all.

878
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:16,276
Somebody's moved him up
to the medical wing.

879
01:16:16,278 --> 01:16:19,147
Thomas, that's on the other
side of the building.

880
01:16:21,016 --> 01:16:22,814
Okay, take me to him.
Right now.

881
01:16:22,816 --> 01:16:24,384
All right.
I'm coming with you.

882
01:16:24,386 --> 01:16:25,484
Newt, no, you're not.

883
01:16:25,486 --> 01:16:27,920
You have to stay here,
wait with Gally for the serum.

884
01:16:27,922 --> 01:16:30,023
You can't do this on your own.

885
01:16:30,025 --> 01:16:31,427
Minho comes first, remember?

886
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,960
Just go. We're wasting time.

887
01:16:33,962 --> 01:16:36,065
I'll get the serum.
We'll meet you out back.

888
01:16:37,699 --> 01:16:39,802
Okay, fine.
Let's go. Come on.

889
01:16:41,703 --> 01:16:43,004
Hey, Greenie.

890
01:16:43,571 --> 01:16:44,806
Good luck.

891
01:16:56,517 --> 01:16:57,919
Keep moving.

892
01:17:11,598 --> 01:17:13,068
Come on, come on.

893
01:17:30,385 --> 01:17:31,453
Hold it.

894
01:17:49,436 --> 01:17:50,972
You're working late.

895
01:17:54,042 --> 01:17:56,510
See, that's what I like
about you, Teresa.

896
01:17:56,512 --> 01:17:59,679
No matter how bleak
things get, you just...

897
01:17:59,681 --> 01:18:01,217
Well, you never give up.

898
01:18:02,318 --> 01:18:04,050
Times like this,

899
01:18:04,052 --> 01:18:06,188
you need a friend
that you can count on.

900
01:18:09,024 --> 01:18:10,926
I'll bear that in mind.

901
01:18:14,895 --> 01:18:16,965
There is one thing
you should know.

902
01:18:17,966 --> 01:18:19,602
One friend to another.

903
01:18:21,802 --> 01:18:23,504
Thomas is here.

904
01:18:32,247 --> 01:18:35,648
A surveillance picked him up
outside the walls.

905
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:36,983
Ava didn't want you to know,

906
01:18:36,985 --> 01:18:39,585
but there is a chance that he
may try to contact you,

907
01:18:39,587 --> 01:18:41,122
and if he does,

908
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:47,196
I'd like to think that
I'd be your first call.

909
01:18:49,864 --> 01:18:51,399
Are you going to kill him?

910
01:18:53,834 --> 01:18:55,537
Would that be a problem?

911
01:19:01,409 --> 01:19:02,578
This is me.

912
01:19:28,637 --> 01:19:30,335
Thomas, you have
to listen to me.

913
01:19:30,337 --> 01:19:32,337
Getting that serum
won't save Newt.

914
01:19:32,339 --> 01:19:34,107
It might buy him
some time, but...

915
01:19:34,109 --> 01:19:35,175
Just ignore her.

916
01:19:35,177 --> 01:19:36,443
She's trying to get
inside your head.

917
01:19:36,445 --> 01:19:38,978
Thomas, listen. You know
what's going on out there.

918
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:42,048
People are dying.
The world is dying.

919
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:44,850
There's something about
your blood I don't understand.

920
01:19:44,852 --> 01:19:46,719
Open it.

921
01:19:46,721 --> 01:19:49,255
If you let me run
some tests...

922
01:19:49,257 --> 01:19:51,224
I promise I can protect you.

923
01:19:51,226 --> 01:19:53,593
Yeah?
Like you protected Minho?

924
01:19:53,595 --> 01:19:54,728
What are you doing?

925
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:56,129
How many people
is it gonna take?

926
01:19:56,131 --> 01:19:57,663
How many more people
do they have to round up,

927
01:19:57,665 --> 01:19:58,799
torture, kill?

928
01:19:58,801 --> 01:19:59,999
Huh? When the hell
does it stop?

929
01:20:00,001 --> 01:20:01,734
It stops when we find a cure.

930
01:20:01,736 --> 01:20:03,605
There is no goddamn cure!

931
01:20:05,806 --> 01:20:08,176
Don't waste your breath,
Teresa.

932
01:20:10,846 --> 01:20:12,812
He made his choice long ago.

933
01:20:12,814 --> 01:20:14,016
Drop it, kid!

934
01:20:17,084 --> 01:20:19,518
Back up.
Tell them to back off.

935
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,719
Tell them to back off!

936
01:20:20,721 --> 01:20:22,520
Hey, Thomas, come on.

937
01:20:22,522 --> 01:20:23,857
It's me.

938
01:20:23,859 --> 01:20:25,825
I've known you longer
than you can remember.

939
01:20:25,827 --> 01:20:27,794
You're not gonna shoot her.

940
01:20:27,796 --> 01:20:29,431
You don't think so?

941
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:32,401
Okay.

942
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:34,336
Go on then.

943
01:20:37,538 --> 01:20:39,072
Shoot her.

944
01:20:40,508 --> 01:20:42,077
Prove me wrong.

945
01:20:47,082 --> 01:20:49,450
Shoot her.

946
01:20:56,425 --> 01:20:57,458
Clear! Clear!

947
01:20:58,126 --> 01:20:59,328
Move! Move!

948
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:12,971
Your story better be good.

949
01:21:12,973 --> 01:21:14,875
I just did you a favor.

950
01:21:14,877 --> 01:21:17,210
Doors are sealed.
They can't get out.

951
01:21:17,212 --> 01:21:20,514
Janson, I need them alive.

952
01:21:20,516 --> 01:21:22,548
- Come on. Come on!
- All right, let's move!

953
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:24,720
Yes, sir!
Level three, now!

954
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:34,361
Okay. We need to get
outta here now.

955
01:21:34,363 --> 01:21:37,697
You stay close to me.
Stick together.

956
01:21:37,699 --> 01:21:41,837
You, you guard this with
your life. You understand?

957
01:21:43,538 --> 01:21:44,740
All right.

958
01:21:45,806 --> 01:21:48,108
Let's go.

959
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:51,477
Lock down the building.
Send everyone up to 20.

960
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:53,212
And someone shut off
those goddamn sirens!

961
01:21:53,214 --> 01:21:54,415
Yes, sir.

962
01:22:00,087 --> 01:22:01,554
Move! Move!

963
01:22:01,556 --> 01:22:02,657
Stay low! Stay low!

964
01:22:03,557 --> 01:22:05,124
Go! Go! Go!

965
01:22:05,126 --> 01:22:07,193
Go! Stay low! Stay low!

966
01:22:07,195 --> 01:22:09,231
Brenda, where are you?
We're here.

967
01:22:13,101 --> 01:22:14,334
Come on, let's go.

968
01:22:14,336 --> 01:22:17,136
All right. Let's go, let's go.
Quickly, quickly.

969
01:22:17,138 --> 01:22:19,238
Front and back,
front and back. Let's go.

970
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,805
Wait, where's Thomas?

971
01:22:20,807 --> 01:22:21,941
I was hoping he was with you.

972
01:22:21,943 --> 01:22:23,042
Come on.

973
01:22:23,044 --> 01:22:24,846
Wait! Wait!
Stay here with the kids.

974
01:22:25,614 --> 01:22:26,815
Wait here...

975
01:22:27,682 --> 01:22:29,115
I'll find him.

976
01:22:29,117 --> 01:22:31,183
Just wait for us, okay?

977
01:22:31,185 --> 01:22:33,085
We're not going anywhere.

978
01:22:33,087 --> 01:22:34,152
Anything?

979
01:22:34,154 --> 01:22:35,353
No sign of them yet, sir.

980
01:22:35,355 --> 01:22:36,421
Yeah, well,
they're here somewhere.

981
01:22:36,423 --> 01:22:37,689
They can't get out. Find them.

982
01:22:37,691 --> 01:22:38,558
You two, that way.

983
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,658
The rest of you,
follow me. Let's go.

984
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:41,529
- Yes, sir!
- Affirmative.

985
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,800
<i>Code 22 in progress.</i>

986
01:22:47,802 --> 01:22:51,640
<i>All R-16 personnel, report
to their assigned stations.</i>

987
01:23:04,186 --> 01:23:06,155
Get down. Get down.

988
01:23:13,761 --> 01:23:15,761
Move! Move! Move!

989
01:23:15,763 --> 01:23:17,266
Stay quiet.

990
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:25,540
Got someone here.

991
01:23:38,052 --> 01:23:39,887
Sorry, Thomas.

992
01:23:46,628 --> 01:23:48,126
Hey,
someone's got the bus.

993
01:23:48,128 --> 01:23:49,194
Hold on!

994
01:23:50,431 --> 01:23:51,930
- Watch it!
- Stop!

995
01:23:51,932 --> 01:23:53,334
No, no, no!

996
01:23:55,102 --> 01:23:56,471
It's all right!

997
01:24:05,113 --> 01:24:06,312
Load up! Load up!

998
01:24:06,314 --> 01:24:08,046
Let's go! Move it!

999
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:09,551
Move! Move!

1000
01:24:10,552 --> 01:24:12,318
<i>All R-16 personnel,</i>

1001
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,389
<i>report to their
assigned stations.</i>

1002
01:24:23,998 --> 01:24:25,764
Thomas! No!

1003
01:24:35,776 --> 01:24:38,480
Minho? Minho!

1004
01:24:39,379 --> 01:24:40,982
- Oh, shit!
- Freeze!

1005
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:44,352
Minho!

1006
01:24:47,689 --> 01:24:49,209
Minho, where are you?

1007
01:24:51,892 --> 01:24:53,492
Minho!

1008
01:24:53,494 --> 01:24:55,761
Doctor,
he's coming out of it.

1009
01:24:55,763 --> 01:24:57,298
Get me another sedative.

1010
01:25:31,031 --> 01:25:32,367
Shit!

1011
01:25:34,269 --> 01:25:36,437
Over here!
There they are!

1012
01:25:41,074 --> 01:25:42,644
I'll cut him off!

1013
01:25:45,145 --> 01:25:46,347
Newt, get down! t

1014
01:25:48,949 --> 01:25:50,818
Shit! I'm almost out.

1015
01:25:57,057 --> 01:25:58,060
Get back.

1016
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,332
Nice. All right.

1017
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:08,533
Let's go! Go!

1018
01:26:08,535 --> 01:26:09,770
You two, freeze!

1019
01:26:10,504 --> 01:26:12,337
Get down on the ground. Now!

1020
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:13,607
I said get your...

1021
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:24,082
Minho.

1022
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:29,057
Is this real?

1023
01:26:30,725 --> 01:26:31,991
I got him!
I got him! Over here.

1024
01:26:31,993 --> 01:26:32,994
Go! This way!

1025
01:26:33,895 --> 01:26:34,963
Come on!

1026
01:26:37,265 --> 01:26:39,368
You three! Stop!

1027
01:26:43,204 --> 01:26:44,606
Come on.

1028
01:26:46,141 --> 01:26:47,376
In here, in here.

1029
01:26:54,347 --> 01:26:55,816
Newt, come on.

1030
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:04,223
Somebody get this door open.

1031
01:27:04,225 --> 01:27:05,627
Yes, sir!

1032
01:27:09,396 --> 01:27:10,598
Oh, shit.

1033
01:27:31,052 --> 01:27:32,587
Any ideas?

1034
01:27:36,156 --> 01:27:37,159
Maybe.

1035
01:27:50,503 --> 01:27:52,673
Okay, it's doable.

1036
01:27:54,575 --> 01:27:57,511
Just need
a little running start.

1037
01:28:02,316 --> 01:28:04,149
Almost through.

1038
01:28:04,151 --> 01:28:05,885
You sure about this?

1039
01:28:05,887 --> 01:28:06,988
Not really.

1040
01:28:07,922 --> 01:28:09,287
Nice pep talk.

1041
01:28:09,289 --> 01:28:11,693
Yeah, we're all
bloody inspired.

1042
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,798
- Move it! Move it!
- Shit.

1043
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:20,802
Go! Go!

1044
01:28:22,436 --> 01:28:23,935
Thomas!

1045
01:28:23,937 --> 01:28:26,574
Oh, shit!

1046
01:29:00,173 --> 01:29:01,775
- Minho, you okay?
- Yeah.

1047
01:29:06,413 --> 01:29:08,613
You three, don't move.

1048
01:29:08,615 --> 01:29:10,718
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1049
01:29:11,418 --> 01:29:13,053
Take it easy.

1050
01:29:17,324 --> 01:29:20,826
Uh-uh-uh!
Don't even think about it.

1051
01:29:20,828 --> 01:29:24,098
Get on your knees
with your hands in the air.

1052
01:29:27,502 --> 01:29:29,671
You son of a bitch.

1053
01:29:38,145 --> 01:29:39,213
Gally?

1054
01:29:40,847 --> 01:29:41,850
Minho.

1055
01:29:43,284 --> 01:29:44,819
You guys are nuts.

1056
01:29:46,654 --> 01:29:48,557
I'll explain later.

1057
01:29:52,793 --> 01:29:55,193
<i>Attention all personnel.</i>

1058
01:29:55,195 --> 01:29:57,328
Drop the net.

1059
01:29:57,330 --> 01:29:59,764
Declare martial law. No one
leaves until they're found.

1060
01:29:59,766 --> 01:30:01,666
It's done, sir. We already
have eyes on the bus.

1061
01:30:01,668 --> 01:30:02,870
Our patrols are in pursuit.

1062
01:30:04,605 --> 01:30:06,206
What bus?

1063
01:30:09,244 --> 01:30:11,613
Shit! Hold on!

1064
01:30:35,436 --> 01:30:36,638
Shit!

1065
01:31:04,498 --> 01:31:06,301
Get out of the vehicle.

1066
01:31:10,671 --> 01:31:12,140
Don't move.

1067
01:31:14,708 --> 01:31:16,243
You're doing great.

1068
01:31:22,682 --> 01:31:25,285
Now step away
from the vehicle.

1069
01:31:26,619 --> 01:31:28,621
I said step away
from the vehicle!

1070
01:31:28,623 --> 01:31:30,357
Put your hands in the air.

1071
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,401
Drop the weapon!

1072
01:31:58,686 --> 01:32:00,121
Here we go.

1073
01:32:06,226 --> 01:32:08,026
Push in! Push in! Go! Go!

1074
01:32:08,028 --> 01:32:10,699
- That bus does not leave!
- Move! Move in!

1075
01:32:11,632 --> 01:32:13,334
Come on, hold on to something!

1076
01:32:16,302 --> 01:32:17,435
Here we go.

1077
01:32:17,437 --> 01:32:20,107
Circle up! Go! Go!
Hold fire!

1078
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:33,954
Brace yourself.

1079
01:32:37,557 --> 01:32:38,792
Sorry.

1080
01:32:46,667 --> 01:32:48,002
Shit.

1081
01:33:23,637 --> 01:33:25,904
Hold on to something!

1082
01:33:50,698 --> 01:33:52,100
t

1083
01:34:10,051 --> 01:34:12,253
Okay. Everybody off.

1084
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:36,176
Shut up.

1085
01:34:46,686 --> 01:34:48,355
They're not out yet.

1086
01:35:04,705 --> 01:35:07,542
Well, they're
definitely pissed.

1087
01:35:08,676 --> 01:35:10,278
How far are the tunnels?

1088
01:35:11,677 --> 01:35:13,011
Uh, maybe 12 blocks from here.

1089
01:35:18,586 --> 01:35:20,088
We can make it.

1090
01:35:23,857 --> 01:35:26,258
Newt, how are you feeling?

1091
01:35:27,828 --> 01:35:29,196
Terrible.

1092
01:35:30,530 --> 01:35:32,531
It's good to see you though.

1093
01:35:37,838 --> 01:35:39,073
Hey.

1094
01:35:39,906 --> 01:35:41,976
How long has he been
like this?

1095
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:45,680
He'll be okay.
We just gotta get to Brenda.

1096
01:35:48,047 --> 01:35:50,081
She's got the serum.

1097
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:51,817
Come on, let's go.

1098
01:35:51,819 --> 01:35:53,285
Hey, Newt.

1099
01:35:53,287 --> 01:35:55,286
Come on, bud.
We gotta get you up. Let's go.

1100
01:35:55,288 --> 01:35:56,554
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1101
01:35:56,556 --> 01:35:58,126
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1102
01:35:59,994 --> 01:36:02,361
Why you helping us, Gally?

1103
01:36:02,363 --> 01:36:04,932
I put a spear
through your chest.

1104
01:36:06,434 --> 01:36:07,435
Yeah.

1105
01:36:08,468 --> 01:36:10,238
Nobody's perfect, man.

1106
01:36:37,464 --> 01:36:38,632
Lawrence!

1107
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,735
Wait, guys.
Wait, wait, wait.

1108
01:36:45,571 --> 01:36:47,441
Where is everyone?

1109
01:36:49,476 --> 01:36:51,078
Wait here, guys. Wait.

1110
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:53,080
Thomas!

1111
01:36:53,614 --> 01:36:54,749
Hey!

1112
01:36:55,615 --> 01:36:56,751
Lawrence!

1113
01:36:57,618 --> 01:36:59,320
Everything's gone.

1114
01:37:38,959 --> 01:37:41,026
Don't be scared.

1115
01:37:41,028 --> 01:37:43,164
I may not be pretty,

1116
01:37:44,096 --> 01:37:46,999
but we all know who
the enemies are,

1117
01:37:47,001 --> 01:37:49,167
cowering behind those walls!

1118
01:37:52,806 --> 01:37:54,374
They have a name

1119
01:37:55,242 --> 01:37:57,977
for people like us in there.

1120
01:37:57,979 --> 01:38:00,248
They call us Cranks!

1121
01:38:01,248 --> 01:38:03,749
But I say that
they are the monsters.

1122
01:38:05,319 --> 01:38:07,685
They're the ones
who started this war,

1123
01:38:07,687 --> 01:38:08,689
but tonight,

1124
01:38:09,756 --> 01:38:11,392
we will finish it.

1125
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,993
Follow me.

1126
01:38:14,995 --> 01:38:16,928
Follow me,
and we will show them

1127
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:18,531
the faces of the people

1128
01:38:18,533 --> 01:38:21,133
that they have chosen
to forget!

1129
01:38:25,506 --> 01:38:28,443
Follow me
and this city is yours!

1130
01:38:30,677 --> 01:38:32,079
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1131
01:38:52,967 --> 01:38:54,735
Let's move it!

1132
01:38:57,137 --> 01:38:58,706
Let's go!

1133
01:39:11,552 --> 01:39:13,184
<i>Control,
you seeing this?</i>

1134
01:39:13,186 --> 01:39:14,853
<i>Please advise.</i>

1135
01:39:14,855 --> 01:39:15,987
Holy shit.

1136
01:39:15,989 --> 01:39:18,492
Get turrets one
and two ready to fire.

1137
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:27,901
Guns aren't responding.
I'm locked out.

1138
01:39:30,204 --> 01:39:31,803
All right. Move forward.

1139
01:39:31,805 --> 01:39:33,774
Open fire! Open fire!

1140
01:39:56,262 --> 01:39:57,696
We're supposed
to take down WICKED,

1141
01:39:57,698 --> 01:39:59,167
not the whole damn city.

1142
01:40:03,169 --> 01:40:04,803
Gally, come on.

1143
01:40:17,383 --> 01:40:19,684
<i>This is
a mandatory evacuation.</i>

1144
01:40:19,686 --> 01:40:22,953
<i>The last transport leaves
in 38 minutes.</i>

1145
01:40:22,955 --> 01:40:25,156
<i>Please proceed to the roof.</i>

1146
01:40:25,158 --> 01:40:27,658
<i>I repeat, this is
a mandatory evacuation.</i>

1147
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:31,029
Teresa, what are you still
doing here? We have to leave.

1148
01:40:31,031 --> 01:40:33,698
No, I can't leave.
Not without Thomas.

1149
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:35,434
It's too late for that.
He's gone.

1150
01:40:35,436 --> 01:40:38,702
No. You don't understand.

1151
01:40:38,704 --> 01:40:40,274
I need more.

1152
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:42,577
Come. Look.

1153
01:40:46,413 --> 01:40:47,981
It's not just slowing
the virus down.

1154
01:40:52,285 --> 01:40:54,355
It's destroying it.

1155
01:40:58,859 --> 01:41:00,928
We need to find Thomas.

1156
01:41:02,195 --> 01:41:03,862
Tunnels are right up ahead.

1157
01:41:03,864 --> 01:41:05,130
Shit!

1158
01:41:05,132 --> 01:41:07,702
Hey! Stay low! Stay low!

1159
01:41:16,877 --> 01:41:18,279
Shit!

1160
01:41:18,745 --> 01:41:20,411
Get ready!

1161
01:41:20,413 --> 01:41:22,380
All right, move up! Move up!

1162
01:41:22,382 --> 01:41:23,717
Frontline down!

1163
01:41:25,752 --> 01:41:26,988
Damn it!

1164
01:41:29,957 --> 01:41:31,723
What are they waiting for?

1165
01:41:39,432 --> 01:41:40,900
Get down, get down!

1166
01:41:48,374 --> 01:41:49,909
Stay down! Stay down!

1167
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:57,450
We gotta go. We gotta go.

1168
01:42:00,553 --> 01:42:02,690
Come on.
Let's move, let's move.

1169
01:42:19,405 --> 01:42:21,441
<i>Get him in, get him in.</i>

1170
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:25,277
<i>Brenda, are you there?</i>

1171
01:42:25,279 --> 01:42:26,944
Thomas, I'm here.

1172
01:42:28,181 --> 01:42:30,318
Shit! You okay?

1173
01:42:31,083 --> 01:42:32,886
We're not gonna make it.

1174
01:42:34,421 --> 01:42:36,453
Wait, what are you
talking about?

1175
01:42:36,455 --> 01:42:38,189
Don't let them get away!

1176
01:42:38,191 --> 01:42:40,392
Just take the others.
Get everybody out

1177
01:42:40,394 --> 01:42:41,896
<i>while you still can.</i>

1178
01:42:42,662 --> 01:42:43,731
No.

1179
01:42:44,931 --> 01:42:46,334
Brenda.

1180
01:42:47,368 --> 01:42:49,003
I'm not leaving you.

1181
01:42:49,802 --> 01:42:50,837
Okay?

1182
01:42:51,471 --> 01:42:53,473
So forget it.

1183
01:42:56,275 --> 01:42:58,011
Even though you should?

1184
01:43:13,394 --> 01:43:18,295
<i>Thomas, don't worry.
I'm coming to you.</i>

1185
01:43:18,297 --> 01:43:19,666
What are you talking about?

1186
01:43:21,502 --> 01:43:23,934
Our ride's here!

1187
01:43:28,943 --> 01:43:31,011
<i>Just look for us
near the tunnels.</i>

1188
01:43:34,448 --> 01:43:36,581
Let's go, guys! Move!
Our ride's here!

1189
01:43:36,583 --> 01:43:38,182
- Careful.
- Move! Move!

1190
01:43:38,184 --> 01:43:40,421
Watch your step. Okay?

1191
01:43:45,726 --> 01:43:46,758
Vince?

1192
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:49,327
Hey, it's good
to see you, too.

1193
01:43:49,329 --> 01:43:50,828
Yeah, I know.

1194
01:43:50,830 --> 01:43:52,363
I picked up a stray.

1195
01:43:52,365 --> 01:43:53,430
Let's get out of here,
all right?

1196
01:43:53,432 --> 01:43:54,666
We're not done yet.

1197
01:43:54,668 --> 01:43:56,837
Thomas is still inside.

1198
01:44:00,306 --> 01:44:02,807
Well, let's go get him then.

1199
01:44:02,809 --> 01:44:04,041
- Hell yeah.
- All right, let's go.

1200
01:44:04,043 --> 01:44:05,643
- On board. Everybody.
- Let's go! Step up! Step up!

1201
01:44:05,645 --> 01:44:07,885
- We gotta move, we gotta move.
- Take a seat, harness...

1202
01:44:16,957 --> 01:44:19,124
All right.
Newt, we're almost there.

1203
01:44:19,126 --> 01:44:20,761
Just leave me.

1204
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:25,930
Back! Back!

1205
01:44:25,932 --> 01:44:27,700
Let's go! Let's go!

1206
01:44:29,169 --> 01:44:30,471
Take 'em out!

1207
01:44:47,454 --> 01:44:49,053
- Okay, that's them.
- Yeah.

1208
01:44:49,055 --> 01:44:50,354
It's them. We gotta go.

1209
01:44:50,356 --> 01:44:51,423
- We gotta go.
- Go without me, man.

1210
01:44:51,425 --> 01:44:52,659
You should just...

1211
01:45:01,702 --> 01:45:03,468
Minho.

1212
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:05,770
You gotta run ahead,
grab the serum,

1213
01:45:05,772 --> 01:45:08,007
and get back to us
as soon as you can.

1214
01:45:11,043 --> 01:45:12,712
Minho, go.

1215
01:45:13,547 --> 01:45:15,816
He's right. I can cover.

1216
01:45:21,187 --> 01:45:22,556
Thank you.

1217
01:45:23,323 --> 01:45:24,725
Thank you, Minho.

1218
01:45:26,059 --> 01:45:28,796
Hey, you just hang on.

1219
01:45:29,329 --> 01:45:30,965
You hear me?

1220
01:45:36,035 --> 01:45:37,671
Go, Minho, go!

1221
01:45:40,306 --> 01:45:42,041
Okay, they're through.

1222
01:46:05,698 --> 01:46:07,133
Newt? Newt?

1223
01:46:08,068 --> 01:46:10,538
Hey! Hey! Newt! Hey!

1224
01:46:11,805 --> 01:46:13,670
We're gonna try this. Okay?

1225
01:46:13,672 --> 01:46:16,308
We gotta move, now.
Let's get you up, come on.

1226
01:46:16,310 --> 01:46:17,742
- Let's go, come on.
- No. No, Thomas.

1227
01:46:17,744 --> 01:46:19,676
No, Newt. Later. Later.
Really gotta go.

1228
01:46:19,678 --> 01:46:20,879
- Come on.
- Look, you gotta take this.

1229
01:46:20,881 --> 01:46:22,721
- We gotta get you up, now.
- No, just take it!

1230
01:46:27,052 --> 01:46:28,286
Please.

1231
01:46:28,288 --> 01:46:30,758
Please, Tommy. Please.

1232
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:34,227
All right.

1233
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:41,999
All right. I need you
to give me everything you got.

1234
01:46:42,001 --> 01:46:43,867
You and me, right now.
Let's go. You ready?

1235
01:46:43,869 --> 01:46:46,138
Come on, ready? Here we go.

1236
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:48,008
One, two, three.

1237
01:47:05,691 --> 01:47:07,258
Get back, guys, get back!

1238
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:08,292
Oh, man.

1239
01:47:08,294 --> 01:47:10,261
It's okay, guys. We're getting
out of here soon.

1240
01:47:10,263 --> 01:47:11,931
We can't stay here, Bren.

1241
01:47:12,699 --> 01:47:15,666
Don't worry. They'll be here.

1242
01:47:15,668 --> 01:47:17,171
Come on. Come on.

1243
01:47:26,079 --> 01:47:28,278
We're almost there, Newt.
Stay with me, come on.

1244
01:47:29,415 --> 01:47:31,817
Newt, no, no. Hey!

1245
01:47:37,524 --> 01:47:38,792
Come on.

1246
01:47:53,339 --> 01:47:54,775
<i>Thomas?</i>

1247
01:47:58,345 --> 01:47:59,713
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1248
01:48:02,281 --> 01:48:03,650
<i>I need you to listen to me.</i>

1249
01:48:05,185 --> 01:48:07,888
I know you have
no reason to trust me,

1250
01:48:12,426 --> 01:48:14,328
but I need you to come back.

1251
01:48:17,763 --> 01:48:21,234
<i>Thomas, you can save Newt.</i>

1252
01:48:22,968 --> 01:48:25,204
<i>There's still time for him.</i>

1253
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:30,474
There's a reason
Brenda isn't sick anymore.

1254
01:48:30,476 --> 01:48:32,311
<i>It's your blood.</i>

1255
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:35,815
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1256
01:48:36,649 --> 01:48:38,452
<i>She isn't sick,</i>

1257
01:48:39,418 --> 01:48:41,421
<i>because you cured her.</i>

1258
01:48:44,591 --> 01:48:47,061
<i>She doesn't have to be
the only one.</i>

1259
01:48:48,895 --> 01:48:51,595
<i>All you have to do
is come back.</i>

1260
01:48:51,597 --> 01:48:54,068
<i>And this will all
finally be over.</i>

1261
01:48:58,003 --> 01:48:59,038
Please.

1262
01:49:00,739 --> 01:49:02,775
Just come back to me.

1263
01:49:04,811 --> 01:49:06,280
<i>I know you'll do the right...</i>

1264
01:49:21,528 --> 01:49:22,730
Newt?

1265
01:49:32,471 --> 01:49:34,006
Newt?

1266
01:49:37,142 --> 01:49:40,146
Newt? Newt, it's me. It's me!

1267
01:49:46,284 --> 01:49:47,354
Brenda!

1268
01:49:49,254 --> 01:49:50,554
Where's the serum?

1269
01:49:54,694 --> 01:49:57,263
Tommy, kill me!

1270
01:49:57,763 --> 01:50:00,234
Newt, I'm here.

1271
01:50:06,606 --> 01:50:09,208
Newt, please!

1272
01:50:10,243 --> 01:50:11,776
Please!

1273
01:50:17,883 --> 01:50:20,520
I'm sorry, Tommy.

1274
01:50:21,454 --> 01:50:23,290
It's okay. It's okay.

1275
01:50:27,427 --> 01:50:28,862
No!

1276
01:50:32,397 --> 01:50:34,264
Brenda!

1277
01:50:34,266 --> 01:50:35,832
Thomas!

1278
01:50:35,834 --> 01:50:37,236
Stay down, stay down!

1279
01:51:03,262 --> 01:51:04,397
Newt.

1280
01:51:21,314 --> 01:51:22,415
Tommy.

1281
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:28,355
No, no.

1282
01:51:37,363 --> 01:51:39,232
No, no, no.

1283
01:51:44,570 --> 01:51:45,571
Newt?

1284
01:53:52,966 --> 01:53:54,401
Is it true?

1285
01:53:58,605 --> 01:53:59,606
Newt.

1286
01:54:03,008 --> 01:54:04,578
Could I have saved him?

1287
01:54:07,913 --> 01:54:10,016
You can save us all.

1288
01:54:32,739 --> 01:54:33,807
It's okay.

1289
01:54:37,644 --> 01:54:39,678
Just leave the others alone.

1290
01:54:43,048 --> 01:54:44,517
I promise.

1291
01:54:48,855 --> 01:54:50,156
I will...

1292
01:55:45,878 --> 01:55:47,481
Oh, Thomas.

1293
01:55:52,752 --> 01:55:54,788
You should have run.

1294
01:55:57,589 --> 01:55:58,792
<i>Thomas.</i>

1295
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:03,227
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1296
01:56:29,488 --> 01:56:31,825
Do you know what
this place is, Thomas?

1297
01:56:35,727 --> 01:56:37,564
It's a lifeboat.

1298
01:56:39,031 --> 01:56:42,332
And the whole world
might be sinking,

1299
01:56:42,334 --> 01:56:45,238
but doesn't mean that
we have to go down with it.

1300
01:56:47,673 --> 01:56:49,339
How much longer?

1301
01:56:49,341 --> 01:56:51,178
It's almost done.

1302
01:56:56,315 --> 01:56:57,781
Why don't you just kill me?

1303
01:56:57,783 --> 01:56:59,186
Kill you?

1304
01:57:00,052 --> 01:57:02,222
No, we don't wanna do that.

1305
01:57:05,091 --> 01:57:07,727
We're gonna take
special care of you.

1306
01:57:08,961 --> 01:57:10,664
We'll keep you alive.

1307
01:57:11,297 --> 01:57:12,531
Just.

1308
01:57:15,234 --> 01:57:17,401
And in return,

1309
01:57:17,403 --> 01:57:20,304
you will give life
to the rest of us.

1310
01:57:20,306 --> 01:57:22,943
The ones we choose
to save, anyway.

1311
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:29,546
Of course, there's not gonna
be enough for everyone.

1312
01:57:29,548 --> 01:57:31,814
Hard choices are gonna
have to be made.

1313
01:57:31,816 --> 01:57:34,852
In time, the Flare virus
will burn itself out.

1314
01:57:34,854 --> 01:57:36,519
The only question is,

1315
01:57:36,521 --> 01:57:40,459
who will be the ones
left standing?

1316
01:57:42,861 --> 01:57:46,029
And thanks to you,
to this,

1317
01:57:46,031 --> 01:57:48,702
we finally get to choose.

1318
01:57:50,903 --> 01:57:54,373
A future of our own making.

1319
01:58:01,047 --> 01:58:02,281
To your health.

1320
01:58:10,088 --> 01:58:11,957
Okay, let's get out of here.

1321
01:58:15,026 --> 01:58:16,029
Come on.

1322
01:58:20,333 --> 01:58:21,534
No!

1323
01:58:28,274 --> 01:58:30,541
Get back here.

1324
01:58:30,543 --> 01:58:31,776
Get back!

1325
01:58:31,778 --> 01:58:32,878
No!

1326
01:58:34,346 --> 01:58:35,614
Give it to me.

1327
01:58:38,318 --> 01:58:39,619
Give it to me!

1328
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,555
Teresa!

1329
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:19,359
Come on.

1330
01:59:31,736 --> 01:59:33,105
Okay.

1331
01:59:34,274 --> 01:59:35,607
That's enough.

1332
01:59:47,153 --> 01:59:48,452
Weapons ready!

1333
01:59:48,454 --> 01:59:49,920
On my command.

1334
01:59:49,922 --> 01:59:51,956
Charge it!

1335
01:59:51,958 --> 01:59:53,693
Ready.

1336
01:59:54,092 --> 01:59:55,127
Fire!

1337
02:00:07,873 --> 02:00:09,109
Teresa!

1338
02:00:18,016 --> 02:00:20,019
We need to get out of here.

1339
02:00:20,854 --> 02:00:22,419
What's wrong?

1340
02:00:25,790 --> 02:00:26,825
Thomas?

1341
02:00:27,959 --> 02:00:29,162
Thomas!

1342
02:00:35,868 --> 02:00:37,736
- Okay. Okay, we need to...
- Oh, shit...

1343
02:00:39,071 --> 02:00:41,607
Find something.
Here. Here!

1344
02:00:42,675 --> 02:00:45,309
Just put pressure on it.
Hold it.

1345
02:00:46,912 --> 02:00:48,147
You gotta go.

1346
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:51,182
You gotta go.

1347
02:00:51,184 --> 02:00:52,185
No.

1348
02:00:53,119 --> 02:00:54,587
Not without you.

1349
02:01:20,546 --> 02:01:22,949
I admit, Teresa,
you had me fooled.

1350
02:01:24,583 --> 02:01:26,819
I thought we were friends.

1351
02:01:32,725 --> 02:01:35,126
Maybe it's just
in your nature to betray

1352
02:01:35,128 --> 02:01:37,664
the people closest to you.

1353
02:01:44,837 --> 02:01:46,506
Come on.

1354
02:01:48,339 --> 02:01:50,810
Let's not prolong this.

1355
02:01:53,079 --> 02:01:55,949
We both know
there's no way outta here.

1356
02:01:59,752 --> 02:02:01,585
Let's not make this
any more painful

1357
02:02:01,587 --> 02:02:03,756
than it needs to be.

1358
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:09,062
Thomas.

1359
02:02:13,065 --> 02:02:14,067
Teresa.

1360
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:31,149
No. No.

1361
02:02:34,387 --> 02:02:37,624
I think you have
something of mine.

1362
02:02:47,231 --> 02:02:48,700
Not that.

1363
02:02:50,369 --> 02:02:51,838
Where is he?

1364
02:02:52,372 --> 02:02:54,571
Just take it.

1365
02:02:54,573 --> 02:02:56,340
Leave him alone.

1366
02:02:56,342 --> 02:02:58,144
What is it with you two?

1367
02:02:58,845 --> 02:03:02,112
You think he's so special?

1368
02:03:02,114 --> 02:03:04,247
He's a lab rat.
He was born with a gift.

1369
02:03:04,249 --> 02:03:07,751
He never had to fight for it,
he never earned it.

1370
02:03:07,753 --> 02:03:09,856
He doesn't deserve it.

1371
02:03:10,455 --> 02:03:11,958
Maybe.

1372
02:03:13,025 --> 02:03:14,293
But it's his.

1373
02:03:17,495 --> 02:03:19,031
What about you, Thomas?

1374
02:03:20,332 --> 02:03:22,765
What do you have to say?

1375
02:03:22,767 --> 02:03:25,738
Don't you have enough blood
on your hands already?

1376
02:03:26,971 --> 02:03:29,305
You might not have been
able to shoot her.

1377
02:03:29,307 --> 02:03:31,077
But I can.

1378
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:36,950
Okay. Fine.

1379
02:03:37,449 --> 02:03:38,581
Have it your way.

1380
02:03:40,052 --> 02:03:41,184
Janson.

1381
02:03:46,758 --> 02:03:48,328
Missed, you little shit.

1382
02:03:49,294 --> 02:03:50,296
Did I?

1383
02:03:56,668 --> 02:03:58,037
Oh, shit.

1384
02:04:06,477 --> 02:04:08,411
Come on. We need to go.

1385
02:04:17,222 --> 02:04:19,691
This way. Here.

1386
02:04:29,635 --> 02:04:31,037
Come on.

1387
02:04:55,427 --> 02:04:56,663
Come on.

1388
02:05:40,172 --> 02:05:41,441
I'm sorry.

1389
02:05:43,141 --> 02:05:44,409
I tried.

1390
02:05:49,213 --> 02:05:50,449
I know.

1391
02:06:10,435 --> 02:06:12,236
I think I got him.

1392
02:06:12,238 --> 02:06:13,670
Yeah, that's him.
I'll get the hatch.

1393
02:06:13,672 --> 02:06:14,737
All right, I got him,
I got him.

1394
02:06:14,739 --> 02:06:15,941
Let's go, let's go.

1395
02:06:17,641 --> 02:06:19,111
Come on.

1396
02:06:32,525 --> 02:06:33,926
No!

1397
02:06:37,895 --> 02:06:40,165
I can't get any closer.

1398
02:06:44,837 --> 02:06:46,038
Thomas!

1399
02:06:48,306 --> 02:06:49,407
Now!

1400
02:07:00,753 --> 02:07:02,221
Come on, come on, come on.

1401
02:07:03,855 --> 02:07:06,622
- Come on!
- Come on, Thomas!

1402
02:07:06,624 --> 02:07:08,426
Give me your hand!

1403
02:07:08,894 --> 02:07:10,797
Get closer!

1404
02:07:11,529 --> 02:07:12,564
Jump!

1405
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:15,802
Lower!

1406
02:07:19,171 --> 02:07:20,603
No!

1407
02:07:20,605 --> 02:07:22,207
You gotta get closer.

1408
02:07:36,387 --> 02:07:37,556
Come on!

1409
02:07:38,723 --> 02:07:39,956
Yeah!

1410
02:07:39,958 --> 02:07:41,961
- Come on, reach! Come on!
- Reach!

1411
02:07:45,530 --> 02:07:46,865
- Pull him up!
- Pull!

1412
02:07:48,534 --> 02:07:49,569
Come on!

1413
02:07:50,401 --> 02:07:51,404
Come on!

1414
02:07:57,676 --> 02:07:59,178
Teresa!

1415
02:08:15,327 --> 02:08:16,596
No!

1416
02:12:00,084 --> 02:12:02,221
<i>We have come
a long way together.</i>

1417
02:12:03,355 --> 02:12:06,689
So many have sacrificed
so much

1418
02:12:06,691 --> 02:12:08,560
to make this place possible.

1419
02:12:09,927 --> 02:12:11,430
Your friends

1420
02:12:12,931 --> 02:12:14,132
and your family.

1421
02:12:16,435 --> 02:12:20,036
So here's to the ones
who couldn't be here.

1422
02:12:20,038 --> 02:12:21,774
Here's to the friends we lost.

1423
02:12:24,575 --> 02:12:27,712
This place is for you.
It's for all of us.

1424
02:12:28,881 --> 02:12:30,449
But this,

1425
02:12:31,283 --> 02:12:33,218
this is for them.

1426
02:12:34,419 --> 02:12:37,823
So, in your own time,
in your own way,

1427
02:12:39,391 --> 02:12:41,293
come make your peace.

1428
02:12:43,427 --> 02:12:45,728
And welcome to the Safe Haven.

1429
02:12:45,730 --> 02:12:47,930
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1430
02:13:04,048 --> 02:13:05,383
You all want some food?

1431
02:13:09,587 --> 02:13:11,857
This is gonna be
a good home for us.

1432
02:13:15,827 --> 02:13:16,829
Yeah.

1433
02:13:30,441 --> 02:13:33,178
You had this on you
while you were passed out.

1434
02:13:37,982 --> 02:13:40,386
Figured I'd keep it
safe for ya.

1435
02:13:44,056 --> 02:13:45,958
Thanks, Minho.

1436
02:13:47,959 --> 02:13:49,826
See you out there.

1437
02:13:49,828 --> 02:13:51,564
See ya.

1438
02:14:46,118 --> 02:14:48,050
<i>Dear Thomas...</i>

1439
02:14:48,052 --> 02:14:51,787
<i>This is the first letter
I can remember writing.</i>

1440
02:14:51,789 --> 02:14:55,558
<i>Obviously, I don't know if I
wrote any before the maze.</i>

1441
02:14:55,560 --> 02:15:00,862
<i>But even if it's not my first,
it's likely to be my last.</i>

1442
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:03,635
<i>I want you to know
that I'm not scared.</i>

1443
02:15:04,569 --> 02:15:06,368
<i>Well, not of dying, anyway.</i>

1444
02:15:06,370 --> 02:15:09,304
<i>It's more forgetting.</i>

1445
02:15:09,306 --> 02:15:11,206
<i>It's losing myself
to this virus.</i>

1446
02:15:11,208 --> 02:15:13,278
<i>That's what scares me.</i>

1447
02:15:16,815 --> 02:15:19,782
<i>So every night I've been
saying their names out loud.</i>

1448
02:15:19,784 --> 02:15:21,084
<i>Alby...</i>

1449
02:15:21,086 --> 02:15:23,055
<i>Winston, Chuck.</i>

1450
02:15:24,588 --> 02:15:26,723
<i>And I just repeat them
over and over,</i>

1451
02:15:26,725 --> 02:15:29,091
<i>like a prayer,</i>

1452
02:15:29,093 --> 02:15:31,029
<i>and it all comes
flooding back.</i>

1453
02:15:34,399 --> 02:15:35,665
<i>Just the little things,
like the way</i>

1454
02:15:35,667 --> 02:15:36,832
<i>the sun used to
hit the Glade</i>

1455
02:15:36,834 --> 02:15:39,035
<i>at that perfect moment
right before</i>

1456
02:15:39,037 --> 02:15:41,437
<i>it slipped beneath the walls.</i>

1457
02:15:41,439 --> 02:15:45,075
<i>And I remember the taste
of Frypan's stew.</i>

1458
02:15:45,077 --> 02:15:47,445
<i>I never thought
I'd miss that stuff so much.</i>

1459
02:15:50,515 --> 02:15:52,648
<i>And I remember you.</i>

1460
02:15:52,650 --> 02:15:55,017
<i>I remember the first time you
came up in the Box.</i>

1461
02:15:55,019 --> 02:15:56,419
<i>Just a scared little Greenie</i>

1462
02:15:56,421 --> 02:15:58,557
<i>who couldn't even remember
his own name.</i>

1463
02:15:59,656 --> 02:16:01,424
<i>But from that moment
you ran into the maze,</i>

1464
02:16:01,426 --> 02:16:03,861
<i>I knew I would
follow you anywhere.</i>

1465
02:16:05,431 --> 02:16:06,999
<i>And I have.</i>

1466
02:16:08,934 --> 02:16:10,802
<i>We all have.</i>

1467
02:16:14,306 --> 02:16:16,505
<i>If I could do it
all over again, I would</i>

1468
02:16:16,507 --> 02:16:21,478
<i>and I wouldn't
change a thing.</i>

1469
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:24,714
<i>And my hope for you</i>

1470
02:16:24,716 --> 02:16:26,683
<i>is that when you're looking
back years from now,</i>

1471
02:16:26,685 --> 02:16:28,986
<i>you'll be able
to say the same.</i>

1472
02:16:31,823 --> 02:16:35,490
<i>The future's
in your hands now, Tommy.</i>

1473
02:16:35,492 --> 02:16:38,029
<i>And I know you'll find a way
to do what's right.</i>

1474
02:16:39,464 --> 02:16:41,033
<i>You always have.</i>

1475
02:16:43,068 --> 02:16:44,902
<i>Take care of everyone for me.</i>

1476
02:16:46,503 --> 02:16:48,473
<i>And take care of yourself.</i>

1477
02:16:50,341 --> 02:16:52,610
<i>You deserve to be happy.</i>

1478
02:16:56,013 --> 02:16:57,982
<i>Thank you for being my friend.</i>

1479
02:17:00,953 --> 02:17:03,018
<i>Goodbye, mate.</i>
