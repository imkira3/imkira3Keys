2
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,432
Who are you?

3
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,611
What is this?

4
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,281
Your Majesty, caught him up
in a fishing net. A fishing net.

5
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,367
Sire, he's been telling stories.
Stories that...

6
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,410
We believe he's found a...

7
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,337
Ponce de León.

8
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,800
Says he found
Ponce de León's ship.

9
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,678
- Or sailed on it.
- No, I told you,

10
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,097
Ponce de León died 200 years ago.

11
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,767
Aye, but he died searching
for something, didn't he?

12
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,188
The Fountain of Youth.

13
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,070
How soon can you sail?

14
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,490
With the tide.

15
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,759
Over here!
Lucky heather!

16
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,971
Pirate swords! Pirate swords!

17
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,516
Pirate's execution today.
Watch him swing!

18
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,518
Pirate puppets!

19
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,186
Take that, you!

20
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,147
Hurry, Papa, or we'll miss the hanging!

21
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:54,984
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.
The hanging comes this afternoon.

22
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,777
Pirate hanging today!

23
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,616
Come on. Up you get.

24
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,493
Move along, pirate.

25
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,039
Or should I say, "Captain Pirate"?

26
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,418
Come on. Come on! Up you go.

27
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,420
Quiet! Order!

28
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,298
Quiet!

29
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,884
Now appearing before the court,

30
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:23,262
the notorious and infamous
pirate, pillager,

31
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,805
- and highwayman...
- Quiet!

32
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,641
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

33
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,398
I told you, the name's Gibbs!
Joshamee Gibbs!

34
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,359
- How many times...
- Hear ye, hear ye!

35
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,818
Presiding over these trials,

36
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:43,574
all rise and attend,
the Right Honorable Justice Smith!

37
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,127
My dear sir.

38
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,049
Quiet!

39
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,678
Now...

40
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,056
...what do we have here?

41
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,516
Jack?

42
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,142
Shut up!

43
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:11,936
I don't recognize him.

44
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,272
Not necessary. You were saying?

45
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,067
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

46
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,111
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

47
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,988
Is that so?

48
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,157
- It says Jack Sparrow here.
- I told 'em.

49
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,452
I'm not Jack Sparrow, who I would
be happy to identify to the court

50
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,497
- if it would help my case.
- I think that would be a poor defense,

51
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,333
unless you want to be bludgeoned again
like a harp seal.

52
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,628
The prisoner claims of being innocent

53
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,172
to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

54
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,050
No trial? But aren't we here
to examine the evidence...

55
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,720
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

56
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,722
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.

57
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,559
Hang him! String him up!

58
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,355
- Guilty?
- That's not fair!

59
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,732
Shut it.

60
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,778
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime ofwhich
you've been found guilty of

61
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,656
is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.

62
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,200
I hereby commute your sentence,

63
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,995
and order that you be imprisoned
for the remainder

64
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,998
of your miserable, moribund,
mutton-chopped life.

65
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,083
- What?!
- Hang him!

66
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,418
- Hang him!
- There.

67
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,921
- Balderdash!
- String him up! Hang him high!

68
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,217
Means shall be arranged
to transport this prisoner

69
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,386
to the Tower of London.

70
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,191
Thanks very much.

71
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,780
Ta.

72
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,203
Come on. Get up there.

73
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,332
Get up!

74
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,673
Hell's teeth.
Now we're both headed for prison.

75
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,510
Not to worry.
I've paid off the driver.

76
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,013
Ten minutes, we'll be outside
London Town, horses waiting.

77
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,681
Tonight, we make the coast.

78
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,184
Then it's just a matter
of finding a ship.

79
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,105
- All part of the plan, yes?
- Exactly.

80
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,190
I arrived in London Town
just this morning

81
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,485
to rescue one Joshamee Gibbs
from one appointment with the gallows.

82
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,403
Seeing as how you're still alive,

83
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,281
I'd say it's all been
very successful thus far.

84
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,158
What happened to you, Gibbs?

85
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,869
I thought you were employed elsewhere
or otherwise engaged.

86
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,498
Aye. But I always listened like a thief
for news of the Black Pearl.

87
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,084
Nobody's seen where
she might next make port.

88
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,294
Then, I hear a rumor:

89
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,923
Jack Sparrow's in London
with a ship and looking for a crew.

90
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,800
- Am not.
- But that's what I heard.

91
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,177
Fact is, you're signing up men tonight.

92
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,846
Pub called The Captain's Daughter.

93
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,224
- Am not!
- Well, I thought it a bit odd,

94
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,061
but then, you've never been
the most predictable of sorts.

95
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,230
Tell me something.

96
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,900
There is another Jack Sparrow out there
sullying my good name?

97
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,194
- An impostor.
- Indeed.

98
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:11,073
But... an impostor with a ship.

99
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,784
And in need of a crew.

100
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,953
Which, as fate would have it, so am I.

101
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,581
What about you, Jack?

102
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,585
Last I heard, you were hell-bent
to find the Fountain of Youth.

103
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,253
Any luck?

104
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,258
Circumstances arose
and forced a compelling insight

105
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,385
regarding discretion and valor.

106
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,638
- Meaning, you gave up.
- I did not.

107
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,600
I am just as bent as ever.
Hellishly so.

108
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:42,563
I shall taste those waters,
Master Gibbs. Mark my words.

109
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,358
Short trip.

110
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,329
All part of the plan, yes?

111
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,541
No.

112
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,049
You are Jack Sparrow?

113
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,760
There should be a "Captain"
in there somewhere.

114
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,430
I've heard of you.

115
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,640
And you know who I am.

116
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,227
Face is familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

117
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:49,148
You are in the presence of George
Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg,

118
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,151
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector
of the Holy Roman Empire,

119
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,696
King of Great Britain and Ireland,
and of you.

120
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,533
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- I am informed

121
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:04,121
you have come to London
to procure a crew for your ship.

122
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,415
Vicious rumor. Not true.

123
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,668
Then you lied to me when you
told me you were Jack Sparrow.

124
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,047
I am Jack Sparrow,
but I'm not here to procure a crew.

125
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,591
That is... someone else.

126
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,304
Someone else named Jack Sparrow.

127
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,223
You've brought me the wrong wastrel.

128
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,643
Find the proper one
and dispose of this impostor.

129
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,854
No, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute.

130
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,398
I'm Jack Sparrow, the one and only.

131
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,233
And I am in London.

132
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,444
To procure a crew.

133
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,279
To undertake a voyage

134
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,864
- to the Fountain...
- What?

135
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:43,577
Will someone please remove
these infernal chains?

136
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:44,870
Come, come.

137
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,750
We know you're in possession of a map.

138
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,045
So confiscate the map,
and to the gallows with him!

139
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,047
Have you a map?

140
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,429
- No.
- Where is it?

141
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:06,266
The truth? I lost it.

142
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,396
- Quite recently, in fact.
- I have a report.

143
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,149
The Spanish have located
the Fountain of Youth.

144
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:19,405
I will not have some
melancholy Spanish monarch,

145
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:24,159
a Catholic, gain eternal life!

146
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,664
You do know the way to the Fountain?

147
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,958
Of course I do.
Look at me.

148
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,960
You could guide an expedition.

149
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,631
With your permission, your heinie,

150
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,175
you will be providing, then, a ship...

151
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,429
...and a crew?

152
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,098
And a captain.

153
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,949
Afternoon, sire.

154
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,329
If I may be so bold,
why is that man not in chains?

155
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,373
He must be manacled at once.

156
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,127
At the center of my palace? Hardly.

157
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,421
Hector.

158
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,049
How nice to see a fellow pirate
make good of himself.

159
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,344
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

160
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:30,058
On a sanctioned mission under the
authority and protection of the Crown.

161
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,687
As may be, but first,

162
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,023
what has become of my beloved Pearl?

163
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,276
I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg.

164
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,695
- Lost the Pearl?
- Aye.

165
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:45,741
I defended her mightily enough,
but she be sunk nonetheless.

166
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,876
If that ship be sunk properly,
you should be sunk with it.

167
00:13:56,044 --> 00:14:01,298
Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry,
the Spanish outdistance us.

168
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,885
I have every confidence
you will prevail and be rewarded

169
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,346
with the high station you so desire.

170
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:12,267
- To serve doth suffice, sire.
- You, sir, have stooped.

171
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,729
Jack, our sands be all but run.

172
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:19,191
Where's the harm
in joining the winning side?

173
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:23,111
And you do meet
a nicer class of person.

174
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,656
I understand everything.

175
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,367
Except that wig.

176
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,834
He's getting away!
Stop him!

177
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,588
- Head him off!
- No! Stop that pirate!

178
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,570
Come down!

179
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,250
- He escaped?
- Leave it to me, sire.

180
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,092
Guards! Guards!

181
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,367
- Arms at ready!
- Aye, sir!

182
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,834
Find him!

183
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,566
Finders keepers!

184
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,942
There!

185
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,759
Is that it?

186
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,432
Halt! Stop that carriage!

187
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,850
Head him off!

188
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,486
Out of the way!

189
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,515
Stop that pirate!

190
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,227
Move out of the way!

191
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,193
Stop that man!

192
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,863
Don't let him get away!

193
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,122
Fire!

194
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,737
He's getting away!
After him! Stop him!

195
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,617
After him!

196
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,379
Filthy pirate.

197
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,642
Hello, Jackie.

198
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,854
Hello, Dad.

199
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,448
I heard you're putting together a crew.

200
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,451
If enough people keep saying it,
it must be true.

201
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,371
I heard where you're headed.
The Fountain.

202
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,997
Have you been there?

203
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,168
Does this face look like
it's been to the Fountain of Youth?

204
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,798
- Depends on the light.
- Son, the Fountain.

205
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,760
There'll be items required
for the profane ritual.

206
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,554
Two chalices.

207
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,724
- On the map there was a chalice.
- Two, silver.

208
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,727
From the Ponce de León ship.
You'll need both.

209
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,481
- For?
- The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.

210
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,693
Find out every detail
before you set sail.

211
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,695
Oh, set sail. Love to.

212
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,072
But for that, I may need a ship.

213
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,492
Those folk, over there,
they have a ship.

214
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,203
They're signing up sailors right now.

215
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,539
My heart is pierced by Cupid

216
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,666
I disdain all glittering gold

217
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,168
And one last thing, Jackie.

218
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,882
The Fountain will test you.
Mark my words.

219
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,341
My heart is pierced by Cupid

220
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,427
I disdain all glittering gold

221
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:23,305
There is nothing can console me

222
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,057
But myjolly sailor bold

223
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,406
I hear you be recruiting a crew.

224
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,617
Aye. That is,

225
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,537
Jack Sparrow be putting together
a modest venture.

226
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,625
You got some nerve, ain't ya?

227
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,293
Turning up here dressed like that?

228
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,420
What are you, some kind of impostor?

229
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,756
Have you any idea who I am, mate?

230
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,551
Oi, muckers!

231
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,304
There's a bloke here what's
forgotten his own name!

232
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,351
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.

233
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,269
Who'll buy a sailor a drink?

234
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:14,898
Who's next?

235
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:26,409
Bring us some more of those ones.

236
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,745
Yeah, make it four.

237
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:41,341
You've stolen me,
and I'm here to take meself back.

238
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,126
Stop doing that.

239
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,096
Only one person alive knows that move.

240
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,980
Always wanted to do that.

241
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,691
Hello, Angelica.

242
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:09,989
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?

243
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,326
I think I almost killed you
once or twice there.

244
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:17,539
I'm touched at this most
sincerest form of flattery.

245
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,209
But why?

246
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,003
You were the only pirate
I thought I would pass for.

247
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,880
That is not a compliment.

248
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,970
Don't worry, Jack.
I forgave you a long time ago.

249
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:37,267
- For what? For leaving you?
- Recall that I left you.

250
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:41,312
A gentleman allows a lady
to maintain her fictions.

251
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,983
Look, Sparrow. As long as
my sailors get their money,

252
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:49,154
they're willing to put up with
any number of peculiarities.

253
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,991
There is one peculiarity
with which I will not put up with.

254
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,703
I will be impersonated as "Captain."
Nothing less.

255
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,872
Well, for that, you need a ship,

256
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,499
and as it turns out, I have one.

257
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,377
I could use a ship.

258
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,255
I hear tell you've been to the Fountain.

259
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,549
There be a lot of hear-telling
going on these days.

260
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:14,220
- The Fountain of Youth.
- Dearest Angelica, fret not.

261
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,098
You still have a few usable years left.

262
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,602
Always so charming.

263
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,853
You didn't answer me.

264
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,564
Aye. Regarding the Fountain.
Waste of time, really...

265
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:28,318
Milady, I see unseamanlike fellows
of an officious-looking nature.

266
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,112
Wretched pirates!
Find 'em! Maggots!

267
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,492
Friends of yours?

268
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,287
I may have unintentionally
slighted some king or other.

269
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,206
Open it!

270
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,000
- Yeah, you haven't changed.
- Implying the need?

271
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,501
Yes.

272
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,337
Open this door,
in the name of His Majesty.

273
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,840
You betrayed me.
You seduced me and you used me.

274
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,717
I was innocent of the ways of men.

275
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,137
You demonstrated a lot of technique
for someone I supposedly corrupted.

276
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:59,057
Imminent danger. Here, now, milady!

277
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,767
Open it!

278
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:04,520
I was ready to take my vows. And you...

279
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,315
What were you doing in
a Spanish convent, anyway?

280
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,193
Mistook it for a brothel.
Honest mistake.

281
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,782
- There he is!
- Over there!

282
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,135
We are at a disadvantage.

283
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,681
Speak for yourself.
Unlike some who pretend to be,

284
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,599
but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,

285
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,184
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.

286
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,974
How can you say I used you?

287
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,310
You know exactly how.

288
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,563
I know, but how can you say it?

289
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,738
- So, what is it?
- What is what?

290
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,406
About the Fountain.

291
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,035
What do you know?

292
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:45,580
You don't happen to be in possession

293
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:48,958
of two silver chalices,
circa Ponce de León?

294
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,544
- No.
- Thought not.

295
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,298
- Why?
- I hear stories.

296
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,258
Rumors.

297
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,552
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.

298
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,596
Yes, I am.

299
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,684
What is it?
What is required?

300
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,274
A mermaid, Jack.

301
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,658
There's been a mistake.

302
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,329
It's a life sentence, not death. Life!

303
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:35,088
- Barbossa.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

304
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,216
I trust you can tie a noose.

305
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,759
That's a hard thing,

306
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,887
forcing a man to twist
his own hanging rope.

307
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,557
You must lie in your bed
the way you made it.

308
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,769
What's happened to you?

309
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:53,314
- Where be Jack Sparrow?
- He escaped.

310
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:54,899
I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs.

311
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,402
The HMS Providence
sets sail at first light.

312
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,695
If you do not care to watch it
hanging here dead,

313
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,864
with a mouth full of flies...

314
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,159
...speak now.

315
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,372
Take me with you.
Any point of the compass...

316
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,335
Take you where, Gibbs?
The Fountain? Aye?

317
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,505
Is that where Jack be headed?

318
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:21,676
Have you anything
you can offer me, Gibbs?

319
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,344
Anything at all?

320
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,641
Upon me naked word,
you'll not see the dawn.

321
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,401
Hand it over.

322
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,450
- You fool!
- I had just enough time

323
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,077
to study those infernal circles.

324
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:52,874
Every route, every destination.
All safe... in here.

325
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:58,379
Welcome back to His Majesty's navy,
Master Gibbs.

326
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,478
Show a leg, sailor!

327
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,854
Aye, sir.

328
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,690
What?

329
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:21,027
- There's been a horrible mistake.
- Keep moving.

330
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,490
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- Many a man's woken up at sea,

331
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,575
no idea what, when, wherefore or why.

332
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,952
No memory of the night afore,
whence he signed up

333
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,621
and drank away all his bonus money.

334
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,748
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate.

335
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,292
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
The original. The only.

336
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,003
Scrum, and the pleasure's all mine.
Now, keep moving.

337
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,971
Scrum.

338
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,349
Get your elbows in!

339
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,728
Why is there a glass coffin?

340
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,314
Do I look like a man in charge?

341
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,400
- Where am I?
- 'Scuse me, Captain Sparrow, sir.

342
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,194
I be right honored
to welcome you aboard

343
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:06,614
our world-renowned vessel of infamy,
Queen Anne's Revenge.

344
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,661
Blackbeard.

345
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,887
Work!

346
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,436
- He's a curious one.
- He's been zombiefied.

347
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,231
Zombiefied.

348
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,859
Blackbeard's doing.
All the officers are the same.

349
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,736
Makes 'em more compliant.

350
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,990
And perpetually ill-tempered.

351
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,286
- Come on. Scrub.
- Yeah.

352
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,005
Pull! Pull! Pull!

353
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,095
Five days underway, at least.

354
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:15,057
Aye. You can tell that
by the smell of the sea?

355
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,934
Smell of the crew.

356
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,608
Oi. What did that poor sod do?

357
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,776
And how can I make sure to not?

358
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,237
Him? Churchly fellow.

359
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,406
Always going on about the Lord Almighty.

360
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,283
Bible-thumper on this ship?

361
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,327
A missionary is his story.

362
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,204
What I heard was
he got captured in a raid.

363
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,207
Rest of the ship got killed,
but not 'im.

364
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,667
First mate wouldn't let it happen

365
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,503
on account of his premier standing
with the Lord.

366
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:49,050
A first mate sticking her neck out
for some prisoner.

367
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,801
That you don't see.

368
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,638
"Her"? First mate is a "her"?

369
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,014
Back to work!

370
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,567
Steady as she goes.

371
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:25,169
You are a ruthless,
soulless, cross-grained cur.

372
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,798
- I told you I had a ship.
- No, Blackbeard has a ship,

373
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,759
upon which I am now imprisoned.

374
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,886
We can do this, Jack.

375
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:38,599
The Fountain of Youth,
like you always wanted.

376
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:43,854
Blackbeard. Edward Teach.
The pirate all pirates fear.

377
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,148
Resurrector of the dead
in his spare time.

378
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,151
- He will listen to me.
- He listens to no one.

379
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,196
Maybe to his own daughter?

380
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,660
Daughter as in... beget by?

381
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:02,373
Long-lost. Recently found.

382
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:06,335
Who loves her dear papa
with all her soul.

383
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,546
- He bought that?
- I sold that.

384
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,805
Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him,

385
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,808
or him and you, not you and me.

386
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,018
No, Jack, that's the best part.

387
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,229
He will be dead.

388
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,941
You'll be handling
that part yourself, then?

389
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,318
There is a prophecy.

390
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,654
Maybe you don't believe
in the supernatural.

391
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,282
Oh, no, no.
I've seen a thing or two.

392
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:42,830
The prophecy is this:

393
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:46,792
Blackbeard will meet his death
within a fortnight

394
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,379
at the hands of a one-legged man.

395
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,715
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.

396
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,817
Master Gibbs, short we are a map.

397
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:15,029
Perhaps you'd be so kind
as to provide us an heading.

398
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,910
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.

399
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,497
Nay. We be privateers,
not pirates, Master Gibbs.

400
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,749
And in the king's name,
we behave as such.

401
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,710
Aye, Captain.

402
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,925
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?

403
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:40,679
Aye, it be proper. There's your proof.

404
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,479
The Spaniard.

405
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:54,777
All hands! Battle stations!
Get to windward!

406
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,988
- All hands, windward!
- Harden up two points!

407
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,575
- Two points!
- Cast loose the cannons!

408
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,291
- Gunners, take posts!
- Take position! Gunners ready, sir!

409
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:13,295
- Out! Thrust!
- Await orders.

410
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,757
Steady!

411
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,718
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.

412
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,061
Sir. Orders, sir?

413
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,404
He never so much as turned his head.

414
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,406
The Fountain is the prize.

415
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:44,159
It appears we be not even worth
the time it'd take to sink us.

416
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:48,205
And now we've fallen behind.
All hands, make more sail!

417
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,916
All hands, more sail!

418
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:54,378
Ride hard between wind and tide!

419
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,975
The topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.

420
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,519
Mutiny most foul.

421
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:14,189
Aye. I signed up to sail
under Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.

422
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,608
And a lady, at that.

423
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,943
And mention was failed to
be made of this uncanny crew.

424
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,446
Make my toes curl, they do.

425
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:23,657
I got 'em. All of them.

426
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,743
- Well done.
- Good lad.

427
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,329
On to it, then. Blackbeard.

428
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,915
- What are his habits?
- Stays mostly to his cabin.

429
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,834
That's right, mostly to his cabin.

430
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,171
- Yes, but when he comes out...
- He don't really come out.

431
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,507
He must come out sometime.

432
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,594
Not really, no.

433
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,139
Any of you sail with him before?

434
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,724
- No, no.
- I've never.

435
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:49,892
Definitely not.

436
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,896
- Any of you seen him before?
- Not really, no.

437
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,691
Stays to his cabin,
no one sailed with him,

438
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,860
no one's seen him...

439
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,030
Good news, gentlemen.
This is not Blackbeard's ship.

440
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,990
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.

441
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,159
No, this be the Queen Anne's Revenge,
right enough.

442
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:08,744
How do you know?

443
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:12,164
I've seen the name,
on the back of the ship.

444
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:20,381
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

445
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,218
...you have been monstrously deceived.

446
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:28,514
- We are decepted, then?
- Yes.

447
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:31,558
You've nay been informed
of a destination.

448
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,852
Death lies before us

449
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,816
as we sail for the Fountain of Youth.

450
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,319
It would be a sorry plight, mates.

451
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:46,573
- Death, for certain.
- The garden of darkened souls.

452
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,077
- Untimely our ends will be.
- Unless...

453
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,746
...we take the ship.

454
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:57,584
We take the ship, then. Now!

455
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,340
Go on, then.

456
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,760
- Help me, shipmates!
- Give it to 'em!

457
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,138
- Wake up! It's ours!
- Come on!

458
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,931
Get up! Off your backside!

459
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,852
- Get off your fannies!
- Take it to them, lads!

460
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,812
Help me! Fight!

461
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,785
Jack.

462
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:38,042
If this is a dream,
you can keep the sword and boots on.

463
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,713
- If it's not...
- It's a dream.

464
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,386
No, it's not!

465
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,265
I thought I should give you
fair warning, we're taking the ship.

466
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,809
Nothing personal.

467
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,771
Think you might be better off
if you just...

468
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,732
...stay out of it.

469
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,632
Boggit.

470
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,530
Wretch!

471
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,145
You're either with us or against us!

472
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,480
I am not with you,
neither am I against you!

473
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,982
Can he do that?

474
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,152
He's religious.
I believe it's required.

475
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,785
Fight to the bitter end,
you cack-handed deck apes!

476
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,008
Take him, men.
Tie him down tight!

477
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,482
The ship is ours!

478
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,555
Gentlemen.

479
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:49,483
I be placed in a bewilderment.

480
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:54,279
There I were, resting,

481
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:59,076
and upon a sudden,
I hear an ungodly row on deck.

482
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,081
Sailors abandon their posts

483
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,750
without orders, without leave.

484
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:11,088
Men before the mast,

485
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:13,632
taking the ship for themselves.

486
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,678
What be that, First Mate?

487
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,681
- Mutiny, Captain.
- Again?

488
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,809
- Mutiny!
- Aye.

489
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,061
Mutiny.

490
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,025
And what fate befalls mutineers?

491
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:35,696
Now, we know the answer to that,
do we not?

492
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,408
Mutineers hang!

493
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,959
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.

494
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,087
I can name fingers and point names.

495
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,714
No need, Mr. Sparrow.

496
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:39,092
They are sheep. You, their shepherd.

497
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,683
Have I mentioned, sir,
what a lovely daughter you have?

498
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,770
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

499
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,314
Remember, Father.
We need him.

500
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:53,940
If I don't kill a man
every now and then,

501
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,485
- they forget who I am.
- Coward!

502
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,280
They do not forget.

503
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,824
Your crew sees you
for the miscreant you are.

504
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,285
A coward, no matter how many you slay.

505
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,829
Twice in one day,
I find myself in a bewilderment.

506
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,123
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.

507
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,126
You dare not walk the path of
righteousness, the way of the light.

508
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:17,506
No, sir. The truth is
it be much simpler than all that.

509
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,550
- I am a bad man.
- That, too.

510
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,677
I might have to kill you too, catechist.

511
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,430
- No!
- All Latin blood like her mother.

512
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,641
Father, I beg you.

513
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:31,520
There I be again,
forgetting why the missionary is here.

514
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:36,066
My daughter fears for my soul,
or what's left of it.

515
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,737
You truly wish to save me, my child?

516
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,823
Every soul can be saved.

517
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,742
Be that true, young cleric?

518
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,579
Yes. Though you I see
as a bit of a long shot.

519
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:54,543
Still, I pray for every unfortunate soul
on this hell-bound vessel.

520
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,756
You disarm me with your faith.

521
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,592
Eight bells!

522
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,720
Which of you unfortunate souls
stood watch?

523
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:10,851
- I did. I stood watch.
- Gunner.

524
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:17,607
You?

525
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:22,237
Aye.

526
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,364
The cook.

527
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,367
Perfect. Lower the longboat!

528
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,624
Bring her about!

529
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,222
- Why do you do this?
- Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

530
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,641
Our laws allow the Captain
to show leniency.

531
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,394
I have given this man
a chance to determine his fate,

532
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,229
a gift not afforded to all.

533
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,781
Oh, you now.

534
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,702
Chance to show the worth
of your prayers.

535
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,915
Pray he be delivered from... evil?

536
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,591
Course made!

537
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,593
Stop. Give that man a chance.
Give yourself a...

538
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,913
You know when I feel closest
to our Maker?

539
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,915
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.

540
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,584
That's when the true design
of this world is revealed.

541
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:03,421
And I see it revealed when in times
of hardship and tragedy,

542
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,840
kindness and compassion
are shown to those in need.

543
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,385
Perhaps you should pray
for him to be unharmed, yes?

544
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,720
- Please, there's still hope...
- Again!

545
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,027
I actually have no interest
in the Fountain whatsoever,

546
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:28,029
so, if your heart is set,

547
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,365
you may drop me off
anywhere you like.

548
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,284
That'll be all, Quartermaster.

549
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,790
Your words surround you like fog
and make you hard to see.

550
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:42,752
And what of you,
the mighty Blackbeard?

551
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,672
Beheaded they say.
Still, your body swam

552
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,259
three times around your ship,
then climbed back onboard.

553
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,012
And here you are, running scared.

554
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,057
- Scared.
- To the Fountain.

555
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:59,227
The Quartermaster
sees things before they happen.

556
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:03,857
He has foreseen my death,
and so the fates have spoken.

557
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:06,359
The threads of destiny woven.

558
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:09,446
You have a ridiculously
high regard for fate, mate.

559
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,197
- And you?
- Me?

560
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:15,619
I'm skeptical of predicting
any future... which includes me.

561
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:21,541
It'd be foolish to battle fate,
but I'd be tempted to cheat it.

562
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,544
I will reach the Fountain.
You will lead me.

563
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:31,009
That knife will serve you no better
than the mutiny you devised.

564
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,927
Mutiny served me well.

565
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,013
It gained me an audience with you.

566
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:38,224
Aye.

567
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,436
To warn you.

568
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,980
Regarding your first mate,

569
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:47,025
who pretends to be persons she is not.

570
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:48,652
Do tell.

571
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,031
She is not your daughter.

572
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,371
You dare to speak
thusly of my flesh and blood?

573
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:04,042
Sir, the woman is consummate
in the art of deception.

574
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:08,630
I know. As I mostly unwittingly
set her on her wicked path.

575
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:10,715
Though I cannot claim credit

576
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:13,802
for her existing abundance
of natural talent.

577
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,306
Angelica.
My beloved daughter,

578
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:21,059
the one true good thing
I have done in this life,

579
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:23,853
and you claim to be the one
who corrupted her?

580
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:28,024
Sir, what she is is pure evil.

581
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,568
More to be feared than a wild beast.

582
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:34,531
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.

583
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:36,700
Vengeful, hungry from hell beast...

584
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,993
- Father?
- Sweetness!

585
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,497
No need to hurt him, Father.

586
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:45,875
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

587
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,754
You see? Even now,
she attends to your welfare,

588
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:53,466
giving lie to the claims
you make of her.

589
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:05,520
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?

590
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,022
Put another way.

591
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:12,235
If I do not make it
to the Fountain in time...

592
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,865
...neither will you.

593
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:23,163
I'll have a wee look-see at those charts
straight away then, shall I?

594
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,168
Sir.

595
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,381
- Aye?
- Captain, sir,

596
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:35,925
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

597
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,261
among the crew,
as to our destination.

598
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:41,431
Shut your trap and make way.

599
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:49,063
- That's the way of it, then.
- No disrespect, sir.

600
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:52,692
What do the men fear?
Say it. Speak the words.

601
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:54,778
Whitecap Bay.

602
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,031
Aye, Whitecap Bay.

603
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:02,243
And every worthless seaman
fears the name, and rightly so,

604
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,746
though few know why or dare to ask.

605
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:06,539
Be the stories true?

606
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,500
Say what robs you of
your staunch heart, Gibbs,

607
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,795
or forever leave it
to the wider fields of fancy.

608
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,090
Mermaids, Captain.

609
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,009
Aye. Mermaids.

610
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:22,305
Sea ghouls, devil fish,
dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.

611
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:26,017
Mermaid waters, that be our path.

612
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:27,727
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

613
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:31,523
as mermaids be given
to take the rest...

614
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,066
...to the bone.

615
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,779
Steady! Steady, men!
Find your courage,

616
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,823
or be ready to purpose your fear!

617
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,367
Save yourselves!

618
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,789
- Man overboard!
- Nay! A deserter.

619
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:49,707
- Come about.
- Nay!

620
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,796
Gentlemen, I shall not ask
any more of any man than what

621
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:59,425
that man can deliver, but I do ask this:
Are we not king's men?

622
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,010
Aye.

623
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,930
- On the king's mission?
- Aye.

624
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:08,309
I did not note any fear in the eyes
of the Spanish as they passed us by.

625
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:11,187
- Are we not king's men?
- Aye!

626
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,274
Aye! Hands all off, and bear away!

627
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,360
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay!

628
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,364
Bear on, Whitecap Bay!

629
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,838
Come.

630
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,298
Little drink?

631
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,676
Wine, music, candlelight.

632
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,053
I think we've traveled down
this road before, Jack.

633
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,014
Yes, we have.

634
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:48,391
I remember it well.

635
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:55,064
Winding, twisting and
turning, gyrating, writhing.

636
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,525
Incessant writhing.

637
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,527
Do you recall Saint Dominique?

638
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,530
La Martinique.

639
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,365
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.

640
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,284
Either or.

641
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,120
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

642
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:12,707
Was I the first? I've often wondered.

643
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:17,086
You can be so charming
when you want something, Jack.

644
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,714
The trick is finding out what.

645
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,926
The truth, then, is it?

646
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,137
Blackbeard has served his purpose.

647
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:28,598
You and I can go to
the Fountain together,

648
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,809
where we shall bathe one another
in equal shares of fame

649
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,978
and other assorted debaucheries.

650
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:37,106
And I'll tell you
the ritual of the Fountain.

651
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,068
Yes. The profane ritual.

652
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,989
Can I trust you, Jack?

653
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:49,535
- I need you on my side.
- Oh, my dearest Angelica.

654
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:53,122
You and I are as
thick as thieves, love.

655
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,500
Tell me the rules.

656
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,297
Water from the Fountain of Youth.

657
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:06,552
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.

658
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,014
The silver chalices of Ponce de León.

659
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,685
With these items...

660
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,937
- Yes?
- With these items,

661
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:19,482
you may take all the years
of life from another, Jack.

662
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,569
You know what that means.

663
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,614
We cannot go alone, you and I.

664
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:29,033
The ritual requires a victim.

665
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:34,622
- That is unfortunate.
- Yes, it is.

666
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,501
I find my desire for the Fountain
greatly lessened.

667
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,547
But there is something onboard
you do want.

668
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,679
What about Blackbeard?

669
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:53,433
He's in the chart room.
We'll have to be quick.

670
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:05,111
He keeps each ship as a prize.

671
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:11,325
You help me,
and I promise you your pick.

672
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,871
Though I think I know the one
you will choose.

673
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,254
The Black Pearl in a bottle?

674
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,131
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?

675
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,765
He's even more annoying in miniature.

676
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:37,935
- Do we have a deal, Jack?
- Angelica, I know you.

677
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,938
You are not going to steal the life
of some innocent man.

678
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,816
What about the one-legged man?

679
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,695
I need years, Jack.

680
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,950
Not for me. For my father.

681
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,872
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

682
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,084
You've fallen for your own con, love.

683
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,503
No, he is my father.

684
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,338
The lies I told you were not lies.

685
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:10,009
You lied to me by telling me the truth?

686
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,178
- Yes.
- That's very good.

687
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,764
- May I use that?
- I'm sure you will, anyway.

688
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:17,266
Of course I will.

689
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,103
So, will you not give up this quest?

690
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:23,856
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.

691
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:28,361
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...

692
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,280
...he is evil,

693
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,616
and he will kill you given the chance.

694
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,869
- He cannot be saved.
- And who are you to set

695
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,205
the limits on redemption?

696
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,667
You stole years of my life, Jack.
You owe me.

697
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:45,878
And you are en route
to getting yourself killed,

698
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,339
and I am not inclined
to stand by and watch.

699
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:52,218
Whitecap Bay!

700
00:57:57,349 --> 00:58:00,726
All hands on deck!
Set to the longboats!

701
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,815
Lay 'em out flat!

702
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:11,279
No tangles. Make 'em look
pretty for our dainty guests.

703
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:15,241
We're gonna need light.
A lot of light.

704
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,035
Come!

705
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:45,062
Smell that? Whale oil.
Stuff burns like a miracle from God.

706
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,941
- Can you make it work?
- Made by the English.

707
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,193
Let's not get our hopes up.

708
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,164
The old moon in
the arms of the new one.

709
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:04,540
First of the summer.

710
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:08,669
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

711
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,852
We're doomed.
They be drawn to man-made light.

712
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,688
- Sharks?
- Worse than sharks, boy.

713
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,358
There'll be mermaids upon us
within the hour,

714
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,986
you mark my words.
And we're the bait.

715
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:42,286
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid
protects a sailor from drowning.

716
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:46,290
Don't be a fool!
Mermaids are all female, son,

717
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,210
and lovely as a dream of heaven.

718
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:53,631
But when it comes time
to churn butter, so to speak,

719
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,758
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

720
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:58,928
or off the deck of a ship,
have their way,

721
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:04,016
and then the sailors are pulled
to bottom and drowned and eaten.

722
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:07,895
Or, sometimes, the other way around.

723
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:11,816
- Sing.
- What?

724
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:15,319
They like to hear singing.

725
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,244
My name is Maria

726
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:26,539
A merchant's daughter fair

727
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:30,293
- Louder.
- And I have left my parents

728
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,629
And 3,000 pounds a year

729
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,799
My heart is pierced by Cupid

730
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:40,386
I disdain all glittering gold

731
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:44,015
There is nothing can console me

732
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,059
But myjolly sailor bold

733
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:52,773
My heart is pierced by Cupid

734
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:56,610
I disdain all glittering gold

735
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,488
There is nothing can console me

736
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:04,118
But myjolly sailor bold

737
01:01:22,054 --> 01:01:23,554
Lord save me.

738
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:30,269
Man, look. Look there.

739
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,229
You'll scare her off!

740
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:33,898
Aye, and good riddance!

741
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,571
Can you talk?

742
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,784
Yes.

743
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,793
You're beautiful.

744
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:58,381
- Are you the one who sings?
- Aye.

745
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:03,719
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

746
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,182
- Aye, that I be.
- Scrum, comport yourself!

747
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,519
Boys! There ain't much
been given to me

748
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,063
in my brief, miserable life,
there's the truth in it.

749
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,940
But, by God, I'll have it said

750
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:19,485
that Scrum had himself a kiss
from a proper mermaid!

751
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,365
My heart is pierced by Cupid

752
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:28,035
I disdain all glittering gold

753
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,580
There is nothing can console me

754
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,835
But myjolly sailor bold

755
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:40,840
Come all ye pretty fair maids

756
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:45,219
Whoever you may be

757
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:48,931
Who love a jolly sailor bold

758
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:53,811
That ploughs the raging sea

759
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:58,065
My heart is pierced by Cupid

760
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:02,403
I disdain all glittering gold

761
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:06,740
There is nothing can console me

762
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:11,245
But myjolly sailor bold

763
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:16,542
My heart is pierced by Cupid

764
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,920
I disdain all glittering gold

765
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:24,133
There is nothing can console me

766
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:28,095
But myjolly sailor bold

767
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:07,259
Out upon it! It has begun!

768
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,011
Light 'em up!

769
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:55,724
Muster your courage!
Drive 'em to shore!

770
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:09,613
Nets into the water! Quickly!

771
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:02,499
Retreat, all, to land!
For your lives!

772
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,254
Retreat, I say!

773
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,423
Cowards! Back in the water!

774
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:13,761
There be no refuge on land! On my word!

775
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,420
Come on!

776
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:25,184
We got one!

777
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:30,814
I'm in love!

778
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:34,985
Check the wounded!

779
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:37,905
See if you can find
one mermaid still alive!

780
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:18,362
Come, give a hand!

781
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,615
Well done, sailor.

782
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:24,243
Did everyone see that?

783
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,411
Because I will not be doing it again.

784
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:31,250
Back to the ship.
We head for a protected cove. Now.

785
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:51,019
- Lord. Is that?
- Mermaid.

786
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,690
- Give up this madness now.
- I cannot.

787
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:56,608
Ever walk on the beach,

788
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:59,027
look back and see your footsteps
in the sand?

789
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:03,156
It's like that,
except the footsteps lie before me.

790
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:07,119
- Footstep, actually.
- Whitecap Bay, sir.

791
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:08,871
We must hasten.

792
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:20,549
We travel by foot.
Gibbs, I require a heading.

793
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,844
- But, sir, the men.
- They be dead already.

794
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:27,097
- They don't sound dead.
- Oh, is that so?

795
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:31,560
Well, I hear nothing
but seagulls nesting.

796
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,770
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?

797
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:40,235
Seagulls... nesting.

798
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:43,447
- Nothing more.
- Heading, Gibbs?

799
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:53,665
My God.

800
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,834
Your head or my heading.

801
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,170
I'll have me one or t'other,
I don't care which.

802
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,636
All hands, forward!

803
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:25,572
- It's to you now, Sparrow.
- Was that really necessary?

804
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,367
Best you not know the exact
whereabouts of my ship.

805
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:33,205
- I be a cautious man.
- So be I.

806
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:35,082
What I want first...

807
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,712
...is Ponce De León's ship.

808
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,626
Why is it we've got to bring her along?

809
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:23,005
Because tears don't keep.
We need them fresh.

810
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,882
What is the ritual again?

811
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,468
Water from the Fountain
and a mermaid's tear?

812
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,137
And two silver chalices.

813
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,931
One cup with a tear, one without.

814
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:36,601
So, one with a tear and water in both?

815
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,270
Quite complicated, is it not?

816
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:41,481
Both get water. One gets a tear.

817
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:44,276
The person who drinks
the water with the tear

818
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:46,903
gets all the years of life
from the other.

819
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:50,157
How many years?

820
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,578
All the years
that they have lived,

821
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:58,248
and they could have lived,
if fate had been kinder.

822
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:08,842
Clergyman.

823
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:13,764
On the off chance that this
does not go well for me,

824
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:15,474
I would like it noted here and now

825
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,852
that I am fully prepared
to believe in whatever I must,

826
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,771
so that I may be
welcomed into that place

827
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:23,315
where all the goody-goodies
get to go. Savvy?

828
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:27,110
We have a word for that, Jack.
You can convert.

829
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:29,738
I was thinking more
of an as-needed basis.

830
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:34,993
Quartermaster!

831
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,329
- Aye?
- She cannot breathe!

832
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:40,540
- She has water.
- She needs air!

833
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:46,421
- Open this.
- She will escape.

834
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:50,300
- You're killing her.
- I support the missionary's position.

835
01:13:58,851 --> 01:13:59,893
See?

836
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,650
Onward.

837
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:34,302
Just as I thought. Not this way!

838
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,806
This is the way, isn't it?

839
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:40,767
'Course it is, but we
should go around to the east.

840
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:42,769
That would take us out of
the path of the chalices.

841
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,688
- Well, then we'll circle back.
- There is no time.

842
01:14:44,856 --> 01:14:46,481
You're the one who insisted
on bringing the bloody mermaid.

843
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,608
- Well, the mutiny didn't help.
- You walk like a girl.

844
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,861
- You would know.
- Someone must go.

845
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:53,446
You mean split up?

846
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:56,491
You mean jump?
This I cannot wait to see.

847
01:14:56,659 --> 01:15:00,579
Sparrow will go.
Find the ship, retrieve the chalices.

848
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,747
Sparrow? What makes you
think he will come back?

849
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,126
Yes, what makes you think
he will come back?

850
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:08,753
We cannot trust him, Father. I'll go.

851
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,339
She'll go.

852
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:16,720
How much farther to the Fountain?

853
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:18,555
I'm running out of time.

854
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:22,684
About a day's march north,
following that river,

855
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:26,313
you'll get to a series of pools.
Then you're close.

856
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:30,066
You will go.

857
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:35,280
I was sure it would come to this.

858
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:53,006
You know that feeling you get sometimes
when you're standing in a high place?

859
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,091
Sudden urge to jump?

860
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:58,553
I don't have it.

861
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,473
I need those chalices.

862
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:04,100
Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.

863
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:07,312
You will go. You will return...

864
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:10,607
...or I will kill her.

865
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:14,945
You won't kill your own daughter.

866
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,864
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols,

867
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,616
remove the shot from all but two,

868
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:22,244
but do not tell me which two.

869
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:27,123
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.

870
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:34,339
No.

871
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:40,262
- Yes.
- You're sure?

872
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,846
'Course I am.

873
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,147
Again.

874
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:55,193
Please, they're not even loaded.

875
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:01,408
Again.

876
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:04,160
If you're so keen on killing her,

877
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:06,705
- why don't you just let herjump?
- What?

878
01:17:07,498 --> 01:17:09,958
If you jump and die,

879
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:13,753
then she will have her chance.

880
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:15,380
Again.

881
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,510
Oi...

882
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:24,514
...if I jump, will I survive?

883
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,184
The doll.

884
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:49,247
- Yes, now you will survive.
- This is nonsense! I'm going!

885
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:11,227
Wet. Wet again.

886
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:16,441
We go on.
Due north to the Fountain.

887
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:18,610
Well played, Father.

888
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:22,697
You knew which guns were loaded, right?

889
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:27,410
Of course, my love.

890
01:18:37,088 --> 01:18:39,798
Be nice to have a map about now.

891
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,591
Or a ship.

892
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:46,054
Stop! Hold very still.

893
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:51,017
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.

894
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:02,987
What? What be wrong with
an older man having a hobby?

895
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,657
What are you stopping for, eh? Push on!

896
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:07,992
- Push on!
- You can sleep when you're dead.

897
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,327
Push on!

898
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:14,290
Fortune continues to favor us.

899
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,279
The Santiago.

900
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:47,157
Famously captained by Ponce de León.

901
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:51,369
There's no one there.

902
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:52,537
Right, then.

903
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,615
We must not stop.

904
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,416
You will walk.

905
01:20:57,603 --> 01:20:59,729
I cannot.

906
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,648
Walk or die.

907
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:09,322
Put your arms around me.

908
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:12,867
- I do not ask for help.
- But you need it.

909
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:34,097
- We're in a hurry, yes?
- Do not fall behind.

910
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,159
Hold here 'til I say!

911
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,091
Such beauty.

912
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:13,553
Surely you're one of
God's own creations,

913
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:16,639
and not a descendant
of those dark creatures

914
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:19,058
who found no refuge on the Ark.

915
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,980
Such beauty...

916
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:26,858
...and yet deadly.

917
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:31,321
- Deadly? No.
- You attacked me.

918
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:36,409
No. You are different.

919
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,536
Different?

920
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:42,707
Are you not? You protect.

921
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:47,170
Did you?

922
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:51,591
You pushed me down out of the way.

923
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:57,221
- You see the Fountain?
- No, but we are close.

924
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,641
Bring the creature.
Cover its head.

925
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,768
She has a name!

926
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:07,815
Pray tell.

927
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:15,907
She is Syrena.

928
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,408
Ponce de León.

929
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:05,790
If 40 pirates
dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

930
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:09,502
it would not match
the contents of this room.

931
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:11,212
You.

932
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,800
- You.
- No...

933
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:19,220
...you.
- I was here first.

934
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:23,391
- You, why are you here?
- Blackbeard sent me.

935
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:26,018
- Why are you?
- Silver chalices

936
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:29,522
- for my royal liege.
- Oh, please.

937
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:32,567
Back, back! We have to balance it out!

938
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,155
The whole ship will slide!

939
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:42,535
Right, then.

940
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:48,624
What ifwe each choose an item
of approximately equal weight?

941
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:52,712
Put it back!

942
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,299
We touch nothing!

943
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:05,183
What about that?

944
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,685
The chalices.

945
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:10,938
Oi! Why do you get to look first?

946
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,774
Fine, then.

947
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:33,586
- Together.
- Together.

948
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,340
Rocks.

949
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:39,759
The Spanish.

950
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:42,178
They're ahead of us, mate.

951
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:46,349
I shall have a look at that map.
If it's what I fear...

952
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:58,653
I wonder why they left this behind.

953
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:05,409
Don't touch the map.

954
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:11,874
They know the path,

955
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:15,920
but I can also see where
they'll most likely make camp.

956
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:30,685
Jack!

957
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:38,025
Gibbs, I was just on me way
to break you out ofjail.

958
01:26:39,987 --> 01:26:41,487
You stole my map.

959
01:26:42,072 --> 01:26:44,490
Right. Best be started.

960
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:49,078
Olé.

961
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:07,972
Mermaids.

962
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:13,728
Careful, these pools run deep.

963
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:17,440
If she escapes, all is lost.
Quartermaster.

964
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:22,361
Look. Look!

965
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:26,908
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.

966
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:30,661
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live,

967
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:34,999
butjust enough to make the dying slow.

968
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,209
Think on it.

969
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:40,755
Your people, murdered,
harvested for their tears.

970
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:45,217
Syrena, won't you cry?

971
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:47,929
All die, even you.

972
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:51,515
- Soon, I hear.
- Listen...

973
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:55,436
Listen.

974
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:58,898
Can you not hear your sisters scream?

975
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:01,484
Do you not hear them?

976
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:05,321
We need but one tear.

977
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,492
Vile creature!

978
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:12,203
- Chop off her fingers, one by one!
- Choke her!

979
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:14,956
Cut out the tears
from behind the eyes!

980
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:16,415
Where's your voice in this?

981
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:20,336
Maybe she'll have a change of heart
when the sun rises.

982
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:24,382
Oh, aye, she will burn,
but I cannot wait for the sun.

983
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:26,217
Perhaps we should build a fire.

984
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,511
- No.
- Do not contest me, cleric.

985
01:28:28,679 --> 01:28:31,722
- You will not torture her.
- We need only one tear.

986
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:35,017
I will tear every scale
from her body one by one if I see fit.

987
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:36,727
If that displeases you, go pray.

988
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:39,981
I was wrong. Not every soul
can be saved. Yours cannot.

989
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,984
Behold, gentlemen,
a man formerly of faith.

990
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:46,028
That vile creature, as you call her,
is worth a hundred of you.

991
01:28:46,196 --> 01:28:47,905
Oh, you care for her?

992
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,951
You fancy her.

993
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:56,372
And do not deny what is
clear to my eyes.

994
01:28:58,208 --> 01:28:59,291
Question is...

995
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:04,463
...does she fancy you?

996
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:10,302
By God, she does. We are in luck!

997
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,597
Bring forth a tear...

998
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:17,643
...or witness the death
of this poor soul.

999
01:29:19,813 --> 01:29:23,232
Syrena, if you could manage a tear,

1000
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,942
I would be grateful.

1001
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:27,903
Sadness, yes,

1002
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:33,451
- but no sorrow... yet.
- Not by your hand, Father!

1003
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:36,245
Time and tide wait for none.
Quartermaster.

1004
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:52,053
Aye, mermaids are tough.

1005
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,221
The lot of them.

1006
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:58,768
Tie her up like the others.
And get rid of this.

1007
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:06,317
- You are confident?
- Yes.

1008
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:09,445
I am a woman. So is she.

1009
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:20,498
What's your play, Jack?
Throwing in with Barbossa.

1010
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:23,334
There is a girl...

1011
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:26,670
...a female... of the opposite sex.

1012
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:30,758
- When is there not?
- Perhaps I should say "damsel."

1013
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:33,928
You're rescuing a damsel?
Well, there's a first.

1014
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:37,306
Yes, but it's just that
I may have caused said damsel

1015
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:41,018
- some manner of harm many moons ago.
- Out with it.

1016
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:44,480
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.

1017
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:48,526
Ah, you pretended to love her,
then you left her and broke her heart.

1018
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:53,364
Worse. I may have had,
briefly, mind you...

1019
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,702
...stirrings.
- Stirrings?

1020
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:02,832
- Stirrings.
- What? Like feelings, you mean?

1021
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:06,001
No, no, no. Not quite all the way
to feelings. More like...

1022
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:11,715
All right, feelings, damn you.

1023
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:16,554
And you left her still.
That's low.

1024
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:19,223
Thank you.

1025
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:27,565
Stealth over force.

1026
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:31,443
I'll take it from here
on account of your condition.

1027
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:34,446
You don't have termites, do you?

1028
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:36,574
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

1029
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:39,243
but I'll be keeping
you company all the same.

1030
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:42,454
Hold here, Lieutenant Commander.
Wait for my signal.

1031
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:16,530
There. That one.
That be the leader.

1032
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:19,158
Make note of his tent
because that's where...

1033
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:24,872
No, wait. By God,
that must be them right there.

1034
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:30,628
Your sword smells funny.

1035
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:35,674
Aye. Poison from the
innards of poisonous toads.

1036
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:38,928
Just a scratch,
you're a dead man in minutes.

1037
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:41,388
Would you mind pointing it
the other way?

1038
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,307
I don't like toads.

1039
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:51,607
- What are you doing?
- Planning an escape route.

1040
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:55,819
- Isn't that how you do it?
- Yes.

1041
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:59,073
Or sometimes I just... improvise.

1042
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:27,559
Now what?

1043
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:30,980
We stroll out, slow and steady.

1044
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:32,940
Just like we belong.

1045
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:36,628
- I'm sorry, Syrena.
- Philip, you're alive.

1046
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:40,966
- Yes.
- You came for me.

1047
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:44,345
Why?

1048
01:34:46,473 --> 01:34:48,766
You're different, are you not?

1049
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:55,314
Do you know not of kindness?
Compassion?

1050
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,500
Tears of sorrow, never.

1051
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:17,086
Mermaids be too tough for that.

1052
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:19,380
But tears ofjoy...

1053
01:35:20,924 --> 01:35:23,300
They say these be
the more potent anyway.

1054
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:26,428
Syrena, on my word,
I had no part in this.

1055
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:29,139
Let her go.
You don't need her now.

1056
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:32,226
Let her go? No.

1057
01:35:32,394 --> 01:35:35,354
Secure her bonds.
We leave her with her own.

1058
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:46,907
How's that escape route working?

1059
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:49,993
Here's your chance to improvise.

1060
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,453
I'm attempting it.

1061
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:54,415
I might be able to get a hand loose.

1062
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,834
Oh, you got a knife.
That's very good.

1063
01:35:57,961 --> 01:35:59,461
Better.

1064
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:06,176
I want one of those.

1065
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:15,102
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.

1066
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:19,690
- Revenge?
- Come, come, Hector.

1067
01:36:19,858 --> 01:36:21,233
If you wanted the chalices,

1068
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:24,069
you'd seen they were missing and gone.

1069
01:36:24,237 --> 01:36:27,364
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.

1070
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:32,578
King George. Privateer. Wig.

1071
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:35,164
Cheap theatrical facade.

1072
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:38,167
- I'm not buying it.
- You weren't there that night.

1073
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:42,129
- When the Pearlwas lost?
- Taken, not lost.

1074
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:48,886
We were off the coast of Hispaniola
when we came under attack.

1075
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:52,473
No provocation nor warning
nor offer of parley.

1076
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,267
We were peppered with cannon fire.

1077
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:59,646
And then the sea beneath
the Pearl began to roil.

1078
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,609
The Pearlwas pitching
and yawing violently.

1079
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:05,611
Every plank, every rail,

1080
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:08,614
every spar, all at once,
began to creak.

1081
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,783
The rigging had come to life.

1082
01:37:11,951 --> 01:37:14,620
Our own ship turned against us...

1083
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:18,040
...tangling the crew,
wrapping around 'em like snakes.

1084
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:20,584
And wrapping around me leg.

1085
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:23,128
But me arms were free
and me sword was to hand.

1086
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:26,798
I am the master of me ship,
not Blackbeard.

1087
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:30,427
I am the master of my fate,
not Blackbeard.

1088
01:37:31,471 --> 01:37:33,805
So I did what needed done.

1089
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,606
I survived.

1090
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:48,362
So... you're not after the Fountain.

1091
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:52,157
I care not for King George
or tavern yarns

1092
01:37:52,325 --> 01:37:54,535
that give hope for a healed limb.

1093
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:59,831
But I'd give my left arm
for a chance at Blackbeard.

1094
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:03,001
- Not your right?
- I need me good arm

1095
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:07,798
to drive my poisoned blade
through his heart.

1096
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,218
I'll see you get the chance, mate.

1097
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:31,298
The prisoner's escaping.

1098
01:39:38,598 --> 01:39:41,266
He's escaping!
Fan out! Find him!

1099
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:42,517
Go! Go!

1100
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:47,439
Hold your fire! I want him alive!

1101
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:57,616
I figured that was the signal.

1102
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:44,204
- Go! Prepare to move out!
- The enemy is soon upon us.

1103
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:48,875
I'm sorry about the chalices, Jack,
but I've an appointment to keep.

1104
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:52,003
- I'll not be going back.
- No need.

1105
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:55,173
- Shall we have a drink?
- We'll drink at the Fountain.

1106
01:41:13,568 --> 01:41:17,112
How is it we can never meet
without you pointing something at me?

1107
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:20,198
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?

1108
01:41:20,366 --> 01:41:22,951
Aye. Oi!

1109
01:41:26,456 --> 01:41:29,541
- I see you brought a friend.
- I did.

1110
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:32,919
And the one-legged man, he is near.
Aye?

1111
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:34,463
Aye.

1112
01:41:35,298 --> 01:41:36,298
Now...

1113
01:41:36,466 --> 01:41:39,259
Before I go just handing them over,
I do have one or two conditions.

1114
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:41,470
- Name them.
- Firstly,

1115
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,972
I'll be having me compass back.
No, no, that's secondly.

1116
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:46,349
Firstly, upon your word,

1117
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:48,477
you will bring no harm to Angelica.

1118
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:50,979
I'll make no vows
to the likes of you, Sparrow.

1119
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:53,565
But it costs me nothing to admit

1120
01:41:53,733 --> 01:41:56,568
that she was never in harm's way.

1121
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:59,404
Secondly then, priorly firstly,

1122
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:01,198
I will be having me compass back.

1123
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,117
Please? I do deserve it.

1124
01:42:04,285 --> 01:42:07,746
Do you have any idea how difficult
it was to catch that filthy pig?

1125
01:42:07,914 --> 01:42:10,248
Not the big one,
the four-legged one.

1126
01:42:13,711 --> 01:42:17,464
Thank you. And thirdly, Mr. Beard,

1127
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:20,300
there are times, not very often,

1128
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:23,553
when I do reflect
upon my heinous misdeeds.

1129
01:42:23,721 --> 01:42:27,974
Chief among them, I note how poorly
I have treated Mr. Gibbs,

1130
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:30,769
- my loyal first mate.
- Aye! Now you bring it up...

1131
01:42:30,937 --> 01:42:33,605
Left him to rot in jail, I did.
Didn't care.

1132
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:38,401
Still don't. But, point being,
you must let him go free.

1133
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:43,615
- Is that it?
- I think so.

1134
01:42:43,783 --> 01:42:46,368
Quick, or the pig runs,
and good luck getting those chalices.

1135
01:42:46,536 --> 01:42:47,953
Jack, if it's all the same to you,
I'd be just as...

1136
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,412
Done.

1137
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:50,747
Release the swine.

1138
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:59,798
Perhaps, if you don't mind,
I could tag along with you folk for a...

1139
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:04,803
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

1140
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:14,354
I could have swore it was
somewhere right around here.

1141
01:44:44,487 --> 01:44:46,821
We must not stop.

1142
01:45:04,173 --> 01:45:05,548
Dead end.

1143
01:45:06,592 --> 01:45:08,510
Dead. End.

1144
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:10,595
Dead end.

1145
01:45:11,681 --> 01:45:14,599
Jack, I'm starting to think
you don't know where you're going.

1146
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:18,228
It is not the destination
so much as the journey, they say.

1147
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,897
Chalices, if you please.

1148
01:45:32,952 --> 01:45:34,452
Stand back.

1149
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:58,393
Jack...

1150
01:45:58,561 --> 01:46:00,395
...have you ever, in fact...

1151
01:46:00,563 --> 01:46:06,109
...seen with your own eyes...
the Fountain of Youth?

1152
01:46:06,277 --> 01:46:08,445
I'm sorry, could you
repeat the question, please?

1153
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:10,071
Quartermaster.

1154
01:46:11,032 --> 01:46:11,948
No, no!

1155
01:46:15,661 --> 01:46:17,787
Wait, wait! Wait.

1156
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:25,503
"Aqua... de Vida."

1157
01:47:04,877 --> 01:47:07,378
Master Scrum...

1158
01:47:07,546 --> 01:47:10,381
...do you mind?
- Squire?

1159
01:48:09,108 --> 01:48:11,067
So beautiful.

1160
01:48:50,608 --> 01:48:53,193
Sparrow, I'll be the first
to taste those waters.

1161
01:48:57,698 --> 01:48:59,282
Father.

1162
01:49:02,578 --> 01:49:04,829
The one-legged man.

1163
01:49:07,416 --> 01:49:11,336
- You brought him here.
- Would I do that?

1164
01:49:11,503 --> 01:49:13,588
Edward Teach!

1165
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:17,008
For crimes committed on the high seas,

1166
01:49:17,176 --> 01:49:21,012
by the authority granted me
by His Majesty the King...

1167
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:24,349
...and with a goodly amount
of personal satisfaction...

1168
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:27,560
...I hereby place you
in the custody of the court,

1169
01:49:27,728 --> 01:49:31,022
and declare you to be my prisoner.

1170
01:49:32,107 --> 01:49:35,610
My trick's out, is that it?

1171
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:40,156
Such crimes do include, but are not
limited to, piracy, treason,

1172
01:49:40,324 --> 01:49:44,452
murder, torture of
the most heinous sort,

1173
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:48,498
including the brutal theft of one used,
twisted, hairy right leg.

1174
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:54,003
You... dare face this sword?

1175
01:49:54,171 --> 01:49:56,589
This far away from your ship? Aye.

1176
01:49:56,757 --> 01:50:01,469
Aye. That be the cold breath
of fate I feel down my nape.

1177
01:50:01,637 --> 01:50:07,267
But I'll have one last fight, by God.

1178
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,143
Kill 'em all!

1179
01:50:10,813 --> 01:50:12,563
Hang on a minute.

1180
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:16,609
I just... I just need
to understand something.

1181
01:50:16,777 --> 01:50:20,113
Right, so, you will fight against them,

1182
01:50:20,281 --> 01:50:21,572
they will fight against you.

1183
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:25,410
All on account of him
wanting to kill him?

1184
01:50:25,577 --> 01:50:29,497
Where is the sense? Exactly.

1185
01:50:29,665 --> 01:50:33,376
I say, let them fight
each other while we lay back,

1186
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:36,963
watch, have a drink,
place some wagers!

1187
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:39,382
Aye.

1188
01:50:41,969 --> 01:50:43,553
- Kill 'em!
- No quarter!

1189
01:51:14,084 --> 01:51:15,710
Get off me!

1190
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:49,702
Scrum, the chalices!

1191
01:51:51,872 --> 01:51:52,955
And the tear! Follow!

1192
01:51:57,002 --> 01:51:58,169
Fight!

1193
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:02,632
Hand it over. The tear.
There's a good lad.

1194
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,093
I'm more afraid of her
than I am of you.

1195
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:13,017
Hand it over.
There's a good lad.

1196
01:52:16,438 --> 01:52:20,149
- The chalices, if you please.
- Sorry, Jack.

1197
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:24,529
I told you, I need years.
And now, yours will do.

1198
01:52:32,496 --> 01:52:33,663
Scrum!

1199
01:52:55,352 --> 01:52:56,811
Syrena...

1200
01:53:00,524 --> 01:53:03,317
Oh God, you will not take her.

1201
01:53:03,485 --> 01:53:08,406
If you have taken her,
you will give her back.

1202
01:53:08,574 --> 01:53:10,908
Give her back...

1203
01:53:11,076 --> 01:53:13,911
Give her back, please. Please.

1204
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:40,271
I expected fate
to put up more of a fight, eh?

1205
01:53:57,164 --> 01:54:00,875
I will not have that smile
on your face as I strike you down.

1206
01:54:02,377 --> 01:54:05,421
Take a gander, Edward Teach.

1207
01:54:35,994 --> 01:54:39,288
This land is hereby forever
claimed in the glorious name

1208
01:54:39,456 --> 01:54:41,999
of His Majesty King George...

1209
01:54:48,298 --> 01:54:51,175
Someone make a note
of that man's bravery.

1210
01:54:58,183 --> 01:55:01,894
Señorita, the chalices, porfavor.

1211
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:24,250
Only God can grant eternal life,
not this pagan water.

1212
01:55:35,345 --> 01:55:38,806
Men, destroy this profane temple!

1213
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:42,852
The Fountain!

1214
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:58,451
You are a fool.

1215
01:55:58,619 --> 01:56:01,871
You seek in this place
what only faith can provide.

1216
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:04,540
Faith? In faith,
there is light enough to see

1217
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:06,917
but darkness enough to blind.

1218
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:12,798
What devilry is this?

1219
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:19,388
- For the Pearl.
- What have you done?

1220
01:56:22,934 --> 01:56:25,311
Angelica! Don't! It's poison!

1221
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:32,276
I'm not such the fool
to take on Blackbeard

1222
01:56:32,444 --> 01:56:35,821
without a little venomous advantage.

1223
01:56:37,157 --> 01:56:38,616
Jack!

1224
01:56:50,462 --> 01:56:52,505
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,

1225
01:56:52,673 --> 01:56:56,092
and this sword,
payment for my missing limb!

1226
01:57:10,524 --> 01:57:11,899
Hang on! Pull!

1227
01:57:57,195 --> 01:57:59,530
Do not waste my tear.

1228
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:31,145
Drink this.
This one has the tear.

1229
01:58:31,313 --> 01:58:33,272
- You must drink the other.
- No!

1230
01:58:34,065 --> 01:58:37,276
I cannot save you both.
One of you must sacrifice.

1231
01:58:38,236 --> 01:58:41,322
You take it, Father, for your soul.

1232
01:58:43,366 --> 01:58:48,788
Captain Teach, she's dying.
You must save your daughter.

1233
01:58:49,998 --> 01:58:52,750
This one takes life?

1234
01:58:52,918 --> 01:58:54,752
This one has the tear and gives life?

1235
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:56,170
Aye, hurry!

1236
01:59:05,096 --> 01:59:09,350
Angelica...
Save me, my child.

1237
01:59:11,269 --> 01:59:12,686
No.

1238
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:22,822
I love you, Father.

1239
01:59:35,836 --> 01:59:37,419
Wait a minute.

1240
01:59:39,631 --> 01:59:42,424
In fact, it might have been
the other way around.

1241
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:47,096
This cup had the tear,
that one had the other bit.

1242
01:59:47,264 --> 01:59:48,472
Trickster!

1243
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,474
- Devil!
- Father!

1244
01:59:57,524 --> 01:59:59,024
You bastard! How could you?

1245
02:00:00,068 --> 02:00:01,485
Your father saved you.

1246
02:00:01,653 --> 02:00:04,154
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

1247
02:01:05,008 --> 02:01:07,092
You are hurt.

1248
02:01:09,346 --> 02:01:11,221
In body only.

1249
02:01:12,933 --> 02:01:17,144
My mind is at peace...
because of you.

1250
02:01:18,229 --> 02:01:21,065
- Me?
- Yes.

1251
02:01:22,108 --> 02:01:24,485
I was lost.

1252
02:01:25,487 --> 02:01:30,115
The wind, the tides...

1253
02:01:30,283 --> 02:01:33,327
...they ought to renew a man's faith.

1254
02:01:34,913 --> 02:01:36,830
But for me, only you.

1255
02:01:37,749 --> 02:01:41,460
Philip, I can save you.

1256
02:01:41,628 --> 02:01:44,546
You need only ask.

1257
02:01:46,049 --> 02:01:50,803
- I seek but one thing.
- What is that?

1258
02:01:51,846 --> 02:01:54,181
Forgiveness.

1259
02:01:54,349 --> 02:01:57,643
If not for me, you would
never have been captured.

1260
02:01:57,811 --> 02:01:59,436
Ask.

1261
02:02:01,356 --> 02:02:03,148
Forgive me?

1262
02:02:28,299 --> 02:02:29,508
I hate you.

1263
02:02:29,676 --> 02:02:31,969
The bloke who saved your life?

1264
02:02:32,137 --> 02:02:35,305
The years I possess,
stolen from my own father!

1265
02:02:35,473 --> 02:02:38,475
I only helped Blackbeard do what
any father should have done.

1266
02:02:38,643 --> 02:02:41,812
You are cruel and ignorant.

1267
02:02:45,567 --> 02:02:49,319
One pistol, one shot.

1268
02:02:49,487 --> 02:02:51,697
To kill myself before I starve?

1269
02:02:51,865 --> 02:02:53,407
There's no trusting you, love.

1270
02:02:53,575 --> 02:02:55,993
Besides, this is a
well-traveled trade route.

1271
02:02:56,161 --> 02:02:57,745
You can signal a passing ship.

1272
02:02:57,912 --> 02:03:01,331
Or you can just bite the
proverbial bullet, as it were.

1273
02:03:01,499 --> 02:03:03,083
And how will I get free
of these bonds?

1274
02:03:03,251 --> 02:03:05,961
You broke free of your bonds
half an hour ago,

1275
02:03:06,129 --> 02:03:08,922
waiting for the precise moment
to pounce.

1276
02:03:11,634 --> 02:03:13,302
Admit it, Jack.

1277
02:03:13,470 --> 02:03:17,347
- You still love me.
- If you had a sister and a dog,

1278
02:03:17,515 --> 02:03:19,808
I'd choose the dog.

1279
02:03:19,976 --> 02:03:23,312
Treasure!
There is a chest with jewels!

1280
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:25,689
Jewels with the power
to rule the wind and tide!

1281
02:03:25,857 --> 02:03:28,942
- You're making that up!
- Wait...

1282
02:03:29,778 --> 02:03:33,447
I am with child. Yours.

1283
02:03:34,699 --> 02:03:36,075
I don't recall that we ever had...

1284
02:03:36,242 --> 02:03:38,952
- You were drunk!
- I've actually never been that drunk.

1285
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,204
Wait!

1286
02:03:42,123 --> 02:03:44,166
There is something I want to say to you.

1287
02:03:44,334 --> 02:03:48,504
Something I wanted to say
from the moment we first met.

1288
02:03:49,464 --> 02:03:50,547
Go on, then.

1289
02:03:52,926 --> 02:03:54,218
I love you.

1290
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,640
As do I.

1291
02:03:59,808 --> 02:04:03,227
Always have. Always will.

1292
02:04:07,774 --> 02:04:09,233
I gotta go.

1293
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:10,400
Jack!

1294
02:04:12,737 --> 02:04:14,321
This is not over!

1295
02:04:15,406 --> 02:04:16,448
Jack!

1296
02:04:26,042 --> 02:04:27,543
Missed!

1297
02:04:42,851 --> 02:04:45,853
The Revenge is mine.

1298
02:04:52,569 --> 02:04:53,986
Sir...

1299
02:04:56,489 --> 02:04:58,323
We found this below decks.

1300
02:05:24,434 --> 02:05:26,685
All hands!
Ply to windward!

1301
02:05:26,853 --> 02:05:30,397
Get cracking,
ye blooming cockroaches!

1302
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:35,694
The Crown served me well.

1303
02:05:35,862 --> 02:05:38,822
But now, by the gods of sea and sky...

1304
02:05:38,990 --> 02:05:43,076
...make way for Tortuga!

1305
02:05:54,214 --> 02:05:57,341
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback,
you made it!

1306
02:05:57,508 --> 02:05:59,051
Aye!

1307
02:05:59,219 --> 02:06:00,719
And I trust we managed a profit

1308
02:06:00,887 --> 02:06:05,098
- from ourjoint enterprise?
- Feast your eyes.

1309
02:06:10,188 --> 02:06:12,689
The compass led me straight and true.

1310
02:06:12,857 --> 02:06:14,816
What of Blackbeard's men
guarding the ship?

1311
02:06:14,984 --> 02:06:18,820
I employed the selfsame maneuver
we perfected in New Guinea.

1312
02:06:18,988 --> 02:06:23,033
Seemed a shame to leave
an entire fleet behind.

1313
02:06:23,201 --> 02:06:25,244
Shame indeed.

1314
02:06:37,215 --> 02:06:38,548
I hate that monkey.

1315
02:06:38,716 --> 02:06:42,135
So, the Pearl...
Any idea how to get her out?

1316
02:06:42,303 --> 02:06:45,305
We shall need a crossbow,
an hourglass, three goats.

1317
02:06:45,473 --> 02:06:48,475
One of us must learn to play the trumpet
whilst the other one goes like this...

1318
02:06:49,018 --> 02:06:52,271
- I know a man with a goat.
- Good. I can go like this.

1319
02:06:54,941 --> 02:06:56,566
Jack, I have to ask...

1320
02:06:56,734 --> 02:06:59,569
You had the chalices,
the water, the tear...

1321
02:06:59,737 --> 02:07:02,239
You could have lived maybe forever.

1322
02:07:02,407 --> 02:07:04,366
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.

1323
02:07:04,534 --> 02:07:07,411
But better to not know
which moment may be your last.

1324
02:07:07,578 --> 02:07:09,579
Every morsel of your entire being

1325
02:07:09,747 --> 02:07:12,833
alive to the infinite mystery of it all.

1326
02:07:13,001 --> 02:07:15,502
And who's to say
I won't live forever, eh?

1327
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:18,755
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth.

1328
02:07:18,923 --> 02:07:21,800
I have no say in it, Gibbs.

1329
02:07:21,968 --> 02:07:23,927
It's a pirate's life for me.

1330
02:07:24,887 --> 02:07:26,388
Savvy?
