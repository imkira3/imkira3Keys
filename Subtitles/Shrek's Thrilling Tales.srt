2
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:24,001
Did you enjoy your stay
in the hospital, Heimlich?

3
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:25,539
Not funny.

4
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:27,734
<i>No more spying on the neighbors, ja?</i>

5
00:00:27,877 --> 00:00:29,811
You see what kind of trouble
it gets you into.

6
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,541
<i>Ja, first it's the poor old lady
in the shoe.</i>

7
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:34,241
Well, l thought l saw something.

8
00:00:34,386 --> 00:00:36,980
<i>You called the police
on that poor woman. And for what?</i>

9
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:40,558
<i>She was forcing those children
to make shoes. l saw!</i>

10
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:43,821
They live in a shoe!
They were fixing their roof!

11
00:00:43,964 --> 00:00:45,659
But do you learn? No!

12
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,235
<i>Ja, no! Then you are bothering
the children, Jack und Jill.</i>

13
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:55,838
<i>- They looked suspicious!
- Ja, ja, ja. So you still don't learn.</i>

14
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:58,572
Next, you are climbing up
on the roof to see something.

15
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:03,243
<i>l tell you l see something,
und l think it's a UFO!</i>

16
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,426
<i>Ja, it was only the cow
jumping over the moon.</i>

17
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:12,257
<i>Ja, so why is the dish
running away with the spoon?</i>

18
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:14,525
lt's like talking to the brick house.

19
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:18,896
Ooh, what is going on over there?
When did we get the new neighbor?

20
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,439
<i>- Wait! Wait! l thought l saw something!
- Nein!</i>

21
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,574
No more of this snoopy-spy nonsense.

22
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:33,211
<i>You're going to sit right here
und not bother the neighbors.</i>

23
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:35,416
<i>Now you behave,ja? Ja.</i>

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,461
<i>Nein. l will behave.
This little piggy is all good.</i>

25
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:57,106
Tell me l am not seeing things.
l know what l see.

26
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,055
Very suspicious.

27
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:11,996
lf l have to sit here all night,
l will see something.

28
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:33,927
l have the eye of the eagle.
l miss nothing.

29
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:36,292
What is that?!

30
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,048
Heimlich, are you crazy?

31
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:56,418
There's something
going on in that house!

32
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:58,855
See for yourself
and then call me crazy.

33
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:01,060
Hi.

34
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:04,461
<i>- Ja, you are crazy.
- What? Give me that!</i>

35
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,734
- He is a maniac!
- Halt! Enough!

36
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:11,602
<i>We are going over there
und we will prove, once and for all,</i>

37
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:15,543
to this little piggy
there's nothing going on!

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,877
<i>Ja, und when we return
we will make with the ''l told you so.''</i>

39
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:40,769
Horst! Horst, look out!

40
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:42,776
<i>Look behind you! Oh, Gott!</i>

41
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:57,386
Oh, my stars, another little piggy!

42
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:59,396
What do you want from me?

43
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:02,728
l want you for dinner.

44
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,735
Buckle up, buttercup.

45
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:18,284
Why is it always
the screaming with you?

46
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:20,151
Oh, are you going to eat this?

47
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,185
- What's going on here?
- Dinner.

48
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,355
<i>Oh,ja. The fräulein makes
the best everything.</i>

49
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,329
But what about...

50
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:36,400
You guys didn't see me
doing anything weird, did you?

51
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:39,340
You were acting like
the cuckoo without the clock.

52
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:41,210
You buried a box of knives
in the ground.

53
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,545
You turned into this big fat lady
and cooked us food.

54
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:47,179
Yeah, that one.
You guys better get out of here.

55
00:04:47,325 --> 00:04:49,350
<i>- But everything is so delicious.
- Ja.</i>

56
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:51,222
<i>- Ja.
- No, trust me.</i>

57
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:52,852
You guys don't wanna be here for...

58
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:57,863
...my main course,
stuffed piggies in a blanket!

59
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:09,249
- l told you l saw something!
- Come back!

60
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:10,715
l'm really sorry that...

61
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,376
...you can't stay for dinner!

62
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,012
- Wait for me, you swine!
- Move faster, Heimi!

63
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:16,556
This is just awkward.

64
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:17,591
Come back!

65
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:18,592
Keep running.

66
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:20,697
Come back!

67
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:22,459
Just keep running.

68
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:03,104
Greetings, fellow Halloweeners.

69
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,942
l just said ''weeners.''

70
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:09,571
B.O.B.!

71
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:14,185
l just said ''weeners.''

72
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:18,252
Tonight's story is a tale so scary,

73
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:21,829
so horrifying, so shocking,

74
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:25,934
so, so...
so full of vegetables...

75
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:28,867
- B.O.B., stick to the script!
- Oh, right.

76
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,771
lt all started with a spooky spaceship,

77
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:35,277
mutant pumpkins
and monsters saving the day!

78
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:38,713
But that was only the beginning.

79
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:41,650
So sit back and get ready for a story

80
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:44,791
that is guaranteed
to give you nightmares.

81
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:51,361
OK, wrap it up.

82
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:02,168
Come on, kids!
Time for the costume contest.

83
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:05,579
The winner gets their weight in candy!

84
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:10,917
Avast ye, scallywags.
That booty shall be mine!

85
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,570
Now it's booty time!

86
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,197
Hey!

87
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:32,280
Me timbers being shivered.

88
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,924
Come on, B.O.B.,
that candy was for the contest.

89
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,759
But it all tastes so good.

90
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:49,226
But it all tastes so...

91
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:55,403
Hello?

92
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:58,445
Hello...

93
00:07:58,615 --> 00:07:59,741
Who's there?

94
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:03,546
l've got a Nutter Buddy Butter Bar,
and l'm not afraid to use it!

95
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:06,148
Carrot!

96
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:12,429
Whoa, kid, that is one scary costume.

97
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,397
For a minute there,
l thought you were a real carrot.

98
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:20,734
And carrots really creep me out.

99
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:24,935
Like that! That was creepy.

100
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:28,982
You are a shoo-in
to win that costume contest.

101
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:33,412
Kids today and their papier-mâché.

102
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,291
Hello.

103
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:44,632
- Mr. Murphy?
- That carrot made Carl a zombie!

104
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:47,766
Creepy carrot! Danger! Danger!

105
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:50,604
- lt's alive! lt's a living carrot.
- l know, right?

106
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:52,939
- l totally freaked out the same way.
- Giddyap!

107
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,710
Kid, you are killing with that costume.

108
00:08:56,886 --> 00:09:00,287
- l'm getting out of here!
- Doc, how could you do this?

109
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:02,381
Worst party ever!

110
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,790
- He was... He was just a...
- Mutant zombie carrot.

111
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:09,694
lt must've been contaminated
by one of the alien pumpkins.

112
00:09:09,868 --> 00:09:11,130
No!

113
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:16,070
And apparently the curse can be broken
by eliminating the infected carrot.

114
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:21,510
And that one carrot could've infected
our brains and transformed us all

115
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:24,845
into slack-jawed walking vegetables.

116
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,486
- Doc?
- Whoa!

117
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:30,749
- Kind of like that.
- Everyone, run!

118
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:34,586
Oh, man. l don't wanna be a zombie.
What are we gonna do?

119
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,599
Well, we definitely know that we
shouldn't blast them with this scanner.

120
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:44,104
l definitely just blasted you
with this scanner! l love this thing!

121
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:46,210
Back! Stay back.

122
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:48,411
- B.O.B.!
- Thank me later!

123
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:50,606
- No!
- Bang, bang, bang!

124
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:53,583
Doc! We're completely surrounded!

125
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:55,346
No, we're not.

126
00:09:56,624 --> 00:09:58,558
Now we're completely surrounded.

127
00:10:00,696 --> 00:10:02,186
lt's Monger!

128
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:06,067
Lock and load, cowboys.
The cavalry has arrived.

129
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:09,796
Nobody told me they can leap.

130
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:16,137
Quickly, now.
Create a barricade.

131
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,148
There's a jet-packing zombie general
with an army of carrots out there...

132
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,379
The more that l shoot them, there's more
of them, and l don't like carrots...

133
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,150
B.O.B., calm down! Talk slowly.

134
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:32,323
Zombie general, army of carrots...

135
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:34,561
B.O.B., just get the back door!

136
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:36,735
l'm on it.

137
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:40,106
- Where do you want it?
- Oh, dear.

138
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,977
Give me that.

139
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:53,421
Well, well.
lf it ain't the gruesome twosome.

140
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:56,756
Now go on. Get out and stay out!

141
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,663
Hey, Link.

142
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:06,498
B.O.B., time to go!

143
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:12,037
l forgot the pickle.

144
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:23,317
Cotton candy, bubblegum!
Go, team, go, and beat those bums!

145
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:24,554
Yeah!

146
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,193
All right!

147
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:31,497
B.O.B., focus. Zombie problem.

148
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:41,548
Oh, no! B.O.B.
l can already see it.

149
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:47,247
The vacant, lifeless expression.
They've already infected your brain.

150
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:51,862
But hear this, zombies,
you may take my brain,

151
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,090
but you will never take my dignity!

152
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:06,444
Come on, pull yourself together.

153
00:12:06,615 --> 00:12:09,778
l know this is scary,
but we're gonna get through this.

154
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:15,023
And when we do, here is my number.

155
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,023
Call me.

156
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:22,191
Of course! B.O.B.,
how can a zombie infect your brain

157
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,767
when you don't even have one to infect?

158
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:29,196
- What?
- B.O.B., you're immune!

159
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:30,536
Zombie carrot!

160
00:12:32,246 --> 00:12:34,373
Hold still, Doc! l'll get it.

161
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:39,748
And if you're immune,
you can save us all.

162
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:46,050
There's only one way to stop
the zombies and save your friends.

163
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:48,993
You must eat all... carrots!

164
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,262
- What was that last part?
- You must eat all the carrots!

165
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:56,066
No!

166
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,133
Don't cry, little monster.

167
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,906
Uncle Monger's got enough carrot puree
to feed you your entire life.

168
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:07,349
Jerry, bring over the feed hose, ASAP.
The boy's hungry!

169
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:23,496
Eat the carrots, save your friends.
Eat the carrots, save your friends.

170
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,710
You know what?
lt's easier if l just make new friends.

171
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,041
Here are four new friends already.

172
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:36,121
Quick, to the rooftop, where we'll get
a great view of our new future together.

173
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:03,210
Eat the carrots, save your friends.

174
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:12,229
Excuse me, son. That's my girl.

175
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:15,162
Not this time, amigo.

176
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:19,265
l can't do it!

177
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,932
Oh, yes l can.

178
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,169
You guys are going down.

179
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,945
Right down into my belly.

180
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,382
'Cause l'm gonna eat you.

181
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:59,445
l did it. l ate all my vegetables!

182
00:14:59,623 --> 00:15:03,059
And now it's time for dessert.

183
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,332
What?! But l ate all the carrots.
The curse should be broken.

184
00:15:15,743 --> 00:15:18,940
l don't understand.
Why are you guys still zombies?

185
00:15:19,113 --> 00:15:21,673
l ate every single carrot.

186
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:26,680
- You!
- You...

187
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,433
Come on, guys.
l only missed one carrot.

188
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:52,386
Hey, that's my Nutter Buddy Butter Bar.

189
00:15:56,726 --> 00:15:58,318
You wouldn't dare.

190
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,794
You just crossed the line.

191
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,604
Wow, chocolate-covered carrot.

192
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,741
Still disgusting.

193
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:21,011
Whoa!

194
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:26,259
Well done, B.O.B., you broke the curse!

195
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:29,761
- You guys! lt worked!
- l knew you could do it!

196
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:32,060
Not so hard, really full.

197
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,334
And so, there you have it.

198
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,035
l saved the day
because those silly little carrots

199
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:43,077
had absolutely no effect on me.

200
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:46,208
Unlike you. Right, Bubbles?

201
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:48,218
So, remember, kids:

202
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:52,119
Eat your veggies
or they just might eat you.

203
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:33,158
- That's a dead end.
- Come on, Shrek.

204
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:35,462
Who needs a map
when you've got animal instinct?

205
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:42,676
- Darn bugs. Stupid map.
- Hey, what the...

206
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,940
- Come on!
- Shrek, a little help here!

207
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,516
All right. Will you...

208
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:50,018
l say we take the 10 to the 305
and get off at Fairy Tale Falls.

209
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:53,283
- What are you talking about?
- Or we could fly there.

210
00:17:53,426 --> 00:17:55,826
ls there an off button on you?

211
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,460
What's wrong, Princess?

212
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,934
You shouldn't be this unhappy
until years into the marriage.

213
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:06,939
lt's the happiest day of my life.

214
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:09,475
Let me guess.
You're overwhelmed by love?

215
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:13,048
No! l mean, yes.
But that's not why...

216
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:14,650
The shrimp platter was bad?

217
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:17,583
- No, Donkey! l'm just...
- Wait! Wait! l got it! l got it!

218
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,282
You always wanted a puppy,
but all you got was toasters!

219
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:22,985
No, l'm sitting in an onion!

220
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:26,530
This carriage is one big onion.

221
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:30,123
Why didn't you say so?
l'll turn on the air.

222
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:35,401
- Much better.
- Noble steed at your service.

223
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:39,707
Would you look at that?
Donkey! l found a shortcut.

224
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:44,652
- Are you crazy?
- Jumping Jiminy, that's a big one.

225
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:46,846
What? Hey, man, l hate spiders!

226
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:51,956
Stop that, would you?
Where'd he go?

227
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,597
You are too easy to scare. Come on.

228
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,001
That forest could be hexed
or voodooed or anything!

229
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,868
l ain't going in there.

230
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:05,740
Listen, l'm an ogre.
l'm the one that does the scaring.

231
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,848
What is there to be scared of?

232
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,444
- That!
- Thelonius!

233
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:16,657
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Sorry, Princess, honeymoon's over.

234
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,763
- Let go!
- Shrek!

235
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:29,373
- Fiona!
- Shrek!

236
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:32,307
- Fiona!
- Let me go!

237
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:35,710
- To the carriage!
- Shrek!

238
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,613
We got a donkey driving a carriage
made from an onion.

239
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:40,583
lt's dark and our horses
are wearing sunglasses.

240
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,623
Cut to the chase, Donkey!
Just cut to the chase.

241
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:45,556
Hit it, boys!

242
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:51,492
- Fiona!
- Shrek!

243
00:19:57,642 --> 00:19:59,109
Help!

244
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:02,880
All done. Oh, no. No!

245
00:20:04,017 --> 00:20:05,348
No!

246
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:10,688
You're gonna get an elbow to the groin!

247
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:13,453
- That was close.
- Now that's sweet.

248
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:16,792
- Shrek? Shrek!
- Watch out!

249
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:26,670
Licorice?

250
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,177
Hey, Shrek! l hope you're insured!

251
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:33,348
That house cost me a lot of dough!

252
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:38,722
- ls there a doctor in the house?
- Hey, sorry about that, Gingy!

253
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:40,486
That's gross.

254
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,959
Oh, no!

255
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,703
Oh, no!

256
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:59,515
l can see! l can see!

257
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:02,043
Never mind.

258
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,985
Fiona!

259
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:11,122
Shrek, this isn't another one
of those shortcuts, is it?

260
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:13,495
Just get a move on.

261
00:21:13,634 --> 00:21:16,797
- Okay. l'm not afraid.
- Fiona!

262
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:19,839
l can do this. l'm a noble steed.

263
00:21:19,975 --> 00:21:23,911
lt's all right. lt's just a park
with no children and no playground.

264
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:27,209
Shrek! Shrek!

265
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:30,409
l feel dead people.

266
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:37,583
Are you getting the willies?
The trembles?

267
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,564
The shakes? The heebie-jeebies?

268
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:44,067
Stop messing with me, Shrek.
This place is already creeping me out.

269
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:46,867
Don't tell me you're afraid of ghosts.

270
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:48,998
l'm not afraid.

271
00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:52,744
What a crack-up!

272
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:56,984
Shrek? Shrek! Wait up!

273
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:02,191
Talk about rewriting history.

274
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,733
Well, looks like Farquaad's still trying
to compensate for something.

275
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:11,166
l wonder what that could be.

276
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:14,296
l don't know.
This is just plain freaky.

277
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:16,306
l wonder if he's behind all this.

278
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:18,411
That's just crazy talk.

279
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:32,552
Now l'm seeing things.
Can we get out of here? Please?

280
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:34,357
Sure. Of course.

281
00:22:34,498 --> 00:22:36,329
Now, you wouldn't happen to have

282
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:38,026
another carriage in your pocket,
would you?

283
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,161
Donkeys don't have pockets.

284
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:42,466
But some of us do have wings!

285
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,584
- Wrong dragon!
- Wrong whistle.

286
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:57,616
- Farquaad?
- What have you done with my wife?

287
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,821
Your wife? Don't you mean your widow?

288
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,990
l know l seen you die
in the first movie!

289
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:08,070
You fools! This time
it's your turn to be the entrée!

290
00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:11,903
Okay, my sweet,
take care of them! Bon appétit.

291
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:16,077
Will you stop that?

292
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:20,813
Shut it!

293
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:26,055
- You can go first. l'll be the dessert.
- Great.

294
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:28,890
That's my girl!

295
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:35,904
Hey, baby, l was hoping you'd show up!

296
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,338
- Princess at three o'clock.
- Shrek!

297
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:41,308
- Hi, Princess!
- Fiona!

298
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,190
Oh, no. Shrek!

299
00:23:59,968 --> 00:24:01,458
Oops. Sorry.

300
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:06,268
Coming in!

301
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:08,934
- Dive! Dive!
- Got it. Dive! Dive!

302
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:12,071
This is Red Dragon. We're going in.

303
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,256
Evasive action!

304
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,356
Lock and load!

305
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:30,834
Stay on target. Stay on target!
Stay on target! And fire now!

306
00:24:31,974 --> 00:24:34,966
On my mark, retract wings! Now!

307
00:24:37,113 --> 00:24:39,047
Turn and burn!

308
00:24:43,955 --> 00:24:45,718
Smooth move, Ex-Lax.

309
00:24:45,857 --> 00:24:48,826
Like l always say,
behind every successful donkey,

310
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:51,088
there's a fire-breathing dragon.

311
00:25:01,142 --> 00:25:04,077
You might
as well stop struggling, Princess.

312
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,840
Soon you and l will be together forever.

313
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:11,010
With you as my Spirit Queen,
l'll be King of the Underworld!

314
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:12,951
Over my dead body!

315
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,923
Exactly. Over she goes, Thelonius.

316
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:24,869
- Thelonius?
