00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:06,495
Four turtles...

3
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,829
...four brothers...

4
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:16,305
...genetically reborn
in the sewers of New York.

5
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:21,770
Named after the great
Renaissance masters...

6
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:24,711
...and trained as ninjas.

7
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:34,683
They battled many creatures and foes
before defeating their archenemy...

8
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,194
...the Shredder.

9
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:46,096
But now a greater evil is poised
to destroy their very brotherhood.

10
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:51,334
An evil born 3000 years ago.

11
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:02,617
It was in that time
that a warrior king named Yoatl...

12
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:07,816
...led a brotherhood that fought
side by side with one purpose:

13
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:13,624
To conquer all the kingdoms
of the world.

14
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,502
Nothing could stand in their way...

15
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,239
...as they left a trail of destruction
behind them.

16
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,829
In his quest,
the warrior learned of a constellation...

17
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,522
...known as the Stars of Kikan.

18
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,567
Every 3000 years,
the stars would align...

19
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:56,470
...opening a portal
to a world of unknown power.

20
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,606
He became immortal...

21
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:05,011
...but at a price.

22
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:12,546
His brotherhood was turned to stone.

23
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:15,285
And upon the portal's opening...

24
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:21,296
...13 monsters were released
into our world.

25
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,220
The warrior king was left
to eternally walk the Earth...

26
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:59,633
...unable to die
or forget his horrible mistake.

27
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:10,637
And the monsters
that were unleashed...

28
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:16,345
...continue to plague mankind
to this very day.

29
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,714
Monsters.

30
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:45,307
No.

31
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:48,409
We appreciate the generous donation...

32
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:52,523
...for the continued protection
of your village.

33
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:59,056
After all, the jungle
can be a very dangerous place.

34
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:03,132
- Mama!
- Oh, she is dangerous.

35
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,496
There's monsters out there.

36
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:29,684
Watch where you're going.

37
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,921
There's a log on the road, señor.

38
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:36,659
Well, if you're not too busy, remove it.

39
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:56,145
Who are you? Show yourself.

40
00:05:56,321 --> 00:06:00,519
The ghost of the jungle.
He punishes those who prey upon the weak.

41
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,023
He's coming.

42
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:07,626
I just remembered I left the stove on.
My wife hates that.

43
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:11,394
- Coward. Get back here.
- You're on your own, jefe.

44
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,666
Show yourself.
Do you realize who you're dealing with?

45
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,378
What is this-? What?

46
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:38,322
I am not afraid of a myth.

47
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,556
I'm not afraid of a ghost.

48
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:49,040
What are you?

49
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:08,588
It's a miracle.

50
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:21,066
The ghost of the jungle.

51
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,470
There. That's where I saw him.

52
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,771
Thank you.

53
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:33,050
You'd better get home now.

54
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:35,482
Do you know the ghost?

55
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:38,322
He wasn't always a ghost.

56
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:03,608
Hello?

57
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:11,353
Is anyone here?

58
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:15,149
Hello?

59
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,993
It's a long way from the city
to just drop in.

60
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:29,533
Leo.

61
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,978
You came all the way down here
to look for me?

62
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:37,137
Actually, I was already here
on business.

63
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:39,806
But then the local legend
started sounding familiar...

64
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,475
...so I decided to snoop around.

65
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:44,645
- What kind of business?
- Ancient artifacts.

66
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:47,121
Some tycoon with too much time
on his hands...

67
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:50,625
...has his heart set on a collection
of 3000-year-old statues.

68
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:53,855
Well, you always did run
with a strange crowd, April.

69
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:58,594
Yeah, well. Our strange crowd
hasn't been the same without you.

70
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:02,735
Things aren't looking so good
back home.

71
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:05,238
How bad could it be?

72
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,072
Donnie's probably got everything
under control.

73
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:09,577
Sir? Sir. Sir.

74
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:14,210
Did you turn the computer on?
Have you plugged it in?

75
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,580
Yeah, that would help.

76
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:17,346
No, I'm not playing hard to get.

77
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:20,184
I'm telling you, sir,
it's not that kind of phone line.

78
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:23,919
I'm not your enemy. I'm just Donnie,
your friendly IT tech support...

79
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:26,063
...here to help you 24 hours a day, sir.

80
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:28,964
Yeah, I'm sorry. Ma'am.

81
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:34,294
But Donnie's a genius.
Why would he take a job like that?

82
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:35,837
At least he's keeping busy.

83
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:39,067
Well, if he's doing that,
who's keeping an eye on Mikey?

84
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:44,147
Mike's gotten into
the entertainment business.

85
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:46,606
Yeah.

86
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:50,983
Happy birthday from Cowabunga Carl.

87
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:56,191
Take it easy, little dudes.
I bruise easily.

88
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:59,694
Hey, black-and-blue clashes with green,
dudes. Hey, that's-

89
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:01,263
He's a big hit.

90
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:04,766
All right. Let's hear it.
What's Raph doing?

91
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:08,963
No one really knows.
He just sleeps all day.

92
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,131
Well, what's he do all night?

93
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:28,752
2802, 2802, burglary in progress
at 55th and Broadway.

94
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:31,327
Suspects considered
armed and dangerous.

95
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,891
Time to punch in.

96
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:55,209
Good work, boys. That was easier
than I thought it was gonna be.

97
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:58,220
Hey, look, guys. I grabbed a toaster.

98
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,759
I love your work ethic, Tommy.
It's an inspiration to us all.

99
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:12,893
What was that?

100
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:15,334
What's going on, guys?

101
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:17,941
What in the-?

102
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,817
Looks like it's just you and me, shaky.

103
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:32,614
Take it easy. I'm not gonna hurt you...

104
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,319
...much.

105
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,904
I love when they play hard to get.

106
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:59,576
The Nightwatcher.

107
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:02,119
- He's doing our job for us again.
- Tommy.

108
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:04,949
- Keep your hands to yourself.
- Hey, who's tickling me?

109
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:09,049
Your training period ended a year ago.

110
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:11,695
And Splinter says
you don't write anymore.

111
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:14,525
Splinter sent me down here
to become a better leader.

112
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,031
I can't go back a failure.

113
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:21,104
Besides, these people need me
more than my brothers do.

114
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,067
If Master Splinter were here...

115
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:25,937
...he would ask you,
"What is your heart telling you?"

116
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,444
I don't know.
I just know something's missing.

117
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:34,284
Your brothers need you, Leo.

118
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:37,116
They're lost without you.

119
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:41,557
Leo?

120
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:26,833
Why skate a halfpipe
when you can skate a sewer pipe?

121
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:39,444
Sewer's up, bra.

122
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:45,147
Hey.

123
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,428
Cowabunga.

124
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:07,543
Dude. Going down.

125
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,877
Yeah.

126
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:23,423
Here's Mikey.

127
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:26,186
Guys?

128
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:28,025
Anyone?

129
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:30,464
Hello?

130
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:32,692
Whatever.

131
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:35,733
This place used to be fun.

132
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:40,809
And with rocketing interest rates,
that's bad news for homeowners...

133
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:44,847
...as the real-estate market
continues its downward spiral.

134
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:48,314
Coming up, the vigilante known
as Nightwatcher strikes again.

135
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:52,714
Now, I can 't say for sure,
but he was definitely an alien.

136
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,257
I think it's a disgrace, taking the law
into your own hands like that.

137
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:59,157
- Leave it to the police.
- Up next...

138
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,198
I remember how that used to feel,
busting up crime syndicates.

139
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:07,668
Sure, they had a bunch of guns,
but they weren't like these guns.

140
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,275
Why do you do this to yourself, Mikey?
Those glory days are over.

141
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:15,276
Forget about them. Get on with your life.
Concentrate on your work.

142
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:18,472
Yeah, yeah. Spoken like a true has-been.

143
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,245
Well, look who woke up.

144
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:24,616
I suppose you think the Nightwatcher
is some kind of hero.

145
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:28,584
Beats sitting around doing nothing
while dirtbags run free.

146
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,695
I would love to know what it is
that you do that's so great.

147
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:34,525
We're contributing around here.
All you do is sleep.

148
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:38,897
Yeah, I do nothing. You're right.
You got me all figured out.

149
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,562
I know that your attitude has been
a source of contention to this team.

150
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,402
You think fear is the best way
to accomplish things.

151
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:48,875
First of all, this team you speak of
doesn't exist anymore.

152
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:50,674
And second of all...

153
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:52,281
Raphael.

154
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:57,120
Enough.

155
00:15:57,922 --> 00:15:59,253
I think I made my point.

156
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:01,551
That doesn't prove anything.

157
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:06,962
Why couldn't you send him away
for training?

158
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:11,033
Donatello, this home
has become like an empty shell.

159
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:14,797
Each of your brothers
has strengths and weaknesses.

160
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:18,100
You must learn to be strong
when they are weak.

161
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:20,938
If you don't learn to recognize this...

162
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:25,208
...then all hope is lost for our family.

163
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:43,297
Keep it coming.

164
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:51,974
Hey, careful.

165
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:53,770
Those aren't souvenirs.

166
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:56,769
Sorry about that, ma'am.

167
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:01,780
Where are you, Casey?

168
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:06,221
Come on. Come on, pick up.

169
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:09,019
Don't do this to me again. Not now.

170
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:13,459
Casey can't come to the phone right now
because we're hardly working.

171
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:17,457
This better be good.

172
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:23,073
Casey, I am standing on the dock with
a priceless statue and no delivery truck.

173
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:26,972
- So my question is, where are you?
- April.

174
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:30,512
Hey, babe. I am so sorry.
I set the alarm clock, but...

175
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:36,286
It' s broken. The clock...

176
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:41,248
It' s bad enough that you ' re
out every night playing vigilante...

177
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:44,758
...but we've got a deadline to meet.
- I'm sorry.

178
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:48,365
Oh, wait, babe, real quick.
You left a message saying you found Leo.

179
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:51,525
- I mean, is he there with you?
- No.

180
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:54,728
I found him. He's not coming back.

181
00:17:55,973 --> 00:17:59,739
But didn't you tell him how weird things
have gotten with the Turtles?

182
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:02,744
Look, Casey, we're gonna lose
the biggest client we have...

183
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:04,711
...if you don 't get down here.

184
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:07,851
All right. I'm on my way.

185
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:17,522
Please tell me we're getting paid
by the pound here.

186
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:19,960
Is this place a museum or what?

187
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:23,157
- You've never heard of Winterscorp?
- That's what I'm telling you.

188
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:27,498
They're into everything: Real estate,
technology, pharmaceuticals, hair gel.

189
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:29,697
- I don't wear hair gel.
- Really?

190
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:33,207
I'm the caveman type, au naturel.

191
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:35,811
Just make sure you don't
touch anything in here.

192
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,710
Hey, I was born careful.

193
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:42,249
Hope that wasn't expensive.

194
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:46,223
Oh, wait- Just- I'm-

195
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,882
- Oh, boy.
- Please tell me that wasn't you.

196
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:03,697
- Mr. Winters.
- Miss O'Neil.

197
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:06,435
All the pieces are coming together.

198
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:09,842
Oh, my. This is my associate, Casey.

199
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:12,346
- Nice to meet you, Kenny.
- Boyfriend. It's Casey.

200
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:15,178
- So you were successful?
- Yes. The fourth general.

201
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:17,082
I want to ask you before I go...

202
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:20,713
...if I could take one last look?

203
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:34,303
I believe this is the one
they call General Akeela?

204
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:38,340
It's actually "Aguila,"
but that was a good try.

205
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:43,205
These statues may appear
to be only stone...

206
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:47,374
...but they're like family to me.
I didn't choose them.

207
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:51,282
Friends you can choose,
but never your family.

208
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:53,354
Okay, then.

209
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:57,654
Take care, Mr. Winters.

210
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:07,461
If you've come to kill me,
could you make it fast?

211
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:11,506
I've got a shareholders' meeting at 10.
I'd rather miss it.

212
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:18,848
If we had come here to hurt you,
you'd be hurting already.

213
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:22,247
The Foot Clan and I
have come to hear your offer.

214
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,288
Well, it appears that today
is my lucky day.

215
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:29,382
I must warn you,
we do not come cheap.

216
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,085
Does it look like
money is of any concern to me?

217
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:35,232
Only time is of the essence, my dear.

218
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,664
Since you're so rich and powerful...

219
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:40,770
...what is it we could possibly have
to offer you?

220
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:42,963
I need you to be my eyes and ears.

221
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,370
I have some friends coming to town...

222
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:48,671
...that I'd like to roll out
the red carpet for.

223
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:53,782
Greet them warmly
and bring them to me.

224
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:57,315
And how will we know these friends?

225
00:20:57,488 --> 00:21:01,686
Don't worry, they're impossible to miss.

226
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:30,550
And you keep them up. Got that?

227
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:33,483
And don't let me catch you
calling the cops.

228
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:35,284
What? Not again.

229
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:42,961
Didn't I take care of you last week?

230
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:46,865
Hey. Oh, no. Come on, now. Wait.

231
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,166
I'm very disappointed in you,
knucklehead.

232
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:52,605
Guess night school's in session.

233
00:21:52,777 --> 00:21:54,836
Hope I'm not disturbing class.

234
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:57,606
Hey, Nightwatcher,
need any teaching assistants?

235
00:21:57,782 --> 00:21:59,750
Oh, no. Casey.

236
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:03,785
I got this one covered, pal.
Thanks, but no, thanks.

237
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:09,051
You think you own these rooftops?
I happen to think you could use my help.

238
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,093
And I could use a sidekick.

239
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:14,390
You may have everyone else fooled,
but you haven't fooled me, Raph.

240
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:17,227
Yeah, well, guess what, pal.
Now you-

241
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:20,700
Hey, wait a minute.
How did you know it was me?

242
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:25,031
Wasn't that hard, man.
You know, you look like a big, metal turtle.

243
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,335
It's that obvious, huh?

244
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:33,941
- I should've stayed in law school.
- Ain't that cute? He's trying to get away.

245
00:22:38,055 --> 00:22:39,852
Well, looks like I got a sidekick.

246
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:43,323
Yeah, right. You're the sidekick.

247
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:51,096
- What, is it performance art? I don't get it.
- What was I supposed to do...

248
00:22:51,268 --> 00:22:54,032
...sit around, wait for Leo to come back
and save the day?

249
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:56,298
I mean, we haven't
heard word one from him...

250
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:59,307
...since Splinter sent him away
on his little vacation.

251
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:02,878
You think these lowlifes take vacations
at the first sign of pressure?

252
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:06,949
No. The criminal element of this city
may be guilty of a lot of things...

253
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:09,450
...but being quitters ain't one of them.

254
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:12,586
You know, I don't even care
about Leo anymore.

255
00:23:12,756 --> 00:23:14,417
Kind of hope he never comes back.

256
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:17,425
Come on, aren't you being
a little hard on the guy?

257
00:23:17,595 --> 00:23:19,324
I don't know. It's possible.

258
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:22,523
I guess if I could live anywhere
other than the city, I'd go too.

259
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,861
But I could never leave this place.

260
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:29,165
I can't even sleep without the sound
of the subway rumbling over my head.

261
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,400
I guess it comes from growing up
with a houseful of brothers.

262
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:34,908
I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

263
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:39,072
I'm just saying that if it was my brother,
I'd find a way to work it out.

264
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,877
But that's just me.

265
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:44,043
I got my own issues, you know?
Like back at home, with April.

266
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:46,621
There's this whole thing
about settling down...

267
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,849
...that makes me miss the old times.

268
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:52,427
I don't know if I can be the grownup
she needs me to be.

269
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:59,132
Good talk, Raph.

270
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:27,957
Arise, my brothers. Arise, dear sister.

271
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:30,157
The Stars of Kikan align.

272
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:35,067
All ye generals,
wake from your stone slumber.

273
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:24,414
Dude.

274
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:28,216
Dude.

275
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:50,343
Enter.

276
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:53,706
Kneel, my son.

277
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:02,025
I return from my training, master.

278
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:07,357
I was so caught up in my own world,
I forgot about everyone else.

279
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:11,326
I'm sorry I failed.

280
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,137
On the contrary, my son...

281
00:26:19,476 --> 00:26:22,274
...now you are much stronger.

282
00:26:31,588 --> 00:26:34,056
Your strength is needed here now.

283
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:40,094
You owe me no apology,
but perhaps you should talk to Raphael.

284
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:44,564
Your absence has been
particularly difficult for him...

285
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:47,435
...though he'll never admit it.

286
00:26:47,604 --> 00:26:50,937
I'm certain things will be back to normal
in no time, master.

287
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:57,606
Good. Because until you can act as one,
you are forbidden to fight.

288
00:26:58,048 --> 00:27:00,016
Yes, sensei.

289
00:27:01,151 --> 00:27:03,949
I have missed you, Leonardo.

290
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:06,715
I've missed you too, Father.

291
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:09,290
Raphael.

292
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,395
Your brother is home.

293
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,335
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:22,834
Welcome home.

295
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:24,940
Yeah. Thanks.

296
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:29,239
Well, I'm going to bed.

297
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:35,241
Hey, Leo's back.
Better go say hello before he leaves again.

298
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:38,047
- What? Leo.
- Hey.

299
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:40,452
- Hey.
- Huh, Leo?

300
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:43,024
- Is that really you?
- Yeah.

301
00:27:43,193 --> 00:27:47,391
- I'm, like, dreaming, aren't I?
- No, Mikey, you're not dreaming.

302
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:52,001
Oh, good.
I have nightmares about birthday parties.

303
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:58,107
Okay, Leo, I'll bite.
What are we doing up here?

304
00:27:58,275 --> 00:28:01,335
I told Splinter
I'd get this team in shape again.

305
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:06,347
Hey, I've been training. Since you left,
my video-game scores have, like, doubled.

306
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:09,179
Right, and while you've been
playing games, brother...

307
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:11,514
...Nightwatcher's
come into the neighborhood...

308
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:14,680
...like some kind of vigilante showboat.
But his days are done.

309
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:16,689
Hey, you went AWOL, Leo...

310
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,988
...and the Nightwatcher
was the only guy to pick up the slack.

311
00:28:20,164 --> 00:28:23,190
Crime never took a break. You did.

312
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:27,201
I heard his bike turns into a plane or,
like, a jetpack.

313
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:30,431
Hey, Don, you're so smart,
why don't we have jetpacks?

314
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:33,770
That's good, Mikey. I don't even
trust you with a driver's license.

315
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:36,504
Have you seen
the way this guy behaves-

316
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:43,075
Someone's cranky.

317
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:49,151
- Okay, jungle boy. Grab a vine.
- Raph, wait.

318
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:50,987
Splinter told us not to fight.

319
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:54,153
"Jungle boy." Good one.

320
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,496
All right. But remember,
we're only up here for training.

321
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,639
You know what I always say,
"Train by doing, dude."

322
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:05,366
Mikey, when have you ever said that?

323
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,842
You smell that?
It's like a monkey cage up here.

324
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:14,673
Wow, good news is,
there's a bunch of Foot ninjas...

325
00:29:14,852 --> 00:29:17,184
...getting the snot kicked out of them.

326
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:25,186
Bad news is, this thing
is gonna run out of bodies soon.

327
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:28,331
Yeah, so?
You think we should help these guys?

328
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:31,900
I'd rather enjoy the show.
What do you say, fearless leader?

329
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:33,866
- We're not-
- I say we stop talking.

330
00:29:41,678 --> 00:29:43,270
Come here, fuzzy wuzzy.

331
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:45,812
You.

332
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:51,344
I think we're getting off
on the wrong foot here.

333
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:55,690
- We're trying to help you.
- Never.

334
00:29:57,694 --> 00:29:59,127
Team.

335
00:30:01,665 --> 00:30:04,463
Wait, the Shredder's dead.

336
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:08,037
Who are you working for?

337
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:14,970
Hey, a little help, O fearless one.

338
00:30:18,348 --> 00:30:21,317
That was too easy.

339
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:23,510
Like I said, too easy.

340
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,280
Bad dog.

341
00:30:33,397 --> 00:30:35,262
Look at me. Found the elevator.

342
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:40,159
Oh, my shoulder.

343
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:42,100
My spleen.

344
00:30:55,452 --> 00:30:57,044
This place needed a skylight.

345
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:04,718
This is why we need jetpacks.

346
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:08,524
- Okay, any more bright ideas?
- How about this?

347
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:16,433
When this is over,
I'm totally calling the architect.

348
00:31:56,213 --> 00:32:01,082
Wait a minute. How did something
that big just disappear? It doesn't-

349
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:03,753
Dude, it's the cops.

350
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:10,284
Raph. Raph!

351
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:21,365
Oh, yeah. The turtles are back, dudes.

352
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:25,474
I give us a 10 for style,
an eight for skill...

353
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:28,907
...and a two for stealth.

354
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:39,579
What seems to be the problem?

355
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:43,283
The problem is that we were hired
to merely patrol the city...

356
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,928
...and report anything strange to you.

357
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:50,756
You never said anything about monsters.

358
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:58,865
Now, I'm sorry that your illustrious group
have been reduced to hired guns...

359
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:02,808
...but I believe we made a deal, Karai.

360
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:05,174
And I expect you to honor it.

361
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:10,310
You do understand honor, don't you?

362
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:15,681
So how did we fare?

363
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:24,694
My, my, my. And what is your name?

364
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:29,970
Were there any problems, general?

365
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,131
None, my lord.

366
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:35,608
Then show these fools
how a true warrior acts.

367
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:37,974
Keep them on schedule
in completing their task.

368
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:39,809
We do not need any help.

369
00:33:39,983 --> 00:33:44,477
Nevertheless, Karai,
I trust my family more than I trust you.

370
00:33:44,654 --> 00:33:48,647
You may be the eyes and ears,
but they are the muscle.

371
00:33:48,825 --> 00:33:51,988
They will help you gather
the remaining 12 of these abominations...

372
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:55,495
...so we can finally see
our birthrights fulfilled.

373
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,991
It's going to be quite a party.

374
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:08,604
Dudes, did anyone get the license plate
of that thing that hit us last night?

375
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:10,110
My head.

376
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,478
Okay, that was just weird. I mean,
first the Foot, then that hideous monster.

377
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:18,678
Yeah. It looked like your mom, dude.

378
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:22,450
Yeah, that would make her
your mom too, doofus.

379
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:24,150
Yeah, whatever.

380
00:34:24,327 --> 00:34:26,659
Keep laughing.
Last night was an embarrassment.

381
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:30,095
I'll tell you what's embarrassing.
You can't follow a single order.

382
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:33,236
Oh, how cute.
You've been back for five minutes...

383
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:36,065
...and now you're schooling us
on your master plan?

384
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,332
Okay, so this is my fault now,
huh, Raph?

385
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:40,772
I'm the only one
that has to be responsible?

386
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:42,878
Hey, you're the trained master, not me.

387
00:34:43,046 --> 00:34:45,344
Dudes, can it. Here comes Splinter.

388
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,020
Good morning, my sons.

389
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:58,184
- Good morning, sensei.
- Sup?

390
00:35:02,866 --> 00:35:06,427
Every ninja's day should start
with a healthy breakfast.

391
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:11,370
It fills me with pride
to see you boys together again.

392
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:15,534
If anyone needs me,
I'll be watching my stories.

393
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,606
- Hothead.
- Splinter Jr.

394
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:24,317
Cody is going to break up with Donna.
I just know it.

395
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:27,786
We interrupt the Gilmore Girls
for this special news report.

396
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,550
Monsters loose in the city?

397
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:32,126
Strange reports are coming in
about an incident...

398
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:34,729
...that sounds like something
out of science fiction.

399
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:36,559
Boys!

400
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:41,934
Leonardo,
I am most disappointed in you.

401
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:44,300
You are the eldest of your brothers.

402
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:49,678
I was counting on you to bring order
to the chaos of this family.

403
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:53,873
This is why I have forbidden
any surface activity.

404
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,917
We cannot return to the surface
to fight evil...

405
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:59,555
...if we continue to fight each other.

406
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:02,317
But Master Splinter,
how can I be expected to do so-

407
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:06,485
There are no excuses
when you are the leader, my student.

408
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:13,024
We have to go out
and find who's responsible for this.

409
00:36:13,203 --> 00:36:14,602
There ain't no other solution.

410
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:17,763
Save the brute-vigilante junk
for that Nightwatchman.

411
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:19,272
- Nightwatcher.
- Nightwatcher.

412
00:36:19,442 --> 00:36:21,342
Yeah, whatever.

413
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:23,411
I'm going out.

414
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:25,594
Witnesses say
there are holes in the floors...

415
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:29,865
...as if something or someone had just
blasted straight down through them...

416
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,907
...leaving authorities
scratching their heads.

417
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:37,073
Well, at least some people
care about justice these days.

418
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:39,181
Hey, Casey.

419
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:41,674
- Raph?
- Meet me on the roof, okay?

420
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:43,443
What is it?

421
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,487
The roof.
You know what the roof is, don't you?

422
00:38:46,656 --> 00:38:48,146
Pushy sidekick.

423
00:38:48,324 --> 00:38:50,952
We've gotten this image
in from an amateur cameraman...

424
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:53,118
...and I do stress "amateur."

425
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:57,792
Casey, come look at this.

426
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:04,336
Be safe.

427
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:09,043
What's this all about, Raph?

428
00:39:09,212 --> 00:39:11,680
We got bigger things to worry about
than criminals.

429
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:13,372
Like what?

430
00:39:17,587 --> 00:39:19,077
Come on.

431
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:37,837
I think we lost it.

432
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:40,601
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

433
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:42,842
I don't think so.

434
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:53,314
What's going on, Raph?

435
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,617
Did I mention
we ran into a monster last night?

436
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:59,592
No, you kind of failed to tell me
about that one, buddy.

437
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,390
You do know I only have
a wooden bat, don't you?

438
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:12,532
The Foot? I thought they were history.

439
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:24,119
And now we got walking statues?
You got a plan for those?

440
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:26,915
Yeah. Hey, those are a first for me too.

441
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:29,689
And who knows?
These guys might be friendly.

442
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:37,222
Friendly.

443
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:47,607
Wait a second. Those statues look-

444
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:57,813
Witnesses.

445
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:00,888
Watch out.

446
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,051
I don't feel so good.

447
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:12,896
That can't be good.

448
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:17,936
That's just rude.

449
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:22,606
Hey, wait up.

450
00:41:24,013 --> 00:41:25,571
- Raph?
- Come here.

451
00:41:25,748 --> 00:41:28,842
- What, you never heard of smoke pellets?
- Warn me next time.

452
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:30,349
I got allergies.

453
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:35,149
Come on.
That's the second mask this week.

454
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:38,616
They'll never find us in here.

455
00:41:39,862 --> 00:41:43,320
Stay with me, now.
We'll be out of here soon.

456
00:41:50,006 --> 00:41:51,337
No.

457
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:55,109
And I thought Girl Scouts were pushy.

458
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:02,150
Some people just can't take a hint.

459
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:07,847
This is the police. You on the roof,
put your hands behind your...

460
00:42:08,658 --> 00:42:11,354
What is that? Tommy, you see this?

461
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:16,226
Yeah, you better run.

462
00:42:19,035 --> 00:42:20,730
I gotta hand it to you, Raph...

463
00:42:20,903 --> 00:42:23,633
...you sure know how
to show a lady a good time.

464
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:25,697
Raph?

465
00:42:27,343 --> 00:42:31,541
Oh, no.
I gotta get you someplace safe, pal.

466
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:38,151
My compliments to the chef.

467
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,159
Anyone for dessert?

468
00:42:45,328 --> 00:42:46,761
- No.
- Yes.

469
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:49,557
Cowabunga Carl Party Services.
Cowabunga, dude.

470
00:42:49,732 --> 00:42:52,997
- Raph 's hurt. You need to get over here.
- Slow down, April.

471
00:42:53,169 --> 00:42:56,195
- What happened to Raph?
- I don 't know. He's unconscious.

472
00:42:56,372 --> 00:42:58,169
We'll be right there.

473
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:09,010
Leo. You came back.

474
00:43:09,185 --> 00:43:10,880
Leo.

475
00:43:11,054 --> 00:43:13,989
Sorry the reunion
isn't under better circumstances.

476
00:43:15,224 --> 00:43:17,749
Nice pad, kids.

477
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:19,360
Oh, hey, Raph.

478
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:23,123
Well, his vital signs seem to be okay.

479
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:26,930
Pupil dilation is normal.

480
00:43:34,677 --> 00:43:38,943
Some sort of stone.
Probably obsidian, I think.

481
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:41,612
Well, is he gonna be all right?

482
00:43:42,218 --> 00:43:44,448
You're still here?
Go back to your jungle.

483
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,487
Well, at least
his personality's still intact.

484
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:51,388
And there's an engraving on it.
Looks South American.

485
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:54,428
That's your department, April.

486
00:43:57,066 --> 00:44:00,729
Would it help if I told you that those statues
you collected for Winters...

487
00:44:00,903 --> 00:44:03,599
...were shooting these things
at me and Raph?

488
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:09,968
"The legend of Yoatl." It can't be.

489
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,172
It was just a myth...

490
00:44:12,348 --> 00:44:15,875
...a scary story the locals told kids
around a campfire.

491
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:18,145
Whoa, what are you talking about?

492
00:44:19,222 --> 00:44:24,250
They say 3000 years ago,
some great warrior...

493
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:28,989
...actually found a portal
to another dimension.

494
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:37,701
And when the portal opened...

495
00:44:37,874 --> 00:44:41,503
...the energy from it
gave the warrior eternal life.

496
00:44:41,677 --> 00:44:45,943
But it also turned his generals to stone.

497
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:49,843
What if this warrior
just kept living forever?

498
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:52,988
He would spend
the rest of his days in regret...

499
00:44:53,156 --> 00:44:57,115
...spending all of his riches
and all of his power...

500
00:44:57,293 --> 00:45:00,387
...to find a way
to revive his stone generals.

501
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:08,299
Maybe, just maybe...

502
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:11,440
...he 's built a new empire.

503
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:29,754
But, hey, like I said, it' s just a myth.

504
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,891
If you ask me, guys,
this has Winters' name written all over it.

505
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:37,897
- How do you figure that, Donnie?
- Yeah.

506
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:41,935
Because this has Winters' name
written all over it.

507
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:44,698
Now I know who to thank
for this shot in the arm.

508
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:47,342
So where do we find this guy
and his stone jokers?

509
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,001
We're not going
until we get Splinter's blessing.

510
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:53,774
You're gonna quote a rulebook to me
that you ain't been following for a year?

511
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:57,249
If you got something you wanna
get off your shell, now's the time.

512
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,514
But I'm not gonna stand here
and debate Splinter's orders with you.

513
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:05,353
Fine, then. I quit.

514
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,422
Hey, Raph. Don't do it, man.

515
00:46:09,596 --> 00:46:14,056
Sometimes just taking a breather
is the best thing to do.

516
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:17,765
Whatever.

517
00:46:55,008 --> 00:46:57,476
To picking up the pieces.

518
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:00,746
What is it?

519
00:47:00,914 --> 00:47:04,509
Two creatures remain, my lord.

520
00:47:04,685 --> 00:47:08,678
Well, by all means, then,
let's finish it.

521
00:47:08,856 --> 00:47:13,452
And you will finally be free
of your stone prison.

522
00:47:13,627 --> 00:47:18,724
But if the curse is broken,
we will no longer be immortal.

523
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,769
Brother, do not question my command.

524
00:47:28,242 --> 00:47:30,710
- Here we go, now.
- So, what are we looking for?

525
00:47:30,878 --> 00:47:34,041
Well, according to these star charts,
the portal is set to open...

526
00:47:34,214 --> 00:47:38,116
...directly over Winters Tower
in the next 24 hours.

527
00:47:38,285 --> 00:47:41,379
So the legend is right.
Three thousand years.

528
00:47:41,555 --> 00:47:45,389
And when the portal opens,
we'll lose the city to monsters within hours.

529
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:50,394
Within days, the country.
And within weeks, the world.

530
00:47:52,332 --> 00:47:57,133
Oh, so it's like Halley's comet,
only monsters come out?

531
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:01,502
Yes. I guess so.

532
00:48:02,709 --> 00:48:04,802
I'm smart.

533
00:48:07,648 --> 00:48:08,979
I'm okay.

534
00:48:09,149 --> 00:48:10,707
Why do we need Raph, anyway?

535
00:48:10,884 --> 00:48:13,853
It's his temper that always
jeopardizes all our missions.

536
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:17,582
Okay, Leo. Whatever you say.
Nobody was talking about him.

537
00:48:18,192 --> 00:48:23,960
Leonardo, this team
you are so eager to lead is incomplete.

538
00:48:24,131 --> 00:48:26,827
You know what you must do.

539
00:48:28,502 --> 00:48:30,834
Yes, sensei.

540
00:48:40,948 --> 00:48:45,578
Generals, I think our brother
has plans to betray us.

541
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:51,089
The 13th monster must not be found.

542
00:48:54,428 --> 00:48:57,522
Why don 't we take one more call
about these monster sightings?

543
00:48:57,698 --> 00:48:59,928
Suffern, New Jersey, you're on.

544
00:49:01,235 --> 00:49:03,863
Monster sightings.

545
00:49:23,457 --> 00:49:26,688
A monster!

546
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,521
Attention, all on-duty officers:

547
00:49:28,695 --> 00:49:31,220
Report of a disturbance on 32nd.
No units available.

548
00:49:31,398 --> 00:49:33,423
They're playing my song.

549
00:49:36,703 --> 00:49:39,399
Where are the cops?
How come the cops haven't shown up?

550
00:49:39,573 --> 00:49:42,565
Just remember what my analyst said,
just go to my happy place.

551
00:49:42,743 --> 00:49:45,940
Everything's gonna be fine. Happy place.
I'm feeling good. I'm thin.

552
00:49:46,113 --> 00:49:48,946
Don't get up. I'll serve myself.

553
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:56,580
Look at you. Ain't you cute?

554
00:49:56,757 --> 00:50:00,352
You want a butt-kicking, little fella?
Yes, you do. You do.

555
00:50:00,527 --> 00:50:04,930
Come on, I'm gonna drop-kick you
to hurty town. Come on, little guy.

556
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:10,595
Get off of me, you little monster.

557
00:50:15,242 --> 00:50:17,267
You're scratching the helmet.

558
00:50:19,947 --> 00:50:22,279
Okay, that was different.

559
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:35,124
Hey, this thing ain't rustproof.
Get off of me.

560
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:48,971
Come on.

561
00:50:58,685 --> 00:51:00,812
How about a snack, little fella?

562
00:51:01,855 --> 00:51:03,345
Catch.

563
00:51:18,238 --> 00:51:20,866
Keep on running,
you filthy little hermit crab.

564
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:23,703
That spicy meatball's on the house.

565
00:51:24,244 --> 00:51:26,542
Big guy, please don't hurt me.

566
00:51:26,713 --> 00:51:29,113
What? I'm not robbing you,
I'm helping you.

567
00:51:29,282 --> 00:51:32,410
Okay, whatever you say, sir.
Please, I got kids in college.

568
00:51:32,586 --> 00:51:33,712
Community college.

569
00:51:34,054 --> 00:51:35,954
Here you go, pal.
Make sure this is safe.

570
00:51:36,123 --> 00:51:38,114
Take everything.
I'm not even looking. Go.

571
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:42,318
Why is it everyone's got such a hard time
believing I am a good guy?

572
00:51:42,496 --> 00:51:45,192
I just saved your life.

573
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:54,235
This night just keeps getting
better and better.

574
00:52:24,805 --> 00:52:26,170
Get off my car.

575
00:52:57,337 --> 00:53:00,534
I want you to know
that I appreciate your intentions...

576
00:53:00,707 --> 00:53:03,005
...but you can't change the world
like this.

577
00:53:03,577 --> 00:53:05,875
- The road you're on is a dead end.
- Is he kidding?

578
00:53:06,046 --> 00:53:07,775
- I've tried it.
- He's lecturing.

579
00:53:07,948 --> 00:53:10,508
So I'm gonna give you one chance
to just walk away...

580
00:53:10,684 --> 00:53:13,585
...and stop this vigilante nonsense.

581
00:53:14,454 --> 00:53:16,285
Okay, Leo...

582
00:53:16,456 --> 00:53:20,051
...time to teach you a lesson.

583
00:53:24,564 --> 00:53:28,398
Look, trust me when I tell you,
you don't wanna do this.

584
00:53:31,605 --> 00:53:34,870
Oh, yeah.
Well, I notice you got quite a temper.

585
00:53:37,177 --> 00:53:39,407
Hey, have you ever done this before?

586
00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:44,874
Oh, come on. You call that an attack?

587
00:53:53,426 --> 00:53:56,793
All right. Finally, some excitement.

588
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,933
Funny thing about anger:

589
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,772
Let it consume you,
and soon enough...

590
00:54:15,749 --> 00:54:19,116
...you lose sight of everything.

591
00:54:30,197 --> 00:54:32,358
Good night, dark prince.

592
00:54:36,136 --> 00:54:37,626
Raph?

593
00:54:39,139 --> 00:54:40,265
What?

594
00:54:43,276 --> 00:54:45,608
You are so smug, you know that?

595
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:48,145
You think the world revolves around you,
don't you?

596
00:54:48,315 --> 00:54:51,284
We couldn't survive without
the mighty and powerful Leonardo...

597
00:54:51,451 --> 00:54:53,282
...to guide us through our problems.

598
00:54:53,453 --> 00:54:57,116
Well, I got a news flash for you:
We got along just fine without you.

599
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:02,159
Oh, and this qualifies as "just fine"?
Dressing up like it's Halloween every night?

600
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:06,265
Risking the safety of our family?
I mean, come on, what were you thinking?

601
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:08,731
Don't push it.
You can't leave and come back...

602
00:55:08,902 --> 00:55:11,735
...expecting us to fall in line
like your little soldiers.

603
00:55:11,905 --> 00:55:16,569
Hey, I was training.
Training to be a better leader, for you.

604
00:55:16,743 --> 00:55:20,076
- Why do you hate me for that?
- And whoever said I wanted to be led?

605
00:55:20,247 --> 00:55:23,114
I'm better off calling my own shots now.
Get used to it.

606
00:55:23,283 --> 00:55:27,219
You aren't ready.
You're impatient and hot-tempered.

607
00:55:27,387 --> 00:55:31,323
And more importantly,
I'm better than you.

608
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,228
Oh, you know something, big brother?

609
00:55:35,395 --> 00:55:38,887
I'd have to disagree with you
on that one.

610
00:55:41,534 --> 00:55:43,331
Don't do this, Raph.

611
00:55:44,337 --> 00:55:46,771
I'm done taking orders.

612
00:57:51,731 --> 00:57:53,164
Not human...

613
00:57:53,633 --> 00:57:57,967
...but clearly not the final monster.

614
00:57:58,738 --> 00:58:01,901
Yoatl won't know the difference.

615
00:58:02,075 --> 00:58:07,672
By the time our brother discovers
this turtle is not the 13th monster...

616
00:58:08,048 --> 00:58:11,745
...it will already be too late.

617
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:17,650
Leo.

618
00:58:31,204 --> 00:58:34,469
Leo. Hang on.

619
00:58:37,877 --> 00:58:40,107
Leo.

620
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,071
Leo.

621
00:58:52,892 --> 00:58:56,293
No!

622
00:59:15,782 --> 00:59:19,013
Raphael. What is the matter?

623
00:59:19,185 --> 00:59:21,517
I was out. I was out and I did-
I did something.

624
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:24,657
Something happened
and then I- And I...

625
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:29,227
Raphael. Kneel.

626
00:59:30,663 --> 00:59:32,494
I did something.

627
00:59:32,665 --> 00:59:34,997
I did something really stupid,
Master Splinter.

628
00:59:36,136 --> 00:59:37,728
Go on.

629
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:40,696
I know why you chose him now.

630
00:59:40,874 --> 00:59:44,776
I know that there's a reason
why he's the better son and I'm not.

631
00:59:44,944 --> 00:59:50,974
Raphael, you always bear
the world's problems on your shoulders.

632
00:59:51,151 --> 00:59:57,420
It is an admirable quality
when you are a protector of others.

633
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:03,620
But you must realize that while, at times,
you may not be my favorite student...

634
01:00:03,796 --> 01:00:08,290
...it does not mean
that you are my least-favorite son.

635
01:00:08,468 --> 01:00:13,531
You are strong, passionate
and loyal to a fault.

636
01:00:13,706 --> 01:00:17,699
These are the merits
of a great leader as well...

637
01:00:17,877 --> 01:00:22,075
...but only when tempered
with compassion and humility.

638
01:00:22,248 --> 01:00:25,706
But, Master Splinter,
I messed up big tonight.

639
01:00:25,885 --> 01:00:28,376
I mean big.

640
01:00:31,491 --> 01:00:32,981
They took him.

641
01:00:39,766 --> 01:00:41,529
Leonardo.

642
01:00:42,168 --> 01:00:43,726
Yeah.

643
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:53,543
Then the time for hiding is over.

644
01:00:53,713 --> 01:00:59,379
We must return to the surface
to take back what is ours.

645
01:01:01,154 --> 01:01:04,248
By your wish, Father.

646
01:01:07,093 --> 01:01:11,325
Long have we been in hiding.
Perhaps too long.

647
01:01:11,497 --> 01:01:14,557
Well, what do we do now?

648
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:16,463
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

649
01:01:16,636 --> 01:01:21,005
We're gonna rescue our brother,
and then we're gonna save New York City.

650
01:02:27,774 --> 01:02:30,800
I got it on my last trip to Japan.
You like it?

651
01:02:30,977 --> 01:02:32,877
Oh, yeah.

652
01:02:34,981 --> 01:02:37,176
No way.

653
01:02:39,652 --> 01:02:42,018
You can't go trick-or-treating
without your mask.

654
01:02:43,056 --> 01:02:46,082
Oh, babe. Thanks.

655
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:05,833
As ordered,
no one gets into the tower...

656
01:03:06,012 --> 01:03:11,177
...no one interferes,
no one bears witness.

657
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,224
You've got to be kidding me.

658
01:03:25,465 --> 01:03:29,561
Cowabunga, dude. I'm here
for little Maxie's 13th birthday party.

659
01:03:29,736 --> 01:03:31,067
Leave now.

660
01:03:31,237 --> 01:03:34,070
Oh, but you don't understand, lady.
I got...

661
01:04:22,188 --> 01:04:28,058
At last. After 3000 years,
the time is finally at hand.

662
01:04:48,581 --> 01:04:51,982
What-? What have you done?

663
01:04:52,852 --> 01:04:55,821
Your time for giving orders is over.

664
01:04:56,022 --> 01:04:57,387
You don't understand.

665
01:04:57,557 --> 01:04:59,582
I want to send these creatures back...

666
01:04:59,759 --> 01:05:02,421
...to undo the damage
that was done so many years ago.

667
01:05:02,595 --> 01:05:05,655
Time has done nothing
but made you weak.

668
01:05:05,832 --> 01:05:08,096
We have our own plans.

669
01:05:08,267 --> 01:05:10,462
Immortality is a curse, brother.

670
01:05:10,636 --> 01:05:13,036
Trust me, I've lived long enough to know.

671
01:05:13,206 --> 01:05:16,334
We have to find that 13th monster.
It's time to end it.

672
01:05:16,509 --> 01:05:18,101
No.

673
01:05:19,412 --> 01:05:22,609
Our time is just beginning.

674
01:05:45,204 --> 01:05:47,672
- Little help, Don.
- I'm on it.

675
01:05:57,850 --> 01:05:59,818
Heads up, dudes.

676
01:05:59,986 --> 01:06:02,147
Goal.

677
01:06:05,825 --> 01:06:08,589
Guys, front door's open. Now.

678
01:06:08,995 --> 01:06:11,520
Two minutes for high sticking.

679
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:18,962
Dudes, that rocked. Let's go again.

680
01:06:28,848 --> 01:06:31,942
- Dudes, what do we do?
- I'm working on it.

681
01:06:33,219 --> 01:06:35,084
You break it, you buy it.

682
01:06:40,192 --> 01:06:42,251
Yeah. All right.

683
01:06:42,428 --> 01:06:45,056
All right. Nice.

684
01:06:45,231 --> 01:06:48,359
- Nice work, Jones.
- I have my moments.

685
01:06:48,534 --> 01:06:50,559
Whoa, check it out.

686
01:06:50,736 --> 01:06:54,331
That would be the swirling vortex
to another world, I assume.

687
01:06:54,507 --> 01:06:56,498
Cool. I want one.

688
01:06:59,612 --> 01:07:01,102
Leo, is that you?

689
01:07:03,049 --> 01:07:04,846
Sorry, wrong cage.

690
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,553
- Leo. I got him.
- Out of the way, please.

691
01:07:17,863 --> 01:07:21,128
Hey, buddy. Come on, man. Up we go.

692
01:07:21,734 --> 01:07:23,599
There you go.

693
01:07:34,847 --> 01:07:38,146
You're gonna need these
if you're gonna lead us out of here.

694
01:07:39,785 --> 01:07:42,049
I'm gonna need you too.

695
01:07:48,728 --> 01:07:51,788
- Winters.
- Looks more like fall. Get it?

696
01:07:51,964 --> 01:07:53,659
Mikey, remember our talk.

697
01:07:56,602 --> 01:07:59,298
Looks like someone got to him
before us.

698
01:08:02,308 --> 01:08:03,798
Is he dead?

699
01:08:09,215 --> 01:08:11,581
Not so immortal, huh, dudes?

700
01:08:15,488 --> 01:08:18,457
Your time's run out, Winters.

701
01:08:19,058 --> 01:08:20,548
Miss O'Neil.

702
01:08:20,726 --> 01:08:25,288
I must have hit my head pretty hard.
I'm seeing giant turtles.

703
01:08:25,464 --> 01:08:28,433
We know what you're up to, Winters.
We know about the portal...

704
01:08:28,601 --> 01:08:31,866
...and we think that it's time
you sent all these monsters home.

705
01:08:35,441 --> 01:08:37,272
I couldn't agree with you more.

706
01:08:37,443 --> 01:08:41,436
It is time to put an end to the curse
that I have brought upon myself...

707
01:08:41,614 --> 01:08:43,912
...and this world.

708
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:48,486
That's what this is about, Miss O'Neil:
Penance.

709
01:08:48,654 --> 01:08:53,956
I must return all 13 beasts
or our curse will continue.

710
01:08:54,126 --> 01:08:58,563
And that is a torment
I can no longer bear.

711
01:08:58,731 --> 01:09:02,827
Then you should be
put out of your misery.

712
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:06,936
I think we walked in
on a family feud, guys.

713
01:09:07,206 --> 01:09:12,041
The time has come to reopen the portal
and rain destruction upon the Earth.

714
01:09:12,211 --> 01:09:14,179
Nothing will stand in our way...

715
01:09:14,346 --> 01:09:17,315
...when we have an army
at our command.

716
01:09:17,483 --> 01:09:21,010
- My brothers, I-
- We are no brothers to you.

717
01:09:21,187 --> 01:09:26,989
With one monster still free,
the curse will never be broken.

718
01:09:27,159 --> 01:09:31,596
We shall finish what we began
all those years ago.

719
01:09:31,764 --> 01:09:34,528
And we will finally have our victory.

720
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,669
Join us. Join us, Foot Clan.

721
01:09:37,837 --> 01:09:41,773
Swear your allegiance to us
and no harm will befall you.

722
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:49,507
The Foot ninja is not without honor.
We work for Winters, not you.

723
01:09:54,019 --> 01:09:56,317
Okay, what does that mean?

724
01:09:56,489 --> 01:09:59,481
It means we're going to help you.

725
01:09:59,658 --> 01:10:04,561
My ninja will find the last monster
and you will bring it back here.

726
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:06,459
Hurry, we don't have much time.

727
01:10:10,102 --> 01:10:12,502
Hey. I got shotgun.

728
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:14,229
Forget about them.

729
01:10:14,406 --> 01:10:18,240
By the time they return,
the portal will already be closed...

730
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:21,038
...with you inside it.

731
01:10:21,313 --> 01:10:23,372
I hate to see brothers fight like this.

732
01:10:23,549 --> 01:10:26,416
Unless it's together.

733
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:32,816
Hate to rain on your parade, pal,
but we thought we'd even the odds.

734
01:10:32,992 --> 01:10:35,961
We're going to enjoy this.

735
01:10:41,934 --> 01:10:45,165
If you please. They can defeat them.

736
01:10:45,337 --> 01:10:47,669
They are a team.

737
01:10:48,107 --> 01:10:51,543
Let's hope so, because if not,
Aguila will use the portal...

738
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:56,943
...to draw forth an army of evil
and the world will be lost.

739
01:10:58,684 --> 01:11:02,916
More beasts.
Let's send them back where they belong.

740
01:11:08,928 --> 01:11:10,589
Temper, temper.

741
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:26,907
Come to daddy.

742
01:11:33,752 --> 01:11:36,448
Thing about you immortal stone guys is...

743
01:11:36,622 --> 01:11:39,318
...you know, you're immortal
and made of stone.

744
01:11:39,491 --> 01:11:41,482
I sound like Mikey.

745
01:11:42,828 --> 01:11:45,888
You fight well. You should join us.

746
01:11:46,198 --> 01:11:48,564
No, thanks, I'm good.

747
01:11:57,309 --> 01:12:00,676
These guys really don't die.
Sensei, are you all right?

748
01:12:01,847 --> 01:12:04,179
We must do this more often.

749
01:12:06,986 --> 01:12:08,783
I still got it.

750
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:13,922
They'd better hurry
with that last monster.

751
01:12:14,093 --> 01:12:16,960
I'm sure my man Casey's
got it all under control.

752
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:20,398
That's what I'm afraid of.

753
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:27,799
Can't this piece of junk go faster?

754
01:12:27,973 --> 01:12:30,032
- Wanna drive?
- I would, as a matter of fact.

755
01:12:30,209 --> 01:12:36,114
You would think they would be
more concerned about the 13th monster.

756
01:13:00,739 --> 01:13:03,037
Boys, we must finish this now.

757
01:13:28,701 --> 01:13:30,191
So did we win?

758
01:13:37,476 --> 01:13:41,913
Foolish creatures.
We are immortals made of stone.

759
01:13:42,081 --> 01:13:44,845
Without the final monster
to break our curse...

760
01:13:45,017 --> 01:13:48,009
...we will never be stopped.

761
01:13:50,389 --> 01:13:52,220
Special delivery.

762
01:13:58,197 --> 01:13:59,391
Look out.

763
01:14:40,372 --> 01:14:42,602
So did we win now?

764
01:14:42,775 --> 01:14:45,539
- Yeah, I think we did.
- We won.

765
01:14:45,711 --> 01:14:46,871
- All right.
- Yeah!

766
01:14:47,046 --> 01:14:50,015
All right. That's what I'm talking about.

767
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:51,747
Yeah!

768
01:14:52,351 --> 01:14:54,546
Nice parallel parking.

769
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:57,985
Next time, I'm driving.

770
01:15:02,294 --> 01:15:04,990
Hey. Watch the hair.

771
01:15:09,768 --> 01:15:13,431
Typical. We do all the work,
he gets all the thanks.

772
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:22,779
You are every bit the warriors
I was informed you were.

773
01:15:22,948 --> 01:15:24,438
You have passed.

774
01:15:24,616 --> 01:15:27,551
Savor your victory tonight.

775
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:31,621
For soon, we will have
further business together.

776
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:36,489
The kind that involves familiar faces
from your past.

777
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:39,756
She doesn't mean...

778
01:15:44,837 --> 01:15:49,001
Come on. What is it with ninjas
and smoke pellets?

779
01:15:55,247 --> 01:15:57,511
Looks like you picked a good time
to come home.

780
01:15:57,683 --> 01:16:01,483
Thanks for bringing me back.

781
01:16:06,492 --> 01:16:07,982
Winters?

782
01:16:12,865 --> 01:16:15,561
I'm never usually that happy
to be in pain.

783
01:16:15,734 --> 01:16:18,726
He's happy because he's mortal again,
Mikey.

784
01:16:18,904 --> 01:16:22,135
April. I've had my eye on you
for a long time.

785
01:16:22,307 --> 01:16:23,774
I knew it.

786
01:16:23,942 --> 01:16:29,744
I've always known that you'd be the one
to help me find my way home.

787
01:16:31,049 --> 01:16:32,744
And thank you...

788
01:16:33,118 --> 01:16:34,813
...brothers.

789
01:16:34,987 --> 01:16:41,324
You've made a very old man
very, very happy.

790
01:16:42,327 --> 01:16:45,626
So, what happens now?

791
01:17:29,875 --> 01:17:34,107
Okay. Just a little bit creepy.

792
01:17:35,013 --> 01:17:40,474
Oh, gross. I think he's in my no-
My no- My no-

793
01:17:43,155 --> 01:17:45,851
Gross. Somebody give me a hankie.

794
01:17:47,526 --> 01:17:49,756
Now he's in my mouth.

795
01:17:49,928 --> 01:17:52,328
Tastes awful.

796
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:24,928
You got room for one more?

797
01:18:42,281 --> 01:18:45,216
Can I get rid of this too?

798
01:19:02,134 --> 01:19:04,500
We live together. We train together.

799
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:08,197
We fight together.
We stand for good, together.

800
01:19:08,373 --> 01:19:10,364
We are ninjas.

801
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:15,878
We strike hard, defend, protect,
and fade into the night.

802
01:19:16,048 --> 01:19:19,211
And there ain't no bad guy or monster
gonna ever change that.

803
01:19:19,384 --> 01:19:21,147
That's what's important.

804
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:25,154
And that's why
we'll always be brothers.

805
01:19:26,725 --> 01:19:29,489
Oh, I love being a turtle.

806
01:19:30,305 --> 01:20:30,498
