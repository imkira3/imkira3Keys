00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,288
The situation on the
ground is ongoing

3
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,826
while the entire disputed area remains
closed to news organizations.

4
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:04,429
As last night's report of a
series of large explosions

5
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:09,901
awaits official confirmation, widespread
fear of a biological weapons launch

6
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,437
continues to spread
throughout the region.

7
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:18,076
Justine, what are you
seeing in the capital?

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,712
The Foreign Ministry remains
shuttered for a second day

9
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,448
as evidence mounts that the
insurgents may have used

10
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,452
at least some part of their long-rumored
biological weapons stockpile

11
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,554
in the course of last
night's incursion.

12
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,091
Have you been able to get any
word yet on the government's response?

13
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:37,629
Well, it's hard to find any officials
here at all in the capital, Mark.

14
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,032
But those who are willing
to speak off the record

15
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:45,804
confirm the regime's plan for a massive
retaliation in the next five to seven days.

16
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:49,274
Well, while we are trying
to restore that image,

17
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:54,146
ITL News has just obtained amateur
video footage purporting to show

18
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:57,883
casualties from last night's
exchange of missile fire.

19
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:03,655
A warning... this footage contains images
that may be disturbing to some viewers.

20
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:08,327
Obtained from a junior military officer
fleeing the site of last night's clashes,

21
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:12,030
it seems to belie assurances
from both sides of the conflict

22
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:15,267
- that no chemical or biological weapons...
- Damn it.

23
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,902
Have been deployed.

24
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:22,608
Such images are horrifying enough, but
there's an even more horrific scenario

25
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,779
if the contagion spreads beyond the
region, potentially infecting tens...

26
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,482
if not hundreds of thousands.

27
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,589
- They're saying...
- Look, I'm...

28
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,958
if you want, I'm just gonna
go to the guitar shop.

29
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,061
The pickup fried out, so...

30
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,105
They can't just keep
fighting, right?

31
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,407
We are now going
live to a press conference

32
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,442
at the Centers for Disease Control.

33
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:02,013
As of 8:00 a.m. Eastern Standard
Time, the CDC has not measured

34
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,050
any airborne contaminants
beyond a 100-mile radius

35
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,120
of last night's advance
in the Middle East.

36
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:13,358
What this... what this means is the
continental United States has not

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,362
and will not be affected by the
reported use of these pathogens.

38
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,931
Steven, the
situation in the larger cities

39
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:25,570
near the epicenter of the conflict remains
tense as persistent rumors of mass deaths

40
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,473
in scores of towns and
villages gain credibility.

41
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,676
At least three regional governments
have begun issuing gas masks...

42
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,745
Rumors abound in the capital

43
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:37,182
as the prime minister and his
cabinet depart the city...

44
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:42,287
This is simply a precaution

45
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,457
in order for us to maintain

46
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,759
government function...

47
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,595
Meanwhile,
a veritable exodus of refugees

48
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,831
continues to stream
across regional borders,

49
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:57,402
desperately seeking safety from a threat that
remains, perhaps intentionally, undefined.

50
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,605
In Washington, the
president has issued a statement

51
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,709
urging calm and affirming that no
known pathogen poses any threat...

52
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,611
The trade winds
are spreading the pathogen

53
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,680
well beyond the conflict's borders,

54
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,817
confirming officials' worst
fears about the airborne virus.

55
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:17,222
Reports of mass casualties as far north as
Italy and Portugal are pending confirmation.

56
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,357
What we're
apparently seeing here is a virus,

57
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,861
or a complex of viruses, killing
some almost immediately,

58
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,729
while leaving others fully mobile.

59
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:29,067
However, within hours, nobody in
the affected area remains alive.

60
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:33,805
Stay tuned, please, for further
developments on this breaking news story.

61
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,708
That pickup's all right.

62
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,444
But when I move around...

63
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,981
it doesn't have that punch
and it's just fading out a lot.

64
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,750
- Don't worry...
- All right, so...

65
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,688
Okay, cool. Thanks, man.

66
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,532
He says it's gonna
be, like, an hour.

67
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,202
There's something...

68
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,709
- I am so hungry.
- Oh.

69
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,947
I don't even know why
we're fighting this thing.

70
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,917
- It was the fucking dishes.
- Yes!

71
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,986
You guys have maids, you know?

72
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,088
So it's not like you see a
dirty dish and you're like,

73
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,991
"Hey, here's a dirty dish. I've
got to do something about it.

74
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,792
I'm gonna wash this dirty dish."

75
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,561
- You're...
- What are you... I mean...

76
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,042
You're totally fixated on this.

77
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:33,290
It's not the dish. I'm not even
talking about the dish anymore.

78
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:34,332
It's a metaphor.

79
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,835
- Yeah, it's a metaphor...
- I know what you're gonna say.

80
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,104
- No, you don't.
- The dish is a metaphor

81
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:42,140
for my anxiety about
how different we are.

82
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,445
What?

83
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:51,249
- You did know.
- Well, of course I knew.

84
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,687
- So, fuck it.
- Just wash the dish.

85
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,208
Just metaphor the metaphor.

86
00:05:57,234 --> 00:06:00,358
Just address my anxieties
with dishwashing liquid.

87
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,033
We'd miss this if we ever lost it.

88
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,603
We'd be like, "I wish
we could go back

89
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:15,708
to when the worst thing we had
to worry about was the dishes."

90
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,779
Hey.

91
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,481
Hey.

92
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:27,485
Oh, my God. You guys,
congratulations!

93
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:32,724
Let me see. Oh, my God.
That is so adorable.

94
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,061
So what's going on with
this shit in the news?

95
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,732
- Honestly, I'm not watching it.
- Don't know, right?

96
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,902
- Nothing's changed.
- I am going to go to the bathroom.

97
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,904
Oh.

98
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,206
Ahem.

99
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,195
Although state
and county authorities

100
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:14,065
have been almost unanimous in
urging residents to remain calm,

101
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:18,236
a spreading, seemingly spontaneous
exodus along the Eastern Seaboard

102
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,472
has caused state highway
patrol officials

103
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:24,609
to shut down six major northbound
arteries, piecing together...

104
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,692
Traffic's insane out there.

105
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,864
Did you guys eat my food?

106
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,969
I got you this.

107
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:06,384
Anna, why have you been
so freaked out lately?

108
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,029
So, what, I'm not allowed to talk
to any girl I've ever slept with?

109
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,266
Are you gonna go crazy? Is that it?

110
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:25,871
No, it's the exact opposite.

111
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,540
I think you should talk to
all the people you want to...

112
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:32,544
any girl you've ever met,

113
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,713
whenever they call,
whenever they stop by,

114
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,881
whenever you bump into them.

115
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:41,586
Yeah, I think you should take as many
opportunities as possible to talk to them.

116
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,288
Jesus, Anna.

117
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,957
Because, God, there is so
much time, isn't there?

118
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,228
There is so much time between
all the dishes lying around,

119
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,631
the fucked-up amps,
the fried-out pickups,

120
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,201
your rich grandparents...

121
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,903
and your boring,
stupid ex-girlfriends

122
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:02,173
coming to the "Gates
of fucking India"?

123
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,476
You know?

124
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:08,046
Because between all that,

125
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,649
there's so much time for...

126
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,852
laying in the bathtub...

127
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,289
and reading the soap bottle...

128
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,762
and looking out together,
up at the leaves...

129
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,398
and holding each other,

130
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,669
because we're both so happy

131
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,372
that we're actually scared.

132
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:44,883
Because if it really is all over...

133
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,285
Erik, if it was just us,

134
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:51,689
and there really was
nothing left on Earth...

135
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,799
What are you doing?

136
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,201
No, Anna, Anna,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

137
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,436
That's the song.

138
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,106
That... that is the song.

139
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,076
Those are the lyrics to our song.

140
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,078
That's it.

141
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,982
It's gonna be beautiful.

142
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:36,768
No one is willing to
confirm or deny what we're seeing here.

143
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,670
It clearly isn't benign.

144
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:42,040
Even at this distance, David,
I've got to admit, I'm scared.

145
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,108
We're getting
unconfirmed reports of rioting

146
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,012
at dozens of airports as all domestic and
international flights remain grounded.

147
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,282
Hundreds of
thousands of people are now running

148
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,451
through the streets here
seeking any kind of shelter.

149
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,687
The president and
his cabinet have been evacuated

150
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:59,457
to an undisclosed location while
assuring local authorities...

151
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,392
as yet
another American city reports

152
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,162
an almost unbelievable
casualty rate...

153
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,832
I, the Lord, have held
My peace a long time...

154
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,802
Just in the last
several minutes, it's really...

155
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,137
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

156
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,273
We are no longer receiving reports

157
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,842
from the following cities
and municipalities...

158
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,678
Boston and the Boston
metropolitan area,

159
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,415
- Bridgeport and the...
- Philadelphia...

160
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,885
- Baltimore...
- "Then the fifth angel

161
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,053
poured out his bowel
on the throne of the beast,

162
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,656
and His kingdom became
full of darkness

163
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,525
and they gnawed their tongues
because of the pain..."

164
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,629
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, my God.

165
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:42,467
- Oh, my God.
- "They shall become refuse on the ground."

166
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,557
The following is a bulletin from
the Emergency Management Agency.

167
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,527
If concentrations in your area have
exceeded 80 parts per billion,

168
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:14,599
you must take immediate shelter and remain
where you are for a minimum of eight days.

169
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,168
State authorities will continue
to broadcast hourly updates

170
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,004
as long as emergency networks
remain operational.

171
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:27,645
What does that even mean,
"parts per billion"?

172
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,448
Per billion what?

173
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,252
Per billion of whatever else
was out there, I guess.

174
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,460
It's a beautiful day.

175
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,698
Not a cloud in the sky.

176
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,538
We could read something.

177
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,542
Sure.

178
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,098
Remember this?

179
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,334
Oh, that.

180
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,104
That was a moment of weakness.

181
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:37,181
Well, at least we're not
going to get divorced now.

182
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,450
It's so clear out, baby.

183
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,387
The birds up there, they're
just flying around.

184
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:45,923
It's too bad we aren't birds.

185
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,159
I wonder what they're feeling.

186
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,030
Like their favorite
TV show got canceled.

187
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,738
I could talk to you
for another 20 years.

188
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,473
Aw, shut up.

189
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,343
I mean it. I was just
thinking it the other day.

190
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,579
I just realized that...

191
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,549
that you're my wife.

192
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:17,288
It took me practically till
just now to really believe it.

193
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,687
We're going to have
to go to Children's.

194
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,825
What?

195
00:14:56,628 --> 00:15:00,064
There are no more canisters here.

196
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,440
We're going to have to go
to Children's Hospital.

197
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,442
Okay.

198
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:35,133
- Oh, my God.
- Don't look.

199
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:39,036
Oh, God. That looks like...

200
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,506
that sweet nurse in Cardiology.

201
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,041
Sarah. Her name was Sarah.

202
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,744
Sarah.

203
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,148
Sarah? Sarah. Sarah.

204
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,683
- Mr. Sachs, I...
- Wait a minute.

205
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,886
Look, I know you're busy, but
I need a favor from you.

206
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:32,356
It's for my wife. She's in there
waiting to see Dr. Henderson.

207
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,991
They took her off life support.

208
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,994
They took her out of ICU.
We're just waiting, Sarah.

209
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,529
Well, we have an emergency...

210
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,898
Well, this is an emergency!
You understand?!

211
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,035
This is an emergency,
Sarah! She's dying!

212
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:47,305
And the doctor's just taken
a three-hour coffee break.

213
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,409
- Mr. Sachs...
- I'm sorry.

214
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,644
I know you're a good person.

215
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,646
Esther and I really think of you

216
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:59,317
as someone close to us,
like you're really family.

217
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,220
Please, I'm begging you.
Just come with me.

218
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,122
Help me. Help me get her
to ICU. Come on.

219
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:09,360
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do
that. We have an emergency... Mr. Sachs?

220
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,029
Mr. Sachs!

221
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,698
Jacob! Get me an oxygen unit.

222
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,135
- Jacob, get me an oxygen unit, now.
- Yes, right.

223
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:24,008
Mr. Sachs? Lift your
head up for me.

224
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,582
Try to breathe normally.

225
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,354
- Okay?
- Yeah.

226
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,289
- I've gotta go.
- Wait, wait.

227
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,325
Listen to me.

228
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,527
It's a biological attack.

229
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,396
- Isn't it?
- They don't know.

230
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,998
People can't breathe...

231
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,200
old people...

232
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,301
kids...

233
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,603
animals are okay.

234
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,273
We only have about three hours...

235
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:04,282
It has to do with how much
material is in the air.

236
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,450
And winds and...

237
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,987
if it gets up to more than
35 parts per billion,

238
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:13,557
you're going to need one of
these to survive, Sarah.

239
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,327
Now listen to me. Listen.
You got to get one.

240
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:20,364
Not a charcoal filter. Pure oxygen.

241
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,301
You'll be able to last
eight days. Okay?

242
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,637
Thank you. Thank you very much.

243
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,739
Good luck.

244
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,776
Nurse!

245
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,347
I have to go!

246
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,823
"Connect me to something.

247
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:49,593
Give me something,"
I said. You know?

248
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,796
"Give me something, Counsel.

249
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:56,300
Give me something that connects
my client eating baba ghanoush

250
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,736
at some streetside cafe

251
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,839
somewhere in...

252
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,142
do we even know where
this was taken, Tracy?"

253
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,011
And then Tracy said...

254
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:11,549
And then I said, "No, the prosecution
just gave us Exhibit 345,

255
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,685
defendants Hightower,
Esselen, and Sachs

256
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:18,789
and 'unidentified man.' 1979."

257
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:25,262
"So, please. Help me out here,"
I said, looking sort of baffled.

258
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:30,534
"Give me whatever it is you're hanging your
case on so that I can defend my client.

259
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:34,772
But don't keep giving me
exhibit after exhibit,

260
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,041
so-called 'fact' after
so-called 'fact'

261
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:40,544
that doesn't add up
to A... trade secrets,

262
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:45,383
B... any of your employees actually
compromising your trade secrets, or C...

263
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,753
any material damages done to your
company's overseas interests,

264
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:52,256
because if opposing
counsel doesn't or can't,

265
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,725
or for whatever
reason, they won't...

266
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,162
Your Honor, I respectfully request

267
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:01,932
that you dismiss the
case against my client."

268
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,470
And the judge dismissed it.

269
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,145
You guys? We're...

270
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,547
we're evacuating the building.

271
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,455
The news, then a proliferation

272
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,925
of rumors and hearsay, and then
almost street by street...

273
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,461
Hey, man. Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

274
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,467
Hey, man. I'm leaving
a message, dude.

275
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,503
Did you... if you're watching TV,

276
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,573
there's a...

277
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,543
anyway, turn on the TV.

278
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,445
It has something to
do with the war.

279
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,114
We're supposed to...

280
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,485
conflicting reports
of trade winds...

281
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,555
So, um...

282
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,390
meet me back at the house.

283
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,659
And...

284
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,962
please change your outgoing
message, though, baby.

285
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,664
Seriously.

286
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,532
But efforts to keep citizens calm

287
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,801
and encourage them to
maintain their normal...

288
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,103
I'm gonna take you
left, then right...

289
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,839
- Ah!
- Busted!

290
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:17,541
Surprise myself!

291
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,610
Ah! Take it back right here.

292
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,746
And then I'm gonna score again.

293
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,653
Perfect defense.

294
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,858
Oh, yeah! That's game, baby!

295
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,459
- No, no, no.
- That's game.

296
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,728
No.

297
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,898
Okay, so here's the deal.

298
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,236
If I sink this, right here,
you let me pay you back.

299
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,372
You don't owe me anything, man.

300
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:52,276
You see, that's exactly the kind of talk
that won't be allowed if I make this shot.

301
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,115
What happens if you miss?

302
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,150
Uh...

303
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,355
You know, this is really gonna
determine my inner morality.

304
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:07,191
If I miss, then you never
have to hear about it again.

305
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,126
How's that? Okay?

306
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:11,929
Borrowed your Jeep, fucked up
the transmission, we're square.

307
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:15,165
But if I make it, you
accept the cash.

308
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,005
All right, I'll trust
your subconscious.

309
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,607
You hear that, Rick's subconscious?

310
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,377
You don't really want him
to make this shot, do ya?

311
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:29,113
Make him miss.

312
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,015
You're just... you're
gonna stand right there?

313
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,783
You never said anything
about where I could stand.

314
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:35,185
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

315
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,887
It doesn't really matter.
That doesn't bother me.

316
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,489
- 'Cause you know why?
- Why?

317
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,658
'Cause I got it like that.

318
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,766
I give up.

319
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:02,846
Nice work on the Sachs case.

320
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,848
Thanks.

321
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,485
Where are you going?

322
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,921
Home.

323
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,190
That's it?

324
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,125
That's it.

325
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:20,331
Whatever.

326
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,772
Let's not end this on a bad note.

327
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,709
You're a wonderful guy,

328
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:35,179
and who knows what
would have happened

329
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:37,381
if we had met before.

330
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:40,751
But it was never a question.

331
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,287
There was in my mind.

332
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,392
I'm sorry.

333
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,266
It's the end of the world.

334
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:03,374
If it really is the end of the
world, how funny, you know?

335
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:07,745
For once, it really would
be when it feels that way.

336
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:11,048
How romantic.

337
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:20,124
Anyway, turn on the TV.

338
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:23,427
It has something to do
with the war.

339
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,496
Meet me back at the house

340
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:29,967
and please change your outgoing
message, though, baby.

341
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,604
- Come on, come on. Let's go.
- Seriously.

342
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,873
I'm starting to tighten
up a little bit.

343
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,344
Let's go.

344
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,647
What?

345
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,816
She told me to turn on the TV.

346
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,252
- She wants me
to meet her at home. - Now?

347
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,189
Yeah.

348
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,360
- So you're...?
- Sorry, man.

349
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:58,896
You know what, man?
You are so fuckin' whipped.

350
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:03,333
Hey, I canceled a lot of shit for
this so we can just hang out.

351
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,436
Yeah? Like what?

352
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:06,870
Coffee at Saga?

353
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,006
Tarot card reading?

354
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,308
- Yeah.
- I'll see you on Thursday.

355
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,478
- You gotta be kiddin' me.
- I'll see you Thursday, man.

356
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,580
Yeah, fuck you, motherfucker.

357
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:19,116
- Thursday.
- If you're lucky.

358
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:28,158
God damn it.

359
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,201
Hey.

360
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,805
I finished the song.

361
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,479
I have an idea.

362
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,387
Why don't we take a nap, just
forget about everything?

363
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:06,263
Listen to this.

364
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,400
"The souls of all my dears

365
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,369
have flown to the stars.

366
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:16,240
Thank God there's no one
left for me to lose."

367
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,243
Hm.

368
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,690
You know what your
grandmother said to me?

369
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,225
Mm.

370
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,596
She said...

371
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,767
that "the only important language

372
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,936
spoken in the world

373
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,872
is spoken between

374
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:52,676
a man and a woman.

375
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,212
In bed."

376
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,459
I don't know. Maybe you
want to watch the news?

377
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,597
- Nuh-uh.
- Or write some more poetry?

378
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,066
No.

379
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:18,936
You know what? We should probably
get up and do the dishes.

380
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,938
No, I don't think so.

381
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,540
And so, finally...

382
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,275
eight years later or whatever...

383
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,244
at some New Year's Eve party,

384
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:03,447
Grandpa finally got up the
courage and he kissed her.

385
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,051
At least, that's how my
mom used to tell it.

386
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,398
They're gonna love you. Seriously.

387
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,433
Don't worry about it.

388
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:27,471
I'm not worried, baby.

389
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:46,890
- Hello!
- Hi!

390
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,558
- Hello!
- Hi!

391
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,762
I'm so glad to meet you.

392
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:53,630
I'm so happy to meet you, too.

393
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,766
Yes! Goodness! Ooh!

394
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:59,937
Someone did very well.
This is a beautiful ring.

395
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,972
- That's right.
- He did very great.

396
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,640
How are you, sweetheart?

397
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:08,078
Men are so much like
kids, it's silly.

398
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,517
I mean, there's the guitar
and there's the garden

399
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,053
and there's basketball
and football...

400
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:21,091
it's a wonder they have any time
at all to devote themselves

401
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,528
to other responsibilities
for family.

402
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,563
But they do. They do.

403
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,865
- Yeah.
- Bless 'em.

404
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,500
You know.

405
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,936
I'm gonna have to
sit down, I think.

406
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,938
- I just got a little pooped.
- Yeah, sure.

407
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,208
What you've gotta watch, of course,
is when you breed something

408
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,444
more and more specialized,

409
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,013
it can only survive
under very narrow

410
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:45,349
and specific conditions.

411
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,518
Here.

412
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,154
Thank you.

413
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,824
- Got something for you.
- No, Grandpa, I'm fine.

414
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,025
- No, no, no.
- I'm fine.

415
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,793
No, no, you can't refuse me.

416
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,229
You just can't. I'm not gonna
take no for an answer,

417
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,432
- so you might as well just stop.
- Okay.

418
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,835
And I wanna tell you something...

419
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:07,037
man to man, okay?

420
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,411
No matter how much
a woman may tell you

421
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,279
that she's happy to support you,

422
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:19,249
that she's not interested
in material things,

423
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,184
she wants you to be free...

424
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:24,054
sooner or later, they all
want the good things in life.

425
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:27,124
- I know, I know. But Anna isn't like that.
- Well, I'm sure she's not.

426
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,793
I'm not telling you
that she's shallow.

427
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:33,530
Probably is the most natural,
basic instinct in a woman...

428
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:37,901
actually, any human being...
make a home,

429
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:40,237
make a nest.

430
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,741
You know, I'm playing
a show at this thing.

431
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,376
It's called "South by Southwest."

432
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:49,413
And you know there's a lot of...

433
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:51,848
record company people,
and managers go.

434
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,418
That's wonderful.

435
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:59,856
- I can make a living playing music.
- I'm sure you can.

436
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,225
And I'm sure you'll figure it out.

437
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,895
Don't let anybody
pressure you, huh?

438
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:06,696
Just take your time.

439
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,566
If there's anything ever
I can do to help you,

440
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,568
you know I'm here.

441
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,873
So funny... I was just
thinking this morning

442
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,844
that, God, I have turned
into such a typical "girl."

443
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:24,815
I never thought
it would happen to me,

444
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:26,917
but I... oh, God...

445
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,352
I am completely obsessed with him.

446
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,388
Beyond obsessed with him.

447
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,091
I mean, even when
I'm angry or jealous

448
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:37,294
or, I don't know...
maybe that's the same thing...

449
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:41,131
but he leaves for an hour
and I can't stand it.

450
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:44,067
I don't know
what to do with myself.

451
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,336
I feel kind of crazy and...

452
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,473
that can't be healthy.

453
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:54,911
Well, I'm not sure it's healthy,
but it is the way it is.

454
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,980
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

455
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:59,249
And I'll tell you something else.

456
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,252
You'd be someplace at a party

457
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,688
or a friend's house or something...

458
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:09,259
and he'll be over there
talking to somebody.

459
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,195
And you see his face.

460
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,598
And you think,

461
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,802
"He and I are going to make
some beautiful babies."

462
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,107
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

463
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,279
You know what? I don't
think I can take this.

464
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,648
No, no. I told you I'm not
taking no for an answer.

465
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,683
- No, Grandpa, I can't.
- Oh, Erik, come on. I got it, you need it.

466
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:37,187
- What's the difference?
- I always appreciate...

467
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,756
I am not taking it back.
That's final.

468
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,264
- I'm sorry.
- Idiot.

469
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:50,901
You're too good for my dirty money?

470
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:53,403
You think there wouldn't be such a
thing as war if it wasn't for me?

471
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:56,139
I got news for you, kid. There
are worse sinners on this earth

472
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,041
- than your grandfather.
- No, no, no. I don't...

473
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:00,143
Wait till you have a child!

474
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,312
Wait till you have a sick child!

475
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,781
Then you'll lecture me.

476
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:11,755
And if you have any trouble
at all remembering

477
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:13,356
or if you aren't sure
of your answer,

478
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,991
just say, "I don't remember,"

479
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,826
or, "I don't have
any specific recollection."

480
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,329
Now, that last one actually
covers quite a lot.

481
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,632
If, for instance, you "sort of"
think you might remember something,

482
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:25,735
but it's possible that you
aren't remembering it clearly,

483
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,472
it's never perjury to say, "I don't
have any specific recollection."

484
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:33,710
They were developing a pathogen.

485
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,579
I know, Mr. Sachs.

486
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:38,215
But the prosecution won't be
asking about that tonight.

487
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,617
It wasn't even my division.

488
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:45,689
I offered advice to my clients
on pharmaceutical lines.

489
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,557
Okay.

490
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,097
We have about 15 minutes
until opening statements.

491
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,866
They just offered me so much money.

492
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,803
So much. Millions.

493
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:04,007
Okay. Mr. Sachs, look at me.

494
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:11,381
This trial is not about
how certain governments

495
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,918
got a hold of certain weapons
or formulas for weapons

496
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,420
over 30 years ago.

497
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,990
This trial deals with
the very narrow issue

498
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:22,492
of whether or not
you violated your contract

499
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,861
with Sichel Systems
by revealing trade secrets,

500
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:27,631
and you didn't do that.

501
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,833
You didn't break the
terms of your contract.

502
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:32,502
You're innocent.

503
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,738
Have you had a child?

504
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:41,544
- No.
- You can't watch them die.

505
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,181
She lived another 15 years

506
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,917
and she gave us our grandson, Erik.

507
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,022
But the prosecution doesn't
need to know that, do they?

508
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:54,624
I took it.

509
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,560
I took the money.

510
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:01,364
I knew it was wrong, but I took it.

511
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:07,037
My wife is living in denial,
but I know it's my fault.

512
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:10,674
I deserve to be punished.

513
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,417
We really need to leave, Mr. Sachs.

514
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,096
Oh, my God.

515
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,532
Oh... it's too far.

516
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:37,567
We'll get there, we'll get there.

517
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:41,771
Hold on. If we can find some
more canisters up there,

518
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:45,408
it's gonna get us
eight days of air,

519
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,877
and the poison will be gone.

520
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:57,087
To think I was so scared
about having that operation.

521
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:59,556
And Dr. Henderson died...

522
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,124
Esther, if you're
going to go through

523
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,959
all the ironies of the situation,

524
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,228
we're going to be talking another
20 years. You know that?

525
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,331
I won't say a word. I don't
ever want to say anything.

526
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,767
What? What did you say?

527
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,470
Excuse me?

528
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:15,739
You don't want to say anything?

529
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:19,509
Huh? You don't wanna
say anything...

530
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,579
about my pants?

531
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:26,416
Something about my pants?

532
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:29,419
They're too high.

533
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,956
Okay, here we go.

534
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,325
Have you been looking for a job?

535
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,826
Yeah, I've been looking for a job.

536
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:39,829
I print out another
175,000 resumes,

537
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:43,266
I change my profile on
another million job sites.

538
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,769
- I mean, the thing is...
- I even call Human Resources.

539
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:48,004
I swear to God, I feel like
"Willy Loman." I said...

540
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:53,576
"If anything comes
up, do me a favor.

541
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,146
Keep my number. Give me a call."

542
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,382
I mean, you were
getting plenty of work

543
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,217
when you were putting
her through law school.

544
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,052
Yeah. People used to hire writers.

545
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,555
You can get any job you want.

546
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,424
Yeah. One more job.

547
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:09,759
Pay some bills.

548
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,961
Buy some stuff, get another job,

549
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,830
pay some more bills,
buy some more stuff...

550
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:16,266
Yeah, but it's that or what?

551
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:19,102
Play basketball
with your buddies all day

552
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,438
and let Mia buy your shirts?

553
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,009
You know what's interesting
to me, is that why...

554
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,111
instead of printing
a bunch of resumes,

555
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,579
why we all don't just stop

556
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:33,550
in the middle of
the street and say...

557
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:35,552
"What the hell is going on here?

558
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:37,120
What is this all about?"

559
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:40,657
I mean, why am I here on
this earth, you know?

560
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,725
- Oh, Len...
- No, I mean it. I mean it.

561
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:46,129
Why does the universe
expand for eternity?

562
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,263
Wh-why...

563
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,865
how much longer am I gonna live?

564
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,401
Why am I the only animal
that knows it's gonna die?

565
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:53,503
We all asked ourselves
those questions

566
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,605
when we were, like, eight.

567
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,373
Yeah, but why did we
stop asking, you know?

568
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,442
'Cause I never got any answers.

569
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:05,048
Is this about the war?

570
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:12,155
This is about what I'm supposed
to be doing with my life.

571
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,994
I just don't know what I'm
supposed to tell Dad.

572
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:20,463
Oh, God, Sarah. Tell him I'm happy.

573
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,465
I mean, you tell me...
X-ray vision...

574
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,267
am I horribly depressed?

575
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:32,575
You know what I just
realized the other day?

576
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,645
We're at some party at Mia's office

577
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,581
and we'd just gotten
in some stupid fight

578
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,618
and we're outside
in the parking lot.

579
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,953
And I just realized that...

580
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,091
she's my wife.

581
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,795
And I love her.

582
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:56,699
I mean, I really love her.

583
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,435
She married me...

584
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,305
so I can't really be
that depressed, can I?

585
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,974
God.

586
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,644
I hope I meet someone
like you someday.

587
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:10,046
- Except with a job.
- Except with a job.

588
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:23,660
Come on.

589
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,302
Come on!

590
00:39:40,477 --> 00:39:42,912
Fuck.

591
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,957
Shit.

592
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:34,030
Mia? Sarah, what the
fuck is going on?

593
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:36,966
Listen... they're not telling
the whole story on the news.

594
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:39,402
Well, I haven't seen the news.
What's going on?

595
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:41,471
Just ignore what
everybody's saying.

596
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:43,139
You have to get back to the house.

597
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,475
Get out your dehumidifiers
and ionizers...

598
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:49,112
anything you have that filters air...
and seal yourself into the basement.

599
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:52,749
What... what is it?
Is this the war?

600
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:56,085
Just listen. Remember how we put
Mom's oxygen tanks up in the attic?

601
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:58,421
Yeah. I got rid of those
months ago, Sarah.

602
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:00,657
Damn.

603
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,426
Well, just stay down there
as long as you can.

604
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:05,128
I'm starting to freak
out here, Sarah.

605
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,497
What's going on?
How do you know all this?

606
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:10,867
Because I... I met someone
who knows about this,

607
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:13,770
- and I...
- Hey, Sarah?

608
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:16,205
Sarah, listen to me, okay?

609
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:20,076
What the fuck? Hold on a second.

610
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,845
I gotta give you a call back,
okay? I'm gonna call you back.

611
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,815
Stay safe.

612
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:34,023
Attention, please.

613
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,626
There has been an emergency
reported in the building.

614
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:38,761
Leave the building immediately

615
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:41,230
using marked stairways and exits.

616
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,099
Do not use elevators.

617
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,971
Hey, buddy.

618
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:52,008
Do you know where your
mommy and daddy are?

619
00:41:53,343 --> 00:41:55,111
You okay?

620
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,847
Using marked stairways and exits.

621
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,316
Do not use elevators.

622
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,288
Attention, please.
Attention, please.

623
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,691
There has been an emergency
reported in the building.

624
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:12,295
Leave the building immediately
using marked stairways...

625
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,697
It hurts.

626
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,600
What hurts?

627
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:19,102
My tummy.

628
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:22,739
Where does it hurt? Hmm?

629
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:24,073
It...

630
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,175
Okay, okay, buddy. Okay.

631
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:28,277
Uh...

632
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,113
we're gonna...

633
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:32,515
What the fuck are you doing?

634
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:35,284
- Hey...
- Get the fuck away from my boy!

635
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:38,488
Hey, man, it's okay.
Your kid is not doing...

636
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,289
hey, whoa!

637
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,692
Hey, hey... hey, listen!

638
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:44,927
Jesus Christ! Hey, listen, man!

639
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,063
- Listen!
- Fuck you...

640
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,098
- Daddy!
- Damn it! Listen!

641
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,035
Listen!

642
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,304
Jesus Christ, man! Stop!

643
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,974
Listen to me.

644
00:42:57,976 --> 00:43:00,176
Take care of your son!

645
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,908
Hey, do you have any Goldfish?

646
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,576
- Um...
- Yes, Goldfish.

647
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:36,379
Maybe up there.

648
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:39,015
Thanks.

649
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:40,917
Uh...?

650
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,420
Wow.

651
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:46,722
Do you think that they

652
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,925
stuffed everything up
like that for the party?

653
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:52,161
No, I think that is just how
they keep their things.

654
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:54,163
- You know what's weird about that?
- What?

655
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:56,499
Oh, shh... Oreos.

656
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:58,434
- Look at this.
- Mmm.

657
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:00,436
- Mmm.
- Mmm, mmm.

658
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:04,607
Yummy, yummy.

659
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,177
What's...

660
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,313
- What's weird?
- Huh?

661
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,148
- What's weird about it?
- What's weird, what's weird.

662
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,884
- You said...
- It was...

663
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:19,222
I don't know. It's just weird...
ever since we got engaged,

664
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:21,657
there's suddenly like all these...

665
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,659
I don't know, these
waves that we...

666
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,494
No. I know exactly what you mean.

667
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:30,199
There's, like, a right way and a wrong way
of doing everything, and we're, like...

668
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:35,605
You know why? It's 'cause we're, like,
we are like, the Anna and Erik tribe.

669
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:38,941
You know? And I mean there's
something terribly wrong

670
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:41,978
about putting the... look, the
cat food next to the tea.

671
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,848
Yeah, but probably the
way we stack things

672
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:50,586
and put things together really neatly
seems completely insane and constricting.

673
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:54,690
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

674
00:44:54,692 --> 00:45:00,029
I mean it already feels so wrong to do
it any other way than the way we do it.

675
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:05,902
Right, but that is how
it begins, you know?

676
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:08,804
That is why countries
invade each other...

677
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,340
'cause of that.

678
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,513
"You don't put the tea
in the right place."

679
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:20,316
Yeah? Fuck you! Fuck you,
you're the bad guys.

680
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:22,084
You have no idea how to
do it, and we're better.

681
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,686
"You know what? The green
tea goes on the top shelf

682
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:26,355
next to the cocoa, fuckwad,
or I'm gonna kill you."

683
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:30,493
The beginning of civilization.

684
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,495
I'm sorry. I have got to move this.

685
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:36,899
- No, I mean, it so doesn't belong there.
- There is something immoral about it.

686
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:40,202
- We'd be hypocrites if we fail that.
- Future generations will thank us.

687
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,405
The products of this apartment
will cry out for liberation.

688
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:46,476
It will be a beacon of proper shelf
arrangement for the entire region.

689
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,416
Oh, my God. So good.

690
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:56,619
I can't find the Goldfish.

691
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,691
He was up there. God.

692
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:14,196
I hear you.

693
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,694
Hi.

694
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,799
Hi.

695
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,938
- Was I talking to myself?
- No.

696
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:42,678
I've been feeling so weird
these past few days.

697
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,249
You know...

698
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:50,252
I see stuff.

699
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:54,290
Out of the corner
of my eye sometimes.

700
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:01,463
I don't even tell my boyfriend...

701
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:05,201
my fiancé.

702
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:11,273
And these past few days, I...

703
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:14,210
I mean literally,

704
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:17,379
last night, for a second,

705
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:22,518
it was like there was
nobody left anywhere...

706
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:28,757
except animals.

707
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,295
Running down the middle
of the street.

708
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:38,767
God, and Erik was like,

709
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,403
"What?

710
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:44,707
What are you staring at?"

711
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,617
You didn't say?

712
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,125
They say schizophrenia starts

713
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:07,696
when you're, like,

714
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:10,966
19 to 25.

715
00:51:10,968 --> 00:51:12,501
You hear voices?

716
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:23,045
Well, I just heard a bunch of crows

717
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:26,415
screaming "War! War!"

718
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,384
Well, they aren't telling you

719
00:51:28,386 --> 00:51:31,086
to jump off any
high buildings, right?

720
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,622
No.

721
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:35,524
Good.

722
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:40,129
My name is Rick.

723
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:42,698
I'm Anna.

724
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:59,348
I've considered

725
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:02,951
the high building option.

726
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,892
But life is so absurdly
short, anyway.

727
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,831
Yeah, I've been thinking that.

728
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,836
Makes you only want to do
the important things.

729
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,973
But what are the important things?

730
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:42,758
I'm pregnant.

731
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:49,531
First time I've told anybody.

732
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:02,978
- Greyhound.
- You got it.

733
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,981
Vodka and grapefruit.

734
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,157
Here you go.

735
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:18,327
Thank you.

736
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:20,329
You don't know what a Greyhound is?

737
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:23,665
Hey, who got us this job?

738
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:28,303
So, anyway, all I'm saying
is marriage is just

739
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:31,607
all of these artificial
restrictions.

740
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:33,742
It's like going on
some radical diet

741
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:36,044
when you're not even fat.

742
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:40,149
All I'm saying is, yes,

743
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:42,618
agreed, congratulations

744
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,687
Anna is hot. She's incredibly hot.

745
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,290
And, granted, you're probably
not going to meet anybody

746
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:50,192
who's that hot and whatever cool

747
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:52,795
and interesting and wonderful.

748
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:55,164
I don't know
what you're talking about.

749
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:56,665
You're making a scene.

750
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,167
Well, what is he looking at, then?

751
00:53:58,169 --> 00:53:59,668
Right now he's looking at you.

752
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,870
Having dragged me across
the room and yelling at me

753
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:05,140
- in front of all my coworkers...
- I'm not yelling at you.

754
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:07,910
Can I get a vodka and tonic?

755
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,684
Brilliant, that's exactly right.

756
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,453
- Yeah.
- Fucking more alcohol

757
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:19,588
because that's really
going to help.

758
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,126
Thank you.

759
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:34,069
See? He probably
thought he was marrying

760
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:35,871
the most magical,
beautiful girl on earth.

761
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,475
It's up to you, man.
I'm just saying

762
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:40,476
you could be dealing
with that kind of shit

763
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:41,810
for the rest of your life.

764
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:44,279
Or I could spend the rest
of my life saying,

765
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,483
"I met the one true love of my life

766
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,952
when I was 22 years old
and I was too scared

767
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:53,822
- to ask her to marry me."
- If she is the one true love of your life.

768
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:57,259
I mean, there are
billions of people.

769
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:12,474
No, she's...

770
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:15,344
she's the one true love of my life.

771
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:18,046
Okay.

772
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:23,585
So you have the rest of your
life to ask her to marry you.

773
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:33,962
Fuck.

774
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,612
It happens every time.

775
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:55,918
I get dressed up to come to a thing
like this, and it's a fucking disaster.

776
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:09,264
Len,

777
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:14,202
none of these people matter to me.

778
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:27,349
None of these people mean
anything to me except you.

779
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:42,931
Let's get out of here.

780
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,644
Ah, fuck.

781
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:11,893
Oh, God I need water.

782
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:12,794
Water.

783
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:15,197
Done.

784
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:25,407
What's this?

785
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:27,643
I got it at the museum.

786
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:31,546
It's a trilobite.

787
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,448
It's probably like
300 million years old.

788
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:37,052
And now they just give them
away with a $50 membership.

789
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,890
There used to be billions of 'em.

790
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:45,060
They must have had a lot of sex.

791
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,064
They couldn't help themselves.

792
00:57:57,173 --> 00:58:00,375
They were in love.

793
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:02,411
Or it was just instinct.

794
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:07,282
Same thing, I guess.

795
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,198
I'd have babies with you.

796
00:58:25,868 --> 00:58:28,370
I mean, not right away, but...

797
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:37,079
we should, you know?

798
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:46,188
What?

799
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,324
I never said never.

800
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:53,729
I said, "Don't marry me if
you want to have children."

801
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:56,431
But you would?

802
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:01,903
I could.

803
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:09,111
Yeah, I would.

804
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:16,418
We should.

805
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:21,289
- Right?
- Right.

806
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,796
Think of how beautiful it would be.

807
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:30,932
"It"? She. She.

808
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:38,874
Okay. We will.

809
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:40,742
You promise?

810
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:43,345
Not right away.

811
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,948
But someday.

812
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:50,485
Promise.

813
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:27,189
Mia?!

814
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:39,434
There you go.

815
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:49,144
It's okay.

816
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,693
Come here.

817
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:06,061
So we need to...

818
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:07,864
I need you to get everything
out of the kitchen

819
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:10,665
that you can, okay? I need you to
just get everything that you can.

820
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:15,871
Okay? I'm going to go upstairs
and get some blankets. Okay?

821
01:01:15,873 --> 01:01:17,672
Gonna bring it down
to the basement.

822
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:21,309
Okay? Yeah?

823
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,347
Sure.

824
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,349
Okay.

825
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:33,221
The following message is transmitted at the
request of the United States government.

826
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:36,391
This is not a test. All
residents of the United States

827
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:38,727
are strongly encouraged
to establish...

828
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:40,295
Gonna need some more tape.

829
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:44,232
We've gotta seal all the windows up
here, we've gotta seal the door.

830
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,740
Does creme soda count as water?

831
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:53,408
What?

832
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:57,846
- Come on, sweetheart.
- I'll just get that, okay?

833
01:01:57,848 --> 01:02:00,015
Let's get everything downstairs.

834
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,920
It's all diet food.

835
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:07,155
It's all fucking...

836
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:12,327
low carb crap.

837
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:14,129
All of it.

838
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:17,832
It's okay, sweetheart.

839
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:20,535
Hey, look...

840
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:23,772
I have a chocolate bar
in my pocket, okay?

841
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:27,208
With almonds, okay?

842
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,744
Go back downstairs.

843
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,246
Okay?

844
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:34,516
Go back downstairs.

845
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,053
- Come on, sweetie.
- Okay, okay, okay.

846
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,701
I got it.

847
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,538
Do you need this tape?

848
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,606
- Nope.
- Okay.

849
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:03,478
Did you call Sarah?

850
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,613
Mm-hmm.

851
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:16,725
You okay down there, sweetheart?

852
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:34,676
Ooh.

853
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:44,819
Andy, it's...

854
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,721
it's time to stop.

855
01:03:46,723 --> 01:03:49,057
I thought you didn't
want to talk anymore.

856
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:56,364
I just don't want to sit here
watching you kill yourself.

857
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,403
We'll get there.

858
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:03,638
You see? If we can
just make it up there,

859
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,075
we're gonna find some more
canisters, I know it.

860
01:04:09,578 --> 01:04:13,681
Stop that, Esther.
Stop it, come on.

861
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,384
Take your hand...

862
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:18,820
Take your hand off the wheel.

863
01:04:23,859 --> 01:04:26,327
I'm sorry.

864
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,897
I'm sorry, but look.

865
01:04:28,899 --> 01:04:30,598
I've gotta...

866
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,201
we can't afford the energy it takes

867
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:35,737
to fight like this.

868
01:04:37,873 --> 01:04:40,308
I wish... I wish you would put

869
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:44,179
more energy into finding solutions.

870
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:47,282
There are no solutions, honey.

871
01:04:47,284 --> 01:04:52,253
The news broadcasts
have stopped, and...

872
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:55,490
everybody that we love is dead.

873
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:04,165
Listen to me.

874
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:12,173
Everyone I love is not dead.

875
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:16,044
The only person
on earth that I love

876
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:20,415
is still alive.

877
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,486
Oh, you're such a charmer.

878
01:05:24,488 --> 01:05:28,256
You could charm the
knickers off of any girl.

879
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:34,729
Well, there's no girls
left but my girl.

880
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:40,268
Okay.

881
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:45,173
Here we go.

882
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:02,824
I can't stand how much
I miss you when I'm gone.

883
01:06:02,826 --> 01:06:04,859
I know.

884
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,932
Oh... so, I got a new book

885
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:13,868
that I really want to read to you.

886
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:15,737
Okay.

887
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:18,072
Wait, I don't know
which one to read to you.

888
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:20,041
Wow, that song is really good.

889
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:23,478
Yeah, you know, I...
Let me just read you one.

890
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,982
What... you don't have to stop.

891
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,185
I know, I know.

892
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:33,388
I mean, I just, I just...

893
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:35,390
I just wanted to
show you something.

894
01:06:35,392 --> 01:06:37,358
In the park. I want your opinion

895
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,061
on something that they're
building across the river.

896
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:42,664
Uh, what, before we go home?

897
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:45,133
Yeah, yeah.

898
01:06:45,135 --> 01:06:50,205
It's just been bugging me.
I pass it every day on my run,

899
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:52,507
you know.

900
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,108
Right.

901
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,177
So do you want to look at it?

902
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,313
Uh, sure.

903
01:06:58,315 --> 01:07:01,216
You don't want to hear this?

904
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:05,420
No, no. Read it to
me, read it to me.

905
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:07,422
Ahem.

906
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:11,926
"At the red towers of
your native Sodom,

907
01:07:11,928 --> 01:07:14,696
the square where once you sang,

908
01:07:16,398 --> 01:07:20,602
the spinning shed, at the empty
windows set into the house,

909
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:24,239
where sons and daughters
blessed your marriage bed.

910
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:28,543
A single glance, a
sudden dart of pain

911
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:33,548
stitching her eyes
before she made a sound.

912
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:38,052
Her body flaked into
transparent salt.

913
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:41,222
Her swift legs rooted
to the ground."

914
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,324
Right?

915
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:48,329
That's... that's incredible.

916
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:51,799
- You're so distracted.
- No, I'm not. I liked it.

917
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,002
No, you have no idea
what I just read to you.

918
01:07:54,004 --> 01:07:56,137
Not no idea. Come on.

919
01:07:56,139 --> 01:07:59,474
Hey. "Dilute."

920
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:02,043
"Dilute. Dilute!"

921
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:06,748
Dilute. Okay.

922
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:11,386
Come on. Let's go see
your weird-ass building.

923
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:33,975
Okay. Uh...

924
01:08:33,977 --> 01:08:37,145
this looks right.

925
01:08:37,147 --> 01:08:39,847
See that...

926
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:43,751
that big red building with
the arches? It's that.

927
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:46,487
- Oh.
- Right next to it with the...

928
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:48,756
The water tower, just
right under that,

929
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:50,758
there's like this cluster
of red buildings.

930
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,461
That red garage-looking thing?

931
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:57,265
- Yeah.
- I can't really see it.

932
01:08:57,267 --> 01:08:59,467
- Is it next to the...
- Yeah.

933
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,803
What am I looking at?

934
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:07,575
Hey!

935
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:11,412
I have to give this to you now.

936
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:15,750
Oh, my God.

937
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,756
What does that mean?
What does that...

938
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:23,424
is that a "yes"?

939
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:28,796
You have to say yes
if you're gonna...

940
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,016
You still need to say "yes."

941
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,789
I love you.

942
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,827
I love you so much.

943
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:05,099
Say yes. You need to say yes.

944
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:10,238
Please.

945
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,473
Look at you.

946
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:18,446
You love me...

947
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,090
Well, what do you
think of our news?

948
01:10:29,092 --> 01:10:32,160
- What news?
- Our news.

949
01:10:32,162 --> 01:10:34,061
Erik and Anna.

950
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,631
Oh, that's fine.

951
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:39,333
Oh, honey. You don't
dislike Anna, do you?

952
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:42,270
I think she's wonderful
and I just love her.

953
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:44,272
I'm just so happy about this.

954
01:10:44,274 --> 01:10:47,909
I like her fine.

955
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,782
You know I offered him some
money and he wouldn't take it?

956
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:57,952
Oh, well, he's getting married.

957
01:10:57,954 --> 01:11:00,221
You know, he's going to
be the big macho man now.

958
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:03,891
Head of the family. He'll probably
never take money from us again.

959
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:07,595
Well, I bet if I made it in real estate
or cattle ranching, he'd take it.

960
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:10,064
What are you laughing at?

961
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:12,667
Nothing... well, yes, I am.

962
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:17,038
I'm thinking of you standing in
the middle of a herd of cows.

963
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,106
Very funny.

964
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,044
Honey, don't do that.

965
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:26,347
Oh! Oh, shit.

966
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:29,250
God damn it.

967
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:31,486
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.

968
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:34,088
Just leave it. I'll get it later.

969
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:40,995
Come on over here, my darling
man, and talk to me.

970
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:54,041
What's the matter?

971
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:57,078
Tell me what's really
troubling you.

972
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,316
I took their money.

973
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,853
They wouldn't have paid me so much if
they weren't gonna use my knowledge.

974
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:09,090
Oh, no. You weren't
working for them.

975
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:12,226
You were just working
at their laboratory.

976
01:12:12,228 --> 01:12:16,163
They wanted great scientists
to work at their laboratory.

977
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,132
It gives them prestige.

978
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:20,701
I knew they were
working on pathogens.

979
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:25,907
They were just picking my brain.
All I could think about was Liza.

980
01:12:28,343 --> 01:12:30,945
Listen.

981
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:33,748
That money...

982
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:37,018
gave Liza 15 more years of life.

983
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,955
It gave her Erik.

984
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,360
What if they use it, Esther?

985
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:50,665
What if they use it
and everybody dies?

986
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:53,634
Well, I think you're
going completely crazy.

987
01:12:53,636 --> 01:12:55,102
I really do, you know.

988
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:58,839
You are not to blame for
everything in this world,

989
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:02,109
no matter how smart you are.

990
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:04,712
And I'll tell you something else.

991
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,948
I'm taking a little
offense at this.

992
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:10,184
I didn't marry a murderer.

993
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:13,955
I married the kindest,

994
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:15,990
gentlest,

995
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:18,993
most loving man

996
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:21,696
in the world.

997
01:13:24,499 --> 01:13:30,371
I don't think you ever knew
just how much I love you.

998
01:13:41,249 --> 01:13:43,784
I swear, it...

999
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,821
- Esther?
- Ow...!

1000
01:13:46,823 --> 01:13:48,889
- What is it, honey?
- Ow!

1001
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:52,126
- Come on, Esther. Come on. Come.
- Oh. No.

1002
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:55,463
- Come on, come with me.
- I'm fine. I just got excited.

1003
01:13:55,465 --> 01:13:57,031
Come on, come on. Let me take you.

1004
01:13:57,033 --> 01:13:59,834
I'll take you upstairs.
Okay, come on.

1005
01:13:59,836 --> 01:14:01,702
One, two, three.

1006
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:04,372
- Here we go.
- Oh...!

1007
01:14:04,374 --> 01:14:07,241
Come on.

1008
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:11,846
Come on.

1009
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:19,987
I'm okay, really.

1010
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:25,326
Well, whatever it is,
seven or eight days.

1011
01:14:26,828 --> 01:14:28,629
When we're done with the water...

1012
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:31,999
and there's tangerine juice, too.

1013
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:38,172
When we're done with
everything, then we go up.

1014
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:41,108
Even though the radio
said eight days.

1015
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:45,012
Maybe we ought to make it seven. But
what the fuck do they know, you know?

1016
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:49,150
Air could be clear at six. Clear
enough, anyway, for me to go up

1017
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:52,053
and get supplies and
come back down here.

1018
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,900
- What?
- The last thing they said was...

1019
01:15:05,902 --> 01:15:09,437
"200 million dead in Europe."

1020
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:15,810
So that's not everybody.

1021
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:18,713
Nothing's gonna be left, Len.

1022
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,584
We don't know that until we see.

1023
01:15:23,586 --> 01:15:27,121
Len, nothing's left.

1024
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:33,060
The radio stopped.

1025
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:38,199
There's no more planes
or helicopters.

1026
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:42,336
When's the last time you heard
anything other than birds?

1027
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,847
We'll stay down here
three more days.

1028
01:15:52,849 --> 01:15:55,149
And then...

1029
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:57,118
- We'll drive to the marina.
- No.

1030
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,121
We'll get a boat.

1031
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,325
We'll go out on the lake.

1032
01:16:04,327 --> 01:16:07,328
And we'll keep going
until we find someone.

1033
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,502
- I don't...
- What?

1034
01:16:14,504 --> 01:16:16,670
I don't wanna...

1035
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:20,241
wade through a bunch of corpses

1036
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:22,977
to go steal a boat

1037
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:26,147
to go look at more corpses
lying on a bunch of docks.

1038
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:34,021
Even...

1039
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:37,725
even if we did make it, Len,

1040
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:40,795
what are we supposed to do?

1041
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:45,499
Do you really want
to play "Adam and Eve"?

1042
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:48,636
Build it all back up so it all
just gets destroyed again?

1043
01:16:48,638 --> 01:16:50,805
Maybe people will learn.

1044
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:56,177
It's like that guy who hit you for
trying to take care of his kid.

1045
01:16:56,179 --> 01:16:59,046
It's like that guy
I defended... great guy,

1046
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:02,883
good father, always showing me
pictures of his grandson...

1047
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:06,487
who helped invent the shit
that killed everyone.

1048
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:12,593
People aren't going to learn.

1049
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:14,762
It's something in us.

1050
01:17:14,764 --> 01:17:17,598
It's something in the
way that we're made.

1051
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:23,470
Then at least...

1052
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,907
we'll have more time.

1053
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:29,476
At least we'll go out
on the water together.

1054
01:17:34,015 --> 01:17:37,184
We'll find a boat with
a nice, big cabin.

1055
01:17:42,123 --> 01:17:44,325
Come on.

1056
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:54,301
Len?

1057
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,971
That guy, Jay, from the law firm?

1058
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,417
He fell in love with me.

1059
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:18,559
I never did anything.

1060
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:21,061
I never let him touch me.

1061
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:25,366
But I...

1062
01:18:26,801 --> 01:18:29,370
you know, I...

1063
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:36,110
I made him think, I guess...

1064
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:41,682
that he had a shot at it.

1065
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:45,619
- Why?
- It was just a way to...

1066
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:48,923
Just a way to pass the time?

1067
01:18:48,925 --> 01:18:52,092
To feel better
about myself, I guess.

1068
01:19:02,203 --> 01:19:05,739
Why do you need to feel
better about yourself?

1069
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,609
It wasn't about you.

1070
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:29,263
It was just my curse.

1071
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,905
Len.

1072
01:19:37,907 --> 01:19:43,143
Why are they gonna stay down
here like caged animals?

1073
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:53,120
Or we're gonna go
upstairs tomorrow...

1074
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:02,029
and lie down on the grass.

1075
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:06,000
Breathe in...

1076
01:20:07,902 --> 01:20:10,170
and die...

1077
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:12,673
when and where we choose.

1078
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:20,547
We'll eat the chocolate bar
before we do it, okay?

1079
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:25,686
Okay?

1080
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:52,746
- Oh, my God.
- What? What?

1081
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:56,550
Did you buy this weird soap?

1082
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:59,386
What?

1083
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:02,122
I seriously think
I've found my new religion.

1084
01:21:05,927 --> 01:21:07,394
Oh, yeah, that stuff.

1085
01:21:07,396 --> 01:21:09,696
Wait, have you read this?

1086
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,899
No. I mean, the
writing's so tiny...

1087
01:21:11,901 --> 01:21:14,635
Wait a minute. Listen to this.

1088
01:21:14,637 --> 01:21:16,970
"Einstein, 1939.

1089
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:21,909
After Nazis and Commies united,
proposes 'space bombs'

1090
01:21:21,911 --> 01:21:28,048
that destroys all unless we
finally teach the moral ABCs

1091
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:31,618
the real Rabbi Hillel taught Jesus

1092
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:36,323
to unite all in,
all one, God faith."

1093
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:05,085
Did you find a pay phone?

1094
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:13,060
I got some noodles.

1095
01:22:13,062 --> 01:22:15,062
Just gotta add water.

1096
01:22:15,064 --> 01:22:17,431
And some drinks.

1097
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:20,934
And there's these things...

1098
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,103
energy bars.

1099
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:27,174
And napkins.

1100
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:33,947
I couldn't find a pay phone. I don't
think they make them anymore.

1101
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:37,651
What is this doing on a soap bottle?
And where did you get this?

1102
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:39,353
I mean, it was at
the health food store.

1103
01:22:39,355 --> 01:22:41,922
- It was cheap.
- "We're all one or none.

1104
01:22:41,924 --> 01:22:46,026
There is no god but God.
Teach 'Love thy enemy.'

1105
01:22:46,028 --> 01:22:49,263
One Israel-Moses-
Buddha-Jesus-Mohammed.

1106
01:22:49,265 --> 01:22:51,632
- One! All one!"
- All one!

1107
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:54,334
"Dilute! Dilute! Okay!"

1108
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:56,470
How about the switchboard?

1109
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:59,306
The hospital switchboard.

1110
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:04,077
Or all of these houses and
apartments around here.

1111
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,880
They've all got to have phones.

1112
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:11,818
Esther...

1113
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,755
he's gone.

1114
01:23:14,757 --> 01:23:18,325
Erik's gone.

1115
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:19,660
Oh, look at this. Read this.

1116
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:21,261
"For on God's spaceship, Earth"...

1117
01:23:21,263 --> 01:23:23,830
"With bomb and gun,

1118
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,333
we're all one or none.

1119
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:29,603
All one, all one, all one!

1120
01:23:29,605 --> 01:23:33,073
Exceptions eternally?
Absolutely none!"

1121
01:23:33,075 --> 01:23:36,076
"Absolutely none."

1122
01:23:36,078 --> 01:23:37,878
Oh, my God.

1123
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,214
Why is the most inspiring
thing that I've ever read

1124
01:23:40,216 --> 01:23:43,016
sitting on a soap bottle?

1125
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:44,518
"Dilute."

1126
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,753
"Dilute! Dilute!"

1127
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:48,989
"Dilute! Okay."

1128
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:05,505
- You don't know that.
- It's just the way it is.

1129
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:09,543
Because he could be
with any of his friends.

1130
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,712
That's just it, honey.

1131
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:14,982
You don't know it
for sure. You don't...

1132
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:21,054
No! No!

1133
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:25,292
Oh, oop!

1134
01:24:25,294 --> 01:24:27,396
No...

1135
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:42,776
Oh, God, no.

1136
01:24:42,778 --> 01:24:44,645
Shh...

1137
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:40,000
Okay, people. We're closing
down shop in two minutes.

1138
01:25:40,002 --> 01:25:43,036
You've got two minutes to get
your purchases up to the counter.

1139
01:25:43,038 --> 01:25:45,605
Okay?

1140
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:48,809
That's it, man.
We gotta go. Come on.

1141
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:51,478
250. Let's go.

1142
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,347
- Come on.
- Yeah.

1143
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:55,515
Um... fuck.

1144
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:57,117
- Hey. We're done, man.
- Let's go.

1145
01:25:57,119 --> 01:25:59,920
I-I gave all my money to...
here, just run this.

1146
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:01,888
Yeah, okay, buddy.
That's it. We're outta here.

1147
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:04,791
You're closing up shop.
Just... just...

1148
01:26:04,793 --> 01:26:06,927
you're not selling any more
of these anyway, right?

1149
01:26:06,929 --> 01:26:08,695
Don't be stupid, man. We ain't
giving them away, either.

1150
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:12,566
I understand that. Just take this.
Here. That's all I got. It's all I got.

1151
01:26:12,568 --> 01:26:16,203
Get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out now.

1152
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:25,078
- Hey.
- Hey! Put down the kit!

1153
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,981
It's the end of the world, okay? Just
let me walk out of here with a chance.

1154
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:29,950
Put down the kit.

1155
01:26:29,952 --> 01:26:34,821
What? The last thing you wanna
do on earth is shoot me?

1156
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:38,024
This is how this shit
started, anyway.

1157
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,960
Right? That's how it
started in the first...

1158
01:26:50,671 --> 01:26:53,807
- You ready?
- I'm fine.

1159
01:26:53,809 --> 01:26:57,144
Good. If you're fine,
the tests are gonna show it.

1160
01:26:57,146 --> 01:26:59,846
Anyway...

1161
01:26:59,848 --> 01:27:03,283
we haven't seen Dr.
Henderson for a long time.

1162
01:27:03,285 --> 01:27:05,218
- Come here.
- That's right.

1163
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,987
And here I was,
trying to cheer you up.

1164
01:27:06,989 --> 01:27:09,122
Oh, yeah.

1165
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:13,760
You remember when
we lived in Washington,

1166
01:27:13,762 --> 01:27:15,996
the Georgetown apartment?

1167
01:27:15,998 --> 01:27:17,831
Yes, I do.

1168
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,666
We both got the flu
at the same time.

1169
01:27:19,668 --> 01:27:23,870
Yeah. And I took care of you first.

1170
01:27:23,872 --> 01:27:25,772
I ran out in the freezing cold,

1171
01:27:25,774 --> 01:27:28,341
went and got you a nice,
big bowl of hot soup.

1172
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:30,944
- It was so cold.
- Yeah.

1173
01:27:30,946 --> 01:27:35,215
And I wrapped you up all
nice and cozy in a blanket.

1174
01:27:35,217 --> 01:27:36,883
Remember?

1175
01:27:36,885 --> 01:27:40,053
Then I turned the thermostat
up as high as it would go.

1176
01:27:40,055 --> 01:27:43,089
Then it was my turn to baby you.

1177
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,459
Tucked you in real tight,

1178
01:27:45,461 --> 01:27:50,797
And I made you some of those
awful poached eggs you like.

1179
01:27:50,799 --> 01:27:52,766
Mm-hmm.

1180
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:59,005
It's been a good life.

1181
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:01,475
Yeah, I think so.

1182
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:05,812
A good life.

1183
01:28:12,187 --> 01:28:14,955
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

1184
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:17,357
What?

1185
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:19,793
The best thing in the world.

1186
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:19,286
I have something to tell you.

1187
01:29:21,355 --> 01:29:24,558
What...?

1188
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,761
The best thing in the world.

1189
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:36,036
We're going to have a baby.

1190
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,228
We don't have to do this.

1191
01:30:06,133 --> 01:30:11,171
Whatever we said last night,
we don't have to do it.

1192
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:17,243
Not today, anyway.

1193
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:24,184
Mmm, mmm.

1194
01:30:24,186 --> 01:30:26,252
I regret every fucking
diet I ever went on.

1195
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:33,960
Mmm.

1196
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:03,289
Come on.

1197
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:08,294
Let's get out of here.

1198
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:22,876
Ahem.

1199
01:31:27,182 --> 01:31:31,751
If you have to, if that's
what you have to do...

1200
01:31:31,753 --> 01:31:34,788
go, but I won't.

1201
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:39,359
I...

1202
01:31:39,361 --> 01:31:43,997
I don't think we're gonna run out of food.
I don't think we're gonna run out of water.

1203
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:46,399
I think that if we just stay down
here another couple of days...

1204
01:31:46,401 --> 01:31:48,601
- No.
- If we go up then, we're gonna be fine.

1205
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:50,270
- Mm-mm.
- Okay?

1206
01:31:50,272 --> 01:31:52,672
- No.
- Yeah.

1207
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:55,008
Yes!

1208
01:32:01,982 --> 01:32:04,084
Yes.

1209
01:32:10,759 --> 01:32:14,027
Mia! Don't leave me!

1210
01:32:17,531 --> 01:32:20,633
Don't leave me. Stay with me.

1211
01:32:20,635 --> 01:32:23,570
I love you, baby,
I love you. I need you.

1212
01:32:23,572 --> 01:32:26,306
I need you, I need you.
I need you, I need you... stay!

1213
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:33,313
Please stay!

1214
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:39,018
Please, I need you. Please?

1214
01:32:40,305 --> 01:33:40,881
