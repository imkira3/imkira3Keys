2
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:54,303
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

3
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:59,766
It's been a year
since my last confession.

4
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:07,058
I never told anyone this. Not my
mom, the police, not my friends.

5
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:14,403
Except for the ones who were there,
and they're not around anymore.

6
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:20,494
- You see, I...
- Yes?

7
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,460
I killed a man.

8
00:02:28,837 --> 00:02:31,624
But it was an accident.

9
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:36,843
A terrible accident, and I've tried
to get past it, but I can't.

10
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:43,213
- Go on.
- I have these... dreams.

11
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,637
Really horrible dreams.

12
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:51,556
This man is always there with me.

13
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:58,816
He was a killer. He murdered Barry
and Helen, but I got away with it.

14
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,874
I guess I just need to deal with it,
you know?

15
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:12,794
Face the fear and the guilt.

16
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,038
Finally say his name.

17
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:20,836
Ben Willis.

18
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:27,256
- Ben Willis.
- I know.

19
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:35,359
You know? How could you..?

20
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,684
I know what you did last summer.

21
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:51,072
Nice to see you find political
science so stimulating, Miss James.

22
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:59,255
Sorry.

23
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,719
- Julie, wait. Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

24
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:17,597
- You sure? You don't seem fine.
- I had another dream, Will.

25
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:24,144
- The one in the shower?
- In a church. God, it was so real.

26
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:27,607
I thought the dreams were over.

27
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:30,654
- It'll get better.
- It can't get worse.

28
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:36,450
I've freaked out in class before.
I can't study, I can't sleep.

29
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,163
I'm this close to failing school.

30
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:41,744
Happy Fourth of July!

31
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:49,585
- It was one year ago.
- It's the anniversary.

32
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:54,258
- You've just got to take it easy.
- I'm really trying.

33
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:56,971
Sometimes I wonder why I came here.

34
00:04:57,144 --> 00:05:01,189
- To get out of Southport?
- Right. Now I remember.

35
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:04,476
Are you going away for the Fourth?

36
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:09,360
I'll be studying for the finals.
The joys of summer school.

37
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:14,276
Are you okay? Sure?
You're definitely okay?

38
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:17,656
Yes, I'm definitely okay.

39
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:21,414
Thanks for the talk, Will.
You're good to me.

40
00:05:21,585 --> 00:05:24,620
- I am?
- Yeah.

41
00:05:24,837 --> 00:05:29,334
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay. Bye.

42
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:40,969
- Julie.
- Ray? God, what are you doing here?

43
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:44,430
I got in early. Who was that guy?

44
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:49,149
That's Will. He's a friend.
You'd like him. We're just friends.

45
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,230
All guys trying to pick up a girl
try the "good friend" thing first.

46
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:57,859
Ready to go? You know the drill.

47
00:05:58,036 --> 00:06:03,456
The Croaker Queen Pageant.
Small-town fun, but nice.

48
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:06,376
- Ray, I can't.
- Can't what?

49
00:06:09,296 --> 00:06:15,500
I feel like I haven't healed enough
to go back. So please understand.

50
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:18,505
- I understand.
- It's not you.

51
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:23,846
It's all me. In my head.
I want to go back.

52
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,101
I want to be fine, to be with you.
I want it all to be like it was.

53
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:34,564
It just isn't. Why don't you stay up
here? Fireworks over the river...

54
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:40,442
I have to work, Julie. My boat's in
Southport, remember? But it's cool.

55
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:47,236
You need your space from Croakerland
and probably from me too.

56
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:52,960
- Ray...
- Just forget it.

57
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,720
I'm scared, that's all.

58
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,646
Shit.

59
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:29,200
What the hell are you doing
in my closet?

60
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:33,587
I thought you left.
I just wanted to borrow your skirt.

61
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:38,547
- Jesus, that was heart attack time!
- Can I have the knife now?

62
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:43,546
- Come out with me tonight.
- I just tried to stab you.

63
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:48,848
- I hardly feel like dancing.
- What's the matter?

64
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,432
- I think I hurt Ray's feelings.
- Listen to me.

65
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:57,065
Ray is a great guy.
Nothing against old Ray, -

66
00:10:57,236 --> 00:11:00,770
- but he's so... Ray.

67
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:05,782
He lives in Southport.
Will lives right down the street.

68
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:09,652
- But there's nothing between us.
- Yet. Nothing yet.

69
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:16,035
I'm working at the club. And you,
Dancing Queen, are coming with me.

70
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:21,206
- No, I'm not...
- Yes, you are. What did I say?

71
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:35,640
You know what I want to do to you,
right?

72
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:39,983
- No.
- Is there a place we can be alone?

73
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:43,686
- I don't think so. It's crowded.
- Come on.

74
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:49,818
- I just want to talk for a minute.
- If it only takes a minute, no way.

75
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:54,455
I'll talk real, real slow.

76
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:59,830
Not at work. Do me a favour.
Ask Julie to dance.

77
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:08,173
You know, Jules, you're the most
beautiful woman in the bar tonight.

78
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:11,880
Ty, you're an unstoppable
force of nature.

79
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:17,680
You better recognise.
That's how my species survives.

80
00:12:17,895 --> 00:12:22,771
- So, what's up? Wanna dance?
- Say yes. No means yes.

81
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:27,687
Ty, have you seen my people dance?
We do the mouth thing. Snap fingers.

82
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:32,075
You can always
just stand there and watch me.

83
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:35,611
I have an idea.
Why don't we all go dance?

84
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:37,495
Let's go.

85
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh, what do you know?
Will Benson, looking fine.

86
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:56,384
- Did you tell him I'd be here?
- I told him you wouldn't be here.

87
00:12:56,557 --> 00:13:02,227
- And he came anyway. What's up?
- This wasn't my idea.

88
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:05,266
- This wasn't...
- You'll be fine. Do your thing.

89
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:10,398
- Be good, Julie.
- You want to get a drink?

90
00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:40,231
Hey... Did you see something
back there?

91
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:47,321
I'm really sorry, but I've got
to go home right now. I'm sorry.

92
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:30,369
Morning.

93
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:35,456
- I love when they do that.
- That could break the machine.

94
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:40,537
- That's Ty.
- My number's unlisted.

95
00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:45,790
Relax. We've been dating for three
months and he is not a stalker.

96
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:52,259
This is Mark in the Morning
from Magic 96. 7 radio station.

97
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:58,552
It's Mark in the Morning! Put on
the speakerphone. Oh, my God. Hi.

98
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:05,017
- Hi, Mark. I'm Karla Wilson.
- Well, what are you doing at home?

99
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:10,983
- I'm actually in school...
- Want to win our magic getaway?

100
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:17,075
I hope you remember your geography.
What is the capitaI of BraziI?

101
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:24,086
- Okay. The capital of Brazil...
- One question, one great getaway.

102
00:16:24,254 --> 00:16:29,710
Karla, we need an answer.
No looking it up. Five seconds.

103
00:16:29,884 --> 00:16:36,088
- Four, three, two...
- Rio de Janeiro!

104
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:39,557
- Oh, no. Did you say Rio?
- No.

105
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:45,103
- Yes..? Yes!
- You won the 96. 7 quickie getaway!

106
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:49,360
A trip for four to Tower Bay Island
in the fabulous Bahamas!

107
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:52,944
- I can't hear.
- We'll call back with the details.

108
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:55,652
- What's your favourite station?
- 96.7!

109
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:58,862
That's what I thought.

110
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:05,655
Okay, who am I gonna take? Tyrell,
my parents, cousins... Okay, Julie.

111
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:11,505
Mark said four tickets. So you
have to think of someone to bring.

112
00:17:18,097 --> 00:17:21,300
Ray? Phone.

113
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:33,019
- Hi.
- I'm really glad you called.

114
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:38,319
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left
so fast. I just...

115
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:41,201
It's okay. Ray, listen...

116
00:17:41,368 --> 00:17:47,074
Karla won a trip to the Bahamas,
to this island called Tower Bay.

117
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:51,246
- She wants us to go with her.
- The Bahamas?

118
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:59,297
It's a great chance for us to hang
out in the sun, drink, swim...

119
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,965
...and, well, you know.

120
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,509
- This weekend?
- Yeah.

121
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:13,812
- You wouldn't go away with me.
- It's not you. It's Southport.

122
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:18,940
- And, God, it's the Bahamas. Free.
- You have to sell his ass on it?

123
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:28,403
- I really want us to be together.
- We're in the middle of a big run.

124
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:34,120
It's been crazy. We go back out
later. I don't think I can make it.

125
00:18:36,254 --> 00:18:39,089
Will you try? For me, please?

126
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:42,792
Yeah, I'll try, but... Listen.

127
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:49,172
If I don't make it up, go ahead.
Have a really great time.

128
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,050
Ray, for me, try, please.

129
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,935
- I really miss you.
- I miss you, too.

130
00:18:57,107 --> 00:18:59,978
Okay.

131
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:03,106
Bye.

132
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:13,034
Dude, we haven't caught dick for
days. She asked you to the Bahamas.

133
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:17,250
Fuck it, man. You've got to go.
I'll ride up with you.

134
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,410
- Yeah. Stupid...
- Yeah, stupid.

135
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:25,462
What were you thinking, man?

136
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:29,963
I'll show you
what I've been thinking.

137
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,972
Whoa, Ray. Damn. Thanks, but I'll
need some time to think about it.

138
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:45,149
- Nice fit, huh?
- I'll call and tell her I'm coming.

139
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,653
No, surprise her. She'll be psyched.

140
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:53,733
Yeah. All right, clean up.

141
00:19:55,079 --> 00:20:00,204
Will you please forget about Ray?
That boy has got fish on the brains.

142
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:03,826
- Yeah, but...
- But nothing. Where are we going?

143
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:08,417
- The Bahamas.
- Where are we going..?

144
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:10,880
The Bahamas!

145
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,094
- Try the harmony.
- You try it. I'll lead.

146
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:30,560
- You, lead? You suck.
- Fuck you. I sound just like him.

147
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:38,198
- You don't sound anything like him.
- Are you deaf?

148
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,874
I'm quitting this band, man.
I'm going solo.

149
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,577
Oh, shit.

150
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:56,460
- Let's just go on and find a phone.
- No.

151
00:20:56,638 --> 00:21:01,014
Come on. The guy looks dead, man.

152
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:03,798
Maybe not.

153
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:08,395
What are you doing, man?

154
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:25,036
This is fucked up, man.

155
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:47,268
Shit.

156
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:04,907
Shit.

157
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:17,246
Dave!

158
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,799
No!

159
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,750
Girl, it's getting down to the wire.

160
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:12,175
He's not coming.
I just thought...

161
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:19,143
- You left him four messages. Four.
- He said he'd try.

162
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:23,181
Try is like maybe, Julie.
Try is bullshit.

163
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,060
- He does work hard.
- My ass...

164
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:33,323
He's breaking your heart because he
can. I hate to say I told you so.

165
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:36,738
Then don't.

166
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:40,415
Oh, my God.

167
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:44,534
What's happening, lovers?
Are we gonna get tropical?

168
00:23:44,713 --> 00:23:52,175
Let me talk to you for a minute...
What's up, Jules?

169
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:56,971
Julie, I'm really sorry about Will.
But he's my friend, too.

170
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:59,348
My ticket shouldn't go to waste.

171
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:05,016
Where there's a Will, there's a way.
Let's start having fun!

172
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,524
Is there a problem?

173
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:13,191
No, there's no problem,
because we're going to the Bahamas.

174
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:19,201
- You're goddamn right.
- Right. We're going to the Bahamas!

175
00:24:27,754 --> 00:24:34,005
- I'm in the exit row. Wrong row.
- Are you okay?

176
00:24:34,176 --> 00:24:38,044
Yeah, I'm fine.

177
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:42,557
Think of happy memories
from your childhood.

178
00:24:42,726 --> 00:24:49,345
And if I don't have any? I can't
relax going 500 miles an hour.

179
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:54,316
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks.
Planes go down for no reason at all.

180
00:24:54,487 --> 00:25:00,407
- Getting hit by lightning is...
- Yeah, and planes hit other planes.

181
00:25:00,577 --> 00:25:05,653
You're gonna get hit
if you don't quit bitching.

182
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:08,749
Some folks just can't fly.

183
00:25:11,795 --> 00:25:17,252
- I'm the king of the world!
- I'm the king of the world!

184
00:25:17,468 --> 00:25:22,046
- Just breathe, Tyrell.
- Get away from me.

185
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:25,259
It's not a macho thing. It's about
equilibrium in your inner ear.

186
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:31,768
You just have to get used to it.
Some folks just can't sail.

187
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:38,688
And it's the only way on or off the
island, except for the coast guard.

188
00:25:38,863 --> 00:25:43,489
- It looks pretty remote.
- Tourists want sun, sea, solitude.

189
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:48,486
- How much longer?
- A few minutes. Hang in there.

190
00:25:48,664 --> 00:25:51,036
Let it out. Just watch the boat.

191
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:21,307
If there's anything I can do to make
your stay better, please just ask.

192
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:27,440
I'm Darick. I'll be at your service
for the duration of your stay.

193
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:33,490
Old man, I have to work fast.
The season's almost over.

194
00:26:33,707 --> 00:26:38,285
With this weather you're already
out of time. Old man, my ass.

195
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:58,479
- Beautiful.
- Look at this.

196
00:27:02,984 --> 00:27:07,196
We are here.
We have arrived in paradise!

197
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:18,201
You've got to be shitting me...
Look at this cat.

198
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:23,326
- Yo, what's up, my brother?
- I think we found your brother.

199
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:27,418
- Your brother.
- You know what I was saying...

200
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:30,047
Are you looking for some bud?

201
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:33,718
I got some bat guano.
I got the cream jeans.

202
00:27:33,889 --> 00:27:36,890
Anything you need, Titus got.

203
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:43,392
- No, but thank you very much.
- What about the sweet young ladies?

204
00:27:43,564 --> 00:27:47,609
- Anything I can do?
- Take a bath.

205
00:27:47,777 --> 00:27:50,528
Damn, that's cold, woman. All right.

206
00:27:50,696 --> 00:27:55,192
If you need some weed,
I'll get with you later.

207
00:27:55,618 --> 00:28:00,160
- What's up? Looking for the disco?
- Beat it.

208
00:28:22,393 --> 00:28:25,062
Hello?

209
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:33,188
- Where is everyone?
- Good question.

210
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,613
Excuse me... Excuse me.

211
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:45,372
I'll scare somebody up. Hello?

212
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,909
Yo..? Shit!

213
00:28:57,593 --> 00:29:02,006
- What can I do for you?
- Checking in. Karla Wilson.

214
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:07,471
Oh, yes. Well, let's roll out
the red carpet.

215
00:29:07,686 --> 00:29:09,560
Our contest winners are here.

216
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,190
- Last name first. First name last.
- Nice dog you got there, man.

217
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:19,780
- Not really. He eats guys like you.
- You got a problem with something?

218
00:29:19,948 --> 00:29:25,736
- I don't have problems, pal.
- This is such a beautiful hotel.

219
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:32,164
Built in the 1930's
for one of the Rockefeller clan.

220
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,285
There's a lot of history here.
Judy Garland spent the night here.

221
00:29:34,461 --> 00:29:38,162
- President Nixon...
- Okay. We get it. It's old.

222
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:43,879
It'll outlive you, I'm sure.
Put that down, please.

223
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:47,505
Sorry.

224
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:55,352
"Wilson"... comma. "Karla. "

225
00:29:57,358 --> 00:30:01,485
Oh... You're in 201 and 202.

226
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:07,194
- Is that a bad thing?
- No, not at all. Not at all.

227
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:11,910
- Those are our honeymoon suites.
- Your what?

228
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,374
I take it
you kids haven't exchanged vows.

229
00:30:16,543 --> 00:30:21,881
- We haven't exchanged anything.
- Julie, come on. That'll be fine.

230
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:29,254
Our off-season staff of five
will tend to your every need.

231
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:34,555
- Did you say off-season?
- It's the Fourth of July weekend.

232
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:38,635
Storm season begins today
like clockwork.

233
00:30:38,814 --> 00:30:41,731
It's our version of winter.

234
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:49,229
That's 201 and 202. Scrabble
and Parcheesi in the lounge.

235
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:52,699
Enjoy.

236
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:58,741
Ain't nothing free in this world.
I wanted you to have a great trip.

237
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:03,287
We will. Don't worry about that.
We got the island to ourselves.

238
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:08,836
- And it's been blue skies all day.
- Guys, this is us. 202.

239
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:13,588
- The bags.
- 201 and 202.

240
00:31:13,764 --> 00:31:16,800
- Don't use these much.
- Why?

241
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:21,803
No reason. They're fancy rooms
for kids your age.

242
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,606
- We won a competition.
- And what did you have to do?

243
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:30,436
- Guess the capital of Brazil.
- Rio, baby.

244
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:37,024
Good for you, girl. And where
would you like I put your bags?

245
00:31:37,202 --> 00:31:42,743
- You can put our stuff back here.
- You promised.

246
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:48,337
- I also promised Tyrell.
- What's up? You're killing me.

247
00:31:48,505 --> 00:31:53,332
I can sleep on the couch so they can
practice that reaI honeymoon.

248
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:58,255
I've been doing this since before
you were a gleam in your dad's eye.

249
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:04,184
- You sure it's cool with you?
- Sure. As long as you don't snore.

250
00:32:04,353 --> 00:32:09,015
If I get out of hand,
you can toss something at me.

251
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:19,779
- He looks pretty beat up.
- Yeah. But he seems certain.

252
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:26,749
His friend was killed by a Ben
Willis, who had a hook on his hand -

253
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:30,451
- and was driving a BMW.

254
00:32:31,712 --> 00:32:35,331
Look, there's no body.
No other vehicle involved.

255
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:42,673
He feel asleep at the wheel, crashed
his truck and fell into a ditch.

256
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:49,390
- He suffered severe head trauma.
- It'll all come back to him.

257
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:55,308
Doctor, number three just flatlined.

258
00:32:57,737 --> 00:33:01,521
Get me some help.
I've got a flatline, room three.

259
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:18,044
Let's get a couple of drinks.

260
00:33:18,215 --> 00:33:21,465
Oh, shit.

261
00:33:21,635 --> 00:33:24,755
- This bar is...
- Empty?

262
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:30,137
- You boys lost?
- Wow, a human being.

263
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:34,889
- Tell me this isn't the bar scene.
- You want a drink?

264
00:33:35,106 --> 00:33:40,100
- We didn't dress up for nothing.
- You're dressed up?

265
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:46,564
All right, Will, we got a Planter's
Punch, a Singapore Sling...

266
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:50,906
How about a Mai-motherfucking-Tai?
Yeah...

267
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:56,246
How about some ID..?
I'm kidding.

268
00:33:57,794 --> 00:34:01,922
- This place isn't quiet, it's dead.
- Well, it's...

269
00:34:02,132 --> 00:34:05,749
- The last day of the season.
- Why are you still here?

270
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:12,260
That's none
of your goddamn business.

271
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:17,267
- I think I smell man trouble.
- Not anymore.

272
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,105
- Did he dump you?
- No. I shot him.

273
00:34:25,904 --> 00:34:30,198
Now, what you boys want
is a Dark and Stormy.

274
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:35,657
A little rum, ginger beer, Tabasco.
It's good. Trust me.

275
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,959
Am I bad? He's kind of cute, right?

276
00:34:40,126 --> 00:34:45,500
- And he has a crush on you. But?
- But I miss Ray.

277
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:49,967
- I really do. I tried to call him.
- Ray made up his own mind.

278
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:56,470
So you're free. For 48 hours, your
smile is a frown turned upside down.

279
00:34:57,601 --> 00:35:01,432
- Here comes my baby.
- You like the outfit?

280
00:35:01,604 --> 00:35:06,480
No, I love it. Cool bar, right?

281
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:10,066
They all look the same, once you've
worked in one. Right, sister?

282
00:35:10,237 --> 00:35:15,528
- You look beautiful.
- I'm Julie. This is Karla.

283
00:35:15,702 --> 00:35:19,829
Nancy. Well, welcome to
Tower Bay's most happening hot spot.

284
00:35:19,997 --> 00:35:23,615
Our room is the happening hot spot.

285
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:29,130
- Four Dark and Stormies.
- All right. To a great weekend.

286
00:35:29,297 --> 00:35:32,085
Screw the weather.

287
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:38,093
What do you do around here for fun?

288
00:35:38,264 --> 00:35:45,430
Make fun of tourists.
Or let them make fun of themselves.

289
00:35:45,605 --> 00:35:49,519
- Karaoke. Perfect.
- That's what I'm talking about.

290
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:54,692
- Don't even think about it.
- Don't listen to the party-poopers.

291
00:35:54,864 --> 00:35:58,398
This is for someone who needs it.

292
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,362
- So one single with extra cheese.
- No.

293
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:04,863
- Yes, Julie.
- No... No!

294
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:10,917
- What did I say?
- Come on, Julie. Come on...

295
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:15,007
Julie in the house!

296
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:21,343
Ladies and gentlemen, a round
of applause for my very best friend.

297
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:27,219
- Julie James!
- Julie in the house. Julie...

298
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:34,513
- All right... Thank you, Karla.
- You're welcome.

299
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,158
Are you happy?

300
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,792
Hi, Will...

301
00:37:11,144 --> 00:37:13,136
Everyone's a goddamn singer.

302
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:20,436
I don't know the lyrics. Hold on.

303
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:33,909
It's him. He did something
to the screen. I swear to God.

304
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:37,452
- Julie, what's wrong?
- I swear to God, it said...

305
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:45,589
- Julie, what are you talking about?
- Nothing.

306
00:37:45,761 --> 00:37:49,627
Where are you going? Julie?
Shit...

307
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:50,858
- Oh, my God. Will, I'm so sorry.
- It's my fault.

308
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:56,066
- I shouldn't have. I didn't think.
- This is so sweet. I'm sorry.

309
00:38:56,244 --> 00:39:01,285
- I scared you. I crossed the line.
- You scared me, but I'm on edge.

310
00:39:01,457 --> 00:39:05,157
- Sorry.
- Don't apologise. I'm the one...

311
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:09,036
I understand.

312
00:39:09,256 --> 00:39:12,340
I'm just gonna take a walk.

313
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:16,376
Are you sure?

314
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:29,934
I just really like you a lot.
I want you to have a great time.

315
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:33,525
I want you to be happy.

316
00:39:44,623 --> 00:39:48,573
I'll just grab a few things here.

317
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:54,497
God, I'm sorry.

318
00:39:58,595 --> 00:40:01,714
Sorry.

319
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:13,732
- Bounce, baby.
- You know what?

320
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:18,609
I've decided
to change my major to finance.

321
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,074
And I'm going to Wall Street.
You know why?

322
00:40:23,243 --> 00:40:27,904
Because it's the only way I can
afford a big-ass bed like this.

323
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,374
Show me some love
on this big-ass bed.

324
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:37,121
- Oh, a Jacuzzi.
- Come on, let's stay right here.

325
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:45,050
I spent $100 on a bathing suit. You
can pull it off, but I'm wearing it.

326
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:48,341
You didn't mention that earlier,
sexy thing.

327
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:53,452
- You scared the shit out of me!
- You're living your life in fear.

328
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:59,908
It's time for manhood. There's
a kick-ass party on the mainland.

329
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:04,996
I'm saying we take the boat
and get jiggy with it.

330
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:11,092
I have to tie the boat. There's a
storm coming. Then I'm going to bed.

331
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:14,713
- And that's it?
- That's all I got for today.

332
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:19,724
- Take the bake elsewhere.
- All right... Bullshit.

333
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:24,563
You need to take a chill pill.

334
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:29,275
- Have a good time, bro.
- I will, buddy.

335
00:42:37,912 --> 00:42:40,913
Titus!

336
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:45,539
Oh, damn it.

337
00:42:45,712 --> 00:42:49,708
Very funny, asshole.

338
00:42:52,176 --> 00:42:55,759
Hey, give me a hand, would you?

339
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,452
- Long distance.
- I need an international operator.

340
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:02,485
Come on!

341
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:23,922
Housekeeping.

342
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:40,733
Housekeeping.

343
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:41,366
- What, what, what?
- Have you seen my hair tie?

344
00:45:41,545 --> 00:45:46,621
I'm sorry, baby. I just
don't want to get my hair wet.

345
00:45:46,799 --> 00:45:51,794
I finally got you in this Jacuzzi.
Let's not talk about hair care.

346
00:45:51,971 --> 00:45:56,763
- Don't get feisty.
- It's too late for all that.

347
00:45:56,976 --> 00:46:02,432
We're miles away from anybody.
So nobody can hear you scream.

348
00:46:02,648 --> 00:46:08,768
I used to be a lifeguard. And please
don't make me blow my whistle.

349
00:46:08,946 --> 00:46:15,482
I'd just hate
for you to blow... your whistle.

350
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:24,038
No water sports after midnight.
Hotel policy.

351
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:29,750
- What's the policy on burning herb?
- You can't try it till you buy it.

352
00:46:32,509 --> 00:46:38,464
What's up? It's all good.
Believe me, it is all good.

353
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:43,225
Crazy freak.

354
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:49,859
Now, where was I?

355
00:46:57,033 --> 00:47:00,816
- Hey, guys. Isn't this beautiful?
- Damn.

356
00:47:01,036 --> 00:47:05,164
10 people on this island,
and they all end up in this Jacuzzi.

357
00:47:05,332 --> 00:47:09,376
- How's the water?
- Crowded.

358
00:47:09,544 --> 00:47:14,835
- How's Julie doing?
- She's up in her room alone.

359
00:47:15,008 --> 00:47:19,634
- Any advise?
- Find another Jacuzzi.

360
00:47:19,804 --> 00:47:25,510
You can't give up so easy.
You've got to hang in there.

361
00:47:25,727 --> 00:47:28,762
It's great, isn't it?

362
00:47:28,938 --> 00:47:33,267
I can't win. I can't...

363
00:47:45,537 --> 00:47:48,288
Will?

364
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:09,606
Where the hell's my toothbrush?

365
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,347
- Hey, I know, I know...
- Will!

366
00:50:26,564 --> 00:50:29,601
Will! It's happening again.

367
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,362
What happened?

368
00:50:39,243 --> 00:50:42,529
I do not find this at all funny.

369
00:50:42,747 --> 00:50:45,368
There was a body. I swear it.

370
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:50,369
- Maybe you were dreaming.
- I wasn't.

371
00:50:50,546 --> 00:50:54,673
I knew you were gonna be trouble
the moment I laid eyes on you.

372
00:50:54,841 --> 00:50:59,717
- Listen to me. He's here.
- What's going on?

373
00:50:59,888 --> 00:51:04,715
Julie says she saw a dead guy in
the closet. All we see is bathrobes.

374
00:51:04,934 --> 00:51:10,854
You think this is funny? I'm not
going crazy. He was in there.

375
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:15,068
Oh, yeah? Then where is he now?
Where's the dead guy?

376
00:51:15,277 --> 00:51:22,026
- What did you actually see?
- The dockhand hanging by his neck.

377
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:30,030
Look, tomorrow we'll talk to Darick
and put this whole thing to rest.

378
00:51:30,209 --> 00:51:35,415
So let's slow down on the Dark
and Stormies and get some sleep.

379
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:40,209
- I want off this island.
- That's not possible.

380
00:51:40,384 --> 00:51:44,631
The last ferry left hours ago,
and we have a storm coming.

381
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:51,342
- I'll call the mainland for a boat.
- The phones just went down.

382
00:51:55,274 --> 00:51:58,109
It's dead.

383
00:51:58,277 --> 00:52:03,781
Listen up. The next couple of days
will be rough, but we'll make it.

384
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:07,276
- What about a radio?
- Emergencies only.

385
00:52:07,452 --> 00:52:12,612
You city kids wouldn't know
a hurricane if it blew up your ass.

386
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:22,544
This is not a drill. All we can do
is batten down and ride it out.

387
00:52:22,716 --> 00:52:27,710
And if it gets really bad,
we have a storm shelter. Goodnight.

388
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:59,782
Pain of the past, fear
of the future, blood of the young.

389
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:06,045
Pain of the past, fear
of the future, blood of the young.

390
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:10,759
Pain of the past,
fear of the future...

391
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:13,883
...blood of the young.

392
00:53:26,986 --> 00:53:34,530
Yeah, that's my babies.
You all growed up real good.

393
00:53:47,088 --> 00:53:54,218
Where are you hiding?
Come to Papa, come to Papa...

394
00:53:54,386 --> 00:53:58,550
Yeah, that's it.

395
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:01,303
Got to find that damn lighter...

396
00:54:12,695 --> 00:54:16,444
Can I help you?

397
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:20,402
Goddamn it!

398
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:26,494
Oh, God...

399
00:54:28,044 --> 00:54:33,085
What are you doing? No.
Seriously, don't do that.

400
00:54:36,343 --> 00:54:40,423
Oh, God... Jesus, no!

401
00:54:40,597 --> 00:54:42,969
It's all good!

402
00:55:07,998 --> 00:55:10,667
Can I help you?

403
00:55:20,218 --> 00:55:23,136
- That's a full carat.
- How much?

404
00:55:23,305 --> 00:55:27,432
- She's got some flaws in her.
- How much?

405
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:32,642
I don't have much of a market
for this kind of thing.

406
00:55:32,855 --> 00:55:37,066
- 200. Maybe 250.
- Make it 300.

407
00:55:39,278 --> 00:55:42,279
And throw in that, too.

408
00:55:45,033 --> 00:55:50,110
Which one you talking about? You're
crazy. That's worth 300 by itself.

409
00:55:50,288 --> 00:55:55,828
- Then there's the waiting period.
- Keep the ring and give me the gun.

410
00:56:08,347 --> 00:56:12,095
- You sure you want to go this way?
- Is it loaded?

411
00:56:12,267 --> 00:56:14,840
- No.
- Load it.

412
00:56:27,866 --> 00:56:30,403
Get the hell off of me.

413
00:56:32,578 --> 00:56:38,533
Baby, this is bullshit. This ain't
the romantic weekend I had in mind.

414
00:56:38,751 --> 00:56:42,285
Hey, Jules, get any sleep?

415
00:56:42,462 --> 00:56:45,547
- Some.
- Look at that.

416
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:51,753
Another beautiful day in paradise
with Julie as our tour director.

417
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:57,434
- Do you see any fresh kill?
- Shut up, Ty.

418
00:56:57,602 --> 00:57:01,849
- How about a Freddie or Jason?
- Leave her alone, man.

419
00:57:02,023 --> 00:57:08,310
It's bad enough getting rained out
without having to hold her hand.

420
00:57:08,487 --> 00:57:14,407
- Don't be an asshole about it.
- It's okay. He doesn't believe me.

421
00:57:14,577 --> 00:57:20,946
- It's his right. Maybe I am crazy.
- Nobody thinks you're crazy.

422
00:57:21,124 --> 00:57:24,410
- I do.
- Why don't you go do something?

423
00:57:24,628 --> 00:57:28,921
I don't want to do nothing with him.
I want to do something with you.

424
00:57:30,341 --> 00:57:36,461
Let's go to the gym and work off
some stress. You're not crazy.

425
00:57:42,269 --> 00:57:48,639
Look, we need to find stoner boy
and get pool sticks or something...

426
00:57:48,817 --> 00:57:52,862
The greenhouse effect
has caused the Gulf Stream to shift.

427
00:57:53,030 --> 00:58:00,610
Experts expect a dramatic increase
of hurricanes, coastal flooding...

428
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:04,446
It wouldn't take much
to wipe us off this island.

429
00:58:04,623 --> 00:58:07,328
Shut up, okay? Shut up.

430
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:10,752
God!

431
00:58:12,382 --> 00:58:15,132
Come on!

432
00:58:18,303 --> 00:58:21,305
This is a nice gym.

433
00:58:26,645 --> 00:58:28,803
Nice move.

434
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:33,309
I'm gonna give your fisherman some
of this and see how he likes it.

435
00:59:00,051 --> 00:59:03,634
Oh, poor baby.

436
00:59:03,805 --> 00:59:06,889
You know what? I got a better idea.

437
00:59:07,058 --> 00:59:10,224
You're not leaving this island
till you get a tan.

438
00:59:14,023 --> 00:59:18,980
- Wow. Cancer in a box.
- No, this is the safe sun.

439
00:59:19,152 --> 00:59:22,356
It's better than
a day on the beach, girl.

440
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,447
With a little photosynthesis
you'll feel like a new...

441
00:59:29,621 --> 00:59:33,204
- House plant?
- Exactly. Bye.

442
01:00:14,372 --> 01:00:17,954
- Sure this is the way to the pool?
- There's his cart.

443
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:21,744
The fucking idiot
left it in the rain.

444
01:00:57,037 --> 01:01:02,576
Dryer. "Gee, Karla,
that'll break the machine. "

445
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:06,962
Damn. How many pairs are in there?

446
01:01:20,392 --> 01:01:23,310
Hey, pool boy!

447
01:01:24,188 --> 01:01:27,023
Yo, Bob Marley!

448
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:30,144
You in there or what?

449
01:02:03,434 --> 01:02:06,269
Karla?

450
01:02:09,773 --> 01:02:12,857
Karla?

451
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:42,798
Come on!

452
01:02:55,858 --> 01:02:58,064
Tyrell!

453
01:02:59,153 --> 01:03:01,905
You guys, help me!

454
01:03:08,078 --> 01:03:10,403
Use this. Just smash it.

455
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:17,917
Come on.

456
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:23,633
I told you I'm not crazy. He's here.
We've got to call for help.

457
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:27,846
Man, this classifies
as a fucking emergency!

458
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:40,525
Hey, Brooks. Where the fuck you at?
We want off this fucking island.

459
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:45,188
- Oh, shit.
- We've got to get the fuck out.

460
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:55,622
Julie!

461
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:09,376
- Where are the boats?
- They were cut loose.

462
01:04:09,553 --> 01:04:15,472
- Julie, what the fuck is going on?
- He's gonna kill us one by one.

463
01:04:15,642 --> 01:04:19,805
- Who?
- Ben Willis.

464
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:25,685
- Willis is dead. You killed him.
- They never found the body.

465
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:32,574
We lied. We hit him with our car
and threw his body in the water.

466
01:04:32,742 --> 01:04:37,035
Only he didn't die. Last Fourth
of July he killed Barry and Helen.

467
01:04:37,204 --> 01:04:40,787
I thought Ray and I killed him,
but we didn't.

468
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:45,003
- He's back to finish it off!
- We're in the middle of nowhere.

469
01:04:45,212 --> 01:04:49,838
There's dead bodies piling up
and there's only one guy missing.

470
01:04:50,008 --> 01:04:54,800
- The porter. What's his name?
- Estes. The fucker knows something.

471
01:04:54,971 --> 01:04:59,680
We can sit here like assholes
or go find him first.

472
01:04:59,851 --> 01:05:03,931
- It's not him.
- We have to do something.

473
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:08,524
I'm with him.

474
01:05:09,485 --> 01:05:12,439
Come on.

475
01:05:12,613 --> 01:05:17,191
How can you not tell me the whole
story? I'm your best friend!

476
01:05:17,367 --> 01:05:23,121
- I didn't want to involve anybody.
- Well, it's too late for that now.

477
01:05:24,332 --> 01:05:28,033
Come on, let's go!

478
01:06:22,596 --> 01:06:29,015
Hey, Estes. You sick bastard,
are you in here?

479
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:34,349
You hear me? Sick mother...

480
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:40,608
- He's not here, man.
- There's some crazy shit in here.

481
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:53,076
No doubt.
This is our fucking killer.

482
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,785
This is our fucking guy.

483
01:07:21,026 --> 01:07:23,398
You guys.

484
01:07:31,077 --> 01:07:33,747
Shit.

485
01:07:35,122 --> 01:07:38,123
Fuck.

486
01:07:43,465 --> 01:07:46,880
- Anyone missing a hair tie?
- Shit. That's mine.

487
01:07:49,762 --> 01:07:53,048
What about a toothbrush?

488
01:08:00,439 --> 01:08:03,771
Voodoo.

489
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:09,814
We need flashlights, guns, whatever
we need to get off this island.

490
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:15,825
- What if he's down there?
- Let's just get the fuck out.

491
01:08:17,288 --> 01:08:22,282
- You wait here.
- It's safer up here.

492
01:08:22,459 --> 01:08:26,374
I'll just be a second.

493
01:08:44,564 --> 01:08:47,897
Julie, where are you going?

494
01:08:56,325 --> 01:08:58,815
What the hell was that?

495
01:08:58,994 --> 01:09:03,572
Shit. Julie?

496
01:09:35,446 --> 01:09:40,784
- Brazilia.
- Julie, watch out!

497
01:09:42,744 --> 01:09:47,489
That's the capital of Brazil.
Not Rio.

498
01:09:50,668 --> 01:09:55,128
No, guys! Leave him alone!

499
01:09:55,339 --> 01:09:59,586
- This is the killer.
- We've seen the voodoo stuff.

500
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,429
I found the bodies this morning.
I tried the radio, it was destroyed.

501
01:10:05,598 --> 01:10:10,391
- Leave him alone. I believe him.
- I haven't hurt anyone.

502
01:10:10,562 --> 01:10:14,773
I stole those things to protect you.

503
01:10:14,941 --> 01:10:21,145
He could have killed me, but didn't.
We didn't answer the question right.

504
01:10:21,364 --> 01:10:25,990
This whole thing was a set-up.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil.

505
01:10:26,201 --> 01:10:28,574
Sorry. We lose.

506
01:10:28,746 --> 01:10:32,577
- So where's this Ben Willis guy?
- I don't know.

507
01:10:32,749 --> 01:10:39,001
You never know. How do we know
you didn't set this whole thing up?

508
01:10:39,214 --> 01:10:44,421
- How do we know you didn't?
- I know who you're talking about.

509
01:10:46,179 --> 01:10:53,593
He used to work here. I've seen
him by the orchard. I'll show you.

510
01:10:53,769 --> 01:10:59,475
- He could be setting us up.
- I'm not staying here.

511
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:04,312
We're better off in the open. Maybe
we can kill this asshole for good.

512
01:11:06,573 --> 01:11:09,195
Show us.

513
01:11:26,801 --> 01:11:30,086
What the hell..?

514
01:11:31,305 --> 01:11:35,255
- I need to get to Tower Bay Island.
- We're closed.

515
01:11:35,434 --> 01:11:38,138
I need to get to that island now.

516
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:44,480
Let me ask you, did you happen
to see what it's like outside?

517
01:11:44,651 --> 01:11:51,152
I'm not looking for a weather
report. So which boat is yours?

518
01:11:51,324 --> 01:11:54,740
He worked here for many years.

519
01:11:54,911 --> 01:11:58,445
Raised a family. Pretty wife.

520
01:11:58,622 --> 01:12:01,742
Two little ones. A boy and a girl.

521
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:05,002
One day the wife went missing.

522
01:12:05,171 --> 01:12:10,413
The maid found blood
all over the honeymoon suite. 201.

523
01:12:10,634 --> 01:12:15,260
Eventually they found the body.
Pieces of it, at least.

524
01:12:15,471 --> 01:12:18,508
People say she was cheating on him.

525
01:12:18,683 --> 01:12:23,226
People say he would beat her.
People say a lot of things.

526
01:12:23,396 --> 01:12:28,603
He disappeared. Children, too.

527
01:12:28,776 --> 01:12:34,150
- Now he's back.
- Julie, be careful.

528
01:12:34,323 --> 01:12:37,822
I've got to see.

529
01:13:03,976 --> 01:13:09,137
- What's today's date?
- July fourth.

530
01:13:15,278 --> 01:13:22,324
I'm not gonna die on this island.
Do you hear me? I'm right here.

531
01:13:22,493 --> 01:13:27,321
- But my grave stays empty!
- This is crazy.

532
01:13:27,499 --> 01:13:32,837
- No phones, no boats, no way out.
- Yeah? Then we fight.

533
01:13:33,045 --> 01:13:36,877
- Where did Estes go?
- Why? He can't help us anyway.

534
01:13:37,049 --> 01:13:43,336
- Only he can. I'll find him.
- Are you gonna leave us here?

535
01:13:43,555 --> 01:13:49,593
- It's okay. He can't have gone far.
- Meet us back at the hotel, okay?

536
01:13:49,769 --> 01:13:54,348
Okay? Come on, let's go.

537
01:14:21,091 --> 01:14:25,800
What I need is a gun, not a knife.
But fuck it.

538
01:14:28,014 --> 01:14:31,015
What are you gonna do with those?
Butter him?

539
01:14:31,184 --> 01:14:35,264
Clean vegetables? Take this.

540
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:40,308
- You ready?
- Yeah.

541
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:47,026
Shit... Hey, are you okay?

542
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:50,200
We're gonna get this fucker, right?

543
01:14:50,369 --> 01:14:56,453
- Right? Let's head to the pantry.
- Why? Is that a good place to hide?

544
01:14:56,624 --> 01:15:00,207
I don't know.
I'm just fucking hungry.

545
01:15:01,838 --> 01:15:07,591
Estes, where did you go?
You said you were gonna help us.

546
01:15:10,179 --> 01:15:15,054
You should have told us
you had a boat.

547
01:15:15,225 --> 01:15:19,555
- We're not going anywhere.
- What?

548
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:34,735
- Baby, don't go in here.
- It's only food. Don't worry, baby.

549
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:46,623
Stop trying to act
like you ain't hungry.

550
01:16:15,324 --> 01:16:18,609
It's just a stupid rat.

551
01:16:18,785 --> 01:16:21,989
No, Nancy!

552
01:16:39,222 --> 01:16:44,513
Come in. Come in!
Come on...

553
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:50,016
The Arcadian requests emergency
assistance for Tower Bay Island.

554
01:16:50,232 --> 01:16:54,894
I repeat, this is the Arcadian
requesting emergency assistance.

555
01:17:04,872 --> 01:17:08,999
So that's where
the flashlights were.

556
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:13,959
- Sorry, but it could have been you.
- Or you, you crazy bitch.

557
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:18,839
- You broke into my hiding place.
- Sorry, I missed the sign.

558
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:24,050
This place didn't have a murder rate
till you people showed up.

559
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:33,565
- I never saw a dead body before.
- Get used to it.

560
01:17:33,773 --> 01:17:37,225
- Who's doing this?
- Here we go.

561
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:42,947
Don't get her started. It's a long,
fucked-up story you won't believe.

562
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:50,032
This is the worst vacation in my
life. I'm tired, hungry and horny.

563
01:17:50,206 --> 01:17:55,081
And personally, I haven't seen
one goddamn psycho killer.

564
01:18:08,265 --> 01:18:13,424
Come on! I know where we can hide.
Come on!

565
01:18:32,162 --> 01:18:35,247
Karla, come on!

566
01:18:50,972 --> 01:18:54,305
Karla!

567
01:18:57,561 --> 01:19:00,515
Shit... It won't lock!

568
01:19:04,193 --> 01:19:07,691
Follow me. Stay on the beams.

569
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:20,708
Jesus Christ, that's my bedroom.

570
01:19:30,551 --> 01:19:33,718
Come on, give me your hand.
Come on!

571
01:19:33,888 --> 01:19:37,885
Come on... Come on!

572
01:19:40,852 --> 01:19:44,351
You sick freak!

573
01:19:44,564 --> 01:19:47,399
Come on!

574
01:19:53,114 --> 01:19:56,530
Karla!

575
01:20:02,165 --> 01:20:04,619
Karla!

576
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:08,161
Shit, shit...

577
01:20:20,098 --> 01:20:24,724
- We've got to do something.
- She'll never make it. Come on.

578
01:20:24,936 --> 01:20:27,391
Get off me!

579
01:20:27,563 --> 01:20:29,936
Oh, shit.

580
01:20:34,069 --> 01:20:37,236
Oh, shit.

581
01:22:08,617 --> 01:22:12,117
Damn, it's locked.

582
01:22:13,205 --> 01:22:19,124
- Are you okay?
- I'll live. It's locked.

583
01:22:19,294 --> 01:22:23,043
- We've got to open the door.
- We'll get you out. I promise.

584
01:22:28,928 --> 01:22:32,345
Karla!

585
01:22:36,477 --> 01:22:39,846
Shit... Come on, Nancy.

586
01:22:50,074 --> 01:22:53,074
Come on, open the door.

587
01:22:54,494 --> 01:23:00,034
- I can't find it.
- Get out of the way.

588
01:23:01,417 --> 01:23:05,166
Get out of the way!

589
01:23:11,051 --> 01:23:14,385
Karla, come on!

590
01:23:27,109 --> 01:23:32,185
- Where are we going?
- The storm shelter!

591
01:23:41,747 --> 01:23:46,706
Don't worry. I know there's
emergency power here somewhere.

592
01:23:47,961 --> 01:23:52,089
- Hey, Julie?
- Just grab hold of my hand.

593
01:23:52,299 --> 01:23:57,044
- Just grab hold of my hand.
- I am holding your hand.

594
01:23:58,972 --> 01:24:02,257
No, you're not.

595
01:24:20,492 --> 01:24:23,493
- Are you okay?
- It's Will!

596
01:24:23,662 --> 01:24:28,371
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.

597
01:24:34,256 --> 01:24:39,131
Everything is gonna be okay.
Just get inside. Estes attacked me.

598
01:24:39,344 --> 01:24:44,634
- You think he's a part of this?
- I don't know. Let's get inside.

599
01:24:44,848 --> 01:24:51,136
- I don't think we should go inside.
- The slicker guy was on the beach.

600
01:25:00,864 --> 01:25:04,067
Jesus, you're bleeding to death.
We need a first-aid kit.

601
01:25:04,242 --> 01:25:09,153
- I think there's one in the lobby.
- All right, just sit there.

602
01:25:09,372 --> 01:25:16,537
- Don't worry. He's gone. Just go.
- Look, I'll go with you. Come on.

603
01:25:18,381 --> 01:25:20,872
Listen, Will. You're gonna be okay.

604
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:24,715
Jesus, there's blood everywhere.

605
01:25:27,514 --> 01:25:29,756
I can't find a wound.

606
01:25:29,934 --> 01:25:34,262
That's because it's not my blood.

607
01:25:35,313 --> 01:25:38,765
What?

608
01:25:39,651 --> 01:25:43,779
It's not my blood, Julie.

609
01:25:59,211 --> 01:26:03,422
What's your favourite radio station?

610
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:13,218
What's your favourite radio station?
96.7.

611
01:26:13,391 --> 01:26:17,554
It's time for you to contemplate
the ultimate getaway.

612
01:26:31,784 --> 01:26:35,532
Here, take that. Come on...

613
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:42,750
Estes...

614
01:26:43,503 --> 01:26:46,124
Fuck.

615
01:26:49,133 --> 01:26:51,126
Get off me!

616
01:26:51,302 --> 01:26:54,220
Get up...

617
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:59,179
God, no!

618
01:27:22,165 --> 01:27:25,948
We finally get to spend
some quality time together.

619
01:27:26,127 --> 01:27:29,994
- Why are you doing this to me?
- It's always about you.

620
01:27:30,172 --> 01:27:35,842
"I have bad dreams. I can't sleep.
I have trouble with my boyfriend. "

621
01:27:36,011 --> 01:27:42,594
You never take responsibility for
anything you do. Not even murder.

622
01:27:46,771 --> 01:27:51,479
What did you do that for?
You're a bitch.

623
01:27:54,236 --> 01:27:59,148
- That's gonna leave a mark.
- Tell me why.

624
01:27:59,325 --> 01:28:03,488
Come on, think. You'll get it.
Will Benson.

625
01:28:05,873 --> 01:28:09,159
Ben's son.

626
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:13,076
Hi, Dad.

627
01:28:23,556 --> 01:28:30,223
Hush, now. No more screaming.
No more running. It's time to die.

628
01:28:30,396 --> 01:28:34,607
Let her go... Let her go.

629
01:28:34,775 --> 01:28:37,894
You've got to be shitting me!

630
01:28:38,069 --> 01:28:44,108
- What will you do? Call us names?
- Let her go now!

631
01:28:44,284 --> 01:28:48,577
Think about it, boy.
You're no killer. That's my job.

632
01:28:51,833 --> 01:28:55,878
You don't have it in you.

633
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:34,742
Sure did miss you down here, Ray.
Too bad. We could have been friends.

634
01:29:34,915 --> 01:29:40,336
Really, man.
I would have shared her with you.

635
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:48,835
Come on, Ray. Stay with me.
You see that?

636
01:29:49,012 --> 01:29:53,839
I want you to think about all
the things we're gonna do to her.

637
01:29:57,145 --> 01:30:00,395
- You want him, Dad?
- Stand him up.

638
01:30:37,016 --> 01:30:40,930
Just... fucking... die!

639
01:31:43,621 --> 01:31:47,120
This is the Coast Guard.
Remain where you are.

640
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:51,538
The rescue team
will be with you shortly.

641
01:31:52,254 --> 01:31:54,579
Julie...

642
01:31:58,927 --> 01:32:03,718
Karla... God, I thought
I would never see you again.

643
01:32:03,889 --> 01:32:08,184
Girl, you don't have to worry
about me. I'm made of steel.

644
01:32:12,357 --> 01:32:17,065
- Good old Ray.
- Hey, Karla.

645
01:32:20,906 --> 01:32:25,366
If anyone asks, let's not tell them
it rained the whole time.

646
01:32:26,912 --> 01:32:30,910
- It'll be our little secret.
- Yeah.

647
01:33:14,123 --> 01:33:19,746
I almost fell asleep on the couch.
You didn't tell me how late it was.

648
01:33:21,714 --> 01:33:24,834
- Were you checking the locks again?
- You know me too well.

649
01:33:26,677 --> 01:33:30,804
Don't you dare go to sleep, girl.

650
01:34:21,229 --> 01:34:24,561
I love this thing.

651
01:35:24,455 --> 01:35:31,204
Julie, what the hell
is your problem? Just... stop.
