2
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:50,143
- You're lying to me.
- I'm not!

3
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,749
I don't know what you're talkin' about, I don't
know what you want from me, I swear I don't.

4
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:56,282
I have three children.

5
00:00:56,318 --> 00:01:02,391
The first thing you have to learn as a father,
is to know when your children are lying to you.

6
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:05,142
You're lying to me.

7
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:11,189
And if you don't stop, I'm going to use one
of those tortures your people are so famous for,

8
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,843
on your little body until you
tell me what I want to know.

9
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:26,612
For the last time,
give me the numbers.

10
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:50,935
- How dare you come here?
- Mom! Enough! Stop!

11
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:56,205
You have no right to be here!
No right!You should be in jail!

12
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:01,242
- You get out of here! You get out of here!
- Sorry.

13
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:04,147
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

14
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,694
You piece of Garbage!
He should never have been in there with me.

15
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:24,901
- Luke! C'mon! What! Are you crazy, Man?
- Get off! Get off!

16
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:30,373
I never liked you, Luke. You're a better fighter
than 90% of the guys you go in the cage with,

17
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:33,576
but you just let 'em pound on ya
like you're a side of beef.

18
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:36,043
You already lost to every chump in the circuit...

19
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:40,677
but last night, of all nights, you're supposed
to go down in the 2nd, you sonofabitch.

20
00:03:40,713 --> 00:03:42,125
- Once!
- Back off!

21
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:42,863
I hit him once!

22
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:46,789
Where'd ya find him, a fuckin' playground?
- YouTube, you asshole.

23
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:49,839
The kid's a internet sensation
until you put him in a coma.

24
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:54,672
Which, frankly, I do not give a shit about.
But you cost me a million dollars!

25
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,738
Which is nothing compared
to what you cost Docheski.

26
00:03:58,182 --> 00:04:00,717
Yeah! You recognize the name?

27
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:05,366
He was bettin' on you big time to take the dive!
And he's gonna take it out on me, too!

28
00:04:05,403 --> 00:04:08,678
'Cause he knows I'm the schmuck
that set this whole thing up.

29
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,217
Unless I deliver your
head with a down payment.

30
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,255
You know how the Russians are.

31
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:32,154
<i>You got the right number,
so leave the right message.</i>

32
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,088
Call me when you get this, Annie.
Call me right away.

33
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,995
If you're out, don't go home.
If I'm scarin' you, that's good. Call me.

34
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:44,227
Annie?

35
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,532
Is that it?

36
00:07:13,477 --> 00:07:15,188
I heard you were some kind of tough guy.

37
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:18,421
No fighting?

38
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:22,774
You just going to sit on the floor
like a dog who wants to die?

39
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,976
Sorry it had to be so messy.

40
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,513
The boys are still learning.

41
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,415
And I'm not a doctor,
but I thing she was eating for two.

42
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,566
Like the Charlie Manson family.

43
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:39,253
My father was going to send someone else,
but I'm making my bones.

44
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:43,977
You make your bones by killin'
someone who can hurt you back!

45
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:47,736
And who would that be? You?

46
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,293
Well, why not?
You just killed your wife.

47
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:55,507
I didn't kill her...you did!

48
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:58,024
But...you want to hurt me?

49
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:01,848
Good! I want to see you try.

50
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,352
- Get it over with!
- Over?

51
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:09,292
You've cost my father money...
made my family look bad.

52
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:12,368
Now we're going to make an
extra special example out of you.

53
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:15,627
So! We looked into your
records...not much to find.

54
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,414
Work for City, garbage
collection, sanitation.

55
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,882
Good benefits, but no glamour, eh?

56
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:23,361
Father and mother...dead!

57
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,289
No brothers or sisters,
which is too bad.

58
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:31,409
Because I would like to
take them from you, too.

59
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:34,981
But you love your wife.

60
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:36,163
We know that.

61
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:41,914
So! Here's the deal: You are free to go,
but we will have eyes on you.

62
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:45,548
<i>Not always. But when you
least expect it...we'll be there.</i>

63
00:08:45,704 --> 00:08:48,271
<i>Anyone you try to make
friends with or even talk to</i>

64
00:08:48,272 --> 00:08:51,030
<i>or anything or bring hot dog or anything...</i>

65
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:54,727
<i>will die...like your wife...
because of you.</i>

66
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:59,628
<i>Of course you can always end it! Jump off
a bridge...throw yourself in front of a train.</i>

67
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:03,423
<i>Damn your eternal soul to hell,
if you believe in that kind of bullshit.</i>

68
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:07,280
<i>Personally...I don't!
So, I'd go for it, but...</i>

69
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:13,848
but I am not you...thank God.

70
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:17,090
<i>So do what you want.</i>

71
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:20,968
<i>If you stay here tomorrow,
we're going to kill the landlady.</i>

72
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,562
<i>- What was her name?
- Tobeloski is her name.</i>

73
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,432
<i>Mrs. Tobeloski.
Nice lady.</i>

74
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:30,957
Clean up the mess, Garbageman.

75
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,897
All right! She's your daughter
and she's an American citizen.

76
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:43,464
I ain't gonna ask what the deal is
with her, that's your business.

77
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:47,446
But I'm gonna tell ya,
pullin' strings is hard work.

78
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:50,007
And hard work don't come free.

79
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:53,629
Your price, Captain Wolf?

80
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:56,960
Chinatown Precinct take goes up 20%.

81
00:09:57,042 --> 00:10:01,480
Bronx on your 21st, Brooklyn
Divisions each go up by 12%...monthly.

82
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:05,556
That's a steep price for a passport
and some papers for a little girl.

83
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:08,180
Things are tough all over.

84
00:10:13,474 --> 00:10:17,349
Chinatown gives-up 10% off. Bronx and
Brooklyn will stand by the current rate.

85
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:22,071
And the fact that we won't start shooting cops
and their families in the streets like dogs

86
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:23,712
at the first signs of pressure.

87
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:27,741
Things are tough all over.

88
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:50,187
Hey, Man, I know you, I saw you fight
in Jersey. That was really good.

89
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:52,037
You knocked that guy out!

90
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,822
I got some good shit, man.

91
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,735
Good fight.

92
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:57,140
Exactly 800,000?

93
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:59,831
Almost 800.

94
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:07,365
I'm not asking you if it's almost 800,
I want the exact number.

95
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:12,711
$785,370.

96
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:17,156
And the week before?

97
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,488
It's losing money.

98
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:19,742
- What?
- Why?

99
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:23,738
Because he was hurting business,
and business is a serious matter.

100
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:29,197
I understand business, but why beat him
if we are going to kill him anyway?

101
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:56,635
- You can't come in here.
- I gotta get something to eat, Man!

102
00:13:56,672 --> 00:13:59,830
Well, you can't! Go back, Man!

103
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:03,411
<i>Lights out! Lights out in five.</i>

104
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,897
Nice kicks.

105
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:27,587
Better be here in the mornin'.

106
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,596
or you'll be wearin' 'em on your ears,

107
00:14:29,597 --> 00:14:31,933
or chewin' your feet off
to your god damned ankles.

108
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:47,411
I could really use some new shoes, Man.

109
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,844
I could do whatever you want, ya know?

110
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:53,949
Whatever get you through the night?

111
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:57,089
- I can't take...
- Shut up, shut up!

112
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:02,571
Shut up, okay. I still got my old ones.

113
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:06,761
You get those feet looked at.

114
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:10,872
- And get well soon.
- I will.

115
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:13,737
Thank you, Man.

116
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:15,671
Jesus loves you, Brother.

117
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:17,749
Jesus loves you.

118
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:29,975
<i>Lights out.! Lights out 'til 7 a.m.</i>

119
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,102
Mei, I have bad news.

120
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,399
I heard them talking and...

121
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:00,976
Your mother is gone.

122
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:04,513
She died two weeks ago
in the hospital.

123
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:07,261
They weren't going to tell you.

124
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:12,653
But I'm telling you that you can
pray for her soul to find its way heaven.

125
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:16,330
Please say anything.
If they find-out I told you...

126
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:17,810
I won't say anything.

127
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:19,928
Thank you.

128
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:27,007
<i>Everybody up!
Everything must be cleared by 9 a.m.</i>

129
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:30,845
<i>Please have your I.D.s made by 3:30</i>

130
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:33,577
<i>Please remove all your personal belongings.</i>

131
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:39,806
<i>Everybody up! Let's go! Take your
belongings with you. You know the drill.</i>

132
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:07,600
So, ya wanna tell us what happened.

133
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:13,104
- Someone liked the shoes.
- Funny guy! Do you think this a joke?

134
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:16,538
You know, you guys are outta luck,
crack security squad...

135
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,970
You were right here, you
coulda said somethin'.

136
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,948
But you were too busy sleepin'
off this contraband, right?

137
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:28,504
You come into this shelter again, and I'm gonna
run your raggedy ass back out into the street.

138
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:54,565
Hey! Watch where you're going, Man.

139
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:57,692
I could give you a kick
for that, okay?! Huh?!

140
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:09,503
Four fifty-five.

141
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,144
You got no money,
you gotta get outta line.

142
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:16,491
I got money.

143
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,881
He doesn't have any money,
look at him.

144
00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:23,130
Mister, I told you, if you don't have
money, you have to leave, okay?

145
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:25,586
Get outta line,
people are waiting.

146
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,145
C'mon, Buddy, ya gotta go!

147
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:49,612
- Is this guy givin' ya trouble?
- He's crazy, Officer, get him outta here, okay?

148
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:52,854
All right, c'mon, let's go!
Hey, you! C'mon, let's go!

149
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:54,993
Out! Onto the street!

150
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:59,289
So, Buddy Boy, you want to be a clown, go join
the circus. Not in my precinct, ya hear me?

151
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:01,764
I don't wanna see you around here.
Hey...

152
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:06,115
Jesus Christ!

153
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:08,373
Look what the cat dragged in!

154
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,236
Unbelievable.

155
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:19,260
- Look at him.
- Look at him?

156
00:20:19,777 --> 00:20:21,746
How about the smell?

157
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:24,512
I'll call the boys.

158
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:50,536
Miss us, partner?

159
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:53,743
Welcome back to the force.

160
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:17,767
I'm sorry, I can't let them have you...

161
00:21:18,502 --> 00:21:20,581
Come back.

162
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,474
- How's your day been, Luke?
- Started lousy.

163
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:40,855
But it's lookin' up, isn't it?

164
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:47,853
Luke Wright, the Bit Apple's
hardest cop...once upon a time.

165
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:51,505
Always could take a shot.
But you know what your real talent is?

166
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:53,903
You're a uniter! I mean,
who'd a’ thought that us and

167
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:56,513
the Russkies would ever be on
the same page about anything.

168
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:57,994
Not me!

169
00:21:58,027 --> 00:22:00,411
Nice to see you, Rat! I've
been wantin' to do this

170
00:22:00,412 --> 00:22:02,888
ever since the day you opened
your big, fuckin' mouth.

171
00:22:07,053 --> 00:22:08,971
When we what Docheski did to you...

172
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:11,182
I had to laugh.

173
00:22:11,273 --> 00:22:14,590
We felt bad for Annie,
you know...it was the breaks.

174
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:16,172
She knew who she was with.

175
00:22:16,212 --> 00:22:21,268
When it come up on the street you were back, we couldn't
believe how fuckin' ears. Now, why would you come back?

176
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:25,342
Why wouldn't you disappear somewhere
far away, huh, like the moon?

177
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,132
I missed home.

178
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:34,046
You were one of us, Luke,
we were a team.

179
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:35,402
We're a family.

180
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:38,855
- Then you threw us under the bus.
- We were kings, you sonofabitch.

181
00:22:39,588 --> 00:22:42,645
Now we are a bunch of god damned suckers!

182
00:22:45,488 --> 00:22:47,957
Hey, hey, hey, easy Benoit, huh?

183
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,596
When you come back, we figure you want to die.

184
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,328
Ya know, we got a pool goin' on
when you're gonna end it and how, you know,

185
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,586
Bus, train...

186
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:03,865
I got my money on "Suicide by Cop".

187
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,659
C'mon, take it!

188
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,975
Take a shot. C'mon.

189
00:23:10,582 --> 00:23:12,378
Annie's waiting for you.

190
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:16,350
Question is, do you really
think she wants to see you again.

191
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,686
Actually my real talent
is costin' other people money.

192
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:26,123
You oughta know that, Lasky.

193
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:28,584
You're going to lose that bet.

194
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:33,495
Unless you want to shoot me in the back...
wouldn't be your first time.

195
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,759
What don't you just end it?

196
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:39,735
What are you waiting for?

197
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:42,098
More people around you to die?

198
00:23:44,455 --> 00:23:46,704
What are you waiting for?

199
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,337
For the last time,

200
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:51,989
give me the number.

201
00:24:08,304 --> 00:24:11,731
You're a very brave girl...and clever.

202
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:17,972
But do you know how we knew
exactly what you can do,

203
00:24:18,113 --> 00:24:21,320
- where you're going to be, and when?
- Someone told you that.

204
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:23,452
Right.

205
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:25,923
Can you guess who?

206
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:30,110
Bring her in.

207
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:37,629
Your friend, the one who
told you about your poor mother,

208
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,080
when the scamp who took you from home would not.

209
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:42,983
She's working for us with a smile.

210
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:02,010
<i>Da! In English!</i>

211
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:09,101
I said, speak in English!!

212
00:25:09,223 --> 00:25:10,430
Well?

213
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,873
She won't tell me anything.

214
00:25:18,118 --> 00:25:20,666
My father is a patient man.

215
00:25:21,077 --> 00:25:22,612
I am not.

216
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,852
Tell him what he would know or I'll...

217
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:28,825
N-Y-P-D! Open the door!

218
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:30,835
What the hell?

219
00:25:31,228 --> 00:25:33,677
<i>We got a report of a disturbance.</i>

220
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:40,332
<i>You can make this easy
or you can make it hard.</i>

221
00:25:40,368 --> 00:25:43,256
Open the door or we come in by force.

222
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:48,307
Bullshit, Boo! You come in here you
go out feet first, I swear on my mother.

223
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:55,882
They're in there, Captain. I don't know what the
hell you're lookin' for, they're not cooperating.

224
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:57,905
You better get down here
before things go to hell.

225
00:25:58,313 --> 00:26:00,621
Negative negative. This
is big. I'm goin' back to

226
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:03,465
the Station and monitor the
City. I'll get back to ya.

227
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:06,396
All right, we got her
pined-down, You know what I want.

228
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:07,707
<i>We have a deal.</i>

229
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:10,974
Get the girl, alive if you can...

230
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,334
dead if you can't.

231
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:16,533
<i>We go in, Brooklyn's take goes
up by 10%., that's the new deal.</i>

232
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:18,910
<i>Hold on, I got an incoming call.</i>

233
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:23,585
- Hey, Emile, what's up?
- Take your men off, Boo.

234
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:28,832
Whatever the Chinese offer to you,
I'll up it by 5%.

235
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:34,082
Get her back here!

236
00:26:45,085 --> 00:26:49,261
<i>All right, Quan, I got the Russians
offering-up Brooklyn's take by 7%.</i>

237
00:26:49,297 --> 00:26:51,518
Bronx the same. so,
I don't know what ta tell ya.

238
00:26:51,562 --> 00:26:53,837
I talked to my guys, they're willin'
to go to war over this.

239
00:26:53,874 --> 00:26:57,843
Ya know, you're gonna be stuck between us and the
Russians, like Hitler, fightin' on two fronts, so...

240
00:26:57,977 --> 00:27:00,377
You better think hard about this one.

241
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:03,847
10%. Both precincts.
Final offer.

242
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:18,318
Hey, Mack, both these bastards are willin'
to pay a stiff price for this little Chink girl.

243
00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:20,514
Whatever she's got, I want it.

244
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,668
<i>So, what's our plan?</i>

245
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:24,274
<i>I get the Russians to
drop their guard, you go in.</i>

246
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:29,293
<i>If she catches a bullet, I want you to take-out
every last one of the Bolshevik scumbags.</i>

247
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:32,355
All right, Emile, your offer's good.

248
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:36,009
I'm gonna call my guys off,
only because I like you better!

249
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:39,885
Bullshit!. You're a greedy bastard, Wolf.

250
00:27:39,902 --> 00:27:43,417
You got the scent of something big
and now you want it all for yourself.

251
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:48,823
But I have to tell you something
before you send your men in, guns blazing.

252
00:27:49,661 --> 00:27:50,811
<i>She's gone.</i>

253
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:52,819
What do you mean, she's gone?

254
00:27:53,736 --> 00:27:57,931
<i>She has escaped, and with all
your men out there I can't follow.</i>

255
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,053
<i>I offer you a truce and you will find her.</i>

256
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:06,178
But if the Chinese find her first, that will
be a thing you regret as long as you live.

257
00:28:07,405 --> 00:28:10,513
Docheski, what does she have?

258
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:13,733
<i>Do we have a truce, Captain Wolf?</i>

259
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:19,975
The girl is Chinese, eleven years old girl.
She speaks Mandarin and English.

260
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:26,932
...to find her and bring
her straight to 7th Street.

261
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,424
She's headed for subway.

262
00:29:35,892 --> 00:29:37,200
Sorry, I...

263
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:19,584
<i>She's here!</i>

264
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:47,306
<i>Lost my lock on the Russian's cell on J Street.</i>

265
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:49,906
<i>Sounds like they went into the subway station.</i>

266
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:51,928
<i>Men headin' down.</i>

267
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:43,207
You?

268
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:47,172
- The garbage collector?
- You got bad information.

269
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:50,979
I never collected garbage...
I disposed of it.

270
00:33:55,258 --> 00:33:58,648
Don't lose sleep,
he had it comin'.

271
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,561
You all right?

272
00:34:44,044 --> 00:34:45,846
<i>It's okay.</i>

273
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:22,547
Oh, shit! Hey there, Hon, we're the police.

274
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,333
Everything's all right.

275
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:26,724
Hey, what's your name, Hon?

276
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,673
- This is her.
- I don't know, they all look alike to me.

277
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:33,018
- You got that picture up?
- Yeah, let me see...

278
00:35:41,295 --> 00:35:45,170
In New York City, you don't
see somebody for years...

279
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:48,344
you bump into them twice in the same day.

280
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:53,836
I'm not gonna hurt you, Honey.

281
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:00,420
Police, stop!

282
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:03,002
What the hell did you do, Kid?

283
00:36:20,152 --> 00:36:24,806
A lot of those men who're chasing you are bad.
You wanna tell me why they're after you?

284
00:36:25,776 --> 00:36:26,876
You understand me?

285
00:36:28,878 --> 00:36:30,056
You speak English?

286
00:37:14,294 --> 00:37:17,403
The other way! The cars coming! The other way!

287
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,084
Are you crazy, Man?

288
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,396
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

289
00:37:56,262 --> 00:37:57,195
Hold on.

290
00:38:04,669 --> 00:38:08,436
If this goes on, a lot of innocent
people are gonna get hurt. Want that?

291
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:12,674
Good! Then do what I say.

292
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:27,131
Out of the car! Go get her!

293
00:38:50,446 --> 00:38:51,378
You okay?

294
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:55,813
Let's go.

295
00:38:56,627 --> 00:38:58,214
I'm not five years old.

296
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:03,156
Then keep up!

297
00:39:23,022 --> 00:39:26,640
- You had her and you lost her.
- No, Captain, we didn't lose her.

298
00:39:27,118 --> 00:39:29,745
- She was taken from us by force.
- The Russians?

299
00:39:29,805 --> 00:39:30,821
Not the Russians.

300
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:36,190
- Well...it was Luke Wright.
- What?

301
00:39:36,288 --> 00:39:38,700
- Captain Wolf.
- Not now, Teague!

302
00:39:39,194 --> 00:39:40,718
The mayor wants you, Captain.

303
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:44,482
- Put him through on 2.
- He's not on the phone.

304
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:47,758
He wants you at the Mansion...yesterday!

305
00:39:49,238 --> 00:39:50,456
There ya go.

306
00:39:53,987 --> 00:39:56,201
- Thank you, Mr. Ivanov.
- Thank you.

307
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:10,705
Mr. Ivanov! Here you are, Mr. Ivanov.
Room 1012, Tenth floor.

308
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,049
Thank you.

309
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:33,000
You like a nice hotel?

310
00:40:33,593 --> 00:40:35,526
I've never stayed in a nice hotel.

311
00:40:36,797 --> 00:40:38,666
No one's gonna look for us in one.

312
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:57,500
Man, I don't wanna run a shower.

313
00:40:58,343 --> 00:40:59,875
You could use one.

314
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:06,999
I couldn't just let those
Russians grab you off the train.

315
00:41:10,978 --> 00:41:12,791
Why did you save me?

316
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:18,656
I didn't save you...
you saved me!

317
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:20,968
...pay you back.

318
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:24,235
My name is Luke.

319
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,113
Mei.

320
00:41:31,587 --> 00:41:33,182
Did you have parents, Mei?

321
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,107
- I have a father.
- What's his name?

322
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:40,195
Chin Quong.

323
00:41:44,643 --> 00:41:46,712
We're talking about the same guy.

324
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:49,937
He didn't have any kids last time I checked.

325
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:52,936
Wouldn't make sense, wouldn't be
a day over 3 years old.

326
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,246
I'm adopted.

327
00:41:55,356 --> 00:41:57,005
He get you from back home?

328
00:42:03,196 --> 00:42:04,916
Chan isn't the fatherly type.

329
00:42:05,586 --> 00:42:06,808
Why are you here, Mei?

330
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:09,994
To count.

331
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:21,449
You were over sent by the old guy.
Chan's boss, what's his name.

332
00:42:21,516 --> 00:42:25,153
No computers, no electronic trails,
just what you have in your head, right?

333
00:42:37,895 --> 00:42:40,373
- Do you know Jiao Han?
- I know of him.

334
00:42:41,803 --> 00:42:44,510
He told me a number, a very long number.

335
00:42:44,793 --> 00:42:48,300
I was going someplace for yet
another number and more instructions,

336
00:42:48,336 --> 00:42:50,504
but the Russians came and shot everyone.

337
00:42:50,994 --> 00:42:54,527
<i>Then the police came and I ran away.
Now you know everything.</i>

338
00:42:54,701 --> 00:42:56,468
Happiness for you?

339
00:42:59,633 --> 00:43:01,166
Wanna go back to Han Jiao?

340
00:43:03,103 --> 00:43:05,881
I make too much trouble...
bad business.

341
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,394
After I do what he asks, he kills me...
good business.

342
00:43:09,431 --> 00:43:10,998
So, what about this number?

343
00:43:11,777 --> 00:43:13,718
It’s a long, boring number.

344
00:43:13,755 --> 00:43:15,318
I can tell you.

345
00:43:15,355 --> 00:43:16,736
It wouldn't mean anything to me.

346
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:20,891
How do you know it's one number
and not a bunch of separate numbers?

347
00:43:23,705 --> 00:43:27,730
You're a crazy man..
but not so stupid.

348
00:43:28,531 --> 00:43:30,976
Is there anything interesting
to you about these numbers?

349
00:43:32,115 --> 00:43:34,206
- Maybe a few of them.
- Why?

350
00:43:34,825 --> 00:43:37,551
Because they have a three
or a seven before them.

351
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:42,646
All the numbers are random, but...
five of them has a seven before,

352
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:46,311
and eight of them has a three before.
That's too many times to be random!

353
00:43:47,175 --> 00:43:48,254
It is a code.

354
00:43:49,634 --> 00:43:50,592
What else?

355
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:52,467
Nothing.

356
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:55,644
So, it's the three and the
seven that are interesting

357
00:43:55,646 --> 00:43:57,969
because they happen too
many times to be random?

358
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,668
Because they're not numbers, they're words.

359
00:44:02,315 --> 00:44:04,136
Right-left or left-right.

360
00:44:04,783 --> 00:44:05,982
Old school.

361
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,191
A combination to a safe.

362
00:44:19,217 --> 00:44:21,118
In the hotel?

363
00:44:21,155 --> 00:44:22,086
Where?

364
00:44:39,205 --> 00:44:45,196
About five eleven, brown hair, 30's. Probably
came in here less than a few hours ago.

365
00:44:45,232 --> 00:44:48,726
- Sir, we're not allowed to discuss our guests.
- So, he's a guest?

366
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:51,913
- Did he check in?
- I'm sorry, Sir, we...we're not at liberty to...

367
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,983
He was with a Chinese girl,
eleven years old. I'm her father.

368
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,778
- And I'm very worried about her.
- I'm so sorry, um...

369
00:44:59,128 --> 00:45:01,274
I...I can call the police for you...

370
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:03,471
Do that and I blow your brains out.

371
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:07,450
Now! What room is he in?

372
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,013
What room?

373
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:17,454
- I think...maybe I put him on the tenth floor.
- What room?

374
00:45:18,906 --> 00:45:22,214
- I swear, he didn't have a little girl with him.
- Room.

375
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:25,381
- I just need to check.
- Then check quick,

376
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:28,009
- or I put a bullet in your brain...
Quick!!

377
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,020
Get your hand up!

378
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:34,685
- You don't want any part of this.
- Hands up so I can see 'em.

379
00:45:49,661 --> 00:45:50,952
No one leaves the hotel.

380
00:45:53,824 --> 00:45:56,532
Ten twelve.
He's in room ten twelve.

381
00:45:56,569 --> 00:45:58,527
I thought you said no one
would look for us here!

382
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:03,659
- It's off, I turn it off, no one can call,
- It doesn't need to be on.

383
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:07,980
Get back! Back! Get down on the floor!

384
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,985
Everybody back!

385
00:46:15,345 --> 00:46:19,085
Write down the numbers! Just the ones
with the 3 and the 7 in front...quick!

386
00:46:20,593 --> 00:46:22,248
You! Get over there!

387
00:46:25,148 --> 00:46:26,579
Stay down, stay down.

388
00:46:27,022 --> 00:46:30,786
I'll try to get you someplace safe. If we get
separated, don't tell them you told me anything!

389
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:34,354
- Mei, if they try to scare you...
- Try? I'm so scared already!

390
00:46:34,387 --> 00:46:37,746
- Yeah, me, too. Remember, lie!
- We're almost there.

391
00:46:37,886 --> 00:46:40,256
If you see them downstairs,
try not to kill the girl.

392
00:46:48,562 --> 00:46:49,535
Back inside.

393
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,089
Follow them! I'm going
back down and cut them off!

394
00:47:35,203 --> 00:47:39,300
The cops are here. Hold them off 'til I
give the word! Do not let them in!

395
00:48:08,446 --> 00:48:10,885
Everybody stay down.
You ain't goin' nowhere.

396
00:48:11,337 --> 00:48:15,009
Hey! Where ya going? Step back!
Stop! Down! Get back!

397
00:48:15,322 --> 00:48:16,468
Whoa!

398
00:49:12,806 --> 00:49:16,593
<i>Get up! Everybody up!
We're getting out of the hotel.</i>

399
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:18,547
<i>Up!!</i>

400
00:49:20,526 --> 00:49:21,647
<i>Up!</i>

401
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:28,415
Don't move!

402
00:49:29,144 --> 00:49:30,114
<i>Don't move!</i>

403
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:46,106
Exit this way and keep moving!
Anyone who doesn't, dies...like this!

404
00:49:52,733 --> 00:49:54,478
Hold your fire!

405
00:50:19,796 --> 00:50:21,551
Hey! Stop right there!

406
00:50:27,669 --> 00:50:30,564
Drive, drive!

407
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:52,797
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

408
00:50:56,675 --> 00:51:00,101
My car! Do something!
He took my fuckin' car.

409
00:51:14,259 --> 00:51:16,180
Head Downtown,
I'll give you the address in a minute.

410
00:51:33,217 --> 00:51:35,198
Shit!

411
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:46,409
<i>- Hey, Buddy! You wanna give me address?
- Wait a minute, just hold on.</i>

412
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,951
He's here...Luke Wright is back in the City.

413
00:53:09,278 --> 00:53:11,647
- In my city.
- Actually, he's been back for a while.

414
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:14,289
- A while? What's a while?
- Maybe a year.

415
00:53:14,322 --> 00:53:16,521
Turn that god damned thing off!

416
00:53:23,615 --> 00:53:26,814
What's going on, Wolf? And how is
Luke Wright involved in it?

417
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,831
I figured I might ask you the same question.

418
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,826
Don't try to game me!

419
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,319
You're not even a pawn...

420
00:53:33,564 --> 00:53:37,681
playing on a board so big you can't even
see the edge, that's all you've ever been.

421
00:53:38,134 --> 00:53:41,767
I knew about Luke Wright. Which is more
than you can say until five minutes ago.

422
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:48,540
What you know about Luke Wright rates
less than a paragraph in a very fat book.

423
00:53:48,681 --> 00:53:53,292
After the towers fell, when our manpower
was spread-out tracking terrorist activities,

424
00:53:53,328 --> 00:53:57,420
I was the one who formed a special task force
to deal with the crime that was filling the gap,

425
00:53:57,457 --> 00:54:00,974
and don't you ever fuckin' forget
that I'm the one that put YOU in charge!

426
00:54:01,011 --> 00:54:04,782
- I never forget...my work made you Mayor.
- Your work?

427
00:54:05,614 --> 00:54:07,890
You think Luke was just one of your cops?

428
00:54:08,135 --> 00:54:12,702
When I put together your team, I knew I needed
an edge no ordinary detectives could give me.

429
00:54:13,331 --> 00:54:14,695
Something "surgical".

430
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:20,495
I called friends in places buried so deep they
don't officially exist. They were sympathetic.

431
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,481
A week later they send Luke Wright.

432
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:28,818
Those wise-guys who vanished over the last seven
years? You think that was an internecine war?

433
00:54:29,786 --> 00:54:33,666
Those cocaines you found in the gutter
in Harlem, Freddy Petrovich in Brooklyn...

434
00:54:33,702 --> 00:54:35,627
Tommy Lau in Chinatown.

435
00:54:35,664 --> 00:54:37,484
Luke Wright is a ghost.

436
00:54:38,596 --> 00:54:40,219
Very deadly ghost.

437
00:54:41,951 --> 00:54:43,977
And it worked like a charm, too.

438
00:54:45,029 --> 00:54:48,679
Then you dicks had to get
greedy and pad your pockets.

439
00:54:48,715 --> 00:54:51,525
Luke's a killer,
but he's an honest one.

440
00:54:51,978 --> 00:54:54,437
When he threatened to take
the whole thing to I.A.,

441
00:54:55,165 --> 00:54:59,565
it took some people with a lot of brown
stuck to their pajamas to talk him off the ledge.

442
00:54:59,601 --> 00:55:01,981
If my team gets dismantled,
we're P.I.s again.

443
00:55:02,018 --> 00:55:06,571
But if Luke Wright's so connected how does he end
up in Jersey cage fightin' on the B circuit?

444
00:55:07,492 --> 00:55:08,938
Do I look as a psychiatrist?

445
00:55:09,919 --> 00:55:11,329
Get everybody on this.

446
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:16,398
Once Luke Wright gets on a roll, only one man
in this City can take him on one to one.

447
00:55:16,434 --> 00:55:21,746
Excuse me, I know this is a closed door, but there
was just a major gun battle downtown at a hotel.

448
00:55:21,783 --> 00:55:24,048
The media's going nuts, you're
gonna need to make a statement.

449
00:55:25,508 --> 00:55:28,206
Han Jiao is in the city also.

450
00:55:28,347 --> 00:55:31,564
He gave this little Chinese
something, I don't know what.

451
00:55:32,226 --> 00:55:34,197
- Luke Wright grabbed her before I could.
- What?

452
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,887
- I said Luke...
- Yeah, yeah.

453
00:55:36,564 --> 00:55:37,678
I heard ya the first time.

454
00:55:42,146 --> 00:55:46,146
Close every exit out of Manhattan, make sure
that neither Wright or the girl gets away.

455
00:55:46,183 --> 00:55:48,371
You get commission,
let 'em go,

456
00:55:49,601 --> 00:55:51,500
you'll need a shovel to dig your own grave.

457
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,583
That girl is not leaving this City.

458
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:08,554
We recovered the girl, but the
information might have been compromised.

459
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:10,170
Should we change our time frame?

460
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:13,166
<i>Impossible, now that the whole
damned thing has gone supernova,</i>

461
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:15,102
<i>what's gonna happen is
gonna happen tonight.</i>

462
00:57:15,706 --> 00:57:18,234
- The meeting-place needs to be changed.
- Where to?

463
00:57:19,051 --> 00:57:20,282
I'll let you know.

464
00:57:20,283 --> 00:57:21,849
Here! Right here!

465
00:57:27,961 --> 00:57:29,064
Slow down.

466
00:57:30,557 --> 00:57:34,051
<i>Naw, naw, you don't bring
no hookers in my cab, Man.</i>

467
00:57:35,236 --> 00:57:36,705
<i>Just keep the meter running.</i>

468
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:42,574
Ladies...

469
00:57:53,325 --> 00:57:54,432
<i>Good evening.</i>

470
00:57:56,037 --> 00:57:58,982
<i>- Name?
- We don't have a reservation.</i>

471
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,404
It's full tonight, but we should
be able to find you a place.

472
00:58:03,498 --> 00:58:07,140
<i>- Get out! Take a walk!
- We have tables downstairs,</i>

473
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:12,406
<i>We can sit upstairs, if you like.</i>

474
00:58:20,985 --> 00:58:23,030
<i>Sir, do you have a preference?</i>

475
00:58:23,483 --> 00:58:24,327
<i>Sir?</i>

476
00:58:24,364 --> 00:58:26,157
We'll just get a drink at the bar.

477
00:58:29,404 --> 00:58:31,689
I want you to give me a kiss and
then lie and walk out of here.

478
00:58:32,002 --> 00:58:32,541
But...

479
00:58:32,573 --> 00:58:36,207
Tell 'em you forgot something outside...
but you don't come back!

480
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:50,958
Give me a White Russian, please.

481
00:59:31,886 --> 00:59:34,475
What does he drive
and where is it parked?

482
00:59:37,399 --> 00:59:40,201
A silver SUV in the alley outside.

483
00:59:53,348 --> 00:59:54,572
Vassily.

484
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:56,341
<i>Not even close.</i>

485
00:59:58,005 --> 00:59:58,769
Who is this?

486
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:01,072
<i>The guy who's been
killing your boys all night.</i>

487
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,346
The guy who has your son
tied up in a very dark place.

488
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:06,422
Now, here's what I want...

489
01:00:06,423 --> 01:00:08,430
<i>Do you think I give a
shit about what you want?</i>

490
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:12,700
Do you think you can blackmail me because
you have Vassily? Kill him and go to hell!

491
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:14,481
Oh, I'm goin' to hell, all right.

492
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,626
But I'm not going to kill your boy...
I keep him around.

493
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,228
<i>Like a pet.</i>

494
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:21,580
A badly we treat a pet.

495
01:00:22,211 --> 01:00:25,589
I'm going to do things to him that'll make
him ashamed to look in the mirror afterward.

496
01:00:25,815 --> 01:00:27,619
But I will do them.

497
01:00:27,852 --> 01:00:30,894
<i>Vassily's gonna tell everything
he knows about your operation.</i>

498
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:34,264
And then what you going to do?
Tell the police?

499
01:00:35,101 --> 01:00:38,281
- You want me to laugh?
- Who said anything about the police?

500
01:00:38,681 --> 01:00:42,281
I'm gonna share the information with the
competition, the ones I haven't already killed.

501
01:00:42,329 --> 01:00:45,178
Anything that'll take from you, I will.

502
01:00:45,386 --> 01:00:47,828
First I want to take your trophy wife.

503
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,099
Then I'm gonna take your trophy children.

504
01:00:51,863 --> 01:00:53,911
I'm going to leave you with nothing.

505
01:00:54,173 --> 01:00:57,016
When I'm done, you won't
even be a memory of a memory.

506
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:59,413
But that doesn't have to happen.

507
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,264
What do you want?

508
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,335
- I want to know what's in the safe.
- What safe?

509
01:01:04,376 --> 01:01:07,577
The safe the girl gave me
the combination to, that safe.

510
01:01:09,355 --> 01:01:11,761
30 million dollars.

511
01:01:13,063 --> 01:01:16,874
The kid was on her way to get a second number,
what's in the second safe?

512
01:01:17,129 --> 01:01:20,976
Something worth 30 million dollars.

513
01:01:21,161 --> 01:01:22,345
<i>To who?</i>

514
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:23,820
No idea.

515
01:01:24,591 --> 01:01:27,268
That's 'cause you're only half-smart, Emile.

516
01:01:28,895 --> 01:01:30,749
So, here's the deal...

517
01:01:31,193 --> 01:01:34,003
You tell me where the first safe is,
I take the money and let your boy go.

518
01:01:34,067 --> 01:01:36,847
Lie to me and your world ends...
you have my word on that.

519
01:01:36,858 --> 01:01:40,681
Idiot! I know when
a man is working alone.

520
01:01:41,207 --> 01:01:43,520
And you're as alone as one can be.

521
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:46,979
You need a small army
to get near that safe!

522
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:51,262
- The kind of army I have.
- Had!

523
01:01:51,702 --> 01:01:53,809
It's been shrinking by the minute.

524
01:01:54,735 --> 01:01:57,853
Last chance before I hang up
and go to work on your son.

525
01:02:01,797 --> 01:02:03,901
You going to kill me, Garbageman?

526
01:02:06,146 --> 01:02:08,821
You could have taken us out
that day, couldn't you?

527
01:02:09,296 --> 01:02:10,898
But you just sat there.

528
01:02:11,217 --> 01:02:13,621
Let us ruin you,
let us make you nothing.

529
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:18,649
I guess finding out about that safe gave
you new motivation, eh, Garbageman?

530
01:02:19,326 --> 01:02:22,105
I wouldn't spend my time
talking if I were you...

531
01:02:22,624 --> 01:02:24,312
I'd spend it praying:

532
01:02:24,731 --> 01:02:27,573
when this is over, that
little girl's still alive.

533
01:02:30,836 --> 01:02:32,210
Pray!

534
01:02:41,547 --> 01:02:42,497
When and where?

535
01:02:42,498 --> 01:02:45,744
<i>The underpass, under
the bridge, one hour.</i>

536
01:02:49,419 --> 01:02:51,310
Sorry I pointed a gun at you...

537
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:52,955
when the Russians attacked us.

538
01:02:54,594 --> 01:02:56,495
- It was...
- Business...I know.

539
01:02:56,531 --> 01:02:58,800
Good! That's good! You understand.

540
01:02:59,132 --> 01:03:03,995
We'll get this done and you'll be
safe with me and Uncle Han.

541
01:03:05,368 --> 01:03:09,683
I promise to be a better father to you
than the one who left you and your mother.

542
01:03:12,879 --> 01:03:16,110
There's no one in the world
who cares more about you.

543
01:03:16,911 --> 01:03:18,865
You know that, don't you?

544
01:03:48,512 --> 01:03:50,318
The gang's all here.

545
01:03:50,985 --> 01:03:52,632
Almost.

546
01:03:52,883 --> 01:03:56,400
- Bernie get to call in sick?
- He's in the hospital, Dickhead!

547
01:03:56,426 --> 01:03:59,695
- You broke his trachea.
- I didn't know a trachea could break.

548
01:04:00,394 --> 01:04:02,860
- Hope they can fix it.
- Yeah! How about I fix you, you...

549
01:04:02,861 --> 01:04:05,758
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Not here!

550
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:07,618
Been a while, Luke.

551
01:04:08,497 --> 01:04:10,113
Can't say I missed ya.

552
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:13,260
So, let's get down to business.

553
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,530
Do you really want your hands full?

554
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,575
Scotch's, where else.

555
01:04:40,356 --> 01:04:42,314
That's good!

556
01:04:55,481 --> 01:04:57,843
I've been in restaurants all night.

557
01:04:58,564 --> 01:05:00,630
And all I was served was lead.

558
01:05:06,497 --> 01:05:07,734
Anyone got a light?

559
01:05:07,854 --> 01:05:12,485
You know what, screw this! Look, Captain,
you asked us to come here so we came.

560
01:05:12,596 --> 01:05:15,322
but I ain't gonna sit here and
listen to this scumbag's big mouth...

561
01:05:15,376 --> 01:05:16,964
Shut up, Kolfax!

562
01:05:17,906 --> 01:05:19,872
Still haven't quit, huh?

563
01:05:32,866 --> 01:05:33,666
What the hell is that?

564
01:05:33,867 --> 01:05:36,187
The combination for the safe
with 30 million bucks in it.

565
01:05:36,467 --> 01:05:38,520
- Whoa, whoa! What the hell?
- You big piece of shit,

566
01:05:38,551 --> 01:05:40,682
so the only place it exists now is in here.

567
01:05:41,728 --> 01:05:44,288
Remember that next time your
trigger finger gets a little itchy.

568
01:05:44,325 --> 01:05:48,535
Why would Han Jiao stash it right in the
middle of Chinatown's busiest gambling den?

569
01:05:48,803 --> 01:05:53,747
Because of sleaze bucket cops like you, Benoit,
who collect off of Chinatown's busiest gambling den.

570
01:05:54,141 --> 01:05:57,902
Where else would you surround with a
dozen armed men without a trace of his intention?

571
01:05:58,007 --> 01:06:00,594
Captain, how do we know this
sonofabitch is on the level, huh?

572
01:06:00,595 --> 01:06:03,640
He's a bum? Where are you
gettin' your information?

573
01:06:04,856 --> 01:06:06,652
There's an exchange happening tonight.

574
01:06:06,687 --> 01:06:09,125
That's why half of the deal isn't
safe in the casino.

575
01:06:09,225 --> 01:06:11,440
Only I couldn't get to it
on my own, so I called on you,

576
01:06:11,665 --> 01:06:12,908
My old pals.

577
01:06:14,305 --> 01:06:17,452
30 million dollars split six
ways is still a lot of money.

578
01:06:19,697 --> 01:06:21,527
We're riskin' a lot, Captain.

579
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:25,890
You especially. Everybody knows
ya got a bright future.

580
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:27,627
Promised by who?

581
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:29,112
His Honor?

582
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:32,380
Take it easy, he's teasin' ya, Wolf.

583
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,876
He's goin' to let you on the
street knowing what you know now?

584
01:06:34,877 --> 01:06:36,028
Hey! What's that supposed to mean?

585
01:06:36,064 --> 01:06:37,995
Meaning, his second term
has now come to an end.

586
01:06:37,996 --> 01:06:41,226
His hold over the City goes POOF!
Just like that, he's Joe Citizen again.

587
01:06:41,755 --> 01:06:44,129
30 million would be a nice retirement package.

588
01:06:44,436 --> 01:06:45,838
What's he givin' the Chinks?

589
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:49,398
If I knew that, I wouldn't be standing
here with you assholes, would I?

590
01:06:51,081 --> 01:06:52,527
Bright future, huh?

591
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:54,112
Big headlines:

592
01:06:54,981 --> 01:06:58,702
"Hero cops take down New York City's
biggest underground gambling operation."

593
01:06:58,738 --> 01:07:00,193
5 million bucks a piece.

594
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:03,753
No one will ever know about this...
to give it that extra sweet taste.

595
01:07:21,962 --> 01:07:23,422
All right, who's been in there?

596
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,533
- For Christ sake, who's been in there?
- I..Me, Cap.

597
01:07:27,568 --> 01:07:31,297
You two, you're on point, place is packed
with civilians. so exercise some judgment.

598
01:07:31,405 --> 01:07:33,273
Remember I got the combination.

599
01:07:33,876 --> 01:07:35,925
You want that money, watch my back.

600
01:07:53,062 --> 01:07:54,531
Where are you going?

601
01:08:31,414 --> 01:08:32,492
Shut it down!

602
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:34,603
Cheers!

603
01:08:45,235 --> 01:08:46,833
This way! Go!

604
01:09:40,082 --> 01:09:41,381
Go!.

605
01:09:53,454 --> 01:09:55,598
Take him out!

606
01:10:02,082 --> 01:10:03,574
Cover me!

607
01:10:46,465 --> 01:10:48,583
Owen! Take it!

608
01:10:49,105 --> 01:10:51,289
Oh, God! I'm hit!

609
01:11:11,006 --> 01:11:13,549
Aw, shit! I gotta get outta here.

610
01:11:14,819 --> 01:11:15,926
Ah! Captain!

611
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:22,041
God, you shit! You shot a man
in the back, you sonofabitch!

612
01:11:23,093 --> 01:11:25,918
- All right, Mears, where are we going?
- This way.

613
01:11:26,998 --> 01:11:27,924
Move!

614
01:12:09,043 --> 01:12:12,706
- It's locked and bolted to sinners like us.
- Well, let's not wait for an interview.

615
01:12:36,855 --> 01:12:39,492
All right, you bastard, get started.

616
01:12:47,859 --> 01:12:49,616
Here's how we do this:

617
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:53,244
You put down your guns,
I open the safe.

618
01:12:54,711 --> 01:12:56,142
You wanna shoot me,
go ahead.

619
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:59,472
Make your minds up quick, 'cause
the real cops'll be here soon.

620
01:13:03,923 --> 01:13:05,087
On the floor!

621
01:13:40,002 --> 01:13:41,631
C'mon, you sonofabitch,
what are you trying to pull?

622
01:13:41,632 --> 01:13:43,334
They're right-left switched!

623
01:13:43,371 --> 01:13:44,815
It's gonna open.

624
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,720
You'll live.

625
01:14:06,521 --> 01:14:07,857
Left 26.

626
01:14:25,109 --> 01:14:27,057
Captain Wolf, what the
hell happened in here?

627
01:14:27,058 --> 01:14:29,816
What do you think happened, huh?
We had a raid on the place go bad!

628
01:14:29,852 --> 01:14:32,282
We got dead cops! Casualties!
Get it there, will ya!

629
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,254
Captain Wolf, you need an ambulance!

630
01:14:33,255 --> 01:14:35,015
I need a fleet of
ambulances, all right.

631
01:14:35,016 --> 01:14:37,490
Call it in, will ya! I'll drive
my own busted ass to the hospital.

632
01:14:40,974 --> 01:14:45,683
Not bad. If you weren't such a double-dealing
asshole, I could almost like you.

633
01:14:46,033 --> 01:14:48,045
Almost! Drive!

634
01:14:52,591 --> 01:14:53,915
It's a scratch.

635
01:14:57,723 --> 01:14:59,104
I'm not gonna kill ya.

636
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:01,660
But I didn't say I was
putting you up at the Ritz.

637
01:15:10,153 --> 01:15:11,232
Hello?

638
01:15:11,581 --> 01:15:13,671
I need money, Danny.

639
01:15:15,927 --> 01:15:16,797
What?

640
01:15:20,241 --> 01:15:23,856
Thirty million! Five thousand in
one thousand dollar bills.

641
01:15:24,096 --> 01:15:24,796
<i>I want it so..</i>

642
01:15:24,797 --> 01:15:28,326
No! No! What you want to do is
calm down so we can talk like adults.

643
01:15:28,435 --> 01:15:33,640
<i>Shut it down! I want to talk. But I don't wanna
talk to you, I wanna talk to your boyfriend.</i>

644
01:15:37,899 --> 01:15:39,262
This is Alex.

645
01:15:39,499 --> 01:15:41,245
It's been a while, Alex.

646
01:15:42,526 --> 01:15:44,027
How do you get this number?

647
01:15:44,028 --> 01:15:47,195
C'mon, Alex! Reach up the
Mayor's ass, and there you are.

648
01:15:49,443 --> 01:15:52,217
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do, huh?

649
01:15:52,253 --> 01:15:54,559
Betty's a better catch than Annie was, anyway.

650
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:57,339
<i>I never understood how you
hooked-up with a cow like that.</i>

651
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:01,096
It was never about her looks,
it was her sense of humor.

652
01:16:01,448 --> 01:16:02,987
She's not so funny now, is she?

653
01:16:03,032 --> 01:16:06,004
No, she's not, and neither am I.

654
01:16:07,099 --> 01:16:11,536
I have the money, Alex. I had to kill
a lot of people to get it, so listen up.

655
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:16,176
We haven't made the combination exchange yet.
What's in the other safe?

656
01:16:17,248 --> 01:16:18,473
A disc.

657
01:16:19,165 --> 01:16:20,891
Names, money trails...

658
01:16:21,965 --> 01:16:25,130
When our commanders sent the two of us
to help Danny to clean up the City

659
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:28,004
they attached a price.
In exchange, Danny looked the other way.

660
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,947
while the assets seized
from every group deemed

661
01:16:29,948 --> 01:16:33,310
a terrorist organization were
funneled into their private accounts.

662
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:36,871
It's amazing that you people let you get away when
they're scared and want to feel protected, huh?

663
01:16:36,908 --> 01:16:40,413
Amazing how many scumbags go outta
their way to take advantage of 'em.

664
01:16:40,653 --> 01:16:42,008
- Like you did?
- I quit!

665
01:16:42,063 --> 01:16:44,099
You think that helps all
those souls you sent to meet

666
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,026
their Maker without due process
rest a whole lot easier?

667
01:16:47,063 --> 01:16:51,229
You thought you could atone by climbing into a
cage and allowing yourself to get beaten to a pulp.

668
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:53,376
<i>Don't fucking preach at me, Luke!</i>

669
01:16:53,377 --> 01:16:56,186
I'm getting paid for services rendered.

670
01:16:57,163 --> 01:17:00,954
<i>You sold the disc to the Chinese
so they could blackmail and rolf Han Jiao.</i>

671
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:04,218
<i>Take the 30 mil and waltz off
with Danny to a villa in the Bahamas.</i>

672
01:17:05,064 --> 01:17:07,048
<i>Bali, but whatever, right?</i>

673
01:17:07,471 --> 01:17:11,873
<i>- So, now you know. Now what?
- Now you pay.</i>

674
01:17:12,236 --> 01:17:13,992
All right, I'm turning around.

675
01:17:14,293 --> 01:17:15,172
<i>No you're not.</i>

676
01:17:16,601 --> 01:17:18,010
What are you talking about?

677
01:17:18,624 --> 01:17:20,963
<i>You got the money, the Chinese
have nothing you care about.</i>

678
01:17:20,999 --> 01:17:23,626
No, they have something I did.

679
01:17:41,988 --> 01:17:45,677
Give the girl the combination to your
safe and she will give you our number.

680
01:17:45,922 --> 01:17:48,828
We go to your location, you go to ours,
we we've gotten the disc,

681
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,448
we will explain the code,

682
01:17:51,621 --> 01:17:52,860
and you get the cash.

683
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:54,453
That's the deal.

684
01:17:55,569 --> 01:17:58,847
- Let's hear it.
- It's a very long number.

685
01:17:58,942 --> 01:18:00,773
You want to write it down.

686
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,530
Thank goodness I brought a pen, huh?

687
01:18:14,087 --> 01:18:15,334
You might want to close your eyes.

688
01:18:18,315 --> 01:18:19,656
Have it your way.

689
01:18:32,221 --> 01:18:33,775
C'mon, Luke.

690
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:38,351
The old place...
just you and me.

691
01:18:41,131 --> 01:18:42,823
Are you a friend of Luke?

692
01:18:45,403 --> 01:18:47,249
Not as far as your concerned.

693
01:18:59,507 --> 01:19:02,948
Violence that has rocked the City tonight
continued in a bloody gun battle

694
01:19:03,049 --> 01:19:06,325
in a Chinatown nightclub
less than an hour ago.

695
01:19:06,362 --> 01:19:10,134
- This is really gettin' out of hand.
- Ya think? Thanks for that insight.

696
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:14,856
Your Honor, Alex Rosen's on your
private line, he says that it's urgent.

697
01:19:16,173 --> 01:19:16,975
<i>Excuse me, Your Honor...</i>

698
01:19:16,976 --> 01:19:19,285
I'll be back in five,
don't bother me now.

699
01:19:19,738 --> 01:19:21,467
<i>Why didn't he call me on my cell phone?</i>

700
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,985
I thought I told you to
put all my calls through to the...

701
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:28,501
I always told you this place
had a lousy security standards.

702
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,802
Yeah, that's because nobody's been crazy enough
come in here and pull a stunt like this.

703
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:37,043
- You got some balls, Luke.
- Yeah! Amazing that I can even walk.

704
01:19:38,066 --> 01:19:38,932
The disc.

705
01:19:39,611 --> 01:19:41,993
What? Think I'm stupid enough
to let a gang of Chinese

706
01:19:41,994 --> 01:19:44,865
walk up the front steps and collect
it from me in my living room?

707
01:19:45,002 --> 01:19:48,420
- It's in a safe far away from here.
- No, I don't think you're stupid.

708
01:19:48,578 --> 01:19:51,311
Which is why I don't for a second
believe he'd give you the only copy.

709
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:53,464
I going to meet Alex.

710
01:19:54,301 --> 01:19:55,474
First you're gonna give me the disc,

711
01:19:56,048 --> 01:19:57,932
or I'll put the bullets in
places that won't kill ya

712
01:19:57,934 --> 01:20:00,064
but it'll make you spend the
rest of your life wishing I had.

713
01:20:08,983 --> 01:20:13,628
- Satisfied?
- I want to make sure it's not Elvis' Greatest Hits.

714
01:20:23,502 --> 01:20:25,778
Alex will kill you, you know.

715
01:20:26,244 --> 01:20:27,438
Yeah, probably.

716
01:21:14,765 --> 01:21:16,755
Luke, you look like hell.

717
01:21:17,891 --> 01:21:19,181
Just alcohol.

718
01:21:20,452 --> 01:21:22,552
Lack of sunlight, sleep deprivation.

719
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:25,875
Other than that I feel great.

720
01:21:28,209 --> 01:21:32,378
Yeah, I was thinking, how many bodies
are we dumpin' in this place, huh?

721
01:21:34,542 --> 01:21:36,290
You know, I didn't keep count.

722
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:39,521
They're all assholes though, right?

723
01:21:44,347 --> 01:21:45,686
Let'r go, Alex.

724
01:21:46,928 --> 01:21:47,977
Danny called.

725
01:21:48,713 --> 01:21:50,339
Told me about your visit.

726
01:21:51,548 --> 01:21:54,930
I have to admit, even I
didn't see that one coming.

727
01:21:56,152 --> 01:21:58,504
You have the disc and the money.

728
01:22:01,898 --> 01:22:03,295
What is she to you?

729
01:22:06,666 --> 01:22:07,765
Life.

730
01:22:09,703 --> 01:22:12,644
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.

731
01:22:13,452 --> 01:22:16,322
'Cause she's the reason that
yours is gonna be a whole lot shorter.

732
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,669
Money, Luke.

733
01:22:20,344 --> 01:22:21,494
In the car...

734
01:22:25,349 --> 01:22:26,981
or in a bank,

735
01:22:29,921 --> 01:22:34,895
or a series of lockers at Grand Central,
or maybe I donated it to charity,

736
01:22:35,194 --> 01:22:36,949
goodness of my heart.

737
01:22:39,304 --> 01:22:42,290
Gonna find out where the money is
you're gonna have to do it the hard way.

738
01:23:38,588 --> 01:23:39,951
You all right, Mei?

739
01:23:41,491 --> 01:23:45,679
I saw him fight before...
bad business for you.

740
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:48,319
Worse.

741
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:51,406
You saved me.

742
01:23:52,094 --> 01:23:53,151
Again.

743
01:23:54,403 --> 01:23:55,826
We saved each other.

744
01:24:01,384 --> 01:24:03,215
I know how you feel.

745
01:24:03,335 --> 01:24:06,001
Help me get this sack
of garbage outta the car.

746
01:24:08,035 --> 01:24:10,005
He gets to his daddy's things now.

747
01:24:13,686 --> 01:24:14,778
50 grand.

748
01:24:15,959 --> 01:24:20,148
For your trouble. I don't see how much
of it you're gonna live to enjoy it.

749
01:24:20,397 --> 01:24:23,993
You wanted him safe and sound
after what he did to you?

750
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,900
For her sake.

751
01:24:31,992 --> 01:24:34,052
We meet again, all bets are off!

752
01:25:22,133 --> 01:25:24,753
- Watch where you're fuckin' goin', Man!
- Keep walkin'!

753
01:25:24,789 --> 01:25:28,698
Excuse me? Pardon me? Anything?
This is New York City.

754
01:25:40,592 --> 01:25:42,466
Bank number five, how many more?

755
01:25:42,785 --> 01:25:43,589
That's it!

756
01:25:44,957 --> 01:25:48,132
They're copies of the disc
in security boxes all over the City.

757
01:25:48,211 --> 01:25:51,588
If it comes to us, a lot of important
people are gonna be very sorry.

758
01:25:51,994 --> 01:25:54,604
Our security,
good business for us.

759
01:25:56,427 --> 01:25:57,496
What's now?

760
01:25:58,263 --> 01:25:59,607
Now we get outta town.

761
01:26:01,192 --> 01:26:03,474
Ah, you're a kid...

762
01:26:05,428 --> 01:26:08,848
I'm not sure I could be a good father,
I think that ship has sailed.

763
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:11,435
I don't want no more fathers.

764
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:15,051
Will you be my friend?

765
01:26:16,772 --> 01:26:18,655
'Til my dying day.

766
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:27,185
I got info on a school
for gifted kids up in Seattle.

767
01:26:28,626 --> 01:26:30,010
It's a nice ride.

768
01:26:30,723 --> 01:26:32,411
If you like trees and shit.

769
01:26:34,925 --> 01:26:36,189
Are we safe?

770
01:26:38,003 --> 01:26:39,796
One day at a time, Mei.

771
01:26:40,264 --> 01:26:42,336
One day at a time.
