00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,489
The more jobs we do with these guys...

3
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,940
The more they squeeze us.

4
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,420
Fucking Russians.

5
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,540
Well, Vassili kept things tight,
at least you knew where you were.

6
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,165
But this bitch...

7
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,420
I don't know.

8
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,010
Man, no shit.

9
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,081
I can almost feel her
breathing down our necks.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,729
I'll tell you what though, man.

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,283
This job, it's keeping her up nights.

12
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,205
Yeah. Well, the less we know, the better.

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,005
All right, so what we're talking about,
we're gonna need more bodies.

14
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,567
Franco and Marcus?

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,900
That's our move?

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,729
Well, we could do it ourselves, but...

17
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,460
Inside three minutes?

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,020
No, it's not possible.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,441
Job needs to be done in broad daylight.

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,600
That means civilians, that means terrain.

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,246
We need them.

22
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,087
Don't worry.

23
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,643
I trained with Marcus.

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,969
Ah, shit. Fuck.

25
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,620
Hey, watch the leather, man.

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,980
Yeah.

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,007
So, yeah, these guys,
they can handle themselves. Trust me.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,020
I'm telling you, Mike.
Me and Marcus go way back.

29
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,770
It ain't Marcus I'm worried about.

30
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,460
All right.

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,289
We go in two weeks.

32
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,580
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

33
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,460
I just don't get how you can love
a dog more than a chick is all.

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,540
Well, you got a girlfriend,
now you can talk about women, huh?

35
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,805
Hey, Russell, where did you say your
brother met that girlfriend he has now,

36
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,860
the one he's in love with?

37
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,961
All right.

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,165
I need you all to
tighten it up for me now.

39
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,810
Hey, you heard him.

40
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,331
- Tighten it up.
- All right.

41
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,922
You better be right about this, Mike.

42
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,780
"One day, the czar's
gardener came to report

43
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,884
"that someone had been stealing
the fruits from the garden.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,060
"Determined to catch the thief...

45
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,162
"...the czar ordered his three sons

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,807
"to watch his precious
garden through the night."

47
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,964
"Elizabeth was loved by everyone in town."

48
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,603
Let's make this one for the books, huh?

49
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,730
Here's some paperwork to get it done.

50
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,686
Check them!

51
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,764
Radio check. Check, check. One, two.

52
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,286
We're good.

53
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,606
- We good?
- Yeah.

54
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,607
Down! Everybody down!

55
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,127
Everybody down!

56
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,287
Franco, guy on your left.

57
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,649
What the hell do you think you're doing?

58
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,260
Advise if responding, robbery in progress.

59
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,566
First City National...

60
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,651
Mike, call just went out.

61
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,322
Stand by for responder ETAs.

62
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,100
Hands out where I can see them, cabrón!

63
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,531
You too!

64
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,321
Come on, put your hands out.

65
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,526
Face on the floor!

66
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,887
Don't move!

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,047
Open your mouth.

68
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,401
All right, 512 and 11 responding.

69
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,682
Three en route.
They're getting close, Mike.

70
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,841
Two and a half minutes.

71
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,885
Open it.

72
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,610
ETA is one minute, Mike.

73
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,603
Response is coming from the south.

74
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,962
Working on a game plan. One sec.

75
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm on it!

76
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,410
Don't move!

77
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,860
Everybody in the vault!

78
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,420
Gabe, remember, north on Hill
and east on Ninth.

79
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,009
Copy. North on Hill and east on Ninth.

80
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,361
Go!

81
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,847
Yeah!

82
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,400
That's what I'm talking about!

83
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,641
Yeah!

84
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,808
Okay, you're approaching an intersection.

85
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,208
You've got a window. Take it.

86
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,840
Here. Right here.

87
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,620
Fuck!

88
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,484
Shit. Shit.

89
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,449
Gabe, you're gonna take
the highway entrance ahead.

90
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,847
What the fuck?

91
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,100
Do not let him decelerate, Mike.

92
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,725
Do not let him decelerate.

93
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,080
Take this oncoming lane.

94
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,089
I can't see shit! What fucking lane?

95
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,201
Now!

96
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,260
What the fuck?

97
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,806
No way, no fucking way. I can't get it.

98
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,680
Whoa!

99
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,081
Oh, oh, fuck!

100
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,447
Oh, shit.

101
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,403
I'm cut off behind the collision, Mike.

102
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,860
You're on your own.

103
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,281
Franco, make some noise.
Keep these people back.

104
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,761
Fuck.

105
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,122
Gabe, let's move. Get the box!

106
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,083
- Come on!
- Fuck!

107
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,540
Franco, you've made your point.
Stand down.

108
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,766
Let's go!

109
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,763
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

110
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,761
Shit.

111
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,740
Goddamn stupid bullshit!

112
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like I was planning that shit!

113
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,049
God damn it, Gabe,
you still a fucking amateur.

114
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,161
What the fuck!

115
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,220
Shut up!

116
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,900
The fuck you thinking
you greedy piece of shit?

117
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,048
They put the bait in there
for dumb fucks like you!

118
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,220
Marcus! Put your shit in the trunk, man.

119
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,481
Fuck!

120
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,363
- Bitch!
- Three days.

121
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,845
Unless you hear from me different.

122
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,460
Yeah, you know what? It was a gamble!

123
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,100
But you'd all be blowing me right now
if that shit hadn't been rigged.

124
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,531
- Fuck you!
- And you know it!

125
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,460
Is this a game?

126
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,562
Yo, put it away, Franco.

127
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,050
Franco, man.

128
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,721
You ever point a gun at me again,
you'd be a fool not to use it.

129
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,245
You understand me?

130
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,010
- Copy that.
- Copy that shit.

131
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,086
Go catch some bad guys, detectives.

132
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,565
You pull that shit out there,
what you think's going to happen?

133
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,660
Huh?

134
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,340
What the fuck you think
is going to happen to you?

135
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,646
What?

136
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,328
Can't you see what I'm trying to do here?

137
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,820
- Get off me.
- I ain't gonna get off you, little brother,

138
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,082
because you're going to
end up fucking dead.

139
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,980
You didn't see the same shit
me and Marcus seen.

140
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,128
Fuck, what? Navy SEAL shit again?

141
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,284
Huh?

142
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,530
Mike is pissed.

143
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,764
But Mike's still Mike.

144
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,540
These other two, Marcus and Franco...

145
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,641
Hey.

146
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,442
Do we have to worry about them?

147
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,020
Cops look after cops.

148
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,282
Same as you Special Ops do.

149
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,011
It's fine.

150
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,646
All right.

151
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,807
All right?

152
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,441
Gabe's been clean for six months.

153
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,340
He's trying.

154
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,124
He was a good cop.

155
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,330
Look, I know you give a fuck.

156
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,321
We're family, man. We're family.

157
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,401
God and righteousness will prevail.

158
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,363
Death to the ways of the devil.

159
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,531
All will prevail.

160
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,860
Goodness will prevail.

161
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,460
White devil establishes himself by rape!

162
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,580
That's right.

163
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,365
Murder! Robbing people!

164
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,260
God hates the white devil.

165
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,340
True, brother!

166
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,124
He's the illegal immigrant.

167
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,210
You, sir!

168
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,580
You have the sign of the beast around
your neck like a hangman's noose.

169
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,300
God and righteousness will prevail.

170
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,562
The original man will rise.

171
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,168
He will rise again!

172
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,340
Death to the ways of the devil.

173
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,885
Detective Allen.

174
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,051
Goodness will preval.

175
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,164
Well, they fired a warning shot.

176
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,283
Uh, 12-gauge tactical round.

177
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,060
Run it.

178
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,606
Yeah, we're dealing
with a crash-and-bash, four-man team.

179
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,500
We're pulling surveillance now.

180
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,980
The dye pack destroyed
most of what they took in cash.

181
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,289
But their focus was on
a security deposit box.

182
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,420
Yeah.

183
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,443
- Belonging to who?
- It belonged to

184
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,847
a wealthy Russian named Dimitrije Petkov.

185
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,860
Family claims they have no idea
why he would keep a box here.

186
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,940
That's Walter Sims,
the bank manager right there.

187
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,180
Get me that report.

188
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,520
Walter.

189
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,568
Detective Allen. First time being robbed?

190
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,740
No fun, right?

191
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,380
They've got pictures of my family.

192
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,860
My daughters. Where we live.

193
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,060
My daughters' school.

194
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,340
Walter, you're a bank manager.

195
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,260
You should be smart enough to know
that the monster has gone digital.

196
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,700
Be careful what you
insta-google-tweet-face.

197
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,131
Fucking sons of bitches.

198
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,970
Hey, hey, Walter.

199
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,004
Give 'em hell, baby.

200
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,800
Bye, Daddy.

201
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,660
Everybody, listen the fuck up!

202
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,580
I just found out Captain is still waiting

203
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,445
on a current gang initiation
report from some of you.

204
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,001
- Smith.
- Mmm.

205
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,641
Uh, same as always, Sarge. Um...

206
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,602
They get in a circle and they
kick the shit out of each other.

207
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,420
And then they hug it out.

208
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,568
- Just get it done.
- Sorry, Sarge.

209
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,689
Also, First City downtown
got held up this morning.

210
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,046
Apparently, they were heavily
armed and spoke Spanish,

211
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,900
which narrows it down to just
under a quarter of the city.

212
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,526
Uh, I resent the racial implications
of that remark there, Sarge.

213
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,060
And they all live in your one-room duplex,

214
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,366
so they shouldn't be too hard to find.

215
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,260
Call Marcus's mom. She's at my place.

216
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,020
Ooh!

217
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,043
Make calls, check with our people.

218
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,780
Jeffrey Allen from Major Crimes
will be heading up the investigation.

219
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,020
Speaking of, allow me
to introduce his nephew, Chris.

220
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,700
Where'd you come from again?

221
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,540
Zone Two. Uh, FIT Unit.

222
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,260
Mongrel territory.

223
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,771
Crossing guard.

224
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,460
Two, huh?

225
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,483
Belmont. Pair up with Allen.

226
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,780
Come on, man.

227
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,620
Maybe he can get you
to come to work on time.

228
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,245
Are you serious?

229
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,161
Now remember, first to find
a gun out there gets the day off.

230
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,940
That's all I've got.

231
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,060
Hey, Sarge, can we talk about this?

232
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,400
Hell no.

233
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,090
Get the fuck out of the way, man.

234
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,004
We looking for anything in particular?

235
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,520
Always.

236
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,041
Hey, Shanice, come on down from there now.

237
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,844
Hey, Snap, baby!

238
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,286
You're in trouble now.

239
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,180
Look, I was minding my own
till these motherfuckers showed up.

240
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,860
- Come on down from there.
- I'm just having me a good time.

241
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,962
Come your ass down!

242
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,060
Damn.

243
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,491
How the fuck you got up there?

244
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,380
All right, come on over here, boys.

245
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,860
Come on, man.
Y'all go over there and help.

246
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,540
You better not be watching
my motherfucking ass.

247
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,140
Sources are saying
the brazen robbery may have ties

248
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,380
to cartels and even the Russian mafia.

249
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,007
With more on this, our crime
correspondent, William Moran.

250
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,331
Thought to control 70% of the Russian
economy, the Russian mafia is the...

251
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,401
Huh.

252
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,089
Yeah, listen, uh...
I'm going to call you back.

253
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,845
Yeah, thanks.

254
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,220
How's work? Anything from Marcus?

255
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,845
Quiet as a mother's prayer.

256
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,327
Good. I'll see you guys in two days.

257
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,340
A senior State Department
official was quoted as saying,

258
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,500
"There is not a major Russian organized

259
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,580
"crime figure that we are tracking

260
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,967
"who does not carry an Israeli passport."

261
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,881
Come.

262
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,008
You know how this works.

263
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,567
Take it easy, man. The safety's off.

264
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,046
Oh!

265
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,460
Hello, little man!

266
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,540
Daddy!

267
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,940
How are you doing? All right?

268
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,123
I missed you.

269
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,881
There really is no love quite like
a father's love for his son, no?

270
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,521
Come.

271
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,980
So, you know, Michael,

272
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,220
Vassili will be calling.
We are grateful for your work,

273
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,140
but in this case,
we need to withhold payment.

274
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,208
- There is a second job.
- No!

275
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,642
We done the job. Pay the fucking money!

276
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,220
Mmm.

277
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,560
My sister...

278
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,088
My sister always went for stupid men.

279
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,925
Why? I do not know.

280
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,570
Perhaps it is that my sister,
too, is stupid.

281
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,765
A terrible thing for
a sibling to say, I know.

282
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,340
But she is a great beauty, yes,
which goes a long way in this world,

283
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,091
but look in the eyes and you will see it.

284
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,660
A great yawning stupidity

285
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,491
and a complete and utter
lack of judgment in men.

286
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,340
But love...

287
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,761
Love makes great demands of us all. Hmm?

288
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,921
What do you want?

289
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,282
He's going to be calling again.

290
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,971
Hello, Michael.

291
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,046
Elena.

292
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,889
What's going on here, Irina?
The fucking feds?

293
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,564
What the fuck are you in?

294
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,966
Thank you, Elena.

295
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,128
Yes, I have just been speaking to Michael.

296
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,322
Mmm-hmm, I was just about
to discuss that with him.

297
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,164
This wasn't the fucking deal.

298
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,643
Michael is still resistant
about the second job.

299
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,721
I know this.

300
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,380
The FBI have traced the files.

301
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,484
They are in the possession
of Homeland Security.

302
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,841
Of course not.

303
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,340
Yo, man. We got a problem.

304
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,851
What's that? Irina?

305
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,260
Yeah.

306
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,100
Yeah, we need to meet now. All of us.

307
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,690
They're fucking with us, man.

308
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,580
There's another job they want us to do.

309
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,940
Just ain't no dealing with these people.

310
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,340
Man, we should have cut
those ties years ago, after Iraq.

311
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,408
Guess it's not so clean
when you got a kid in the mix.

312
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,860
I'll call your brother. See you in a few.

313
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,291
Yeah, all right.

314
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,180
...and she's like, "Give me a kiss,
give me a kiss, Daddy."

315
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,380
And I'm like, "Whoa, baby,
look, you're an informant.

316
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,020
"That is against police protocol."

317
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,851
Strictly speaking,
you shouldn't even be sucking my dick.

318
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,300
- Yo.
- What are we doing here, Mike?

319
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,380
- Where's Russell at?
- I don't know, he's your boy.

320
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,084
Put a GPS on his ass.

321
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,089
Yo, Gabe. Where your brother, man?

322
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,251
Don't ask me. He's a no-show.

323
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,220
What are we doing here?

324
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,540
She ain't paying.

325
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,820
Bullshit.

326
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,140
There's another job.

327
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,446
The fuck you talking about?

328
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,820
She says it's worth three mil
on top of what she owes.

329
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,083
Oh. Of course she did.
She didn't pay now, why the fuck pay later?

330
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,368
Bullshit, she's playing you.

331
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,420
- She got what she wanted, right?
- What?

332
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,740
She got what she wanted!

333
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,180
The fuck I got to deal
with this bitch, huh?

334
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,850
You're the one who got us
hooked up with this bullshit.

335
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,020
This come from your end.

336
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,180
- You deal with it.
- Uh-huh.

337
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,520
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

338
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,180
You two are really in it now, Franco.

339
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,460
How you figure?

340
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,925
She got the feds in her pocket, baby.

341
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,340
- Yeah.
- Feds?

342
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,380
I've seen them. They're all
up in there, one big happy family.

343
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,180
And I ain't got to
remind either one of you

344
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,726
how much the feds love dirty fucking cops.

345
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,963
Look who decided to show up.

346
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,486
Check the side!

347
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,285
Russell!

348
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,323
- Back up! Back up!
- Get it off! Get it off!

349
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,940
Get him out of here!

350
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,166
Get off me!

351
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,140
Get him out, Michael.
Come on. Get him out.

352
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,004
No, his hands are tied. I can't get him.

353
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,685
Get him out the car, Mike.

354
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,681
All right.

355
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,327
Oh, shit!

356
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,371
How's it look?

357
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,160
It ain't good, man.

358
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,365
He ain't gonna make it.

359
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,040
Russell.

360
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,885
I'm going to take care of you now.

361
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,161
Go on.

362
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,529
Don't look at it.

363
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,681
Fuck!

364
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,761
Oh.

365
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,764
It's Michael again.

366
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,601
I know.

367
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,526
You know?

368
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,767
Here.

369
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,523
He's not calling for me.

370
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,484
I'm going to bed.

371
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,288
My, what big teeth you've got.

372
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,700
Some guy used this in a robbery
a couple nights ago.

373
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,165
Ingenious.

374
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,482
Hit the lights, panda bear.

375
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,220
So, we agree the whole
Spanish-speaking thing is bullshit.

376
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,448
No way these guys are Cartel.

377
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,921
Tell me if you notice anything.

378
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,325
Well, this isn't street.

379
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,161
These guys have had tactical training.

380
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,325
Some of these guys are military for sure.

381
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,361
The czarina, what's she after?

382
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,001
Psst.

383
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,364
She ain't said yet.

384
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,642
Whatever it is, it's in an unmarked
Homeland Security building.

385
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,851
DHS uses it as a weigh station
for sensitive materials

386
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,684
coming in and out of the country.

387
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,220
How many guards?

388
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,321
Unknown.

389
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,689
Unknown. Probably a lot.

390
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,008
Definitely some private tactical teams.

391
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,260
Some kind of rent-a-SWAT.

392
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,220
So what are we talking?
Four maybe five minutes tops?

393
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,731
No, man. No.

394
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,211
We're looking at 10.

395
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,166
Uh, yeah, that can't be done.

396
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,121
Response would be on us in three minutes.

397
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,889
Well, they'll kill every last one
of us, we don't get this thing.

398
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,642
We could pull a 999.

399
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,331
That's not such a bad idea.

400
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,730
That'd buy you 10 minutes.

401
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,243
- Oh, my God.
- Twenty minutes.

402
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,850
You're kidding.

403
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,740
Tell me you're fucking joking!

404
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,126
Yo, yo, yo, yo. Enough of this cop shit.

405
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,660
English.

406
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,728
999? The fuck is that?

407
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,251
Jesus Christ.

408
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,445
You gotta fuckin' love this job.

409
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,445
Hey, try not to get
a stain on your shitty suit.

410
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,340
I'm not worried. I've got two.

411
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,322
Looks like the Lae Me
sent us a kite from prison.

412
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,420
Looks that way.

413
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,488
Hey, genius,
can one of y'all turn that off?

414
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,041
Fuck.

415
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,286
Chris, this is Sergeant
Franco Rodriguez. Detective.

416
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,851
Detective, that's Chris.

417
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,645
Homicide.

418
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,204
This is my new partner.
Got called up from "Zone Two."

419
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,970
So what does working in Zone Two
tell you about all this?

420
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,483
Uh, I don't know. Let's see.

421
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,402
Which means loose lips sink ships.

422
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,085
In American.

423
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,481
Right?

424
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,900
Something like that?

425
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,540
Okay, I'm going to go look for a witness.

426
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,768
Nice to meet you, Rodriguez.

427
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,331
Any familiar faces?

428
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,005
Well, not these two losers,
but this right here

429
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,849
is Pedro Marquez.

430
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,620
Affiliated?

431
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,960
Locos o Trece.

432
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,641
Next county over.

433
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,820
But I don't know why the fuck
they'd be over here, man.

434
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,365
Probably looking for their bodies.

435
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,485
- Hey, Ed you talk to these guys yet?
- Not yet.

436
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,369
What's going on, guys?

437
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,683
Y'all been out here a while?

438
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,020
Hey, I'm just going to ask you
some questions, man.

439
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,580
You don't have to square up on me.

440
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,889
You come over here and blame us
for them fools, huh, puto?

441
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,580
I didn't say that.

442
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,205
That's exactly what
you said, motherfucker.

443
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,887
I didn't. I'm just trying to find out
if somebody saw something.

444
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,885
Fuck you, jura.

445
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,780
- All right.
- Tell you what,

446
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,565
I'll get balls deep in your pink,
you fucking feel me?

447
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,725
You, uh, want to take care
of your partner over there?

448
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,561
Motherfucker.

449
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,244
Them cuffs a little too tight.
You fucking punk bitch...

450
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,805
Shut the hell up!

451
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,580
Yo, Snaps. What's up
with your hyna here...

452
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,700
Shut the hell up.

453
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,780
Pinche mayate!

454
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,565
Hey, didn't the cop tell you
to shut the fuck up? Listen!

455
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,489
- Fuck you...
- Get him. Come with me.

456
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,322
Back up. Back the fuck up!

457
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,201
Come with me.

458
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,846
Hey, homeboy. Hey, go get a cigarette.

459
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,530
Come on, man.

460
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,203
You're closed for five minutes.

461
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,140
The fuck are you doing, man?

462
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,500
I could ask you the same thing.

463
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,900
I didn't throw a guy on the ground
and try to incite a fucking riot.

464
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,286
He was running his mouth.
You didn't hear him.

465
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,980
Running his mouth?
What, he hurt your feelings?

466
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,100
It's the fucking streets,
that's what people do.

467
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,420
You even know who that is?

468
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,660
- That was obstruction.
- Oh.

469
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,740
He was getting in the way
of my investigation.

470
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,446
Get out of school, man.
There ain't no obstruction up here.

471
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,082
That's Luis Pinto.
He's a Mara Salvatrucha lieutenant.

472
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,448
You think somebody gonna talk now?

473
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,686
- Oh, he's a lieutenant?
- Yeah.

474
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,980
I didn't realize. Well, I'll just go
and apologize to him, then.

475
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,700
This ain't a fucking game, Chris.

476
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,220
The rules around here are different.

477
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,940
This ain't Buckhead, all right?

478
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,724
So you better learn fast.

479
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,965
Hey, let me tell you something.

480
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,020
You got a problem with me,
put it on the table,

481
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,820
but don't pull me aside and question me
like you know something I don't know.

482
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,860
You let an asshole like that bow up on you
in front of the whole neighborhood,

483
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,008
you're the one who's got
some explaining to do.

484
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,220
Now, get off my back and let me do my job.

485
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,129
Oh, you know the whole game now, huh?

486
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,769
Unlock the door, stupid.

487
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,767
So what? We do this Triple 9,
we get 10 clear minutes?

488
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,171
Kill a cop? You get all damn day.

489
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,687
A 999 gets called in,

490
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,380
all units in the area converge
on the downed officer.

491
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,060
It's open-season.

492
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,300
Everybody wants a piece of a cop killer.

493
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,820
It's like pulling the plug
and the whole force going down the drain.

494
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,526
And you're absolutely sure
that you can make this happen?

495
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,766
Oh, yeah.

496
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,281
All right.

497
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,805
You the police.

498
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,687
But you...

499
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,490
You're gonna have to hard check
that fucking liability.

500
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,881
Worry about the 999, Franco.

501
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,691
I'm going to go bury my friend.

502
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,201
His brother.

503
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,361
Unless you want to help us dig a hole.

504
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,041
Yeah, I didn't fucking think so.

505
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,521
Yo.

506
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,126
Yo, my man.

507
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,847
Fucking come on, man.
Let's get out of here.

508
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,140
You good?

509
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,409
All right. Come on.

510
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,929
I should have known better.

511
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,060
There's got to be a different way.

512
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,410
What, are you suddenly getting saintly
because this FNG wears a shield?

513
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,249
There's a difference, Franco,
and you know it.

514
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,085
- Really?
- Yeah.

515
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,611
Bullshit.

516
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,140
How many cop funerals have you been
to in the last five years, huh?

517
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,724
And you tell yourself the same thing that
every cop sitting there tells himself.

518
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,925
"Better him than me."

519
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,931
If you're having
a problem with this, Marcus,

520
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,340
I'll do it.

521
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,761
I don't have a problem taking out a cop.

522
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,442
I'll do a cop just like...

523
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,288
Oh, ho, ho. A little to the right.

524
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,540
- Let's reload. Don't let 'em know.
- Missed.

525
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,642
What are you doing in there, Uncle Jeff?

526
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,762
Nothing's happening over here.

527
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,100
How's your job going?

528
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,380
I don't know, it's going all right, man,

529
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,562
but I would like to make a difference.

530
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,340
I know how that sounds.
What are you laughing at?

531
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,220
You're gonna make a difference.

532
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,460
You ain't going to
make a fucking difference.

533
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,324
Get that notion out of your head.

534
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,500
You know what you need to do?

535
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,620
Your job, keep your head on a swivel,

536
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,002
out-monster the monster,
and get home at the end of the night.

537
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,540
Uncle Jeff.

538
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,380
- Can you do that?
- Are you kidding me?

539
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,687
- No.
- You know what kind of spots I've been in?

540
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,980
A lot hairier than this...

541
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,447
- So don't worry about me.
- No. I am worried about you.

542
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,844
You don't realize...

543
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,682
Any one of these little fucking
snake-eyed motherfuckers,

544
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,682
you know, could be strapped right now.

545
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,843
I owe it to your mother.

546
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,924
I owe it to her.

547
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,285
Look, it... I can't look after you...

548
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,524
Fuck these motherfuckers.

549
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,020
Any one of these cock...

550
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,167
Hey!

551
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,500
Hey!

552
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,420
Are any of you cocksuckers
strapped right now?

553
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,500
- You?
- Jeff...

554
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,940
You got a gun on you, huh?

555
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,281
Jeff, hey. Sit down. Sit down.

556
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,460
Hey, what does little Trevor
want for his birthday?

557
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,280
Uh, he wants a gun.

558
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,020
A gun?

559
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,940
No. He wants a toy gun.

560
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,326
Another toy gun.

561
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,688
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

562
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,804
How you doing, boy?

563
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,460
- You good?
- Yeah.

564
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,561
Okay.

565
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,020
All right. Let's get this off you, man.

566
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,531
Go on, sit down.

567
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,568
There you go. There it is.

568
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,124
Just sit there for a second
while I go speak to your mother.

569
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,365
You fucking late.

570
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,084
You're lucky you get to see him at all.

571
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,770
I need to see your sister.

572
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,660
Why the fuck ain't she answering my calls?

573
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,260
Michael, I had to convince my sister
to spare you, okay?

574
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,540
Have a little gratitude.

575
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,005
You need to do this for me, okay?

576
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,163
Or you need to get the fuck out.

577
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,849
I'll see what I can do.

578
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,725
Now, hurry, okay?

579
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,409
I only have an hour.

580
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,321
Felix, come here. Come here.

581
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,004
No, no. You ain't gonna
do that in front of my son.

582
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,164
Go on. Find your mother.

583
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,049
Sit down, Michael.

584
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,527
Have some tea. We have much to discuss.

585
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,980
We do?

586
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,127
What do you want to talk about?

587
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,166
Do you want to talk about Russell?

588
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,441
Hmm.

589
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,300
Yes. That.

590
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,802
You want to get this thing done,
you stay the fuck away from my crew!

591
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,684
There you go, sweetie.

592
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,846
Hmm, so now that all of
that is out of the way,

593
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,850
Vassili would like to know
how things are progressing.

594
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,602
Tell him we've got a way to make it work.

595
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,048
This is fantastic news.

596
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,407
Yes.

597
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,620
You know, I think I'd prefer it

598
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,484
if you just watched porn.

599
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,610
I was about to.

600
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,205
Oh, good.

601
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,324
Are you sulking, baby?

602
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,281
No.

603
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,802
You look like you're sulking.

604
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,090
Listen, you wanted this job, remember?

605
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,686
We... Yea...

606
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,246
That was before I knew that it came
with a fucking asshole of a partner.

607
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,329
Come on, baby.

608
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,242
You need to work with these guys.

609
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,611
Since when does my tough guy

610
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,607
let anyone get to him.

611
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,764
Nobody got to me.

612
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,610
Now, stop feeling so sorry for yourself.

613
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,764
And come to bed.

614
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,020
My partner is not a problem.

615
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,540
Are you sure about that, man?

616
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,529
Look, I don't give a fuck
about this guy, all right?

617
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,740
He's perfect. The minute Jeffrey Allen
hears his nephew is down,

618
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,860
he'll send every cop to the call.
Right, Franco?

619
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,007
I've seen him.

620
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,540
He's our guy.

621
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,846
Look, I got a spot in mind.

622
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,531
Those abandoned projects
over on Washington.

623
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,721
All right.

624
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,689
Sounds like it's settled.

625
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,364
This guy's done nothing.

626
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,162
Does he have a family? Do you even know?

627
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,206
I don't care.

628
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,209
If it comes down to us or some cop,
I'll be damned if it's not us who walk away

629
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,049
from this thing, you understand?

630
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,440
Say it, man.

631
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,604
Say you understand.

632
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,207
Russell would've found another way.

633
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,889
Look, it's one more fucking job.

634
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,203
Just another fucking job.

635
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,968
If you in, get your shit
together right now.

636
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,965
There must be...

637
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,048
Don't do this, Mike.

638
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,404
You got a better idea?

639
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,921
You?

640
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,608
Fucking look at yourself, man!

641
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,060
Fucking look at... Fucking...

642
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,083
Get the fuck out, man!

643
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,244
Get the fuck out!

644
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,962
Now this is the house, right here.

645
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,008
That's our boy. Fat one on the porch.

646
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,220
I'm going to talk to my source.

647
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,129
You want to come with me, see if that great
police work you did yesterday paid off?

648
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,364
- You're a riot.
- All right.

649
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,081
Who are you?

650
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,580
- Who are you?
- Don't tell him your name, homie.

651
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,921
You that cop who busted up Luis
the other day?

652
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,370
That was a misunderstanding.

653
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,460
Like, why don't you go bother
some other homies, know what I'm saying?

654
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,380
Why don't y'all go to school,
you know what I'm saying?

655
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,220
Man, this homie's
getting homeschooled, bro.

656
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,300
By who?

657
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,380
By me. Teaching 'em mad skills, yo.

658
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,528
For real? Well, I got a question for you.

659
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,401
The Mara Salvatrucha sign,
where's it come from?

660
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,980
It's from here.

661
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,650
This is from here?

662
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,690
Black Sabbath.

663
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,003
Who the fuck is Black Sabbath?

664
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,660
Hey, y'all rug rats don't go to school?

665
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,683
Get out of here. Go to school, man.

666
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,004
I will arrest your little ass.

667
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,009
- Okay, stay on that.
- Okay.

668
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,840
I got two or three more
sources to check in with.

669
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,740
I'll call in later.

670
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,300
Yeah. Oh, uh...

671
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,620
Hey, someone named
Sweet Pea called you back.

672
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,721
Okay.

673
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,540
- Come on, girl.
- Hey, hey.

674
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,166
Girl, do me a favor. Go and set the bar.
I need five minutes.

675
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,100
- Girl, I got you.
- Thanks.

676
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,247
Come here.

677
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,620
You're looking good, Sweet Pea.

678
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,449
Thank you, Daddy.

679
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,700
What have you got for me?

680
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,326
Child, I don't want no parts of this.

681
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,731
I'm listening.

682
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,540
Baby-doll.

683
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,961
Mama will get killed if the tea gets out.

684
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,964
So this shit here is going to cost you,
and I ain't talking shortbread.

685
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,960
You gonna have to show me
a whole lot of coin.

686
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,322
Five G's if it goes anywhere.

687
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,641
All right, look. I'm going to tell you,
but this is it, Jeffrey.

688
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,340
I mean, I'm working here now, okay?

689
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,580
I'm doing what I do, so no more favors.

690
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,841
Okay.

691
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,446
Anyway.

692
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,620
The other night, I heard some fucked-up
bitch talking to another girl

693
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,700
about some creepy motherfucker,

694
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,610
some fierce, scary shit
like out of a horror movie.

695
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,260
Now, I only heard bits and pieces,
but this bitch kept going on and on

696
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,964
about some dude covered in red dye
looking like the devil's dick.

697
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,900
The bitch that was doing all the talking,

698
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,607
she said that this man of hers
said that he robbed a bank,

699
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,200
and, honey, all hell broke loose.

700
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,249
Oh, now, the girl who told you this,
what was her name?

701
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,604
She go by Leah.

702
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,288
Some old working junkie bitch.

703
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,007
She dance here off and on, and I see
her in the street from time to time.

704
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,123
They don't have a baby.
They just got a stroller full of dope.

705
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,860
He did good with that stroller.

706
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,725
Kicked it, folded it up like a pro.

707
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,281
Oh.

708
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,202
Unit 406 to perimeter.
We're going to let the woman leave.

709
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,420
Pick her up once she's out of the complex.

710
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,160
Fernando Rivera, AKA Termite.

711
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,900
Hitter for the Mexican Mafia,
fresh out the pen.

712
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,340
Just did an eight-year
stretch for trafficking.

713
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,727
His PO issued us a violation warrant

714
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,780
so we can talk to him about
the severed heads last week.

715
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,848
Let's see what he's got to say, boys.

716
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,201
Barry, you're shield.
Smith, you're second. Gomez, breach.

717
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,366
Second team. Jackson, shield.
Buck will be first cover.

718
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,887
Hey, Chris, you up to
take the lead on this?

719
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,406
Window!

720
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,401
Go!

721
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,081
Going up!

722
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,566
What the fuck are y'all doing?

723
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,648
- Get the fuck back in the house.
- Fuck you!

724
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,700
This is my house. Don't be telling me
to get the fuck back inside my house.

725
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,006
Breach!

726
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,441
Police!

727
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,125
Check that closet.

728
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,001
Clear!

729
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,700
Couch on the left, stairs on the right.

730
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,847
- Copy.
- Moving.

731
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,961
Check that couch, check that couch.

732
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,044
Cover. Cover.

733
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,441
Moving up.

734
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,928
Get down! Get down, motherfucker!

735
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,620
Check that bathroom.

736
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,721
Go.

737
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,880
Clear.

738
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,820
There's a baby in the bed
in the bedroom on the right.

739
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,570
I'm going right. Go left.

740
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,767
Go, move.

741
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,241
Clear.

742
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,844
Check the closet behind me.

743
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,820
Get some hands for that baby.

744
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,604
- Contact.
- Clear.

745
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,780
Termite, come on out, you dumb-fuck.

746
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,530
Let's not get your fucking baby killed!

747
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,980
Gomez, go for that door.

748
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,206
Cover me.

749
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,761
Two, go closet on left.
Three, go behind the door.

750
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,405
Closet on left. I got it.

751
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,844
- Door clear.
- Closet clear.

752
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,120
Moving up.

753
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,210
Bathroom on the right.

754
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,565
Bathroom clear.

755
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,340
Three, clear the closet on the left.

756
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,500
Two, go right.

757
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,284
- Got the closet.
- Check under that bed.

758
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,721
Clear.

759
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,601
Moving up.

760
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,660
Three, go bedroom on the right.

761
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,000
- Two, go bathroom.
- Got it.

762
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,404
- Bathroom's clear!
- Bedroom's clear!

763
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,250
Moving down.

764
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,660
He's out, he's on foot. He's on the run!

765
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,841
Go, go, go!

766
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,010
Get down, get down!

767
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,364
Get down! Get on the ground!

768
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,001
Fuck!

769
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,964
- Hey, you good?
- I'm good.

770
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,321
Go!

771
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,161
Chris.

772
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,001
Chris!

773
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,249
Chris, come on, man. Come on.

774
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,605
Are you okay?

775
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,043
- You all right?
- Go, go, go.

776
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,286
South side, heading east.
Marcus, give me your 20, man.

777
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,220
Hands! Show me your hands!
Get on the ground!

778
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,380
Get on the ground!
Hey, did you see somebody?

779
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,925
Where'd they go?

780
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,447
Fuck.

781
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,930
Get back, motherfucker, or he die!

782
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,244
What was his name?

783
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,607
Tank.

784
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,980
- That's a good name.
- It's a great name.

785
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,730
- That's a good name.
- Yeah.

786
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,930
Sorry, man.

787
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,606
I can't remember one shot from yesterday.

788
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,490
Is that weird?

789
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,251
No, man, it's called survival
stress reaction, you know?

790
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,500
Mmm-hmm.

791
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,443
Chemicals flood your brain.

792
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,780
Forebrain stops working,
your amygdala fires up

793
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,120
- and you're just...
- Mmm.

794
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,284
I didn't see him coming.

795
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,320
Right? I mean,
he just came out of nowhere.

796
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,128
It could happen to anybody, man.

797
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,530
Well, it didn't happen to you.

798
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,260
I'm a badass motherfucker, dude.

799
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,740
I'm going to take a piss.

800
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,046
Have fun.

801
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,727
Do you know what
this song is about, Michael?

802
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,001
No?

803
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,130
Then I will tell you.

804
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,660
It is about two lovers betrayed
by the secrets they keep for others.

805
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,420
And they must choose.

806
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,090
Exile or death.

807
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,242
Like me and my dear Vassili.

808
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,086
Vassili is finally coming home to me.

809
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,882
Once you have completed this job,
they will release him into Israeli custody.

810
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,700
We are going to be a family again.

811
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,140
Where's Felix?

812
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,220
We own the secrets of kings, me and him.

813
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,721
This is why we have survived so long.

814
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,925
Where's Felix?

815
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:58,969
Felix and Elena won't
be joining us tonight.

816
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,842
Here. Hear it for yourself.

817
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,524
- Elena?
- Michael.

818
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,780
Where are you?

819
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,325
Irina didn't tell you?

820
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,780
I'm gonna ask you one last time, Elena.

821
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,020
Fuck are you?

822
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,329
Felix, baby. It's your dad.
Daddy wants to speak with you.

823
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,820
I swam with the dolphins,
Daddy, me and Mommy.

824
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,940
Where you at?

825
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,300
We're staying at the beach
and Auntie Irina said we're going

826
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,260
to come here to take me to the zoo...

827
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,460
- What do you mean?
- ...for my birthday.

828
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,860
Okay, love you. Bye.

829
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,380
No, no... Wait a second.

830
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,448
Felix. No, Felix...

831
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,260
Elat. Our family home.

832
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,089
Three hours south of Tel Aviv.

833
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,010
Felix seems to love it.

834
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,660
He loves the sea.

835
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,260
Me, I do not like it much myself.

836
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,340
There is something idiotic about it.

837
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,807
Take a look. He is so cute.

838
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,660
Yeah, see, there is Elena.

839
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,841
No, no, no, Irina.

840
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,851
We're doing the job.

841
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,570
We're doing the job.

842
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,642
She has a very nice ass, my sister.

843
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,007
So, this is the objective.

844
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,803
The security key
and gate codes you will need.

845
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:51,961
The case arrives tomorrow night,
is there for 24 hours, then it ships.

846
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,100
We meet one more time after this.

847
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,486
How that goes is up to you,

848
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:02,004
and then we decide when Felix
comes home from vacation.

849
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,963
It would seem the house is burning
and the clock is ticking, Michael.

850
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,580
The room goes quiet.

851
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,886
All right, everybody, listen up.

852
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,260
This is a cop's brain. All right?

853
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,045
This is a cop's brain on some shit.

854
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,970
This is a cop asshole.

855
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,300
This is a cop's asshole in supermax.

856
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,845
Any questions?

857
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,260
That's a big asshole.

858
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,820
Hey, I've got to talk to you.

859
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,780
- Who the fuck is this?
- Don't worry, boys. Wait.

860
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,020
Hey, Jack, get them some drinks.

861
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,220
Man, come on, get them some drinks.

862
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,740
All right, you got it.

863
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,002
All right, you heard the man.
Drinks on Marcus.

864
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,060
You fucking nuts coming here!

865
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,242
You don't think somebody
from the precinct might recognize you?

866
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,970
Get up, you stupid fuck!

867
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,491
Don't fucking do this, Marcus.

868
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:33,964
You come near me again,
I swear to God, I will fucking kill you!

869
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,700
You ever actually used your gun, huh?

870
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,802
Put one in someone
that doesn't have it coming to them?

871
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,046
- Shut up.
- I know you, man!

872
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,020
- You might not think I do, but I know you!
- Shut the fuck up!

873
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,820
- You ain't gonna do this!
- Shut up!

874
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,500
Look, I can see it in your eyes.

875
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,820
You are a fucking coward, all right?

876
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,140
What, you think this
is gonna make you a man?

877
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,180
Shut up!

878
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,931
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

879
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,500
Is that him?

880
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,620
It's all right, guys. He was just leaving.

881
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,643
Didn't you hear the officer?

882
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,060
What was that all about, man?

883
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,980
Some piece-of-shit source I used to use.

884
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,889
All right, let's go get a drink.

885
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,240
Forget about it.

886
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,685
Get the fuck inside.
Just get the fuck inside!

887
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,780
Like you know who you trying to tell?

888
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,340
Get your ass inside!
No, you're not doing this tonight.

889
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,566
Get your hands off me!

890
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,620
You're not pulling
any more tricks tonight.

891
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,768
- That's the boyfriend?
- Yep.

892
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,447
Hmm.

893
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,011
Piece of work.

894
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,620
We'll put a tail on both of them.

895
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,060
All right. I've got four in tail, so...

896
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,889
Not a very healthy diet.

897
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,326
Sweet.

898
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,570
That's disgusting.

899
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,660
Waste not, want not.

900
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,900
Speak.

901
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,380
Uh, hey, I got you that info.

902
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,528
Gabriel Charles Welch, 35.

903
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,961
He, uh, served three years on the force.

904
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,820
Oh, you sure?

905
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,260
Yeah, racked up a slew of reprimands

906
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,364
before getting dismissed
for a questionable shooting.

907
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,180
Questionable how?

908
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,805
Suicide by cop.

909
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,487
Associates?

910
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,370
Yeah. None on file.

911
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,500
Oh, if there's one, there's another.

912
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,364
Ling, you always come through for me.

913
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,489
I have no doubt you will again.

914
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,325
Fucking cop.

915
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,721
Come on.

916
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,362
That's it.

917
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,561
Hmm.

918
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,805
Kicking dope, huh?

919
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,329
No fun, right?

920
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,241
Oh...

921
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,402
Oh, it kicks in nice.

922
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,960
Oh, whoa.

923
01:06:56,040 --> 01:07:00,602
This can go down one of two ways for you.

924
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,260
The girlfriend says Gabe and his brother
run with a Michael Atwood.

925
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,060
Get eyes on him.

926
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,500
Uh, she also claims
that Gabe's brother, Russell,

927
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,940
wound up dead the other day.

928
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,860
Let's see if we can't turn up a body.

929
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,500
Got you. Uh, hold on a sec. Look.

930
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,682
Ling's been trying to get a hold of you.

931
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,500
She said that, um, Gabe Welch

932
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,060
finally stopped in Highland Park.

933
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,300
And he's been on his bike
in front of some house.

934
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,300
Highland Park. What's the address?

935
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,368
Um... 806 Willow Drive.

936
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,140
Apprehend him right away.

937
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,380
Get every available unit to that address!

938
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,686
Copy that, boss.

939
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,321
Are you guys okay?

940
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,487
Yeah, we're fine.

941
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,060
Hey, boss. We lost him.

942
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,620
- Oh, God damn it.
- Sorry.

943
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,051
Lost who?

944
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,204
Why weren't you answering your phone?

945
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,500
I'm sorry. Look, Jeff, we're fine, man.

946
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,647
Everything's all right.

947
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,300
Who is this guy?

948
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,481
Gabe Welch.

949
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,100
Ring any bells?

950
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,180
No.

951
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,260
I never heard that name in my life.

952
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,060
Well, he was a cop...

953
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,049
Hey, there, little buddy.

954
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,681
- How are you doing? You okay?
- All right, baby. Come on.

955
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,060
I'll get him back.

956
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,207
Go ahead.

957
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,287
He was a cop. And now, he's part
of the crew we're investigating.

958
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,409
Why would he come here?

959
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,449
I don't know. You're investigating him,
maybe he came looking for you?

960
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,962
I mean, that's just too coincidental.

961
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,500
Speak.

962
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,620
Michael Atwood.

963
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,820
Ex-private security contractor.
He worked for Blackwater.

964
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,260
He and Russell Welch were set
to be indicted for arms smuggling

965
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,728
in a federal investigation
with Vassili Vlaslov in '08.

966
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,860
The case was dropped after
four witnesses went missing.

967
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,380
What's a Vassili Vlaslov?

968
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,460
A Russian Jew.

969
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,100
Russian mob boss to be exact.

970
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,100
Get this. Putin's so scared of this guy,

971
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,806
he put him in the Gulag
four years ago without charges.

972
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,700
Vlaslov's wife, Irina, has been running
the organization from here.

973
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,020
Totally visible.

974
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,406
It's the big, bad wolf, baby.

975
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,860
The fucking La Kosher Nostra.

976
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,420
Exactly. Uh, the captain
wants us to put eyes on her.

977
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,249
He's already detailed us bodies.

978
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,660
What?

979
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,762
You're doing something about Gabe.

980
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,660
I told you, I'm handling it.

981
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,000
Oh, really?

982
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,371
Gabe now is under
fucking surveillance, Mike.

983
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,165
They got people all
over him right now, as we speak.

984
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,980
How?

985
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,731
Oh, that whore girlfriend of his talked.

986
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,140
They on me?

987
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,940
Not yet.

988
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,580
But soon.

989
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,444
And he knows it all.

990
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:03,780
I ain't asking you. I'm telling you.

991
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,325
Do something about Gabe.

992
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,060
Mike...

993
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,220
You see what you made me do, man?

994
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,340
You see what you've made me do?

995
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,420
I'm sorry.

996
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,522
- Mike, Mike, Mike. Please, don't.
- You're out, Gabe!

997
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,780
I'm through with you!
I'm through with you, do you understand?

998
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,220
Mike, Mike, Mike.

999
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,605
If it weren't for your brother, I'd bury you
and your fucking whore right now!

1000
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,740
It's going down and you need
to stay the fuck away!

1001
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,500
Fine, fine, fine. Please.

1002
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,780
What happens to Leah?

1003
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,041
Just disappear, man!

1004
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:48,340
I'm gone, I'm gone.
I promise, I promise. Mike, Mike...

1005
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:52,604
Mike. Mike. Hey, I promise!

1006
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,300
Mike!

1007
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,526
Fuck!

1008
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,611
Have we found Gabe Welch?

1009
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,731
Uh, no, we're still looking.

1010
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,340
What about Michael Atwood?

1011
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,410
Uh, I got units placed
outside his place, but it's empty.

1012
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,820
Mmm-hmm.

1013
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,540
Irina Vlaslov?

1014
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,420
Uh, judge denied our request
for a surveillance warrant.

1015
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,521
Hmm.

1016
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,641
Well, have you followed up
on ex-military with records?

1017
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,980
Yeah, I mean, there's hundreds.

1018
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,048
We're still going through 'em.

1019
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,980
So that's it?

1020
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,060
- So far, but we...
- Yeah.

1021
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,447
I got Patterson working on something.

1022
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:10,020
Does anyone believe in Jesus Christ,
our Lord and fucking savior

1023
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:13,090
and all his miserable, dog-faced saints?

1024
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,041
I was raised Jehovah, so...

1025
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,207
Can't say I do, boss.

1026
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,620
Mmm-hmm. So does anyone believe

1027
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,140
that cops have a sixth sense,

1028
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,651
can intuit things?

1029
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,220
- Hmm...
- Yeah, I mean, you do, yes.

1030
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,500
You...

1031
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:33,220
So does anyone believe
maybe something very big

1032
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,970
is about to go down?

1033
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,140
Sure, boss.

1034
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,740
Yeah, of course.

1035
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,209
So, does anyone believe
that maybe it's better

1036
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,700
to do something more than sitting around

1037
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,804
giving me a bunch of
"I don't fucking knows"?

1038
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,001
Huh?

1039
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,882
Yeah?

1040
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,040
Right.

1041
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,443
Give a holla if anything changes.

1042
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,649
Surveillance lost Gabe last night.

1043
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,962
And Major Crimes is looking for you.

1044
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,245
Well, they'll be looking
a long time after today.

1045
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,850
You all right with this, man?

1046
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,844
Everything cool with you?

1047
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,245
Yeah, homeboy.

1048
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,567
We've got him right where we want him.

1049
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,729
Detective Belmont,
you ready to do some dirt?

1050
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,126
Huh?

1051
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,969
- I'm dirty.
- Yeah, you are.

1052
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,370
I know you are.

1053
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,890
We got here.

1054
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,921
You all right?

1055
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,620
Yeah, man, I'm good. You?

1056
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,085
- Yep.
- Good.

1057
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,820
So where are we going?

1058
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,940
Going to see an informant of mine.

1059
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,088
A dough boy named Cory Dubose.

1060
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,122
So every time he hears
the Rollin 40s moving something

1061
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,481
he, uh, gives me a call,
lets me know what's up.

1062
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,329
Let's see what he's got. Let's go.

1063
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,484
1012, Smith and Marietta.

1064
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,241
1086, domestic dispute in progress.

1065
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,203
Now, where's this guy at?

1066
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,206
Marcus?

1067
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,570
Hey, man, where you at?

1068
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,924
Marcus, where'd you go?

1069
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,607
Oh, shit.

1070
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,241
Oh, shit.

1071
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:17,921
Shit.

1072
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,167
Shit.

1073
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,491
Police! Atlanta Police Department.

1074
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,380
Put your gun down! Put it down!
Put it on the ground, man.

1075
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,900
- Wait, wait.
- Put it down on the ground.

1076
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,060
- You're a mark.
- I'm going to shoot you.

1077
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,220
Drop the fucking weapon. I will shoot you.

1078
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,380
Will you please shut up?

1079
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,005
- You're a mark...
- Drop it on the ground.

1080
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,281
Behind you!

1081
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,980
Shit!

1082
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,762
342, shots fired. Subject down.

1083
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,122
Uh, Eighth and Washington.

1084
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,140
Perp running is ID'd Luis Pinto.

1085
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,964
Hey, man, talk to me.

1086
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,568
How are you doing, man?

1087
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,361
Huh?

1088
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,491
Marcus!

1089
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,401
Marcus!

1090
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,925
Hey, Marcus!

1091
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,724
Hey, man, look at me.

1092
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,340
What's your name, man, huh?

1093
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,900
What's your name? You'll be all right.

1094
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,180
You'll be all right.

1095
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,281
You're all right.

1096
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,020
I'll just put my hand here,
it'll help you a little bit.

1097
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,531
It'll help with the blood.

1098
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,580
Hey.

1099
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,761
Listen to me.

1100
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,807
It's all right.

1101
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,250
Hey.

1102
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,081
What's your name?

1103
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,609
Shh. Slow down.

1104
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,820
Call it in, man. He's bleeding out.

1105
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,900
Call it in.

1106
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,924
Pinto came through.
He came out of nowhere, man.

1107
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,340
He just shot him. Call it in, man.

1108
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,601
Hey, what the...

1109
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,281
Marcus.

1110
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:22,721
Oh, shit...

1111
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,130
Hey. Marcus...

1112
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,971
You hear me, man?

1113
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,804
This is Unit 342,
I have an officer down. 999!

1114
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,884
Unit 342. Officer down. Triple 9!

1115
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,326
Advise if responding.
Shots fired on scene.

1116
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,580
All units copy. Triple 9.
Eighth and Washington.

1117
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,170
There it is!

1118
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,528
No, no, no. Wrong entrance.

1119
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,681
Back it up.

1120
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,725
Back it up.

1121
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,211
You guys have been here before.

1122
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:26,740
You know what?

1123
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,966
I don't even...

1124
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,602
Let's go. Triple 9. Let's go!

1125
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,460
Jeff, did you hear the dispatch?

1126
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,403
- Yeah. Triple 9.
- It's Chris.

1127
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,100
- Fuck!
- Let's go!

1128
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,300
Lock down the scene.

1129
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,447
Ling, get Colby!

1130
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:07,721
Heads up.

1131
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,046
You know who made the call?

1132
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,128
I don't know. Jeff!

1133
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,125
I see him.

1134
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,860
So we don't know if Chris is down?

1135
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,140
We're not sure. Jeff!

1136
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,288
- Jesus fucking... Get a grip!
- I got it!

1137
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,020
Move!

1138
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,260
Talk to her. Talk to her!

1139
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,771
Just do what the fuck they want!

1140
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,660
Just do what the fuck they want!

1141
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,364
Just do it!

1142
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,780
All right, up!

1143
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,201
On your feet. Hands up.
Come here. Against the wall!

1144
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:32,886
Come on. Move!

1145
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,242
- Come on. Down. Down!
- All right.

1146
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,563
I need a unit for a 211-Adam
in progress at DHS Holding.

1147
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,205
Repeat. 211-Adam.

1148
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,004
Should we respond to that?

1149
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,740
Are you guys hearing this 211?

1150
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,729
Yeah, I fucking hear it!

1151
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:53,881
Jeff!

1152
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,740
Northwest corner of Eighth
and Washington. He's lucid.

1153
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,046
Officer is down.

1154
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,409
What the fuck is going on?

1155
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,966
All right.
That's good enough, right there.

1156
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,611
You're going to do
exactly what we ask of you.

1157
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:50,220
You got 10 times that amount
strapped to your head.

1158
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,780
We can't open the vault.
It's on a rotating time lock.

1159
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,245
There's no override.

1160
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,820
Received. Any units in vicinity?

1161
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:04,340
Fuck me! Send the other car!

1162
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:05,965
Ling, you guys are on the 211.

1163
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,041
No, no. Jeff!

1164
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,410
Watch it! No!

1165
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:26,284
Dispatch, this is Charlie 463
responding to the 211.

1166
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,820
Fuck. Jesus fucking Christ.

1167
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,285
I'm seven out. Send more units.

1168
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:48,846
Fire in the hole.

1169
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,325
Two, one.

1170
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,210
Response is in.

1171
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,846
One car so far. ETA is seven minutes.

1172
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,167
Whoa, whoa... Jeff, watch it.

1173
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,969
- Back it up. Back it up.
- Let's back it up.

1174
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,940
- Chris Allen. Where's Chris Allen?
- This way.

1175
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,724
No. Don't shoot!

1176
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,491
Be advised, Atlanta PD en route.
ETA currently unknown.

1177
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,444
Tac team, Mike.
Eleven o'clock high. Four guns.

1178
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,602
Tac team, hold until
transmitter is out of range.

1179
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,926
Okay, that's it. Green, green, green.
Weapons free.

1180
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,205
Get an updated ETA on this.

1181
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,860
So this guy's a Latino,
about 30 years old.

1182
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,962
Very slight build. Local tattoos, yeah...

1183
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,207
- Jeff.
- Are you doing all right?

1184
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,125
Captain, it's Franco.

1185
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,648
I'm on the 999.

1186
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,487
En route now.

1187
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:54,881
Damn it.

1188
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,727
Are you sure you haven't
seen this Gabe Welch before?

1189
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,700
I saw him about a week ago.

1190
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,928
He came to a bar Marcus and I were at.

1191
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,180
They got into an argument.
I don't know... I didn't hear much of it.

1192
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:24,380
But Marcus said that he was just
some CI he was working with.

1193
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,088
Man, so you saw him at the bar,
at your house, here.

1194
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,727
Now, that is a cosmic
series of coincidences.

1195
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,540
Remind me to get a lottery ticket.

1196
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:38,020
Now, what about Luis Pinto?

1197
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:40,964
Luis Pinto's surrounded by SWAT
a couple of blocks from here.

1198
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,928
Detective Rodriguez. Homicide.

1199
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,283
Detective Allen. Major Crimes.

1200
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,540
All right, well maybe
we'll get some answers out of him.

1201
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:52,246
What, you think
they're just going to arrest him...

1202
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,620
Put him in a comfy cell?

1203
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:54,767
They're not.

1204
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,740
He's right.

1205
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,285
You know this guy?

1206
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,100
No, I didn't know him.

1207
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,804
But Marcus sure did.

1208
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:09,126
Oh, if you gentlemen will excuse me.

1209
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,442
Rest of you get the hell out of here.

1210
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,169
We need to get to that 211, boss.
It's a clusterfuck.

1211
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,328
Let me guess. Our crew.

1212
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,885
That's what it sounds like.

1213
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,690
Well, not all of them.

1214
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,562
What the fuck is this?
Did you wrap it for us?

1215
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,491
No, man, it's for Felix.

1216
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,249
I was not sure you could pull it off.

1217
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,805
I wasn't left much choice.

1218
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,682
What about the rest of your crew, huh?

1219
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,608
I should like to meet them finally.

1220
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,041
They're gone.

1221
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,700
Are they?

1222
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,260
So you don't think I could shake
some trees around the department

1223
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:47,180
and watch a few dirty cops
fall from the limbs?

1224
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,964
Don't give me that look.

1225
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,300
You and I, we pray at the same altar!

1226
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,980
Irina, I've been listening to you talk

1227
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,686
just about as long as I'm gonna.

1228
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,090
Where's my son?

1229
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:46,284
Where's my son, you wretched fucking cunt?

1230
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,766
Felix!

1231
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,682
We train dogs to fuck our prisoners.

1232
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,370
Can you imagine?

1233
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,620
That's what they say.

1234
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:33,420
That we degrade them with trained dogs.

1235
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:37,642
I can only guess this is how Elena felt
every time she was fucked by a monkey.

1236
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,820
I should kill you, I really should.

1237
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,526
But my fucking sister
would never forgive me.

1238
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:51,684
And more importantly,
how would Felix go on loving me so?

1239
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:56,620
Take your money and go, Michael.

1240
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:58,260
Do not look for Felix.

1241
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,885
Because I will hear it.

1242
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:22,040
I would be happy to tell him that this
is a good-bye gift from his father.

1243
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:25,128
Anything for that boy.

1244
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:01,860
Hey.

1245
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,700
The bullet fragment is
embedded in the medial...

1246
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,005
Are you okay?

1247
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:10,963
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1248
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,244
- You're bleeding.
- It's not mine.

1249
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:16,780
- How's he doing?
- He's out of surgery.

1250
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,962
He's got a bullet lodged in his skull,

1251
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:21,420
and they can't get it out because
of the swelling in the brain

1252
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,488
which may or may not go down.

1253
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,811
- Hey, Chris.
- Go on.

1254
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,764
What's up, man?

1255
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,201
Sergeant Nelson just phoned. Pinto's dead.

1256
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:35,162
SWAT put a dozen holes
in the motherfucker.

1257
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:37,780
He went out blazing.

1258
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,180
They brought him in about an hour ago.

1259
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,770
I haven't had a chance to clean him up.

1260
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:45,161
- Are those his things there?
- Yeah. Those are them.

1261
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,684
Is this everything?

1262
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,131
Yeah, that's it.

1263
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,762
Hey, Mike, it's me. Franco.

1264
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,860
Take it easy, man.

1265
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:01,769
Just fucking with you.

1266
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:06,645
You're a fucking funny guy, Franco.

1267
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:08,765
You got our money?

1268
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,006
We're all good.

1269
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:16,366
How's Marcus?

1270
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,649
That dumb fuck's still breathing.

1271
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,450
I'll take care of that.

1272
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:26,124
Just like I took care of Gabe's whore.

1273
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:28,760
Left her body in the shopping cart.

1274
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,450
Are you all right?

1275
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,530
I'm a little sore.

1276
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:39,481
Yeah.

1277
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,805
So that's it, huh?

1278
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,005
Until the next one.

1279
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:51,324
Yeah, Franco. Yeah.

1280
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,900
Come here, dude.

1281
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,685
So my boss, he's got a rule, right?

1282
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,740
First one of us who takes a gun
off the street gets the day off.

1283
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,127
Get to go home.
Sit around, put my feet up.

1284
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,084
See that, dude?
You just told me something.

1285
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,524
I bet if I lifted up your shirt,
you'd have a gun.

1286
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:02,605
You know what I'm saying?

1287
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,089
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Huh?

1288
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,810
Now, tell me something
and I'll forget about that gun.

1289
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:10,767
What do you want to know?

1290
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,929
You know my partner Marcus?

1291
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:14,767
Yeah.

1292
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,420
Was he here the morning that he got shot?

1293
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,205
Was he at the park without me?

1294
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:24,086
That morning, pulled up,
talked to my boy, Luis.

1295
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:28,460
Marcus came here
and he talked to your boy, Luis,

1296
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,700
on the morning that he got shot?

1297
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:30,801
Yeah.

1298
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:34,971
- Don't mess with me, man.
- No, man, I'm serious.

1299
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,922
All right, dude. Hey, give me the gun.

1300
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,321
- Who is it?
- Jeff, it's Chris.

1301
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,805
Jesus, man.

1302
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,762
If your mother could see me now.

1303
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:20,770
There's people you can
talk to about that, man.

1304
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,724
There's no shame in it.

1305
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:25,966
What's IA saying?

1306
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:31,860
IA is saying nobody's above
suspicion, including me.

1307
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:35,646
And Rodriguez from homicide is dismissing
the thing as pure coincidence.

1308
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:37,967
What?

1309
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,450
You know, I think it might
be worse than that.

1310
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:46,809
I think that Marcus was in on it.

1311
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:51,161
I think he had Luis Pinto try to kill me.

1312
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:54,964
Can you prove that?

1313
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:56,485
Maybe I can.

1314
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:59,482
Marcus and Gabe had history.

1315
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,763
They were both stationed
at the same precinct together.

1316
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,060
Oh.

1317
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,049
So, four-man crew...

1318
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:10,740
Michael Atwood
and one-and-a-half dead cops.

1319
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:14,640
You've got to ask yourself,
who's that fourth guy?

1320
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,161
Hey.

1321
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:21,580
Gabe Welch's girlfriend, my CI.

1322
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:25,127
Took two in the chest
and one in the back of the head.

1323
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,171
I should have seen that coming.

1324
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:33,242
Somebody's cleaning up after himself
and my bet is he wears a badge.

1325
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,100
- Boss?
- I need a favor.

1326
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:43,486
Anything.

1327
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:46,365
I need a hard copy on Leah Green's murder.

1328
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,766
I need the name of the lead cop
on the scene when they found the body.

1329
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,770
Sure, it has to be
our little secret though.

1330
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:30,765
Look at you.

1331
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,765
Look at you, you little
worthless motherfucker.

1332
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:55,651
Figured I'd find you here. How's he doing?

1333
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:56,860
What's up?

1334
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,522
I was just wondering if you wouldn't
mind coming back to the station with me.

1335
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,290
I still need to get
a full statement from you.

1336
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,324
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1337
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:17,925
All right.

1338
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:58,780
Hey, Jeff, I'm in an elevator.
I might lose you.

1339
01:46:58,880 --> 01:46:59,900
Chris? Chris?

1340
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,060
Yeah, yeah. I can hear you. Go.

1341
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:02,620
Don't do anything.

1342
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:04,290
It's Rodriguez.

1343
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:06,321
Hey, say that again?

1344
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,940
It's Detective Franco Rodriguez.

1345
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:13,690
All right. Yeah, I'll come by in a bit.

1346
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:17,846
Bye-bye.

1347
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,400
You all right, man?

1348
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,088
My car is over there.

1349
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:01,368
I'll see you over at the station.

1350
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:10,842
Unit 342, shots fired.
All Saints' Memorial.

1351
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:13,180
The roof of the parking structure.
Repeat, shots fired.

1352
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,647
- 999. All Saints' Memorial.
- Oh, fuck.

1353
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,340
Unit 342, copy 999.

1354
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,340
All Saints' Memorial. Officer down.

1355
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:35,331
All units switch to Channel 2 for 999.
Third and North Avenue.

1356
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:55,900
All units, copy. Triple 9.
Shots fired on scene.

1357
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,020
Advise if responding.

1357
