Just didn't know how to play the game.

421
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,674
Lots of different ways
to play the game, Brody.

422
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:43,149
Yeah, but in the end,
it all comes down to winning or losing.

423
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:45,777
And I think my old pal, Case,
is about to lose the hard way today.

424
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,789

Cobra, to go about 80% on Case.

your elbows, your knees

638
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:26,201
even your head were used as weapons
and were trained as such.

639
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,363
You understand?

640
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:32,445
See, striking is not just about
putting on gloves and hitting a heavy bag

641
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,845
and letting a heavy bag stop your fist.

642
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:37,816
Striking is about perfecting the technique.

643
00:37:38,207 --> 00:37:40,744
Maximum result, minimal effort. Okay?

644
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:43,312
Just like the precision of a golf swing.

645
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:46,848
You transfer all the power
into one specific point.

646
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:49,887
See?

647
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:52,191
Stop that shit.

648
00:37:53,388 --> 00:37:54,458
Okay, now look.

649
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:57,902
If I were an inch closer or further away,
they wouldn't have broken.

650
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,099
See, you have to find your sweet spot.

651
00:38:00,162 --> 00:38:01,539
So distance.

652
00:38:01,597 --> 00:38:02,871
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

653
00:38:02,931 --> 00:38:07,243
Distance along with proper technique
is where you're the most powerful.

654
00:38:07,302 --> 00:38:08,474
Now you try.

655
00:38:10,405 --> 00:38:13,181
I want you to punch through the board.

656
00:38:13,242 --> 00:38:15,017
Okay? Use these two knuckles.

657
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:17,880
Wrist straight, not like this, like this.

658
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:19,582
Go.

659
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:25,087
See?

660
00:38:25,153 --> 00:38:28,498
Now, hitting a heavy bag would give you
nearly a 100% success rate.

661
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:30,395
Not so with this.

662
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:32,962
Yeah, and it doesn't hurt your hand.

663
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:35,474
Five hundred hand strikes.

664
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,407
Knuckles and shuto.

665
00:38:37,466 --> 00:38:38,536
Five hundred kicks,

00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,813
CASE: It's nice.

797
00:44:50,372 --> 00:44:52,613
So, Morgan's adorable.

798
00:44:52,974 --> 00:44:54,044
Thank you.

799
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:55,782
I didn't mean to spring her
on you like that.

800
00:44:55,844 --> 00:44:57,084
I was going to tell you at lunch.

801
00:44:57,746 --> 00:44:59,225
It's all good.

802
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,816
I was just surprised...

803
00:45:00,882 --> 00:45:03,192
How does motherhood
work with your schedule?

804
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,325
Oh, Boonkie is the best nanny.

805
00:45:05,387 --> 00:45:07,958
She gets her to her tutor,
gymnastics, karate.

806
00:45:08,023 --> 00:45:09,024
Karate?

807
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:11,229
Yeah, karate. She loves it.

808
00:45:11,526 --> 00:45:12,527
Hmm.

809
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,706
BRODY: I told those t-shirt guys,
"Forget it."

810
00:45:15,764 --> 00:45:17,573
There's no way I'm going to do anything
for that cheap.

811
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:18,804
Not this day.

812
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:20,342
Ah, here he is.

813
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,280
All right, I don't have time
to beat around the bush.

814
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:31,789
Word on the street is you're not exactly
setting the world on fire in training camp.

815
00:45:31,846 --> 00:45:33,257
BRODY: "Word on the street"?

816
00:45:33,415 --> 00:45:35,417
You've been watching
Starsky & Hutch reruns?

817
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:36,962
Maybe Huggy Bear will come join us later?

818
00:45:37,018 --> 00:45:40,261
What are you, a fuckin' moron?
You think this is some kind of joke, huh?

819
00:45:40,689 --> 00:45:43,533
You're one loss away
from anonymity at the UFC.

820
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:45,070
I'm giving you a second life.

821
00:45:45,126 --> 00:45:47,299
I'm laying the groundwork for you
to become a fuckin' superstar

822
00:45:47,362 --> 00:45:48,864
and all you can do is
make some fuck-tasticjokes.

823
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,466
You believe this guy?

824
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,507
Brody meant no disrespect, Mr. Vega.

825
00:45:53,568 --> 00:45:55,639
Okay, I didn't ask for your input.

826
00:45:55,704 --> 00:45:56,705
Understand?

827
00:45:56,771 --> 00:45:58,944
You're supposed to be
getting this guy in fighting shape,

828
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:00,748
not making bullshit excuses for him.

829
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,650
CASE: So, what happened?

830
00:46:04,312 --> 00:46:08,021
He claimed to be a stockbroker
and died robbing a jewelry store.

831
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,858
Wow, I'm sorry to hear it.

832
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:12,526
Yeah, don't be.

833
00:46:12,587 --> 00:46:15,193
We met, got married two months later.

834
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:18,161
Kinda swept me off my feet
before I ever really got to know him.

835
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,005
Guess we live and learn, huh?

836
00:46:20,428 --> 00:46:21,805
Yeah, we do.

837
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,841
So, what else can you tell me
about yourself?

838
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,574
Other than having some
really bad-ass moves in the cage.

839
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:32,344
Well, uh, I'm from New Orleans.

840
00:46:33,975 --> 00:46:36,148
I happen to be the only person I know
without a cell phone.

841
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:38,817
I don't know how interesting that is.

842
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:43,962
But I guess I'm just like everybody else,
just trying to make it day by day, you know?

843
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:47,591
Well, there was one more thing
I was a bit curious about.

844
00:46:48,356 --> 00:46:51,360
You want to tell me a little bit
about your time in prison?

845
00:46:51,426 --> 00:46:53,030
Why you went in?

846
00:46:57,999 --> 00:46:59,410
Who told you about that?

847
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:02,571
No one told me, I just looked into it.

848
00:47:05,273 --> 00:47:06,684
"Looked into it"?

849
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:09,119
You mean, like, you investigated me?

850
00:47:09,644 --> 00:47:10,884
No.

851
00:47:10,945 --> 00:47:13,687
The Internet. Maybe you've heard of it?

852
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:18,056
Welcome to this wacky world
of dating in the 21st century.

853
00:47:20,121 --> 00:47:23,034
Look, Case, I'm sorry if I offended you.

854
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:24,570
But I've been through a lot.

855
00:47:24,826 --> 00:47:28,865
And I have to be extremely careful
about who I bring into my life.

856
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:31,872
Into Morgan's life.

857
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,644
Hey, look, I think we made a mistake.

858
00:47:37,705 --> 00:47:39,116
I need to go.

859
00:47:41,376 --> 00:47:44,152
So, what's your plan
for improving the situation?

860
00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:47,426
Because you got less than four weeks
to turn things around.

861
00:47:47,482 --> 00:47:48,586
No worries, Hugo.

862
00:47:48,817 --> 00:47:50,160
Kickin' it into high gear.

863
00:47:50,218 --> 00:47:52,289
This fight's in the bag.

864
00:47:52,353 --> 00:47:53,423
What gear are you taking?

865
00:47:53,488 --> 00:47:54,558
BRODY: I'm not taking anything.

866
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:55,828
I thought I'd give my body a rest.

867
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,626
That's a problem.

868
00:47:58,193 --> 00:47:59,831
What do you got? You bring anything?

869
00:47:59,894 --> 00:48:03,865
- Well, I got some Deca and some Winnie tabs.
- That's bullshit.

870
00:48:03,932 --> 00:48:05,969
I want you to call my guy.

871
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,106
All right, go see my doc, okay?

872
00:48:09,771 --> 00:48:13,548
He'll get you on a course
of Test Cypionate, Winstrol.

873
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:15,521
We'll throw in some Anadrol.

874
00:48:15,844 --> 00:48:18,154
(SCOFFS) Should have you in beast mode
by the time of the fight.

875
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,716
If you don't think
Braga is doing the same thing,

876
00:48:20,782 --> 00:48:22,159
you're a lot dumber than I thought.

877
00:48:24,886 --> 00:48:27,332
Come on, champ, balls to the wall.

878
00:48:28,022 --> 00:48:31,128
Give our customers and your fans
a fight they'll never forget.

879
00:48:31,626 --> 00:48:34,470
Do that and we'll all be making more money
than you know what to do with.

880
00:48:35,597 --> 00:48:38,544
All right, I'm outta here.
Lay off the nuts.

881
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,744
Keep this between us, all right?

882
00:48:44,806 --> 00:48:48,618
I don't want to hear any of Case's
holier-than-thou bullshit.

883
00:48:48,743 --> 00:48:50,745
Well, I can keep a secret.

884
00:48:50,812 --> 00:48:52,814
And, apparently, so can he.

885
00:48:53,748 --> 00:48:55,591
Okay, what?

886
00:48:57,385 --> 00:48:59,626
When I stepped out to have a smoke,

887
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:05,103
I saw your boy, Case, with Myca
and the nanny and her kid.

888
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:07,571
Just outside the restaurant.

889
00:49:07,629 --> 00:49:09,404
All nice and cozy.

890
00:49:10,498 --> 00:49:12,739
She introduced him to the kid?

891
00:49:20,742 --> 00:49:22,346
TAJ: Dude, I don't even know
why you bother.

892
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:24,447
The freak over there
probably drinks from a toilet anyway.

893
00:49:24,512 --> 00:49:26,458
CREECH: Hey, chill, she's a human being.

894
00:49:26,514 --> 00:49:27,959
TAJ: If you say so.

895
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:39,830
What's going on?

896
00:49:40,461 --> 00:49:42,600
Uh, Brody wants to spar with you.

897
00:49:43,698 --> 00:49:45,837
I think he's pissed about something.

898
00:49:46,434 --> 00:49:48,710
Hey, Case, come over here.

899
00:49:49,137 --> 00:49:51,344

Shut up.

Yo, Case, what is it, man? What's wrong?

It was completely inappropriate for me
to pry the way I did.

01:01:45,219 --> 01:01:46,664
They disqualify me?

1115
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,600
Whatever you might have taken
before you came to Thailand

1116
01:01:50,658 --> 01:01:52,365
won't still be in your system.

1117
01:01:52,426 --> 01:01:54,167
Don't worry about it.

1118
01:01:58,832 --> 01:02:01,335
Hey, I'd really like to thank you.

1119
01:02:01,769 --> 01:02:02,839
For what?

1120
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,782
Well, you said some things
I really needed to hear.

1121
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:08,786
And I'd like to show my appreciation
if you'd let me.

1122
01:02:08,842 --> 01:02:11,982
Well, I appreciate your appreciation,
Mr. Walker.

1123
01:02:12,046 --> 01:02:13,457
So what do you have in mind?

1124
01:02:13,514 --> 01:02:15,653
A Louie Thai do-over.

1125
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:18,726
I'd like that. Done.

1126
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:24,093
TAJ: Come on, Creech!

1127
01:02:24,191 --> 01:02:25,192
Whoa.

1132
01:02:58,425 --> 01:02:59,529
That's all right, bro.

1133
01:02:59,593 --> 01:03:02,005
You just didn't have it today, that's all.

1134
01:03:03,997 --> 01:03:07,137
His fucking style, man,
it's just throwing me off.

1135
01:03:07,935 --> 01:03:09,312
I can tell.

1136
01:03:10,571 --> 01:03:14,212
Dude. If it's styles that win fights,
I just gotta learn how...

1137
01:03:15,142 --> 01:03:16,143
Mmm!

1138
01:03:19,313 --> 01:03:20,553
(YELLS)

1139
01:04:09,463 --> 01:04:12,444
No flinch. Block only what comes close.

1140
01:04:26,113 --> 01:04:28,753
MYCA: You know, Brady's really lucky
to have you as a friend.

1141
01:04:28,849 --> 01:04:30,294
Loyalty is rare these days.

1142
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:32,921
CASE: Well, I consider my friends family.

1143
01:04:33,854 --> 01:04:35,265
Where is your family, Case?

1144
01:04:35,489 --> 01:04:38,868
I mean, if you don't mind me asking.
I know now you are about your privacy.

1145
01:04:39,092 --> 01:04:40,469
Okay, stop.

1146
01:04:40,994 --> 01:04:43,975
First, let me apologize
about the other evening.

1147
01:04:44,231 --> 01:04:47,337
I'm way out of practice
with this whole dating thing.

1148
01:04:47,401 --> 01:04:49,108
But I'd really like
to get to know you better,

1149
01:04:49,169 --> 01:04:53,345
so listen, you can ask me anything
from now on, okay?

1150
01:04:53,674 --> 01:04:55,210
- Okay.
- Okay.

1151
01:04:56,043 --> 01:04:59,957
So, is there a Mrs. Case?
Any little Cases running around?

1152
01:05:00,414 --> 01:05:03,020
- (CHUCKLES) No mini-Cases.
- (CHUCKLES)

1153
01:05:03,617 --> 01:05:05,927
I thought there'd be a Mrs. Case one time.

1154
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:08,592
- But turned out she was already married.
- Oh, wow.

1155
01:05:09,022 --> 01:05:11,002
- Yeah.
- That must've hurt.

1156
01:05:11,058 --> 01:05:12,264
What was up with that?

1157
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:17,071
Well, there are these women
who fixate on romancing inmates.

1158
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:18,905
There's a name for them, but I forget.

1159
01:05:18,966 --> 01:05:22,675
But once the inmate gets released,
then the fantasy's over.

1160
01:05:22,803 --> 01:05:24,510
How long ago was that?

1161
01:05:24,571 --> 01:05:25,811
Seven years ago.

1162
01:05:25,873 --> 01:05:28,444
Well, I believe seven's
a very lucky number.

1163
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,647
- You do, do you?
- Yeah, I do.

1164
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,424
Case, I think things are really gonna
start turning around for you.

1165
01:05:34,481 --> 01:05:35,653
Think so?

1166
01:05:35,716 --> 01:05:37,093
I think so.

1167
01:05:37,985 --> 01:05:39,760
- So here's my place.
- Oh.

1168
01:05:40,721 --> 01:05:41,893
(CHUCKLES)

1169
01:05:41,955 --> 01:05:43,332
Thank you.

1170
01:05:44,258 --> 01:05:47,205
So, I hope I didn't have you out too late.

1171
01:05:47,728 --> 01:05:51,107
It must be just about the time
to tuck little Morgan into bed, huh?

1172
01:05:51,164 --> 01:05:53,201
Oh, Morgan spending the night
with Boonkie tonight,

1173
01:05:53,267 --> 01:05:55,247
so, I don't have a curfew.

1174
01:05:58,939 --> 01:06:02,045
So, I guess you have to get up
pretty early to train, huh?

1175
01:06:02,109 --> 01:06:05,682
Yeah, yeah. I got to get up
pretty early to train Brody.

1176
01:06:06,747 --> 01:06:09,227
And, uh, you know, work out.

1177
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:14,089
Well, I had a really great time tonight.

1178
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:16,724
- Yeah, me, too. Me, too.
- Thank you.

1179
01:06:17,491 --> 01:06:18,834
- Yeah.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

1180
01:06:19,593 --> 01:06:20,970
Good night.

1181
01:06:26,633 --> 01:06:27,737
Bye.

1182
01:06:27,801 --> 01:06:28,905
Bye.

1183
01:06:33,373 --> 01:06:35,683
You froze again, didn't you? (CHUCKLES)

1184
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:38,814
"No, Myca, I don't have to wake up early.
I don't have to train."

1185
01:06:38,879 --> 01:06:43,191
"All I have to look forward to is going back
to my room and talking to my-goddamn-self."

1186
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,526
You are an idiot.

1187
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:46,962
All you had to do was say,

1188
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:51,400
"Well, Myca, since you don't have a curfew,
I would like to spend more time with you.

1189
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:54,530
"Since we happen to be
in front of your condo..."

1190

You'd think I'd get it.

1191

You'd think my dumb ass would get it.

1192

- But no...

What?

1199
01:07:20,854 --> 01:07:24,358
Mr. Vega has been hearing
a lot of good things about you lately.

1200
01:07:24,424 --> 01:07:26,768
Some very, very good things.

1201
01:07:26,827 --> 01:07:28,170
And I care, why?

1202
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:30,168
This.

1203
01:07:31,064 --> 01:07:32,304
What's that?

1204
01:07:32,366 --> 01:07:33,640
It's a contract.

1205
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,681
It's your contract to fight for the PFC.

1206
01:07:37,938 --> 01:07:39,474
And where's Vega?

1207
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:42,850
Don't flatter yourself.
Mr. Vega is a very busy man.

You know what, those work fine.
But these are too basic. It's too clean.

1212
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:31,769
If you haven't noticed, it's Caesar Braga.
B-R-A-G-A. It says here, "Barga."

1213
01:08:31,825 --> 01:08:34,237
"Barga," not the name. Not the name.

1214
01:08:34,294 --> 01:08:37,298
These... I'm gonna have to re-do
all of these, guys.

- No, it's Braga, like that. Not Barga like...
- Mr. Vega?

Excuse me, Mr. Vega.

Yeah, who the hell are you?

1218

Well, I'm Eddie,
but everyone just calls me Creech.

All right, how can I help you?

Oh. Mr. Walker wanted me
to deliver this to you.

1221
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:54,457
- Oh. Mr. Walker.
- Yes, sir.

1222
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:57,627
All right, um...

1223
01:08:59,486 --> 01:09:01,261
Yeah? Can I help you?

1224
01:09:01,321 --> 01:09:03,460
Well, I was just kind of wondering here...

1225
01:09:03,523 --> 01:09:05,469
No. No. No.

1226
01:09:05,525 --> 01:09:08,904
Whatever you're thinking, no. Okay?
Please, we're kind of busy here.

1227
01:09:08,962 --> 01:09:11,033
Okay, but you know it says "Barga"?

1228
01:09:11,098 --> 01:09:13,738
Okay, no, please,
just get out of here! Please!

1229
01:09:13,834 --> 01:09:16,440
This is what I'm talking about here.
Okay, even a fucking...

1230
01:09:16,503 --> 01:09:19,279
You gotta look at it. Look at it.

1231
01:09:21,141 --> 01:09:22,950
Excuse me a second.

1232
01:09:25,712 --> 01:09:27,385
What the fuck?

Who the fuck does he think he is? Hmm?

Did you find out? Did you dig up anything?

1236
01:09:38,492 --> 01:09:41,268
- I'm working on it. I'm working on it.
- Well, work a little harder. Okay?

1237
01:09:41,328 --> 01:09:43,831
I don't care if you have to dig up
the whole fucking Internet.

1238
01:09:43,897 --> 01:09:47,606
Find something. Bring it back.
Don't come back until you do.

1239
01:09:48,668 --> 01:09:50,705
Go. Go. Go. Go.

CASE: What he's done to the sport
is a travesty, man.

1242
01:09:55,175 --> 01:09:57,018
It's what he represents.

1243
01:09:57,210 --> 01:09:59,121
What? And you're so pure?

1244
01:09:59,379 --> 01:10:03,759
What's wrong with doing it clean?
That's the way it started, right?

Everybody's got their price, Case.

1246

Tell me, there's not some number out there

to convince you
to bend the rules, just a little.

1248
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,996
What does it benefit a man
if he gains the world,

1249
01:10:15,061 --> 01:10:16,301
but loses his soul, right?

01:10:45,225 --> 01:10:48,138
Showed up yesterday on Worldstar.
Then it just exploded.

1260

Now it's everywhere.

1261

That happened years ago, I was framed.

under the jail for this shit?

That's five years mandatory.

that I have his consent.

You have my consent
if you go out there and whip his ass.

1423

Now, go get in the ring before I do
something nasty with these crutches.

Bye, James gang.

you wouldn't fight for Vega.

(SCOFFS) Yeah, but, I mean,

But I will promise you this.

Hugo Vega pulls strings
at many different levels.

1468
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:16,987
He needs big numbers on this fight
or he loses everything.

you're the reason for the big numbers.

Brody getting hurt was the best thing
that could have ever happened to Hugo Vega.

Why would you want to practice leg locks
with that guy after what happened to Brody?

to take out Brady's leg?

Get the fuck outta here.
It was an accident.

1482

I had Brody in a heel-lock
and he spun the wrong way.

1485

You sent a two-word text,
10 minutes after your session with Brody.

"It's done."

You fuckin' serious? Put your hands down.

1488
01:24:17,837 --> 01:24:19,976
I'm definitely not going
to the cops with this.

1489
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:21,848
Vega's the one that needs to suffer.

1490
01:24:22,074 --> 01:24:23,348
Way I see it,

1491
01:24:23,409 --> 01:24:27,186
the way we beat Vega
is by Case beating his man.

1492
01:24:27,246 --> 01:24:28,418
That's how we hurt him.

1493
01:24:28,481 --> 01:24:30,859
Exactly. And after you defeat Braga,

You'd be the champ then,
you call the shots.

1496
01:24:35,454 --> 01:24:37,661
But then Vega still makes
a shitload of money

1497
01:24:37,723 --> 01:24:40,329
and gets away with what he did to Brody.

(SIGHS)

1499
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,140
I could just walk away and not fight.

1500
01:24:44,196 --> 01:24:46,107
Yeah, that would screw him royally.

1501
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:48,668
But then you'd be out of the other
half-million you get after the fight.

1502

Yo, let me crack his jaw

1733
01:39:21,806 --> 01:39:24,286
We tap their jaws and wrap in gauze

1734
01:39:24,743 --> 01:39:27,246
Bloody fists
Yo, let me crack his jaw

1735
01:39:27,312 --> 01:39:29,918
Overhand rights, a couple uppercuts

1736
01:39:29,981 --> 01:39:32,791
Left to the mid-section
His leg buckles up

1737
01:39:32,851 --> 01:39:35,661
Put on the black gloves,
It's time to knuckle up

1738
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,997
Put 'em in the ring
and watch me fuck 'em up

1739
01:39:39,057 --> 01:39:41,503
Fucking with me
That's a huge mistake

1740
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:44,403
Heavyweights get knocked out
by cruiserweights

1741
01:39:44,462 --> 01:39:47,102
Got 'em scared to death,
Got 'em losin' weight

1742
01:39:47,165 --> 01:39:50,044
Death is the prize that the loser takes

1743
01:40:58,370 --> 01:40:59,713
Do you back down?

1744
01:40:59,771 --> 01:41:01,148
I don't back down

1745
01:41:01,206 --> 01:41:02,378
Do you back down?

1746
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:03,612
I never back down

1747
01:41:03,675 --> 01:41:05,313
Tell me, do you back down?

1748
01:41:05,377 --> 01:41:06,822
I don't back down

1749
01:41:06,878 --> 01:41:08,152
Do you back down?

1750
01:41:08,213 --> 01:41:09,351
I never back down

1751
01:41:09,414 --> 01:41:11,155
Tell me, do you back down?

1752
01:41:11,216 --> 01:41:12,593
I don't back down

1753
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:13,822
Do you back down?

1754
01:41:13,885 --> 01:41:15,091
I never back down

1755
01:41:15,186 --> 01:41:16,790
Tell me, do you back down?

1756
01:41:16,855 --> 01:41:18,630
I don't back down

1757
01:41:18,723 --> 01:41:20,930
Back down, back down

1758
01:41:21,305 --> 01:42:21,771
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
