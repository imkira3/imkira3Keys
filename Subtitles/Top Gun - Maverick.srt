<i>Today, we're looking at
some of the hottest weather...</i>

13
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:05,985
Hey.

14
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:11,685
What is it?

15
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:14,985
What?

16
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:16,885
We've been ordered
to stand down.

17
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:18,685
They're scrapping the program.

18
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,585
They say we fell short.

19
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:23,785
The contract threshold
is Mach 10.

20
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:26,185
Mach 10 is supposed to be
in two months.

21
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:28,185
Today's test point is Mach 9.

22
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:30,085
Well, that's not good enough.

23
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:31,485
Says who?

24
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:33,485
Admiral Cain.

25
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:35,785
The Drone Ranger.

26
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:38,285
He wants our budget for
his unmanned program.

27
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:42,385
He's on his way to kill the test
and shut us down personally.

28
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:57,685
Well, he isn't here yet.

29
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:02,985
They want Mach 10,

30
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:05,085
let's give 'em Mach 10.

31
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:25,685
Now remember, the
contract threshold is Mach 10.

32
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,385
Not 10.1. Not 10.2.
Mach 10.

33
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:31,785
That should keep
the program alive.

34
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:36,085
I don't like that look, Mav.

35
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:39,785
It's the only one I got.

<i>Dark star, Control.

38
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:56,785
Loud and clear. Takeoff precheck's

<i>Ready left engine start.</i>

00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:05,185
Thumbs for taxi.

00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:09,285
We are ready for taxi.

<i>Tower, this is Dark star. We

Rear Admiral Chester Cain.

52
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:38,685
Maverick,
Cain just pulled up to the gate.

53
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:40,985
It's not too late to stop,
buddy.

54
00:07:41,985 --> 00:07:45,085
<i>You know what happens to you
if you go through with this.</i>

55
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:49,285
I know what happens
to everyone else if I don't.

56
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:53,685
<i>Dark star is ready for takeoff.</i>

57
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:57,585
Everyone,

58
00:07:57,785 --> 00:08:00,285
go for takeoff,
starting with engine.

59
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,185
Engine, go.
Thermals, go.

60
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:04,185
Fuel, go.
Electric, go.

61
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:05,885

62
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,485
<i>Dark star, Control.

63
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:10,285
All right, sweetheart,

64
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:11,985
one last ride.

65
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:41,585
<i>Dark star, you are cleared
above 600. Increase to Mach 3.5.</i>

66
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:45,885
Cleared above 600.
Increase to Mach 3.5.

67
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:53,185
Admiral.

68
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:56,385
Uh, just in time, sir.
I'm early. So are you.

69
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:57,785
You care to explain?

70
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:00,085
Transitioning to scramjet.

71
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,685
Uh, Mav,
Admiral Cain is asking...

72
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:18,085
Ordering. Ordering
that we bring her down.

<i>...within six...</i>

00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:29,185
This is where we've had
trouble with comms, sir.

78
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:31,585
It's the Earth's curvature.
It's called "Earth Bulge."

79
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:33,185
Did anyone offer you a coffee?

80
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:35,985
Okay.

81
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:45,485
He's at Mach 7, pushing 8.

82
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,985
Flight data?
Receiving. Data is good.

83
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:56,385
Temperature's climbing. Response
is still stable. We're feeling good.

Mach 9.

87
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:07,285
He's the fastest man alive.

88
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:28,185
Talk to me, Goose.

89
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:31,285
Mach 9.1.

90
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:33,385

93
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:49,285
Approaching high hypersonic.

94
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:03,185
Windshield hot caution.

95
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:13,985
Surface temp rising.

96
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:21,285
Come on, sweetheart,
just a little more.

97
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:23,985
Just a little.

98
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:27,885
Come on!

99
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:35,385
Come on!

100
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:43,285
Mach 10!

101
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:46,285
Put that
in your Pentagon budget!

102
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:49,385
Sir.

103
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,185
Oh, don't do it.
Don't do it.

104
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:03,285
Just...

105
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:07,385
a little push.

106
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:13,185
Holy shit.

107
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:25,585
You got some balls,
stick jockey.

108
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:26,985
I'll give you that.

109
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:32,885
Oh, shit.

110
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:39,085
Maverick.

111
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,385
Maverick!

112
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:33,885
Thank you.

113
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:36,185
Where am I?

114
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:38,385
Earth.

115
00:13:52,885 --> 00:13:54,085
<i>Maverick.</i>

116
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:56,885
Thirty-plus years of service.

117
00:13:57,785 --> 00:13:59,285
Combat medals.

118
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:00,885
Citations.

119
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:05,885
Only man to shoot down three
enemy planes in the last 40 years.

120
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:07,685
"Distinguished."

121
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:11,385
"Distinguished."
"Distinguished."

122
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:16,285
Yet you can't get a promotion,
you won't retire,

123
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:19,385
and despite your best efforts,
you refuse to die.

124
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:24,585
You should be at least a two-star
admiral by now, if not a senator.

125
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:26,485
Yet here you are:

126
00:14:27,985 --> 00:14:29,285
Captain.

127
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:31,485
Why is that?

128
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:33,685
It's one of
life's mysteries, sir.

129
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:37,285
This isn't a joke.
I asked you a question.

130
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:41,285
I'm where I belong, sir.

131
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:44,585
Well, the navy
doesn't see it that way.

132
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:46,685
Not anymore.

133
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,985
These planes
you've been testing,

134
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:51,885
Captain,

135
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:55,485
one day, sooner than later,
they won't need pilots at all.

136
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:59,385
Pilots that need to sleep,
eat, take a piss.

137
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:03,685
Pilots that disobey orders.

138
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:08,185
All you did was buy some
time for those men out there.

139
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:11,485
The future is coming,

140
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:14,385
and you're not in it.

141
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:18,385
Escort this man off the base.

142
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,985
Take him to his quarters.

143
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:23,985
Wait with him
while he packs his gear.

144
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:29,285
I want him on the road to
North Island within the hour.

145
00:15:32,685 --> 00:15:34,185
North Island, sir?

146
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:36,985
Call came in
with impeccable timing,

147
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:41,985
right as I was driving here to
ground your ass once and for all.

148
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:45,285
It galls me to say it, but...

149
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:50,485
for reasons known only to the
Almighty and your guardian angel...

150
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,985
you've been called back
to TOPGUN.

151
00:15:58,885 --> 00:16:02,485
Sir? You are dismissed, Captain.

152
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:10,085
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

153
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:12,485
Your kind is headed
for extinction.

154
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:17,685
Maybe so, sir.

155
00:16:19,185 --> 00:16:20,985
But not today.

156
00:17:25,685 --> 00:17:29,085
<i>Captain Pete
"Maverick" Mitchell.</i>

157
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:31,385
Your reputation precedes you.

158
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,685
Thank you, sir.

159
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:36,485
Wasn't a compliment.

160
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:40,185
I'm Admiral Beau Simpson.
I'm the Air Boss.

161
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:42,785
I believe you know
Admiral Bates. Warlock, sir.

162
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:45,685
Must admit, I wasn't
expecting an invitation back.

163
00:17:45,785 --> 00:17:47,885
They're called orders, Maverick.

164
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:50,485
You two have
something in common.

165
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:53,385
Cyclone here was first
in his class back in '88.

166
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:55,585
Actually, sir,
I finished second.

167
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:58,385
Just want to manage
expectations.

168
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:03,785
The target...

169
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,385
is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant

170
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:10,785
built in violation
of a multilateral NATO treaty.

171
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:13,985
The uranium produced there
represents a direct threat

172
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:15,285
to our allies in the region.

173
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:16,885
The Pentagon has tasked us

174
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:19,585
with assembling a strike
team and taking it out

175
00:18:19,785 --> 00:18:22,185
before it becomes
fully operational.

176
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:26,385
The plant sits in an underground
bunker at the end of this valley.

177
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:27,985
Said valley is GPS-jammed

178
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:30,885
and defended by an extensive
surface-to-air missile array

179
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,685
serving a limited number
of fifth-generation fighters,

180
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:37,885
which in turn are backed up by a
plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.

181
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:40,085
Even a few old F-14s.

182
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,785
Seems like we're not the only
ones holding on to old relics.

183
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:46,685
What's your read, Captain?

184
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:51,885
Well, sir, normally this would be
a cakewalk for the F-35's stealth,

185
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:54,385
but the GPS-jamming
negates that.

186
00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:58,485
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates
a low-level laser-guided strike

187
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:00,085
tailor-made for the F-18.

188
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:01,585
I figure,

189
00:19:01,785 --> 00:19:03,685
two precision bombs, minimum.

190
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:06,685
Makes it four aircraft
flying in pairs.

191
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:08,885
That is one hell of a
steep climb out of there,

192
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:11,685
exposing you to all
the surface-to-air missiles.

193
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:13,685
You survive that,

194
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:16,085
it's a dogfight
all the way home.

195
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:19,485
All requirements for which
you have real-world experience.

196
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:22,185
Not in the same mission, sir.

197
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:25,885
No.

198
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:30,985
No, someone's
not coming back from this.

199
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,385
Can it be done or not?

200
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:34,985
How soon before the plant
becomes operational?

201
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:36,985
Three weeks. Maybe less.

202
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:40,985
Well, it's been a while since
I've flown an F-18, and...

203
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:44,285
I'm not sure who I'd trust
to fly the other three.

204
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:46,485
But I'll find a way
to make it work.

205
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,585
I think you misunderstand,
Captain.

206
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:49,985
Sir?

207
00:19:50,085 --> 00:19:51,885
We don't want you to fly it.

208
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:53,485
We want you to teach it.

209
00:19:56,185 --> 00:19:57,585
Teach, sir?

210
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:02,385
We've recalled 12 TOPGUN
graduates from their squadrons.

211
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:04,885
We want you to narrow
that pool down to six.

212
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:07,685
They'll fly the mission.

213
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:10,785
Is there a problem, Captain?

214
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:14,985
You know there is, sir.

215
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:17,185
Yeah.

216
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:19,785
Bradley Bradshaw,
aka "Rooster."

217
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,985
I understand you used to fly
with his old man.

218
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:23,985
What was his call sign?

219
00:20:24,785 --> 00:20:26,185
"Goose," sir.

220
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:27,585
Tragic what happened.

221
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:29,585
Captain Mitchell was
cleared of any wrongdoing.

222
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,485
Goose's death was an accident.

223
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:33,285
Is that how you see it, Captain?

224
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:35,685
Is that how Goose's son sees it?

225
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:41,385
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not a teacher.

226
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:42,985
You were a TOPGUN
instructor before.

227
00:20:43,085 --> 00:20:45,585
That was almost 30 years ago.
I lasted two months.

228
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:47,085
It's not where I belong.

229
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:49,085
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

230
00:20:49,185 --> 00:20:53,385
You were not my first choice. In
fact, you weren't even on the list.

231
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:56,485
You are here at the request
of Admiral Kazansky.

232
00:20:56,585 --> 00:21:00,085
Now, Iceman happens to be
a man I deeply admire,

233
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:03,685
and he seems to think that you
have something left to offer the navy.

234
00:21:04,385 --> 00:21:06,385
What that is, I can't imagine.

235
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:09,785
You don't have to take this job.

236
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:10,885
But let me be clear:

237
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:14,185
This will be your last post,
Captain.

238
00:21:15,485 --> 00:21:19,485
You fly for TOPGUN, or you
don't fly for the navy ever again.

239
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:29,785
Twenty bucks
you can't get three in a row.

240
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:13,285
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

241
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:17,085
Pete.

242
00:22:18,385 --> 00:22:19,385
Penny?

243
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:21,685
What are you doing here?

244
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:23,985
I should ask you the same thing.

245
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:27,285
Well, that is a long story.
I doubt that.

246
00:22:27,385 --> 00:22:28,385
Yeah.

247
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:30,085
Who'd you piss off this time?

248
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:31,685
Another admiral.

249
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:32,885
Exactly.

250
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:38,085
Are you mad at me?
Oh, Pete.

251
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:41,785
I can never stay mad at you.
That's the problem.

252
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:42,885
Huh.

253
00:22:42,985 --> 00:22:45,585
I got to say, North Island
is the one place

254
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:47,485
I thought for sure
I'd never run into you.

255
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:49,585
Mmm.
How long you been here?

256
00:22:49,685 --> 00:22:51,485
Bought this place
about three years ago.

257
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:53,685
Three years?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

258
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:58,185
Not long after you got shipped off to the
desert for pissing off that other admiral.

259
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:01,185
That was three years ago?

260
00:23:02,085 --> 00:23:04,285
You must be in a lot of trouble.

261
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:07,185
No way you'd come
back here willingly.

262
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:09,985
Well,

263
00:23:10,685 --> 00:23:12,585
you'll sort it out.

264
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:14,485
No, I think, uh...

265
00:23:15,485 --> 00:23:17,885
I think this is it.
Come on, Pete.

266
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:20,585
You've been saying that
as long as I've known you.

267
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:24,285
You said it after they busted you
for taking me on a joyride in that F-18.

268
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:27,485
Then the next thing I know,
you're off to Bosnia.

269
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:30,685
Then Iraq. Both times.

270
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,485
You get yourself in trouble,

271
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:36,485
Iceman makes a call,
and you're back in the air.

272
00:23:36,585 --> 00:23:38,185
Penny, this is different.

273
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:39,585
Pete, trust me,

274
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,885
as improbable
as it seems right now,

275
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:45,685
somehow you'll be back in a
fighter plane with your tail on fire.

276
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:48,385
Penny...
Too late.

277
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:49,685
What?

278
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:51,985
You were about to ask me
what time I get off.

279
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:57,185
Don't give me that look.

280
00:23:58,085 --> 00:24:01,285
I'm not giving you any look.
I swear.

281
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:04,085
It always ends
the same with us, Pete.

282
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,585
Let's not start this time.

283
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:12,885
Okay.

284
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,885
Okay.

285
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:18,190
♪ Put on your red shoes
And dance the blues... ♪

286
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:20,785
You look good.

287
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:32,685
Much appreciated, pal.

288
00:24:35,185 --> 00:24:36,485
What am I missing?

289
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:42,485
"Disrespect a lady, the navy, or
put your cell phone on my bar..."

290
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:44,485
"...and you buy a round."

291
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:46,085
For everyone?

292
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:49,185
I'm afraid rules are rules.
You're lucky it's early.

293
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:52,185
Oh, come on!

294
00:24:52,285 --> 00:24:54,685
What do we have here?

295
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:58,185
If it ain't Phoenix!

296
00:24:58,285 --> 00:25:01,085
And here I thought
we were special, Coyote.

297
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:05,285
Turns out the invite
went to anyone.

298
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:07,585
Fellas, this here's Bagman.

299
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:09,385
Hangman.
Whatever.

300
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:12,085
You're looking at the only
naval aviator on active duty

301
00:25:12,185 --> 00:25:13,885
with a confirmed
air-to-air kill.

302
00:25:14,085 --> 00:25:15,085
Stop.

303
00:25:15,185 --> 00:25:17,285
Mind you, the other guy
was in a museum piece

304
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:18,685
from the Korean War.

305
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:21,585
Cold War. Different
wars, same century.

306
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:22,685
Not this one.

307
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:24,185
Who are your friends?

308
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:26,285
Payback.
Fanboy.

309
00:25:26,385 --> 00:25:28,385
Hey, Coyote.
Hey.

310
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,185
Who's he?
Who's who?

311
00:25:33,185 --> 00:25:34,885
When did you get in?

312
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:36,985
Oh, I've been here
the whole time.

313
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:39,685
The man's a stealth pilot.
Literally.

314
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:42,285
Weapons systems officer,
actually.

315
00:25:42,385 --> 00:25:44,285
With no sense of humor.

316
00:25:46,385 --> 00:25:47,785
What do they call you?

317
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:49,485
Bob.

318
00:25:49,585 --> 00:25:51,085
No, your call sign.

319
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:52,785
Uh...

320
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,185
Bob.

321
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:56,985
Bob Floyd.

322
00:25:57,085 --> 00:26:00,085
You're my new backs eater?
From Lemoore?

323
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,085

Who's gonna be team leader?

353
00:27:55,085 --> 00:27:56,185

Hangman, the only place you'll
lead anyone is an early grave.

Whoo!

357
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:16,985

Welcome to your special
training detachment.

414
00:32:57,085 --> 00:32:58,185
Be seated.

415
00:32:58,385 --> 00:33:01,185
I'm Admiral Bates,
NAWDC commander.

416
00:33:01,385 --> 00:33:03,385
You're all TOPGUN graduates.

417
00:33:03,985 --> 00:33:05,185
The elite.

418
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:07,785
The best of the best.

419
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:10,485
That was yesterday.

420
00:33:10,685 --> 00:33:14,585
The enemy's new fifth-generation
fighter has leveled the playing field.

421
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:16,385
Details are few,
but you can be sure

422
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:18,685
we no longer possess
the technological advantage.

423
00:33:18,785 --> 00:33:21,985
Success, now more than ever,

424
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:25,385
comes down to the man or woman
in the box.

425
00:33:26,185 --> 00:33:28,385
Half of you will make the cut.

426
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:30,285
One of you will
be named mission leader.

427
00:33:30,485 --> 00:33:33,485
The other half
will remain in reserve.

428
00:33:34,585 --> 00:33:36,485
Your instructor
is a TOPGUN graduate

429
00:33:36,685 --> 00:33:39,185
with real-world experience
in every mission aspect

430
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,185
you will be expected to master.

431
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:44,385
His exploits are legendary.

432
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:47,785
And he's considered
to be one of the finest pilots

433
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:50,185
this program has ever produced.

434
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:52,785
What he has to teach you

435
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:56,585
may very well mean the
difference between life and death.

436
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,785
I give you
Captain Pete Mitchell.

437
00:33:59,885 --> 00:34:02,585
Call sign: "Maverick."

438
00:34:07,285 --> 00:34:08,585
Good morning.

The F-18 NATOPS.

440
00:34:19,785 --> 00:34:24,285
It contains everything they want
you to know about your aircraft.

441
00:34:24,385 --> 00:34:27,185
I'm assuming you know the book
inside and out.

442
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:28,685
Damn right.
Damn straight.

443
00:34:28,785 --> 00:34:30,185
You got it.

444
00:34:37,985 --> 00:34:39,285
So does your enemy.

445
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:41,685
And we're off.

446
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:45,885
But what the enemy
doesn't know is your limits.

447
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,185
I intend to find them,

448
00:34:48,385 --> 00:34:50,185
test them,

449
00:34:50,685 --> 00:34:51,885
push beyond.

450
00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:56,785
Today we'll start with
what you only think you know.

451
00:34:58,485 --> 00:35:00,285
You show me what you're made of.

452

00:35:08,885 --> 00:35:10,785
Lieutenant Bradshaw!

455
00:35:13,185 --> 00:35:14,385
Yes, sir.

456
00:35:15,185 --> 00:35:17,185
Let's not do it like this.

457
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:19,685
You gonna wash me out?

458
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,585
That'll be up to you, not me.

459
00:35:24,785 --> 00:35:26,285
Am I dismissed?

460
00:35:43,485 --> 00:35:45,985
Good morning, aviators.
This is your captain speaking.

461
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:48,485
Welcome to basic
fighter maneuvers.

462
00:35:49,685 --> 00:35:52,585
<i>As briefed, today's exercise
is dog fighting.</i>

463
00:35:52,685 --> 00:35:54,585
<i>Guns only, no missiles.</i>

464
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:58,385
We do not go below the hard deck
of 5,000 feet.

465
00:35:58,585 --> 00:36:01,385
<i>Working as a team, you have
to shoot me down, or else.</i>

466
00:36:01,585 --> 00:36:04,785
Or else what, sir?
Or else I shoot back.

467
00:36:04,885 --> 00:36:07,785
<i>If I shoot either one of
you down, you both lose.</i>

468
00:36:07,885 --> 00:36:11,085
This guy needs an ego check.
We'll see to that.

469
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:13,885
What say we put some skin in the
game? What do you have in mind?

470
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:17,085
Whoever gets shot down first
has to do 200 push-ups.

471
00:36:17,185 --> 00:36:19,685
Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

472
00:36:19,885 --> 00:36:22,085
They don't call it an
exercise for nothing, sir.

473
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:24,085
You got yourself a deal,
gentlemen.

474
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:26,685
Fight's on.
Let's turn and burn.

475

Fanboy, you see him?
Nothing on radar up ahead.

476
00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:32,585
He must be somewhere behind us.

477
00:36:34,185 --> 00:36:34,985
<i>Yeah!</i>

478
00:36:35,085 --> 00:36:36,685

00:36:52,485 --> 00:36:54,485
Payback, where's your wing man?

486
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:56,685
Rooster, where are you?
I got your back.

487
00:36:56,885 --> 00:36:59,385
I'm coming. Hang in there.
Hang in there.

488
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:00,985
Hurry up, man! Hurry up!

489
00:37:04,585 --> 00:37:07,685
Payback, break right.
Breaking right.

490
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:11,285
Rooster just saved your life,
fellas. But it's gonna cost him.

491
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:13,485
Not this time, old man.

492
00:37:15,785 --> 00:37:17,685
Don't let him
get to you, Maverick.

493
00:37:24,185 --> 00:37:26,885
Rooster, you're too low! Pull
up! You're hitting the hard deck!

494
00:37:26,985 --> 00:37:29,785

But it's not.
Down!

00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:49,585
And now you know a little
something about Rooster.

502
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,785
Whoo!
Wow.

503
00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:54,285
Hold that tarmac down till
we get back, brother, all right?

Get in there, boys.

That's a kill.

Damn it.

507

It was all fun and games in

<i>Say, Phoenix.</i>

00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,585
"Bob" stands for something?

00:38:09,685 --> 00:38:11,885
<i>- Other than Robert, I mean.
- Don't take the bait, Bob.</i>

512

Want to know why
we call him Hangman?

513
00:38:14,285 --> 00:38:16,385
I got it. "Baby On Board."

514
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:20,585
Shit!

515
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:23,285
Greetings, aviators.
Fight's on.

<i>All right, Phoenix,
let's take this guy out!</i>

517
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:27,585
Watch your back, Phoenix.

518
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:29,885
Break right!
Breaking right.

519
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,185
Where's he going?

520
00:38:33,285 --> 00:38:34,685
That's why we call him Hangman.

521
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:36,485
He'll always
hang you out to dry.

522
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:38,585
Leaving your wing man.

523
00:38:38,785 --> 00:38:40,485
There's a strategy
I haven't seen in a while.

524
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,785
He called you a man, Phoenix.
You gonna take that?

525
00:38:42,985 --> 00:38:44,385
So long as he doesn't
call you a man.

526
00:38:44,585 --> 00:38:46,485
Talk to me, Bob.
Where's Maverick?

527
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,485
Jesus, his nose
is already coming around!

528
00:38:48,685 --> 00:38:50,285
Get him off me, Hangman!

529
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:53,985
For all you folks at home,
this is how you bury a fossil.

530
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:56,685
All right, Hangman.
Time to teach you a lesson.

531
00:38:56,885 --> 00:38:58,885
You're out, Phoenix.
Son of a bitch!

532
00:39:00,185 --> 00:39:01,385
That's it.

533
00:39:01,585 --> 00:39:02,985
Let's go, Mav.
Let's see what you got.

534
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:04,485
Come get me.

535
00:39:05,985 --> 00:39:07,985
Evil be gone.
Hangman's coming.

536
00:39:08,885 --> 00:39:11,485
Yeah, you're good.
I'll give you that.

Shit.

539
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:20,785
Phoenix, I can't see him.
How close am I?

540
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:23,385
Phoenix?
I'm dead, dickhead.

541
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:25,385
See you in the afterlife,
Bagman.

542
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:29,085
Where is he?
Where is he?

543
00:39:29,185 --> 00:39:30,385
That's a kill.

544
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:34,485
Seventy-nine. Down.

<i>Let's go. Who's next?</i>

I got you, Omaha.
Damn it!

547
00:39:41,885 --> 00:39:44,285
Lights out, Coyote.
Copy kill.

548
00:39:44,385 --> 00:39:48,985
Down. Fifty-one.
Down. Fifty-two.

549
00:39:51,585 --> 00:39:54,585
So, Rooster, mind if I ask you
a personal question?

550
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:55,885
Would it matter if I did?

551
00:39:55,985 --> 00:39:58,085
What's the story
with you and Maverick?

552
00:39:58,285 --> 00:40:01,485
It seems like he's got you rattled.
That's none of your business.

553
00:40:01,585 --> 00:40:03,385
Now where the hell is he?

554
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,485
<i>Been here the whole time.</i>

555
00:40:06,285 --> 00:40:08,185
Holy shit.

556
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:11,385
You see me now?

557
00:40:12,085 --> 00:40:14,185
Come on, let's get it over with.

558
00:40:14,685 --> 00:40:16,185
Fight's on!

559
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:20,485
What is with these two?

560
00:40:24,485 --> 00:40:28,185
All right, you put us here.
How you gonna get yourself out?

561
00:40:28,285 --> 00:40:30,685
You can bail out anytime.

562
00:40:30,785 --> 00:40:32,385
How low you want to go, Rooster?

563
00:40:32,485 --> 00:40:35,785
I can go as low as you, sir!
And that's saying something.

564
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:41,185
What's past is past.
For both of us.

565
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:43,085
You'd like to believe that,
wouldn't you?

566
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:47,185
Hard deck is 5,000 feet, fellas.
You are running out of room.

567
00:40:47,285 --> 00:40:50,285
<i>Altitude. Your strategy is
about to run us into the ground.</i>

568
00:40:50,485 --> 00:40:53,185
<i>- What's your move?
- Altitude. Altitude.</i>

569
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:54,785
<i>Altitude.</i>

570
00:40:56,285 --> 00:40:59,285
<i>Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.</i>

571
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:01,985
<i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

572
00:41:03,785 --> 00:41:06,685
<i>Pull up! Pull up!
Pull up! Pull up!</i>

573
00:41:07,285 --> 00:41:08,485
<i>Pull up! Pull up!</i>

574
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:13,385
You got it.
Don't think, just do.

575
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:17,085
Come on, Rooster, you got him!
Drop down and take the shot!

576
00:41:18,485 --> 00:41:19,685
It's too low.

577
00:41:20,485 --> 00:41:22,285
Too late. You had your chance.

578
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:31,185
That's a kill. Knock it off.

579
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:33,185
Damn it!

580
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,285
Same old Rooster.

581
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:40,185
Go see Hondo
about your push-ups.

582
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:49,685
All right, that's enough.

583
00:41:49,785 --> 00:41:52,785
Rooster.
That's enough, man.

584
00:42:06,585 --> 00:42:10,485
Breaking the hard deck, insubordination.
Are you trying to get kicked out?

585
00:42:10,585 --> 00:42:12,085
Don't worry about it.

586
00:42:12,185 --> 00:42:15,085
Look, I'm going on this mission.

587
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:18,585
But if you get kicked out, you
leave us flying with Hangman.

588
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:23,185
Talk to me. What the hell
was that? He pulled my papers.

589
00:42:23,285 --> 00:42:26,885
What? Who?
Maverick.

590
00:42:27,885 --> 00:42:30,685
He pulled my application
to the Naval Academy.

591
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:33,685
Set me back four years.

592
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:37,685
Why would he do that?

593
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:45,485
The hard deck is 5,000 feet
above ground level.

594
00:42:45,585 --> 00:42:47,885
A parameter is set not just
for the safety of our pilots,

595
00:42:48,085 --> 00:42:49,685
but for the safety
of their aircraft.

596
00:42:49,885 --> 00:42:53,985
5,000 feet is not just a rule. It is
a law, as immutable as gravity.

597
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:56,785
The hard deck will be much
lower for the mission, sir.

598
00:42:56,885 --> 00:42:59,885
And it will not change
without my approval!

599
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:01,885
Especially not
in the middle of an exercise.

600
00:43:02,085 --> 00:43:05,885
And that Cobra maneuver of yours?
That could've got all three of you killed.

601
00:43:05,985 --> 00:43:07,885
I never want to see
that shit again.

602
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,185
What exactly do you suppose
you were teaching, Captain?

603
00:43:11,285 --> 00:43:13,685
That as good as they are, sir,
they still have something to learn.

604
00:43:13,685 --> 00:43:16,485
You are talking about the best
fighter pilots on the planet, Captain.

605
00:43:16,485 --> 00:43:18,285
And they've been told that
their entire career,

606
00:43:18,285 --> 00:43:20,185
while they've been dropping
bombs from a high altitude

607
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:22,285
with little to no dog fighting.

608
00:43:22,385 --> 00:43:24,885
The parameters of this mission call for
something they have never encountered.

609
00:43:24,885 --> 00:43:29,485
Okay, you have less than three weeks
to teach them how to fight as a team

610
00:43:29,685 --> 00:43:30,885
and how to strike the target.

611
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:32,985
And how to come home.

612
00:43:35,685 --> 00:43:37,885
And how to come home, sir.

613
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:45,785
Every mission has its risks.

614
00:43:45,885 --> 00:43:47,685
These pilots accept that.

615
00:43:47,785 --> 00:43:49,685
I don't, sir.

616
00:43:53,285 --> 00:43:54,985
Every morning,
from this day forward,

617
00:43:55,085 --> 00:43:57,485
you will brief us on your
instructional plans in writing.

618
00:43:57,585 --> 00:44:00,485
And nothing will change
without my express approval.

619
00:44:00,585 --> 00:44:04,185
Including the hard deck, sir?
Especially the hard deck, Captain.

620
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,285
Sir.

621
00:44:08,185 --> 00:44:09,285
What is this?

622
00:44:09,385 --> 00:44:11,185
It's a request to lower
the hard deck, sir,

623
00:44:11,385 --> 00:44:13,785
to practice a low-level bombing
run per the mission parameters.

624
00:44:19,485 --> 00:44:22,385
You could learn a thing or two
about timing, Captain.

625
00:44:22,985 --> 00:44:24,185
<i>Yo, Coyote.</i>

626
00:44:24,785 --> 00:44:26,285
Take a look at this.

627
00:44:29,985 --> 00:44:32,685
The man, the legend.
There he is.

628
00:44:32,785 --> 00:44:34,985
No, no, no.
Next to him.

629
00:44:35,785 --> 00:44:37,985
He look familiar to you?

630
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:41,485
What have we here?

631
00:44:42,085 --> 00:44:44,085
Bradshaw.

632
00:44:44,785 --> 00:44:46,785
As I live and breathe.

633
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:52,385
Hey, Theo, you got big.

634
00:44:52,985 --> 00:44:53,985
Hey, Mav.

635
00:45:01,385 --> 00:45:02,385
Amelia?

636
00:45:02,485 --> 00:45:03,885
I know. I got big.

637
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:05,385
Yes.

638
00:45:06,485 --> 00:45:07,585
Bar opens at 5:00.

639
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:10,485
No, I just came by
to pay off a debt.

640
00:45:10,585 --> 00:45:12,085
Mom!

641
00:45:16,385 --> 00:45:19,485
Hey, how's your dad?
With his wife, in Hawaii.

642
00:45:19,585 --> 00:45:21,185
Mom!

643
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,385
Mav says he owes you money.

644
00:45:24,585 --> 00:45:27,785
Oh. Don't worry
about it. I insist.

645
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:34,585
Thank you, Captain.
Consider your tab closed.

646
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:37,185
Captain? Still?

647
00:45:37,285 --> 00:45:40,185
A highly decorated captain.

648
00:45:40,285 --> 00:45:41,185
Finish up.

649
00:45:41,285 --> 00:45:42,985
We have to get the boat
to the yard.

650
00:45:43,085 --> 00:45:44,985
I can't go. What do
you mean, you can't go?

651
00:45:45,085 --> 00:45:48,285
Test tomorrow. I have to
study. They only told us today.

652
00:45:48,485 --> 00:45:50,585
Well, I can't sail her alone.

653
00:45:50,685 --> 00:45:51,985
Just use the engine.

654
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:54,385
Why are we taking her
to the yard?

655
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,085
To fix the engine.

656
00:45:56,185 --> 00:45:58,385
Mm-hmm.
I can help.

657
00:46:04,285 --> 00:46:07,485
Little rougher than I was expecting.
You don't say.

658
00:46:07,585 --> 00:46:11,385
Pull on the back stay.
We'll de-power the sails.

659
00:46:11,485 --> 00:46:12,785
Okay.

660
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:14,885
What does that mean?

661
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:18,085
You're supposed to be
in the navy!

662
00:46:18,185 --> 00:46:21,985
I don't sail boats, Penny.
I land on them.

663
00:46:22,085 --> 00:46:25,385
It's sort of like raising
the flaps on an airplane.

664
00:46:25,585 --> 00:46:27,085
So how do I do that?

665
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,885
You pull on that
green line up there.

666
00:46:29,985 --> 00:46:31,485
Green line.

667
00:46:33,885 --> 00:46:35,185
Yep. Pull it hard.

668
00:46:35,385 --> 00:46:38,385
Yep. Crank that winch
right there,

669
00:46:38,585 --> 00:46:40,485
tighten the jib.

670
00:46:41,085 --> 00:46:43,485
Crank it. You okay? Yeah.

671
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,085
Good.

672
00:46:47,285 --> 00:46:48,285
Now,

673
00:46:49,585 --> 00:46:50,985
you ready?

674
00:46:52,885 --> 00:46:54,485
For what?

675
00:46:54,585 --> 00:46:56,285
The afterburner.

676
00:47:16,285 --> 00:47:18,385
Now you're in the navy.

677
00:47:40,385 --> 00:47:42,485
Thanks for helping out today.

678
00:47:43,985 --> 00:47:45,585
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

679
00:47:47,385 --> 00:47:48,585
Hmm.

680
00:47:50,885 --> 00:47:52,485
Don't give me that look.

681
00:47:52,585 --> 00:47:53,785
What look?

682
00:47:53,885 --> 00:47:55,685
That one.

683
00:47:58,885 --> 00:48:00,285
Good night, Pete.

684
00:48:00,885 --> 00:48:02,385
Night, Penny.

685
00:48:17,785 --> 00:48:19,785
Mom, is that you?

686
00:48:19,885 --> 00:48:21,385
Yeah, it's me.

687
00:48:22,085 --> 00:48:23,785
I'll make you dinner.

688
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:25,185
Okay.

689
00:48:31,085 --> 00:48:33,485
Time is your greatest enemy.

690
00:48:34,685 --> 00:48:36,885
Phase one of the mission
will be a low-level ingress

691
00:48:36,985 --> 00:48:38,585
attacking in two-plane teams.

692
00:48:38,685 --> 00:48:41,385
You'll fly along this narrow
canyon to your target.

693
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:44,985
Radar-guided surface-to-air
missiles defend the area.

694
00:48:45,085 --> 00:48:47,685
These SAMs, they're lethal.

695
00:48:47,885 --> 00:48:51,685
But they were designed to protect
the skies above, not the canyon below.

696
00:48:51,885 --> 00:48:55,785
That's because the enemy knows no one
is insane enough to try and fly below them.

697
00:48:56,785 --> 00:48:59,485
That's exactly what
I'm gonna train you to do.

698
00:48:59,585 --> 00:49:03,985
On the day, your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum.

699
00:49:04,085 --> 00:49:05,485
You exceed this altitude...

700
00:49:05,585 --> 00:49:07,985
...radar will spot you

701
00:49:08,085 --> 00:49:10,485
and you're dead.

702
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:12,985
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

703
00:49:13,685 --> 00:49:14,685
minimum.

704
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,985
Time to target:
two and a half minutes.

705
00:49:17,085 --> 00:49:22,085
That's because fifth-generation
fighters wait at an air base nearby.

706
00:49:22,185 --> 00:49:26,485
In a head-to-head with these
planes in your F-18s, you're dead.

707
00:49:27,685 --> 00:49:30,385
That's why you need to get in,
hit your target and be gone

708
00:49:30,585 --> 00:49:33,585
before these planes even
have a chance of catching you.

709
00:49:33,785 --> 00:49:36,885
This makes time
your greatest adversary.

710
00:49:38,285 --> 00:49:42,285
<i>You'll fly a route in your nav
system that simulates the canyon.</i>

711
00:49:42,485 --> 00:49:44,285
<i>The faster you navigate
this canyon,</i>

712
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:46,985
<i>the harder it'll be to stay under
the radar of these enemy SAMs.</i>

713
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,085
<i>The tighter the turns,</i>

714
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:50,985
<i>the more intensely
the force of gravity</i>

715
00:49:51,085 --> 00:49:52,985
<i>on your body multiplies...</i>

716
00:49:53,185 --> 00:49:54,685
<i>...compressing your lungs...</i>

717
00:49:54,785 --> 00:49:57,285
<i>...forcing the blood
from your brain...</i>

718
00:49:57,385 --> 00:49:59,585
<i>...impairing your judgment
and reaction time.</i>

719
00:49:59,685 --> 00:50:02,085
So for today's lesson, we're
gonna take it easy on you.

720
00:50:02,285 --> 00:50:05,485
Max ceiling: 300 feet.
Time to target: three minutes.

721
00:50:07,185 --> 00:50:08,585
Good luck.

722
00:50:16,685 --> 00:50:18,485
Time to target is one minute 30.

723
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:20,985
We are two seconds behind.
Increase to 480 knots.

724
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,585
We got to move, Coyote.

725
00:50:23,285 --> 00:50:24,885
Copy. Increasing speed.

726
00:50:25,085 --> 00:50:26,285
Oh!

727
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:28,485
Oh, shit!

728
00:50:31,685 --> 00:50:32,885
Why are they dead?

729
00:50:32,985 --> 00:50:35,985
We broke the 300-foot ceiling,
and a SAM took us out.

730
00:50:36,085 --> 00:50:37,685
No. Why are they dead?

731
00:50:37,885 --> 00:50:40,085
I slowed down and didn't give
her a warning. It was my fault.

732
00:50:40,085 --> 00:50:43,185
Was there a reason you didn't communicate
with your team? I was focusing on...

733
00:50:43,285 --> 00:50:45,985
One that their family
will accept at the funeral.

734
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,285
None, sir.

735
00:50:48,285 --> 00:50:49,685
Why didn't you
anticipate the turn?

736
00:50:49,685 --> 00:50:51,285
You were briefed on the terrain.

737
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:54,585
Don't tell me.
Tell it to his family.

738
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:02,285
Hangman, ease up.
The canyon's getting tighter.

739
00:51:02,385 --> 00:51:05,085
Negative, Payback.
Increase your speed.

740
00:51:06,385 --> 00:51:10,285
You're going too fast, man. No
harm in being ahead of schedule.

741
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,885
Damn it, slow down!
I can't stay on the course!

742
00:51:15,085 --> 00:51:18,185
You're gonna hit the wall!
Watch out! Watch out!

743
00:51:21,485 --> 00:51:24,185
- What happened?
- I flew as fast as I could.

744
00:51:24,285 --> 00:51:26,085
Kind of like my ass
depended on it.

745
00:51:26,285 --> 00:51:29,885
And you put your team in danger,
and your wing man's dead.

746
00:51:30,985 --> 00:51:32,685
They couldn't keep up.

747
00:51:38,285 --> 00:51:41,185
<i>Rooster, we're 20 seconds
behind and dropping.</i>

748
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:43,885
We're fine. Speed is good.

749
00:51:44,085 --> 00:51:45,685
Increase to 500 knots.

750
00:51:45,785 --> 00:51:48,485
<i>Negative, Yale. Hold your
speed. Rooster, we're late!</i>

751
00:51:48,685 --> 00:51:51,385
We're alive. We'll make
up time in the straightaway.

752
00:51:51,585 --> 00:51:52,985
<i>We are not gonna make it.</i>

753
00:51:53,085 --> 00:51:56,185
Just trust me. Maintain
your speed. We can make it.

754
00:51:56,385 --> 00:51:58,485
Why are you dead?

755
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:00,085
You're team leader up there.

756
00:52:00,185 --> 00:52:02,585
Why are you,
why is your team dead?

757
00:52:02,785 --> 00:52:05,385
Sir, he's the only one
who made it to the target.

758
00:52:05,585 --> 00:52:07,585
A minute late.

759
00:52:07,685 --> 00:52:10,185
He gave enemy aircraft
time to shoot him down.

760
00:52:10,285 --> 00:52:12,085
He is dead.
You don't know that.

761
00:52:12,185 --> 00:52:15,785
You're not flying fast enough.
You don't have a second to waste.

762
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:17,585
We made it to the target.

763
00:52:17,685 --> 00:52:20,685
And superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out.

764
00:52:20,785 --> 00:52:23,785
Then it's a dogfight. Against
fifth-generation fighters.

765
00:52:23,885 --> 00:52:26,485
Yeah. We'd still have
a chance. In an F-18.

766
00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:29,185
It's not the plane, sir,
it's the pilot.

767
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:30,585
Exactly!

768
00:52:37,485 --> 00:52:40,185
There's more than one way
to fly this mission.

769
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:41,885
You really don't get it.

770
00:52:43,085 --> 00:52:45,985
On this mission,
a man flies like Maverick here,

771
00:52:46,085 --> 00:52:47,985
or a man does not come back.

772
00:52:48,985 --> 00:52:50,385
No offense intended.

773
00:52:51,185 --> 00:52:53,585
Yet somehow you always manage.

774
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:56,485
Look, I don't mean to criticize.

775
00:52:56,585 --> 00:52:58,485
You're conservative, that's all.
Lieutenant.

776
00:52:58,585 --> 00:53:03,485
We're going into combat, son, on
a level no living pilot's ever seen.

777
00:53:04,885 --> 00:53:06,185
Not even him.

778
00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:09,885
That's no time to be
thinking about the past.

779
00:53:13,685 --> 00:53:15,485
What's that supposed
to mean? Rooster.

780
00:53:15,585 --> 00:53:18,385
I can't be the only one that knows
that Maverick flew with his old man.

781
00:53:18,385 --> 00:53:20,985
That's enough. Or that Maverick
was flying when his old man...

782
00:53:21,185 --> 00:53:23,585
Lieutenant, that's enough!

783
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:25,785
That's enough.
You son of a bitch!

784
00:53:25,885 --> 00:53:27,285
Hey, come on!

785
00:53:27,485 --> 00:53:29,185
I'm cool,
I'm cool. Hey, hey.

786
00:53:29,285 --> 00:53:31,585
- That's enough.
- He's not cut out for this mission.

787
00:53:31,685 --> 00:53:34,285
That's enough!
You know it.

788
00:53:36,885 --> 00:53:37,985
You know I'm right.

789
00:53:44,285 --> 00:53:45,585
You're all dismissed.

790
00:54:49,885 --> 00:54:51,385
Maverick.

791
00:54:53,385 --> 00:54:54,885
It's come back?

792
00:54:55,385 --> 00:54:56,985
No one knows.

793
00:54:58,885 --> 00:55:01,485
There's nothing else
they can do.

794
00:55:01,585 --> 00:55:04,785
Even speaking is painful now.

795
00:55:10,485 --> 00:55:12,585
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

796
00:55:32,085 --> 00:55:33,185
Admiral.

797
00:55:44,585 --> 00:55:45,985
How's my wing man?

798
00:55:57,485 --> 00:55:59,885
Please, don't worry about me.

799
00:56:00,585 --> 00:56:02,685
What can I do for you?

800
00:56:10,985 --> 00:56:12,085
All right.

801
00:56:14,785 --> 00:56:18,085
Well, Rooster's still angry
with me about what I did.

802
00:56:19,285 --> 00:56:22,485
I thought eventually
he would understand why.

803
00:56:24,485 --> 00:56:26,385
I hoped he'd forgive me.

804
00:56:34,485 --> 00:56:36,385
The mission is less
than three weeks away.

805
00:56:36,485 --> 00:56:38,785
The kid's not ready.

806
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:49,085
He doesn't want
what I have to give.

807
00:56:50,185 --> 00:56:51,385
Ice, please,

808
00:56:51,585 --> 00:56:53,685
don't ask me to send
someone else to die.

809
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,185
Please don't...

810
00:56:55,885 --> 00:56:57,685
Don't ask me to send him.

811
00:56:57,885 --> 00:56:59,585
Send me.

812
00:57:31,185 --> 00:57:32,885
I don't know how.

813
00:57:45,885 --> 00:57:47,885
I'm not a teacher, Ice.

814
00:57:50,185 --> 00:57:52,085
I'm a fighter pilot.

815
00:57:54,585 --> 00:57:56,085
A naval aviator.

816
00:57:58,485 --> 00:58:00,785
It's not what I am.

817
00:58:01,785 --> 00:58:03,685
It's who I am.

818
00:58:05,185 --> 00:58:07,085
How do I teach that?

819
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:12,085
Even if I could teach it,
it's not what Rooster wants.

820
00:58:12,185 --> 00:58:14,485
It's not what the navy wants.

821
00:58:14,585 --> 00:58:17,085
That's why they canned me
the last time.

822
00:58:19,785 --> 00:58:22,985
The only reason I'm here is you.

823
00:58:29,985 --> 00:58:32,085
If I send him on this mission,

824
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,285
he might never come home.

825
00:58:38,885 --> 00:58:41,185
And if I don't send him,

826
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:43,285
he'll never forgive me.

827
00:58:45,785 --> 00:58:48,585
Either way,
I could lose him forever.

828
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,985
I know.

829
00:59:00,585 --> 00:59:02,085
I know.

830
00:59:12,985 --> 00:59:16,985
The navy needs Maverick.

831
00:59:18,785 --> 00:59:22,385
The kid needs Maverick.

832
00:59:23,285 --> 00:59:25,885
That's why I fought for you.

833
00:59:27,685 --> 00:59:30,185
That's why you're still here.

834
00:59:38,185 --> 00:59:39,685
Thank you, Ice,

835
00:59:39,885 --> 00:59:42,085
for everything.

836
00:59:46,785 --> 00:59:48,285
One last thing.

837
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:50,585
Who's the better pilot?

838
00:59:50,785 --> 00:59:52,185
You or me?

839
00:59:55,085 --> 00:59:57,685
This is a nice moment.

Sir.

01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,285
What is this?
This is dogfight football.

864
01:02:04,485 --> 01:02:06,985
Offense and defense
at the same time.

Who's winning?

866
01:02:08,885 --> 01:02:11,385
I think they stopped
keeping score a while ago.

867
01:02:11,485 --> 01:02:14,485
This detachment still has some
training to complete, Captain.

868
01:02:14,685 --> 01:02:16,985
Every available
minute matters. Yes, sir.

869
01:02:17,085 --> 01:02:19,185
So why are we out here
playing games?

870
01:02:19,285 --> 01:02:21,485
You said to create a team, sir.

871
01:02:22,785 --> 01:02:24,085

Should I go?
Before Amelia gets back?

879
01:04:06,285 --> 01:04:08,985
She'll be at her friend's
house tonight. Oh, good.

880
01:04:11,885 --> 01:04:13,885
You and Amelia, you seem...

881
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,685
a lot closer
than when I last saw you.

882
01:04:18,885 --> 01:04:21,385
Yeah. Yeah, we are.
How do you manage?

883
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:25,485
Well,

884
01:04:25,685 --> 01:04:29,185
you know, she always wanted more
freedom than I thought she was ready for.

885
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:32,385
Hmm. Where'd she
get that from, I wonder?

886
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:37,385
I guess I realized

887
01:04:38,085 --> 01:04:40,385
I also had to trust her.

888
01:04:41,685 --> 01:04:44,985
Let her make some of her
own mistakes sometimes.

889
01:04:46,785 --> 01:04:48,685
Not an easy choice.
Mmm.

890
01:04:52,685 --> 01:04:55,085
Is that what happened
with Rooster?

891
01:04:58,385 --> 01:05:01,385
I pulled his papers
from the Naval Academy.

892
01:05:04,185 --> 01:05:06,185
Took years off his career.

893
01:05:12,385 --> 01:05:13,485
Why?

894
01:05:15,985 --> 01:05:19,985
His mother never wanted him to
fly, not after what happened to Goose.

895
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:25,885
She made me promise
before she died, so...

896
01:05:25,985 --> 01:05:28,185
Does Rooster know that?

897
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:34,685
He will always resent me
for what I did.

898
01:05:36,385 --> 01:05:39,185
Why should he resent her too?

899
01:05:43,385 --> 01:05:45,685
Not an easy choice.
Hmm.

900
01:05:48,085 --> 01:05:50,685
I was trying to be
the father he lost.

901
01:05:53,785 --> 01:05:54,985
I just...

902
01:05:57,485 --> 01:05:59,985
I wish I would've
done it better.

903
01:06:01,985 --> 01:06:05,085
But the truth is...

904
01:06:07,285 --> 01:06:09,385
I didn't think he was ready.

905
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,685
Is he ready now?

906
01:06:17,285 --> 01:06:19,585
Mom, I'm home!

907
01:06:20,885 --> 01:06:23,385
I thought you were staying
at Karen's tonight.

908
01:06:23,485 --> 01:06:26,285
Karen's sick.
And I've got homework to do.

909
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:28,685
I should go.
You should go.

910
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:32,185
Have you had dinner yet?
Not yet. You wanna go out?

911
01:06:32,285 --> 01:06:35,185
No, it's okay.
I'll make you something.

912
01:06:35,285 --> 01:06:37,185
I'll be down in a sec!

913
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:39,485
Wait! Not that way.
What?

914
01:06:40,985 --> 01:06:43,085
Look, I have an example to set.

915
01:06:43,285 --> 01:06:45,785
I can't be bringing guys
home on a first date.

916
01:06:45,885 --> 01:06:47,385
This is not our first date.

917
01:06:48,285 --> 01:06:50,185
You know what I mean.

918
01:06:52,685 --> 01:06:53,785
Okay.

919
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:56,685
Fine.

920
01:06:56,785 --> 01:06:59,085
But this is the last time
I go out your window.

921
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:00,685
We'll see.

922
01:07:00,885 --> 01:07:02,885
No. No, I mean it.

923
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:05,185
I'm never gonna leave you again.

924
01:07:06,885 --> 01:07:08,385
Oh, shut up.

925
01:07:08,485 --> 01:07:10,585
Go on, get out of here.

926
01:07:24,085 --> 01:07:26,285
Just don't
break her heart again.

927
01:07:37,585 --> 01:07:38,885
<i>Good morning.</i>

928
01:07:38,985 --> 01:07:41,085
The uranium enrichment plant
that is your target

929
01:07:41,185 --> 01:07:43,485
will be operational
earlier than expected.

930
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:47,485
Raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days' time.

931
01:07:47,585 --> 01:07:50,585
As a result, your mission
has been moved up one week

932
01:07:50,685 --> 01:07:54,085
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation.

933
01:07:54,285 --> 01:07:57,285
Sir, no one here has successfully
flown a low-level course.

934
01:07:57,385 --> 01:07:59,585
Nevertheless, you've
been ordered to move on.

935
01:08:00,685 --> 01:08:01,685
Captain.

936
01:08:04,485 --> 01:08:06,785
We have one week left
to focus on phase two.

937
01:08:06,885 --> 01:08:08,785
It's the most difficult stage
of the mission.

938
01:08:08,885 --> 01:08:10,585
It's a pop-up strike
with a steep dive,

939
01:08:10,785 --> 01:08:14,085
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles.

940
01:08:15,085 --> 01:08:16,285
<i>Two pairs of F-18s will fly</i>

941
01:08:16,485 --> 01:08:17,885
<i>in a welded wing formation.</i>

942
01:08:18,085 --> 01:08:21,885
<i>Teamwork. Precise coordination
of these aircraft is essential</i>

943
01:08:21,985 --> 01:08:24,685
<i>to both the mission's success
and your survival.</i>

944
01:08:24,785 --> 01:08:27,485
As you know, the plant rests
between two mountains.

945
01:08:27,685 --> 01:08:32,585
On final approach, you'll
invert directly into a steep dive.

946
01:08:32,685 --> 01:08:35,685
<i>This allows you to maintain
the lowest possible altitude</i>

947
01:08:36,585 --> 01:08:38,685
<i>and the only possible
attack angle.</i>

948
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:46,985
Your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide.

949
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:49,085
<i>The two-seat aircraft
will paint the target</i>

950
01:08:49,285 --> 01:08:51,485
<i>with a laser bull's-eye.</i>

951
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:53,485
The first pair
will breach the reactor

952
01:08:53,585 --> 01:08:57,285
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

953
01:08:57,385 --> 01:09:00,285
This will create an opening
for the second pair.

954
01:09:00,485 --> 01:09:02,285
That's miracle number one.

955
01:09:04,085 --> 01:09:07,085
<i>The second team
will deliver the kill shot...</i>

956
01:09:08,385 --> 01:09:10,485
...and destroy the target.

957
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:12,985
That's miracle number two.

958
01:09:14,285 --> 01:09:16,685
<i>If either team
misses the target...</i>

959
01:09:18,685 --> 01:09:20,985
<i>- That's a miss.
- ...the mission is a failure.</i>

960
01:09:21,185 --> 01:09:22,385
Damn it!

961
01:09:22,585 --> 01:09:24,985
Egress
is a steep high-G climb out

962
01:09:25,185 --> 01:09:26,885
to avoid hitting this mountain.

963
01:09:28,985 --> 01:09:32,285
A steep climb at that speed,
you're pulling at least eight G's.

964
01:09:32,485 --> 01:09:33,785
Nine, minimum.

965
01:09:33,885 --> 01:09:36,585
The stress limit
of the F-18's airframe is 7.5.

966
01:09:36,785 --> 01:09:38,285
That's the accepted limit.

967
01:09:38,385 --> 01:09:40,485
To survive this mission,
you'll pull beyond that,

968
01:09:40,585 --> 01:09:43,585
even if it means
bending your airframe.

969
01:09:43,685 --> 01:09:47,885
<i>You'll be pulling so hard, you'll
weigh close to 2,000 pounds,</i>

970
01:09:47,985 --> 01:09:50,585
<i>your skull
crushing your spine...</i>

971
01:09:50,785 --> 01:09:53,985
<i>...your lungs imploding like an
elephant's sitting on your chest,</i>

972
01:09:54,085 --> 01:09:57,785
<i>fighting with everything you
have just to keep from blacking out.</i>

973
01:09:59,685 --> 01:10:02,585
And this is where you'll be
at your most vulnerable.

974
01:10:03,285 --> 01:10:05,885
This is Coffin Corner.

975
01:10:06,085 --> 01:10:08,585
Assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain,

976
01:10:08,685 --> 01:10:12,485
you'll climb straight up into enemy
radar while losing all of your airspeed.

977
01:10:12,685 --> 01:10:15,985
Within seconds, you'll be
fired upon by enemy SAMs.

978
01:10:17,185 --> 01:10:19,985
You've all faced sustained
G's before, but this...

979
01:10:20,085 --> 01:10:23,985
This is gonna take you and
your aircraft to the breaking point.

980
01:10:24,085 --> 01:10:26,885
Sir, is this even achievable?

981
01:10:26,985 --> 01:10:28,885
The answer to that question

982
01:10:28,985 --> 01:10:31,485
will come down
to the pilot in the box.

983
01:10:40,985 --> 01:10:43,085
Talk to me, Bob. We are
12 seconds late on target.

984
01:10:43,185 --> 01:10:46,085
We gotta move! We gotta
move! Copy. Try to stay with me.

985
01:10:49,185 --> 01:10:51,585
Huh? Wait, who's that?

986
01:10:52,485 --> 01:10:53,985
<i>Blue Team, you've been spotted.</i>

987
01:10:54,085 --> 01:10:56,385
Shit, it's Maverick.
What the hell is he doing here?

988
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:59,785
I'm a bandit on course to intercept.
Blue Team, what are you gonna do?

989
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:03,185
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock.
700 knots closure.

990
01:11:03,285 --> 01:11:04,885
Your call.
What do you want to do?

991
01:11:05,085 --> 01:11:07,785
Continue. We're close.
Stay on target.

992
01:11:07,885 --> 01:11:10,985
He's swinging around to the
north! Stand by for pop-up.

993
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:14,385
Be ready on that laser, Bob.
Copy. I'm on it.

994
01:11:15,585 --> 01:11:17,285
Blue Team,
bandit is still closing.

995
01:11:17,485 --> 01:11:18,485
Popping now.

996
01:11:24,685 --> 01:11:26,785
Talk to me, Bob.
Where's Maverick?

997
01:11:26,885 --> 01:11:29,385
He's five miles out.
He's coming fast.

998
01:11:34,785 --> 01:11:37,985
Target's in sight.
Where's my laser, Bob?

999
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:41,585
Dead eye! Dead eye! It's no good.
Sorry, I can't get a lock.

1000
01:11:41,685 --> 01:11:43,785
We're out of time.
I'm dropping blind.

1001
01:11:46,985 --> 01:11:48,485
Damn it, missed!

1002
01:11:59,085 --> 01:12:00,785
That's tone.

1003
01:12:00,985 --> 01:12:03,385
Maverick's got missile
lock on us. Shit! We're dead.

1004
01:12:04,185 --> 01:12:05,585
Blue Team, that's a fail.

1005
01:12:05,685 --> 01:12:06,885
Level out, Coyote.

1006
01:12:09,385 --> 01:12:11,585
<i>Coyote? Do you copy?</i>

1007
01:12:14,185 --> 01:12:16,185
<i>Coyote, come in.</i>

1008
01:12:16,285 --> 01:12:18,185
<i>Coyote, level wings.</i>

1009
01:12:18,285 --> 01:12:19,685
Oh, God. He's in G-LOC.

1010
01:12:19,785 --> 01:12:22,885
<i>Coyote? Coyote?</i>

1011
01:12:23,085 --> 01:12:25,685
He's gonna burn in!
I'm going after him.

1012
01:12:28,585 --> 01:12:30,985
Come on. Give me tone,
give me tone, give me tone.

1013
01:12:31,085 --> 01:12:34,585
Snap out of it, Coyote.
Come on! Come on!

1014
01:12:37,385 --> 01:12:39,985
Come on, Coyote, come on.
Come on!

1015
01:12:40,085 --> 01:12:42,185
<i>- Damn it! Coyote! Coyote!
- Pull up!</i>

1016
01:12:42,285 --> 01:12:45,385
<i>- Coyote! Coyote!
- Pull up! Pull up!</i>

1017
01:12:50,385 --> 01:12:51,985
Coyote, you okay? You okay?

1018
01:12:52,085 --> 01:12:55,085
I'm okay. I'm good.

1019
01:12:55,885 --> 01:12:58,985
Good. Good.
That's enough for today.

1020
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,185
That was close.

1021
01:13:02,285 --> 01:13:03,885
Too close.

1022
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:06,585
Bird strike! Bird strike!

1023
01:13:06,785 --> 01:13:08,685
Bird strike!

1024
01:13:11,085 --> 01:13:14,085
Phoenix, left engine's
on fire! Climbing.

1025
01:13:15,885 --> 01:13:18,385
Throttling back. Shutting
off fuel to left engine.

1026
01:13:18,485 --> 01:13:20,485
Extinguishing fire.

1027
01:13:21,585 --> 01:13:23,485
Right engine is out!

1028
01:13:23,585 --> 01:13:25,285
It's still spinning.
Trying to restart it.

1029
01:13:27,785 --> 01:13:28,785
Phoenix, it's on fire.

1030
01:13:28,885 --> 01:13:30,685
Don't start... Throttling up.

1031
01:13:32,085 --> 01:13:33,585
Oh, my God.

1032
01:13:36,585 --> 01:13:38,885
We're on fire! We're on fire!
Damn it!

1033
01:13:38,985 --> 01:13:42,085
<i>Engine fire. Right.
Extinguishing right engine.</i>

1034
01:13:45,085 --> 01:13:46,985
Phoenix, Bob,
punch out, punch out!

1035
01:13:47,085 --> 01:13:49,185
Warning lights everywhere!
Hydraulic failure!

1036
01:13:49,285 --> 01:13:51,285
<i>Flight controls.
I can't control it.</i>

1037
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,885
We're going down, Phoenix!
We're going in! We're going in!

1038
01:13:53,985 --> 01:13:56,685
You can't save it.
Eject, eject!

1039
01:13:56,785 --> 01:13:57,985
Eject, eject, eject!

1040
01:13:58,085 --> 01:14:01,085
<i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

1041
01:14:22,285 --> 01:14:25,385
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob in
the hospital overnight for observation.

1042
01:14:25,485 --> 01:14:27,185
They're gonna be okay.

1043
01:14:31,185 --> 01:14:32,685
That's good.

1044
01:14:35,785 --> 01:14:37,785
I've never lost a wing man.

1045
01:14:38,385 --> 01:14:39,885
You're lucky.

1046
01:14:40,085 --> 01:14:42,085
Fly long enough, it'll happen.

1047
01:14:44,685 --> 01:14:46,685
There will be others.

1048
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,285
Easy for you to say.
No wife.

1049
01:14:53,185 --> 01:14:54,985
No kids.

1050
01:14:55,085 --> 01:14:57,885
Nobody to mourn you
when you burn in.

1051
01:15:01,085 --> 01:15:02,585
Go home.

1052
01:15:03,385 --> 01:15:04,985
Just get some sleep.

1053
01:15:07,185 --> 01:15:09,485
Why'd you pull my papers
at the Academy?

1054
01:15:09,685 --> 01:15:11,585
Why did you stand in my way?

1055
01:15:13,785 --> 01:15:15,185
You weren't ready.

1056
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:16,785
Ready for what?

1057
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:19,885
Huh? Ready to fly like you? No.

1058
01:15:19,985 --> 01:15:21,685
Ready to forget the book.

1059
01:15:21,785 --> 01:15:24,285
Trust your instincts.
Don't think, just do.

1060
01:15:24,385 --> 01:15:27,585
You think up there,
you're dead. Believe me.

1061
01:15:28,585 --> 01:15:30,585
My dad believed in you.

1062
01:15:32,885 --> 01:15:35,685
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake.

1063
01:15:41,185 --> 01:15:42,885
Maverick.

1064
01:15:53,085 --> 01:15:56,185
Ready, aim, fire.

1065
01:16:00,985 --> 01:16:02,085
Ready,

1066
01:16:02,485 --> 01:16:03,785
aim,

1067
01:16:03,985 --> 01:16:05,685
fire.

1068
01:16:15,485 --> 01:16:16,885
Ready,

1069
01:16:17,685 --> 01:16:19,085
aim,

1070
01:16:19,285 --> 01:16:20,685
fire.

1071
01:16:54,085 --> 01:16:57,185
I can only imagine what
you must be feeling right now.

1072
01:16:57,285 --> 01:17:00,585
Take some time.
Whatever you need.

1073
01:17:00,685 --> 01:17:03,185
I appreciate that, sir, but
there is no time. The mission...

1074
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,785
I'll be taking over
the training from here.

1075
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:07,785
Sir?

1076
01:17:08,885 --> 01:17:10,585
We both know you didn't
want this job, Captain.

1077
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:12,985
Sir, they're not ready. It was
your job to get them ready.

1078
01:17:13,185 --> 01:17:16,485
Sir, they have to believe
that this mission can be flown.

1079
01:17:16,585 --> 01:17:19,785
And all you've managed to do
is teach them that it can't.

1080
01:17:20,585 --> 01:17:22,685
Sir... You're grounded, Captain.

1081
01:17:22,785 --> 01:17:24,385
Permanently.

1082
01:17:28,085 --> 01:17:29,885
Sir... That is all.

1083
01:17:48,185 --> 01:17:49,185
I heard.

1084
01:17:51,385 --> 01:17:52,785
I'm sorry.

1085
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:55,185
What are you gonna do?

1086
01:17:56,285 --> 01:17:57,785
Ice is gone.

1087
01:17:59,985 --> 01:18:01,985
What choice do I have?

1088
01:18:02,985 --> 01:18:05,485
You'll have to find a
way back on your own.

1089
01:18:05,585 --> 01:18:07,085
No, Penny.

1090
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:10,185
I'm out.

1091
01:18:11,685 --> 01:18:13,185
This is over.

1092
01:18:13,585 --> 01:18:14,585
Pete.

1093
01:18:14,785 --> 01:18:17,085
If you lost
your wing man up there,

1094
01:18:17,785 --> 01:18:19,485
you'd keep fighting.

1095
01:18:19,685 --> 01:18:21,085
You wouldn't just give up.

1096
01:18:21,685 --> 01:18:23,885
Those are your pilots.

1097
01:18:24,885 --> 01:18:27,685
If anything happens to them,

1098
01:18:27,885 --> 01:18:30,185
you'll never forgive yourself.

1099
01:18:33,985 --> 01:18:36,085
I don't know what to do.

1100
01:18:39,985 --> 01:18:41,785
But you'll find a way.

1101
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,285
I know you will.

1102
01:18:47,185 --> 01:18:49,385
<i>Captain Mitchell
is no longer your instructor.</i>

1103
01:18:49,585 --> 01:18:52,785
And as of today, there are
new mission parameters.

1104
01:18:52,885 --> 01:18:55,285
Time to target
is now four minutes.

1105
01:18:55,385 --> 01:18:57,985
You'll be entering the
valley level at reduced speed.

1106
01:18:58,085 --> 01:19:00,785
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1107
01:19:00,985 --> 01:19:03,685
Sir, won't we be giving
their planes time to intercept?

1108
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:06,485
Well, Lieutenant, you have a
fighting chance against enemy aircraft.

1109
01:19:06,485 --> 01:19:09,485
What are the odds of surviving a
head-on collision with a mountain?

1110
01:19:09,685 --> 01:19:12,385
You'll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude,

1111
01:19:12,485 --> 01:19:13,885
level with the north wall.

1112
01:19:13,985 --> 01:19:16,085
Gonna be a little harder
to keep your lase on target,

1113
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:18,085
but you will avoid
the high-G climb out.

1114
01:19:18,185 --> 01:19:20,785
We'll be sitting ducks
for enemy missiles.

1115
01:19:25,885 --> 01:19:27,385
Who the hell is that?

1116
01:19:28,785 --> 01:19:31,785
<i>Maverick to Range Control.
Entering Point Alpha.</i>

1117
01:19:31,885 --> 01:19:33,885
Confirm green range.

1118
01:19:33,985 --> 01:19:38,085
<i>Uh, Maverick, Range Control,
uh, green range is confirmed.</i>

1119
01:19:38,285 --> 01:19:41,485
<i>I don't see an event scheduled
for you, sir.</i>

1120
01:19:41,585 --> 01:19:43,585
<i>Well, I'm going anyway.</i>

1121
01:19:43,685 --> 01:19:44,885
Nice.

1122
01:19:44,985 --> 01:19:46,785
<i>Setting time to target:</i>

1123
01:19:46,885 --> 01:19:48,685
<i>Two minutes 15 seconds.</i>

1124
01:19:48,785 --> 01:19:50,385
2:15? That's impossible.

1125
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:53,385
Final attack point.
Maverick's inbound.

1126
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:34,285
Popping in three, two, one.

1127
01:22:00,685 --> 01:22:01,885
Bombs away.

1128
01:22:19,585 --> 01:22:22,185
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!

1129
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:24,385
Yes.

1130
01:22:27,085 --> 01:22:28,085
Damn.

1131
01:22:40,785 --> 01:22:43,785
You have put me in a
difficult position, Captain.

1132
01:22:43,885 --> 01:22:47,685
On the one hand, you have demonstrated
that this mission can be flown.

1133
01:22:47,785 --> 01:22:50,485
Perhaps the only way
it can be survived.

1134
01:22:51,585 --> 01:22:52,985
On the other hand,

1135
01:22:53,085 --> 01:22:55,885
you did it by stealing a
multimillion-dollar military aircraft

1136
01:22:55,985 --> 01:22:59,385
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again.

1137
01:23:00,485 --> 01:23:03,385
Iceman is no longer here
to protect you.

1138
01:23:03,585 --> 01:23:06,185
I have everything I need
to have you court-martialed

1139
01:23:06,285 --> 01:23:08,385
and dishonorably discharged.

1140
01:23:08,985 --> 01:23:10,485
So what do I do?

1141
01:23:11,285 --> 01:23:12,385
Risk the lives of my pilots

1142
01:23:12,585 --> 01:23:14,585
and perhaps the success
of this mission

1143
01:23:15,985 --> 01:23:17,185
or...

1144
01:23:18,585 --> 01:23:20,185
risk my career

1145
01:23:21,085 --> 01:23:23,085
by appointing you team leader?

1146
01:23:26,385 --> 01:23:31,085
Sir... I think the admiral's asking
a rhetorical question, Captain.

1147
01:25:11,785 --> 01:25:13,485
Talk to me, Goose.

1148
01:25:16,485 --> 01:25:18,385
Captain Mitchell!

1149
01:25:25,085 --> 01:25:26,885
You're where you belong.

1150
01:25:31,785 --> 01:25:33,385
Make us proud.

1151
01:25:59,285 --> 01:26:01,585
It has been an honor
flying with you.

1152
01:26:02,585 --> 01:26:06,485
Each one of you represents
the best of the best.

1153
01:26:06,685 --> 01:26:09,985
This is a very specific mission.

1154
01:26:10,085 --> 01:26:13,485
My choice is a reflection
of that and nothing more.

1155
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:15,685
Choose your two Foxtrot teams.

1156
01:26:17,085 --> 01:26:18,885
Payback and Fanboy.

1157
01:26:19,885 --> 01:26:21,385
Phoenix and Bob.

1158
01:26:25,385 --> 01:26:27,385
And your wing man.

1159
01:26:31,685 --> 01:26:32,685
Rooster.

1160
01:26:36,885 --> 01:26:39,285
The rest of you will stand by
on the carrier

1161
01:26:39,385 --> 01:26:42,585
for any reserve role
that's required.

1162
01:26:43,185 --> 01:26:44,585
Dismissed.

1163
01:26:51,985 --> 01:26:55,085
Your target
is a clear and present threat.

1164
01:26:56,385 --> 01:27:00,285
<i>A secret uranium enrichment
site under rogue state control.</i>

1165
01:27:00,385 --> 01:27:02,285
<i>It's an underground bunker,</i>

1166
01:27:02,385 --> 01:27:04,485
tucked between
these two mountains.

1167
01:27:05,985 --> 01:27:09,385
<i>Your route of ingress is heavily
defended by surface-to-air missiles</i>

1168
01:27:09,485 --> 01:27:11,785
<i>backed up
by fifth-generation fighters.</i>

1169
01:27:11,985 --> 01:27:14,685
Once your F-18 strike team
crosses the border,

1170
01:27:14,885 --> 01:27:16,785
<i>Tomahawk missiles
from the USS Leyte Gulf</i>

1171
01:27:16,885 --> 01:27:20,785
will launch a synchronized
strike on the enemy's airfield here.

1172
01:27:21,885 --> 01:27:24,385
<i>This will knock out
their runway.</i>

1173
01:27:25,885 --> 01:27:29,085
<i>But you'll have to contend with
any planes already in the air.</i>

1174
01:27:29,185 --> 01:27:32,485
The moment those Tomahawks hit,
the enemy will know you're coming.

1175
01:27:33,485 --> 01:27:34,685
Your time to target

1176
01:27:34,785 --> 01:27:37,685
will be two minutes
and 30 seconds.

1177
01:27:38,985 --> 01:27:40,985
<i>Any longer than that,
and you will be exposed</i>

1178
01:27:41,085 --> 01:27:43,985
<i>to any aircraft
the Tomahawks may have missed.</i>

1179
01:27:47,085 --> 01:27:49,885
This is what you've all
been training for.

1180
01:27:51,585 --> 01:27:53,485
Come home safely.

1181
01:28:07,985 --> 01:28:09,785
You give 'em hell!

1182
01:28:22,285 --> 01:28:23,485
Sir.

1183
01:28:23,885 --> 01:28:24,885
Sir?

1184
01:28:27,085 --> 01:28:28,085
I...

1185
01:28:30,785 --> 01:28:32,785
I just want to say...

1186
01:28:41,685 --> 01:28:43,085
We'll talk

1187
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:45,985
when we get back.

1188
01:28:51,985 --> 01:28:53,885
Hey, Bradley! Bradley!

1189
01:28:54,985 --> 01:28:55,985
Hey.

1190
01:28:59,385 --> 01:29:00,985
You got this.

1191
01:29:09,285 --> 01:29:10,485
<i>Maverick.</i>

1192
01:29:12,985 --> 01:29:13,985
Maverick?

1193
01:29:15,285 --> 01:29:17,485
Hey, you with me?

1194
01:29:18,685 --> 01:29:20,785
I don't like that look, Mav.

1195
01:29:23,385 --> 01:29:25,085
It's the only one I got.

1196
01:29:29,585 --> 01:29:31,085
Thank you.

1197
01:29:32,385 --> 01:29:34,385
If I don't see you again, Hondo,

1198
01:29:34,585 --> 01:29:36,085
thank you.

1199
01:29:43,585 --> 01:29:45,685
It's been an honor, Captain.

1200
01:30:18,585 --> 01:30:21,585
Dagger One,
up and ready on Catapult One.

1201
01:30:21,685 --> 01:30:23,785
Dagger Spare standing by.

1202
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:25,685
Dagger Four, up and ready.

1203
01:30:25,785 --> 01:30:27,285
Dagger Three, up and ready.

1204
01:30:27,485 --> 01:30:29,785
Dagger Two, up and ready.

1205
01:30:30,685 --> 01:30:32,085
Support assets airborne.

1206
01:30:32,185 --> 01:30:33,385
Strike package ready.

1207
01:30:33,485 --> 01:30:35,985
Standing by for launch decision.

1208
01:30:36,085 --> 01:30:37,185
Send them.

1209
01:30:57,585 --> 01:30:59,085
Dagger Two away.

1210
01:31:00,085 --> 01:31:01,985
Dagger Three away.

1211
01:31:02,085 --> 01:31:04,085
Dagger Four away.

1212
01:31:14,885 --> 01:31:17,585
Comanche, Dagger One.
Standby check in.

1213
01:31:18,685 --> 01:31:19,985
<i>Comanche 11, set.</i>

1214
01:31:20,085 --> 01:31:22,485
Picture clean.
Recommend Dagger continue.

1215
01:31:22,585 --> 01:31:24,785
Copy. Daggers descending
below radar.

1216
01:31:44,385 --> 01:31:47,285
Daggers now below radar.
Switching to E-2 picture.

1217
01:31:55,585 --> 01:31:57,985
Here we go.
Enemy territory up ahead.

1218
01:31:58,185 --> 01:32:01,085
Feet dry in 60 seconds.
Comanche, Dagger One. Picture.

1219
01:32:01,185 --> 01:32:04,185
Comanche. Picture clean.
Decision is yours.

1220
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:05,785
Copy.

1221
01:32:13,785 --> 01:32:15,085
Dagger attack.

1222
01:32:19,685 --> 01:32:21,485
Tomahawks airborne.

1223
01:32:21,585 --> 01:32:23,885
No turning back now.

1224
01:32:29,485 --> 01:32:31,785
Daggers,
assume attack formation.

1225
01:32:40,385 --> 01:32:42,285
<i>Daggers set.
Proceeding to target.</i>

1226
01:32:42,485 --> 01:32:47,185
Two minutes and 30 seconds
in three, two, one, mark.

1227
01:32:47,385 --> 01:32:48,585
Two mark.
Three mark.

1228
01:32:48,685 --> 01:32:49,785
Four mark.

1229
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,685
Going in.

1230
01:33:10,985 --> 01:33:13,385
First SAM site overhead.

1231
01:33:17,685 --> 01:33:19,085
Looks like we're clear
on radar, Mav.

1232
01:33:19,185 --> 01:33:21,185
Let's not take it for granted.

1233
01:33:24,585 --> 01:33:26,685
More SAMs! Three o'clock high!

1234
01:33:28,985 --> 01:33:31,185
<i>- We got two minutes to target.
- Copy.</i>

1235
01:33:31,385 --> 01:33:34,385
We're a few seconds behind,
Rooster. We got to move.

1236
01:33:34,485 --> 01:33:38,385
Thirty seconds to Tomahawk
impact on enemy airstrip.

1237
01:33:45,785 --> 01:33:47,385
Dagger, Comanche.

1238
01:33:47,485 --> 01:33:49,785
We're picking up two bandits.
Single group, two contacts.

1239
01:33:49,785 --> 01:33:52,985
Where the hell'd they come
from? Long-range patrol?

1240
01:33:57,785 --> 01:33:59,285
Comanche, what's their heading?

1241
01:33:59,385 --> 01:34:01,485
<i>Bull's-eye 090, 50,
tacked southwest.</i>

1242
01:34:01,685 --> 01:34:03,885
They're headed away from us.
They don't know we're here.

1243
01:34:03,985 --> 01:34:05,885
The second those Tomahawks
hit the air base,

1244
01:34:05,985 --> 01:34:08,085
those bandits are gonna move
to defend the target.

1245
01:34:08,185 --> 01:34:11,085
We have to get there before
they do. Increase speed.

1246
01:34:12,185 --> 01:34:14,885
We got you, Mav.
Don't wait for me.

1247
01:34:20,385 --> 01:34:23,485
Sir, Daggers Two and Four
are behind schedule.

1248
01:34:23,685 --> 01:34:25,985
Time to target, one minute 20.

1249
01:34:26,185 --> 01:34:29,185
Tomahawk impact in three, two...

1250
01:34:33,285 --> 01:34:36,085
Impact.
Enemy runway is destroyed.

1251
01:34:36,785 --> 01:34:38,485
They know we're coming now.

1252
01:34:40,885 --> 01:34:43,885
Bandits are switching course
to defend the target.

1253
01:34:44,085 --> 01:34:45,385
Rooster, where are you?

1254
01:34:46,885 --> 01:34:48,485
<i>Come on, Rooster.
Bandits inbound.</i>

1255
01:34:48,585 --> 01:34:51,185
We got to make up time now.
Let's turn and burn.

1256
01:34:58,885 --> 01:35:00,185
Heads up, Phoenix.

1257
01:35:03,785 --> 01:35:05,085
Whoa!

1258
01:35:09,585 --> 01:35:12,485
Sir, bandits are two minutes
from target.

1259
01:35:12,685 --> 01:35:13,985
Daggers are one minute
from target.

1260
01:35:14,185 --> 01:35:16,785
Come on, Rooster.
Move it or lose it.

1261
01:35:18,585 --> 01:35:21,385
Guys, we're falling behind.
We really gotta move.

1262
01:35:21,485 --> 01:35:23,385
If we don't increase our speed
right now,

1263
01:35:23,485 --> 01:35:26,485
those bandits are gonna be waiting
for us when we reach the target.

1264
01:35:28,285 --> 01:35:29,485
Talk to me, Dad.

1265
01:35:30,685 --> 01:35:32,085
Come on, kid, you can do it.

1266
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:34,485
Don't think, just do.

1267
01:35:42,885 --> 01:35:44,385
Jesus, Rooster, not that fast!

1268
01:35:44,485 --> 01:35:47,185
That's it, kid, that's it.
All right, let's go.

1269
01:35:50,985 --> 01:35:52,485
Damn, Rooster, take it easy.

1270
01:35:52,685 --> 01:35:55,985
Sir, Dagger Two is reengaging.

1271
01:35:56,085 --> 01:35:58,785
All right, now hit your target
and come home.

1272
01:36:02,885 --> 01:36:05,385
Thirty seconds to target.
Bob, check your laser.

1273
01:36:05,585 --> 01:36:09,285
Air-to-ground check complete.
Laser code verified, 1688.

1274
01:36:09,485 --> 01:36:10,585
<i>Laser is a go!</i>

1275
01:36:12,785 --> 01:36:14,285
Watch your heads.

1276
01:36:15,885 --> 01:36:17,185
Holy shit! Shit!

1277
01:36:17,285 --> 01:36:19,485
Payback, you with me?
Right behind you.

1278
01:36:20,285 --> 01:36:22,085
Phoenix, stand by
for pop-up strike.

1279
01:36:22,285 --> 01:36:23,885
Dagger Three in position.

1280
01:36:24,685 --> 01:36:27,185
Popping in three, two, one.

1281
01:36:54,985 --> 01:36:57,485
Get me eyes on that
target, Bob. Dagger Three.

1282
01:36:58,485 --> 01:37:00,285
<i>Stand by, Mav.
Come on, Bob, come on.</i>

1283
01:37:00,485 --> 01:37:02,285
Stand by.

1284
01:37:02,385 --> 01:37:05,485
I've got it. Captured!
Target acquired. Bombs away.

1285
01:37:26,285 --> 01:37:29,685
We've got impact!
Check, direct hit! Direct hit!

1286
01:37:29,885 --> 01:37:31,685
That's miracle number one.

1287
01:37:32,285 --> 01:37:33,685
Dagger Two, status.

1288
01:37:33,885 --> 01:37:35,485
Almost there, Mav. Almost there.

1289
01:37:37,985 --> 01:37:39,385
Fanboy, where's my laser?

1290
01:37:39,485 --> 01:37:42,185
Rooster, there's something wrong
with this laser!

1291
01:37:42,285 --> 01:37:43,785
Shit! Dead eye, dead eye, dead eye!

1292
01:37:43,985 --> 01:37:46,285
Come on, guys, we're
running out of time. Get it online!

1293
01:37:46,385 --> 01:37:47,885
<i>I'm trying!
Come on, Fanboy!</i>

1294
01:37:48,085 --> 01:37:49,985
Nearly there! Nearly there!

1295
01:37:58,885 --> 01:38:01,185
Come on, Fanboy, get it online.
There's no time. I'm dropping blind.

1296
01:38:01,185 --> 01:38:03,285
Rooster, I got this!
No time. Pull up.

1297
01:38:03,485 --> 01:38:05,585
- Wait!
- Bombs away! Bombs away!

1298
01:38:18,185 --> 01:38:20,485
Bull's-eye, bull's-eye,
bull's-eye!

1299
01:38:24,285 --> 01:38:25,385
Miracle number two.

1300
01:38:25,585 --> 01:38:27,185
Now they're in Coffin Corner.

1301
01:38:27,285 --> 01:38:29,585
We're not out of this yet.

1302
01:38:31,485 --> 01:38:32,985
Here it comes.

1303
01:38:35,585 --> 01:38:37,885
Radar warning! Smoke in
the air. Phoenix, break right.

1304
01:38:37,985 --> 01:38:40,185
Emergency jettison.
Dagger Three defending.

1305
01:38:40,285 --> 01:38:42,085
Here comes another one!

1306
01:38:42,185 --> 01:38:44,185
Dagger One defending.

1307
01:38:50,185 --> 01:38:51,485
Rooster, status.

1308
01:38:59,685 --> 01:39:00,685
Oh, my God.

1309
01:39:02,585 --> 01:39:04,385
Smoke in the air!
Smoke in the air!

1310
01:39:05,485 --> 01:39:07,585
Break right, Payback!
Breaking right.

1311
01:39:08,685 --> 01:39:10,685
Oh, my God, here they come!

1312
01:39:10,785 --> 01:39:12,385
SAM on your six, Rooster!

1313
01:39:13,685 --> 01:39:15,185
Deploying countermeasures.

1314
01:39:17,885 --> 01:39:19,485
Negative contact.

1315
01:39:21,285 --> 01:39:22,585
Dagger One defending.

1316
01:39:23,685 --> 01:39:26,585
Talk to me, Bob. Break right,
Phoenix! Break right! Mav!

1317
01:39:26,685 --> 01:39:28,485
<i>Nine o'clock! Nine o'clock!</i>

1318
01:39:29,585 --> 01:39:31,085
<i>Rooster, two more on your six.</i>

1319
01:39:31,185 --> 01:39:32,785
Dagger Two, defending.

1320
01:39:37,185 --> 01:39:39,385
Payback, SAM on your nose.
Dagger Four defending.

1321
01:39:39,585 --> 01:39:41,285
Rooster, tally, seven o'clock!
Talk to me, Bob!

1322
01:39:41,285 --> 01:39:42,585
On our six!
Dagger Two defending.

1323
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:44,285
<i>- Phoenix, break right!
- I see it!</i>

1324
01:39:51,885 --> 01:39:53,385
Dagger Two defending.

1325
01:39:54,485 --> 01:39:55,685
Shit, I'm out of flares!

1326
01:39:55,885 --> 01:39:57,885
Rooster, evade, evade!

1327
01:39:57,985 --> 01:40:00,685
I can't shake 'em!
They're on me! They're on me!

1328
01:40:10,685 --> 01:40:12,485
Mav! No!

1329
01:40:14,185 --> 01:40:17,785
Dagger One is hit!
I repeat, Dagger One is hit!

1330
01:40:17,885 --> 01:40:19,185
<i>Maverick is down.</i>

1331
01:40:19,385 --> 01:40:20,585
<i>Dagger One, status.</i>

1332
01:40:20,785 --> 01:40:22,185
<i>Status!</i>

1333
01:40:22,285 --> 01:40:24,385
<i>Anyone see him?
Does anyone see him?</i>

1334
01:40:24,485 --> 01:40:26,785
Dagger One, come in!
I didn't see a parachute.

1335
01:40:26,985 --> 01:40:28,385
We have to circle back.

1336
01:40:28,485 --> 01:40:31,085
Comanche. Bandits inbound.
Single group, hot.

1337
01:40:31,185 --> 01:40:32,885
Recommend Dagger flow south.

1338
01:40:33,885 --> 01:40:35,685
<i>One minute to intercept.</i>

1339
01:40:38,685 --> 01:40:41,885
Get 'em back to the carrier
now. All Daggers flow to ECP.

1340
01:40:41,985 --> 01:40:44,085
<i>You have bandits headed
for you. What about Maverick?</i>

1341
01:40:44,085 --> 01:40:46,885
Tell him there's nothing he can do
for Maverick, not in a goddamn F-18.

1342
01:40:47,085 --> 01:40:50,385
Dagger Spare request permission
to launch and fly air cover.

1343
01:40:52,385 --> 01:40:53,685
Negative, Spare.

1344
01:40:54,485 --> 01:40:55,585
Launch search and rescue.

1345
01:40:55,685 --> 01:40:57,185
Negative.
Not with bandits in the air.

1346
01:40:57,185 --> 01:40:58,585
But, sir,
Maverick is still out there.

1347
01:40:58,585 --> 01:41:00,885
We are not losing
anyone else today.

1348
01:41:02,785 --> 01:41:04,085
Get 'em home now.

1349
01:41:04,285 --> 01:41:06,885
Dagger, you are not to engage.

1350
01:41:06,985 --> 01:41:08,785
Repeat, do not engage.

1351
01:41:08,885 --> 01:41:12,085
<i>Dagger Two, return to carrier.
Acknowledge.</i>

1352
01:41:12,285 --> 01:41:13,285
<i>Acknowledge.</i>

1353
01:41:13,385 --> 01:41:15,685
Rooster,
those bandits are closing.

1354
01:41:15,785 --> 01:41:16,785
We can't go back.

1355
01:41:16,985 --> 01:41:19,885
Rooster, he's gone.

1356
01:41:21,385 --> 01:41:23,185
<i>Maverick's gone.</i>

1357
01:42:53,385 --> 01:42:54,585
Oh, no, no.

1358
01:43:00,885 --> 01:43:02,785
<i>Dagger Two is hit.</i>

1359
01:43:03,885 --> 01:43:04,985
Dagger Two is hit.

1360
01:43:06,385 --> 01:43:08,285
Dagger Two, come in.

1361
01:43:09,485 --> 01:43:11,585
Dagger Two, do you copy?

1362
01:43:12,485 --> 01:43:14,585
<i>Dagger Two, come in.</i>

1363
01:43:39,785 --> 01:43:40,785
You all right?

1364
01:43:40,785 --> 01:43:42,685
Yeah, I'm good.
You all right?

1365
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:47,085
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

1366
01:43:47,285 --> 01:43:49,485
What am I doing here?
You think I took that missile

1367
01:43:49,585 --> 01:43:51,085
so you could be
down here with me?

1368
01:43:51,285 --> 01:43:52,985
You should be back
on the carrier by now!

1369
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:54,685
I saved your life!

1370
01:43:54,785 --> 01:43:57,785
I saved your life.
That's the whole point.

1371
01:43:57,985 --> 01:43:59,885
What the hell
were you even thinking?

1372
01:44:00,085 --> 01:44:02,385
You told me not to think!

1373
01:44:18,885 --> 01:44:19,985
Well,

1374
01:44:21,385 --> 01:44:22,685
it's good to see you.

1375
01:44:25,185 --> 01:44:26,785
It's good to see you too.

1376
01:44:30,585 --> 01:44:32,385
So what's the plan?

1377
01:44:43,285 --> 01:44:44,685
You're not serious.

1378
01:44:59,685 --> 01:45:01,785
You've got to be shitting me.

1379
01:45:03,785 --> 01:45:05,185
An F-14?

1380
01:45:05,385 --> 01:45:06,885
I shot down three MiGs
in one of those.

1381
01:45:07,085 --> 01:45:09,785
We don't even know
if that bag of ass can fly.

1382
01:45:12,385 --> 01:45:14,585
Let's find out.
Mav!

1383
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:17,485
Okay.

1384
01:45:26,685 --> 01:45:29,785
There's guys up there, Mav.
Yeah.

1385
01:45:29,885 --> 01:45:32,885
- There's more over there.
- Okay.

1386
01:45:32,985 --> 01:45:35,585
- Let's start running.
- Yeah, run. Run.

1387
01:45:44,785 --> 01:45:47,685
Once... Once I give you
the signal for air,

1388
01:45:47,785 --> 01:45:50,485
you're gonna flip this switch
until the needle gets to 120.

1389
01:45:50,585 --> 01:45:51,985
When the engine starts,

1390
01:45:52,085 --> 01:45:54,385
you got to pull out the pins
and disconnect everything.

1391
01:45:54,485 --> 01:45:56,185
You understand?
Yeah.

1392
01:45:58,385 --> 01:45:59,585
Yes!

1393
01:46:01,285 --> 01:46:03,685
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.

1394
01:46:11,385 --> 01:46:13,685
Okay. Wow.

1395
01:46:14,585 --> 01:46:16,685
It's been a minute, huh, Mav?

1396
01:46:45,085 --> 01:46:48,485
Oh, my God.
This thing is so old.

1397
01:46:49,285 --> 01:46:50,485
All right.

1398
01:46:55,385 --> 01:46:56,985
Canopy?
Clear.

1399
01:47:15,185 --> 01:47:17,485
Both runways are cratered.

1400
01:47:17,685 --> 01:47:19,985
How we gonna get this
museum piece in the air?

1401
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:31,785
Why are the wings
coming out, Mav?

1402
01:47:38,085 --> 01:47:40,785
Mav, this is a taxiway,
not a runway.

1403
01:47:40,885 --> 01:47:44,385
This is a very short
taxiway, Mav.

1404
01:47:44,485 --> 01:47:45,985
Just hang on.

1405
01:47:47,185 --> 01:47:48,685
Holy shit!

1406
01:47:54,485 --> 01:47:55,685
Come on, come on, come on.

1407
01:47:55,785 --> 01:47:57,785
Needle's alive. Come on.

1408
01:48:00,185 --> 01:48:02,485
Mav?
That's it. Come on, come on!

1409
01:48:02,685 --> 01:48:03,885
All right.

1410
01:48:04,585 --> 01:48:06,885
Mav!
Here we go.

1411
01:48:08,185 --> 01:48:09,785
Holy shit.

1412
01:48:23,185 --> 01:48:26,385
Sir, we're receiving a signal
from Rooster's ESAT.

1413
01:48:26,485 --> 01:48:28,385
But there seems to be
a malfunction.

1414
01:48:28,485 --> 01:48:29,985
Have you lost him?
No, sir.

1415
01:48:30,885 --> 01:48:32,285
He's supersonic.

1416
01:48:32,885 --> 01:48:34,085
He's airborne.

1417
01:48:35,285 --> 01:48:37,185
In what?
Sir.

1418
01:48:37,285 --> 01:48:41,885
Over watch reports an F-14 Tomcat is
airborne and on course for our position.

1419
01:48:42,685 --> 01:48:45,285
Can't be. It can't be!

1420
01:48:47,085 --> 01:48:48,085
Maverick.

1421
01:48:50,085 --> 01:48:52,485
Okay, Rooster,
get us in touch with the boat.

1422
01:48:52,585 --> 01:48:54,085
I'm working on it.

1423
01:48:54,185 --> 01:48:57,285
Radio's out. No radar.
Everything's dead back here.

1424
01:48:57,485 --> 01:49:00,585
What do I do? Talk me
through it. Okay, first the radio.

1425
01:49:00,685 --> 01:49:02,585
Throw the, uh...

1426
01:49:02,685 --> 01:49:05,885
The UHF-2 circuit breaker.
Try that.

1427
01:49:05,985 --> 01:49:08,885
There's 300 breakers back here.
Anything more specific?

1428
01:49:08,985 --> 01:49:11,085
I don't know.
That was your dad's department.

1429
01:49:11,285 --> 01:49:12,885
I'll figure it out.

1430
01:49:15,885 --> 01:49:18,285
Mav, tally two, 5:00 low.

1431
01:49:23,485 --> 01:49:24,785
What do we do?

1432
01:49:25,485 --> 01:49:27,385
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

1433
01:49:27,485 --> 01:49:30,185
If they knew who we were,
we'd be dead already.

1434
01:49:31,785 --> 01:49:33,685
Well, here they come.

1435
01:49:33,785 --> 01:49:37,085
What's your plan?
Just put your mask on.

1436
01:49:38,085 --> 01:49:40,785
Remember,
we're on the same team.

1437
01:49:43,285 --> 01:49:45,185
Just wave and smile.

1438
01:49:45,785 --> 01:49:47,385
<i>Just wave and smile.</i>

1439
01:49:54,285 --> 01:49:55,985
What's that signal?
What's he saying?

1440
01:49:56,185 --> 01:49:59,685
No idea.
I have no idea what he's saying.

1441
01:49:59,785 --> 01:50:03,685
What about that one? Any idea?
No, never seen that one either.

1442
01:50:06,585 --> 01:50:10,785
Oh, shit. His wing man is moving
into weapons envelope.

1443
01:50:11,485 --> 01:50:12,985
All right, listen up.

1444
01:50:13,085 --> 01:50:15,685
When I tell you, you grab
those rings above your head.

1445
01:50:15,785 --> 01:50:17,485
That's the ejection handle.

1446
01:50:18,385 --> 01:50:20,885
<i>Mav, can we outrun these guys?</i>

1447
01:50:21,585 --> 01:50:23,685
Not their missiles and guns.

1448
01:50:27,985 --> 01:50:29,885
Then it's a dogfight.

1449
01:50:29,985 --> 01:50:33,185
An F-14 against
fifth-gen fighters?

1450
01:50:34,385 --> 01:50:36,985
It's not the plane,
it's the pilot.

1451
01:50:38,185 --> 01:50:40,385
You'd go after 'em
if I wasn't here.

1452
01:50:40,885 --> 01:50:42,885
But you are here.

1453
01:50:43,485 --> 01:50:44,985
Come on, Mav.

1454
01:50:45,885 --> 01:50:47,185
Don't think.

1455
01:50:48,385 --> 01:50:49,485
Just do.

1456
01:51:04,885 --> 01:51:07,185
Tell me when you see
smoke in the air.

1457
01:51:11,185 --> 01:51:13,685
Smoke in the air!
Smoke in the air! Hang on.

1458
01:51:16,185 --> 01:51:18,985
Yeah, Mav! Splash one!
Splash one!

1459
01:51:23,985 --> 01:51:26,085
Here comes another one.

1460
01:51:28,585 --> 01:51:30,885
Rooster, flares!
Now, now, now!

1461
01:51:33,985 --> 01:51:35,385
Splitting the throttles.

1462
01:51:37,485 --> 01:51:38,785
Coming around.

1463
01:51:42,885 --> 01:51:44,485
Give me tone, give me tone.

1464
01:51:44,585 --> 01:51:47,185
You got him, Mav! You
got him! Taking the shot.

1465
01:51:53,185 --> 01:51:54,385
What the...

1466
01:51:55,185 --> 01:51:57,485
Holy shit!
What the fuck was that?

1467
01:51:58,785 --> 01:52:00,985
Hang on. We gotta get low.

1468
01:52:01,085 --> 01:52:03,785
The terrain will confuse
his targeting system.

1469
01:52:05,585 --> 01:52:06,785
Here he comes!

1470
01:52:19,185 --> 01:52:21,085
Talk to me, Rooster.
Where is he?

1471
01:52:21,185 --> 01:52:23,185
He's still on us!

1472
01:52:30,085 --> 01:52:32,385
We took a hit! We took a hit!
Damn it!

1473
01:52:37,185 --> 01:52:39,685
Come on, Mav. Do some of
that pilot shit. Brace yourself.

1474
01:52:50,385 --> 01:52:51,385
Holy shit.

1475
01:52:58,185 --> 01:53:00,285
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1476
01:53:04,685 --> 01:53:06,085
Damn it!

1477
01:53:06,885 --> 01:53:09,885
Out of missiles.
Switching to guns.

1478
01:53:15,485 --> 01:53:16,885
Come on, Mav, come on.

1479
01:53:19,185 --> 01:53:21,085
You got him, Mav!
It's not over yet.

1480
01:53:25,485 --> 01:53:27,585
One last chance.
You can do this.

1481
01:53:28,685 --> 01:53:30,585
Come on, Maverick.

1482
01:53:39,885 --> 01:53:42,085
Yes! Splash two!

1483
01:53:52,885 --> 01:53:54,585
Mav, I got the radio on.
Outstanding.

1484
01:53:54,685 --> 01:53:56,785
Get us in touch with
the boat. Copy that.

1485
01:53:58,985 --> 01:54:00,385
Oh, my God.

1486
01:54:02,185 --> 01:54:04,185
Where the hell is this guy?

1487
01:54:05,185 --> 01:54:07,085
He's on our nose.

1488
01:54:09,485 --> 01:54:11,585
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

1489
01:54:13,485 --> 01:54:16,185
Smoke in the air!
Rooster, flares!

1490
01:54:18,585 --> 01:54:19,985
That was close.

1491
01:54:22,185 --> 01:54:24,285
We're out of flares, Mav.

1492
01:54:28,285 --> 01:54:30,485
Shit, he's already on us.

1493
01:54:34,685 --> 01:54:37,085
This is not good.

1494
01:54:44,985 --> 01:54:47,185
We took another hit!
No, no, no, no, no!

1495
01:54:51,785 --> 01:54:53,985
We can't take much more of this.

1496
01:54:54,085 --> 01:54:55,885
We can't outrun this guy.
We got to eject.

1497
01:54:55,985 --> 01:54:57,285
What?
We need altitude.

1498
01:54:57,385 --> 01:54:59,385
Pull the ejection handles
the second I tell you.

1499
01:54:59,585 --> 01:55:01,685
Mav, wait! Rooster,
there's no other way.

1500
01:55:04,885 --> 01:55:06,285
Eject, eject, eject!

1501
01:55:06,385 --> 01:55:09,185
Rooster, pull the handle!
Eject!

1502
01:55:09,285 --> 01:55:11,185
It's not working!

1503
01:55:21,085 --> 01:55:24,285
Mav!

1504
01:55:25,285 --> 01:55:26,985
I'm sorry.

1505
01:55:28,085 --> 01:55:29,985
I'm sorry, Goose.

1506
01:55:42,285 --> 01:55:44,085
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1507
01:55:44,285 --> 01:55:46,285
This is your savior speaking.

1508
01:55:46,385 --> 01:55:48,185
<i>Please fasten your seat belts,</i>

1509
01:55:48,285 --> 01:55:50,885
<i>return your tray tables to their
locked and upright positions...</i>

1510
01:55:52,085 --> 01:55:54,485
<i>...and prepare for landing.</i>

1511
01:55:56,785 --> 01:55:58,885
Hey, Hangman, you look good.

1512
01:55:58,985 --> 01:56:02,485
I am good, Rooster.
I'm very good.

1513
01:56:04,185 --> 01:56:06,185
<i>I'll see you back on deck.</i>

1514
01:56:27,685 --> 01:56:30,285
Maverick is downwind.
No front landing gear.

1515
01:56:30,385 --> 01:56:32,585
No tail hook. Pull the cable
and raise the barricade.

1516
01:56:32,785 --> 01:56:35,285
Foul deck! Foul deck!
Raise the barricade!

1517
01:56:36,085 --> 01:56:37,585
Go!

1518
01:56:59,785 --> 01:57:02,085
Please don't tell me
we lost an engine.

1519
01:57:02,185 --> 01:57:05,085
All right, I won't
tell you that. Okay.

1520
01:57:29,085 --> 01:57:30,085
You good?

1521
01:57:30,285 --> 01:57:32,185
Yeah. I'm good.

1522
01:58:17,485 --> 01:58:20,385
Chalked yourself another
kill. That makes two.

1523
01:58:20,985 --> 01:58:22,185
Mav has five.

1524
01:58:22,285 --> 01:58:23,785
Makes him an ace.

1525
01:58:41,785 --> 01:58:44,285
Captain Mitchell!
Captain Mitchell!

1526
01:58:50,985 --> 01:58:52,385
Sir.

1527
01:58:59,685 --> 01:59:01,585
Thank you for saving my life.

1528
01:59:02,685 --> 01:59:04,785
It's what my dad would've done.

1529
01:59:43,985 --> 01:59:45,185
Hey, Mav.

1530
01:59:46,085 --> 01:59:47,385
Jimmy.

1531
01:59:48,285 --> 01:59:49,485
Is, uh...

1532
01:59:50,185 --> 01:59:51,585
Is Penny around?

1533
01:59:51,685 --> 01:59:55,285
Uh, she took Amelia
on a sailing trip.

1534
01:59:57,585 --> 01:59:59,685
Did she say when she'd be back?

1535
01:59:59,885 --> 02:00:01,685
You know, she didn't.

1536
02:00:03,885 --> 02:00:05,685
Can I get you anything?

1537
02:00:18,885 --> 02:00:19,985
Get in there.

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
