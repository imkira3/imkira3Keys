00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:24,030
<i>So, I know
what you're thinking.</i>

4
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:26,432
<i>Why is that incredibly
handsome hedgehog</i>

5
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:27,766
<i>being chased by a madman</i>

6
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:29,835
<i>with a mustache
from the Civil War?</i>

7
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:33,905
<i>Well, to be honest, it feels like
I've been running my whole life.</i>

8
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,342
<i>Is this too much?
Am I going too fast?</i>

9
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:39,479
<i>It's kind of what I do...
You know what? Let's back up.</i>

10
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:50,189
<i>This is the island
where I'm from.</i>

11
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:52,225
<i>It had everything.</i>

12
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:54,760
<i>Sandy beaches,
cascading waterfalls,</i>

13
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:56,728
<i>public access to loop-de-loops.</i>

14
00:01:56,862 --> 00:01:58,663
<i>And, I never had
to catch a school bus</i>

15
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:01,134
<i>because I could run across
the entire island</i>

16
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:02,834
<i>in less than two seconds.</i>

17
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,703
<i>Also, there was no school.</i>

18
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:07,173
<i>I know,
pretty sweet island, right?</i>

19
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:09,008
Yeah!

20
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:11,044
<i>I was born
with extraordinary powers</i>

21
00:02:11,177 --> 00:02:12,778
<i>and was told
to keep them secret.</i>

22
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:15,547
<i>And like any kid,
I did the exact opposite.</i>

23
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,983
Whoo-hoo!

24
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:20,819
<i>That's Longclaw.
She took care of me.</i>

25
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:22,989
<i>She was basically
Obi-Wan Kenobi...</i>

26
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:25,458
<i>if Obi-Wan Kenobi
had a beak and ate mice.</i>

27
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,161
Sonic, someone
could have seen you.

28
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:30,762
No one saw me. I'm too fast!

29
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:32,965
And I wanted to bring you this.

30
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,204
Get down!

31
00:02:41,673 --> 00:02:43,042
<i>Turns out,
with great power</i>

32
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:45,278
<i>comes great
power-hungry bad guys.</i>

33
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:47,646
<i>And I led them right to us.</i>

34
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,663
Listen carefully, Sonic.

35
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:07,699
You have a power unlike
anything I have ever seen.

36
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,036
And that means someone
will always want it.

37
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,173
The only way to stay safe
is to stay hidden.

38
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,246
This world is on the far side
of the universe.

39
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:21,547
You should be safe there.

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,217
- I don't want to go without you.
- You must.

41
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,953
These rings will be your most
important possession.

42
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:33,493
If you're ever discovered,
use one.

43
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,162
Never stop running.

44
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,197
Now go!

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,169
Longclaw!

46
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:45,605
Goodbye, Sonic.

47
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:46,771
No!

48
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:50,775
No!

49
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:18,137
Come on, one car?

50
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:29,282
I'm bored.

51
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,716
<i>Tom, do you read me?
Are you there?</i>

52
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,154
No, Wade, I'm actually
on a yacht in Barbados.

53
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:37,256
With Rihanna.

54
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,723
OMG.

55
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:40,459
That's amazing.
Please send pics.

56
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:42,361
No, Wade.
I'm at the speed trap.

57
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:45,764
Already? How did you get back so fast?
Barbados is in the ocean!

58
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:47,934
Hang on, I think
I got something.

59
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,809
Hey, buddy! Where's the fire?

60
00:04:57,944 --> 00:04:59,946
Got kids living around here.

61
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:01,846
I thought that was
kind of funny.

62
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:03,482
Sorry.

63
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:10,990
What?

64
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:51,497
<i>Tom,
we need you down on Main Street.</i>

65
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,633
<i>There's been a violent
gang shoot-out.</i>

66
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:58,471
<i>Just kidding.
A duck stole a bagel.</i>

67
00:05:58,604 --> 00:06:00,905
<i>But they do need it back.</i>

68
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:14,287
Whoa, buddy, you almost
got yourself killed out there.

69
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,389
What are you,
some kind of adrenaline junkie?

70
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:18,724
It must be rough
being slow all the time.

71
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:22,028
Tell you what.
Today is your lucky day.

72
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,532
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

73
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,168
Have you ever felt so alive?

74
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:32,804
This is great.
You're doing amazing.

75
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:34,540
Oh, geez!

76
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:36,875
Good recovery.

77
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,211
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

78
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:41,813
Let's keep this our little secret, okay?

79
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:45,017
You never saw me.
I was never here.

80
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:01,067
<i>So what
were you expecting?</i>

81
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,069
<i>A dirty little hedgehog
eating berries</i>

82
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:05,204
<i>and struggling to survive?</i>

83
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:09,809
<i>Think again. Because I am
living my best life on Earth.</i>

84
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:11,910
<i>I've got a library...</i>

85
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:14,580
<i>a home gym,</i>

86
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:17,516
<i>and a state-of-the-art
security system.</i>

87
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:30,996
Oh, no.

88
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:33,332
<i>And, if I'm ever discovered,</i>

89
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,067
<i>I'll follow
Longclaw's instructions</i>

90
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:38,371
<i>and use my rings
to escape to a new planet.</i>

91
00:07:38,504 --> 00:07:42,641
<i>A nice, safe little world
filled only with mushrooms.</i>

92
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:47,113
<i>Gross, smelly mushrooms.</i>

93
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,615
I hate mushrooms.

94
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:52,884
<i>But let's not worry
about all that.</i>

95
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:55,254
<i>This is Green Hills.</i>

96
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:57,590
<i>The greatest place on Earth.</i>

97
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:01,127
<i>These are my people and,
dare I say,</i>

98
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,529
<i>I am their
lovable space creature.</i>

99
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:06,399
<i>So what if they
don't know I exist?</i>

100
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:11,103
<i>My favorite person
is the Donut Lord.</i>

101
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:13,939
<i>Protector of this town</i>

102
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:17,209
<i>and defender of all creatures,
big and small.</i>

103
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:18,110
Morning.

104
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:20,246
Donald. Daisy. Daffy.

105
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:24,183
<i>Donut Lord lives
with Pretzel Lady.</i>

106
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:25,917
<i>She is super nice to animals</i>

107
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:29,555
<i>and strangely was born
without bones.</i>

108
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:31,023
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

109
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:32,858
<i>There is one person in town</i>

110
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:34,260
<i>who's actually onto me.</i>

111
00:08:34,393 --> 00:08:36,695
<i>He calls me the blue devil.</i>

112
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:38,664
I almost caught him last night.

113
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:40,599
<i>Say hello to Crazy Carl.</i>

114
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:45,971
<i>We have fun together.</i>

115
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,875
I know you're out there!

116
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,878
And I know you're real!

117
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:55,581
No, I'm not!

118
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:57,516
<i>Movie night is my favorite.</i>

119
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,319
Please, please,
please, please, please.

120
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:01,754
Yes! Keanu!

121
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:03,322
You are a national treasure.

122
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,891
- <i>When I find you...</i>
- <i>Pop quiz, hotshot.</i>

123
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,760
<i>There's a bomb on a bus.</i>

124
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:09,728
"Pop quiz, hotshot."

125
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:11,430
It's a classic line.

126
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:14,166
<i>Basically,
we're like a family.</i>

127
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,068
<i>Even though we haven't met yet.</i>

128
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,070
You don't zink your

129
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:20,739
prolonged isolation is making
you a bit crazy perhaps?

130
00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:22,741
Crazy? Me?

131
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,311
No way, Doc.
You got me all wrong.

132
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:29,648
And despite all these so-called
friends of yours, deep down...

133
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:32,251
...you're still rather lonely?

134
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,260
<i>Perhaps afraid
you'll be alone forever?</i>

135
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:58,979
Uh-uh. Hey!
No, no, no, no.

136
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:00,746
Get out of there. Come on.

137
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,082
Oh, come on! Get out of there!

138
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:05,784
Get out of there,
you trash pandas.

139
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:09,788
Maddie, as Green Hills'
most respected veterinarian,

140
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:13,092
what is the fastest way
to exterminate a raccoon?

141
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:15,728
Hi, Ozzy. Hello!
You're glad to see me.

142
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:17,229
You don't eat garbage, do you?

143
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:19,532
What's that?

144
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:23,102
- Is that what I think it is?
- Uh-huh. Open it.

145
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:25,037
Oh, it's kind of small.
Is that bad?

146
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,172
Just open it.

147
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:33,479
"Dear Thomas:

- Wow.

Oh, my God.

155
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:48,060
Ta-da!

00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:52,598
Oh!

158
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:53,766
Wrong one!

159
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:57,903
Ta-da!

160
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:01,774
- You never had a doubt, huh?
- No! Mm-mmm.

161
00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:07,346
- I can't believe this.
- Oh, I know! You did it.

162
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:10,449
Hey, what are those?

163
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,652
Apartments for rent
I found on Zillow.

164
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:16,255
I thought Ozzy and I
could fly there tomorrow

165
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:19,391
and check out
some neighborhoods.

166
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:22,261
I mean,
this is all happening so fast.

167
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:25,065
Oh, man...
It's the craziest thing.

168
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:27,333
You apply for the job,
you get the job.

169
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:29,002
Well, pending
a background check.

170
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:31,071
Oh, man.
Hope they don't find out about

171
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:33,539
that time you used
the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

172
00:11:33,672 --> 00:11:35,774
Correction: I'm still using
the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

173
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:38,143
But, Maddie,

174
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:39,778
are you sure
you're okay with this?

175
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:41,680
Thomas Michael Wachowski,

176
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,216
what did you do the entire time
I was in veterinary school?

177
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,819
I worked a second job
to pay the rent and...

178
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:48,654
A third job to pay tuition.

179
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:52,458
You sacrificed for me.
I'm happy to sacrifice for you.

180
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,428
Babe, are you sure
you're okay with this?

181
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:59,865
I mean, there's been
a Wachowski protecting this town

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,167
for more than 50 years.

183
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:04,536
This is a big change.

184
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:07,306
I'm positive.

185
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:10,242
It's time for this guy to
get out there and prove himself.

186
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:12,244
I love Green Hills, but,

187
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:14,014
you know, I want to help
people in real trouble.

188
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:17,449
I want someone to turn to me
in a life-and-death situation

189
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,318
and I'll be there for 'em.

190
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:21,186
I get it.

191
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,423
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

192
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:25,491
Mmm!

193
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:27,292
And so it is with a heavy heart,

194
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:29,428
that I tell you all
that I've accepted a position

195
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:31,363
at the San Francisco
Police Department,

196
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:33,198
effective immediately.

197
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:35,101
It's gonna be tough
to leave my hometown

198
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,902
and all my friendships.

199
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:40,806
But this is something
I feel like I need to do...

200
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,274
to grow...

201
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:46,245
as both an officer and a man.

202
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:50,549
What do you think,
Sergeant Sprinkles?

203
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,352
That wasn't so bad, right?

204
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:56,388
Now all I got to do is...

205
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:58,992
tell everyone
who isn't a donut.

206
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,362
Whoa, the playoffs!

207
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:49,641
Oh! So cool.

208
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:55,481
Bottom of the ninth,
tie score.

209
00:13:55,614 --> 00:13:57,183
And exactly who you want
at the plate

210
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:59,185
with the game
on the line: Sonic!

211
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:00,886
But staring him down
from the pitcher's mound

212
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,323
is the most fearsome southpaw
in Green Hills:

213
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:05,691
Also Sonic.

214
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:07,893
Okay. Focus, Sonic.
If you win this game,

215
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:10,662
you'll be the most beloved kid
in Green Hills.

216
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:18,570
Hit it to the guy in left!
He's a real space case.

217
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,408
I can't with that guy.

218
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:25,011
Hey, batter Sonic.
Hey, batter Sonic.

219
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:27,880
"Suh-wing," batter Sonic.

220
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:36,889
I got it, I got it, I got it!

221
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,324
I don't got it.

222
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:50,069
Go home! Go home!

223
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:51,938
Come on!

224
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:57,910
Safe!

225
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:02,748
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes! I did it!

226
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:05,952
Did you see that?
I did it. I did it.

227
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:21,000
I really am alone.

228
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:24,436
All alone. Forever.

229
00:15:58,403 --> 00:16:01,941
I'm sure no one noticed that
giant blue explosion, right?

230
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:13,619
- Hey, Wade.
- Hi, Tom.

231
00:16:13,752 --> 00:16:15,454
Uh, Wade here.

232
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:17,257
What is going on?

233
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:18,690
Well, gosh,
I think the power's out.

234
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:20,626
Yeah, no dur!
The lights are out.

235
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,594
The whole town is freaking out.

236
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:24,663
- What should I do?
- <i>Okay, relax.</i>

237
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:26,598
Take a deep breath, call Gil,

238
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:29,335
see if they can locate
the downed line, then...

239
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:32,338
call Zim and see if he can get
his generator over to the Super Q

240
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:33,639
so the food stays... fresh.

241
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:37,509
<i>Call Zim before Gil?</i>

242
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:39,946
- <i>Call Gil... Hello?</i>
- I'll call you back.

243
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,382
Wait! Hello? Was that
the end of the instructions?

244
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:46,785
Okay, all right.
Uh, you can do this.

245
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,024
What was the first thing
he said to do?

246
00:16:52,524 --> 00:16:54,826
Right. Relax.

247
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:16,715
Twenty minutes ago,
an energy surge

248
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:19,451
knocked out power across
the entire Pacific Northwest.

249
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:20,752
What do we know?

250
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:23,722
Well, our first instinct
was it was an EMP.

251
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:26,591
But electromagnetic pulses
don't have that kind of power.

252
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:29,128
NASA has ruled out
meteor strikes or solar flares.

253
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:31,730
The Department of Energy says it's
not a power plant malfunction.

254
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:33,333
Well, sounds like
we're really good

255
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:34,700
at figuring out
what it wasn't.

256
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,003
This could be a prelude
to a larger attack.

257
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:39,238
I'm suggesting we scramble
the Fifth and Sixth Regiment.

258
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:40,539
No, no, no, no.

259
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:43,042
This needs a much more
sophisticated mind.

260
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:44,944
Someone who
understands technology.

261
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:48,014
- You want to send in a lab rat?
- Not just any lab rat.

262
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:49,282
A lab rat with teeth.

263
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:51,683
You're not suggesting
who I think you're suggesting.

264
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:53,552
- I know, he's a little weird.
- Weird?

265
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:56,055
- No. No way.
- He's a psychological tire fire!

266
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:59,658
But he's also brilliant.
Five PhDs, IQ off the charts.

267
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,462
And his drone tech
is revolutionary!

268
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:04,430
You're sure he can handle this?

269
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,432
He has a perfect
operations record.

270
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:08,434
- Remember the coup in Pakistan?
- No.

271
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:09,868
Or the uprising
in Azerbaijanistan?

272
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:12,005
- That's not even a country.
- Exactly.

273
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:14,240
And you can thank
Robotnik for that.

274
00:18:14,374 --> 00:18:17,609
I can't believe you're
bringing that freak into this.

275
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:20,246
Neither can I, but...

276
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:22,415
we have no choice.

277
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:49,042
What the...

278
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:12,432
Are you in charge here?

279
00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:13,632
- Yes, I am...
- Nope!

280
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:14,633
- My...
- Wrong!

281
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,169
- name...
- I'm in charge!

282
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:17,503
- is Major...
- Me!

283
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:19,905
- Ben...
- I'm in charge.

284
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:22,975
You've never seen
anything like this before.

285
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:24,944
It says
I'm the top banana

286
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:27,679
in a world full of
hungry little monkeys.

287
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:30,049
Allow me to clarify.

288
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:31,517
In a sequentially
ranked hierarchy

289
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,918
based on level
of critical importance,

290
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:35,021
the disparity between us
is too vast to quantify.

291
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:37,523
- Agent Stone?
- The Doctor thinks you're basic.

292
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:39,658
I'm initiating a sweep sequence.

293
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,395
Ten miles in every direction
should suffice.

294
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,932
- Is he still looking at me funny?
- Yes, he is.

295
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,766
Tell him to stop or I'll
pull up his search history.

296
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:49,601
If you don't stop looking
at the Doctor,

297
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:51,204
- he'll take a closer look...
- I'm not deaf.

298
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:53,106
And tell him his men
report to me now.

299
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:54,407
Blah-blah-blah.

300
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,076
Excuse me? Listen, pal,
I don't know if you realize...

301
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,212
I'm sorry, Major.
What was your name?

302
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:01,713
- Benning...
- Nobody cares!

303
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:05,184
Nobody cares. Listen,
Major Nobody Cares.

304
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:07,487
You know why
nobody cares who you are?

305
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:10,056
Because nobody cares about
your feeble accomplishments.

306
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:13,025
And nobody cares
how proud your mommy is

307
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:15,694
that you're now reading
at a third-grade level.

308
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:17,930
- Mmm.
- Have you finished <i>Charlotte's Web</i> yet?

309
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:20,199
Spoiler alert:
She dies in the end.

310
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,502
But she leaves
a big creepy egg sac.

311
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:26,973
Ah... my babies.

312
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:30,042
Whoo! Look what came out
of my egg sac.

313
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:32,945
You know what I love
about machines?

314
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:36,616
They do what they're told.
They follow their programming.

315
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:38,817
They don't need time off
to get drunk

316
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:40,685
and put the boat in the water.

317
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:42,421
Now you do what you're told.

318
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:45,558
Stand over there on the edge
of your personal abyss...

319
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:48,827
and watch my machines
do your job.

320
00:20:51,197 --> 00:20:53,698
- Can you feel it, Stone?
- I can feel it, Doctor.

321
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:57,136
It's evolution, Stone.

322
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,770
It's evolution!

323
00:21:34,574 --> 00:21:36,609
- Agent Stone?
- Doctor.

324
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:38,877
Do you see anything useful
in this image?

325
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,415
- Nothing at all, Doctor.
- Of course you don't.

326
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:44,584
Your eyes weren't
expertly trained to spot tracks

327
00:21:44,716 --> 00:21:47,320
by the Native-American
Shadow Wolves.

328
00:21:57,363 --> 00:21:58,397
That's extraordinary.

329
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:01,100
No. What's extraordinary is,

330
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:03,102
I've determined
the exact height, weight

331
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:04,803
and spinal curvature
of this creature,

332
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:07,273
and my computer
can't find a single match for it

333
00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:10,276
anywhere in Earth's
animal kingdom.

334
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,446
This blackout
was not a terrorist attack,

335
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:15,648
and that's no baby bigfoot.

336
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,418
This guy is something else...

337
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,154
entirely.

338
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:25,291
Divert all search units
to the site of the footprint.

339
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:28,594
That's one small step for man,

340
00:22:28,728 --> 00:22:31,197
one giant leap for me.

341
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:44,110
Okay, okay, everything is fine.

342
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:46,245
You played some baseball,
got a little upset,

343
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:49,582
lightning shot out of your butt,
and now they're coming for you.

344
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,618
All right, all right.
Earth isn't safe anymore.

345
00:22:52,752 --> 00:22:54,420
Time for plan B.
Mushroomville.

346
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:57,323
But I gotta take my stuff.
Okay, essential items only.

347
00:22:57,456 --> 00:22:59,858
Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste,
hair gel, night-light.

348
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:01,961
Funny hat.
This half-eaten cantaloupe.

349
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:03,929
Oh, and my scented candle.

350
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:06,065
My entire comic book collection.
Bean bag chair.

351
00:23:06,198 --> 00:23:07,799
Can a bean bag chair
fit in a backpack?

352
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:09,535
No, no, no. Of course not.
That's stupid.

353
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:13,939
Okay, what else? The rings!
The rings, yes, of course.

354
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:16,175
Here we go. Ring time.

355
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:18,810
Mushroom planet, here I come.

356
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:20,179
Oh, no.
They're right outside.

357
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:23,316
I gotta go somewhere else.

358
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:28,554
Goodbye, cave.

359
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,293
- Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

360
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:35,294
Whatcha doing?

361
00:23:35,428 --> 00:23:37,829
Just coloring
with Jojo and Rachel.

362
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:39,965
Ah, that sounds...
half-fun.

363
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:42,168
Hey, exciting stuff here.
We had a power outage.

364
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:44,136
The whole town went dark.

365
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,472
It was like a sign telling me
to get out of Dodge.

366
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:48,774
- Wade must have lost his mind.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

367
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:51,177
And he does not
have much to lose.

368
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,746
How's your sister?
Did she convince you to leave me yet?

369
00:23:53,912 --> 00:23:57,216
No, but she did tell me to check
your phone for dating apps.

370
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,352
<i>The only apps on my phone
are the ones that came with it.</i>

371
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:01,387
- And the Olive Garden.
- <i>Ah.</i>

372
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,422
- Because when you're there...
- You're family.

373
00:24:05,857 --> 00:24:07,326
No way.

374
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:10,930
The raccoons are back.

375
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:12,897
And they are in for a surprise.

376
00:24:13,032 --> 00:24:15,501
Your surprise better not be
my tranquilizer gun.

377
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:16,569
They're just hungry.

378
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:19,939
<i>And also, that's for bears.</i>

379
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:22,241
- Good. Now I know it'll work.
- <i>Tom!</i>

380
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,610
I'm kidding. I'm just gonna
use it to scare 'em.

381
00:24:24,744 --> 00:24:25,877
Possibly to death.

382
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:27,279
- <i>Love you, honey, bye!</i>
- Tom...

383
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:34,487
D-I-V-O-R-C-E.

384
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:38,057
Okay, I'm in.

385
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,060
With minimal damage
to Donut Lord's property.

386
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:42,962
Here we go.

387
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:44,296
It didn't work out on Earth,
but that's okay.

388
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,798
You're going to a safe world.

389
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:48,267
A nice, safe world
full of mushrooms.

390
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:51,670
Mushrooms that'll be
your only friends.

391
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:53,472
That sounds awful.
I can't do this.

392
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:56,075
You have to do it.
There's no other option.

393
00:24:56,842 --> 00:24:59,145
All right.

394
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:02,815
SFPD...
pending background check.

395
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:04,583
Paws in the air!

396
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:08,788
Uh, meow?

397
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:15,561
Ow!

398
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:20,533
"San... Francisco?"

399
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:45,257
No.

400
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:50,329
What?

401
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:14,386
The blue devil.

402
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,702
- Donut Lord?
- It can talk.

403
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:31,303
You're not...

404
00:26:31,437 --> 00:26:32,705
You're not here
to abduct me, are you?

405
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:34,406
You abducted me.

406
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:37,910
Okay, that's a fair point.
What are you?

407
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,845
Why are you hiding out
in my garage?

408
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,380
I needed somewhere safe.

409
00:26:41,514 --> 00:26:43,549
And you're the only person
I could think of, Donut Lord.

410
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:45,050
Why do you keep
calling me Donut Lord?

411
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:46,418
'Cause you talk to donuts.

412
00:26:46,552 --> 00:26:48,654
And then eat them
if they get out of line.

413
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:50,022
Again, fair.

414
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:51,257
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are all the mushrooms?

415
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,959
Why am I still on Earth?
What is...

416
00:26:53,092 --> 00:26:55,794
Oh, no!
I lost my rings.

417
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:57,096
What?

418
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:05,638
What's happening?
Is this your mother ship?

419
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:07,706
I'm not in the mood
to get probed.

420
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,709
You think you're worried?
I'm not even wearing pants.

421
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:16,215
What the...

422
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:19,251
- They're coming for me!
- Who's coming for you?

423
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:21,287
- What's that got to do with me?
- I don't have time to explain,

424
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,555
but you have to help me.

425
00:27:22,688 --> 00:27:24,490
No, I don't. Why?

426
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:27,092
Well, my legs,
which normally would be classified

427
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:29,328
as lethal weapons,
feel like spaghetti.

428
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:32,531
I need your help. Please.
It's life or death.

429
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:42,141
Fine. Come with me.

430
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,845
Uh, little help?

431
00:27:58,058 --> 00:27:59,926
All right, stay here.
And be quiet.

432
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,193
Good plan. Great plan!

433
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:02,595
We're already working
so well together.

434
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:05,531
Practically finishing
each other's sentences.

435
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:08,133
Okay, bye.

436
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:12,705
Hello there!

437
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:14,707
Can I help you?

438
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,879
Good morning,
my rural chum.

439
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:24,683
I'm... from the power company,
investigating the blackout.

440
00:28:24,817 --> 00:28:26,685
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take a few readings

441
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:28,153
inside your house?

442
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:29,755
No kidding?
You're from the power company?

443
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:31,457
- Mmm.
- Oh, you must know my buddy Spencer.

444
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,560
- We play softball together.
- Ah! Spence.

445
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:37,196
He's a good man.

446
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:40,000
- Yeah. Come on in!
- Great.

447
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:41,567
Take all the readings you need.

448
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,335
Except, uh...

449
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:46,338
Doesn't the power company usually take
their readings from outside the house?

450
00:28:46,472 --> 00:28:49,174
That way they can check them
even if you're not home.

451
00:28:49,308 --> 00:28:51,510
Also, my buddy Spencer
works for the gas company,

452
00:28:51,644 --> 00:28:53,245
and he's more of
an Ultimate Frisbee guy.

453
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:56,016
So you want to tell me
why you think I'm dumb enough

454
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:57,816
to just let you
walk inside my house?

455
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,861
- I'm sorry, Mister...
- Wachowski.

456
00:29:08,995 --> 00:29:10,629
But everyone calls me Tom.

457
00:29:10,763 --> 00:29:12,598
Except my dentist,
he calls me Tim.

458
00:29:12,731 --> 00:29:14,199
But it's gone on
for so long now

459
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,301
that it would just be weird
if I corrected him.

460
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:18,537
Well, Tom, whose-dentist-
calls-him-Tim.

461
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:20,572
You may have noticed
that this entire town

462
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:22,374
has been experiencing
a power outage.

463
00:29:22,508 --> 00:29:24,276
Yep, no lights.
Picked up on that.

464
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,446
Twenty minutes ago, I tracked an
energy pulse with a similar signature

465
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:29,848
to the one that caused
that disruption.

466
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:46,632
Listen, uh, Mister...

467
00:29:46,765 --> 00:29:47,800
Doctor.

468
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:50,803
Dr. Robotnik.
But my dentist calls me Rob.

469
00:29:50,937 --> 00:29:52,438
Hmm.

470
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:55,808
Look, uh, Dr. Robotskeez.

471
00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:58,144
Um, I'm sure what you're
here for is very serious,

472
00:29:58,277 --> 00:29:59,511
but it's got nothing
to do with me.

473
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:01,014
You can ask anyone in town.

474
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:03,049
- Everyone knows me.
- I bet they do.

475
00:30:03,183 --> 00:30:04,416
I'm sure you're hella popular

476
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,318
with the Jebs and Merles
and Billy Bobs,

477
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:08,854
in this glorified
gas-station rest stop.

478
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:11,223
Betcha go way back
to the days of tippin' cows

479
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:13,225
and playin' in a jug band!

480
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:18,932
And maybe someday
you'll achieve your goal

481
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:21,734
of getting a Costco card
or adopting a Labradoodle.

482
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:24,204
But the reality is,
I surpassed

483
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:27,773
everything you're
ever going to do...

484
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:30,977
before I was a toddler.

485
00:30:31,111 --> 00:30:34,913
I was spitting out formulas while
you were still spitting up formula.

486
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:36,281
I was breastfed,
actually.

487
00:30:36,415 --> 00:30:39,651
Nice.
Rub that in my orphan face.

488
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:42,488
Mr. Wachowski,
are you familiar with

489
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:46,226
US Code 904,
Title 10, Article 104?

490
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:48,694
- Yeah, who isn't...
- "Anyone...

491
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:52,664
who attempts to aid an enemy of the
United States shall suffer death."

492
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:56,335
And if I'm the one
that catches you,

493
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:57,870
it'll be even worse.

494
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:01,107
Worse than death?

495
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:04,743
Okay, I'm a ball,
a normal ball.

496
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:06,345
I'm blending in like a ball.

497
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:07,746
Shh. Stop talking.
No, <i>you</i> stop talking.

498
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,748
Be quiet, Sonic.
<i>You</i> be quiet, Sonic.

499
00:31:09,882 --> 00:31:12,484
Oh, I hope they aren't
scanning me with X-rays.

500
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:14,653
I had kind of
an embarrassing lunch.

501
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:24,763
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.

502
00:31:24,897 --> 00:31:27,633
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.

503
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:30,335
I'm freaking out!

504
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:34,207
Why don't you have
your staircase carpeted?

505
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:36,441
Compared to what I...

506
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:40,445
- Old pipes.
- Yeah.

507
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:42,081
Probably just
the house settling.

508
00:31:42,215 --> 00:31:43,983
Nothing to see here!

509
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:46,418
Hey!

510
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:53,026
Here's the thing.

511
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:56,428
I'm never wrong.

512
00:31:56,562 --> 00:31:59,032
Well, first time
for everything, I guess.

513
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:00,399
Would you like some cake?

514
00:32:00,532 --> 00:32:01,834
I hear raccoons have
the cleanest mouths

515
00:32:01,968 --> 00:32:03,869
of any animal that
routinely eats garbage.

516
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:17,984
Look at that.

517
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:20,286
I was right.

518
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:22,554
Note the lack of surprise.

519
00:32:22,688 --> 00:32:24,356
Shall we try this again?

520
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:38,171
I'm going to give you five
seconds to tell me where it is.

521
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:39,438
Five...

522
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:40,639
I don't know what
you're talking about.

523
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:41,807
- Four.
- Hey, tough guy. I'm a cop,

524
00:32:41,941 --> 00:32:43,408
and you're
threatening an officer.

525
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:45,711
How can you threaten somebody
who never existed?

526
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:47,113
Three...

527
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:48,847
Come on!
Rack your brain.

528
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:51,284
You might be able to come up
with some lame excuse

529
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,987
to go on living
in two...

530
00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:56,022
one.

531
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:58,091
Wait! Don't hurt him!

532
00:33:12,071 --> 00:33:13,739
This feels excessive.

533
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:18,577
Stay behind me.

534
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,558
Hiya!

535
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,930
Don't worry. I got it
right where I want it!

536
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:43,002
Can you believe Amazon is gonna
deliver packages with these things?

537
00:33:45,537 --> 00:33:48,573
This was a horrible plan!
What was I thinking?

538
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:52,511
I'm gonna puke!

539
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:59,018
Come on!
We gotta get out of here.

540
00:33:59,152 --> 00:34:01,220
Oh, don't tell me
that's all you got!

541
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:02,721
I'm just getting started!

542
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:05,091
Let me know if you want to go
round two with the blue.

543
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:26,611
Doctor! Are you okay?

544
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:29,215
I saw a guy race out of here
and thought...

545
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:31,150
That you should
stop them?

546
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:33,618
Open your mouth...

547
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:35,620
and say you thought that you
should stop them.

548
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:37,457
No, I thought that maybe
I should check

549
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:39,225
to see if you were okay...

550
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,860
You know what's hard about being
the smartest person in the world?

551
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:45,264
- Everyone else seems stupid.
- Stupid, yes! Way to go!

552
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:46,732
You got that one.

553
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:51,938
Whatever this creature is,
it's our job to secure it,

554
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:56,142
neutralize it,
uncover the source of its power.

555
00:34:56,275 --> 00:34:57,843
And if it resists,

556
00:34:58,643 --> 00:35:00,113
we take it apart...

557
00:35:00,746 --> 00:35:02,581
piece by piece.

558
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:05,218
See what makes it tick.

559
00:35:06,486 --> 00:35:07,686
- Stone?
- Doctor?

560
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:10,189
Call Optical Illusions.

561
00:35:10,323 --> 00:35:12,458
Tell them I need new frames.

562
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:14,593
They know what kind I like.

563
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:17,230
Oh, and bring that quill.

564
00:35:18,364 --> 00:35:19,831
Yes, Doctor.

565
00:35:22,768 --> 00:35:23,936
All right, pal,

566
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,570
you need to start talking
right now.

567
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:27,974
Who are you? What are you?

568
00:35:28,107 --> 00:35:30,742
I'm a hedgehog!
I feel like that's obvious.

569
00:35:30,876 --> 00:35:33,446
- And I'm in big trouble.
- Oh, <i>you're</i> in big trouble?

570
00:35:33,578 --> 00:35:35,982
You're not the one who punched some
sort of government weirdo back there.

571
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:38,884
You think <i>you</i> have problems?
I lost my rings.

572
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:40,453
Rings?
What are you talking about?

573
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:43,056
Okay. Rings are how
all advanced cultures

574
00:35:43,189 --> 00:35:44,524
travel between worlds.

575
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:46,959
And now mine are
on top of a pointy building

576
00:35:47,093 --> 00:35:50,530
- I've only ever seen on your skintight T-shirt.
- Hey.

577
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:52,564
So, I'd like you to take me
to San Francisco,

578
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:54,467
so I can get back my rings
and use them

579
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,135
to go to the mushroom planet.

580
00:35:57,569 --> 00:35:59,805
- Mushroom planet.
- Yes!

581
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:01,773
Right.

582
00:36:05,211 --> 00:36:07,846
- Okay, pal, out you go.
- I'm sorry, what?

583
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,848
Look, this is
the worst possible time

584
00:36:09,982 --> 00:36:11,817
for me to get myself
into trouble, okay?

585
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:13,986
You asked me to save your life,
I saved your life.

586
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,190
Now, please, go find your rings.
And your mushroom land.

587
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:18,991
Hopefully I'm gonna wake up
in a hospital bed

588
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:21,094
and the doctor's gonna tell me
that my colonoscopy

589
00:36:21,227 --> 00:36:23,362
was a big success, okay?
So goodbye.

590
00:36:23,496 --> 00:36:26,731
- Okay. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

591
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:31,736
- Why aren't you leaving?
- I don't know where San Francisco is.

592
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,871
- It's west.
- West?

593
00:36:33,005 --> 00:36:34,207
Straight shot, can't miss it.

594
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,408
Fine. That's cool.

595
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,609
I'm totally cool
saying goodbye now.

596
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:46,552
So, as I crashed into the cold,
dark water of the Pacific,

597
00:36:46,685 --> 00:36:48,920
I realized a few things.

598
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:51,424
A, I have no idea
where I'm going.

599
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:53,493
B, saltwater stings.

600
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:58,197
C, I shouldn't even be on
this planet right now, but I am.

601
00:36:58,331 --> 00:37:00,166
Why? Because you shot me!

602
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:01,968
- I know.
- You shot me!

603
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,668
All right, I heard you
the first time.

604
00:37:03,802 --> 00:37:06,372
You don't have to pile it on.
Good grief.

605
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:09,342
I'm wet. I'm cold.

606
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:11,110
There's a fish on my head!

607
00:37:11,244 --> 00:37:14,846
And clearly, I'm not gonna
be able to do this on my own.

608
00:37:19,185 --> 00:37:21,786
All right,
get in the truck.

609
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,589
Really? You're gonna help me?

610
00:37:23,722 --> 00:37:26,192
I guess it is a little bit my fault
that all this is happening to you.

611
00:37:26,325 --> 00:37:29,362
Not a little bit. Entirely.
It is entirely your fault.

612
00:37:29,495 --> 00:37:31,998
Okay, it's entirely my fault.
Are you coming?

613
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:33,199
Yes.

614
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:36,902
Road trip! Whoop-whoop!

615
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:38,971
What am I doing?

616
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:41,641
All right, there's
gonna be rules on this trip.

617
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,577
Number one, do exactly
as I say all the time.

618
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:46,711
- Got it?
- Got it, Donut Lord.

619
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:49,282
Would you stop
with the "Donut Lord"?

620
00:37:49,415 --> 00:37:51,117
I have a name. It's Tom.

621
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:52,518
I'm Sonic.

622
00:37:52,652 --> 00:37:55,154
Sonic. Sonic.

623
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:58,690
So you've been
spying on us all for years.

624
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:00,159
I wouldn't call it "spying."

625
00:38:00,293 --> 00:38:02,761
We were all just hanging out,
only I wasn't invited

626
00:38:02,894 --> 00:38:04,197
and no one knew I was there.

627
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,599
I can't believe Crazy Carl
was right all this time.

628
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:09,936
Yeah. You should call him
Super Observant Carl instead.

629
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:12,972
- Oh, my God, stop the car right now!
- What? What?

630
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:15,374
The World's Largest
Rubberband Ball?

631
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:17,410
- We gotta see it!
- No. No.

632
00:38:17,543 --> 00:38:20,213
No, this is not some
fun family road trip, okay?

633
00:38:20,346 --> 00:38:22,448
The government wants
to dissect you.

634
00:38:22,582 --> 00:38:24,350
And arrest me. This is serious.

635
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,186
Eh, you're right, it was lame.

636
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,788
Gift shop was cool, though.
I got you a mouse pad.

637
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:31,591
When are we gonna get there?

638
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:34,026
We will get there
when we get there.

639
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:55,715
I'm gonna go check in with Wade,
see if he knows what's going on.

640
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:58,184
You're gonna see Wade
in that glass thing?

641
00:38:58,317 --> 00:39:00,386
What is it, a teleportation box?

642
00:39:02,088 --> 00:39:03,956
It's a pay phone.
It's mostly for drug dealers

643
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,459
and fugitives from the law,
which is us.

644
00:39:06,592 --> 00:39:08,427
Stay in the car.
I don't want anybody seeing you.

645
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:10,762
Fine.

646
00:39:21,474 --> 00:39:22,341
Huh?

647
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:31,783
Okay, okay.
That is the coolest place on Earth,

648
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:33,953
but you have to stay in the car.

649
00:39:43,562 --> 00:39:45,931
Be strong. Be strong.

650
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:49,935
Hmm.

651
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:54,873
Hello.
Green Hills Police Department.

652
00:39:55,007 --> 00:39:56,742
- Wade, it's me.
- <i>Hi.</i>

653
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,144
I'm so glad that you called.

654
00:39:58,277 --> 00:40:00,845
Uh, so, some guys came in
asking some questions.

655
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,481
Uh, they're a little creepy.

656
00:40:02,615 --> 00:40:05,251
Kind of reminded me of
the guys from <i>Men in Black,</i>

657
00:40:05,384 --> 00:40:08,754
but not as likable
or charming as Will Smith.

658
00:40:08,887 --> 00:40:10,156
Wait, what kind of questions?

659
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:13,426
Um, questions about terrorism?

660
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:16,796
I told them that I've gone
ice fishing with Tom.

661
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:18,197
He doesn't know how
to make a bomb.

662
00:40:18,331 --> 00:40:20,566
<i>He can't even
make bait in the cold.</i>

663
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,802
All right, Wade, listen to me.
This is really important.

664
00:40:22,935 --> 00:40:24,570
Don't tell them
that we talked, okay?

665
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:30,276
You know, I think
they already know.

666
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:34,846
Mr. Wachowski.

667
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:36,282
Tom.

668
00:40:36,415 --> 00:40:37,950
I want you to know
that the only other person

669
00:40:38,084 --> 00:40:41,153
who ever punched me in the face
was the school bully.

670
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:43,855
He hit me in the cafeteria,
causing a blunt-force contusion

671
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:46,425
to the soft tissue
surrounding my orbital bone.

672
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,728
Humiliated me in front of
the entire school!

673
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,463
And do you know
what I did in response?

674
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:53,499
Uh, I'm assuming that you reported
him to the principal's office

675
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:55,501
'cause that kind of behavior
is really unacceptable.

676
00:40:55,634 --> 00:40:58,971
No. I examined the inefficiency of
a world where brawn trumped brain

677
00:40:59,105 --> 00:41:02,007
and I used technology
to resolve that inefficiency.

678
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:05,144
The boy ate his meals
through a straw for a year.

679
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:07,279
And I have never
lost a fight again.

680
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,614
Until today.

681
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:10,282
Hey, hooray for me then, huh?

682
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:13,152
No, because you're about to
become the bully with the straw!

683
00:41:13,285 --> 00:41:15,887
I'm coming for you,
Mr. Wachowski.

684
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:17,556
And when I catch you, I'll...

685
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:19,891
Hello.

686
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:21,293
Hello?

687
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:22,762
Hello, hello, hello?

688
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:24,363
I think he actually hung up,

689
00:41:24,497 --> 00:41:26,031
because I notice
that the light isn't on.

690
00:41:26,165 --> 00:41:27,500
Thank you, Officer Brainfart.

691
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:29,869
If you give me a second,
I can get an outside line.

692
00:41:30,002 --> 00:41:32,104
No. Don't be bothered.

693
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:35,141
You just sit there and be "u"...

694
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:37,410
...'seless.

695
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,153
No one's gonna
erase my memory here?

696
00:41:48,087 --> 00:41:50,222
I will tell people about this!

697
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:56,562
Okay, not exactly
the healthiest meal, but...

698
00:41:57,563 --> 00:41:58,631
Sonic?

699
00:42:02,735 --> 00:42:04,203
Oh, no.

700
00:42:04,737 --> 00:42:06,472
No, no, no, no, no!

701
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:12,845
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

702
00:42:21,253 --> 00:42:22,555
Howdy, pardner!

703
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:24,123
I'm not your partner.
Come on. We're leaving.

704
00:42:24,256 --> 00:42:25,858
But there's a ZZ Top cover band.

705
00:42:25,991 --> 00:42:27,593
You gotta see their beards.

706
00:42:27,726 --> 00:42:29,428
You're gonna have to catch 'em
some other time. Let's go. Get up!

707
00:42:29,562 --> 00:42:32,665
If we stay, I won't say another
word for the rest of the trip,

708
00:42:32,798 --> 00:42:34,467
starting... now.

709
00:42:35,668 --> 00:42:37,938
Welcome to the Piston Pit.
What can I get you fellas?

710
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,239
I want nachos and buffalo wings,
oh, and guac.

711
00:42:40,372 --> 00:42:42,808
Funny word, isn't it?
Guac, guac! Guac.

712
00:42:42,943 --> 00:42:44,343
Hey, no kids
allowed in here.

713
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:45,946
What's he got on,
some kind of mask?

714
00:42:46,078 --> 00:42:49,482
Oh, he's actually
43 years old and, um,

715
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:51,517
suffers from
a very rare skin disease

716
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:56,021
that stunts his growth and makes him
look, uh, like that.

717
00:42:56,155 --> 00:42:57,323
The face,
I was born with.

718
00:42:57,456 --> 00:42:59,825
The confidence,
I picked up along the way.

719
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,963
- Make his a Mello Yello, please.
- Okay.

720
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,765
- You owe me one.
- I never sat on a barstool before.

721
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:08,200
So squishy!

722
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:10,236
Oh, look at this.
It spins.

723
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:11,938
- Yes.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

724
00:43:12,071 --> 00:43:13,873
- That's nice.
- I feel sick.

725
00:43:14,006 --> 00:43:15,241
Are you having fun?

726
00:43:15,374 --> 00:43:16,909
Gonna check this off
the ol' bucket list, huh?

727
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:18,979
- Big night for you.
- What's a bucket list?

728
00:43:19,111 --> 00:43:21,714
A bucket list is, uh...

729
00:43:21,847 --> 00:43:24,450
It's a list of things
you want to do in your life

730
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:27,019
before you, well,
kick the bucket.

731
00:43:27,152 --> 00:43:28,787
I've never
kicked a bucket, either!

732
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:30,723
Oh, I gotta make my list.

733
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:34,793
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

734
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:37,263
Oh, Sonic!

735
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:39,331
Uh-huh.

736
00:43:44,103 --> 00:43:45,271
What? What's the matter?

737
00:43:45,404 --> 00:43:47,606
There's so much stuff
I've never done.

738
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,276
And now that I'm
leaving Earth forever,

739
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:51,810
I guess I missed my chance.

740
00:43:57,816 --> 00:43:59,518
Well, I guess
this is the kind of place

741
00:43:59,652 --> 00:44:02,721
you could get a lot of living
done in a short period of time.

742
00:44:03,355 --> 00:44:04,490
I suppose we can spare an hour.

743
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:07,192
What? You're gonna
bucket-list with me?

744
00:44:07,326 --> 00:44:10,129
- Sure, why not?
- You won't regret this.

745
00:44:10,262 --> 00:44:11,597
Oh, I'm pretty sure I will.

746
00:44:35,788 --> 00:44:37,756
New high score!

747
00:44:40,092 --> 00:44:41,794
Yippee-ki-yay!

748
00:44:42,227 --> 00:44:43,395
Ah-ha!

749
00:44:43,529 --> 00:44:45,431
Wait a second,
is this bull missing a head

750
00:44:45,564 --> 00:44:47,466
or does it have two butts?

751
00:44:49,368 --> 00:44:51,637
This is easy.

752
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:54,607
- Okay.
- Ha-ha! Yeehaw!

753
00:44:57,376 --> 00:44:58,877
I'm a cowboy, baby!

754
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:03,816
I'm okay.

755
00:45:06,285 --> 00:45:08,554
Whoo!

756
00:45:09,355 --> 00:45:11,057
Whoo! Yeah!

757
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,192
Ha-ha-ha!

758
00:45:13,325 --> 00:45:14,493
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.

759
00:45:14,627 --> 00:45:16,161
Nice work, Romeo.

760
00:45:16,295 --> 00:45:18,098
Glad you're having a good time.

761
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,598
I am having a good time!

762
00:45:19,732 --> 00:45:22,768
I'm having the best time.
I mean, what could go wrong?

763
00:45:24,803 --> 00:45:26,205
Uh...

764
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:28,240
Can we help you?

765
00:45:28,374 --> 00:45:30,010
We don't like
your kind around here.

766
00:45:30,142 --> 00:45:32,344
Our kind?
What kind is that?

767
00:45:34,213 --> 00:45:35,447
Hipsters.

768
00:45:35,581 --> 00:45:37,483
- How dare you.
- Oh, hey. You know what?

769
00:45:37,616 --> 00:45:38,952
We were leaving anyway.
Weren't we?

770
00:45:39,085 --> 00:45:41,487
- There's not a problem here.
- No, no, no, it's okay.

771
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,821
No, no, no,
we're leaving.

772
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:45,224
I know exactly
how to handle this situation.

773
00:45:45,357 --> 00:45:47,793
Pop quiz, hotshot.

774
00:45:47,927 --> 00:45:50,329
You just picked a fight with
a poorly disguised hedgehog

775
00:45:50,462 --> 00:45:52,498
who's seen way too many
action movies.

776
00:45:52,631 --> 00:45:55,101
What do you do? What do you do?

777
00:45:56,635 --> 00:45:59,538
Huh. Am I crazy?
It's supposed to break, right?

778
00:45:59,672 --> 00:46:02,541
Dink! Dink-dink!
Break, please. Break, please.

779
00:46:02,675 --> 00:46:04,077
Break this bottle, please.

780
00:46:04,209 --> 00:46:05,511
- Please, please, please.
- Uh, Sonic?

781
00:46:06,512 --> 00:46:07,947
Uh-oh!

782
00:46:16,122 --> 00:46:18,490
- Oh-ho-ho-ho!
- Nice going!

783
00:46:18,624 --> 00:46:20,526
Thanks! It's awesome right?

784
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:22,095
All right, who's next?
Who wants some?

785
00:46:22,227 --> 00:46:23,963
Who do I get to beat up?

786
00:46:24,797 --> 00:46:26,632
Hey! Has anybody
seen my waitress?

787
00:46:26,765 --> 00:46:28,935
Still waiting on
those buffalo wings.

788
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:31,670
Why, you!

789
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,709
Ha-ha-ha!

790
00:46:38,178 --> 00:46:40,146
Uh-oh!

791
00:46:42,848 --> 00:46:43,849
Really?

792
00:48:15,674 --> 00:48:17,676
<i>Olé!</i>

793
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:35,861
- So, should we get out of here?
- Yeah, time to go.

794
00:48:36,495 --> 00:48:39,265
That was amazing!

795
00:48:39,398 --> 00:48:40,967
Wait a second.
Did we even pay our tab?

796
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,434
It doesn't matter!

797
00:48:42,568 --> 00:48:44,703
Watch this, watch this.
I always wanted to do this.

798
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:50,843
- Get 'em!
- See ya, suckers!

799
00:48:50,977 --> 00:48:54,546
I can't say for sure,
but I think they liked me.

800
00:48:55,581 --> 00:48:57,416
Come on!
Don't let 'em get away!

801
00:48:59,085 --> 00:49:01,087
- Oh, yes!
- Yeah!

802
00:49:01,221 --> 00:49:02,421
- Yes!
- Ouch!

803
00:49:02,554 --> 00:49:03,622
He got you pretty good.

804
00:49:03,755 --> 00:49:04,958
I'm all right.
I've been hit harder.

805
00:49:05,091 --> 00:49:07,093
Did you see how much
toilet paper I used?

806
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:10,596
The next person that goes into that
bathroom will have nothing to wipe with!

807
00:49:11,463 --> 00:49:13,565
The floors were sticky.
The crowd was rough.

808
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:15,101
And the odds
were against us.

809
00:49:15,235 --> 00:49:18,537
But there was no stopping
Donut Lord and the Blue Blur.

810
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:20,873
Scratch another one
off my list.

811
00:49:22,242 --> 00:49:24,710
You are a weird little dude.

812
00:49:32,718 --> 00:49:33,652
Mmm.

813
00:49:33,785 --> 00:49:34,686
Mmm.

814
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,888
Mmm.

815
00:49:36,022 --> 00:49:36,822
Mmm.

816
00:49:36,956 --> 00:49:37,623
Okay.

817
00:49:37,756 --> 00:49:39,391
So what are we gonna do now?

818
00:49:40,893 --> 00:49:43,930
I'm gonna pass out watching TV.
I think you should too.

819
00:49:44,063 --> 00:49:45,631
But this is my
last night on Earth.

820
00:49:45,764 --> 00:49:47,300
I want to soak up
every last second.

821
00:49:47,432 --> 00:49:49,568
All right, well, anything you
can find to do in this room,

822
00:49:49,701 --> 00:49:50,937
you knock yourself out.

823
00:49:58,311 --> 00:49:59,745
Good times.

824
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,849
Oh, come on.

825
00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:05,751
That's awful.
What did you eat?

826
00:50:05,884 --> 00:50:08,121
I think it's called a chili dog?

827
00:50:08,254 --> 00:50:11,090
You might want to check
your fur on that one, buddy.

828
00:50:12,191 --> 00:50:14,928
Hey. So, what's this next planet
you're supposed to go to like?

829
00:50:15,061 --> 00:50:17,462
It's no Earth,
I can tell you that.

830
00:50:17,596 --> 00:50:19,498
There's no people,
just breathable air

831
00:50:19,631 --> 00:50:21,633
and giant mushrooms and stuff.

832
00:50:22,201 --> 00:50:23,835
Well, look at it this way.

833
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,838
At least you won't be
the only "fun-guy."

834
00:50:26,973 --> 00:50:29,042
No. Don't ever do that again.

835
00:50:30,442 --> 00:50:32,145
I liked it.

836
00:50:33,812 --> 00:50:36,015
I'm really gonna
miss this place.

837
00:50:36,149 --> 00:50:38,184
I know I have to
leave Earth to be safe,

838
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:40,153
but what if
Longclaw was wrong?

839
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,455
Maybe I could have a life here.

840
00:50:47,592 --> 00:50:50,529
All right.
We should get some sleep.

841
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,932
You sleep.
Don't worry about me.

842
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:56,568
I'm gonna stay up all night
enjoying Earth while I can.

843
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,537
Sure, kid.

844
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:01,040
As long as we're
on the road by 8:00.

845
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,983
I ate a chili dog.
That's why my farts smell.

846
00:51:24,496 --> 00:51:29,235
<i>Thomas Wachowski, accused of committing
an act of domestic terrorism.</i>

847
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:32,171
<i>Wachowski is considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

848
00:51:32,305 --> 00:51:34,140
<i>Any information
regarding his whereabouts</i>

849
00:51:34,273 --> 00:51:37,876
<i>should be reported to
local authorities immediately.</i>

850
00:51:43,548 --> 00:51:45,084
Did he say where he was going?

851
00:51:48,553 --> 00:51:51,190
Maybe. Maybe not.

852
00:51:51,923 --> 00:51:53,592
Like I'd ever tell you.

853
00:51:54,693 --> 00:51:56,561
Stand down, Agent Stone.

854
00:51:56,695 --> 00:52:00,599
This well-meaning citizen obviously doesn't
understand the urgency of the matter.

855
00:52:03,302 --> 00:52:04,569
Really?

856
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,608
Now that's
what I call good cop, bad cop.

857
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:12,744
Hoy!

858
00:52:12,878 --> 00:52:14,579
Left yourself open.

859
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,884
Judging by the quickest route
to San Francisco,

860
00:52:19,018 --> 00:52:20,786
the approximate
speed of their vehicle,

861
00:52:20,919 --> 00:52:22,288
and local weather conditions...

862
00:52:23,855 --> 00:52:25,624
They should be...

863
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:28,127
right about...

864
00:52:29,295 --> 00:52:30,496
here.

865
00:52:30,629 --> 00:52:33,132
- That's brilliant, sir.
- Thanks...

866
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:35,134
for nothing.

867
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:39,571
- So, what's on your bucket list?
- Who, me?

868
00:52:39,704 --> 00:52:41,307
Yeah. Everyone has
a bucket list, right?

869
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:42,641
Sure, but...

870
00:52:42,774 --> 00:52:44,709
I mean, you're the one
leaving Earth, and...

871
00:52:44,843 --> 00:52:46,446
I'm not planning
on dying anytime soon.

872
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:47,879
Don't be so sure.

873
00:52:48,014 --> 00:52:49,781
Your best friend
is a magnet for danger.

874
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:52,051
Are you anointing yourself
as the bestie?

875
00:52:52,185 --> 00:52:53,319
Mm-hmm.

876
00:52:53,453 --> 00:52:55,687
A little presumptuous, but...
I mean... What, no...

877
00:52:55,821 --> 00:52:58,124
I like you, of course, but,

878
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:00,059
you know,
we're not best friends.

879
00:53:00,193 --> 00:53:02,028
You tucked me in last night.

880
00:53:02,161 --> 00:53:03,795
Fine, fine, fine.
Best animal friend.

881
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,498
- That would be my dog, Ozzy.
- Okay...

882
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:09,302
let's drop this increasingly
humiliating topic of conversation.

883
00:53:09,435 --> 00:53:11,237
Bucket list.
Give it to me!

884
00:53:11,803 --> 00:53:13,940
Okay, there is one thing.

885
00:53:14,673 --> 00:53:16,509
In Green Hills,
I've always felt,

886
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:20,012
I don't know, more like a babysitter
than a real cop, you know?

887
00:53:20,146 --> 00:53:23,015
So I want a chance to prove
myself, under real pressure.

888
00:53:23,149 --> 00:53:26,285
I'm gonna move to San Francisco,
become a street cop.

889
00:53:26,419 --> 00:53:29,255
And, I don't know,
see if I have what it takes.

890
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:31,357
What?

891
00:53:32,624 --> 00:53:33,960
Why...
Why is your face doing that?

892
00:53:34,093 --> 00:53:36,295
You're leaving Green Hills?

893
00:53:36,761 --> 00:53:37,964
Okay.

894
00:53:38,097 --> 00:53:40,466
B-B-But why?
Why would you leave Green Hills?

895
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,269
This may be hard for you to understand,
but Green Hills is a small town.

896
00:53:43,402 --> 00:53:44,703
It's a very small town.

897
00:53:44,836 --> 00:53:47,573
Uh, it's not small.
There are hundreds of people.

898
00:53:47,706 --> 00:53:48,975
That's a small town, dude!

899
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:51,910
It's a perfect town,
and the people need you.

900
00:53:52,044 --> 00:53:53,246
Please.
I clean out their gutters.

901
00:53:53,379 --> 00:53:55,481
I jump-start their cars
in the winter.

902
00:53:55,615 --> 00:53:56,848
They could call anybody
to do that.

903
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,552
Sure, they can call anybody,
but they don't.

904
00:53:59,684 --> 00:54:01,220
They call you.

905
00:54:16,602 --> 00:54:20,839
Eeny, meeny, miny...

906
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:22,542
mayhem.

907
00:54:34,153 --> 00:54:35,687
- You're not making any sense.
- Would you calm down?

908
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,624
You come from a great town with
great people and by my count,

909
00:54:38,757 --> 00:54:40,927
zero bad guys
trying to kill you!

910
00:54:43,062 --> 00:54:45,631
Besides, what could possibly
be more important

911
00:54:45,764 --> 00:54:47,799
than protecting
the people you care about?

912
00:54:54,073 --> 00:54:56,209
- Look, I get your poi...
- Whoa!

913
00:54:57,577 --> 00:54:59,011
Yeah!

914
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:07,954
You know what?
I was wrong about you.

915
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:09,821
You're not
the Donut Lord at all.

916
00:55:09,956 --> 00:55:11,457
You're more like the Jerk Lord.

917
00:55:11,591 --> 00:55:14,327
Have you noticed the harpoon
stuck in our dash?

918
00:55:19,031 --> 00:55:21,067
Sonic!

919
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,901
I was forced from my home.

920
00:55:23,035 --> 00:55:25,071
Your home is perfect,
and you're leaving it.

921
00:55:25,204 --> 00:55:26,905
Why would you do that?

922
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:29,642
- Your body!
- Oh, no, not again!

923
00:55:29,774 --> 00:55:30,742
Hey! Hold on!

924
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:32,612
- Why?
- Because I'm gonna do this.

925
00:55:51,564 --> 00:55:53,032
Sonic!

926
00:55:53,865 --> 00:55:55,334
Sonic!

927
00:55:59,472 --> 00:56:02,008
Guess I had a bonus life.

928
00:56:02,675 --> 00:56:05,678
Oh, yeah, baby!

929
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:08,948
Sonic, one. Big Tank, zero.
I'm sorry.

930
00:56:09,081 --> 00:56:11,450
- Did we get that on camera?
- How are you not dead?

931
00:56:11,584 --> 00:56:12,817
I have no idea.

932
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,521
- Do you see me dancing?
- Yes, I saw you dance.

933
00:56:15,655 --> 00:56:17,189
Is that all you got?

934
00:56:17,323 --> 00:56:19,258
No, but thank you for asking.

935
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:25,498
- Uh-oh.
- Sonic! Get back in the truck!

936
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:27,566
You go. I'll catch up.

937
00:56:31,637 --> 00:56:32,938
Ha!

938
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,980
I think that tank
just had a baby.

939
00:56:53,392 --> 00:56:54,460
Incoming!

940
00:56:56,662 --> 00:56:59,365
- It's my turn!
- You just had one. It's mine!

941
00:56:59,498 --> 00:57:01,701
Hey, stop fighting
or I'm taking that thing away!

942
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:02,802
Yeah, right, Dad.

943
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,981
Where are you going?

944
00:57:16,115 --> 00:57:18,417
Just drive the car.
I'll take care of this.

945
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:20,553
And if I don't make it,
just ditch me.

946
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:22,121
You seem good at that.

947
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:33,833
<i>Hey, everyone!
Welcome back to my livestream.</i>

948
00:57:33,966 --> 00:57:34,934
<i>Today we're destroying robots.</i>

949
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:37,036
Step one.

950
00:57:40,973 --> 00:57:43,242
Yes, we did it!

951
00:57:47,446 --> 00:57:50,082
We did not do it.
Who <i>is</i> this guy?

952
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,785
Ever wonder where
your tax dollars are going?

953
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:53,953
My turn.

954
00:57:54,086 --> 00:57:55,588
Here, just keep us
going straight.

955
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:56,888
I put it in cruise control.

956
00:57:57,022 --> 00:57:58,758
I feel just like Vin Diesel.

957
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,993
"It's all about family, Tom."

958
00:58:06,999 --> 00:58:08,667
Quick suggestion.

959
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:12,138
Roll up into a ball
and smash him with your body.

960
00:58:13,105 --> 00:58:15,174
Whoa! Where'd you
learn how to drive?

961
00:58:15,307 --> 00:58:18,077
Here. In this truck.
It's happening as we speak.

962
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,015
I can't reach it.
Bring him in closer.

963
00:58:23,149 --> 00:58:24,517
- What?
- Bring it in closer!

964
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:26,886
- Hit the brakes.
- Oh, you mean this one?

965
00:58:27,019 --> 00:58:28,754
The other brakes!

966
00:58:38,063 --> 00:58:40,366
Ha-ha! Whoo!

967
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:43,002
Oh!

968
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:46,605
Give me a big, fat break!

969
00:58:51,677 --> 00:58:54,680
Aw, this one is cute.
Let's keep him.

970
00:58:55,948 --> 00:58:57,183
Aah!

971
00:58:57,817 --> 00:58:59,218
Oh, come on!

972
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:02,021
How could something
so adorable be so terrible?

973
00:59:04,957 --> 00:59:06,525
You've got car insurance, right?

974
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:14,333
Buzz off.

975
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,101
That doesn't sound good.

976
00:59:16,235 --> 00:59:18,437
- No, beeping is bad. Get rid of it!
- I'm trying.

977
00:59:18,571 --> 00:59:20,306
Throw it out the win...
Throw it anywhere!

978
00:59:20,439 --> 00:59:23,108
- I can't get it off.
- All right, I'm pulling over.

979
00:59:30,883 --> 00:59:32,651
- Did I get it?
- Nope.

980
00:59:33,919 --> 00:59:35,521
Here. Hold still.

981
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,357
It's going,
it's going...

982
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:42,027
It's still here.

983
00:59:43,195 --> 00:59:44,663
Get off me.

984
00:59:44,797 --> 00:59:46,499
Ha-ha! Nailed it!

985
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,376
Sonic!

986
01:00:04,683 --> 01:00:06,051
No, no, no, no, no.

987
01:00:12,558 --> 01:00:16,729
Hey. Come on. You're all right.
Wake up. Wake up.

988
01:00:23,903 --> 01:00:25,604
Did we get 'em?

989
01:00:25,738 --> 01:00:27,540
Oh. No, there they are.

990
01:00:27,673 --> 01:00:30,509
They are real survivors,
those two.

991
01:00:35,414 --> 01:00:37,116
Can we have a moment?

992
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:41,320
Pin yourself
to the wall.

993
01:00:42,588 --> 01:00:44,890
You know, I won't miss you
when you're gone.

994
01:00:45,025 --> 01:00:47,059
Human beings are
unreliable and stupid,

995
01:00:47,192 --> 01:00:48,661
and I care very little
about them.

996
01:00:48,794 --> 01:00:51,697
But my machines are diligent,
relentless.

997
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:53,732
They're everything to me!

998
01:00:55,668 --> 01:00:57,069
Huh?

999
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:18,157
Mmm?

1000
01:01:31,403 --> 01:01:32,738
Come on, buddy.

1001
01:01:32,871 --> 01:01:35,608
You're gonna be all right.
You'll be all right.

1002
01:01:40,981 --> 01:01:42,082
- Is Maddie here?
- No, no.

1003
01:01:42,214 --> 01:01:43,415
- Not today. Goodbye.
- It's an emergency!

1004
01:01:43,549 --> 01:01:45,484
- Bye-bye.
- Rachel, stop! Maddie!

1005
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,053
Don't do this.
This is important.

1006
01:01:47,186 --> 01:01:49,221
- Oh, my God! Rachel, let him in.
- I am calling the police.

1007
01:01:49,355 --> 01:01:51,490
No, I am calling the FBI.
I am calling the CIA.

1008
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,392
- Stop. Don't do that.
- I am calling your mother.

1009
01:01:53,525 --> 01:01:55,361
- Okay, got it.
- Maddie, can we talk?

1010
01:01:55,494 --> 01:01:58,297
Tom, what's going on? You're all over
the news. I've been trying to call you.

1011
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,132
I had to ditch my phone
so they couldn't track me.

1012
01:02:00,265 --> 01:02:01,734
- Ditch his phone?
- Track you?

1013
01:02:01,867 --> 01:02:04,136
- Uncle Tommy!
- Jojo! Hey!

1014
01:02:04,269 --> 01:02:06,805
Now your niece is
an accessory to treason.

1015
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,273
- No, she's not.
- Calm down.

1016
01:02:08,407 --> 01:02:10,342
Calm down?
I will not calm down!

1017
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,112
- Enough.
- Yes, calm down. Stop talking.

1018
01:02:12,244 --> 01:02:14,313
No. Ozzy, please.
Good to see you too.

1019
01:02:14,446 --> 01:02:17,216
Oh, little Lord Baby Jesus.

1020
01:02:17,349 --> 01:02:18,550
What is that, Tom?

1021
01:02:18,684 --> 01:02:20,086
Is that plutonium?
Is it e-mails?

1022
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:21,720
Yes, it's plutonium.

1023
01:02:21,854 --> 01:02:23,789
Can we please go in
the other room and talk...

1024
01:02:23,922 --> 01:02:25,025
Stop it, Ozzy. Quit it!

1025
01:02:25,157 --> 01:02:26,492
This is why I told you
he was no good.

1026
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:29,062
- I'm not engaging.
- No, Ozzy, quit it.

1027
01:02:31,163 --> 01:02:33,532
Ozzy, no! Ozzy, no!

1028
01:02:34,466 --> 01:02:36,835
Oh, catch me, Jojo.

1029
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:39,304
Oh, thank God.

1030
01:02:39,438 --> 01:02:42,841
Can I get a glass of water?

1031
01:04:23,709 --> 01:04:25,245
I just thought
you might like a latte

1032
01:04:25,377 --> 01:04:26,946
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

1033
01:04:27,646 --> 01:04:29,515
Who do I look like,
an imbecile?

1034
01:04:29,648 --> 01:04:32,952
Of course I want a latte.
I love the way you make them!

1035
01:04:39,892 --> 01:04:42,095
Ready the prototype.

1036
01:04:42,228 --> 01:04:43,762
With this kind of power,

1037
01:04:43,896 --> 01:04:48,067
my machines can finally reach
their full potential.

1038
01:04:54,439 --> 01:04:56,408
He's gonna be okay, Jojo.

1039
01:04:57,409 --> 01:04:59,979
Oh, thank God.
He's gonna be okay, right?

1040
01:05:00,113 --> 01:05:02,648
I'm a vet, Tom. I don't even
know what I'm looking at here.

1041
01:05:02,781 --> 01:05:05,018
He's a hedgehog.
Or so he says.

1042
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,919
- It talks?
- Almost constantly.

1043
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:09,655
Okay.

1044
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,323
- Holy...
- What?

1045
01:05:11,456 --> 01:05:12,758
His pulse is super-fast.

1046
01:05:12,891 --> 01:05:14,693
That actually
might be normal for him.

1047
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:16,461
I don't know.
You gotta help him, Maddie.

1048
01:05:16,595 --> 01:05:18,330
I don't know his physiology.

1049
01:05:18,463 --> 01:05:21,034
He doesn't seem
to have any broken bones.

1050
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,937
He's just really banged up.

1051
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,974
Oh, look at
his poor little feet.

1052
01:05:30,977 --> 01:05:33,846
Hang in there, buddy.
You're gonna be all right.

1053
01:05:36,715 --> 01:05:39,384
Jojo?
Untie your mother. Jojo!

1054
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:41,720
Untie Mommy.

1055
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,990
Sweetie. Jojo!

1056
01:05:46,993 --> 01:05:48,427
I have to go to the bathroom.

1057
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,596
- He's gonna be okay, right?
- Uh...

1058
01:05:50,729 --> 01:05:53,233
He'll snap out of this.
He'll wake up soon?

1059
01:05:53,365 --> 01:05:54,533
Oh, smelling salts!

1060
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:55,801
Don't you have, like,
vet smelling salts,

1061
01:05:55,935 --> 01:05:57,769
like for cats or parakeets
or something?

1062
01:05:57,903 --> 01:06:00,739
No. They don't make
cat smelling salts.

1063
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:03,675
- They should.
- I have human smelling salts

1064
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:05,878
in my human first aid kit.

1065
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,580
Okay.

1066
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:11,850
- Here we go.
- Come on, buddy.

1067
01:06:11,985 --> 01:06:13,152
Gotta go fast!

1068
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,656
- Whoa.
- Where am I? What year is it?

1069
01:06:17,789 --> 01:06:19,192
Is The Rock president?

1070
01:06:19,325 --> 01:06:20,525
Whoa, buddy, you're okay.
Calm down.

1071
01:06:20,659 --> 01:06:21,961
Oh, hi, Pretzel Lady!

1072
01:06:22,095 --> 01:06:23,695
Hi.

1073
01:06:24,264 --> 01:06:25,530
- Tom?
- Yeah.

1074
01:06:25,664 --> 01:06:27,033
Can I talk to you, please?

1075
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,338
Space hedgehog, stay there.
Try to rest.

1076
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:33,872
You got it.
I am great at resting.

1077
01:06:34,007 --> 01:06:36,109
I rest faster than anybody.

1078
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,343
Still talking.

1079
01:06:37,476 --> 01:06:38,877
Uh, first of all,
can we take a moment

1080
01:06:39,012 --> 01:06:40,712
to acknowledge how
under control I've been?

1081
01:06:40,846 --> 01:06:42,547
- Amazing.
- Didn't freak out.

1082
01:06:42,681 --> 01:06:45,084
- No.
- Totally calm.

1083
01:06:45,218 --> 01:06:47,320
- Thank you.
- Ahh.

1084
01:06:47,452 --> 01:06:49,488
Second of all...

1085
01:06:49,621 --> 01:06:52,225
What the heck is going on?
Is that thing an alien?

1086
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:55,861
Okay, so, remember how Crazy
Carl is always going on

1087
01:06:55,995 --> 01:06:57,696
- about the blue devil?
- The blue devil!

1088
01:06:57,829 --> 01:06:59,865
- That's him? He's real?
- Yeah.

1089
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:02,101
What is he doing here?
What are you doing here?

1090
01:07:02,235 --> 01:07:04,670
I... kinda sorta...

1091
01:07:04,803 --> 01:07:06,772
shot our little blue friend
with your tranq gun.

1092
01:07:06,905 --> 01:07:09,008
- No, you did not.
- I didn't mean to.

1093
01:07:09,142 --> 01:07:11,044
This is kinda hard
for me to explain.

1094
01:07:11,177 --> 01:07:12,911
And it's gonna sound
a little bit crazy.

1095
01:07:13,046 --> 01:07:15,315
He has to get to
the Transamerica building,

1096
01:07:15,447 --> 01:07:16,882
and I promised
I'd take him.

1097
01:07:17,016 --> 01:07:18,985
Uh-uh! Aliens?

1098
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,586
Maddie, your husband's
lost his mind.

1099
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,655
Use this as an opportunity
to leave him.

1100
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:25,791
No one would judge you.

1101
01:07:30,495 --> 01:07:32,531
So you won't
hurt your feet anymore.

1102
01:07:33,232 --> 01:07:35,001
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1103
01:07:35,767 --> 01:07:37,869
No one's ever
given me a gift before.

1104
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:40,739
I gotta check that
off my bucket list.

1105
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:52,918
All right! Looking good!

1106
01:07:55,388 --> 01:07:56,822
Okay.

1107
01:07:56,956 --> 01:07:59,292
You said you wanted to help
people in real trouble, right?

1108
01:08:00,026 --> 01:08:01,560
Well, that's what you're doing.

1109
01:08:01,693 --> 01:08:05,131
Blue alien hedgehogs still
count as people. Right?

1110
01:08:05,264 --> 01:08:06,432
- I think so too.
- Yeah.

1111
01:08:06,565 --> 01:08:07,766
- I think.
- Okay.

1112
01:08:07,899 --> 01:08:09,868
I love you.
Did I tell you that already?

1113
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,005
I don't deserve you.
You know that?

1114
01:08:12,138 --> 01:08:13,605
I know that.

1115
01:08:16,042 --> 01:08:18,710
So, you're supposed to be
Tom's best friend

1116
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:20,346
that he won't shut up about.

1117
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:23,882
Well, I don't see the appeal.

1118
01:08:25,084 --> 01:08:27,120
Stop!

1119
01:08:27,253 --> 01:08:29,654
That is very gross.

1120
01:08:30,756 --> 01:08:32,125
- Hey.
- Hey.

1121
01:08:32,258 --> 01:08:35,094
So, my truck still runs,
but it's pretty much totaled.

1122
01:08:35,228 --> 01:08:37,363
You think your sister would
mind if we borrowed her car?

1123
01:08:37,497 --> 01:08:39,198
You have got to be kidding me!

1124
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,566
- She'll be fine.
- Yeah, let's do that.

1125
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,069
Mm-hmm.

1126
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,371
This is my house!

1127
01:08:45,505 --> 01:08:47,340
Coming through!

1128
01:08:47,473 --> 01:08:50,609
Whoa, whoa! Now this is my turn,
and I go around you.

1129
01:08:50,742 --> 01:08:52,577
Sorry! And...

1130
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,913
- perfect park.
- What are you, crazy?

1131
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,215
Is there anything
you didn't hit?

1132
01:08:56,349 --> 01:08:57,849
Why did we let the alien drive?

1133
01:08:57,984 --> 01:09:01,187
Hey, I got us here.
And please, five stars.

1134
01:09:02,687 --> 01:09:05,924
- So, this is it?
- That's it. That's your pyramid.

1135
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,261
Wow, look at that thing!

1136
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,728
What happens now?

1137
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:13,166
- Oh. He's... gone.
- Yep.

1138
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,936
No good. You need a special
key to get to the roof.

1139
01:09:18,171 --> 01:09:19,571
What now?

1140
01:09:19,704 --> 01:09:22,774
Time for me to abuse
the power entrusted to me.

1141
01:09:32,518 --> 01:09:34,719
We got a jumper on the roof.
Gotta get up there fast

1142
01:09:34,853 --> 01:09:37,123
or we're gonna have
a human pancake on our hands.

1143
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,325
You came all the way
from Montana.

1144
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:42,195
Yeah. That's how serious it is.

1145
01:09:47,066 --> 01:09:48,101
Okay.

1146
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:51,270
You just saved a life.

1147
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,848
How much longer?
I can't breathe in here.

1148
01:10:04,749 --> 01:10:07,053
Hello?
Anybody there?

1149
01:10:07,186 --> 01:10:09,455
Do you have your child
in that bag?

1150
01:10:09,589 --> 01:10:10,789
No.

1151
01:10:10,922 --> 01:10:13,392
I mean, yes, it's a child,
but it's not mine.

1152
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,394
It's not your child.

1153
01:10:15,528 --> 01:10:17,863
Relax.
I'm a cop, okay?

1154
01:10:17,997 --> 01:10:19,499
Plus, he likes it in there,
don't you, buddy?

1155
01:10:19,631 --> 01:10:21,000
Why would I
like it in here?

1156
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:24,203
This is worse than the dog cage
you had me in earlier.

1157
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:27,839
Such a kidder.

1158
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:30,709
- Okay.
- No, I'm scared of the dark!

1159
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:32,711
Is anybody there?

1160
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:47,493
What were you
keeping in this bag?

1161
01:10:47,627 --> 01:10:48,995
A jar of pickled farts?

1162
01:10:49,128 --> 01:10:50,963
All right.
What are we looking for?

1163
01:10:53,933 --> 01:10:55,667
This.

1164
01:10:56,402 --> 01:10:58,037
Okay.
What happens now?

1165
01:10:58,171 --> 01:10:59,972
Now all I have to do
is think of where I want

1166
01:11:00,106 --> 01:11:02,341
the other end of the ring
to appear, and I throw it.

1167
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:04,443
So that's it?
We did it?

1168
01:11:04,577 --> 01:11:06,312
Yeah. We did it!

1169
01:11:06,445 --> 01:11:10,016
Hey. Sorry we didn't get to do
everything on your bucket list, pal.

1170
01:11:10,149 --> 01:11:12,884
It's okay.
I did the ones I needed the most.

1171
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:16,422
You two are so cute.

1172
01:11:16,556 --> 01:11:18,690
- Oh, please. What?
- We are not.

1173
01:11:18,823 --> 01:11:20,326
No.
We're not cute.

1174
01:11:20,459 --> 01:11:23,029
We are a couple of loose cannons
just living by our own rules.

1175
01:11:23,162 --> 01:11:23,895
Exactly.

1176
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,364
- Really?
- Yeah.

1177
01:11:25,498 --> 01:11:28,134
And our rules include
expressing heartfelt emotions.

1178
01:11:28,267 --> 01:11:29,535
If you say so.

1179
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:32,238
- Okay, then.
- All right.

1180
01:11:33,172 --> 01:11:35,041
- Um, you gotta go, right?
- Yeah, I gotta go.

1181
01:11:35,174 --> 01:11:36,509
I gotta go.
We gotta go too.

1182
01:11:36,642 --> 01:11:38,344
See... All right, bye-bye.

1183
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:44,951
Just one more thing.

1184
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:54,927
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

1185
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:00,333
I know it's a tough decision
for you to leave Green Hills.

1186
01:12:00,466 --> 01:12:03,236
Walking away from
something you care about

1187
01:12:03,868 --> 01:12:05,071
has to be painful.

1188
01:12:05,204 --> 01:12:07,340
You're not sure
you really want to go, huh?

1189
01:12:08,374 --> 01:12:11,743
I don't want to go,
but I can't stay.

1190
01:12:11,876 --> 01:12:14,513
As long as I'm here,
I put everyone in danger.

1191
01:12:14,981 --> 01:12:17,149
I can't do that.

1192
01:12:17,283 --> 01:12:21,487
I just want you to know that
these last two days have been

1193
01:12:21,621 --> 01:12:24,290
the best two days of my life.

1194
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,694
You know, I never
thought I'd say this,

1195
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:31,530
but I'm actually gonna miss
you, you little blue devil.

1196
01:12:31,664 --> 01:12:33,466
I'll miss you too,
Donut Lord.

1197
01:12:34,467 --> 01:12:35,501
Thank you.

1198
01:12:36,202 --> 01:12:37,236
For what?

1199
01:12:38,004 --> 01:12:39,804
For saving my life.

1200
01:12:57,423 --> 01:13:00,493
Okay. Did someone leave
their "Find My Phone" on?

1201
01:13:27,086 --> 01:13:30,022
Welcome to San Francisco,
Mr. Wachowski.

1202
01:13:30,855 --> 01:13:32,425
Are you enjoying
the clam chowder?

1203
01:13:32,558 --> 01:13:34,826
It's the government wack job
who keeps trying to kill us.

1204
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,262
Unsuccessfully!

1205
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:38,230
Nice of you to swing by
on your way to Comic-Con.

1206
01:13:38,364 --> 01:13:40,433
Yeah,
what are you wearing?

1207
01:13:41,866 --> 01:13:43,336
It's a flight suit,

1208
01:13:43,469 --> 01:13:46,072
designed to modulate my body
temperature and reduce drag.

1209
01:13:46,205 --> 01:13:47,807
Yeah, and yet
you still are one.

1210
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,709
Ooh-hoo! Good one.

1211
01:13:49,841 --> 01:13:51,544
You are catching fire,
Thomas.

1212
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:54,680
Oh, and speaking of heat,
I see you've taken a lover.

1213
01:13:54,814 --> 01:13:56,048
Does she have a name

1214
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:58,484
or should we just call her
"collateral damage"?

1215
01:13:58,617 --> 01:14:00,086
Hey, watch your mouth.

1216
01:14:00,219 --> 01:14:02,021
Unless you want a little more
of what I gave you earlier?

1217
01:14:02,154 --> 01:14:03,556
I punched him
in the face.

1218
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,725
Oh! He punched him right in the face!
It was awesome!

1219
01:14:05,857 --> 01:14:08,928
The time for talking is over!
It's time to push buttons.

1220
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:12,131
Your flying eggs are pretty
impressive, Mr. Eggman,

1221
01:14:12,264 --> 01:14:14,633
but let's face it,
you'll never catch me.

1222
01:14:14,767 --> 01:14:16,402
Confidence!

1223
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:19,004
A fool's substitute
for intelligence.

1224
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:28,447
- That's not good.
- Uh...

1225
01:14:28,581 --> 01:14:30,483
Sonic, I know you got the
super-speed and everything,

1226
01:14:30,616 --> 01:14:33,719
- but Maddie and I...
- Totally defenseless? Probably gonna get blown up?

1227
01:14:33,853 --> 01:14:35,755
Pretty much, yeah.

1228
01:14:35,887 --> 01:14:38,591
Don't worry.
I know exactly what to do.

1229
01:14:45,998 --> 01:14:47,833
I was not expecting that.

1230
01:14:47,967 --> 01:14:51,170
But I was expecting not to expect
something, so it doesn't count.

1231
01:15:33,546 --> 01:15:35,514
Pew, pew-pew-pew,
pew-pew-pew-pew!

1232
01:15:39,351 --> 01:15:42,455
Oh!

1233
01:15:51,063 --> 01:15:52,531
Come on!

1234
01:15:53,098 --> 01:15:54,733
Come on, come on, come on.

1235
01:16:06,879 --> 01:16:09,348
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no, no!

1236
01:16:21,193 --> 01:16:22,862
Oh! Hi, Tom.

1237
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,097
Glad you're here.
Could use some help.

1238
01:16:25,231 --> 01:16:26,967
Old Bessie's about to give birth.

1239
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:29,368
Give me a minute.

1240
01:16:29,869 --> 01:16:31,170
Aah.

1241
01:16:32,204 --> 01:16:35,608
Can I give you one
genius piece of advice?

1242
01:16:35,976 --> 01:16:37,409
Don't run.

1243
01:16:37,543 --> 01:16:39,745
It'll only hurt more if you do.

1244
01:16:39,879 --> 01:16:42,248
And it's bad for your joints.
They've proved it.

1245
01:16:42,381 --> 01:16:44,783
All right, Eggman.
You wanna get fast?

1246
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:45,986
Let's get fast.

1247
01:16:49,255 --> 01:16:50,689
The hard way it is.

1248
01:17:09,742 --> 01:17:11,744
That was an illegal left,
by the way.

1249
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,282
<i>So, here we are again.</i>

1250
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,917
<i>We've been through
so much together.</i>

1251
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,686
<i>Now you understand why there's
a psychotic robot doctor</i>

1252
01:17:20,819 --> 01:17:23,122
<i>chasing a supersonic
blue hedgehog.</i>

1253
01:17:23,255 --> 01:17:26,158
<i>Want to know how it ends?
Yeah, me too.</i>

1254
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:44,643
How is this possible?

1255
01:17:44,777 --> 01:17:47,279
No one's ever
caught up to me before.

1256
01:17:54,887 --> 01:17:56,689
Coming through!

1257
01:17:56,822 --> 01:17:57,856
<i>Sacrebleu!</i>

1258
01:17:58,724 --> 01:18:01,293
<i>Excusez-moi, monsieur!</i>

1259
01:18:05,031 --> 01:18:07,466
Here we go.
Room to open it up.

1260
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:17,876
I can't lose him!

1261
01:18:32,092 --> 01:18:34,893
If you can't beat 'em,
blind 'em.

1262
01:18:37,964 --> 01:18:40,232
Lost visual contact.

1263
01:18:44,837 --> 01:18:48,807
You're not allowed up there!
It's one of the Seven Wonders!

1264
01:19:13,033 --> 01:19:14,700
Get out of here!

1265
01:19:22,408 --> 01:19:25,844
You're an astonishing
little creature.

1266
01:19:27,813 --> 01:19:29,949
It'll be fun to take you
back to the lab

1267
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:32,718
for a litany of invasive
exploratory procedures.

1268
01:19:33,485 --> 01:19:35,421
Any last words?

1269
01:19:36,156 --> 01:19:39,191
Guac. I like that word.

1270
01:19:40,592 --> 01:19:42,695
I don't have to tell you how
many scientific breakthroughs

1271
01:19:42,828 --> 01:19:45,264
have been made possible
by animal testing.

1272
01:19:45,397 --> 01:19:46,598
You're being very selfish.

1273
01:19:46,732 --> 01:19:47,800
Going my way?

1274
01:19:47,934 --> 01:19:49,035
What the...

1275
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,608
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1276
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:01,213
I'm the Donut Lord,
you son of a...

1277
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:08,387
Autopilot, adjust.

1278
01:20:08,955 --> 01:20:10,255
Why?

1279
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:13,525
Why would you throw
your life away for this thing?

1280
01:20:13,659 --> 01:20:14,928
That's why I don't have friends.

1281
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:17,229
Next thing you know,
you're somebody's best man.

1282
01:20:17,362 --> 01:20:18,697
They want to have
the wedding out of town.

1283
01:20:18,831 --> 01:20:21,101
Like nobody has anything
better to do!

1284
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,702
Anyway, where were we?

1285
01:20:23,836 --> 01:20:26,672
Oh, yes.
You were about to die.

1286
01:20:28,674 --> 01:20:30,676
That's our sheriff
you're messing with.

1287
01:20:32,212 --> 01:20:33,947
And our blue devil...

1288
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,382
who as everyone can see
is a very real creature,

1289
01:20:37,516 --> 01:20:40,285
and not at all invented by me.

1290
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,523
- Oh, careful.
- Just... Just put it away.

1291
01:20:44,656 --> 01:20:45,858
Tom?

1292
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:01,040
I don't mean
to be indelicate here,

1293
01:21:01,174 --> 01:21:04,944
but someone should get some ice,
keep the body fresh.

1294
01:21:07,713 --> 01:21:10,150
He's just a silly little alien.

1295
01:21:10,649 --> 01:21:12,284
He didn't belong here!

1296
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:16,388
That little alien

1297
01:21:16,522 --> 01:21:19,959
knew more about being human
than you ever will.

1298
01:21:20,492 --> 01:21:21,827
His name was Sonic.

1299
01:21:22,895 --> 01:21:24,296
This was his home.

1300
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:26,698
And he was my friend.

1301
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:53,026
He's all yours.

1302
01:21:54,593 --> 01:21:55,962
Everyone, get back!

1303
01:21:59,531 --> 01:22:02,501
I think you have something
that belongs to me.

1304
01:22:03,102 --> 01:22:04,336
Whoa.

1305
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:14,913
This is my power.

1306
01:22:15,048 --> 01:22:17,649
And I'm not using it
to run away anymore.

1307
01:22:17,783 --> 01:22:21,587
I'm using it
to protect my friends.

1308
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:20,646
Ooh! Now you've done it!

1309
01:23:20,779 --> 01:23:22,148
Guess what, Eggman?

1310
01:23:22,282 --> 01:23:24,951
I'm not leaving Earth. You are.

1311
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:26,885
Donut Lord?

1312
01:24:15,734 --> 01:24:18,204
- I told you, you got this.
- Hey, <i>we</i> got this.

1313
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:33,152
- I think these belong to you.
- Thank you very much.

1314
01:24:34,586 --> 01:24:36,189
No more pushing people
off of buildings.

1315
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:37,957
You know
I can't promise that.

1316
01:24:41,394 --> 01:24:44,130
- You did pretty good, space hog.
- Thanks, Donut Lord.

1317
01:24:44,263 --> 01:24:47,300
You're gonna have to explain
this "Donut Lord" thing.

1318
01:24:47,433 --> 01:24:50,236
Nope, sorry. That's for me
and the little guy. Right?

1319
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:53,772
- We got our thing, you got your thing with your... sister.
- Oh, my God, my sister.

1320
01:24:53,905 --> 01:24:58,610
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.

1321
01:24:58,744 --> 01:25:00,679
Jojo, put on my Fitbit...

1322
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,182
so I can at least
get some steps.

1323
01:25:03,316 --> 01:25:04,816
We can never go back there.

1324
01:25:06,219 --> 01:25:07,753
I mean, are we?

1325
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:12,557
'Cause it kind of feels like
we're home right now.

1326
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:13,960
Really?

1327
01:25:15,294 --> 01:25:18,498
I kind of feel like
I checked the "save a life" box

1328
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:20,033
off my bucket list.

1329
01:25:22,468 --> 01:25:24,603
Now all I want to do
is spend my life

1330
01:25:24,736 --> 01:25:26,571
with the people
I care about.

1331
01:25:27,672 --> 01:25:29,108
I want to check that box.

1332
01:25:30,343 --> 01:25:32,544
Okay, I like that.

1333
01:25:32,677 --> 01:25:35,181
All right, everybody.
Nothing to see here.

1334
01:25:35,314 --> 01:25:36,482
Let's disperse.

1335
01:25:36,615 --> 01:25:38,284
Just another ordinary day
in Green Hills.

1336
01:25:38,418 --> 01:25:40,019
Carl,
I'll take that chain saw.

1337
01:25:40,619 --> 01:25:42,155
Come on. Let's go!

1338
01:25:42,288 --> 01:25:44,157
You act like
you've never seen a fight

1339
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:48,894
between an intergalactic space
rodent and a robot with a doctorate.

1340
01:25:57,803 --> 01:25:59,571
You got enough there?

1341
01:25:59,704 --> 01:26:01,640
- Yes, Mr. Manager.
- Need any more?

1342
01:26:01,773 --> 01:26:03,342
You get that away.

1343
01:26:13,819 --> 01:26:15,587
Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski?

1344
01:26:16,522 --> 01:26:17,756
Yes?

1345
01:26:19,791 --> 01:26:21,561
A token of appreciation
from your government,

1346
01:26:21,693 --> 01:26:25,164
for keeping quiet about recent
incidents, which never occurred.

1347
01:26:27,533 --> 01:26:29,035
Wow!

1348
01:26:29,168 --> 01:26:31,803
- Wonder what it is.
- Money to fix the house?

1349
01:26:31,938 --> 01:26:34,273
- Letter from the President?
- You'll see.

1350
01:26:34,407 --> 01:26:35,975
Okay.

1351
01:26:38,844 --> 01:26:40,846
- Olive Garden.
- Hmm, yeah.

1352
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:43,282
The way you said
"You'll see" made me think

1353
01:26:43,416 --> 01:26:45,218
it was something better
than the things we said.

1354
01:26:45,351 --> 01:26:48,121
Have you tried their
Never Ending Pasta Bowl?

1355
01:26:48,254 --> 01:26:49,721
It never ends.

1356
01:26:49,855 --> 01:26:52,024
- That sounds... fancy.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1357
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:55,328
Well, thank you.
We appreciate the gesture.

1358
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,464
Oh, hey. I guess we can close the
file on that Robotnik guy, huh?

1359
01:26:58,598 --> 01:26:59,532
Just disappeared.

1360
01:26:59,664 --> 01:27:00,899
I'm sorry,

1361
01:27:01,033 --> 01:27:04,337
but no such person exists
or ever has existed.

1362
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:06,838
I wish that were true.

1363
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:08,441
You haven't by any chance
been in contact

1364
01:27:08,574 --> 01:27:11,177
with a certain alien creature
since the incident, have you?

1365
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:13,012
Uncle Sam would love
to have a chat with him.

1366
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:15,914
Very casual.
Brunch, perhaps.

1367
01:27:17,517 --> 01:27:18,551
Oh, you mean
the little blue guy.

1368
01:27:18,683 --> 01:27:19,619
- Mmm.
- No.

1369
01:27:19,751 --> 01:27:21,686
- No, nothing. No.
- Mm-mmm.

1370
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:24,190
- Doubt we'll ever hear from him again.
- Mm-mmm.

1371
01:27:24,723 --> 01:27:26,259
Very well.

1372
01:27:26,691 --> 01:27:28,161
Okay.

1373
01:27:28,294 --> 01:27:29,861
- Thank you.
- Great.

1374
01:27:29,996 --> 01:27:31,097
Mmm.

1375
01:27:32,031 --> 01:27:32,764
Yep.

1376
01:27:36,269 --> 01:27:38,504
To be honest, I'm pretty
pumped about the pasta bowl.

1377
01:27:39,972 --> 01:27:41,574
So, do you guys wanna
watch a movie or what?

1378
01:27:41,706 --> 01:27:42,874
Sorry, buddy,
it's a school night.

1379
01:27:43,009 --> 01:27:44,510
It's time for you
to go back to your cave.

1380
01:27:44,644 --> 01:27:46,678
What?
It's 3:00 in the afternoon!

1381
01:27:46,811 --> 01:27:48,414
You know how you get
when you're tired. Come on.

1382
01:27:48,548 --> 01:27:49,881
Me? I'm not like anything.

1383
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:53,119
- You guys are so uncool.
- Yeah, yeah, we know.

1384
01:27:53,252 --> 01:27:55,087
Hey, buddy, where you going?

1385
01:27:55,221 --> 01:27:56,956
You said I have to
go back to my cave.

1386
01:27:57,557 --> 01:27:58,924
We did.

1387
01:28:13,606 --> 01:28:16,209
Oh, my... Are you kidding me?

1388
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:19,312
I can't believe it.

1389
01:28:19,445 --> 01:28:20,879
How did you...

1390
01:28:21,581 --> 01:28:23,848
It's... It's all here.

1391
01:28:33,926 --> 01:28:36,162
Look at this! Are you kidding?
And the beanbag?

1392
01:28:36,295 --> 01:28:38,231
No way!
How did you even get this?

1393
01:28:38,364 --> 01:28:41,000
And you got it all the way over...
Oh!

1394
01:28:41,133 --> 01:28:43,236
I love it, I love it,
I love it, I love it!

1395
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:49,408
Well, welcome home.

1396
01:28:49,542 --> 01:28:52,211
Thank you, so much.

1397
01:29:01,087 --> 01:29:02,355
<i>Oh, no, you don't.</i>

1398
01:29:02,488 --> 01:29:05,224
<i>No second-best animal friends
allowed in my room.</i>

1399
01:29:05,358 --> 01:29:07,026
<i>Wait. What are you doing?</i>

1400
01:29:07,159 --> 01:29:09,362
<i>Stay away from me.
Stop it!</i>

1401
01:29:09,495 --> 01:29:11,631
<i>I'm warning you.
I've got nunchucks!</i>

1402
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:14,100
<i>Hey, stop.
Okay, you can stay.</i>

1403
01:29:31,317 --> 01:29:35,154
My grasp on sanity remains...
absolute.

1404
01:29:36,722 --> 01:29:38,424
Isn't that right,
Agent Stone?

1405
01:29:43,329 --> 01:29:45,564
Why don't you get a head start?

1406
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:50,436
Do some rock-connaissance.

1407
01:29:50,569 --> 01:29:53,639
Rock-connaissance!
Come on! That's hilarious!

1408
01:29:53,773 --> 01:29:55,308
What's the matter with you?

1409
01:29:55,441 --> 01:29:59,045
Here's the "sitch." Uninhabited planet.

1410
01:30:00,279 --> 01:30:04,483
No resources, no supplies,
no apparent way home.

1411
01:30:06,885 --> 01:30:08,587
A lesser man would die here.
