2
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,826
Is it ready?

3
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:20,885
<i>Hey, that's a great punch.</i>

4
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,181
Fear no good. So emotion...

5
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:44,592
Breathing.

6
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:40,688
Breakdown, breakdown.

7
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:56,662
Okay.

8
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,960
I can make it work for a while...

9
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:05,170
...but you need...

10
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:13,887
Okay. Okay.

11
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:31,363
No, no, no. Shut that off.

12
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,240
Turn it off!

13
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:37,452
Watch out!

14
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:09,901
Okay.

15
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:12,670
Martina.

16
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:36,986
No, wait. Oh, that's not right.

17
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,231
You see that? You see that?

18
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:17,442
Our ticket out of here.

19
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:52,910
Damn it.

20
00:12:56,723 --> 00:12:58,892
Here's something
a bit more interesting.

21
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,394
It's possible gamma sickness.

22
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:02,687
<i>Milwaukee.</i>

23
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:06,816
<i>A man drank
one of those guarana sodas.</i>

24
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:10,778
<i>Guess it had a little more kick
than he was looking for.</i>

25
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:17,993
Where was it bottled?

26
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:20,162
Porto Verde, Brazil.

27
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:23,874
Get our agency people looking
for a white man at that bottling plant.

28
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,503
Tell them no contact.
If he even sees them, he's gone.

29
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:52,277
I got you what I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.

30
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:53,778
And I pulled you an ace.

31
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,118
Emil Blonsky.

32
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:03,538
Born in Russia, raised in England...

33
00:14:03,705 --> 00:14:07,125
...and on loan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.

34
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,090
I know you're cashing some chips
for this, Joe.

35
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:16,301
Glad I could help.

36
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:18,344
Just make it good.

37
00:14:26,936 --> 00:14:30,648
This is the target and the location.
Snatch and grab, live capture.

38
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:34,486
Have your dart clips and suppression
ordinance, live fire is for backup only.

39
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:37,655
We got local out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.

40
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:38,990
Is he a fighter?

41
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,494
Your target is a fugitive
from the U.S. Government...

42
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,038
...and stole military secrets.

43
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:49,666
He is also implicated
in the deaths...

44
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,920
...of two scientists, a military officer,
an Idaho state trooper...

45
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:57,299
...and possibly two Canadian hunters,
so don't wait to see if he's a fighter.

46
00:14:57,925 --> 00:14:59,093
Trank him...

47
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:01,637
...and bring him back.

48
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:44,387
Oh, come on.

49
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:47,949
Gentlemen.

50
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,703
Here we go.

51
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:06,217
Get rid of the damn dog.

52
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:19,105
Take him.

53
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:32,702
Target's on the move.

54
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:43,170
Where is he?

55
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,010
- He's on the ground.
- Let's go.

56
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:52,512
Go.

57
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:54,848
Move, move.

58
00:17:57,642 --> 00:17:59,060
Thank you.

59
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:17,746
Go, go, go!

60
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,707
Go, go!

61
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:24,878
Stay on him!

62
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:28,006
Do not lose him.

63
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:27,998
Get around behind him.

64
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:33,170
Target moving past
Mobile Unit 090.

65
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:47,851
Oh, no.

66
00:20:49,311 --> 00:20:51,188
You gotta be kidding me.

67
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:23,052
<i>Where is he?</i>

68
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:24,720
Target acquired.

69
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:55,917
Let's go.

70
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,438
My computer.

71
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:19,232
Give me that. No.

72
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:26,114
Not so tough now, huh?

73
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:28,450
Try those fancy moves again.
Come on.

74
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:30,493
Stop. Please.

75
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,288
Me angry...

76
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,372
...very bad.

77
00:22:35,706 --> 00:22:37,416
You very angry?

78
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,752
<i>I very angry.</i>

79
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:45,632
Oh, no.

80
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,678
You don't understand. Something
really bad is about to happen here.

81
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:51,889
Yeah. Very bad.

82
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:09,114
Anybody else seeing this?

83
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,816
<i>We got a bogey. Please advise.</i>

84
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:48,027
That is the target!
Use every trank you've got.

85
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:49,987
<i>Do it now.</i>

86
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:58,871
Go wide. Go wide.

87
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:00,540
Go wide. Move.

88
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:03,710
No.

89
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,700
Behind him. Get behind him.

90
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:38,076
Move! Move!

91
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,754
Get him!

92
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:51,006
Get him! Get him!

93
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,272
Leave me alone.

94
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:20,677
No! No!

95
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:35,482
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.

96
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:36,984
Had it on him when he bolted.

97
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:46,160
Is that a girlfriend?

98
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:47,453
She helps him maybe?

99
00:26:50,372 --> 00:26:53,042
She is no longer a factor.

100
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:55,878
We closed that door to him
a long time ago. He's alone.

101
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,713
He wants to be alone.

102
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:01,342
Let's see
if he's been talking to anybody.

103
00:27:08,682 --> 00:27:10,642
Forgive me, sir.

104
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,896
Doesn't anybody want to talk about
what went down in there, because...?

105
00:27:16,314 --> 00:27:17,565
He didn't lose us.

106
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:20,777
And he was not alone, sir.

107
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:22,695
We had him,
and then something hit us.

108
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:26,824
Something... Something big hit us.

109
00:27:29,202 --> 00:27:32,413
It threw a forklift truck
like it was a softball.

110
00:27:34,332 --> 00:27:37,877
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.

111
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,338
Well, it's gone.

112
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:44,300
Well, if Banner knows what it is...

113
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:47,261
...l'm gonna track him down,
put my foot on his throat and...

114
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:49,722
That was Banner.

115
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,436
It...

116
00:27:57,146 --> 00:27:58,439
...was Banner.

117
00:27:58,606 --> 00:28:01,733
You have to explain
that statement, sir.

118
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,943
No, I don't.

119
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,280
You've done a good job.

120
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,493
Pack up
and get our men on the plane.

121
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,286
We're going home.

122
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,441
Can you help me?

123
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:27,068
I don't speak Portuguese.

124
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:30,988
What? Where...?

125
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:33,366
Where am I?

126
00:29:34,617 --> 00:29:36,284
Guatemala.

127
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:39,371
I'm going to the next town.

128
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:43,875
Will you help me?

129
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,211
Get in.

130
00:29:48,213 --> 00:29:49,464
Here, put this on.

131
00:29:57,013 --> 00:29:58,223
Where are you going?

132
00:29:58,682 --> 00:30:00,392
Home.

133
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:09,275
I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.

134
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:10,777
I've seen good men go down...

135
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,072
...because someone didn't let us know
what we were walking into.

136
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:16,366
I've moved on
because that's what we do.

137
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:17,992
I mean, that's the job.

138
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,786
But this...

139
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,414
This is a whole new level of weird.

140
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:26,500
I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.

141
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:29,920
So if you're taking another
crack at him, I want in.

142
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:32,506
And with respect,
you should be looking for a team...

143
00:30:32,673 --> 00:30:36,427
...that's prepped and ready to fight
because if that thing shows up again...

144
00:30:37,094 --> 00:30:41,515
...you'll have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants...

145
00:30:41,682 --> 00:30:42,766
...sir.

146
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,404
Oh, yeah.

147
00:32:10,185 --> 00:32:12,562
Let me emphasise
what I'm about to share with you...

148
00:32:12,729 --> 00:32:16,858
...is tremendously sensitive
both to me personally and the Army.

149
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:22,030
You're aware that we've got an infantry
weapons development programme...

150
00:32:22,197 --> 00:32:26,535
...while in WWll,
they initiated a subprogramme...

151
00:32:26,702 --> 00:32:29,246
...for biotech force enhancement.

152
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:30,914
A super soldier.

153
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,377
Yes.

154
00:32:35,544 --> 00:32:38,547
An oversimplification, but yes.

155
00:32:38,714 --> 00:32:39,881
And I dusted it off.

156
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:42,300
Got them doing serious work again.
Bold work.

157
00:32:42,676 --> 00:32:45,219
Across the hall,
they're trying to arm you better.

158
00:32:45,386 --> 00:32:47,013
We're trying to make you better.

159
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,894
Banner's work was very early phase.

160
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:56,188
It wasn't even weapons application.

161
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:59,025
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.

162
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:02,319
I would never have told him
what the project really was.

163
00:33:02,486 --> 00:33:04,405
But he was so sure
of what he was onto...

164
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:07,033
...that he tested it on himself.

165
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:11,078
And something went very wrong.

166
00:33:12,496 --> 00:33:14,123
Or it went very right.

167
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:18,794
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is property of the U.S. Army.

168
00:33:19,253 --> 00:33:22,214
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?

169
00:33:22,381 --> 00:33:24,133
- No.
- But you were, weren't you?

170
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:25,926
You were trying other things.

171
00:33:26,635 --> 00:33:30,264
One serum we developed...

172
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:32,849
...it was very promising.
- So why did he run?

173
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,685
He's a scientist.

174
00:33:36,186 --> 00:33:38,772
He is not one of us.

175
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,109
Blonsky, how old are you?
Forty-five?

176
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:47,989
- Thirty-nine.
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?

177
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:49,741
Yes, it does.

178
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:51,242
So get out of the trenches.

179
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:53,536
You should be a colonel now
with your record.

180
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:55,497
No, I'm a fighter.

181
00:33:55,664 --> 00:33:57,457
I'll be one for as long as I can.

182
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:01,461
If I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had 10 years ago...

183
00:34:01,628 --> 00:34:04,130
...that would be someone
I wouldn't wanna fight.

184
00:34:06,132 --> 00:34:08,968
I could probably arrange
something like that.

185
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:32,275
Take care, kids.

186
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,704
Stan, I give you my word.

187
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,956
Whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.

188
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:49,458
I know it. I always knew it.

189
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,878
And you know
how I felt about you two.

190
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:58,384
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

191
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:00,845
She doesn't know that I'm here.

192
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:03,973
She's with somebody?

193
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,267
He's a head shrink.

194
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:10,396
They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy.

195
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,109
Good, that's good.

196
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,319
Bruce.

197
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:19,822
- What can I do to help you?
- I could use a bed for a few nights.

198
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:22,825
You can have
the spare room upstairs.

199
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,827
That'd be so great.

200
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:29,164
There is... There's one other thing.

201
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,502
Excuse me. Pardon me.

202
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,130
Coming through.

203
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,512
Hey, pal, I got a delivery on 5.

204
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,473
I don't think
there's anybody up here.

205
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,142
Oh, man, I'm gonna catch hell
if I don't collect.

206
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,686
You gotta let me try.

207
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,981
I tell you what.
I got an extra medium.

208
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,566
Take it on the house.

209
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:06,117
- You are the man.
- God bless you, partner.

210
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,538
Oh, boy.

211
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,595
Okay.

212
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:24,670
We're pretty well closed here, folks,
I'm sorry.

213
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:27,339
Oh, come on, Stan, it's Friday night.

214
00:40:28,423 --> 00:40:30,425
Oh, kids.

215
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:34,805
- I got nothing but marinara now.
- I gotta have a Mr. Pink, please.

216
00:40:34,971 --> 00:40:38,516
She worked through dinner again,
of course.

217
00:40:44,855 --> 00:40:46,649
Stan?

218
00:40:48,693 --> 00:40:51,696
I go...
So, yes, I mean, where were you?

219
00:40:51,862 --> 00:40:53,906
I can't...
I don't know where you were, Cecil.

220
00:40:54,073 --> 00:40:56,450
Then he goes,
"Not where you've been at."

221
00:40:56,617 --> 00:41:01,247
I felt... Oh, my God, I just felt so awful.

222
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:29,733
Bruce.

223
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:37,824
Betty?

224
00:41:37,991 --> 00:41:39,909
What's going on?

225
00:41:54,257 --> 00:41:55,342
Betty.

226
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:58,595
Just tell me if I saw
what I think I saw.

227
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:01,097
I don't know what to say.

228
00:42:01,264 --> 00:42:04,684
Please, just tell me the truth.

229
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,227
Oh, God. Thank God.

230
00:42:57,403 --> 00:42:59,153
I want you to come with me now.

231
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,490
Please, come with me.

232
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:05,076
Please.

233
00:43:34,397 --> 00:43:36,691
It's our data.

234
00:43:36,858 --> 00:43:40,862
That got in there
before they carted it all away.

235
00:43:42,196 --> 00:43:45,074
I hoped somewhere that
it might tell us something someday.

236
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:52,873
- Does the general know you have this?
- No, I don't think so.

237
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,375
I haven't spoken to him
in a couple of years.

238
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:57,586
- You have to be sure.
- Bruce.

239
00:43:58,128 --> 00:44:02,049
I don't understand why we can't just
go in there together and talk to him.

240
00:44:02,215 --> 00:44:05,052
He told me what he wanted to do.

241
00:44:05,218 --> 00:44:07,054
He wants it out of me.

242
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,223
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.

243
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,893
He wants to make it a weapon.

244
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:06,737
- Hi.
- Hi.

245
00:45:08,948 --> 00:45:11,867
- I thought you might wanna...
- Thanks.

246
00:45:12,785 --> 00:45:16,247
Listen, I should leave early.
As early as I can.

247
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:18,040
Really?

248
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,916
You can't stay at all?

249
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:23,545
I want to,
but it's not just safe for me to be here.

250
00:45:25,964 --> 00:45:28,091
If I could borrow some cash...

251
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,301
- Of course.
- I need to take a bus.

252
00:45:30,468 --> 00:45:33,888
Well, at least let me walk you
to the station.

253
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,599
Okay.

254
00:45:39,978 --> 00:45:42,564
- You have everything you need?
- Yeah.

255
00:45:51,656 --> 00:45:53,658
- Good night.
- Good night.

256
00:45:53,825 --> 00:45:56,161
I hope you get some rest.

257
00:46:38,077 --> 00:46:40,871
We're giving you
a very low dose only.

258
00:46:41,038 --> 00:46:43,582
I need you sharp out there
and disciplined.

259
00:46:43,749 --> 00:46:45,542
First sign of any side effect...

260
00:46:45,709 --> 00:46:49,505
...we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.

261
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,299
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

262
00:46:55,718 --> 00:46:58,554
You'll get two separate infusions.

263
00:46:58,721 --> 00:47:00,556
One into the deep muscle...

264
00:47:00,723 --> 00:47:02,642
...one into the bone-marrow centres.

265
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:05,311
Bone ones are gonna hurt.

266
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:38,052
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

267
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,596
One, two, three, four...

268
00:47:52,024 --> 00:47:54,234
Is everything okay?

269
00:47:55,736 --> 00:47:57,654
I think so.

270
00:48:05,454 --> 00:48:08,248
- Come here.
- What?

271
00:48:08,415 --> 00:48:10,625
I just wanna do this.

272
00:48:11,877 --> 00:48:13,879
- It's better like that.
- Yeah.

273
00:48:18,717 --> 00:48:20,927
- It's too tight, huh?
- Yeah, a little.

274
00:48:21,094 --> 00:48:22,638
Okay.

275
00:48:29,685 --> 00:48:31,187
What?

276
00:48:31,687 --> 00:48:34,023
They're here.
Betty, look at me, look at me.

277
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:37,568
You have to go far away from me.
Don't argue with me, just go, go.

278
00:48:48,454 --> 00:48:50,706
We'd have had snipers on target
in three more minutes.

279
00:48:50,873 --> 00:48:52,833
I wanna know who jumped the gun.

280
00:48:54,168 --> 00:48:55,628
He's heading 270.

281
00:48:57,463 --> 00:48:59,298
Move it.

282
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:14,814
Blonsky, not yet.

283
00:49:15,855 --> 00:49:17,357
Sir.

284
00:49:18,608 --> 00:49:21,236
Look alive,
this could get interesting.

285
00:49:37,585 --> 00:49:38,837
Stop.

286
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:09,533
I got him.

287
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,784
Stop.

288
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:13,370
Stop.

289
00:50:14,538 --> 00:50:15,998
I know you're in there.

290
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:19,501
General, please.

291
00:50:22,379 --> 00:50:24,840
- Sir.
- Dad!

292
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:33,724
Dad, please don't do this.

293
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:35,476
You can't see this clearly.

294
00:50:35,643 --> 00:50:37,728
- Now, get inside.
- There he is.

295
00:50:38,062 --> 00:50:40,064
<i>Target is in the overpass.
We have a visual.</i>

296
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:42,650
Do not engage.
Repeat, do not engage.

297
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,865
<i>He's lock ed in.</i>

298
00:50:55,995 --> 00:50:59,165
- Put two canisters in there with him.
- Fire.

299
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:19,602
Get her back here.

300
00:51:54,094 --> 00:51:55,137
Now she'll see.

301
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:19,077
Alpha Team.

302
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:23,165
Let him have all of it.

303
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:30,504
Light him up.
Come on, light him up.

304
00:52:33,257 --> 00:52:37,136
Where are the.50 cals?
Move your asses.

305
00:52:56,489 --> 00:52:57,531
Fall back.

306
00:53:24,849 --> 00:53:25,892
Oh, my God.

307
00:53:29,396 --> 00:53:31,564
- Blonsky, now you're up.
- Yes, sir.

308
00:53:33,733 --> 00:53:35,485
Cover me.

309
00:53:53,086 --> 00:53:54,754
Remember me?

310
00:54:14,481 --> 00:54:15,816
My God, he's doing it.

311
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:23,115
Move him toward the cannons.

312
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:29,663
Move.

313
00:54:43,135 --> 00:54:45,471
- All good.
- Do it, now.

314
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:14,499
- Please, please, please, no, please.
- Get her back.

315
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:17,919
You're killing him! Stop!
Get off of me!

316
00:55:55,872 --> 00:55:57,040
Where's the gunship?

317
00:56:17,102 --> 00:56:20,147
- Is that it?
- Blonsky, pull back now.

318
00:56:20,314 --> 00:56:22,315
<i>Pull back.</i>

319
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:27,069
Is that all you got?

320
00:56:33,993 --> 00:56:35,369
- Fall back.
- Fall back.

321
00:56:35,536 --> 00:56:37,580
- Let's go, let's go.
- Find cover.

322
00:56:37,747 --> 00:56:40,916
- Move back, get down.
- Move it.

323
00:56:42,043 --> 00:56:43,544
Betty!

324
00:56:43,711 --> 00:56:46,088
- Move it, move it, move it.
- Take cover.

325
00:56:56,682 --> 00:56:58,267
Fire, goddamn it.

326
00:57:00,102 --> 00:57:01,854
Bruce.

327
00:57:14,616 --> 00:57:15,700
Stop firing!

328
00:57:29,172 --> 00:57:30,924
No!

329
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:23,392
You did the right thing, calling me.

330
00:58:25,352 --> 00:58:27,771
I need to know where they're going.

331
00:58:28,355 --> 00:58:30,357
She's in danger
as long as she's with him.

332
00:58:30,524 --> 00:58:33,861
From who? He protected her.

333
00:58:34,361 --> 00:58:35,404
You almost killed her.

334
00:58:35,571 --> 00:58:38,824
I give you my word, her safety
is my main concern at this point.

335
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:42,035
You know, it's a point
of professional pride with me...

336
00:58:42,201 --> 00:58:45,163
...that I can always tell
when somebody's lying.

337
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:46,706
And you are.

338
00:58:47,749 --> 00:58:50,126
I don't know where he's going.

339
00:58:51,085 --> 00:58:55,340
- I know she'll help him if she can.
- Then she's aiding a fugitive.

340
00:58:56,507 --> 00:58:59,052
And I can't help either one of them.

341
00:59:04,057 --> 00:59:07,060
I used to wonder
why she never talked about you.

342
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,520
Now I know.

343
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:16,402
Where does she meet these guys?

344
01:00:05,784 --> 01:00:07,286
Bruce?

345
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:19,046
Bruce?

346
01:00:38,232 --> 01:00:40,818
It's okay, it's okay.

347
01:00:53,623 --> 01:00:57,335
Come here. Come this way.

348
01:00:59,629 --> 01:01:00,671
Watch your head.

349
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:30,367
We're okay.

350
01:01:34,579 --> 01:01:36,456
It's okay.

351
01:01:37,749 --> 01:01:40,085
It's just the rain.

352
01:01:48,718 --> 01:01:50,678
Will he ever walk again?

353
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:53,847
Most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now.

354
01:01:54,598 --> 01:01:56,016
I will say this for him.

355
01:01:56,183 --> 01:01:58,394
He's got a heart like a machine.

356
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,355
Never seen anything like it
outside of a racehorse.

357
01:03:04,292 --> 01:03:06,002
Here.

358
01:03:48,794 --> 01:03:49,836
Bruce?

359
01:03:51,546 --> 01:03:52,839
Oh, hi.

360
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:57,844
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, actually I feel a lot better.

361
01:03:58,762 --> 01:04:01,723
- Good.
- I just had to get my data back.

362
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:05,519
- You ate it?
- Well, you know...

363
01:04:05,686 --> 01:04:08,188
...the circumstances called for
a little improvisation.

364
01:04:10,857 --> 01:04:14,193
Okay, so they didn't have a great
selection but I got you a few options.

365
01:04:15,403 --> 01:04:16,612
First things first.

366
01:04:18,364 --> 01:04:19,824
Oh, you're kidding me.

367
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:32,878
- What?
- No.

368
01:04:33,045 --> 01:04:35,965
- They were the stretchiest pair.
- I'll take my chances.

369
01:04:36,132 --> 01:04:38,384
<i>Rumours continue to swirl
about a violent clash...</i>

370
01:04:38,551 --> 01:04:42,346
<i>... between forces of the U.S. Military
and an unknown adversary...</i>

371
01:04:42,513 --> 01:04:45,391
<i>... on the campus of Culver University
earlier today.</i>

372
01:04:45,558 --> 01:04:48,894
<i>Sophomores Jack McGee and Jim
Wilson witnessed some of the battle.</i>

373
01:04:49,061 --> 01:04:50,354
<i>It was so big.</i>

374
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:53,357
<i>- It was lik e this huge, lik e, hulk.
- Yeah.</i>

375
01:04:53,524 --> 01:04:56,444
<i>McGee, who happens to be
a reporter for the campus paper...</i>

376
01:04:56,611 --> 01:04:58,404
<i>... captured this on his cell phone.</i>

377
01:04:58,571 --> 01:05:01,114
<i>Further search for the mysterious hulk
was postponed...</i>

378
01:05:01,281 --> 01:05:04,743
<i>... by powerful thunderstorms in
the Smoky Mountain National Forest.</i>

379
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:14,419
Take short back there, okay?

380
01:05:15,253 --> 01:05:18,089
I have done this before, you know.

381
01:05:33,271 --> 01:05:36,191
I don't know how you've done this
on your own for all this time.

382
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:38,944
With clippers, usually.

383
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,123
Wait, wait, wait.

384
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:37,166
- What?
- We can't do this.

385
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:40,211
- It's okay, I want to.
- No.

386
01:06:40,378 --> 01:06:41,838
No.

387
01:06:42,797 --> 01:06:44,424
I can't.

388
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:50,138
I can't get too excited.

389
01:06:52,265 --> 01:06:54,934
Not even a little excited?

390
01:06:56,936 --> 01:06:59,147
It's okay.

391
01:07:03,234 --> 01:07:05,069
Sir, it's Blonsky.

392
01:07:07,322 --> 01:07:09,741
Has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family?

393
01:07:11,284 --> 01:07:13,244
You can ask him yourself.

394
01:07:16,748 --> 01:07:17,874
Sir?

395
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:40,228
Good to see you
back on your feet, soldier.

396
01:07:40,395 --> 01:07:42,230
Thank you, sir.

397
01:07:48,946 --> 01:07:50,447
How do you feel?

398
01:07:52,282 --> 01:07:55,285
Pissed off and ready for round three.

399
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:04,962
Basically, we can't use any of this,
because they can track all of it.

400
01:08:05,128 --> 01:08:08,422
Well, my lip gloss,
can they track that?

401
01:08:08,965 --> 01:08:11,968
- No, you can take your lip gloss.
- Thank you.

402
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:13,970
Well, I need my glasses.

403
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:16,597
Well, you can take your glasses
and your watch, okay?

404
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:20,101
We can use most of it, we just
can't use the credit cards, ID or phone.

405
01:08:20,268 --> 01:08:22,311
- Don't even turn that on.
- Okay.

406
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:24,146
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

407
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:26,315
How are we gonna get
where we need to go...

408
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:29,110
...on $40 and no credit cards?

409
01:08:31,654 --> 01:08:35,491
- Well, we could sell this.
- No.

410
01:08:35,658 --> 01:08:39,161
No, that's the only thing you have
left from her. No.

411
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:42,873
Well, we'll have to try
and get it back.

412
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:45,459
Federals are already monitoring...

413
01:08:45,626 --> 01:08:47,920
...phones, plastic,
and Dr. Ross' web account.

414
01:08:48,087 --> 01:08:50,089
And local P.D.
Have been placed on alert.

415
01:08:50,256 --> 01:08:53,342
They'll pop up somewhere, and
when they do it comes straight to us.

416
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:55,052
They're not gonna just pop up.

417
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:58,471
He made it 5 years and got across
borders without making any mistakes.

418
01:08:58,638 --> 01:09:00,181
He's not gonna use a credit card.

419
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:02,517
<i>If he was trying to escape,
he'd be long gone.</i>

420
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:04,978
<i>He's not trying to escape,
he's looking for help.</i>

421
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:07,856
<i>That's how we're gonna get him.
We know what they're after.</i>

422
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:11,359
<i>He's been talking to somebody. You'll
have copies of the correspondence.</i>

423
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:13,194
<i>Aliases Mr. Green and Mr. Blue...</i>

424
01:09:13,361 --> 01:09:16,156
<i>... have been added to
the S.H.I.E.L.D. Operations database.</i>

425
01:09:16,323 --> 01:09:18,783
<i>If he comes up for air,
we'll be waiting.</i>

426
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:20,535
<i>If he mak es a peep we'll hear him.</i>

427
01:09:21,703 --> 01:09:23,788
<i>And when he slips up,
we'll be ready.</i>

428
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:11,502
Smile.

429
01:10:21,595 --> 01:10:23,639
What is it like?

430
01:10:25,099 --> 01:10:27,559
When it happens,
what do you experience?

431
01:10:28,435 --> 01:10:31,354
Do you remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?

432
01:10:31,521 --> 01:10:33,815
Those induced hallucinations?

433
01:10:34,148 --> 01:10:38,569
It's a lot like that.
It's a thousand times amplified.

434
01:10:39,404 --> 01:10:42,615
It's like someone's poured
a litre of acid into my brain.

435
01:10:43,408 --> 01:10:48,246
- Do you remember anything?
- Just fragments, images.

436
01:10:48,705 --> 01:10:51,791
There's too much noise,
I can never derive anything out of it.

437
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:56,671
- But then it's still you inside it.
- No, it's not.

438
01:10:57,964 --> 01:10:59,007
I don't know.

439
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:02,218
In the cave, I really felt like
it knew me.

440
01:11:02,885 --> 01:11:04,262
Maybe your mind is in there.

441
01:11:04,429 --> 01:11:07,056
It's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.

442
01:11:07,223 --> 01:11:10,226
I don't wanna control it.
I wanna get rid of it.

443
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:27,534
- You ready?
- Let's even the playing field a little.

444
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:32,164
Gentlemen?

445
01:11:35,626 --> 01:11:37,169
Bruce, wake up.

446
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:39,838
There's something going on.

447
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:53,018
We gotta go, walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.

448
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,952
All right, come.

449
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:29,095
It is a long way uptown. I think
the subway is probably quickest.

450
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,264
Me in a metal tube,
deep underground...

451
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,975
...with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city?

452
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,894
Right, let's get a cab.

453
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:38,896
Come on, now. Let's go.

454
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,857
You're too slow,
you drive like a woman.

455
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,738
- Very nice, you see her?
- Oh, my God.

456
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,241
She's very pretty.
Look out, you goat.

457
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,575
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

458
01:12:56,162 --> 01:12:59,249
Are you out of your mind?
What is wrong with you?

459
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:02,085
What's the matter, baby?
You don't like a good ride?

460
01:13:03,753 --> 01:13:05,922
Asshole!

461
01:13:08,341 --> 01:13:12,095
I know a few techniques could help
you manage that anger very effectively.

462
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:13,930
You, zip it.

463
01:13:14,097 --> 01:13:17,267
- We're walking.
- Okay.

464
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:25,734
Excuse me, Dr. Sterns.

465
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,277
- Yes?
- I'm sorry to bother you.

466
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:28,528
I'm Elizabeth Ross.

467
01:13:30,363 --> 01:13:31,406
Dr. Ross.

468
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,450
I have someone
who'd like to meet you.

469
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:34,909
Okay.

470
01:13:37,245 --> 01:13:38,621
It's Mr. Blue, isn't it?

471
01:13:40,414 --> 01:13:42,333
Mr. Green?

472
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:47,588
I've gotta tell you, I've been wondering
if you were even real.

473
01:13:47,755 --> 01:13:49,965
And if you were,
what would it look like?

474
01:13:50,132 --> 01:13:54,219
A person with that much power
lurking in him.

475
01:13:54,386 --> 01:13:56,138
Nothing could have
surprised me more...

476
01:13:56,305 --> 01:13:58,891
...than this unassuming man
shaking my hand.

477
01:13:59,058 --> 01:14:01,810
But look, we're not strolling in the park
for a picnic here.

478
01:14:01,977 --> 01:14:04,980
Even if everything goes perfectly,
if we induce an episode...

479
01:14:05,147 --> 01:14:10,069
...if we get the dosage exactly right,
is that gonna be a lasting cure?

480
01:14:10,235 --> 01:14:14,698
Or just some antidote
to suppress that specific flare-up?

481
01:14:15,991 --> 01:14:17,117
I don't know.

482
01:14:18,452 --> 01:14:19,495
What I'm saying is...

483
01:14:19,662 --> 01:14:23,707
...that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer...

484
01:14:23,874 --> 01:14:28,670
...we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity...

485
01:14:28,836 --> 01:14:32,048
- You mean it could kill him?
- Kill him, yeah.

486
01:14:32,465 --> 01:14:33,508
I should say so.

487
01:14:35,009 --> 01:14:37,178
You should know
there's a flipside to this too.

488
01:14:37,345 --> 01:14:39,639
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me...

489
01:14:39,806 --> 01:14:43,518
...and it fails, this will be
very dangerous for you.

490
01:14:45,228 --> 01:14:49,107
Look, I've always been
more curious than cautious.

491
01:14:49,274 --> 01:14:51,150
And that's served me pretty well.

492
01:14:51,317 --> 01:14:54,362
So are we gonna do this?

493
01:15:48,665 --> 01:15:50,917
How are you feeling, man?

494
01:15:52,002 --> 01:15:54,296
Like a monster.

495
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,858
Okay, on the table.

496
01:16:16,025 --> 01:16:18,027
These will protect you
from yourself...

497
01:16:18,194 --> 01:16:22,365
...if you have a strong reaction.

498
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:25,660
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.

499
01:16:29,956 --> 01:16:31,874
Oh, come on.

500
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:35,086
Stupid graduate students.

501
01:16:39,048 --> 01:16:42,301
Okay. You. You. You.

502
01:16:43,678 --> 01:16:47,597
This will be a somewhat
novel sensation.

503
01:16:49,766 --> 01:16:51,393
We have begun.

504
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:56,147
The dialysis machine will mix
the antidote with your blood.

505
01:16:56,314 --> 01:17:00,485
So the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved the full reaction.

506
01:17:00,902 --> 01:17:01,945
Just relax.

507
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:06,116
Okay, we are comprehensive.

508
01:17:09,327 --> 01:17:10,787
Here we go.

509
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:22,841
All right, we set to pop?

510
01:17:25,302 --> 01:17:26,636
I'd take your hands off him.

511
01:17:47,197 --> 01:17:49,325
Oh, my God.

512
01:18:03,672 --> 01:18:05,549
Wait, wait, there's more. Wait.

513
01:18:16,143 --> 01:18:18,979
- No. Hang on.
- Wait.

514
01:18:19,146 --> 01:18:20,397
Now do it.

515
01:18:20,564 --> 01:18:21,731
Do it!

516
01:18:28,947 --> 01:18:31,074
Bruce, Bruce, look at me.

517
01:18:31,574 --> 01:18:34,577
Stay with me. The antidote. Now.

518
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:37,246
Sterns, do it now.

519
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:39,540
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.

520
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:41,542
Please look in my eyes.

521
01:18:42,168 --> 01:18:43,836
You've gotta be kidding.

522
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:07,610
- Bruce.
- Oh, my God.

523
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:22,791
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?

524
01:19:25,836 --> 01:19:27,129
Bruce.

525
01:19:35,804 --> 01:19:38,140
It's okay, you're okay.

526
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:40,058
You're okay.

527
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:43,937
You did it.

528
01:19:44,104 --> 01:19:47,941
- He's fine, this is fantastic.
- It's over.

529
01:19:49,192 --> 01:19:52,487
- Hi.
- Hi.

530
01:20:00,036 --> 01:20:06,125
That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life.

531
01:20:06,292 --> 01:20:07,877
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

532
01:20:08,044 --> 01:20:10,171
We need to talk about
what happened in there.

533
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:11,714
Absolutely, okay.

534
01:20:11,881 --> 01:20:13,674
The gamma pulse
came from the amygdala.

535
01:20:13,841 --> 01:20:18,095
I think Dr. Ross' primer lets the cells
absorb the energy temporarily...

536
01:20:18,262 --> 01:20:19,305
...and then it abates.

537
01:20:19,472 --> 01:20:22,141
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago.

538
01:20:22,308 --> 01:20:24,852
Now, maybe we've neutralised
those cells permanently...

539
01:20:25,019 --> 01:20:26,896
...or maybe we just suppressed
that event.

540
01:20:27,063 --> 01:20:29,607
I'm inclined to think the latter,
it's hard to know.

541
01:20:29,774 --> 01:20:31,984
Because none of our test subjects
ever survived.

542
01:20:32,151 --> 01:20:33,694
Wait. What did you just say?

543
01:20:33,861 --> 01:20:36,614
- They weren't getting the primer.
- No, no, test subjects?

544
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:39,492
What test subjects?

545
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,702
Come with me.

546
01:20:58,802 --> 01:21:02,514
- What's the activity level?
- Snipers are covering Alpha Sector.

547
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:06,434
<i>We started on rats and mice,
but it just completely fried them...</i>

548
01:21:06,601 --> 01:21:07,727
<i>... we had to go bigger.</i>

549
01:21:07,894 --> 01:21:09,729
We still don't know
which is more toxic.

550
01:21:09,896 --> 01:21:12,899
- The gamma or your blood.
- What do you mean, my blood?

551
01:21:13,233 --> 01:21:15,235
Bruce, this is all you.

552
01:21:15,402 --> 01:21:17,153
You didn't send me
much to work with...

553
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,531
...so I had to concentrate it
and make more.

554
01:21:19,698 --> 01:21:22,951
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do.

555
01:21:23,118 --> 01:21:26,663
This is potentially Olympian.

556
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:30,208
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.

557
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:32,501
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

558
01:21:32,668 --> 01:21:36,255
We will make humans
impervious to disease.

559
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,604
No, no, we've gotta destroy it.

560
01:21:52,104 --> 01:21:54,440
- Wait, what?
- All of it, tonight.

561
01:21:54,607 --> 01:21:57,359
We're gonna incinerate it.
Is this the whole supply?

562
01:21:57,776 --> 01:21:59,486
We could get the Nobel for this.

563
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:01,739
You don't understand the power
of this thing.

564
01:22:01,905 --> 01:22:04,366
It is too dangerous,
it cannot be controlled.

565
01:22:04,992 --> 01:22:06,285
At your discretion, shooter.

566
01:22:06,452 --> 01:22:08,787
<i>Yeah, but this is Promethean fire.</i>

567
01:22:08,954 --> 01:22:10,289
<i>No shot.</i>

568
01:22:13,876 --> 01:22:15,961
Blonsky is going in.

569
01:22:17,754 --> 01:22:21,132
<i>Blonsky, stand down.
My daughter's in there.</i>

570
01:22:23,301 --> 01:22:26,054
- We have the antidote now.
- They don't want the antidote.

571
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:28,556
They wanna make it a weapon.

572
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:36,272
If we let it go,
we will never get it back.

573
01:22:36,439 --> 01:22:38,733
<i>You have no idea
how powerful this thing is.</i>

574
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,818
I hate the government
as much as anyone.

575
01:22:40,985 --> 01:22:43,446
But you're being a little paranoid,
don't you think?

576
01:22:50,245 --> 01:22:52,497
Bruce, Bruce.

577
01:22:53,456 --> 01:22:54,832
Get out.

578
01:22:57,627 --> 01:23:01,756
Where is it? Come on, where is it?

579
01:23:04,967 --> 01:23:06,176
Show him to me.

580
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:09,304
Blonsky.

581
01:23:17,688 --> 01:23:20,941
Miss, take this.

582
01:23:25,362 --> 01:23:29,491
If you took it from me, I'm gonna put
you in a hole for the rest of your life.

583
01:23:35,789 --> 01:23:37,165
Betty.

584
01:23:38,834 --> 01:23:41,670
I will never forgive
what you have done to him.

585
01:23:41,837 --> 01:23:45,173
- He's a fugitive.
- You made him a fugitive.

586
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:49,386
To cover your failures
and to protect your career.

587
01:23:49,553 --> 01:23:52,013
Don't ever speak to me
as your daughter again.

588
01:23:54,724 --> 01:23:57,977
It's only because you're my daughter
that you're not in handcuffs too.

589
01:24:02,398 --> 01:24:04,525
Are you telling me
you can make more like him?

590
01:24:04,692 --> 01:24:07,820
No, not yet,
I've sorted out a few pieces...

591
01:24:07,987 --> 01:24:10,907
...but it's not like I can put together
the same Humpty Dumpty.

592
01:24:11,073 --> 01:24:12,325
If that's what you're asking.
He was a freak accident.

593
01:24:12,325 --> 01:24:14,493
If that's what you're asking.
He was a freak accident.

594
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:16,579
The goal is to do it better.

595
01:24:16,746 --> 01:24:18,748
So Banner is the only...

596
01:24:22,418 --> 01:24:24,670
Now, she's an annoying bitch.

597
01:24:24,837 --> 01:24:27,924
Why are you always hitting people?

598
01:24:29,342 --> 01:24:34,096
Now, what possibly could I have done
to deserve such aggression?

599
01:24:34,263 --> 01:24:37,308
It's not what you've done,
it's what you're gonna do.

600
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,936
I want what you got
out of Banner, I want that.

601
01:24:44,022 --> 01:24:48,401
You look like you've got a little
something in you already, don't you?

602
01:24:49,444 --> 01:24:53,281
I want more.
You've seen what he becomes, right?

603
01:24:53,907 --> 01:24:55,867
I have.

604
01:24:56,034 --> 01:24:58,078
And it's beautiful.

605
01:24:58,245 --> 01:24:59,287
Godlike.

606
01:24:59,871 --> 01:25:01,998
I want that.

607
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:05,627
Need that. Give me that.

608
01:25:06,586 --> 01:25:08,964
I don't know what you've got
inside you already.

609
01:25:09,798 --> 01:25:13,301
The mixture
could be an abomination.

610
01:25:17,138 --> 01:25:19,933
I didn't say I was unwilling.

611
01:25:20,517 --> 01:25:25,313
I just need informed consent.

612
01:25:26,814 --> 01:25:28,816
And you've given it.

613
01:26:09,773 --> 01:26:13,193
This is what I was trying to explain.

614
01:26:14,027 --> 01:26:18,281
I don't know
what you've been ladling into yourself.

615
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:21,034
But clearly it worked.

616
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,787
Let's assume you don't understand
a word I'm saying...

617
01:26:24,954 --> 01:26:29,834
...but if you'll just get back
on the table...

618
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:33,379
...I can fix this.

619
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:48,937
Shoot it!

620
01:26:49,854 --> 01:26:51,397
No!

621
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:02,407
Delta 4 to leader.

622
01:27:02,574 --> 01:27:04,868
They still got two of our guys.
Two of our guys...

623
01:27:05,035 --> 01:27:07,287
...Blonsky and the major,
are still inside.

624
01:27:10,082 --> 01:27:13,210
Come on, move, move, move.

625
01:27:20,384 --> 01:27:22,427
It's over there!

626
01:27:24,846 --> 01:27:27,432
- What is that thing?
- Shoot it!

627
01:27:36,608 --> 01:27:38,819
Okay, all right. You, you drive.

628
01:27:38,986 --> 01:27:40,279
Let's go. Move, move.

629
01:27:40,445 --> 01:27:41,738
Delta 4 to leader.

630
01:27:41,905 --> 01:27:43,949
Something big
just went off down here.

631
01:27:44,408 --> 01:27:46,368
General, you should hear this.

632
01:27:46,535 --> 01:27:49,537
The hulk is in the street.
I repeat, the hulk is in the street.

633
01:27:52,039 --> 01:27:54,125
That's impossible.
You get ahold of yourself.

634
01:27:54,292 --> 01:27:56,252
You get it together.
What is your position?

635
01:27:56,419 --> 01:27:59,547
121 st Street,
heading north on Broadway.

636
01:27:59,714 --> 01:28:01,632
Turn us around.

637
01:28:08,139 --> 01:28:10,558
We're going back.
Why are we going back?

638
01:28:11,392 --> 01:28:13,144
Damn it, give me eyes down there.

639
01:28:13,311 --> 01:28:14,812
Yes, sir.

640
01:28:16,814 --> 01:28:18,149
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

641
01:28:19,150 --> 01:28:20,651
Go, go, go.

642
01:28:44,257 --> 01:28:45,759
No.

643
01:29:01,691 --> 01:29:02,776
One of yours?

644
01:29:02,943 --> 01:29:05,070
Oh, my God.

645
01:29:05,237 --> 01:29:06,321
What have you done?

646
01:29:08,657 --> 01:29:10,825
Fire! Fire!

647
01:29:14,871 --> 01:29:16,831
You think a rifle's gonna hurt that?

648
01:29:17,374 --> 01:29:19,042
Come on.

649
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:23,379
Sweet.

650
01:29:45,401 --> 01:29:46,694
Get out of there, soldier.

651
01:29:50,489 --> 01:29:52,741
Stand back!

652
01:30:22,353 --> 01:30:24,439
Give me a real fight.

653
01:30:24,606 --> 01:30:26,357
No, no, no!

654
01:30:32,322 --> 01:30:33,823
Sir?

655
01:30:36,075 --> 01:30:37,118
Sir?

656
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,165
Tell them to bring everything
they've got and head for Harlem.

657
01:30:45,335 --> 01:30:47,170
It has to be me.

658
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:50,632
- You have to take me back there.
- What are you saying?

659
01:30:50,798 --> 01:30:52,050
You think you can control...

660
01:30:52,216 --> 01:30:55,219
No, no, not control it,
but, I don't know, maybe aim it.

661
01:30:55,386 --> 01:30:56,720
And what if you can't?

662
01:30:58,597 --> 01:31:00,599
We made this thing.

663
01:31:00,766 --> 01:31:02,434
All of us.

664
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:04,603
Please.

665
01:31:09,191 --> 01:31:10,609
- Land us near it.
- No, no.

666
01:31:10,776 --> 01:31:12,527
No, keep us high.

667
01:31:13,487 --> 01:31:14,947
Open the back door.

668
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:22,371
Bruce. Bruce, stop.

669
01:31:22,579 --> 01:31:24,581
Stop. What are you doing?

670
01:31:25,332 --> 01:31:27,000
Think about this.

671
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:29,002
You don't even know
if you'll change.

672
01:31:31,004 --> 01:31:34,174
You don't have to do this, please.
This is insane.

673
01:31:34,341 --> 01:31:36,510
Betty, I've gotta try.

674
01:31:38,303 --> 01:31:39,513
I'm sorry.

675
01:32:02,326 --> 01:32:04,662
Oh, shit.

676
01:32:07,999 --> 01:32:09,041
Get her in here.

677
01:32:09,834 --> 01:32:11,752
Come on, miss.

678
01:32:28,352 --> 01:32:29,395
There. Betty.

679
01:32:49,122 --> 01:32:50,749
Hulk.

680
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:43,759
Come on.

681
01:34:15,039 --> 01:34:16,666
Is that all you've got?

682
01:34:30,847 --> 01:34:33,558
Use that thing, soldier.
Give him some help.

683
01:34:33,725 --> 01:34:34,934
Which one?

684
01:34:35,101 --> 01:34:36,477
Help the green one, damn it.

685
01:34:36,644 --> 01:34:39,772
Which one do you think?
Cut the other one in half.

686
01:34:41,941 --> 01:34:43,610
Ross.

687
01:35:07,966 --> 01:35:10,052
Keep it on him.

688
01:35:38,121 --> 01:35:39,414
I gotta put it down.

689
01:35:39,581 --> 01:35:41,666
Hang on.

690
01:36:47,898 --> 01:36:49,816
Dad.

691
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,779
Are you hurt? Let me help you.

692
01:37:02,162 --> 01:37:03,997
I'm all right. Just find a way out.

693
01:37:51,794 --> 01:37:55,130
You don't deserve this power.

694
01:37:55,297 --> 01:37:59,218
Now watch her die.

695
01:38:48,932 --> 01:38:51,268
Look out!

696
01:39:21,632 --> 01:39:23,759
General.

697
01:39:29,139 --> 01:39:32,434
Any last words?

698
01:39:34,519 --> 01:39:35,562
Hulk...

699
01:39:37,063 --> 01:39:38,981
...smash!

700
01:40:25,402 --> 01:40:27,362
Stop!

701
01:41:47,816 --> 01:41:49,902
It's okay.

702
01:41:59,285 --> 01:42:02,080
Betty.

703
01:44:29,015 --> 01:44:30,767
<i>Reload.</i>

704
01:44:37,732 --> 01:44:38,775
Reload.

705
01:44:55,125 --> 01:44:58,128
The smell of stale beer and defeat.

706
01:44:58,295 --> 01:45:00,005
You know,
I hate to say I told you so.

707
01:45:00,171 --> 01:45:04,259
But that super soldier programme
was put on ice for a reason.

708
01:45:04,634 --> 01:45:07,219
I've always felt that hardware
was much more reliable.

709
01:45:07,678 --> 01:45:09,305
Stark.

710
01:45:09,471 --> 01:45:11,056
General.

711
01:45:12,266 --> 01:45:14,810
You always wear such nice suits.

712
01:45:15,895 --> 01:45:17,479
Touch.

713
01:45:18,063 --> 01:45:19,982
I hear you have an unusual problem.

714
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:21,567
You should talk.

715
01:45:21,984 --> 01:45:23,777
You should listen.

716
01:45:26,155 --> 01:45:28,824
What if I told you
we're putting a team together?

717
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:31,160
Who's we?

718
01:45:32,305 --> 01:46:32,162
