2
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:44,162
Minister: Do you, Ethan, take Julia
to be your lawful wedded wife?

3
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,253
I do.

4
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:50,206
To have, to hold,
to love, Cherish, honor, and protect?

5
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,756
I do.

6
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,961
Minister: To shield from terrors known
and unknown?

7
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,139
- To lie, to deceive...
“what?

8
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:03,219
To live a double life,
to fail to prevent her abduction,

9
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,931
erase her identity,
force her into hiding,

10
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,481
take away all she has known...

11
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,569
Stop.

12
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,214
In a selfish, futile,
fleeting attempt...

13
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,318
Stop.

14
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,943
To escape your own true self?

15
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,068
Please, stop.

16
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,491
And, Julia, do you choose to accept?

17
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,579
Don't.

18
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,120
- I do.
- No.

19
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,706
You should have killed me, Ethan.

20
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,375
(Explosion in distance)

21
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,669
(Sighs)

22
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,049
(Knock at door)

23
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,475
(Thunder rumbling)

24
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,727
(Knocking continues)

25
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,780
Fate whispers to the warrior...

26
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,274
Ethan: A storm is coming.

27
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,611
Deliveryman:
And the warrior whispers back...

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,621
I am the storm.

29
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,783
(Thunder rumbling)

30
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,693
(Device beeping)

31
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,858
Man: (On speaker)
Good evening, Mr. hunt.

32
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,160
The anarchist Solomon Lane.

33
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,200
Since you captured him 2 years ago,

34
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,375
his absence from the world stage
has had unintended consequences.

35
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,123
His syndicate of rogue covert operatives

36
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,956
continues to wreak havoc
around the globe.

37
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,915
The CIA's special activities division

38
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,127
has relentlessly hunted Lane's
elite network of hosliles.

39
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,554
But many remain unknown and at large.

40
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,764
The remnants of this
extremist splinter cell

41
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,263
refer to themselves as "the apostles.”

42
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,430
they have since adopted
a policy of terror-for-hire,

43
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,766
making them an even greater threat.

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,192
They are responsible for
the recent smallpox outbreak

45
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,610
in Indian-controlled kashmir,

46
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,984
along the borders of China and Pakistan,

47
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,441
threatening one-third
of the world's population.

48
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,527
The epidemic is being contained,

49
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,077
but intelligence would indicate

50
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:30,533
that a new client has hired the apostles
for a more ambitious operation.

51
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,367
They have been contacted by this man,

52
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,171
an unidentified extremist
known only by the code name John lark,

53
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,340
author of this apocalyptic manifesto

54
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,840
calling for the destruction
of the current world order.

55
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,717
It is believed lark is responsible
for the disappearance

56
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,971
of Norwegian nuclear weapons
specialist nils delbruuk.

57
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,143
Dr. delbruuk's security
clearance was revoked

58
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,142
after he expressed
fiercely anti-religious views.

59
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,224
Meanwhile, the apostles
have been in contact

60
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,559
with elements of
the eastern European underworld,

61
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,020
who are in possession
of three plutonium cores

62
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,857
stolen from a missile base
in eastern Russia.

63
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,776
This would indicate that
John lark and the apostles

64
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,705
are working together
to acquire functioning nuclear weapons.

65
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,574
Nest estimates that a man
with delbruuk"s knowledge,

66
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,954
using the materials in play,

67
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,414
could complete three nuclear weapons
in as little as 72 hours.

68
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,214
These devices would be man-portable

69
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,793
and deployable anywhere
on earth overnight.

70
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,379
In the hands of John lark
and the apostles,

71
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,760
these weapons represent
an unprecedented threat

72
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,557
to countless millions.

73
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,347
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

74
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,021
is to prevent the apostles
from acquiring plutonium

75
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,599
using any means at your disposal.

76
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:41,441
If you or any members of your imf team
are caught or killed,

77
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,568
the secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.

78
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,739
Good luck, Ethan.

79
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,944
This message will
self-destruct in five seconds.

80
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,909
(Rain pattering)

81
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,539
(Sizzles)

82
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,426
He's late.

83
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,547
- He's never late.
- He'll be here.

84
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,007
I don't like it.

85
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,677
Something about this guy
just really gives me the creeps.

86
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,763
Okay, just relax.

87
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,188
I'm relaxed.

88
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,355
You don't sound relaxed.

89
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,837
Luther, does he sound relaxed to you?

90
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,817
(Chuckles) He sounds terrified.

91
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,509
Benji: Please, I'm not terrified.
I just have a bad feeling is all.

92
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,273
Luther: / thought you said
you were relaxed.

93
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,860
It's entirely possible to be relaxed
and extremely uneasy at the same time.

94
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,786
- No, it's not.
You do it all the time.

95
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,454
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

96
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,657
No, he doesn't.

97
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,687
I'm supposed to believe that
you are perfectly relaxed,

98
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,121
- right here, now...
- Beniji.

99
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,357
In a dark alleyway, waiting to buy

100
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,542
black-market plutonium
from a psychopath.

101
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,294
Benji, I won't let anything
happen to you.

102
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,795
- (Scoffs) Okay.
Luther: See, Benji,

103
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,217
you're perfectly safe.

104
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,169
That's easy for you to say,
you're in the Van.

105
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,076
Well, you wanted to be
in the field, tough guy.

106
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,136
And tonight, Luther,
I would like to be in the Van!

107
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,827
- (Tires squeal in distance)
- He's here.

108
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,390
Oh, god. (Clears throat)

109
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,943
(Car doors opening)

110
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,780
(Car doors close)

111
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,118
Ethan: Have that money ready, Luther.

112
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,452
Luther: Copy.

113
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,542
Ethan, do you copy?

114
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,203
Do you copy?

115
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:23,918
(Gasps)

116
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,142
Are we finally gonna
do this or not?

117
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:46,319
I have survived in this business
with the help of a voice in my head.

118
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,483
This voice is never wrong.
And whenever I meet you,

119
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,781
it tells me the same thing.

120
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,831
What's that?

121
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,081
Nothing.

122
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,627
I'm here to do business.
Tell the voice to flip a coin.

123
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,535
(Device beeping)

124
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,154
(Device trilling)

125
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,413
What's that?

126
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,784
This is a beryllium rod,
which is causing

127
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,790
a reaction with the plutonium
inside the core.

128
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,538
(Continues trilling)

129
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,013
That's them.

130
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,016
The money?

131
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,686
The money.

132
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,857
Bring the money.

133
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,030
Luther, bring the money.

134
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,708
We're gonna need
that money, Luther.

135
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,629
Kill them.

136
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,052
(Gunshots)

137
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,095
- (Shoutys)
(Gunshots)

138
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,223
I got it!

139
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,471
Luther, do you copy?

140
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,691
Luther!

141
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,190
Luther, come in.

142
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,100
Man: Luther's not here right now.

143
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,528
What can the apostles
do for you, hunt?

144
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,901
- What do you want?
- You're boxed in, hunt.

145
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,489
Give us the plutonium
and walk away.

146
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,616
Benji, get the car.

147
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,288
- I don't think I can do that.
- Beniji.

148
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,081
Get the car.

149
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,454
(Car engine starts)

150
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,211
(Gun firing)

151
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,390
(Grunts)

152
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,308
Man: We'll make you a deal, hunt.

153
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,233
Give us the plutonium
and we won't kill your friend.

154
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,734
Don't you do it, Ethan! Not for me!

155
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,457
- (Panting)
- Man: I'm gonna count to three.

156
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,341
One.

157
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,755
- Two.
- Luther...

158
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,927
- 'M sorry.
- Three.

159
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,185
(Groans softly)

160
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,025
(Breathing heavily)

161
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,403
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what else to do.

162
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,855
(Strained) We're good.

163
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,449
(Coughing)

164
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,573
- You okay?
- I should be dead.

165
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,575
We should all be dead.

166
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,907
Why aren't we?

167
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,951
Where's the plutonium?

168
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,598
It's gone.

169
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,500
Wolf blitzer: (On TV)
If you're just joining us,

170
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:53,813
three massive explosions
have gone off simultaneously

171
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,777
this image is live in Rome,
looking toward the Vatican

172
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,200
and is as close as our cameras can get.

173
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,404
It is believed that
the pope was in residence

174
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,738
at the time of the blast.

175
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,917
Also live, we're looking at Jerusalem
from just outside the city.

176
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,290
Also live, the holy city of mecca

177
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,918
from the USS Ronald Reagan
in the red sea

178
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,125
off the coast of Saudi Arabia.

179
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,210
Radiation has been detected,

180
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,342
indicating that
nuclear weapons were used

181
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,219
in these unspeakable attacks.

182
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,471
Luther: Ethan, it's time.

183
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,998
No word on casualties yet,
but we can assume

184
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,683
the death toll is catastrophic.

185
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,098
Early reports suggest
the weapons used

186
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,684
would require
highly specialized knowledge

187
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,393
that very few people possess.

188
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:42,653
The question now is who would attack
all three of these holy sites? And why?

189
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,160
The attacks occurred
at precisely the same moment,

190
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,407
just over an hour ago,

191
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,322
at 4:00 A.M. eastern time.

192
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,978
- Within minutes of the attack...
- (Chuckling)

193
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,368
Congress ordered
an emergency recess

194
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,124
and the capitol building
was evacuated.

195
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,002
The president left Washington
on air force one.

196
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,378
The white house has declared
a state of emergency,

197
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,756
placing the military on highest alert.

198
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,963
Would you excuse us, please?

199
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,261
Dr. delbruuk.

200
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,884
(Machine beeping)

201
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,306
Ethan: We know who you are.

202
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,184
We read the manifesto,
we found your lab.

203
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,354
(Sniffles)

204
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,561
(Indistinct announcement
on pa)

205
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,075
"There has never been peace

206
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,153
"without first a great suffering.

207
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,614
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace."

208
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,036
See, this will unite them, hmm?

209
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,794
When they read this manifesto,
they'll all understand.

210
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,588
Nobody's gonna read
that manifesto, ever.

211
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,541
I can promise you that.

212
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:42,967
Delbruuk: What day is it?

213
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,627
How long have I been here?

214
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,342
What's the last thing you remember?

215
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,474
(Stammers) I was driving.

216
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,479
Someone hit me.

217
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,224
That was two weeks ago.

218
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,230
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks.

219
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,148
Luther: This is yours, isn't it?

220
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,644
It's how lark communicated with you.

221
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,195
- (Sniffles) Lark?
- Ethan: John lark.

222
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,524
- We know all about him.
- You know nothing.

223
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,298
Luther: There's information in this
phone that could lead us to him.

224
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,035
And you have the passcode.

225
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,409
You think lark is the enemy, hmm?

226
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,832
But you,

227
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,956
well, whoever you are,
you are the enemy.

228
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,628
You're why the system survives.

229
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,669
- Why the suffering goes on.
- Shut up!

230
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,172
We don't care about you.
We want lark.

231
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,503
What if we make a deal?

232
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,997
Ethan: No, there's no deal, Luther.

233
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,926
Step outside.

234
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,346
Give me five minutes with this guy.

235
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,928
Ethan, I can't let you do that.
That's not who we are.

236
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,560
Then maybe we need to reconsider that.

237
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,982
What if they read
the manifesto on the air?

238
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,069
What? You can do that?

239
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,735
We can do it with a phone call.

240
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,651
Delbruuk: Well, if he reads
lark's manifesto...

241
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,743
No.

242
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,533
(Laughing) I'll give you the passcode.

243
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,611
Luther: Ethan! Ethan!

244
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,409
(Laughing)
- Think, Ethan.

245
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,285
Think of the greater good, please.

246
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,158
Yeah, you do that.

247
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,876
(Grunts)

248
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,630
(Continues laughing)

249
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,837
Hmm?

250
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,128
(Indistinct announcement on pa)

251
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,933
Ethan: Sir.

252
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,179
No, he won't cooperate.

253
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,021
Yes, sir. If we read the manifesto

254
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,560
on the air.

255
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,560
I'm sorry, sir.

256
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,321
(Line disconnects)

257
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,655
Wolf blitzer: (On TV)
Trading and global markets plummeted.

258
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:39,664
Stand by. I'm told we're about
fo get some additional information.

259
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:44,251
I've just been handed a document
from nils delbruuk,

260
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,298
a nuclear weapons specialist

261
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,423
who claims to have built the weapons
used in these attacks.

262
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,640
I've been asked to read
this manifesto in its entirety.

263
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,720
"There has never been peace

264
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,473
"without first a great suffering.

265
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,805
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace.

266
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,934
(Laughing)

267
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,937
"As mankind is drawn
to his self-destruction

268
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,768
"like a moth to the candle,

269
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,728
"the so-called defenders of peace,

"the church, the government, the law,

271
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,735
"work tirelessly
to save humanity from itself.”

272
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,366
it's not gonna help you now.

273
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,242
"But by averting disaster,

274
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,948
"they serve to delay a peace...”

275
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,249
what's done is done.

276
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,419
"That can only come through
an inevitable baptism of fire.

277
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,714
"The suffering I bring you
is not the beginning of the end.

278
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:27,881
"It is the beginning

279
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,321
"of a greater mutual understanding...”

280
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,676
did we get it?

281
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,122
Wolf blitzer: “it is the first step

282
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,618
"toward the ultimate
brotherhood of man.”

283
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,757

"The suffering I bring you

00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,730
Go.

287
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,978
(Thudding)

288
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,064
(Gasps)

289
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,031
Did we get it?

290
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,703
Of course we got it.

291
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,463
I told you we'd get it.

292
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,878
I... I don't understand.

293
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,134
The attacks didn't happen?

294
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,930
The car accident you were in,
that was an hour ago.

295
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,803
I was driving the other car.

296
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,059
Ethan: What's done is done,

297
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,886
when we say it's done.

298
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,098
(Mission: Impossible theme playing)

299
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,013
Sir.

300
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,135
That phone you unlocked led us
to a server in Iceland

301
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,091
where we managed to
decrypt a communiqué

302
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,768
between John lark
and this woman:

303
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,312
Alana mitsopolis,
activist and philanthropist,

304
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,515
whose charity work

305
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,045
has earned her
the nickname the white widow.

306
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,687
It's all a front for her real trade:
Arms dealing, money laundering.

307
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,318
Extensive political connections
provide her with protection.

308
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,844
Lark and the widow
are meeting tonight

309
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,951
to negotiate delivery
of an unspecified package,

310
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,905
which we can only assume
is our missing plutonium.

311
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,992
They'll make contact in a private lounge
at the grand palais in Paris

312
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,576
during her annual
fundraising event.

313
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,877
The details are in the file.

314
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,191
If lark isn't there by midnight,

315
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,171
the widow will leave

316
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,939
and sell the package
to the highest bidder.

317
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,507
Which gives you
two hours from now to find lark.

318
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,930
Sir, I think there's something
you need to know.

319
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,632
I'm gonna stop you right there.

320
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,469
You had a terrible choice
to make in Berlin:

321
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,269
Recover the plutonium or save your team.

322
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,316
You chose your team,
and now the world is at risk.

323
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,146
Some flaw deep in your core being

324
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,650
simply won't allow you to choose
between one life and millions.

325
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,356
You see that as a sign of weakness.

326
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,067
To me, that's your greatest strength.

327
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,904
It also tells me I can count on you
to cover my ass.

328
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,434
Because coming over here from the CIA

329
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,164
was a lateral move,
some say a step down.

330
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,661
But I did it

331
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,663
because of you.

332
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,829
Don't make me regret it.

333
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,433
Make the call.

334
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,392
Walker: Shut 'em down.

335
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,352
(Plane engines power down)

336
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,388
What do you think you're doing, Erika?

337
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,902
It may be your mission,

338
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,079
but this is the CIA's plane.

339
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,872
It doesn't take off without my say-so.

340
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,199
We don't have time for this.

341
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,159
I have a team in Paris
ready to grab lark

342
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,790
as soon as he leaves the palais.

343
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,748
A g5 standing by
to rendition him to gitmo,

344
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,042
where a waterboard is waiting.

345
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,586
Spend 24 hours we don't have
to pull a confession we can't trust

346
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,844
from a man we haven't
positively identified? No.

347
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,596
We need reliable intelligence,
and we need it now.

348
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,349
This scenario is precisely
why the imf exists!

349
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,805
The imf is Halloween, Alan.

350
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,609
A bunch of grown men in rubber masks
playing trick-or-treat.

351
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,153
And if he had held on to
the plutonium in Berlin,

352
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,276
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

353
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,719
Hunley: And his team would be dead.

354
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,699
Yes. They would.

355
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,118
That's the job.

356
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,697
And that's why I want
one of my own men on the scene

357
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,828
to appraise the situation.

358
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,494
Agent Walker,
special activities.

359
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,000
His reputation precedes.

360
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,797
Sloane: You use a scalpel.

361
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,466
I prefer a hammer.

362
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,714
Hunley: The answer is no.

363
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,512
I have operational authority here,
direct from the president.

364
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,868
You have a problem with that,
you take it up with him.

365
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,476
I have already, and he agrees
with me. My man goes

366
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,599
or no one goes.

367
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,647
No one comes between
you and that plutonium.

368
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,779
Not hunt, not his team, not anyone.

369
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,134
Ethan: The white widow has spies
at every level of government.

370
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,636
This plane is posing
as a commercial airliner

371
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,888
so we can jump into France undetected.

372
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,055
The widow's meeting lark
in the vip lounge at midnight.

373
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,141
No one will be admitted without
a pre-issued electronic I.D. Band.

374
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,605
We have acquired
the unique rfid number

375
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,687
for lark's band,
allowing us to locate it

376
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,738
with these.

377
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,316
Find that I.D. Band, you find lark.

378
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,493
Then what?

379
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,490
- Then...
- (Device humming)

380
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,786
I assume his identity
and make contact with the widow.

381
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,290
She takes us to the package.

382
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,461
People actually fall for this shit?

383
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,793
How do you intend
to make lark cooperate?

384
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,551
I bump him in the crowd.

385
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,633
In ten seconds he'll look like
any other drunk at the party,

386
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,559
incoherent and completely pliable.

387
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,186
After I borrow his face,

388
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,153
you walk him out the front door and
hand him to Sloane's extraction team.

389
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,226
You're not getting rid of me
that easily, hunt.

390
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,981
That's not what this is about.

391
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,778
Sure itis.

392
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,652
I know you don't want me
on this detail.

393
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,324
But let's face it:

394
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,242
If you'd made
the hard choice in Berlin,

395
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,740
I wouldn't be here.

396
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,163
And if you hadn't gunned down

397
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,332
every syndicate agent
they sent you to find,

398
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,958
I wouldn't be here.

399
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,327
That's right, I know all about you.

400
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,414
You're why we don't have a living
witness who can identify John lark

401
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,215
or the apostles.

402
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,839
If you have a problem
with my methods,

403
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,886
you can always stay behind.

404
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:33,466
"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it."

405
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,347
Isn't that the thing?

406
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,677
(Alarm blaring)

407
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,774
Pilot: (On intercom)
Two minutes to decompression.

408
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,642
Suit up. The widow is meeting lark
in 30 minutes.

409
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,331
(Air hissing)

410
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,410
Pilot: Ten seconds to decompression.

411
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,873
Is your oxygen on?

412
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,385
There is no atmosphere
at this altitude.

413
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,258
I don't need you
blacking out on me.

414
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,555
(Door opens)

415
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,889
Hey, your heads-up display has
a built-in guidance system.

416
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,021
Open your chute when the system says,

417
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,769
not before and definitely not after,

418
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,546
or the last thing that
goes through your mind

419
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,356
will be your kneecaps. Is that clear?

420
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,527
Crystal.

421
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,869
(Thunder rumbling)

422
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,840
We got to talk. We need to rethink this.

423
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,216
Out of my way, hunt.

424
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,243
Walker, we've got a problem.
There's a storm. We need to...

425
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,223
- (Air hissing)
- Walker: Enough talk.

426
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,972
I'll see you in Paris.

427
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,388
(Breathing heavily)

428
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,477
Come on, come on, come on.

429
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,616
(Breathing deeply)

430
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,042
Automated voice:
Altitude: 25,000 feet.

431
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,676
Ethan: Walker?

432
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,048
Walker: What's the matter, hunt?
You afraid of a little lightning?

433
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,430
(Grunts)

434
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,601
Automated voice:
Altitude: 20,000 feet.

435
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,273
Ethan: Son of a bitch.

436
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,442
(Panting) Walker?

437
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,274
Do you copy?

438
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,032
Walker?

439
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,280
Walker?

440
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,416
Come on.

441
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,214
Automated voice: Altitude: 15,000 feet.

442
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,798
Walker.

443
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,884
Walker! (Grunts)

444
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,062
Walker!

445
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,231
Walker!

446
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,064
Automated voice: Altitude: 10,000 feet.

447
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,569
(Ethan grunting)

448
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,610
9,000.

449
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,990
Ethan: Oh, shit.

450
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,740
Automated voice: 8,000.

451
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,245
7,000.

452
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,170
6,000.

453
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,837
5,000.

454
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,929
4,000.

455
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,270
Walker!

456
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:05,765
Walker!

457
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,687
3,000.

458
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,182
Deploy. Deploy. Deploy.

459
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,563
Deploy. Deploy. Deploy.

460
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,770
Deploy. Deploy.

461
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,737
(Grunting)

462
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,657
(Panting)

463
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,251
Oh, god.

464
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,373
(Grunting)

465
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,513
(Groans)

466
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,797
(Muffled music playing)

467
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,228
Looks like you lost your oxygen.

468
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,498
(Music playing louder)

469
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,578
(Crowd cheering)

470
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,298
That's where the widow is meeting lark.

471
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,099
(Beeps)

472
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,062
(Crowd cheering)

473
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,028
(Upbeat music playing)

474
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,262
Walker: Ethan.

475
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,379
- Walker.
- Ethan, if you can hear me,

476
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,473
I've got him.

477
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,303
Say again. Where?

478
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,264
He's headed for the bathroom.

479
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,589
(Indistinct chatter)

480
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,521
(Toilet flushes)

481
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,236
(Speaking French)

482
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,783
(Toilet flushes)

483
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,204
(Men speaking French)

484
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,084
(Door closes)

485
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,542
(Both grunting)

486
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,502
- Where's the needle?
- Didn't need it.

487
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,837
- (Indistinct chatter)
- Get him up.

488
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,598
(Indistinct chatter)

489
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,959
Hey, hey. (Shushing)

490
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,123
(Speaking French)

491
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,084
(Device humming)

492
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:45,878
(Indistinct chatter continues)

493
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,050
(Knocking on door)

494
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,430
(Jeering in French)

495
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,189
(Speaking French)

496
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,727
Don't be shy, the more the merrier.

497
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,859
Come on, we re not mean.

498
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:02,891
Can we join you?

499
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,110
Can we join you? We won't bite, guys.

500
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,901
(Indistinct chatter)

501
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,737
(Laughing)

502
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,154
(All singing in French)

503
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,870
(Door opens)

504
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,246
(Door closes)

505
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,585
(All grunting)

506
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,476
(Groans)

507
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,554
(Both grunting)

508
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,709
(Straining)

509
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,377
(Groaning)

510
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:10,960
(Huffs)

511
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,635
(Grunting)

512
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,813
(Groans)

513
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,193
(Grunting)

514
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,780
(Panting)

515
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,076
(Grunting)

516
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,718
- (Gunshot)
(Gasps)

517
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,427
(Panting)

518
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,219
(Whispers) Shit.

519
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,524
(Glass crunching)

520
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,537
- Can you still make a mask?
- I need a face to make a mask.

521
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,916
Sorry. I was aiming for his chest.

522
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,673
- What are you doing here?
- It's good to see you, too.

523
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,297
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
You are...

524
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,796
An old friend.

525
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,856
Walker: Cancel extraction.
We're code blue.

526
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,313
Send sanitation.

527
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,490
North men's room.

528
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,325
You didn't answer my question.
What are you doing here?

529
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,822
(Indistinct chatter)

530
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,375
That's it. Just take it easy.
That's it.

531
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,422
Just keep your head back
until the bleeding stops.

532
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,746
What is it, eh? (Speaks French)

533
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,956
You want some, too?

534
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,964
(In English) You're not here
by accident. Who sent you?

535
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,553
I can't tell you that.

536
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
What are you doing?

537
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,952
I have a date with the white widow.

538
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,467
He had a date with the widow.
You look nothing like him.

539
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,178
And now we have to hope
they never met.

540
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,106
- Hope is not a strategy!
- Oh, you must be new.

541
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,526
I have no other choice.

542
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,191
The white widow's our only lead.

543
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,714
I got to be this guy for five minutes.

544
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,524
- Don't do it.
- Ethan: What?

545
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,611
What is it?
What aren't you telling me?

546
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,388
You don't understand
what you're involved in.

547
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,027
I don't understand
what I'm involved in.

548
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,867
I don't understand
what I'm involved in?

549
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,825
What am I involved in?

550
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,753
If you're meeting the widow,
she leaves in three minutes.

551
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,706
Ilsa: Ethan!
Ethan: I'll make it work.

552
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,507
- Ethan!
- I'll make it work.

553
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,428
The name's Walker.

554
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,631
Yeah? You're welcome.

555
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,851
(Dance music playing)

556
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,232
(Beeping)

557
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,014
What do you think you're doing?

558
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,640
- I'm going with you.
- Like hell you are.

559
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,808
People have been sent here to kill lark.

560
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,832
No shit.

561
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,032
No, not me. Contractors. Paid assassins.

562
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,861
They don't know what he looks like,

563
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,607
they only know he's meeting
the widow at midnight.

564
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:33,871
If you go through with this,

565
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,277
they're gonna believe you're lark
and they're gonna kill you.

566
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,666
How do you know all this?

567
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,086
I can't tell you that.

568
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,719
You should've stayed out of the game.

569
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,640
You should've come with me.

570
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:01,565
Widow: This charity was started
in honor of my mother.

571
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,076
Those of you who knew her
understood her strength,

572
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,075
her tenacity, her resourcefulness.

573
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,166
(People laughing)

574
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,992
But there was another side to her,

575
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,078
a side most people never saw.

576
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,880
It is that part of her spirit
that has brought us

577
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,753
all together tonight.

578
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,420
Max was something of a paradox.

579
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,182
She had a fascination for paradoxes,

580
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,770
a fascination she passed on to me.

581
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:37,775
Max had no illusions about
the world we live in today.

582
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,693
But she had dreams
of a very different future.

583
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,201
One in which her unique talents
were no longer required.

584
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,529
All she earned from the way the world is

585
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,621
went ultimately to making it
what it could someday be.

586
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,620
That future isn't here yet.

587
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:02,585
Tonight, your contributions
have brought it just a little closer.

588
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,089
(Applause)

589
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,089
Thank you all for coming.

590
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,765
Enjoy the party.

591
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,518
(Jazz music playing)

592
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,365
You can't possibly be John lark.

593
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,544
I'm not, actually.

594
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,043
It's an alias.

595
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,797
I suppose it's better than John Doe.

596
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,199
Is there another name you prefer?

597
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,963
Is there somewhere
we could talk privately?

598
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,299
In fact I like "lark."
It does have a certain ring.

599
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,496
We don't have a lot of time.

600
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,056
'Cause I'll be honest.

601
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,479
A man of your reputation,
I was expecting someone

602
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,143
uglier.

603
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,234
(Gasps)

604
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,651
Don't let looks deceive.
I'm as ugly as they come.

605
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,483
And I'll be honest with you.
Your life is in danger.

606
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,323
Don't you touch her.

607
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,401
Relax. It's my brother.

608
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,278
You're being rude to our guest, zola.

609
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,163
It's time to go.

610
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,662
Don't turn this into a scene.

611
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,377
You don't want to be with this one.

612
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,717
- You were saying?
- Your life is in danger.

613
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,510
And who would want to kill me?

614
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,057
The Americans, for starters.

615
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,718
If that were true, I would know it.

616
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,478
You think you're the only one
with spies in the government?

617
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,899
There are people here
who don't want this meeting to happen.

618
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,567
Don't believe me?

619
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,569
Look around.

620
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,199
I know what you're thinking.

621
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,667
Maybe they're not here for you.

622
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,791
Maybe they're just here for me.

623
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,293
Are you willing to take that chance?

624
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,126
You have something I want.

625
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,678
Right now, that makes me
the only person you can trust

626
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,630
to get you out of here alive.

627
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,308
Or would you rather leave that
to your brother?

628
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:23,141
I think I'd like
to go home now, Mr. lark.

629
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,326
(Knife unsheathes)

630
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:32,821
(Grunting)

631
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:33,954
(Man groans)

632
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,583
- (Both grunting)
- (People exclaiming)

633
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:41,879
(People gasp)

634
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,376
(Panicked chatter)

635
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,771
- (Grunting)
(Woman yelps)

636
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,366
- (Gunshot)
(People screaming)

637
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,552
(Guns cocking)

638
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,912
The French government took receipt
of the asset at noon today.

639
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,365
Delivery will be via air
to the finance ministry

640
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,659
at 8:00 A.M. tomorrow morning.

641
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,167
An armored motorcade
under heavy police escort

642
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,166
will transport him via this route.

643
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,507
We'll create a diversion
at this intersection, here.

644
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:56,553
The motorcade will automatically take
the preplanned alternate route here,

645
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,214
where we'll extract the asset.

646
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,307
Extract the asset?

647
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,737
The asset.

648
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,693
We paid a great deal of money
for this information.

649
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,369
They gave us everything
but this man's name.

650
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,994
You don't happen to know
who he is, do you?

651
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,867
His name is Solomon Lane.

652
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,624
British special agent turned anarchist.

653
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,668
He used rogue covert operatives

654
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,046
to create a terror network
called the syndicate.

655
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,963
Sabotage, assassination, mass murder.

656
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,299
As ugly as they come.

657
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:46,307
Walker: He was captured
by American agents two years ago.

658
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,605
Since then, he's been in
a never-ending interrogation,

659
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,899
passed around from
one government to another

660
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,398
to answer for his crimes.

661
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,732
You seem displeased, lark.

662
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,407
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

663
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,747
I came to Paris for plutonium.

664
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,576
Well, there must be a misunderstanding.

665
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,581
I'm just a broker.

666
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,754
I connect a buyer and a seller.

667
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:18,168
My seller's not interested in cash,
so if you want the plutonium...

668
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,503
Extract Lane

669
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,846
and make a trade.

670
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,511
Widow: That's right.

671
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,272
How do I know
the seller has what I want?

672
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,793
Widow: A down payment in good faith.

673
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,464
A courier will deliver
two more within 48 hours

674
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,292
in exchange for him.

675
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,728
All right.

676
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,687
What happens after the diversion?

677
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,060
(Inaudible)

678
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,694
Kill everyone?

679
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,401
That's your plan?

680
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,744
There will be no withesses.

681
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,743
What's my guarantee that Lane
walks out of this thing alive?

682
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,286
He's in an armored box.

683
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,998
We'll pull him out when it's safe.

684
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,004
You want your plutonium,

685
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,248
this is the price.

686
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,714
Or do you draw the line at killing cops?

687
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,013
That's John lark you're talking to.

688
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,349
I murder women and children
with smallpox.

689
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,390
I have no line.

690
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,729
Right.

691
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,108
Sleep well, everyone. Busy day tomorrow.

692
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,213
Sloane: You have got to be kidding me.

693
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,049
If you want Lane out of prison,
this is how it gets done.

694
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,223
I wanted lark to break him out,
not Ethan hunt.

695
00:46:56,314 --> 00:47:00,148
I wanted lark at the exchange,
not Ethan hunt.

696
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,351
I wanted lark to lead us
to the plutonium

697
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,232
and the apostles.

698
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,843
Walker: You may still get your chance.

699
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,760
Have you forgotten about
the corpse we pulled

700
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,220
out of the men's room
at the grand palais?

701
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,030
I'm guessing that wasn't lark.

702
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,531
More likely one of lark's recruits.

703
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,829
Not according to our intelligence.

704
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,119
Intelligence gathered by whom?

705
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:21,752
Hunt.

706
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,048
You've long held suspicions that lark
was an American agent.

707
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,750
Someone who knew our every move.

708
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,052
Someone who could
come and go like a ghost.

709
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,090
You're suggesting hunt is John lark.

710
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:39,304
You're reaching, Walker.
Trying to save your ass.

711
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,138
It won't work.

712
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:44,559
Think about it.
Would a man as careful as lark

713
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,689
really stick his neck out like that?

714
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,772
For a face-to-face with the white widow?

715
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,573
- He'd send a proxy.
- A decoy.

716
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,442
And if he was really smart,

717
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,153
he'd have his lady friend
kill that decoy

718
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,159
in front of a reliable witness.

719
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,250
Me.

720
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,706
The dragnet is closing in
on his terrorist alter ego.

721
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,709
So he pays a man
to play the part of lark

722
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,960
and has him killed.

723
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:10,214
And under the guise
of serving his country...

724
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,886
Assumes his own secret identity.

725
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,550
Free to operate at will

726
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,402
with the full support
of the U.S. government.

727
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,641
Why?

728
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,976
Why would hunt turn?

729
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,306
Why did Lane do it?
Why did any of his apostles?

730
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,810
They were believers in a cause.

731
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,395
And when that cause
turned out to be a lie,

732
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,277
they turned
against their masters.

733
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:35,576
How many times has hunt's
government betrayed him,

734
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,403
disavowed him, cast him aside?

735
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:40,494
And how long before
a man like that

736
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,366
has had enough?

737
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,665
That 1s a serious accusation.

738
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,831
Can you prove it?

739
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,382
This is the phone
we pulled off the dead body

740
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,838
at the grand palais.

741
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,642
I'm guessing
it has all the proof you need.

742
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,030
(Gun cocks)

743
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,456
(Beeps)

744
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,508
(Helicopter approaching)

745
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10,728
Walker: Is it true Lane gassed
a village of 2,000 people?

746
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,237
Yes.

747
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,778
Is it true he brought down
an entire passenger plane

748
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:17,865
just to kill one man?

749
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,611
Yes.

750
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,740
- Is it true that he...
- Hey, Walker.

751
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,910
Whatever you heard,
if it makes your skin crawl,

752
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,582
it's probably true.

753
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,082
Holy shit.

754
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,002
You're the guy
that caught him, aren't you?

755
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:42,929
How long do you think

756
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,507
he's gonna keep that to himself?

757
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,813
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

758
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,734
(Speaks French)

759
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,198
(Engine starts)

(Soldiers shouting indistinctly)

764
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,372
(In English) What the hell is he doing?

765
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,761
- (Tires screech)
(All grunt)

766

(Engine revving)

773

- (Engine stalling)
(Officers shouting)

774
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,680
Hunt? Where are you?

775
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,507
Don't wait for me!

776
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:40,185
- What is it? What's wrong?
- (Engine starts)

777
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,682
I'll meet you at the garage.

778
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:48,777
(Siren blares)

779
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,989
Benji, do you copy?

780
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,820
We copy. Go.

781
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:58,029
Change of plan. I'm blown.
Need extraction.

782
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,704
We're on our way.

783
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:14,168

Stop.

Stay where you are.

802
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:44,742

Finish her.

818
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:40,923
(Gunshot)

819
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,140
(Groaning)

820
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:54,343
(Speaking French)

821
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,018
You'll be all right.

822
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,019
(Man speaks French on radio)

823
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,356
(Speaking French)

824
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,479
Benji: (In English) We got to go.

825
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,653
(Speaking French)

826
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,572
I'm so sorry.

827
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,576
Benji: Come on.

828
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,417
(Engine starts)

829
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,347
(Sirens wailing)

830
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,645
The name's Walker, by the way.

831
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,065
Was the little car your idea?

832
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,455
- (Lane groans)
- Benji: Jesus Christ!

833
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,066
- What the hell was that?
- (Silenced gunshot)

834
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,330
(Engine revving)

835
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:09,634
(Tires screeching)

836
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,262
- Everybody out.
- Benji: Go, go, go!

837
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:49,833
(Horns honking)

838
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:02,981
(Gunshot)

839
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,436
(Horn blaring)

840
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,590
- (Horn honking)
(Grunts)

841
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:43,929
(Tires screeching)

842
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,650
- (Brakes screech)
(Horn honks)

843
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:25,804
(Brakes screeching)

844
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,310
(Church bell tolling)

845
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,699
(Shifting gears)

846
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:48,914
(Sighs)

847
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:50,795
That was Ilsa.

848
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:52,839
Shut up.

849
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,924
Very interesting.

850
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,721
It's good to see you again, Ethan.

851
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,063
(Groans)

852
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,235
- (Panting)
- (Sirens wailing)

853
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:19,076
(Groans)

854
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,387
Oh, look who's still alive.

855
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,971
There's a microwave tracker in his neck.

856
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,677
Got it. You know what to do.

857
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,979
Let me just assure you, this won't hurt

858
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,431
enough.

859
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:56,107
- Ninety seconds.
- (Timer ticking)

860
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,117
You and your apostles think
we're gonna trade you

861
01:07:58,157 --> 01:07:59,863
for the missing plutonium.

862
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:02,567
I'm here to tell you
that's never gonna happen.

863
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:06,029
"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it."

864
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,872
I wonder, Ethan,

865
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,450
did you ever choose not to?

866
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,793
Did you ever stop and ask yourself

867
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,713
who it was giving you the orders or why?

868
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,249
While every day the master you serve

869
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,505
moves one step closer
to ending the world.

870
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:23,088
Strange accusation
coming from a terrorist.

871
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,297
Sixty seconds.

872
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:26,428
Terrorists are schoolboys
desperate for attention,

873
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:30,228
hoping to shape
public opinion through fear.

874
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:33,557
I don't care in the least
what people think or feel.

875
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:36,351
In my experience,
they don't do either for very long.

876
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,591
Benji: Oh, and I suppose that
justifies bombing factories

877
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,151
or bringing down civilian aircraft.

878
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,774
Or strapping me
into an explosive vest!

879
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:45,952
Consider it unfinished business,
my funny little friend.

880
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:47,950
- Luther?
Almost there.

881
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,157
Lane: You see the end
as clearly as I do, Ethan.

882
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,993
Governments the world over
are descending into madness.

883
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:57,206
The syndicate was created
to tear them down, brick by brick.

884
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,291
The syndicate was
a pack of murdering cowards.

885
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:03,048
The syndicate
was civilization's last hope!

886
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,552
A chance to smash the old world order.

887
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,925
That hope is gone now
because of you

888
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:11,640
and your pathetic morality.

889
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,562
(Helicopter approaching)

890
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,477
You should have killed me, Ethan.

891
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:20,061
The end you've always feared

892
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,029
is coming.

893
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:23,655
(Exhaling sharply)

894
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:26,113
It's coming!

895
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,867
And the blood will be on your hands.

896
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:34,792
The fallout

897
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:38,538
of all your good intentions.

898
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,498
(Sirens wailing in distance)

899
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:44,468
(Timer stops)

900
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,762
- Time.
- Got it.

901
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,056
(Device beeping)

902
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:59,233
(Sirens wailing overhead)

903
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,946
(Helicopter passing overhead)

904
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:08,951
(Sirens fade)

905
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:12,705
Get him up.

906
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:16,868
You're mine now.

907
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,171
Widow: You're just
full of surprises, lark.

908
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,598
Ethan: Your brother's plan
was bad from the word go.

909
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,846
You'd have lost all your men

910
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,777
and Lane would've been killed
in the crossfire.

911
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,059
I had to improvise.

912
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:40,190
Widow: Well, why not say that
in the first place?

913
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:42,064
Ethan: Because I don't
trust your people.

914
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:44,441
Especially not your brother.

915
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:51,027
Family. What can you do?

916
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,991
So, where's Lane?

917
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,326
Certainly not at the bottom
of the seine.

918
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,161
I have him. He's safe.

919
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,671
Where do I meet the courier?

920
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:05,633
Let's talk about the woman.

921
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,132
Woman?

922
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,675
She was with you at the palais.

923
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,132
Zola saw her again today.

924
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:13,967
She tried to kill Lane.

925
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,143
She had the chance to kill you,
but she didn't.

926
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:17,564
Why?

927
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,150
We have a past.

928
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:25,820
It's complicated.

929
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,282
Well, I'll make it
more complicated for you.

930
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,778
My price just went up.

931
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:35,033
Someone killed four of my men today.

932
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,705
I'm assuming it was her.

933
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,960
I want her, lark.

934
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,542
And you're gonna bring her to me.

935
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,419
Otherwise, you don't meet the courier

936
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:52,881
and the plutonium goes
to the highest bidder.

937
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:56,600
I'd hate for her
to come between us.

938
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,148
She's yours.

939
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,484
At the meeting. Not before.

940
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:19,290
Go to London.

941
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,209
Instructions will follow.

942
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:06,598
I knew if I followed her,
you'd show up eventually.

943
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,232
Are you okay?

944
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:11,860
Lisa, I never wanted to hurt you.

945
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,030
I know you have your reasons.

946
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,735
I know.

947
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,533
You need to walk away.

948
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:22,955
I can't do that.

949
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:27,206
You weren't at the palais to kill lark.

950
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,411
No.

951
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:31,793
You were there to protect him.

952
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,503
Yes.

953
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,380
And you killed him to protect me.

954
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:40,139
You wanted lark to break Lane out.

955
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:45,011
No. You needed him to break Lane out.

956
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,931
Because you have to kill Lane.

957
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,274
Who's making you do this?

958
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,486
Mig.

959
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:58,118
Why?

960
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,200
After we captured him in London,

961
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:03,575
they tried to bring Lane home
through diplomatic channels.

962
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:06,328
But too many countries
want their pound of flesh.

963
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,330
A man like that, what he's seen,

964
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:09,982
what he knows
about British intelligence,

965
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:13,373
they can't have him talking
to a foreign government ever.

966
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:15,128
That's not what I'm asking.

967
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,426
Why did they send you?

968
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,926
This is how I prove my loyalty.

969
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,132
This is how I come home.

970
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,013
But you were out.

971
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:26,514
You were free.

972
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:28,345
We are never free.

973
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,983
I spent two years undercover with Lane.

974
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,776
To them, I'm as much
of a threat as he is.

975
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,323
I kill him, or I never stop running.

976
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,032
Now tell me where he is.

977
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,534
I can't help you.

978
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:53,336
I will get to him one way or another.

979
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,916
Please don't make me go through you.

980
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:35,882
(Gasps)

981
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:46,302
(Cell phone ringing)

982
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:54,098
Yes.

983
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:55,979
Widow: (On phone)
Are you here in London?

984
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,355
Ethan: I am.

985
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,437
Are you ready to meet the courier?

986
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,277
Yes. Where do I go?

987
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,324
Where would you like to meet?

988
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,491
Mr. secretary.

989
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,742
I prayed to god that it wasn't true.

990
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,410
Benji: Well, in his defense, sir,

991
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:49,953
if Ethan hadn't intervened,

992
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,434
a great many people
would have been killed.

993
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,699
Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that
the good people of Paris

994
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:56,957
and the nation of France as a whole
will take that into account.

995
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,751
So what the hell happened?

996
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,547
- (Device hisses)
(Exhales)

997
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,228
(Device beeping)

998
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,485
At which point, we were
told to come to London

999
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:23,646
and await further instructions.

1000
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:25,239
And what happens now?

1001
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,115
Now,

1002
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:29,743
we meet the widow in 20 minutes.

1003
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,320
She'll take us to a courier

1004
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:34,498
who'll hand over our missing plutonium
in exchange for Solomon Lane.

1005
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,166
Or, in our scenario,

1006
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:38,619
Benji.

1007
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:40,163
Jesus.

1008
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:41,584
I'm sorry, what?

1009
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:43,278
Ethan: Luther and I are gonna
take you to the courier.

1010
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:44,982
Walker stays here
and guards the real Lane.

1011
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:46,134
Absolutely not.

1012
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,574
Wait, wait.
Why do I have to be Lane?

1013
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:48,598
Benji.

1014
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:51,515
Our mission, my mission,
is to recover that plutonium,

1015
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,684
and I will do so at any cost.

1016
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,432
Even if I have to trade Lane.

1017
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:56,932
The real Lane.

1018
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:59,060
And I will never let him go.

1019
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,143
When the apostles realize
that you're playing games,

1020
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,524
you'll lose the plutonium. Again.

1021
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:06,613
You let us worry about the apostles.

1022
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,112
As it stands, we have a bigger problem.

1023
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:10,659
A bigger problem?

1024
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,903
- Ilsa.
- Benji: Lisa?

1025
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,534
Our Lisa? Ilsa faust Lisa?

1026
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:15,810
How is she mixed up in all of this?

1027
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:18,166
She's been ordered
to kill Lane. Direct from MI6.

1028
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,667
Look, wait. So that was her
in Paris? On the bike.

1029
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:22,792
Yeah.

1030
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,089
Ethan, she tried to kill us!

1031
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,445
- Ethan: No, not us. Not us.
Yeah.

1032
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,710
Lane. She tried to kill Lane.
She has no choice.

1033
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:28,840
And she will kill me!

1034
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,116
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1035
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,220
Ethan, how exactly are you
not gonna let that happen?

1036
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,934
- I'm working on it.
- Oh, he's working on it.

1037
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,457
Ethan: Right now,
we don't have a lot of time.

1038
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,000
We have to get ready for this meeting.

1039
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,480
Hunley: The meeting is a trap.

1040
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:43,776
The white widow is working with the CIA.

1041
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,398
She has been since the beginning.

1042
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:49,319
Bargaining for immunity
is her stock-in-trade.

1043
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,947
Capturing the plutonium,
and the apostles, and John lark

1044
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,494
buys her a lot of goodwill
with the Americans.

1045
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,448
But if Sloane knew the meeting was
a trap, why didn't she just tell us?

1046
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,646
Hunley: Because, in her mind,
anybody could be John lark,

1047
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,410
including one of us.

1048
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,667
And now her suspicions are confirmed.

1049
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:08,587
According to that dossier,

1050
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:11,136
a trail of electronic evidence
connects hunt

1051
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:14,385
to the theft of smallpox from the CDC.

1052
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,842
It also links him
to a lengthy correspondence

1053
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,973
ending with the recruitment
of Dr. delbruuk.

1054
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,396
And, of course,
hunt handed over the plutonium

1055
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,314
to the apostles himself.

1056
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:25,358
Now, those facts, coupled with

1057
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:28,153
a long and incriminating
history of rogue behavior,

1058
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,776
corroborate a CIA narrative

1059
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,658
that hunt has snapped.

1060
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:36,279
And that his search for lark
is nothing but a cover

1061
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,204
to hide the fact that lark...

1062
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:40,293
1s me.

1063
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,753
Hunley: I've got to hand it
to you, Ethan.

1064
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,172
Normally, when people refer to you
as your own worst enemy,

1065
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,840
it's just a figure of speech.

1066
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:56,507
I'm afraid Sloane's got
some questions for her as well.

1067
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:59,681
The widow offered her up
at no extra charge.

1068
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,225
And where did Sloane
get this information?

1069
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,765
Hunley: She didn't say.

1070
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:07,939
She did, however, Grant me
the opportunity to bring you in,

1071
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,191
on the condition that
I terminate this mission

1072
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,648
and hand over
Solomon Lane personally.

1073
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,858
- Sir, you can't do that.
- Hunley: Hunt.

1074
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,490
I know Lane. And he has
no intention of going back.

1075
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:18,946
That's why we're taking him back.

1076
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:22,158
Which means that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

1077
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:23,438
- Ethan...
- Ethan: Sir, what do you

1078
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:24,622
think this 1s? A coincidence?

1079
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:25,815
That someone just happened upon this?

1080
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,455
Lane had it sent to her.
He knew how she would react.

1081
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,415
Just like he knew
the widow would turn us in.

1082
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:31,511
Don't you see?

1083
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:33,335
This, sir...

1084
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,428
This is the trap.

1085
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,381
- We are being directed.
- Hunt!

1086
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:40,058
There are still two plutonium cores
in the wind!

1087
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,431
And you lost them!

1088
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:46,890
In fairness, sir, we all lost them.

1089
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:50,106
Respectfully, sir, you weren't there.

1090
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:52,688
So making excuses for him
is your full-time job now?

1091
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:57,193
Good god, Ethan, don't make this
any harder than it already is.

1092
01:21:57,621 --> 01:22:00,454
I can no longer protect you,
don't you understand that?

1093
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:03,283
This is as close as
you're ever gonna get to that plutonium.

1094
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,208
Sir, you don't actually believe this.

1095
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:07,627
I believe I've been given
a choice to protect you

1096
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:09,921
or the imf, which is why
I'm bringing you in.

1097
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:12,758
And if I refuse?

1098
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:15,006
What do you think he's here for?

1099
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,337
You think he's some observer?

1100
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:17,888
He's an assassin!

1101
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:20,512
Erika Sloane's number-one plumber.

1102
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:23,594
You go rogue, he's authorized
to hunt you down

1103
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:25,437
and kill you.

1104
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:31,273
It's the job.
No hard feelings.

1105
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:33,236
Accept it, Ethan.

1106
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,484
You've lost this one.
What's done is done.

1107
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,409
No, sir. No.

1108
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,617
Hunley: I am not asking you.
I am giving you a direct order.

1109
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:45,324
This mission is terminated.

1110
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:47,163
Now!

1111
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:51,372
Stickell, he's your friend.

1112
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:52,819
Would you please talk
some sense into...

1113
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:53,923
- (Device hisses)
(Groans)

1114
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:58,511
I'm sorry, sir,
but you left me no choice.

1115
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,591
There's 15 minutes
before we meet the widow.

1116
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:04,330
You want the plutonium,
we're the only ones

1117
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,310
who can get it for you. You in or out?

1118
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:09,275
In.

1119
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:11,691
- What are you doing?
- Benji needs to get ready.

1120
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:13,643
- No, Ethan...
- There's no time, Luther.

1121
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,400
I need you to trust me.

1122
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:23,574
(Device beeping)

1123
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:30,793
(Exhales)

1124
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:33,713
You all right?

1125
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:35,382
Yeah, I just

1126
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:37,886
(in Lane's voice)
Got a bad feeling about this one.

1127
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:00,326
(Gate opens)

1128
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,425
- If you don't hear from us...
- (Cocks gun)

1129
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,372
I'll do it my way.

1130
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,127
Ethan: Don't take your eyes off him.

1131
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:48,416
(Gasps)

1132
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:51,579
Enough games.
I'm taking you out of here.

1133
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,001
Where's hunt?

1134
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:55,666
He's gone to the meeting,
with a copy of you.

1135
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:56,872
Calm down.

1136
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:58,628
Call the apostles. Warn them.

1137
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,505
I have no way of contacting them.

1138
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:02,211
For their safety and mine.

1139
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:03,921
What I do have
is an extraction team with

1140
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,257
satellite overwatch
and a prearranged rendezvous.

1141
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:07,829
They'll know as soon as
we leave the building.

1142
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:10,185
No, I'm staying here.

1143
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,137
I haven't finished with hunt yet.

1144
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:19,687
Why did you have to make this
so fucking complicated?

1145
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,071
I don't understand what you mean.

1146
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,865
The deal was simple.

1147
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:27,160
I help you frame hunt,
you give me the plutonium.

1148
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:29,078
You're wasting time.

1149
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:32,203
"There cannot be peace without
first a great suffering.

1150
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,290
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace."

1151
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:36,746
When I wrote those words,

1152
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:41,083
I wasn't referring to your peace
or hunt's suffering.

1153
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:43,294
The old world order
needs dismantling,

1154
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:45,344
and we have the tools
to dismantle it.

1155
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:47,013
All you seem to care about

1156
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,762
is that hunt lives to take the blame.

1157
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:51,514
That's not anarchy.

1158
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:53,141
That's revenge.

1159
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:54,767
Yes, it is.

1160
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,939
And when I have what I want,

1161
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,231
the apostles will give you
the plutonium.

1162
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:05,823
Hunt's the only friend you've got.

1163
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:06,946
You're only alive today

1164
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:09,028
because he didn't have
the guts to kill you.

1165
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:11,829
Sloane was right.
The imf is Halloween.

1166
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:14,158
Nothing but grown men wearing...

1167
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:22,882
What? (Clears throat)

1168
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,380
(Panting)

1169
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,429
It's just the job.
No hard feelings.

1170
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,101
(Gun cocks)

1171
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:37,556
I've ruined your day, haven't I?

1172
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:40,983
- (Gun clicking) _oh!

1173
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,858
And you were doing so well
up until then.

1174
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:46,113
Now, I think this one's loaded.

1175
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:48,316
You want to find out?

1176
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:50,573
(Grunts)

1177
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:33,116
- So, how'd I do?
- I never had a doubt.

1178
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,332
I'm beginning to see why
you guys enjoy this so much.

1179
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,159
Hats off, Mr. secretary.

1180
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,870
- The man's a natural.
- Welcome to the team, sir.

1181
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,877
You're making a mistake.

1182
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:49,302
No, the mistake was mine
when I saved your life over Paris.

1183
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:51,971
This proves nothing.
I'm playing a role,

1184
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:54,140
just like you are, trying to
recover that plutonium.

1185
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:56,764
That doesn't explain why
you gave Sloane the dossier

1186
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,095
and tried to frame hunt.

1187
01:27:58,190 --> 01:27:59,726
He makes a good point,

1188
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:01,066
lark.

1189
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:03,729
He's paranoid. Delusional.

1190
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,731
Just like the dossier says.

1191
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:07,528
So where did Sloane
get the dossier from?

1192
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,607
I have no idea.

1193
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,066
Sloane: (On phone) / do.

1194
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,536
Did you get all that, Erika?

1195
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:16,989
I did.

1196
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:19,574
I don't appreciate being used, Walker.

1197
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,412
Oops. Bad boy.

1198
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,027
Hunley: Where would you
like him delivered?

1199
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,962
I'll come to you.

1200
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:32,463
Officer: Nobody move! Nobody move!

1201
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,093
Weapons down! Drop 'em!

1202
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:36,925
Hands in the air!
Weapons down!

1203
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:39,101
Drop it! Drop it!

1204
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:40,728
Weapons down! Right now! You!

1205
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:43,353
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.

1206
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:45,392
I thought we had a deal.

1207
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:48,319
We did. And now we don't.

1208
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:51,990
There is too much at stake here
for me to take any chances.

1209
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:54,947
I'm bringing you all in,
along with Walker.

1210
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:56,611
The plutonium is still out there!

1211
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,494
And I don't trust a living soul
in that room to get it.

1212
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:02,501
We'll sort out who's who in Washington.

1213
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:04,877
- Erikal
- sir?

1214
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,464
It's all right.
Let's just do what she says.

1215
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,251
The only real threats are in this room,
and we have them.

1216
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:15,930
Do you?

1217
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:18,015
Go.

1218
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:25,901
(Lane grunts)

1219
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:39,245
Where the hell 1s Lane?

1220
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:55,382
(Both grunting)

1221
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:00,391
- (Stabs)
(Groaning)

1222
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:10,905
Luther: Ethan! Ethan!

1223
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:37,462
First team is down.
Send backup.

1224
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:41,557
- (Pants and groans)
- Sir!

1225
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:45,015
Oh, no, no, no.
Man down! Man down!

1226
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:48,891
Somebody help!

1227
01:30:57,911 --> 01:30:59,071
Sir.

1228
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:00,909
(Gunfire continues)

1229
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:06,074
Ethan, I tagged Walker,
but he's on the run.

1230
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:07,579
You got to get him.

1231
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:13,585
Go.

1232
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:16,717
I'm sorry, sir.

1233
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:19,838
(Weakly) Go.

1234
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:22,094
(Gunfire continues)

1235
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:31,770
Ethan?

1236
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,074
Wait!

1237
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:40,275
Get that son of a bitch.

1238
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:48,252
(Silenced gunshot)

1239
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:10,938
- Come on, come on, come on.
- (Beeping)

1240
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:12,307
Yes! I got him.

1241
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:18,855
(Officers shouting indistinctly)

1242
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,527
(Choral music playing)

1243
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:24,781
I'm sorry.

1244
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,826
Talk to me, Benji. Where's Walker?

1245
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:30,021
Benji. He's about a quarter mile west
if you turn right.

1246
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:31,626
To my right?

1247
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:35,872
I can't do that.

1248
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:37,465
Why not?

1249
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:39,626
Because I'm being followed.

1250
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:41,802
What do you mean? By who?

1251
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:43,547
How do I know?
CIA, apostles...

1252
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:44,972
What difference does it make?

1253
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:48,810
(Stammering) Okay, okay, just get
out of there and then go right.

1254
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:57,940
I am terribly sorry.

1255
01:32:58,281 --> 01:32:59,612
Excuse me.

1256
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:15,670
(Beeping)

1257
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:18,169
Why is he running in circles?

1258
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:21,129
(Panting)

1259
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:47,801
Okay, you need to cross the street
on your left as soon as you can.

1260
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:54,792
Ethan, did you copy?

1261
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,165
- Left, go left, now!
- I'm working on it.

1262
01:34:08,518 --> 01:34:10,679
Now go across the street
right in front of you.

1263
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:20,853
Ethan, he's getting away from you!
You're gonna have to go faster.

1264
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:38,248
(Grunting)

1265
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,043
(Telephone ringing)

1266
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:46,882
(Panting)

1267
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:54,260
You're gaining on him!
Go straight.

1268
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:58,394
Straight? Keep going straight?

1269
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:00,726
Go straight, go straight,
straight, straight.

1270
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,690
Okay, now turn right.

1271
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:04,948
Right?

1272
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,530
Now?

1273
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,316
- Yes, right!
- Are you sure?

1274
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:09,654
Yes, I'm...

1275
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:11,786
No, it's left! Turn left!

1276
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:13,738
Sorry, I had the screen-lock on.

1277
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:16,033
(Pants)

1278
01:35:17,587 --> 01:35:18,918
Left.

1279
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:23,623
Thank you.

1280
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:33,258
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm jumping out a window!

1281
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:35,139
What do you mean,
you're jumping out of a...

1282
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:39,059
Oh, sorry. I had it in 2d.

1283
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:40,769
Good luck.

1284
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:50,696
(Grunts)

1285
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,922
At the end of the bridge,
turn left. You've almost got him.

1286
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:23,103
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, Ethan, get him!

1287
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,274
You're right on top of him!

1288
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:40,562
That's it, he's right in front of you!

1289
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:41,701
Get him! Get him! Get him!

1290
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:06,608
(Ethan panting)

1291
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:10,490
(Gun cocks)

1292
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:13,241
(Grunting)

1293
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:21,366
You can't do it, can you?
Not until you get your plutonium.

1294
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:25,537
No. He still has plans for you.

1295
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:29,715
You're gonna turn yourself in
and admit you're John lark,

1296
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:33,136
then watch the old world implode
from your dark little cell.

1297
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:34,758
And if I don't?

1298
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:41,643
(Gasps)

1299
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,356
I'm her guardian angel, hunt.

1300
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:53,902
If I see you again, she dies.

1301
01:37:53,993 --> 01:37:56,609
If you try to warn her, she dies.

1302
01:37:56,996 --> 01:37:58,281
Know when you're beat.

1303
01:38:04,337 --> 01:38:05,543
(Elevator bell dings)

1304
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:11,920
(Grunting)

1305
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:11,459
Luther: These are the designs
we recovered

1306
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:13,690
from Dr. delbruuk's lab in Berlin.

1307
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:15,863
Benji: That's a five-megaton
nuclear device.

1308
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:17,636
That's greater than
all the explosive energy

1309
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:18,695
released in world war il.

1310
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:22,449
To disarm it, normally
we'd cut the fuse wire here.

1311
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:23,996
What, "normally"?

1312
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:26,916
Walker and Lane
have two plutonium cores,

1313
01:39:27,003 --> 01:39:28,368
meaning two bombs.

1314
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:30,999
Yeah. And they're both linked
by a microwave fail-safe

1315
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:32,943
which is accurate to
within one-tenth of a second.

1316
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:37,131
Any attempt to defuse one bomb
automatically triggers the other.

1317
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:40,263
Meaning once armed,
the bombs cannot be disarmed.

1318
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:43,011
Benji: The countdown is
started by a remote detonator,

1319
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:45,093
which 1s also a fail-safe.

1320
01:39:45,188 --> 01:39:47,474
Meaning once the countdown starts,

1321
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:49,480
it can't be stopped.

1322
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:53,650
So the solution to this is?

1323
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:57,146
We're working on it.

1324
01:39:58,743 --> 01:39:59,743
So,

1325
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:02,823
technically, this is a suicide mission.

1326
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:14,925
What is it?

1327
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,842
Have a seat. Please.

1328
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:23,840
In all the years
that I've known Ethan,

1329
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:26,847
he's only been serious
about two women.

1330
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:29,679
One was his wife.

1331
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:31,772
He's married?

1332
01:40:31,984 --> 01:40:33,975
No, he was.

1333
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:36,102
Was? What happened to her?

1334
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:37,812
Well, she was taken

1335
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:40,861
by some people
who wanted to get to Ethan.

1336
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,742
It's okay,
he got her back in one piece.

1337
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:45,908
Then he quit the game.

1338
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:49,077
They were happy for a while.

1339
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:52,502
But every time something bad
happened in the world,

1340
01:40:52,672 --> 01:40:55,084
Ethan would think,
"I should've been there."

1341
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:57,923
And she would wonder,
"who's watching the world

1342
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:00,001
"while Ethan's watching me?"

1343
01:41:00,429 --> 01:41:03,592
Deep down, they both knew
that someday, somehow,

1344
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:06,758
something truly terrible
was going to happen

1345
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:10,436
all because they were together.

1346
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:12,604
So...

1347
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:17,728
- Where is she now?
- She's a ghost.

1348
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:19,278
Good at it, too.

1349
01:41:19,532 --> 01:41:21,193
Taught her myself.

1350
01:41:21,534 --> 01:41:23,900
Every now and then,
she sends up a signal

1351
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:25,155
to let Ethan know she's safe.

1352
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:27,824
And that keeps him going.

1353
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:30,656
Why are you telling me this?

1354
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:33,618
Hmm.

1355
01:41:34,589 --> 01:41:38,173
We're in this mess because
Ethan wouldn't let me die.

1356
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:42,126
He's a good man.

1357
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:46,472
And he cares about you
more than he can admit.

1358
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:51,265
That's one more worry
than he can handle right now.

1359
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:55,940
If you care about him,

1360
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,017
you should walk away.

1361
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:02,897
Luther...

1362
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:04,482
Ethan: Is everything all right?

1363
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:12,577
(Sighs softly)

1364
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:18,462
I'm coming with you.

1365
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:28,548
I know.

1366
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:34,053
So how do we find him?

1367
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:37,436
Microwave transponder.

1368
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:40,317
Traceable via satellite
anywhere in the world.

1369
01:42:40,655 --> 01:42:42,382
Lane had one of these
in the back of his neck.

1370
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:43,406
(Rapid beeping)

1371
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:44,606
We removed it in Paris.

1372
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:47,028
At the same time,
we put our own transponder in.

1373
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:48,283
Got it.

1374
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:52,488
Luther: 36-hour delayed activation,

1375
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:55,079
in case Lane's apostles scan him.

1376
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:57,827
So you planned on letting him go.

1377
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:00,087
Not this way, but yes.

1378
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:01,877
He's gonna lead us to the plutonium.

1379
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:03,757
How can you be sure?

1380
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:06,010
His plan to put me in prison
went to hell.

1381
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:09,342
Now he's gonna want me there
for the end.

1382
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:11,431
So when does this transponder activate?

1383
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:13,121
Benji: I got him. I got him,
I got him, I got him!

1384
01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:15,227
He's traveling east
over Europe at 500 knots.

1385
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:16,398
Luther: He's airborne.

1386
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:17,680
Shall we inform the CIA?

1387
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:19,685
The CIA's been infiltrated.

1388
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:22,268
I don't trust anybody
outside of this room.

1389
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,441
We're gonna have to go it alone.

1390
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:28,326
So where do we go?

1391
01:43:48,723 --> 01:43:50,054
Ethan: How we doing, Benji?

1392
01:43:50,516 --> 01:43:53,178
If there's a way to defuse these bombs,
I can't find it.

1393
01:43:53,352 --> 01:43:55,593
You'll figure it out.
I know you will.

1394
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,060
(Steady beeping)

1395
01:43:57,189 --> 01:43:59,521
Luther: Damn. Ethan, we lost the signal.

1396
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,515
Lane must've found our transmitter.

1397
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:05,235
- What's his last position?
Luther: About 30 miles northeast.

1398
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:07,480
Then that's where he wants us to go.

1399
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:09,489
- What's there?
- The nubra river valley.

1400
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,366
There's only a medical camp there.

1401
01:44:11,454 --> 01:44:13,820
Humanitarian aid overseas.

1402
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:16,907
Why would Lane target a medical camp?

1403
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:18,543
Smallpox.

1404
01:44:19,211 --> 01:44:20,211
What?

1405
01:44:20,296 --> 01:44:23,538
Smallpox. The apostles triggered
a smallpox outbreak in kashmir.

1406
01:44:24,049 --> 01:44:26,665
Lane must've wanted that camp there
for a reason.

1407
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:28,258
But what?

1408
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:30,886
- Oh, my god.
“what is it?

1409
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:34,807
The nubra river is at the base
of the siachen glacier.

1410
01:44:35,144 --> 01:44:36,704
So a nuclear blast there
would irradiate

1411
01:44:36,729 --> 01:44:39,812
the largest natural irrigation system
in the world.

1412
01:44:40,483 --> 01:44:44,146
Fresh water from the border of
China to India and Pakistan.

1413
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:48,271
They're gonna starve one-third
of the world's population.

1414
01:44:48,449 --> 01:44:49,655
"The greater the suffering..."

1415
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:51,900
"The greater the peace."

1416
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:55,286
I still don't understand
why Lane wants a medical camp there.

1417
01:44:55,456 --> 01:44:56,616
Ethan: It doesn't matter.

1418
01:44:56,791 --> 01:44:59,373
All that matters now is we find a way
to defuse those bombs.

1419
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,200
Uh, I think I've found it.

1420
01:45:01,545 --> 01:45:03,035
Maybe. Um...

1421
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:05,650
Look, there appears to be a flaw
in the bomb's operating system.

1422
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,961
The remote detonator
requires that firing key.

1423
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:10,467
If we remove that key,
then it should short out

1424
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:12,966
the fail-safe and allow us
to cut both fuses.

1425
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,659
So one of us needs to get the detonator

1426
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:15,683
and remove that key.

1427
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:16,803
Benji: Yeah.

1428
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:19,719
While the rest of us cut the fuses
on both bombs. Simple.

1429
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:21,849
Yeah, but...

1430
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:23,564
But what?

1431
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:26,020
Well, in order to make this work,

1432
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:28,227
we can't remove the key
or cut the fuses

1433
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:31,067
until after the countdown starts.

1434
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:33,399
Ilsa: But Walt,
just so I've got this clear.

1435
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:36,068
Our only chance
to safely defuse both bombs

1436
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:38,028
1s to let the countdown start.

1437
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:41,490
And then remove that key.

1438
01:45:49,593 --> 01:45:50,924
Okay.

1439
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:04,729
(Whirring)

1440
01:46:07,695 --> 01:46:08,855
(Beeping)

1441
01:46:08,988 --> 01:46:12,321
Lane: Both devices are now
connected to the detonator.

1442
01:46:13,409 --> 01:46:15,365
Fifteen minutes should
give you enough time

1443
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:17,534
to reach minimum safe distance.

1444
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:22,118
My running days are over.

1445
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:25,284
This is where it ends for me.

1446
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,232
(Device beeping)

1447
01:46:53,949 --> 01:46:56,031
I'm getting signals all over the place.

1448
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:59,568
We're at a medical camp.
X-ray machines, cat scanners,

1449
01:46:59,663 --> 01:47:01,063
radiological signatures everywhere.

1450
01:47:01,206 --> 01:47:02,696
It's like a needle in a haystack.

1451
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:04,747
Process of elimination, one at a time.

1452
01:47:04,835 --> 01:47:06,621
Let's split up. Stay on comms.

1453
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:09,790
(Beeping continues)

1454
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:14,709
(Indistinct announcements over pa)

1455
01:47:16,972 --> 01:47:18,007
Julia: Ethan?

1456
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:24,934
Julia?

01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:31,103
Is that...

1458
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:36,446
Man: Julia!

1459
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:39,700
Does he know?

1460
01:47:40,871 --> 01:47:41,871
Man: Hey.

1461
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:44,663
Uh, this is my husband, Erik.

1462
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,080
Uh, this is...

1463
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:47,829
rob. rob Thorne.
Dr. rob Thorne.

1464
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:50,578
- I worked with Julia...
- At mass general.

1465
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:52,340
Before New York.

1466
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:53,755
Oh, you're kidding. (Chuckles)

1467
01:47:53,926 --> 01:47:55,666
- What a coincidence!
- I know. I...

1468
01:47:55,844 --> 01:47:57,675
- What brings you all this way?
- I was, uh...

1469
01:47:57,846 --> 01:47:59,757
I was in turtuk, not far from here

1470
01:48:00,015 --> 01:48:02,506
and heard help was needed.

1471
01:48:02,768 --> 01:48:03,768
Oh, well,

1472
01:48:03,936 --> 01:48:05,892
actually we're just about finished here.

1473
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:08,437
The whole village is inoculated.
But, uh...

1474
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:10,764
What were you doing out in turtuk?

1475
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:12,933
Rob's on vacation.

1476
01:48:13,112 --> 01:48:15,774
No. No, I'm... I'm working.

1477
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,819
You're a long way from home.

1478
01:48:20,077 --> 01:48:22,193
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks to our guardian angel.

1479
01:48:22,997 --> 01:48:23,997
Guardian?

1480
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:25,892
Well, yeah. We were
running a field hospital

1481
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:27,998
outside of Darfur when
the outbreak happened here.

1482
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:29,270
And here comes this phone call

1483
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:30,955
from an anonymous donor,
out of the blue.

1484
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:33,233
And, uh, he says
he's ready to underwrite

1485
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:35,748
the entire operation. One condition.

1486
01:48:36,218 --> 01:48:37,708
We run the whole thing.

1487
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:39,759
Erik: (Chuckles softly)
Can you believe that?

1488
01:48:40,931 --> 01:48:42,421
I certainly can.

1489
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:44,340
Yeah. Out of the blue.

1490
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:45,928
Out of the blue.

1491
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:49,929
That's quite a full life.

1492
01:48:50,107 --> 01:48:52,098
Yeah, you know, before Julia,
I never traveled.

1493
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:54,020
- (Beeping)
- I never even left New York.

1494
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,880
- Never left the hospital.
- (Beeping intensifies)

1495
01:48:55,904 --> 01:48:58,441
Seven days a week,
dusk till dawn. No vacations.

1496
01:48:58,615 --> 01:49:00,105
Ethan, I think I found something.

1497
01:49:02,244 --> 01:49:03,529
Heart attack at 55.

1498
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:06,616
And she convinced me
to let it all go.

1499
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:08,952
Help where it's needed most.

1500
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:11,162
So we've been on the go ever since,

1501
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,293
and I've never been more fulfilled.

1502
01:49:14,465 --> 01:49:16,126
I'm happy for you.

1503
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:18,377
Erik: Thank you.

1504
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:22,093
- Well, we should get going.
- Erik: Oh.

1505
01:49:22,181 --> 01:49:23,546
We have a lot of packing to do.

1506
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,722
Oh, no, I'll handle that.
You two should catch up.

1507
01:49:25,809 --> 01:49:27,470
Oh, no, I should
get out of your hair.

1508
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:29,684
(Chuckles) Are you kidding?
You should stick around.

1509
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:32,020
I'm just sorry you came
all this way for nothing.

1510
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:33,851
Um...

1511
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:36,608
Tell you what, we'll pack,

1512
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:38,815
and why don't we give you
a ride back to turtuk,

1513
01:49:38,906 --> 01:49:41,397
you two can catch up
in the car? Yeah?

1514
01:49:41,867 --> 01:49:43,357
You're very kind.

1515
01:49:44,286 --> 01:49:46,618
Settled. See you soon.

1516
01:49:46,705 --> 01:49:48,070
(Indistinct announcements over pa)

1517
01:49:48,165 --> 01:49:49,655
It was good to see you. (Chuckles)

1518
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:53,792
(Whispers) I am so sorry, Julia.
I'm so sorry.

1519
01:50:09,061 --> 01:50:10,471
(Indistinct chatter)

1520
01:50:15,067 --> 01:50:16,978
Take both helicopters.

1521
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:19,814
No one else leaves.

1522
01:50:27,913 --> 01:50:29,574
Benji: Careful, careful, careful.

1523
01:50:34,336 --> 01:50:35,336
Luther: It's armed.

1524
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:36,900
But the countdown hasn't started yet.

1525
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:38,733
The network signal's strong,
which means the other device

1526
01:50:38,757 --> 01:50:40,293
is close by and the detonator.

1527
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:42,799
About half a k in that direction.

1528
01:50:44,012 --> 01:50:45,422
They're still here.

1529
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:48,130
Luther, you keep working on it.

1530
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:49,298
You two, come with me.

1531
01:50:50,936 --> 01:50:53,268
Oh, sure. I got this.

1532
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:55,680
Don't worry about old Luther.

1533
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:18,921
(Beeping)

1534
01:51:29,725 --> 01:51:31,056
Ethan: Walker.

1535
01:51:35,063 --> 01:51:36,553
(Beeping)

1536
01:51:36,732 --> 01:51:37,732
Luther: Damn.

1537
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:39,272
Ethan, the countdown has started!

1538
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:40,439
We have 15 minufes.

1539
01:51:40,611 --> 01:51:42,272
Walker has the detonator.

1540
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:47,033
(Engine starts)

1541
01:51:52,039 --> 01:51:53,154
Come on, come on!

1542
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:56,785
We have to evacuate these people.

1543
01:51:56,877 --> 01:51:57,877
There's no time.

1544
01:51:58,045 --> 01:52:00,286
This whole valley's gonna be
incinerated in 15 minutes.

1545
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:05,416
Ilsa: It's too late!

1546
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:06,712
Ethan: No.

1547
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:08,297
I'm gonna get the detonator.

1548
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:10,511
- What? How?
- I'll figure it out.

1549
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,549
Find Lane!
Find the other bomb!

1550
01:52:14,811 --> 01:52:17,171
- [ What the hell is he doing?
- ] Find it best not to look.

1551
01:52:49,346 --> 01:52:50,836
(Devices beeping)

1552
01:52:52,724 --> 01:52:53,804
How we doing, Luther?

1553
01:52:54,017 --> 01:52:55,870
Tripwires everywhere.
I don't have enough hands.

1554
01:52:55,894 --> 01:52:57,009
Benji: Just make it happen.

1555
01:52:57,187 --> 01:52:58,222
Luther: Where's Ethan?

1556
01:52:58,313 --> 01:52:59,849
He's gone after the detonator.

1557
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:01,354
Wait, where's the detonator?

1558
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:03,060
(Beeping)

1559
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:12,785
(Grunts)

1560
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:21,961
(Gasps)

1561
01:53:37,728 --> 01:53:39,184
(Beeping)

1562
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:40,519
Julia: Luther.

1563
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:43,267
Julia. You shouldn't be here.

1564
01:53:43,442 --> 01:53:44,522
Oh, my god.

1565
01:53:45,193 --> 01:53:46,433
Oh, my god.

1566
01:53:46,862 --> 01:53:47,982
Is that what I think it 187?

1567
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:49,607
Benji: Luther, get her out of there!

1568
01:53:49,948 --> 01:53:51,609
Where is she gonna go?

1569
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:53,190
(Breathing heavily)

1570
01:53:53,285 --> 01:53:54,616
What can I do?

1571
01:53:56,788 --> 01:53:58,779
In the kit,
the pliers with the red grip.

1572
01:53:58,957 --> 01:54:01,494
- Benji: Are you insane?
- Mind your business, Benji.

1573
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:03,408
This is my business!

1574
01:54:30,739 --> 01:54:32,149
(Grunting)

1575
01:55:09,194 --> 01:55:10,400
(Grunting)

1576
01:55:17,077 --> 01:55:19,033
- (Groans)
(Alarm blaring)

1577
01:55:22,541 --> 01:55:23,576
(Screams)

1578
01:55:37,597 --> 01:55:38,712
(Alarm stops)

1579
01:55:45,981 --> 01:55:47,471
Ethan: Benji, do you copy?

1580
01:55:47,649 --> 01:55:49,389
Ethan! Ethan, where are you?

1581
01:55:49,734 --> 01:55:51,087
I'm in a helicopter going after Walker.

1582
01:55:51,111 --> 01:55:52,146
Hold on.

1583
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:53,923
How did you get in the helicopter?

1584
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:55,187
What, you can fly a helicopter?

1585
01:55:55,407 --> 01:55:56,647
Did you say helicopter?

1586
01:55:56,741 --> 01:55:58,902
What the hell are you doing
in a helicopter?

1587
01:55:59,077 --> 01:56:01,659
(Stammers) Just... hey, hey...
Did you find the other bomb?

1588
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,536
We're still looking,
but finding the bomb

1589
01:56:03,623 --> 01:56:05,543
is not gonna matter
unless we have the detonator.

1590
01:56:05,584 --> 01:56:07,449
I know. I know.
I'll get it. I'll get it!

1591
01:56:07,836 --> 01:56:09,827
Benji: Uh, if he's in
another helicopter,

1592
01:56:10,505 --> 01:56:12,666
- how are you gonna get it?
- I'll figure it out.

1593
01:56:12,924 --> 01:56:14,585
You find the bomb,
I'll get the detonator.

1594
01:56:14,676 --> 01:56:16,007
I won't let you down.

1595
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:18,635
I won't let you down.

1596
01:56:19,097 --> 01:56:21,509
- Be ready.
- Look, Ethan. Ethan!

1597
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:23,761
- (Voice breaking up)
- Ethan, come in!

1598
01:56:24,144 --> 01:56:26,305
Benji? Benji? Luther?

1599
01:56:27,272 --> 01:56:28,603
Anybody?

1600
01:56:30,066 --> 01:56:31,397
I can do this. I can do this.

1601
01:56:32,027 --> 01:56:33,107
What do we got here?

1602
01:56:33,195 --> 01:56:34,275
We've got airspeed.

1603
01:56:35,113 --> 01:56:36,444
Airspeed.

1604
01:56:36,948 --> 01:56:38,779
Okay, power. This is power.

1605
01:56:39,034 --> 01:56:40,034
(Loud crash)

1606
01:56:45,457 --> 01:56:48,369
Payload. How do I get rid
of this payload?

1607
01:56:56,718 --> 01:56:58,128
Power.

1608
01:57:08,063 --> 01:57:09,473
(Beeping)

1609
01:57:12,484 --> 01:57:13,878
- Luther: Wire strippers.
- (Beeping)

1610
01:57:13,902 --> 01:57:15,438
I'm a doctor, not an electrician.

1611
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:17,065
Sorry, the thing
with the green grip.

1612
01:57:17,614 --> 01:57:19,275
- Got it.
- The wire in my left hand.

1613
01:57:19,658 --> 01:57:21,489
- The black one?
- My left hand.

1614
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:23,992
- That's your left hand.
- Sorry, the other wire.

1615
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:25,197
The red one?

1616
01:57:25,288 --> 01:57:26,599
Yes, the red one in my right hand.

1617
01:57:26,623 --> 01:57:27,783
Just checking.

1618
01:57:28,041 --> 01:57:29,531
Oh, I like her.

1619
01:57:42,681 --> 01:57:44,012
Hold this for me, will you?

1620
01:57:46,768 --> 01:57:47,768
Holy shit!

1621
01:57:52,691 --> 01:57:53,691
Damn it!

1622
01:57:55,026 --> 01:57:56,436
Get up there!

1623
01:58:04,786 --> 01:58:06,117
That's right,

1624
01:58:06,538 --> 01:58:07,538
prick.

1625
01:58:16,339 --> 01:58:17,624
Oh, shit!

1626
01:58:24,514 --> 01:58:25,514
Son of a bitch.

1627
01:58:28,602 --> 01:58:29,602
All right.

1628
01:58:32,147 --> 01:58:33,182
Whoa!

1629
01:58:36,526 --> 01:58:38,232
(Alarm blaring)

1630
01:58:38,403 --> 01:58:39,768
Whoa, whoa, too much. Too much.

1631
01:58:40,697 --> 01:58:42,028
Oh, shit!

1632
01:58:42,741 --> 01:58:44,481
Automated voice: Pull up. Pull up.

1633
01:58:44,993 --> 01:58:48,906
- (Grunts)
- Terrain. Terrain. Pull up.

1634
01:58:49,164 --> 01:58:51,075
- Pull up.
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

1635
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:53,080
Terrain. Terrain.

1636
01:59:04,387 --> 01:59:05,593
(Shouts)

1637
01:59:10,935 --> 01:59:12,300
Benji, I'm not finding anything.

1638
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:14,101
I think we're looking
in the wrong place.

1639
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:15,724
Signatures everywhere.

1640
01:59:15,815 --> 01:59:17,251
This is the perfect place to hide it.

1641
01:59:17,275 --> 01:59:20,267
That's the point. I know Lane.
If we're looking here,

1642
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:23,270
it's because he wants us to.

1643
01:59:23,365 --> 01:59:24,525
(Beeping continues)

1644
01:59:25,742 --> 01:59:27,073
I'm heading to the village.

1645
01:59:27,243 --> 01:59:28,983
Just wait for me, all right?

1646
01:59:29,079 --> 01:59:30,489
(High-pitched whining)

1647
01:59:31,373 --> 01:59:34,115
Uh... Lisa, I think
I've found something.

1648
01:59:38,296 --> 01:59:40,628
Cut this wire right here.

1649
01:59:41,883 --> 01:59:45,091
Turn that screw counterclockwise,
very slowly.

1650
01:59:45,178 --> 01:59:46,178
Got it.

1651
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:49,970
So...

1652
01:59:51,976 --> 01:59:53,307
How is he?

1653
01:59:53,478 --> 01:59:55,935
Oh, you know. Same old Ethan.

1654
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:06,198
(Exhales) Jesus!

1655
02:00:10,286 --> 02:00:11,651
- Oh, shit!
(Alarm blaring)

1656
02:00:11,913 --> 02:00:13,449
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1657
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:24,463
- Benji, I see Lane.
“what? Where?

1658
02:00:24,634 --> 02:00:26,314
He's in a house
at the edge of the village.

1659
02:00:26,344 --> 02:00:27,959
All right, just wait for me, okay?

1660
02:00:28,304 --> 02:00:29,635
Lisa, wait for me!

1661
02:00:39,858 --> 02:00:41,098
No.

1662
02:00:41,192 --> 02:00:42,602
(Rapid beeping)

1663
02:00:44,112 --> 02:00:45,272
(Exhales sharply)

1664
02:00:45,739 --> 02:00:47,229
(Grunts) Nuclear bomb.

1665
02:00:52,036 --> 02:00:53,242
(Grunts)

1666
02:00:58,418 --> 02:00:59,418
Damn it!

1667
02:01:02,046 --> 02:01:03,877
- (Baby crying)
(Breathing heavily)

1668
02:01:07,385 --> 02:01:08,420
(Grunts)

1669
02:01:41,085 --> 02:01:42,621
(Rapid beeping)

1670
02:01:42,754 --> 02:01:44,585
Benji, I found the other bomb.

1671
02:01:45,215 --> 02:01:46,455
Lisa, where are you?

1672
02:01:46,633 --> 02:01:47,918
I'm in a house...

1673
02:01:48,009 --> 02:01:49,124
(Ilsa grunting)

1674
02:01:56,601 --> 02:01:57,966
(Alarm blaring)

1675
02:02:10,615 --> 02:02:12,776
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1676
02:02:13,117 --> 02:02:14,698
You're out of your mind!

1677
02:02:14,786 --> 02:02:16,367
I don't know what's down there.

1678
02:02:20,667 --> 02:02:22,282
Pull up, pull up!

1679
02:02:31,803 --> 02:02:34,135
This crazy son of a bitch
is trying to ram us!

1680
02:02:34,305 --> 02:02:35,636
Gol

1681
02:02:45,817 --> 02:02:47,307
(gun clicking)

1682
02:02:51,364 --> 02:02:52,695
(Panting)

1683
02:02:52,824 --> 02:02:53,824
Shit!

1684
02:02:54,325 --> 02:02:55,656
Luther: Benji, come in.

1685
02:02:55,827 --> 02:02:56,987
We're almost at the fuse.

1686
02:03:00,373 --> 02:03:02,364
Did you just say "other bomb"?

1687
02:03:02,542 --> 02:03:05,124
- Luther: Benji, do you read me?
- I'm working on it!

1688
02:03:05,461 --> 02:03:07,042
Lisa, where are you?

1689
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,540
(Device beeping rapidly)

1690
02:03:13,803 --> 02:03:14,963
(Groans softly)

1691
02:03:18,808 --> 02:03:20,469
(Choking)

1692
02:03:25,189 --> 02:03:27,020
- (Gasps)
- You can't stop it.

1693
02:03:27,483 --> 02:03:30,350
Do you understand?
There's nothing he can do.

1694
02:03:30,695 --> 02:03:31,901
When the clock runs out,

1695
02:03:31,988 --> 02:03:33,728
Ethan hunt will lose everything

1696
02:03:34,908 --> 02:03:36,318
and everyone

1697
02:03:37,493 --> 02:03:39,324
he ever cared about.

1698
02:03:40,622 --> 02:03:41,987
- Benji: Lisa!
(Grunts)

1699
02:03:42,081 --> 02:03:43,081
Benji!

1700
02:03:43,207 --> 02:03:44,287
Benji!

1701
02:03:44,375 --> 02:03:46,115
Benji: Lisa, where are you?

1702
02:03:47,462 --> 02:03:49,123
You don't want to see this.

1703
02:03:50,882 --> 02:03:52,042
Benji!

1704
02:03:52,216 --> 02:03:53,956
- Ilsa!
- Ilsa: Benji!

1705
02:03:54,552 --> 02:03:56,258
Benji! Benji, stop!

1706
02:03:57,013 --> 02:03:58,844
(Muffled shouting)

1707
02:04:00,934 --> 02:04:02,140
(Benji grunting)

1708
02:04:05,813 --> 02:04:06,813

(Both grunting)

1711
02:04:25,583 --> 02:04:26,698
Benji!

1712
02:04:33,675 --> 02:04:34,675
(Grunts)

1713
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:43,840
(Alarm beeping)

1714
02:04:53,653 --> 02:04:55,143
Oh, no, no, no!

1715
02:04:56,322 --> 02:04:57,937
(Groaning)

1716
02:05:02,662 --> 02:05:03,868

(Grunts and groans)

(Gasping)

1720
02:05:33,651 --> 02:05:34,982
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1721
02:05:38,448 --> 02:05:39,675
No, no.
Not when I'm this close.

1722
02:05:39,699 --> 02:05:41,564
Not when I'm this close.
Come on, come on!

1723
02:05:46,497 --> 02:05:47,577
(Grunting)

1724
02:05:51,502 --> 02:05:52,708
(Alarms blaring)

02:07:20,883 --> 02:07:22,874
(Gasping and coughing)

1733
02:07:28,099 --> 02:07:29,099
Thank you.

1734
02:07:29,392 --> 02:07:30,723
Tie him up.

1735
02:07:31,102 --> 02:07:32,217
(Beeping)

1736
02:07:36,524 --> 02:07:37,934
(Metal creaking)

1737
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:42,105
(Grunting)

1738
02:07:56,252 --> 02:07:57,662
(Ethan grunting)

1739
02:08:11,017 --> 02:08:12,052
(Yells)

1740
02:08:14,187 --> 02:08:16,018

(Beeping)

1743
02:08:34,165 --> 02:08:36,281
Why won't you just die?

1744
02:08:41,255 --> 02:08:42,836
(Both grunting)

1745
02:08:57,355 --> 02:08:58,470
(Beeping)

1746
02:08:58,606 --> 02:09:00,597
Luther: There's nothing else you can do.

1747
02:09:02,276 --> 02:09:04,187
Go be with your husband.

1748
02:09:05,446 --> 02:09:06,777
Luther...

1749
02:09:07,281 --> 02:09:08,361
Go.

1750
02:09:21,629 --> 02:09:22,629
Benji, where are you?

1751
02:09:23,214 --> 02:09:25,054
Okay, Luther, we're inside.
Tell us what to do.

1752
02:09:25,132 --> 02:09:27,544
You should see the red wire
attached to the motherboard.

1753
02:09:27,635 --> 02:09:28,635
Yeah.

1754
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:29,947
You need to cut that
and the green wire

1755
02:09:29,971 --> 02:09:31,962
next to it simultaneously.

1756
02:09:32,306 --> 02:09:33,637
- Okay, ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

1757
02:09:33,808 --> 02:09:34,808
- Set?
- Mmm-hmm.

1758
02:09:34,892 --> 02:09:36,974
- Cut.
- (Exhales)

1759
02:09:37,311 --> 02:09:39,643
I told you. It can't be stopped.

1760
02:09:39,981 --> 02:09:41,972
There's nothing you can do.

1761
02:09:51,617 --> 02:09:52,948
(Panting)

1762
02:09:55,037 --> 02:09:56,573
(Metal creaking)

1763
02:10:00,626 --> 02:10:02,036
(Beeping)

1764
02:10:08,968 --> 02:10:10,174

02:11:38,516 --> 02:11:39,516
(Grunts)

1771
02:11:48,567 --> 02:11:49,932
(Both grunting)

1772
02:12:29,191 --> 02:12:30,271
(Grunts)

1773
02:12:33,988 --> 02:12:35,819
(Breathing heavily)

1774
02:12:58,804 --> 02:12:59,964
(Rapid beeping)

1775
02:13:00,055 --> 02:13:03,138
Benji, listen. Turn the screw
counterclockwise.

1776
02:13:03,309 --> 02:13:04,309
Yep.

1777
02:13:05,436 --> 02:13:07,036
Luther: Remove that panel and you'll see

1778
02:13:07,062 --> 02:13:08,927
the power and ground wires
for the fuse.

1779
02:13:09,023 --> 02:13:10,023
Got it.

1780
02:13:10,191 --> 02:13:11,977
When the time comes,
cut the green wire.

1781
02:13:12,067 --> 02:13:13,682
Do not cut it yet.

1782
02:13:13,861 --> 02:13:14,896
Okay. We copy.

1783
02:13:20,409 --> 02:13:22,821
Ethan, if you can hear me,
we're ready to make the cut.

1784
02:13:23,704 --> 02:13:25,160
Ethan, come in.

1785
02:13:25,456 --> 02:13:28,038
Benji, how do we know
if he's got the key?

1786
02:13:28,501 --> 02:13:29,957
Luther: He'll get it.

1787
02:13:30,127 --> 02:13:32,539
- Yeah, but how do we know?
- He'll get it done!

1788
02:13:38,427 --> 02:13:40,509
We're out of time.
We just have to hope he has it.

1789
02:13:40,679 --> 02:13:42,670
- Okay, we're ready.
“at two seconds we cut.

1790
02:13:42,848 --> 02:13:44,368
Wait, wait, wait! Why two?
Why not one?

1791
02:13:44,517 --> 02:13:45,717
You want to cut it that close?

1792
02:13:45,768 --> 02:13:47,078
It's a second we'll never get back.

1793
02:13:47,102 --> 02:13:48,205
Can we make a decision on this?

1794
02:13:48,229 --> 02:13:49,664
All right, all right!
We'll do it on one.

1795
02:13:49,688 --> 02:13:50,688
Cutting on one?

1796
02:13:50,773 --> 02:13:51,973
Yes, one. All right, stand by.

1797
02:13:54,151 --> 02:13:55,151
Three...

1798
02:13:55,736 --> 02:13:57,647
- Two...
Luther: One.

1799
02:13:57,863 --> 02:13:59,103
- Now!
- (Benji grunts)

1800
02:14:10,376 --> 02:14:11,866
(Panting)

1801
02:14:18,175 --> 02:14:19,711
(Whirring)

1802
02:14:24,723 --> 02:14:26,679
- (Whirring)
(Rapid beeping)

1803
02:14:37,152 --> 02:14:38,813
Okay. (Exhales)

1804
02:14:42,324 --> 02:14:43,404
(Grunts)

1805
02:14:46,829 --> 02:14:48,035
(Exhales deeply)

1806
02:14:49,582 --> 02:14:50,992
My man.

1807
02:15:32,458 --> 02:15:33,493
(Inaudible)

1808
02:15:37,963 --> 02:15:39,294
Julia: Ethan?

1809
02:15:41,634 --> 02:15:42,794
Ethan?

1810
02:15:43,844 --> 02:15:45,380
Can you hear me?

1811
02:15:49,224 --> 02:15:50,714
Can you hear me?

1812
02:15:54,396 --> 02:15:56,136
Erik: No. Don't, don't, don't.

1813
02:15:57,066 --> 02:15:58,397
Don't try to move.

1814
02:15:58,817 --> 02:16:01,103
Don't move.
You're pretty banged up.

1815
02:16:04,073 --> 02:16:05,904
You're a lucky man.

1816
02:16:05,991 --> 02:16:08,403
It's a miracle that crash
didn't kill you, Dr. Thorne.

1817
02:16:08,744 --> 02:16:10,388
If your friend didn't find you
an hour later,

1818
02:16:10,412 --> 02:16:11,612
you would've died of exposure.

1819
02:16:12,039 --> 02:16:13,904
- My friends?
Yeah.

1820
02:16:16,502 --> 02:16:18,493
She got here
not long after you left.

1821
02:16:19,254 --> 02:16:21,666
Right in front of half
the Indian army.

1822
02:16:22,174 --> 02:16:24,665
Can you give us
a few minutes, please?

1823
02:16:26,595 --> 02:16:28,677
See you later, doc.

1824
02:16:35,104 --> 02:16:36,435
Julia...

1825
02:16:37,773 --> 02:16:38,853
I'm sorry.

1826
02:16:39,692 --> 02:16:41,353
There's no reason to be sorry.

1827
02:16:41,443 --> 02:16:42,443
No.

1828
02:16:42,695 --> 02:16:44,356
I'm sorry

1829
02:16:45,614 --> 02:16:47,605
for everything. I...

1830
02:16:49,201 --> 02:16:50,532
Look at me.

1831
02:16:51,453 --> 02:16:52,784
Look at me.

1832
02:16:53,247 --> 02:16:54,908
Look at my life.

1833
02:16:56,583 --> 02:17:00,075
I love what I do,
and I never would have

1834
02:17:00,170 --> 02:17:01,580
found this if I hadn't met you.

1835
02:17:02,756 --> 02:17:05,088
And everything that happened,

1836
02:17:05,843 --> 02:17:08,676
it taught me who I am.
It showed me

1837
02:17:08,887 --> 02:17:11,469
what I am capable of, and I...

1838
02:17:12,141 --> 02:17:13,927
I am a survivor.

1839
02:17:14,476 --> 02:17:16,137
But what happened here,

1840
02:17:17,521 --> 02:17:19,352
- it was my...
- Nothing happened.

1841
02:17:19,523 --> 02:17:21,514
Because you were here.

1842
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:26,943
And I sleep soundly at night
knowing you always will be.

1843
02:17:27,781 --> 02:17:28,816
(Sighs)

1844
02:17:36,248 --> 02:17:37,579
You're happy?

1845
02:17:37,833 --> 02:17:39,073
Very.

1846
02:17:42,254 --> 02:17:44,666
I'm exactly where I should be.

1847
02:17:47,009 --> 02:17:48,670
And so are you.

1848
02:18:22,753 --> 02:18:23,753
(Inaudible)

1849
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:29,256
Sloane: Per your request,

1850
02:18:30,886 --> 02:18:34,799
I'm handing Solomon Lane
back to MI6.

1851
02:18:38,685 --> 02:18:41,176
Through a broker, of course.

1852
02:18:43,357 --> 02:18:46,349
Part of our ongoing arrangement.

1853
02:18:51,281 --> 02:18:53,522
After what happened in Paris,

1854
02:18:54,034 --> 02:18:56,696
we prefer to keep a low profile.

1855
02:18:58,705 --> 02:19:03,165
And that closes your friend's account
with British intelligence.

1856
02:19:03,335 --> 02:19:04,700
(Chuckles)

1857
02:19:05,212 --> 02:19:07,373
The ribs. Watch the ribs.

1858
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:11,332
Sloane: I understand now
why hunley believed in you.

1859
02:19:12,010 --> 02:19:14,342
The world needs the imf.

1860
02:19:15,013 --> 02:19:17,174
We need people like you

1861
02:19:17,516 --> 02:19:19,006
who care about the one life

1862
02:19:20,269 --> 02:19:23,181
as much as they care about
the millions.

1863
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:26,271
That way

1864
02:19:26,525 --> 02:19:28,186
I hever have fo.

1865
02:19:29,027 --> 02:19:30,267
You okay?

1866
02:19:31,446 --> 02:19:33,027
You've never looked better.

1867
02:19:33,115 --> 02:19:35,356
- (Scoffs) Don't. Please.
- (Chuckles)

1868
02:19:36,285 --> 02:19:37,570
How close were we?

1869
02:19:40,455 --> 02:19:41,455
The usual.

1870
02:19:43,667 --> 02:19:44,747
(Chuckles)

1871
02:19:45,919 --> 02:19:47,830
The usual? (Laughing)

1872
02:19:49,214 --> 02:19:50,920
Please don't make me laugh.

1873
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:53,291
(Mission: Impossible theme playing)

1874
02:19:54,305 --> 02:20:54,921
