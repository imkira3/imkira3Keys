<i>The second star to the right</i>

2
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,584
<i>Shines in the night for you</i>

3
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,879
<i>To tell you that the dreams you plan</i>

4
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,800
<i>Really can come true</i>

5
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,220
<i>The second star to the right</i>

6
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,766
<i>Shines with a light so rare</i>

7
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:01,645
<i>And if it's Never Land you need</i>

8
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,774
<i>Its light will lead you there</i>

9
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,819
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star</i>

10
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:13,073
<i>So we'll know where you are</i>

11
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:17,160
<i>Gleaming in the skies above</i>

12
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,871
<i>Lead us to the land</i>

13
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:24,418
<i>We dream of</i>

14
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,839
<i>And when our journey is through</i>

15
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,425
<i>Each time we say</i>

16
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,469
<i>Good night</i>

17
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:40,434
<i>We'll thank the little star that shines</i>

18
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,689
<i>The second from</i>

19
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,276
<i>The right</i>

20
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,116
MAN: <i>All this has happened before.</i>

21
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,244
<i>And it will all happen again.</i>

22
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,331
<i>But this time it happened in London.</i>

23
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,045
<i>It happened on a quiet street
in Bloomsbury.</i>

24
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:14,092
<i>That corner house over there is
the home of the Darling family.</i>

25
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,179
<i>And Peter Pan chose
this particular house</i>

26
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,557
<i>because there were people here
who believed in him.</i>

27
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,851
<i>There was Mrs Darling.</i>

28
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,227
(HUMMING)

29
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,482
George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't
be late for the party, you know.

30
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,736
<i>Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan
was the spirit of youth.</i>

31
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,363
<i>But Mr Darling...</i>

32
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:38,909
Mary, unless I find my cuff links
we don't go to the party.

33
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,330
And if we don't go to the party, I can
never show my face in the office again.

34
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,998
And if I can never... Ow!

35
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,627
<i>Well, Mr Darling was a practical man.</i>

36
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,464
<i>The boys, however, John and Michael,</i>

37
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,300
<i>believed Peter Pan was a real person</i>

38
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,804
<i>and made him the hero
of all their nursery games.</i>

39
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,931
JOHN: Blast you, Peter Pan!

40
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:06,978
Take that! Give up, Captain Hook?
Give up?

41
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,856
Never! I'll teach you to cut off me hand!

42
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,943
Oh, no, John. It was the left hand.

43
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,570
Oh, yes. Thank you, Wendy.

44
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:19,116
<i>Wendy, the eldest, not only believed,</i>

45
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,369
<i>she was the supreme
authority on Peter Pan</i>

46
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,371
<i>and all his marvellous adventures.</i>

47
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,125
WENDY: Oh, Nana, must we always
take that nasty tonic?

48
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,128
<i>Nana, the nursemaid, being a dog,</i>

49
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,214
<i>kept her opinions to herself</i>

50
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,801
<i>and viewed the whole affair
with a certain tolerance.</i>

51
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,143
MICHAEL: Take that!

52
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,479
Insolent boy! I'll slash you to ribbons!

53
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,441
MICHAEL: And I'll cut you to pieces.

54
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,860
-Aha!
-JOHN: Ouch!

55
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,738
-Careful, Michael, my glasses.
-I'm sorry, John.

56
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,616
You'll never leave this ship alive!

57
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,452
Oh, yes, I will.

58
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,746
-(BOTH BOYS GRUNTING)
-MICHAEL: Take that!

59
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,921
Scuttle me bones, boy,
I'll slit your gizzard.

60
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,382
MICHAEL: Oh, no, you won't.

61
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,260
Back, back, back, you villain!

62
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,972
-Insolent pup!
-Wicked pirate!

63
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,141
JOHN: Aha, I got ya.

64
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,685
MICHAEL: You didn't either.
You never touched me.

65
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,856
Take that and that! And that!

66
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,108
Boys, boys, less noise, please.

67
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,947
-Oh, hello, Father.
-You old bilge rat.

68
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,658
Wh... What? Now, see here, Michael...

69
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,579
JOHN: Oh, not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.

70
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,624
-MICHAEL: And John's Captain Hook.
-Yes, yes, of course.

71
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,001
-Have you seen my cuff...
-(YELPS)

72
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,171
Oh, Nana, for goodness sake!

73
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,715
Where are those cuff links?

74
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:03,512
-Cuff links, Father?
-Yes, the gold ones.

75
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,973
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?

76
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,142
-I don't know.
-JOHN: The map then.

77
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,187
-Where's the treasure map?
-MICHAEL: It got lost.

78
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,565
-Good heavens, my shirt front!
-Hurray! You found it!

79
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,984
-You found it!
-Yes, so I have.

80
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,363
And hereafter... Don't paw me, Michael.

81
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,615
This is my last clean...

82
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,991
No!

83
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,160
No!

84
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,704
George, dear,
we must hurry or we'll be...

85
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,542
-Mary, look!
-George.

86
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,503
-It's only chalk, Father.
-Why, Michael.

87
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,798
It's not his fault. It's in the story.

88
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,176
-JOHN: And Wendy says...
-Wendy? Story?

89
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:47,055
I might have known. Wendy!

90
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,642
-Wendy!
-Yes, Father?

91
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,812
-Would you kindly ex...
-Oh, Mother!

92
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:57,107
-You look simply lovely.
-Thank you, dear.

93
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,276
-Wendy.
-Just my old gown made over.

94
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,029
-But it did turn out rather nicely...
-Mary, if you don't mind.

95
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,950
Why, Father,
what have you done to your shirt?

96
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,787
What have I... Oh!

97
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,832
Now, George, really. It comes right off.

98
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,420
That's no excuse.
Wendy, haven't I warned you?

99
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,047
Stuffing the boys' heads
with a lot of silly stories.

100
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,592
-Oh, but they aren't.
-I say they are!

101
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,428
Captain Crook! Peter Pirate!

102
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,013
Peter Pan, Father.

103
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,141
Pan! Pirate! Poppycock!

104
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,184
-Oh! No, Father.
-You don't understand.

105
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:37,939
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous...

106
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,232
Now, George.

107
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,401
"Now, George".

108
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,987
"Now, George"!

109
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,740
Well, "Now, George", will have his say!

110
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,074
Please, dear.

111
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,452
Mary, the child's growing up.

112
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,455
It's high time
she had a room of her own.

113
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,081
-Father!
-George

114
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,666
-What?
-No!

115
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,169
I mean it!

116
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,922
Young lady, this is your last night
in the nursery.

117
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,383
And that's my last word on the matter...

118
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,844
(STAMMERING)

119
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,640
-GEORGE: Oh... Ah...
-(SCREECHING)

120
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,690
No!

121
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,028
No!

122
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,030
(CRASH)

123
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,788
ALL: Oh!

124
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,627
ALL: Poor Nana.

125
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,921
"Poor Nana"?

126
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,882
This is the last straw!

127
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,468
Out! Out, I say!

128
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,096
-No, Father, no!
-Yes!

129
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,766
There'll be no more dogs
for nursemaids in this house!

130
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,019
Goodbye, Nana.

131
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:03,274
"Poor Nana". Oh, yes, "Poor Nana".

132
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,112
But "Poor Father"? Oh, no!

133
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,365
Blast it! Where is that rope?

134
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,660
Oh, thank you.

135
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,459
Dash it all, Nana,
don't look at me like that.

136
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,003
It's nothing personal. It's just that...

137
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:30,009
Well, you're not really a nurse at all.
You're... Well, a dog.

138
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,847
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.

139
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,434
And sooner or later, Nana,
people have to grow up.

140
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,979
But, Mother, I don't want to grow up.

141
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,358
Now, dear, don't worry
about it any more tonight.

142
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:49,237
He called Peter Pan
"absolute poppycock".

143
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,075
I'm sure he didn't mean it, John.
Father was just upset.

144
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:58,830
Poor Nana,
(SNIFFLES) out there all alone.

145
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,958
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.

146
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,501
She'll be all right.

147
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,172
-Mother.
-What is it, dear?

148
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,092
-Buried treasure.
-Now, children.

149
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,720
Don't judge your father too harshly.

150
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,432
After all, he really loves you very much.

151
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,186
Oh, don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.

152
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,564
-"Ð

153
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,651
You see, I found something
that belongs to him.

154
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,237
Oh? And what's that?

155
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,072
(YAWNS) His shadow.

156
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,449
"Shadow"?

157
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,992
WENDY: Mmm. Nana had it.

158
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,078
But I... But I took it away.

159
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:45,084
Oh? Yes, of course.

160
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,837
Good night, dear.

161
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,427
But, George, do you think the children
will be safe without Nana?

162
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,763
Safe? Of course they'll be safe.
Why not?

163
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,266
Well, Wendy said something
about a shadow, and I...

164
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,186
-Shadow? Whose shadow?
-Peter Pan's.

165
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,523
Oh, Peter Pan... Peter Pan!

166
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:11,653
You don't say. Goodness gracious,
whatever shall we do?

167
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,196
-But, George...
-Sound the alarm!

168
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,616
-Call Scotland Yard!
-There must have been someone.

169
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,120
Oh, Mary, of all the impossible,
childish fiddle-faddle.

170
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,955
Peter Pan indeed.

171
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,291
How can we expect the children
to grow up and be practical...

172
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,335
-George...
-... when you're as bad as they are.

173
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,255
GEORGE: No wonder Wendy
gets these idiotic ideas.

174
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,080
Over there, Tink, in its den.

175
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,748
Is it there?

176
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,461
Must be here somewhere.

(MUSIC PLAYS)

178
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,177
Tink! Shh.

179
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,557
Stop playing
and help me find my shadow.

180
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,728
Shadow. Oh, shadow.

Aha!

Peter Pan! Oh, Peter!

186
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,086
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.

187
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,254
Oh, I do hope it isn't rumpled.

188
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,174
You know, you look exactly
the way I thought you would.

189
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,802
Oh, a little taller perhaps. But then...

190
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,930
Oh, you can't stick it on with soap, Peter.

191
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,391
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.

192
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,020
Come to think of it, I've never thought
about it, sewing shadows.

193
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,690
Of course, I knew it was your shadow
the minute I saw it.

194
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,110
I said to myself, "I'll put it away
for him until he comes back.

195
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,822
"Oh, he's sure to come back".
And you did, didn't you, Peter?

196
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,825
After all, one can't leave
his shadow lying about

197
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,869
and not miss it sooner or later.
Don't you agree?

198
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,290
What I don't understand is how
Nana got it in the first place.

199
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,459
She really isn't... Oh, sit down.
It won't take long.

200
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,713
She really isn't vicious.
She's a wonderful nurse.

-Father says...
-Girls talk too much.

Yes, girls talk too... Hmm? Oh.

203
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,263
Well, get on with it, girl.

207

But how did Nana get
your shadow, Peter?

208
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,190
PETER: Jumped at me the other night
at the window.

209
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,984
WENDY:
Well, what were you doing there?

210
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,028
PETER: I came to listen to the stories.

211
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,531
My stories? But they're all about you.

212
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,744
Of course. That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.

00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,455
The Lost Boys... Oh, I remember.

-They're your men.
-Uh-huh.

215
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,209
WENDY: Iâ€™m so glad
you came back tonight.

216
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,420
-I might never have seen you.
-Why?

217
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,423
-Because I have to grow up tomorrow.
-Grow up!

218
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,675
Tonight's my last night in the nursery.

219
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,428
But that means no more stories.

220
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,347
(SNIFFLING) Mmm-hmm.

221
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,600
No! I won't have it. Come on!

222
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,643
WENDY: Bu... But where are we going?

223
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,437
PETER: To Never Land.

224
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,566
-Never Land!
-PETER: You'll never grow up there.

225

WENDY: Oh, Peter,
it will be so wonderful.

226
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,491
But wait. What would Mother say?

227
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,743
Mother? What's Mother?

228
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,871
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who...

229
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,248
Who loves and cares for you

230
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,418
-and tells you stories.
-Good! You can be our mother.

231
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,587
-Come on.
-Now, just a minute, I...

232
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,714
Let me see now. I have to pack.

233
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,218
Oh, and I must leave a note when
I'll be back. I couldn't stay too long.

234
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,471
And then I'll have to...
Oh, but Never Land.

Oh, I... I'm so happy I...

-Fly?

I never thought about it before.

Oh, yes. Always, captain.

623
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,958
You'd better talk, me dear,
for soon the tide will be in

624
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,918
and then it will be too late.

625
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:42,714
I'll show the old codfish.
Stay here, and watch the fun.

626
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,007
Fun?

627
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,925
HOOK: Remember,

628
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,262
there is no path through water

629
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,973

630

This is your last chance, Tiger Lily!

00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,524
Manatoa, great spirit
of mighty seawater, speak!

632
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,570
Beware, Captain Hook!

633
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,239
(ECHOING) Beware! Beware!

634
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:12,160
-Did you hear that, Smee?
-It's an evil spirit, captain.

635
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,955
Stand by, Smee,
while I take a look around.

636
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,667
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?

637
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,893
Psst... Wendy. Watch this.

(IMITATING HOOK) Mr Smee!

Uh, yes, captain?

640
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:48,279
Release the princess
and take her back to her people.

641
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,866
Aye, aye, sir. Release the princess...

642
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,118
But... But, captain...

643
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,622
Those are me orders, Mr Smee!

644
00:40:58,498 --> 00:40:59,874
Aye, aye, sir.

Odd's fish!

647
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,051
I told him you Indians
wouldn't betray Peter Pan. But...

648
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:14,681
And just what do you think
you are doing, Mr Smee?

649
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:18,851
Just what you told me, captain.
Carryin' out your orders.

650
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,187
My orders?

651
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,690
Yes, captain. Didn't you just say to go...

652
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:27,276
Put her back! You blithering idiot!

653
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,571
My orders. Of all the bumbling...

654

PETER: (AS HOOK) Mr Smee!

655

Just exactly what do you
think you are doing?

656
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,080
Putting her back like you said, captain.

657
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,499
I said nothing of the sort!

658
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,335
(STAMMERING) But, captain,
didn't you? I thought that...

659
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,504
For the last time, Mr Smee.

660
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,675
Take the princess back to her people.

661
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:54,178
Understand?

662
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,722
(ECHOING)

663
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,557
Aye, aye, sir.

664
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,851
Oh. And one more thing.

665
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,104
When you return to the ship,
tell the whole crew

666
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,940
to help themselves to me best rum.

Here's your spirit, Smee!

669
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,741
Why, it's Peter Pan.

670
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,659
Whew.

671
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,038
-Scurvy brat!
-Thank you, captain.

672
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:23,791
Come down, boy,
if you've a taste for cold steel.

673
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,376
Watch this, Wendy.

674
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,336
Oh, Peter, do be careful.

-Try your luck, Mr Smee?
-HOOK: Let him have it!

HOOK: Well, come on, you idiot!
Blast him!

677

Right here, Mr Smee.

678

Hold it, you fool! No! No!

679
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,535
Captain?

680
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:02,705
Oh, how dreadful.

681
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:07,752
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear captain.

Captain!

In the back, captain?

684
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,518
Give it to him, captain!

685
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,394
Cleave him to the brisket!

686
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,911
I've got you this time, Pan.

No.

We mustn't annoy him.

Well, captain, it's nice
to see you smiling again.

Oh, captain,
why don't we put to sea again?

You know, there's trouble
brewin' on the island.

that the first mate told him

Did you say Pan
has banished Tinker Bell?

Aye, aye, captain. He has.

00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,250
-But why?
-Well, on account of Wendy, captain.

742

Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.

743
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:06,842
-Well, well.
-That's why we ought to leave, captain.

If we impress the pixie, convince her

To tell the boys
we sails with the tide, sir.

758
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:58,102
You will go ashore, pick up Tinker Bell

759
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,896
and bring her to me.
