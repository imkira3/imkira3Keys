Hey, Seth Rogen.
What up, man?

3
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,128
Oh, hey, John!
Over here!

4
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,090
<i>Welcome to Los
Angeles International Airport.</i>

5
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,969
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

6
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,963
<i>Do not leave your
baggage unattended.</i>

7
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,611
<i>All unattended baggage
is subject to search...</i>

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,921
Yay!

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,809
We're so happy!

10
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,086
Look at this!

11
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,446
What's happening, man?

12
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,806
Good to see you, buddy.

13
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,325
How you doing?
I'm good, man.

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,441
Yes, you are.

15
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,201
How long has it been, man?

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,446
Sometime in the last...

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,488
Inside of a year or something.
Yeah.

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,200
I have the best weekend
ever planned, man.

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,682
Lay it on me. Ooh!
I don't want to ruin it.

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,485
Seth Rogen!
Shit, here we go. Hey.

21
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,925
How's it going, man?
Yeah, good.

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,771
So, you, like, always play, like,
the same guy in every movie.

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,569
When are you gonna do some,
like, real acting, man?

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,641
Okay, thank you.

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,722
Give me something. Give
me, like, the laugh, man.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,131
Give me the Seth Rogen laugh.

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,601
Seth Rogen, everybody.

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,968
All right, I've landed. I'm here.
We've said our hellos.

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,044
Can we please go to
fucking Carl's Jr.?

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,641
Oh.

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,803
I would... I would love to.
I'm on a...

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,441
I can't really eat
that stuff right now.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,760
I'm on a, uh...
What?

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,841
I'm on this cleanse.

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,649
You're...
You're on a what?

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm on a cleanse.

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,008
What?
It's good for you.

38
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,730
I didn't know... You're supposed
to take six shits a day.

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,245
That's not true.
It is true!

40
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,841
You're supposed to
shit twice a day. No.

41
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,530
That's not true. That's
what they used to think.

42
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,887
Now they know you're supposed
to shit six times a day.

43
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,531
So you're not drinking. You're
not smoking weed. You're not...

44
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,405
No, no, I'm drinking and
smoking weed. But...

45
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,164
I'm on a cleanse.
I'm not psychotic.

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,004
Look, man, if you
stopped eating gluten,

47
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,162
you'd feel way fucking
better all day.

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,200
Whenever you feel shitty,
that's 'cause of gluten.

49
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,366
That's not true.
It is.

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,482
Who the fuck told you not to eat gluten?
It's just true.

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,164
You don't even know
what gluten is.

52
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,480
I know what fucking gluten is.

53
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,806
No, you have no idea
what gluten is.

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,881
I do know what gluten is.

55
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,485
Gluten's a vague term.

56
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,643
It's something that's used to categorize
things that are bad, you know?

57
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,371
Calories, that's a gluten.
Fat, that's a gluten.

58
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,489
Somebody just told you you
probably shouldn't eat gluten,

59
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,244
you're like, "Oh, I guess
I shouldn't eat gluten."

60
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,482
Gluten means bad shit, man,
and I'm not eating it.

61
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,011
Mmm!

62
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,441
Mmm-hmm.
Oh!

63
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,521
God!

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,280
Each bite is better
than the previous bite.

65
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,964
It is.
Gluten!

66
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,681
Hey, this looks beautiful.

67
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,205
Yeah. Do you like it?
I totally redid it.

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,281
It's fucking awesome.

69
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,566
It's all new.
Those are new.

70
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,284
God damn, son!
It's pretty nice, huh?

71
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,561
So this is how the other half lives.

72
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,364
Come on.
Amazing.

73
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,363
Air hockey tables.
Jesus Murphy!

74
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,010
Right? Okay,
get ready, Jay.

75
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,047
What?

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,167
I have a little
surprise for you.

77
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,207
Okay.

78
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,567
Here's the best weekend you
ever had in your life. Oh!

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,206
Look at it, man.

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,884
Oh, my...
Are you serious?

81
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,086
It's all of your
favorite things.

82
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,567
Starburst and Airheads on a...
Yeah.

83
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,607
And it says "Jay."

84
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,409
In joints.
In joints.

85
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,369
It says "Jay" in jays.

86
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,681
Seth Rogen, you are
just the best people.

87
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,161
Come on, I know you don't love it
in LA, so I figure I'll make it...

88
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,641
You know, I'll lube up
your entry a little bit.

89
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,722
It eases the transition.
Yeah, right?

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,410
This is the
much-needed foreplay.

91
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,481
You know what else I got?

92
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,766
Yo, this...

93
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,285
A 3-D television.
No, you didn't...

94
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,249
I got a 3-D TV.
Are you serious?

95
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,727
Oh, my God.
I did it, man.

96
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,040
What?

97
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,610
Let's get into it.

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,364
Oh, my God, bud.

99
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,925
It's Gandalf the Grey's pipe.

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,240
Damn, no shit.

101
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,488
Hello, little hobbit.

102
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,927
Spark my ganja.
Yeah.

103
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,687
I'm a well-known
homosexual advocate.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

113
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,971
I need a break.

114
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,046
Oh. You know what,
actually?

115
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,963
We should go to
Franco's house soon.

116
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,320
He's having
a housewarming party.

117
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,811
He just finished
building his house.

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,920
I haven't even seen it yet,

119
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,803
but it's supposed
to be bonkers.

120
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,086
I haven't been
in LA in, like, a year,

121
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,448
and I came here
to chill with you.

122
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,648
We can chill together, and we'll
chill with those other guys.

123
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,643
We'll all chill
as one big unit.

124
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,131
Will I even know anybody there?

125
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,247
You know James Franco.

126
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,641
James Franco doesn't
even know my name.

127
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,926
Jonah Hill will be there.

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,490
Can't stand him.
He can't stand me.

129
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,291
He's, like, the nicest guy in the world!
He likes you so much.

130
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,169
He specifically talks
about how he likes you.

131
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,401
Out of nowhere, he just
said, "You know what?"

132
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,527
"Jay's an inspiration."

133
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,251
There's no way he said that.
Also, just can't stand him.

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,924
Okay, fine.
Craig Robinson.

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,001
Never met him.

136
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,491
He's hilarious.

137
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,648
Sweats a lot,
but he's a great guy.

138
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,245
So it's gonna be fun, man.

139
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,730
For you, I will go.

140
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,371
I promise, I'll stay
with you all night, okay?

141
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,683
I won't ditch you. No, 'cause I
want to be with you all night.

142
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,922
And you know why else?

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,367
'Cause nobody puts
Jay in the corner.

144
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,886
Awesome.

145
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,927
Wow!

146
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,644
Thank you. Thank you.
There you go. Cool.

147
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,250
Thanks a lot, eh?
Thanks a lot.

148
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,367
Okay, man.

149
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,490
Holy shit.

150
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,690
Wow!

151
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,165
This is crazy!

152
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,527
Yeah?
Yeah, man, right?

153
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,728
Look at it.
A bit much.

154
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,245
I don't think it is a bit much.

155
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,560
I think it's right
on the money.

156
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,165
What is he, Pablo Escobar?

157
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,526
Come on, man, this is
an awesome street.

158
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,284
Channing Tatum lives up there.

159
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,124
Oh, for the love of... Will
you stop talking about...

160
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,321
This is the sexiest
street in America.

161
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,526
You and Channing Tatum.

162
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,886
I think he's attractive.

163
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,163
I think it's a cool house.
I know you do.

164
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,765
I can't wait to see inside it.

165
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,444
That's why I'm excited.

166
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,241
Ha-ha! Yes!
What's up, man? Seth!

167
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,243
So happy you're here.
I'm so happy to be here.

168
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,560
Hey, Johnny, what's up?

169
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,085
It's Jay.
It's Jay.

170
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,527
I'll never forget it again, man.
Good to see you.

171
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,329
Nice to see you. Come on in.
Yeah! Yeah, great.

172
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,641
Check it out.
My new place!

173
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,449
Awesome, man!

174
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,686
Designed it myself.

175
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,525
Really cool. This place
is beautiful, man.

176
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,602
This place is
like a piece of me.

177
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,762
You two just stepped inside me.

178
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,926
You let us both
cum inside you. Yeah.

179
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,731
Icing on the cake.
Check it out.

180
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,527
Painted them myself.

181
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,921
Huh.

182
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,923
Side by side.
A team.

183
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,047
Holy shit.

184
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,249
So, is it weird?

185
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,288
No.
You sure?

186
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,044
I really like it.

187
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,246
What do you think, Jay?

188
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,448
I'm not a big art guy.

189
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,806
You don't like art?

190
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,769
Well, come on...

191
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,763
You play video games?
Yes.

192
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,888
Well, guess what, buddy?
You like art.

193
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,961
Yep.

194
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,166
You ever been to Subway?

195
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,287
Yes.

196
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,771
You order a sandwich?

197
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,968
Somebody put that together for you, dude.
That's art.

198
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,121
Sandwich artist.

199
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,440
So, let me
lay this on you, Jay.

200
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,521
Oh, fuck.

201
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,806
Your mama's pussy
was the canvas.

202
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,644
Your dad's dick
was the paintbrush.

203
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,722
Boom.
You're the art. Huh?

204
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,244
Thanks, James Franco.
You got it.

205
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,810
Seth!
Mindy, hello.

206
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,484
Oh, my God, great to see you.
Oh, you, too.

207
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,800
Long time.
How's it going?

208
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,167
You know Jay? I don't think
I've ever actually met you.

209
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,890
You were so good in
<i>Million Dollar Baby.</i>

210
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,002
That's amazing. Thank you
so much for saying that.

211
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,003
Oh, my God, if I don't
fuck Michael Cera tonight,

212
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,088
I'm gonna blow my brains out.
What?

213
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,367
Fucking pale, 110 pounds,

214
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,922
hairless, probably has a huge
cock, coked out of his mind...

215
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,241
You can do a lot better.
That's just trouble.

216
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,881
So, Ri-Ri, how about you,
you ever see a psychiatrist?

217
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,166
Um...

218
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,320
That's not cool.
Don't touch my butt, bitch.

219
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,448
Michael, that's not cool. Would
you shut the fuck up, Jason!

220
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,409
We're playing a game, man.

221
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,649
Say cheese, baby.

222
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,445
What's up, buddy?
How's it going, dude?

223
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,726
Good to see you, man.

224
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,370
Is that Jay Baruchel?
Hi, there. Hey.

225
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,521
Oh, my God, get in here, dude.

226
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,240
How's it going, Jonah?
What are you doing?

227
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,521
Good. How you doing, buddy?
Oh, my gosh.

228
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,648
Welcome back.
Thank you very much.

229
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,609
When'd you get in?
Uh, this morning,

230
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,523
and boy, are my arms tired.

231
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,326
Dude, that's great.

232
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,401
- Thank you.
- Sick.

233
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,005
What have you guys been doing?

234
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,923
Oh, we just hung out all day.

235
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,925
Ate a bunch of dirty burgers, and
smoked about a fucking pound of weed

236
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,411
and played
a bunch of video games.

237
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,721
Weed is tight. Weed is tight.
That's awesome.

238
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,040
That's awesome.
Weed is awesome.

239
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,447
It was like the golfing
sequence in <i>Navy SEALs.</i>

240
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,568
Sick reference, though, bro.
Oh, thanks, bud.

241
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,802
Dude, your references are out of control.
Everyone knows that.

242
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,484
Hey, thanks, man.
I'm jealous.

243
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,847
I would have been there
in a heartbeat,

244
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,242
but, uh, I actually just adopted
this incontinent spaniel.

245
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,401
She's a really beautiful soul.

246
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,130
Her name's Ahjhai.
Ahjhai?

247
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,247
Yeah.
How do you spell it?

248
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,127
You want to see
a picture of her?

249
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,248
Oh, she's so sweet.
Hey!

250
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,560
- Look at her.
- Aw!

251
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,324
She can't bark. She
doesn't know how, so...

252
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,481
She doesn't know
how to bark, even?

253
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,561
She doesn't know how to bark,

254
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,244
so I've tried to teach her

255
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,482
and she just kind of
screams, and so she was up,

256
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,245
had her face smushed against
the cage, and was, like...

257
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,560
Ah!

258
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,851
Yeah, cool. Um...

259
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,807
Tell you what, boys,
I'm kind of jonesing,

260
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,248
so I'm gonna find someone I can bum
a smoke off of outside, all right?

261
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,089
That's tight, dude.
Honestly, I like you.

262
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,161
Hey, likewise.

263
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,691
Okay, dude, come back.

264
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,604
I'll be right back. You're holding court.
All right, boys.

265
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,884
Dude. I know. I think we're
making some progress.

266
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,927
That was really good.

267
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,361
And honestly,
he's your old friend.

268
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,765
We're your new friends.
He feels threatened.

269
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,841
Yeah, man.

270
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,610
You know, and I get it.

271
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,647
It's gonna be fine.

272
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,120
I honestly think
tonight's the night

273
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,360
we bust this whole thing open.

274
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,563
And I'm lucky. It's the
same thing a lot, though.

275
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,290
It's, like, my TV wife
opens the fridge,

276
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,204
and is, like, "What happened
to the birthday cake?"

277
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,965
And I come outwith, like,
a little frosting, like,

278
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,401
"What birthday cake?"

279
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,044
'Cause you ate the cake! Yeah.

280
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,326
'Cause you ate the cake!

281
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,640
"It's my birthday."

282
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,051
That's why y'all number one.
'Cause of that.

283
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,447
You're Jay, right?
Yeah.

284
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,521
Seth's boy?
Yeah.

285
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,886
How you doing, man?
Good to see you.

286
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,041
Good.
Likewise, likewise.

287
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,082
I'm Craig, man. This is Emma.
Hi. Hi, there.

288
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,811
You just in town
visiting him, or what?

289
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,043
Yeah. Just for a little
visit, you know.

290
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,122
I try to not come
down here very much.

291
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,486
I don't really love it here.

292
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,527
You don't like LA?

293
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm just not really
into the LA lifestyle.

294
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,206
What lifestyle are you into?

295
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,806
Look at him. He's, like,
a hipster, right?

296
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,451
No, I'm not a hipster, at all.

297
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,126
Yeah, yeah, you do seem
to hate a lot of things,

298
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,884
and the bottom of your
pants are awful tight.

299
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,806
No, I just... I don't like Los Angeles.
It doesn't make me a hipster.

300
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,121
I'll bet you hate movies
that are universally loved.

301
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,201
I don't even...

302
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,361
You like <i>Forrest Gump?</i>

303
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,011
No, no, it's a horrendous
piece of shit.

304
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,162
"Life is like a box
of chocolates," no?

305
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,770
Yeah, no, I'm familiar with it.

306
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,047
"You never know
what you're gonna get."

307
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,965
Why don't we do a sequel
to <i>Pineapple Express?</i>

308
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,445
I would love to do
a sequel to <i>Pineapple.</i>

309
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,521
Do you have any ideas, or...

310
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,204
I do have an idea.
What?

311
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,489
It's that Red, Danny, has
become, like, the drug lord,

312
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,528
you know, since we
killed the other one,

313
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,682
and he wants to assassinate
Woody Harrelson,

314
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,770
'cause he's gonna give a speech
that makes all of weed legal,

315
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,207
effectively rendering
drug lords out of business.

316
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,129
Awesome. Yeah, it's
fucking awesome,

317
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,806
but we don't have... We don't
know how it should end yet.

318
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,166
I... I know.

319
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,886
Danny's trying to kill us. Yeah.

320
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,566
And I sacrifice myself for you.

321
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,086
And he kills me,

322
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,491
and I die for you.

323
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,209
And Danny fucking eats me.

324
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,163
Why does he eat you?
I don't know.

325
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,766
I'm just trying to think of,
like, the nastiest way to go.

326
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,241
Yeah, he could eat you.
Okay. That's a good idea, man.

327
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,607
He's just out of his mind.
He just, like, eats me.

328
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,286
Hey, Chris.
How's it going?

329
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,328
Hey, does this coke smell funny?
Ooh!

330
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,323
Fuck! Michael, what
the fuck, man?

331
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,970
That's expensive shit,
motherfucker!

332
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,121
What are you doing?

333
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,600
I've never fucking done cocaine, dude.
Why does it fucking...

334
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,569
Well, you did the best shit
possible for your first time,

335
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,681
'cause that's good fucking...

336
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,966
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
I'm nervous, dude.

337
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,365
I don't know what... What
is wrong with you, man?

338
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,521
Look, he's freaking out.
Oh, shit.

339
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,045
I've never done this
fucking drug before, man.

340
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,121
Mike, please.

341
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,850
I'll walk you through it.
I will walk you through it.

342
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,649
Mike, no one...
I'll be your guide.

343
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,364
You're fine, Chris. You're fine.
Is it on...

344
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,521
You got some in
your mustache, baby.

345
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,647
What are you...
Michael!

346
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,923
Now, fellas, I
want you to real sexy right now.

347
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,082
We're gonna sing
to all the ladies.

348
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,602
All the fellas go like this,
in your Barry White voice.

What's not kid-friendly?

374
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,845
There's a lot of sharp edges.
Concrete, sharp edges.

375
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,649
He's gonna bust his head
open on one of those things.

376
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,840
A kid could fall off this
fucking railing right here.

377
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,609
That's why you have the
railing, so they don't fall.

378
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,683
Hey. Sorry. I want to
have kids one day.

379
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,366
Hey, Jay.
Oh, hey, hi, Jonah.

380
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,442
Is there any place around here I
can buy a pack of cigarettes?

381
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,607
Yeah.

382
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,921
There's a place like, it's
like, four blocks away, maybe.

383
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,325
You want to come with me?

384
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,408
Give me this much time.
That much joint time.

385
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,886
Oh!

386
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,769
Jesus!
Hey, Jay.

387
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,288
Hey, you need to use the toilet, honey?
Go ahead.

388
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,763
Nope, I'm... I sorry.

389
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,361
Who wants a sip?
Sip time.

390
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,601
You okay, man?

391
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,364
It's nothing.
It's just, you know,

392
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,569
as soon as we got there, you did
what you said you wouldn't do.

393
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,967
What did I do? You just
fucking ditched my ass.

394
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,850
I didn't ditch you.
Are you kidding me, man?

395
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,126
I did not ditch you.

396
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,568
I was talking to Jonah, and then
you left to go have a cigarette.

397
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,723
Well, you know, my
cigarette was an excuse.

398
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,882
I really went outside 'cause
Jonah was being a prick.

399
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,644
Jonah was not being a prick.

400
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,245
If anything, you were
kind of being a prick.

401
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,890
Jonah's the nicest
guy ever, man.

402
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,691
Oh, my God, that's a
thin veneer of kindness.

403
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,761
Nobody's that nice.

404
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,921
Jonah is that nice.

405
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,565
Serial killers are that nice.

406
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,563
Just answer me one question.

407
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,927
Is Michael Cera's butthole
as adorable as I pictured?

408
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,240
Oh, for fuck's sake.

409
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,368
I picture it looking
like a little donut,

410
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,044
like a little
pink sprinkled donut.

411
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,084
Oh, it's so bright in here.

412
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,764
It is fucking bright.

413
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,604
Oh, I'm so high.

414
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,127
There's so many delicious choices.
What do I do?

415
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,089
I'm gonna get something to drink.
Okay.

416
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,924
Excuse me, would it be possible

417
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,445
for my daughter to
use your restroom?

418
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,965
She's really got to go.

419
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,441
Read the sign.
Customers only.

420
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,521
Seriously?

421
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,251
Why the fuck you think
I put up the sign?

422
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,084
It's okay, Dad.
I can hold it.

423
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,680
Let's just buy
something for your mother.

424
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,331
Yeah, well,
I guess you better, huh?

425
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,164
This cash register lady
is mean.

426
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,969
I have anxiety. Will
you buy this for me?

427
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,485
When I'm stoned,
I can't do this.

428
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,767
I think I'm just gonna
head back to your place.

429
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,724
I'm not really liking it very
much over there at Franco's.

430
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,241
Dude, I want you to get to know these guys.
That's never gonna happen

431
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,244
if you don't put in any
effort whatsoever, okay?

432
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,890
I hate it in there.

433
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,566
I just want to drink some
pop and smoke some weed.

434
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,720
What about...

435
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,164
What about me?

436
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,930
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

437
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,411
Did you just see that?

438
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,811
What the hell?

439
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,970
Oh, my God, Jesus, Jesus!
Run, run, run!

440
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,004
This way!
Okay, okay, okay!

441
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,849
Oh, my God!
Oh, oh...

442
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,200
Oh, Jesus.

443
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,886
Run!

444
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,291
Jesus Christ!

445
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,564
Why the fuck did you
bring me down here?

446
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,882
The fuck, Seth? I don't
know what's happening!

447
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,049
We're going back to Franco's.
Why?

448
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,047
Just run!
Keep running!

449
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,360
Oh, my fuck!

450
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,202
We are going back to Franco's!

451
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,361
Oh, God damn it.

452
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,485
Jesus!
Oh, shit!

453
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,523
This way. We're almost there!
We're so close!

454
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,801
Hey, you guys okay?

455
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,006
Are you guys okay?

456
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,924
There was a crazy earthquake.
Did you guys feel that?

457
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,411
That was insane.
Fuck, no.

458
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,481
We can't feel anything in here.

459
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,244
This place is
a fucking fortress.

460
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,084
That wasn't an earthquake, man.

461
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,804
That was something way
fucking crazier. No...

462
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,881
What's crazier
than an earthquake?

463
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,407
There were beams of blue
light coming out of the sky

464
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,006
and people getting
sucked up into the sky.

465
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,287
He's on hallucinogens.

466
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,081
Come on, guys. Don't bully Jay.
He's a sweetheart.

467
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,880
Keep going, man. What
are you talking about?

468
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,081
There were people,
and they were there,

469
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,766
and they got
sucked up into the sky.

470
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,649
Jay.
Sucked up into the sky?

471
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,290
Nobody got sucked up in here.

472
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,362
I got sucked off here.

473
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,805
No, okay, ask Seth.
He was...

474
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,006
You were there.
Tell them.

475
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,481
Seth, what the fuck's
he talking about?

476
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,164
I have no idea what he's
talking about honestly.

477
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,005
Did anybody get
sucked up into the sky?

478
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,161
I didn't see anything.

479
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,645
I don't know what
he's talking about.

480
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,290
You were there with me.
What are you saying?

481
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,360
All those people that were in the store
with us, they just fucking vanished.

482
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,164
I didn't see blue light
sucking people up in the sky.

483
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,641
You sound crazy, man. We
should just be lucky we're...

484
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,767
It's not over!

485
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,001
It's okay. Just relax.

486
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,650
Everyone, it's all right. Just a little tremor.
Party's still going.

487
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,802
In-N-Out truck's
coming in 10 minutes.

488
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,849
- Yes.
- Animal style!

489
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,610
Oh, my fuck!

490
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,529
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
- Move! Move!

491
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,807
Move, move, move, move!
This place is safe!

492
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,644
This place is not safe!

493
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,006
Craig, where you going, man?

494
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,889
It's a fucking earthquake! Fuck!

495
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,809
Move, move, move, come on! Get
out of my way. Move, girl!

496
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,082
- Oh, my God, Seth!
- Oh, shit!

497
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,571
Seth.
What the fuck?

498
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,002
Don't go on the grass,
not everybody on the grass!

499
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,045
What the fuck?

500
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,610
Oh, God!

501
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,244
What the fuck is happening?
Paul!

502
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,731
What's happening?

503
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,531
All right, everybody,
listen up. Listen up.

504
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,285
Who took my fucking
cell phone, man?

505
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,931
Martin, empty your pockets!
What?

506
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,441
I saw you in the bathroom, man!
Somebody dial my phone!

507
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,363
Shut the fuck up!
It's unbelievable!

508
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,728
It's unacceptable after all the
coke I've wasted on you people.

509
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,887
I've thrown it away.

510
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,246
I didn't take your
fucking cell phone.

511
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,443
310... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mike,
Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike...

512
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,446
My face!

513
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,761
What's happening to me?
What's happening?

514
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,205
Oh, my God!

515
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,929
Oh, shit, that's embarrassing.

516
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,321
Rihanna!

517
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,127
Please give me your foot!

518
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,611
Oh, my God!

519
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,204
Craig, Craig, help me.
I'm losing my grip!

520
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,645
It's too late for you!
You're already in the hole!

521
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,767
What the fuck
are you talking about?

522
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,921
Get the fuck out of my way!

523
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,846
Oh!

524
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,921
Sorry.

525
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,611
Karen!

526
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,365
Seth, come on! Get in the house!
Come on, Seth!

527
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,682
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!

528
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,165
Martin!

529
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,447
Oh, shit!
Kevin! Kevin!

530
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,567
What the fuck?

531
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,330
Geez, get the fuck
off me, Aziz!

532
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,688
Ow, ow, ow!

533
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,011
Fuck you, Kevin!

534
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,287
Oh, God, no, get your
fucking hands off me!

535
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,646
Get your fucking...

536
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,322
No!

537
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,482
Jay, I can't hold on
much longer.

538
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,484
You have to reach out
and grab me. You hear?

539
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,281
Okay, uh, you take my hand,
and I will swing you up.

540
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,010
Are you sure? I'm gonna
give you my whole weight.

541
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,485
I'm gonna reach for you, all right?
Yeah, yeah.

542
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,324
Are you sure you can do that?

543
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,640
I can grab you on three.

544
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,330
One, two, three.

545
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,601
All right, buddy.

546
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,682
Now I'm gonna,
I'm gonna swing across.

547
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,807
I got you, buddy.

548
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,400
You're gonna hold
my weight, all of it.

549
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,441
Okay, come on.

550
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,522
You can hold on to my full weight?
I can do it.

551
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
I don't want to die.
Okay.

552
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,324
One, two...
Two, three.

553
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,040
No!

554
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,083
No! No!

555
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,164
Oh, man.

556
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,126
Fuck.

557
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,606
Holy shit!
What happened?

558
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,250
Jay, you're alive.
Jay.

559
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,685
Oh, thank God, Jay.
I'm not dead yet.

560
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,285
I told you guys
not to go outside.

561
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,407
What just happened?

562
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,845
Jesus Christ, they are
all fucking dead.

563
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,490
I told you guys
not to run outside.

564
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,561
You all right?

565
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,563
I tried to save Aziz.
I tried.

566
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,449
You did your best, man.
I love you.

567
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,807
Why the fuck did you
guys run out there?

568
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,445
You know what, James,
can you lower your voice?

569
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,726
You're freaking out Jay!

570
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,649
Maybe I'm a little
freaked out, too!

571
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,285
- He's not as strong as you.
- They all fell in.

572
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,528
- Look at my house!
- I tried to save them. They all fell in.

573
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,251
Get your fucking hands off me.
Jonah, stop touching me.

574
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,890
Can we get Jay
some water, please?

575
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,166
Can we get him some hydration?

576
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,690
- He needs to be hydrated.
- The water's not working!

577
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,250
Everyone just
runs out the door!

578
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,606
My phone is dead.

579
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,364
Guys, the fucking
internet's not working!

580
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,329
Let's watch the TV.
Let's check the news.

581
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,164
Where is the TV?

582
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,282
It's in the floor.
In the floor?

583
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,089
- Oh, that's dope.
- Yeah, cool, huh?

584
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,201
That's really neat.

585
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,691
That is impressive, James.

586
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,882
<i>The biggest earthquake
to ever hit Les...</i>

587
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,770
<i>Officers urging people to stay
in their homes right now.</i>

588
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,842
<i>And also reports of
looting and rioting</i>

589
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,961
<i>are spreading across the city.</i>

590
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,201
Riots.

591
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,645
<i>Police are pretty
much outnumbered</i>

592
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,802
<i>as people are
turning to one another.</i>

593
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,609
<i>Martial law has
now been declared.</i>

594
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,170
<i>Air Force One has gone down...</i>

595
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,210
Shit. It's gone, guys.

596
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,442
So I think we should...

597
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,643
I think we should probably
go back to your place, eh?

598
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,131
What are you
talking about, man?

599
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,409
No, no way.
I'm not leaving here.

600
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,848
I don't want to die
at James Franco's house.

601
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,805
You heard the TV.

602
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,566
The TV said stay here.
It said stay in your homes.

603
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,723
We need to stay here until they
start rescuing people, okay?

604
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,326
A huge earthquake happens.
Who do they rescue first?

605
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,811
- Actors.
- Famous people.

606
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,360
They'll get Clooney,
Sandra Bullock, me.

607
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,204
If there's room,
you guys'll come.

608
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,640
The point is, is that we're all
gonna get out of this first.

609
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,561
What the hell was that?

610
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,005
It's already going
crazy out there, guys.

611
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,323
We can't leave. I'm not leaving, okay?
I'm a victim.

612
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,244
I've had a victim's mentality my whole life.
People can smell it on me.

613
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,163
When I was a kid,
I had man-titties.

614
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,924
The bullies held me down,
they tittie-fucked me.

615
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,331
That's what's happening
out there right now.

616
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,680
That's right, we are all soft.

617
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,886
Yeah.
We are all soft!

618
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,928
We are actors! We pretend
to be hard, man.

619
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,843
Yeah.
We soft as baby shit.

620
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,526
As baby shit, soft as... Wait,
Craig, what are you doing, man?

621
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,080
Hey, hey, what are you doing? What
are you doing to the painting, man?

622
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,804
We got to board this shit up, man.
Board it up?

623
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,325
We got to protect ourselves.
We don't know

624
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,124
how long we gonna be in here.
Okay, chill.

625
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,406
There's raccoons, and
bandits, and shit out there.

626
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,970
This is <i>Obey,</i> man!
If you get out the way!

627
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,361
This is my favorite fucking painting!
What are you doing, Craig?

628
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,441
Guys, help.

629
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,363
Help. Help. Get off.

630
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,046
Chill. Look.

631
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,929
Helicopter!
Helicopter!

632
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,046
The good guys are here. We're fine!
It's gonna be fine.

633
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,770
God damn!

634
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,763
Oh! God damn!

635
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,605
Ow! Shit!

636
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,681
You Okay?

637
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,091
No, I'm not okay!

638
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,288
Fuck your house, Franco!

639
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,641
My house didn't do that! Aah!

640
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,920
Ow.

641
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,130
You don't got a tool kit or nothing?
Just a toolbox?

642
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,565
I don't know.
Look in there.

643
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,129
Where's the edge of this shit?

644
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,328
Your thumb's
in my butthole, man.

645
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,846
Whoa.

646
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,570
Y'all need this dick?

647
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,681
No, we're not using it.

648
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,280
All right, I'm gonna
take it over here.

649
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,687
Careful with that dick.
Damn.

650
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,365
It's heavy.

651
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,163
There it is, got that dick now.

652
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,686
That dick is coming now.

653
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,521
Yeah, got this big dick.

654
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,165
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey.

655
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,810
What now?
Listen.

656
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,929
Not the Rogen, all right?
Don't take him.

657
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,087
Take me.

658
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,607
We got 12 bottles of water,
56 beers, two vodkas,

659
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,809
four whiskeys, six bottles
of wine, tequila, Nutella,

660
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,566
cheese, pizza, eggs, bananas,
apples, bacon, steaks,

661
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,565
pancake mix, CT Crunch,
milk, ketchup, a Milky Way,

662
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,729
half ounce Sour Diesel, three and
a half grams Grand Master Kush,

663
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,962
one ounce of 'shrooms,
15 pills of ecstasy,

664
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,042
a porno mag, a baseball bat,

665
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,487
and the video camera
from the movie <i>27 Hours.</i>

666
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,050
<i>127 Hours.</i>

667
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,805
Uh...

668
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,689
<i>127 Hours.</i>

669
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,969
And a functioning revolver
from the movie <i>Flyboys.</i>

670
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,451
Old Faithful.

671
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,851
Jesus.
Thing's real.

672
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,729
No, I kept this from the movie.
Yeah.

673
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,370
This is an actual revolver.
I see.

674
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,487
Franco, that's
very uncomfortable.

675
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,607
Could you put
that down, please?

676
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,647
Loaded.

677
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,131
Love it.
Awesome.

678
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,924
Can you just put the gun away?
I always keep my props.

679
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,048
That's really cool.
Always keep my props.

680
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,201
I know how to handle it.

681
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,805
He knows what he's doing.
I like this bit.

682
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,291
I like it. I get it. Let me see.

683
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,328
It's real. It's heavy.
Let me see it like that.

684
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,004
- God damn!
- Come on, guys!

685
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,161
- You could kill...
- Careful.

686
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,321
- Bang, bang!
- Jesus!

687
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,731
Please, put it down!
Oh, fuck!

688
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,848
Bang, bang, bang.
You're dead.

689
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,008
I hope you're fucking happy.
Pow, pow, pow.

690
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,764
Stop... Guys, stop
fucking with the gun.

691
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,365
Jesus! Jesus!
Pow, pow.

692
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,441
It's a real gun!
Bang.

693
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,521
It's so funny.
It's so funny.

694
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,080
- Guys, it's funny.
- It's not funny!

695
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,531
We're getting sidetracked.

696
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,886
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

697
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,371
- I'll just kill myself.
- No!

698
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,601
- Don't do that, Jonah!
- Jesus.

699
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,681
Oh, no.
Jonah, give it back.

700
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,400
I don't know! I don't know.
Don't do that.

701
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,204
Jonah.
I'm so...

702
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,044
- Oh, my God. Hey.
- Oh, dude.

703
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,610
Come on, no, no.
Don't. Jesus!

704
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,210
Would you put the thing down?
The whole...

705
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,566
I'm trying to
have some fun, man.

706
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,324
Okay, okay, Jesus.

707
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,562
Look, just because a bunch
of people fell into a hole outside

708
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,040
doesn't mean we can't
have some fun.

709
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,731
We're a bunch of best friends hanging out.
It's like a sleepover.

710
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,167
Okay, food. How are we
gonna deal with this?

711
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,047
Um...

712
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,326
Can I have that Milky Way?

713
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,845
No, you can't have
the Milky Way.

714
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,086
That's my Milky Way.
There's a bunch... What?

715
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,571
I went out this morning,

716
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,723
specifically bought this Milky
Way to eat after my party.

717
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,801
That's weird.

718
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,325
It's not weird.
It's my special food.

719
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,050
I like it. Back me
up on that, Seth.

720
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,406
I don't think you should get
the whole Milky Way.

721
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,527
I want some of the Milky Way.

722
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,331
I'd be pretty bummed if I don't at
least get a bite of the Milky Way.

723
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,447
Oh! Now Craig wants
a bite of the Milky Way.

724
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah, I want a bite of the Milky Way.
It's a fucking Milky Way.

725
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,725
A fifth of everything is
what's fair and reasonable.

726
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,609
Everyone gets
a fifth of everything.

727
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,250
I want one-fifth
of your T-shirt!

728
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,084
I want the bottom part,
the belly.

729
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,605
I'm not sporting
a crop top in your house.

730
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,250
I'll cut that shit off
and make a headband.

731
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,049
You couldn't handle my midriff.

732
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,964
Guys, the only issue is,
I kind of need the Milky Way.

733
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,201
For fuck's sake.

734
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,611
No, for real,
I have low blood sugar,

735
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,681
and if my endorphins
drop too low,

736
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,761
I'm gonna be
a nightmare to be around.

737
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,763
What? Your LBS starts acting up,

738
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,808
you can have a finger
scoop of Nutella, okay?

739
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,281
One finger scoop of Nutella.
Fair.

740
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,004
I'm going to bed.

741
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,525
Jesus fucking...

742
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,170
Don't touch that
Milky Way, Jonah.

743
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,566
Night, James.

744
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,931
Oh, God, no!

745
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,091
Fuck.

746
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,326
Hey.
Hey.

747
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,245
I'm gonna sleep with you.

748
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,645
What? I'm gonna sleep with you.

749
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,767
It's too scary to sleep alone.

750
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,880
But this is my little area.

751
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,570
Well, I'm invading
your little area.

752
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,564
I'm sorry, but I'm
too scared, okay?

753
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,641
Are you mad at me, man?

754
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,484
If I was pissed at you,

755
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,801
I'm sure it would
have something to do

756
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,490
with the fact that
I had no interest

757
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,564
in coming to
this house socially,

758
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,484
and now,
I am barricaded in here

759
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,530
with a bunch of people
that I really hate.

760
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,684
Maybe this was meant to be.

761
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,003
Maybe this horrible, horrible,
deadly earthquake happened

762
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,367
so we could become closer
as a group of friends.

763
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,041
I don't need a group. I'm like DMX, man.
I'm a lone wolf.

764
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,610
DMX isn't a lone wolf.

765
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,769
DMX has the Ruff Ryder crew.

766
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,127
You can't stop, drop,
and open up shop alone.

767
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,370
You need people to help you in an
earthquake disastery situation.

768
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,365
It was something else.
It was Judgment Day.

769
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,805
Like <i>Terminator 2?</i>

770
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,167
No, not like <i>Terminator 2.</i>
For God's sakes.

771
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,049
Like Skynet?
You think this is Skynet?

772
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,360
Like, Skynet went live?
No.

773
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,204
Will you please
stop saying "Skynet"?

774
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,408
Well, you're the one
that said Judgment Day.

775
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,084
The biblical Judgment Day.

776
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,209
What? That's crazy. It's just...

777
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,486
You fucking heathen.

778
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,601
Okay, here's the thing.

779
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,921
Let's say for a second
there was blue light

780
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,570
sucking people up into the sky.

781
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,122
That means that we were not
awesome enough to go to heaven.

782
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,562
Shit! Shit.

783
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,084
What y'all doing?

784
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,926
Fuck you, Craig.

785
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,843
I'm scared.
It's scary by myself.

786
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,570
It's way better
with more people.

787
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,007
I'm gonna come down here.

788
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,526
Oh, yeah, good, yeah.
Get in here, man.

789
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,567
Get right in there.

790
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,244
So, you're gonna...

791
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,731
Right here.
Right here.

792
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,446
I feel better, actually.
I like that.

793
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,844
It's better with more people.

794
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,921
Hey, guys...

795
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,082
- Jesus Christ.
- Jesus!

796
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,640
Sorry. Franco has this
crazy open floor plan.

797
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,643
I can hear every word
you guys are saying.

798
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,041
I might as well hang with
you guys if that's cool.

799
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,770
Nice.
Coming in hot.

800
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,444
I gonna grab
a blanket from you.

801
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,851
Give me that blanket.

802
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,684
Get in the middle of it.
That's good.

803
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,001
That's it. It feels so
much more safe now, guys.

804
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,241
It's nice here.

805
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,685
Should we spoon it?
Yeah, you want to?

806
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,886
No!
Want to go...

807
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,961
Dick to butt?
No.

808
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,161
My butt to you and then Jay.

809
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,043
I don't want to butt
to dick to anything.

810
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,360
Are you docking into me?
You're doing tip to me?

811
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,441
Or what are you doing?

812
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,601
Should we go butt to
butt or dick to...

813
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,681
Seth and I are
gonna go ass to ass.

814
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,966
Do you want to go
front to front?

815
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,122
No, I'm fine
just going dicks up.

816
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,281
Dicks up?

817
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,850
I think I'm going dick to ass.
You know what?

818
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,968
I'm going
<i>Scarface</i>-style.

819
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,280
Both of you guys.
Wait, yeah.

820
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,521
There we go.
Yeah.

821
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,647
This is the best way.

822
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,801
Good night, boys.

823
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,247
Good night.
Good night.

824
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,560
Good night, guys.

825
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,369
Night, my sweet guys.
Good night.

826
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,601

Franco!
Good morning, sunshine.

843
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,960
Guys! Guys! Wake up!

844
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,850
Danny's alive! He's eating
all the fucking food!

845
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,888
No!
Danny, man, don't.

846
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,806
Danny!

847
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,927
No, it's cool, man. I fucking
made this for you guys.

848
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,001
Stop eating!

849
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,206
Don't eat another
piece of bacon.

850
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,406
Guys, just chill
the fuck out, okay?

851
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,450
I'm sure the Green Goblin can
fucking afford some more bacon.

852
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,807
Dude, that shit's supposed to
last us till we get rescued!

853
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,329
Wait a second.
I know what happened.

854
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,006
You guys dropped acid,
didn't you? Mmm-hmm.

855
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,320
Craig doesn't have any pants on.
He got fucking wild.

856
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,806
Probably danced, sweated
all over the place.

857
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,166
You got white shit all
over your mouth, Franco.

858
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,526
You probably sucked
somebody's dick.

859
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,410
Jonah over here probably
watched and jerked off.

860
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,642
Jay, I didn't even know you were in town.
Good to see you.

861
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,087
Danny, we're not on acid. We
didn't suck each other's dicks!

862
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,891
James Franco didn't suck
any dick last night?

863
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,530
Now I know y'all are tripping.

864
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,443
You actually not know
what happened last night?

865
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,091
Daniel, you may want to
stay seated for a second.

866
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,049
Some really
messed-up stuff happened,

867
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,361
and there were
a lot of fatalities.

868
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,125
Oh, really? You're putting
your serious voice on, Jonah?

869
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,601
Okay, tell me about
these "fatalities."

870
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,763
Dude, Segel's dead, Krumholtz
is dead, Michael Cera's dead.

871
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,526
Guess if Michael Cera's gone, it's
not a total loss, huh?

872
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,125
Jesus, Danny.
Michael Cera's dead.

873
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,929
What?
It's not like that.

874
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,684
It's not funny, man.
It's really not funny.

875
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,801
Seth, that's
a better performance

876
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,450
than you've given in
your last six movies.

877
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,280
Where the fuck was that
in Green Hornet, huh?

878
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,163
Jonah, you're fucking
sucking balls.

879
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,844
You're an Academy Award
nominated person.

880
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,287
You need to be fucking
selling that shit, dude.

881
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,561
"Fatalities.
There were some fatalities."

882
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,167
Fatalities.

883
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,724
Okay, now that was good.
That was good.

884
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,802
Does it seem like
we're fucking joking?

885
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,451
Hey, hey, hey! What the
fuck you eating, man?

886
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,370
Spit it out your mouth. Give me the bacon!

887
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,040
Shit.

888
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,211
Shit, what do we do?

889
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,123
Shoot 'em!
Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em!

890
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,127
Should I shoot?

891
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,288
- Shut up, Franco!
- Shoot the door, Franco!

892
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,007
Oh, God!

893
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,686
Did you not hear me knocking out here?
I've been knocking forever.

894
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,649
Please! Please!
You've got to let me in!

895
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,842
Hang on a second.
What?

896
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,400
Guys, I know
it sounds really weird,

897
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,926
but I don't think
we should let him in.

898
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,167
Why not?

899
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,969
Yeah, why not? I can
hear you, by the way.

900
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,690
I'm sorry. We just
don't know you, man.

901
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,207
You could be like, a looter, or
a rapist, or a tittie-fucker.

902
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,611
Like, I'm sorry.

903
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,524
Look, guys, we just boarded up this
whole house to keep everyone out,

904
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,171
and the first guy comes to the
door, we're gonna let him in?

905
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,765
I mean, how do we know
we can trust this guy?

906
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,605
I want to live! Things
have gone crazy out here!

907
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,923
"Fucking crazy
out here!" This guy fucking sucks.

908
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,047
What if he's the rapist?

909
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,246
Man, even if he is a rapist,

910
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,129
he can't rape all of us.
Yeah! No! So I'm not...

911
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,804
I'm not a rapist! You
want to tittie-fuck us?

912
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,645
If you want me to tittie-fuck you, I will!
So good! You'll love it.

913
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,006
Seth, back me up, please.

914
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,401
We can't just leave him out there to die.
Are you crazy?

915
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,488
What do you want to do? I'll
do whatever you want to do.

916
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,641
Let's vote on it.

917
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,529
Yeah, I fucking
vote you let me in.

918
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,045
Here's my vote.
Fuck all of you.

919
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,610
I'm letting him in.
This is boring.

920
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,561
There's something out here!

921
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,722
This is real!
This is fucking real!

922
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,561
God damn it!

923
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,845
You guys!

924
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,360
This man was alive
a few seconds ago.

925
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,925
We can't play soccer
with his head!

926
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,365
Pick it up, Jonah!

927
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,411
What the fuck is going on?

928
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,090
He blinked at me.

929
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,288
He blinked at my face.
Seth, put it over there.

930
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,886
Oh, my God!

931
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,200
I got it.
I got it, guys.

932
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,687
There's blood
all over my floor!

933
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,091
Time to relax for a second.

934
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,965
Okay, someone should
look out the hole.

935
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,121
I ain't looking out that hole!

936
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,248
Last person looked through that
hole got his head chopped off!

937
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,530
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Whatever is
out there might still be out there.

938
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,920
Okay, I know, I know.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

939
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,049
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

940
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,364
There's a lookout!

941
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,328
Jesus Christ! Look, there's a
huge fucking hole down there!

942
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,209
What the fuck is this?

943
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,360
Where's the thing
that killed the guy?

944
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,481
I don't know.

945
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,721
How'd his head fall off?

946
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,040
And where's the rest of him?

947
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,886
<i>Hi.</i>

948
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,644
<i>This is James Franco,</i>

949
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,840
<i>in my house, in my library.</i>

950
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,362
<i>We've been stuck here
for about 24 hours.</i>

951
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,841
<i>Danny McBride is here.</i>

952
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,360
<i>I didn't even
invite him to my party,</i>

953
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,006
<i>but he came and passed
out in the bathtub,</i>

954
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,163
<i>and I got to say it's, like,
typical fucking McBride.</i>

955
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,370
<i>Like, I've been feeling really
weird about him lately.</i>

956
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,444
<i>Like, I don't really know if I
want to be friends with him,</i>

957
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,366
<i>and then he fucking
showed up at my party,</i>

958
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,048
<i>and now, we're stuck here with
him in disaster lockdown, so...</i>

959
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,566
<i>What up?
What's going on?</i>

960
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,051
<i>Hey, Danny.
What's up, man?</i>

961
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,640
<i>Not much. What are you doing'?
What is this?</i>

962
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,200
<i>Oh, it's just
a video confessional.</i>

963
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,285
<i>Fuck that dude.</i>

964
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,804
- Earthquakes cause tsunamis.
- Yes.

965
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,281
Tsunamis cause
other tsunamis, disaster.

966
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,362
I mean, for all we know, the fucking
Lakers could have just won,

967
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,851
and that's the reason
why all this is happening.

968
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,888
Hole in Franco's front yard?
Sinkhole.

969
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,328
Every single time I turn on the
news, sinkhole in South America.

970
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,044
Bunch of South Americans getting
sucked into the ground.

971
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,565
Sinkhole de Mayo.
Sinkhole de Mayo.

972
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,721
That's why it's named that,

973
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,364
because sinkholes happen
in the summertime.

974
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,445
It's not wildfires. It's not earthquakes.
It's not sinkholes.

975
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,646
I think I know what it is.

976
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,721
Let's hear it.

977
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,927
I think it's the Apocalypse.

978
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,480
What?

979
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,369
I'm serious, boys. It's all in
here, in the Book of Revelations.

980
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,407
You took my Bible?

981
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,481
Well, just hear me out,

982
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,800
and you tell me that
what I'm describing

983
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,645
isn't what's going on right now.

984
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,408
"And the skies shall open up, and the
light of the Lord shall shine down,"

985
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,245
"and those of good heart shall be
brought into my kingdom of heaven."

986
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,723
That's the Rapture, those are the
gigantic beams of blue light.

987
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,121
"And there will be a great
mountain burning in fire."

988
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,647
I mean, the Hollywood Hills are
literally engulfed in flames

989
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,131
as we sit here right now.

990
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,771
The Hollywood Hills ain't no mountain.
It's a hill.

991
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,046
Takes about 10 minutes
to get across

992
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,281
that motherfucker
with no traffic.

993
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,600
Coldwater.
I take Laurel Canyon.

994
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,607
Cahuenga.
Cahuenga.

995
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,569
I usually zip down Barham. Boys,
can I just fucking finish?

996
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,926
I love Laurel Canyon.

997
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,840
"And out of the pit rose a great
red dragon having seven heads,"

998
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,691
"that old serpent
called the devil and Satan,"

999
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,650
"which deceiveth
the whole world,"

1000
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,291
"was released
onto the earth."

1001
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,561
I love that dude. He's from
<i>Where the Wild Things Are.</i>

1002
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,681
It's a load of bullshit.

1003
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,807
It's not bullshit.

1004
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,166
Want to know
something else, Jay?

1005
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,321
If this is
the end of the world,

1006
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,004
and all the good people died,

1007
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,290
what you're saying is Seth,
me, Jonah, Craig and Danny

1008
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,401
are a bunch of assholes.

1009
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,642
I'm straight-up
lovable, son.

1010
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,486
And if this really
is the Apocalypse,

1011
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,607
you're here, too.

1012
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,562
So, that means you're just
as shitty as the rest of us.

1013
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,771
Doesn't feel too good, does it?

1014
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,846
Hey, guys.
I'm going to sleep now.

1015
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,285
Nobody come in here
and bother me.

1016
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,921
Go fish.

1017
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,684
Put it back inside of here.

1018
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,683
Do you know what it is? Yeah.

1019
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,967
Now you ask me for
something that you need.

1020
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,451
First bit.

1021
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,846
You're not cutting it all?

1022
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,651
That's smart. You're
divvying it up first.

1023
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,763
This is like, Fruyere or some shit.
That's me.

1024
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,887
Come on, Danny!

1025
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,360
You licked your finger.
Come on, man.

1026
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,531
If they're all
equal, what does it matter?

1027
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,965
Keep your hands
and fingers off.

1028
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,007
Seth?
Yeah.

1029
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,809
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, yeah.

1030
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,291
Yeah, no shit.

1031
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,167
Here.
Off the menu, my man.

1032
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,522
Holy shit, man.
Where did you get these?

1033
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,127
Hey, what's cheese without a few crackers?
Know what I'm saying?

1034
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,089
Hide it.
Okay.

1035
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,725
'Cause we're a team.

1036
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,881
Okay.

1037
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,849
Freaks forever, brother.

1038
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,128
Let's do all the drugs.

1039
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,043
I don't really want to.

1040
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,761
Should have thought of that before
you drank a can full of ecstasy.

1041
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,641

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,007
You're actually alive.
Thank God!

1087
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,845
I hid in a drainpipe for days.

1088
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,810
Like, three or four.
I don't even know how many.

1089
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,370
And then I stopped
hearing people,

1090
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,124
and I started hearing
growling noises.

1091
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,602
Out there, in your travels, uh,

1092
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,966
did you see anything
that you would describe

1093
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,565
as Apocalyptish?

1094
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,369
I mean, no,

1095
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,247
but, uh, I would say it's completely
obvious what's going on here.

1096
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,886
I mean, it's a zombie invasion.

1097
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,610
Fuck! DANNY: I'm the one who
said it's been zombies.

1098
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,449
You said zombies? I said
zombies the whole time.

1099
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,841
You said zombies? I don't think...
You never said zombies.

1100
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,928
Wait a second. You guys
haven't been proven right.

1101
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,240
These are still just theories.

1102
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,891
Honestly, I'm just so relieved
that you guys are here,

1103
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,009
and I'm very happy about the
idea of sleeping and just...

1104
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,081
You tired?
Yeah.

1105
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,925
If you want to
take a little rest,

1106
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,002
you're welcome to
do that upstairs.

1107
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,366
Thank you.
Cool.

1108
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,010
- I'll show you the way.
- Thank you.

1109
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,003
Thanks, guys. Seriously,
you're awesome, really.

1110
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,650
You're awesome.

1111
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,486
So fucking tight.

1112
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,841
We'll be right out here, okay?

1113
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,401
Fuck are you
guys doing out here?

1114
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,727
Here's what I think we should do.
She's British, right?

1115
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,529
She's used to eating
shitty food anyway.

1116
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,489
Let's just give her all the
shitty food that we don't want.

1117
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,085
That's fucked up.
Look how tiny she is.

1118
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,083
She's not even a full seven.
She's, like, halfa seven.

1119
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,481
This is a fucking
cool thing, man.

1120
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,851
I, for one, am very excited.

1121
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,763
I'm a massive <i>Harry Potter</i> fan.

1122
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,922
What? Yes. I love
fucking <i>Harry Potter.</i>

1123
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,445
I cannot wait till she wakes up

1124
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,204
and I can ask her all these
amazing questions about

1125
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,486
how they made
those motion pictures.

1126
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,607
Take it easy, Dumbledore.

1127
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,570
Guys, listen, listen.
I think we need to

1128
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,369
address the elephant
in the room.

1129
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,204
Whoa. Jay, don't talk
about Craig like that.

1130
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,850
That's fucked up. I'm
right here, man. Yeah.

1131
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,048
I'm not calling
Craig an elephant.

1132
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,160
Wow, that's fucking weird.
What does that even mean?

1133
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,440
Yeah, no.
That's racist.

1134
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,646
I wasn't referring to him.

1135
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,122
I was referring to the issue
that's on all of our minds.

1136
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,486
What?

1137
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,882
This is one girl
in a house with six males.

1138
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,121
Yeah. Really safe.

1139
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,326
Ideal scenario.

1140
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,481
She's like a little sister.

1141
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,005
I think that she needs...

1142
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,809
It's important
that she feels safe.

1143
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,370
Yeah.
And comfortable.

1144
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,805
And we should be mindful.

1145
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,211
Who's making her not feel safe?

1146
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,725
Well, I'm just saying,
we should...

1147
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,167
We don't want to
give off a bad vibe.

1148
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,765
Vibe? Vibes? I ain't
giving no vibes.

1149
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,490
Yeah, wait, what kind of vibes
are you talking about, man?

1150
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,449
He's talking about us
giving off a rapey vibe.

1151
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,124
- Hey! Shh!
- Whoa! What?

1152
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,049
Jesus. Jay, what the fuck, man?

1153
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,281
Chill out, dude.

1154
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,249
Why you putting that
shit in the mix? Yeah.

1155
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,084
He fucking said it.
You're the one saying it.

1156
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,571
No one here is thinking
about raping anyone.

1157
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,290
Shh! Well, you
talking about vibes

1158
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,204
is the only thing that's
rapey going on right now.

1159
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,203
Dude, nothing was rapey till you
brought up the rapey vibes.

1160
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,282
Fucking one who smelt it dealt it, dawg.
True that, dude.

1161
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,771
One who denies it supplies it.

1162
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,842
I know, it's farts, I get it.

1163
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,081
Guys, guys, guys.

1164
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,764
Jay's not rapey.

1165
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,281
Jay couldn't rape a fly.

1166
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,089
He probably could.

1167
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,043
Maybe we should just stop this
entire conversation right now.

1168
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,844
If anyone's gonna
rape anyone here,

1169
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,251
it's probably gonna be Danny.

1170
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,731
What the fuck, Franco?
What?

1171
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,211
Why do you think
I'm gonna rape somebody?

1172
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,169
I'm just trying
to lay it out there.

1173
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,605
I'm not gonna
rape anyone, all right?

1174
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,966
If anyone's gonna
rape somebody, it's Jay.

1175
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,604
What? He came
up with the rape idea.

1176
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,886
And his face looks
like the police sketch

1177
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,120
- of a fucking rapist.
- True.

1178
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,366
What the fuck does that mean?

1179
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,044
If anybody's
raping Emma Watson,

1180
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,246
it's fucking Sir
Rapes-a-Lot over here.

1181
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,441
- Chill out.
- Hey!

1182
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,806
Whoa!

1183
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,881
Easy. Easy.

1184
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,041
Back the fuck up!

1185
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,406
Emma.
What's wrong?

1186
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,561
Wait, what's wrong?
What's wrong?

1187
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,766
I just heard
you guys talking about

1188
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,330
which one of you is
gonna get to rape me.

1189
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,811
No, no, no, no!

1190
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,325
Guys, I got it.
I got it.

1191
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,681
No. It's funny.
It's funny.

1192
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,720
We were specifically talking
about not raping you.

1193
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,086
Jesus!
Holy shit!

1194
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,924
Back up!

1195
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,970
It's me, Jonah!

1196
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,530
It's me, Jonah Hill.

1197
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,171
America's sweetheart.
J-bug, J-bone.

1198
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,081
Your friend. I would never hurt you.
Get back!

1199
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,722
Give me everything you have to drink!
Put it in the bag!

1200
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,609
There's six of us.
You cannot rob us!

1201
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,920
I'm not fucking around!

1202
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,690
Give her drinks!
Give her drinks!

1203
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,165
Put the drinks in a bag!

1204
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,282
Oh, God. Get all the
drinks in a bag!

1205
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,691
Hurry the fuck up!

1206
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,966
Okay, they're getting
the drinks.

1207
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,088
Put the ax down. Don't
give the Milky Way away.

1208
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,083
All right, you can
put the ax down now.

1209
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,241
Now, Franco!
Shoot her face!

1210
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,446
Shoot her!

1211
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,090
I'm not gonna
shoot Emma Watson!

1212
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,810
Look, Emma, just
stay here with us.

1213
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,530
It's a lot safer
than out there.

1214
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,120
<i>Hermione just stole
all of our shit.</i>

1215
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,886
<i>Little bitty-ass
20-year-old jacked us.</i>

1216
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,282
<i>And then Jay suggested that we
all rape her, and now she's gone.</i>

1217
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,681
<i>I didn't...
I was just... I...</i>

1218
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,889
<i>I think the only reason why he
did that is because Jay knows</i>

1219
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,371
<i>he's about fucking
two minutes away</i>

1220
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,044
<i>from becoming
the house bitch himself.</i>

1221
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,045
<i>So now,
motherfuckers is thirsty.</i>

1222
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,129
All right, guys.

1223
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,964
The door to the
basement's out there,

1224
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,451
around the side of the house.

1225
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,848
I know for sure there's at
least two jugs of water.

1226
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,410
Okay.

1227
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,481
Uh...

1228
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,646
Any volunteers?

1229
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,521
Does anyone want to
volunteer and go with Jay?

1230
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,647
What?

1231
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,643
I thought you said, "Someone
volunteer to go with me out there."

1232
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,721
I must have misheard you.

1233
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,763
I'm sorry. You did
not, you motherfucker.

1234
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,251
Hey, okay, ease up.

1235
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,891
Just chill out, dude.
Just relax, man. God.

1236
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,803
So how we gonna
decide this, fellas?

1237
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,281
All right, guys, it's simple.

1238
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,762
Whoever pulls the burnt match
has to go get the water.

1239
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,924
Who wants to go first?

1240
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,200
I'll do it.

1241
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,406
Craig.

1242
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,090
All right.

1243
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,525
Go ahead, brother.

1244
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,771
No whammies, no whammies.

1245
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,605
- Hey, hey.
- Yes! Yeah!

1246
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,523
Yes!

1247
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,768
- Whoo!
- Fuck, yes. Fuck, yes.

1248
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,888
- So sorry, Craig.
- A lot of guys in here

1249
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,321
that I wish it was
instead of you.

1250
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,484
You want to go
best two out of three?

1251
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,087
If I tug, if I pull in anyway,
or if you hear me screaming,

1252
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,561
anything, you pull me
right back in, all right?

1253
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,483
Yeah. We'll try, man,
but you're pretty heavy.

1254
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,281
What?

1255
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,125
No, I mean, I'm saying,
I just don't think it's smart

1256
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,645
to make any guarantees.
Fuck, no.

1257
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,404
You promise to pull me back in.
No, no, we're...

1258
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,641
You got me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1259
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,045
We're gonna do our best.
All right.

1260
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,724
You want to do a test run? Yeah.

1261
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,401
You gotta scream.
Let us hear the scream.

1262
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,090
Pull.

1263
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,605
Nice. Very nice.

1264
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,806
Everyone thank Craig
for doing this.

1265
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,644
Thanks, Craig.
Thank you, Craig.

1266
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,721
Go for it, Craig.

1267
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,802
Getting smoky in here.
Go, go, go, go.

1268
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,169
This is fucked up.

1269
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,683
Goddamn.

1270
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,762
Smoky as fuck out here.

1271
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,727
Rope burn!
Ah! Ooh!

1272
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,484
Grab it, grab it, grab it!

1273
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,800
Oh, no, no, no, no!

1274
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,927
Shit.
Oh, no.

1275
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,042
Shit. Shit.

1276
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,006
Come on, motherfucker.
Shit!

1277
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,570
Fuck this shit.

1278
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,330
Fellas, fellas! Pull me in!
Pull the rope!

1279
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,010
Pull me in! We don't
have the rope anymore!

1280
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,441
We fucking dropped it!
We're sorry!

1281
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,641
You've got the rope, man!

1282
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,051
What?

1283
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,284
Craig! What the fuck do we do?

1284
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,124
Craig! Craig!

1285
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,881
Are you okay?

1286
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,007
What happened, man?

1287
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,720
I don't know! There's
something out there.

1288
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,601
Oh, shit!

1289
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,808
A knife!
Somebody throw me a knife!

1290
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,166
I'll get it.

1291
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,081
Why?

1292
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,685
Jay, I'm so sorry, bro.

1293
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,761
The fuck?

1294
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,120
Cut it! Cut it!
Cut it! Cut it! Cut it!

1295
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,966
God! What the fuck
was that?

1296
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,166
I don't know what
the fuck that was,

1297
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,406
but I ain't
going back out there.

1298
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,561
Craig, you didn't even
get any of the water.

1299
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,641
The door was fucked up.

1300
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,882
Damn it,
this is so frustrating!

1301
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,247
It's so close, but so far.

1302
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,403
The water, it's, like,
right underneath us.

1303
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,130
Like, right there.

1304
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,965
What do you mean
"right underneath us"?

1305
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,328
Like, literally,
like, right there.

1306
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,050
If you went right
through the floor.

1307
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,685
Yo.

1308
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:39,163
Danny and Jonah's shift ends in ten
minutes, so our break is almost over.

1309
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,171
Okay.

1310
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,640
Let me ask you something.

1311
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,640
You really think this is

1312
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,210
the Apocalypse?

1313
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,760
You saw something
out there, didn't you?

1314
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:56,290
All right, let's just say for
sake of argument, what if I did?

1315
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,488
What if this is the real
shit, right now, happening?

1316
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,960
What if it is, man? We're
not prepared for this.

1317
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,003
What do we do? What's next?
It says in the Bible,

1318
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,003
"The worthy will
ascend to Heaven."

1319
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,291
Even if it is the Apocalypse,
it's not the end of us.

1320
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,930
There's still hope.

1321
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,243
We just have to somehow try
to prove our worthiness.

1322
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,607
Okay, so, you mean, like,

1323
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,127
like the Ten Commandments,
like, do shit unto people

1324
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,440
that'll do
the same shit to you.

1325
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,249
That's a great place to start.

1326
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,731
You know, to just overall love.

1327
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,883
Just be nicer and follow
those commandments.

1328
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,281
Listen. We're gonna
get through this.

1329
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,681
We're gonna get
through this, man.

1330
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,405
You know why? 'Cause we're
gonna do it together.

1331
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,686
You promise?

1332
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,046
We're gonna do this.

1333
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,802
I hear everything.

1334
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,843
Who did this?

1335
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,285
Who did this?

1336
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,601
Did what? What are
you talking about?

1337
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,286
Jizzed all over the pages
of this nice magazine

1338
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,323
I was nice enough
to tell you about.

1339
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,050
Was it you, Seth?

1340
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,281
No.

1341
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,771
No?
It was me, Franco.

1342
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,968
I fucking made jizz
in your magazine.

1343
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,849
Why?
When I fucking jack off

1344
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,649
long enough,
I end up jizzing, dude.

1345
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,291
I'm assuming the same
shit works for you?

1346
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,011
Real fucking smart answer! Why
don't you fucking aim, huh?

1347
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,289
I have a particularly explosive ejaculate.
It just goes everywhere.

1348
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,249
It's like a fucking
wild fireman's hose.

1349
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,890
You just got to grab on
and pray to God

1350
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,291
it doesn't get in your
eyes or your mouth.

1351
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,010
The fuck kind of
jerking off is that?

1352
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,081
What, you never had
any brothers?

1353
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,766
You didn't learn to jizz in a fucking
sock or on a fucking tissue?

1354
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,604
No, I don't have any brothers.

1355
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,125
I was raised
in a house of women!

1356
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,964
I highly doubt
they fucking taught you

1357
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,691
to fucking close your eyes and
fucking cum wherever you want!

1358
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,807
I mean, you're getting
all worked up

1359
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,450
over a fucking porno mag!

1360
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,761
Who has goddamn
porno mags anymore?

1361
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,161
Welcome to the 21st
century, Buck Rogers!

1362
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,090
You designed a house with
fucking iPads in the walls,

1363
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,601
yet you're jerking your dick
like a goddamn pilgrim!

1364
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,206
That's right, man.
I like to fucking read!

1365
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,360
You think that's the only
thing I jerked off in here?

1366
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,360
I've been dropping loads
around this fucking house

1367
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,606
like a goddamn dump truck.

1368
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,170
You don't cum on my stuff!

1369
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,844
I'll cum wherever
the fuck I want, James.

1370
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,206
I'll fucking cum
in your kitchen.

1371
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,486
I'll cum on your fucking art.

1372
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,130
I'll cum anywhere I want!

1373
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,884
I will fucking cum
right on you!

1374
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,327
I will cum like a fucking
madman all over you, McBride!

1375
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,165
Ooh. I fucking wish you'd
cum on me right now.

1376
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,605
I fucking dare you
to cum on me!

1377
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,081
God!

1378
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,367
I'm gonna jack my dick
so fucking hard in here!

1379
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,006
This, no more, man.
All over your fucking face.

1380
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,128
This fucking all more.
All over the fucking place!

1381
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,850
I'll fucking cum
anywhere I want!

1382
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,251
I'll fucking cum
on these walls!

1383
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,810
I'll cum on
the fucking cabinets!

1384
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,450
On the fucking furniture!
I'll cum everywhere!

1385
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,284
If I see your dick
one more time,

1386
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,725
I'm gonna fucking shoot it off!

1387
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,609
You don't have
enough bullets, bitch.

1388
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,206
No fucking jerking off
in my house, McBride!

1389
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,969
Come on, man.
Fuck this.

1390
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,690
I'm just... I'm too
thirsty to do this.

1391
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,040
And the fucking bitter irony is

1392
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,287
I'm not gonna have my thirst
quenched until I finish this.

1393
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,885
God damn it, I hate it.
Danny, no.

1394
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,371
Don't walk away. Danny,
don't walk away from me!

1395
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,489
It's too late, Seth. I've
already walked away too much.

1396
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,329
No, you haven't. You
could still come back

1397
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,971
and just fucking turn around
and come back and help me.

1398
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,166
Danny?

1399
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,086
Daniel?

1400
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,691
Need a hand?

1401
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,566
Yeah, dude.

1402
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,607
Your shift just ended, man.

1403
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,091
You don't have to help me
if you don't want to.

1404
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,321
It's fine, I get it.

1405
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,164
The fuck else am I doing?

1406
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,368
I appreciate it, man.
Thank you.

1407
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,885
Done and done.
That's cool.

1408
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,771
I don't know why I'm thinking
of this, but remember that time

1409
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,640
that I got you a fucking
Taco Bell gift certificate

1410
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,404
for, like, 20 bucks,
and I bet you

1411
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,488
that you couldn't eat
all of that in one sitting.

1412
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,324
I do remember that.
I remember thinking,

1413
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,680
"How much food
could 20 dollars"

1414
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,085
"possibly buy you
at Taco Bell?"

1415
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,605
And the answer is infinite.

1416
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,682
And we went to see
fucking Gladiator.

1417
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,807
Yeah.

1418
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,326
And you sharted midway
through the movie.

1419
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,050
I did. Due to the
tigers' appearance.

1420
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,685
I got scared of the tigers.
Yeah.

1421
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,250
Literally, when the second
tiger came out, I went...

1422
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,685
...and then I shat.

1423
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,091
I shat in the theater.

1424
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,082
Jesus.
Oh, fuck.

1425
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,571
You guys okay?

1426
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,290
I broke my ass in half. Here.

1427
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,885
Shit, they got through!

1428
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,167
You guys fucking did it.
Oh, my God.

1429
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,241
Fuck. Did that hurt?

1430
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,606
Oh, yes, it fucking hurt.

1431
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,682
I loosened this up for
you, I'll have you know.

1432
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,569
Okay, just shut up. It's
fucking dark down here.

1433
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,086
Hold on, hold on.

1434
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,041
Nice.

1435
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,083
Okay, good. Thank you.
What is that?

1436
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,845
That's Terrence Peterson. My
monkey flashlight keychain.

1437
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,644
Monkey flashlight keychain?
Mmm-hmm.

1438
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,290
What's his name?
Terrence Peterson.

1439
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,771
You see it, Seth?
No. Where...

1440
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,171
Are you sure
it's even down here?

1441
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,287
Terry Pete.

1442
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,691
Uh, not sure.

1443
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,091
Is there, is there
any weird shit down here?

1444
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,050
Nah, it's where I keep all
my stuff from my old movies.

1445
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,360
Costumes, props.

1446
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,290
What?
Is someone down there?

1447
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,569
It's your fucking stupid
cutout from Spider-Man 3.

1448
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,165
Jesus Christ.

1449
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,287
No shit!

1450
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,481
- There it is!
- Yes! Yeah!

1451
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,483
- What, did you find it?
- Yeah!

1452

Mmm!

1459
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,082
That is so fucking good.

1460
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,605
The two heroes over here,
breaking through the floor.

1461
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,205
We did break through the floor.

1462
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,203
Any of you guys would
have done the same thing.

1463
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,601
Oh, man.
That fucking hurt.

1464
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,848
Yeah, I'm surprised
you didn't shart again.

1465
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,081
I think I did.

1466
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,003
Hey, what year
is this? 19...

1467
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,720
That's a good...
That's a good year.

1468
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,046
Hey, hey.
Yo, yo, yo!

1469
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,804
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1470
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,961
What am I doing?

1471
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,765
Fuck, man.

1472
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,763
I'm just pouring myself
another glass of water

1473
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,808
to wash down that dry-ass
Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

1474
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,120
That's very nice,
but you can't just

1475
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,880
pour yourself another
glass of water, man!

1476
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,001
Will you cut it out?

1477
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,367
Yeah. We agreed to
one glass at dinner,

1478
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,601
we voted on it, man.

1479
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,920
Well, man, I'm just
getting sick and tired

1480
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,365
of all these
fucking rules, man.

1481
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,851
You don't see me putting
rules on you guys.

1482
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,287
You cannot have
another glass of water.

1483
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,408
Jay weighs 150 pounds
less than me.

1484
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,369
Why the fuck is it fair

1485
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,329
that him and I should drink
the same amount of water?

1486
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,129
We should be
dividing our rations

1487
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,089
based on our
proportionate size.

1488
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,640
I don't want to come off
as a diva here or anything.

1489
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,960
It's just that I think everyone

1490
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,326
should split
everything equally.

1491
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,607
"I just think that everybody
should have the fucking same."

1492
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,762
"I have a goddamn earring."
Shut the fuck up, Jonah!

1493
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,569
You know what, Danny?
If you weren't jizzing

1494
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,483
all the time, maybe
you'd be more hydrated.

1495
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,164
You're making me into a
joke right now, Franco,

1496
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,049
and you are not gonna like
the fucking punch line.

1497
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,044
No more jerking off! No more water!
Just sit the fuck down!

1498
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,451
Okay, I'm done.

1499
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,726
We're not gonna
have any more water.

1500
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,801
Good.
All right.

1501
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,404
Hey!

1502
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,404
Someone help me!
Fucking grab it!

1503
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,400
What are you doing?

1504
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,520
You guys made this happen!

1505
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,040
You guys forced my fucking
hand by ganging up on me.

1506
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,090
God damn it, I'm gonna fucking
kill this motherfucker!

1507
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,606
That's what I thought.
Nerd.

1508
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,880
All right, guys,

1509
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,046
let's get rid of him.

1510
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,451
What?
What do you mean?

1511
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,045
Like, kick him
out of the house?

1512
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,885
His fucking reckless behavior
is dragging us all down.

1513
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,962
I mean, he wasted
our water twice.

1514
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,923
Two times. Two times.

1515
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,520
Dan is under a lot
of pressure. Okay?

1516
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,364
And he's not handling it as
good as the rest of us are.

1517
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,171
Look at him. He's wearing
my fucking tuxedo.

1518
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,844
He's been eating nonstop.

1519
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,287
The fucker's gained weight
since he got here.

1520
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,362
The fucker's got to go.

1521
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,441
Go.

1522
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,124
The fucker's got to go.

1523
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,210
This is how you all feel?

1524
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,566
We talked about it.

1525
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,530
You guys are gonna
vote me off the island?

1526
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,524
I mean, I made
you guys breakfast.

1527
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,887
Shit, man, you wasted half of
our food when you did that.

1528
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,691
Just thought I was doing
something nice for you guys.

1529
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,048
Just to apologize for my
behavior at the party.

1530
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,491
Party I wasn't even invited to.

1531
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,768
I'm not an idiot.

1532
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,846
I know why you guys don't fucking
call me or hang out with me anymore.

1533
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,009
It's because I party
so fucking hard.

1534
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,489
Always have.
Ever since I was a baby.

1535
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,289
I wouldn't just suck
on my mama's titties.

1536
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:26,489
I would fucking bang 'em
and motorboat 'em.

1537
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,207
Everything I've been doing
has just been a cry for help.

1538
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,090
When I came on
your magazine, James,

1539
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,128
it was a cum for help.

1540
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,000
I've just been crying and
comin' and crying and comin',

1541
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,921
tears from the tip
of my penis, dudes.

1542
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,964
I'm sorry, all right? You
can cum wherever you want.

1543
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,486
I don't even care about
cumming anymore.

1544
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,446
Right now, I'm just
kind of into going.

1545
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,284
Danny.
Danny.

1546
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,441
Hey.
Come on, man.

1547
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,045
I fucked up.

1548
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,360
I'm sorry, man.
Come on, look,

1549
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,164
I was wrong. SETH: I
feel like shit, man.

1550
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,730
I didn't want it
to happen like this.

1551
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,921
Let's just discuss it
some more, okay?

1552
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,286
Yeah. Let's just
talk, dude.

1553
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,045
We're giving you an option.
It's a choice, man.

1554
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,963
There's nothing to
figure out, all right?

1555
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,725
You guys have said enough, and
there's no going back anymore.

1556
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,884
I don't know if there maybe is, like,
something you guys could give me

1557
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,566
so I could at least have some sort
of protection while I'm out there.

1558
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,961
Danny, you don't
have to do this.

1559
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,451
- Yeah, man.
- All right,

1560
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,726
if you're really leaving

1561
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,122
then you should take this.

1562
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,890
Really?

1563
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,281
You don't know
what's out there.

1564
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,284
Thank you, James.

1565
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,562
It means a lot to you, and I
appreciate that you'd give this to me,

1566
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,483
you stupid,
stupid motherfucker!

1567
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,565
Fucking psychopath.
It's a prop gun!

1568
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,210
What, do you think I'd put
real bullets in here?

1569
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,601
You were gonna send me out
there with a fucking gun

1570
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,727
filled with blanks?
Oh, fuck you!

1571
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,040
Don't turn this around on us.

1572
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,122
You just tried to shoot
us, you fucking dickhead!

1573
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,247
Fucking murdering motherfucker!

1574
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,687
Whatever. Fucking
civilization is broken down.

1575
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,161
There's no more reason
for this false bullshit.

1576
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,163
You guys act like you're so
fucking high and mighty,

1577
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,527
like you've never made a
goddamn mistake before.

1578
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,568
Franco, you're just
a pretentious fucking nerd.

1579
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,687
Fuck you.

1580
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,841
And, Jonah,

1581
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,285
you fucking cunt.

1582
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,049
Craig, you didn't have
my back, back there.

1583
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,288
You fuckin' disappoint me. Bro.

1584
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,125
And, Seth,
you duplicitous taint.

1585
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,124
What? Then of course,
there's Jay,

1586
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,761
the self-righteous, cock-sucking,
two-faced backstabber.

1587
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,569
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1588
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,409
I overheard your little
conversation with Craig, all right?

1589
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,801
The only reason why you
care about any of us is

1590
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,530
because you think that's
what God wants you to do.

1591
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,965
You don't give a shit about us.

1592
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,168
No, no, no, no, that's fucking
twisting that shit...

1593
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,241
You're fucking lying.

1594
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,685
Am I twisting this?

1595
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,604
I believe you were
in Los Angeles

1596
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,523
two months ago,
at the Four Seasons.

1597
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,082
I saw you there, and you specifically
asked me not to tell Seth,

1598
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,726
so that you could
maintain the illusion

1599
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,245
that you always stay with Seth

1600
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,401
when you're in Los Angeles.

1601
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,130
Ooh!

1602
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,366
Jay.

1603
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,169
- Fuck, man.
- It's not...

1604
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,561
Textbook twattage.

1605
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,642
And just for
the record, you guys,

1606
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,007
I'm choosing to leave,
you're not kicking me out.

1607
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,208
You guys had already said
that I could come back in

1608
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,487
and I'm the one who said
that I'm not coming back in.

1609
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,846
Don't be cocky.

1610
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,645
Get the fuck out of here.

1611
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,970
Is that true?

1612
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,087
Yes.

1613
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,525
Jay...

1614
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,250
I know this is
probably my fault

1615
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,731
because I put you
on a pedestal,

1616
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,485
but you should not be
dishonest with your friends.

1617
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,642
But you really let me down.

1618
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,290
Hey! Whoa!
Jay, damn, man.

1619
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,727
- Fucker.
- What the hell?

1620
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,689
It's all fucked, isn't it?

1621
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,765
Jonah, you okay?
Yeah.

1622
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,571
Bleeding?

1623
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,361
Yeah.

1624
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,925
His insides hurt worse
than my outsides.

1625
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,051
Dear God,

1626
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,047
I'd like to pray
to You for a second.

1627
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,804
It's me, Jonah Hill.

1628
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,484
From <i>Moneyball.</i>

1629
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:28,203
I hate Jay so fucking much.

1630
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,250
I think he might be the worst
person You ever created.

1631
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,847
I don't want to
judge You, but...

1632
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,163
What's up? What were
You thinking that day?

1633
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,802
I love Seth, I love being his
friend, he's an awesome guy,

1634
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,167
but it's like Jay is
the last connection

1635
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,767
to his shitty,
weird Canadian life.

1636
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,684
Just do me one favor, God.

1637
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,644
Just kill Jay.

1638
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,644
That'd be so tight.

1639
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,769
Stop, man.

1640
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,002
Seriously, Craig, stop.

1641
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,403
Your nails are sharp.

1642
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,681
This is no dream!

1643
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,927
This is really happening!

1644
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,046
No!

1645
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,765
<i>Something, um, not that
chill happened last night.</i>

1646
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,044
<i>Yo, so, I just drank my own
pee for the first time.</i>

1647
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:50,123
<i>And it ain't bad.
I never thought to do it.</i>

1648
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,329
<i>I always thought, you know,
pee stink, whatever, but...</i>

1649
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,805
<i>Shh.</i>

1650
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,243
I think we all
remember how this works.

1651
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,482
Whoever gets the burnt match
has to go to one of Franco's

1652
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,483
neighbors' houses, get us
some food and some water.

1653
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,403
No-ho-ho.
No, I'm not going first.

1654
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,970
- I'll go first.
- Thank you.

1655
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,804
Very mature of you.
Thank you.

1656
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,605
Yes!

1657
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,409
Sorry.

1658
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,521
Good job.

1659
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,446
You okay, Jonah?

1660
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,567
What's that?

1661
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,721
You okay?

1662
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,244
Yeah. Just bad sleep.
Crazy dream.

1663
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,606
Here, Jonah.

1664
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,205
Jonah.

1665
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,362
Okay.
Shit.

1666
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,930
Craigers, you feeling lucky?

1667
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,730
Will history repeat itself?

1668
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,527
Thank you.

1669
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:02,846
You got this, dawg.

1670
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,087
Seth! No! Not you!

1671
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,241
I'm not going.

1672
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,727
What?
I'm not going.

1673
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,086
I'm bowing out.
I'm declining to go.

1674
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,207
What?

1675
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,440
Let me break it down for you.

1676
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,284
I'm not fucking going.

1677
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,408
You are definitely going.
Tell him he's fucking going.

1678
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,767
Tell you what, why don't you
fucking go, Mr. Self-Righteous?

1679
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,286
You're constantly saying what
assholes we are, how good you are.

1680
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,930
You go get us
some fuckin' water.

1681
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,166
I will go.

1682
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,970
Because I have

1683
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,929
- something called honor.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1684
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,809
That's good. Yeah,
you're very honorable.

1685
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,605
I'll go with you, Jay.

1686
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,841
Really?

1687
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,321
Is it because of
our pact upstairs?

1688
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,846
Nah, 'cause you got
them skinny-ass arms.

1689
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,968
You couldn't carry enough
to feed a hamster.

1690
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,487
It's working.

1691
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,365
Let's get that money.

1692
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,010
Let's do it.

1693
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,841
Yo. Out and to the left.
Shh-shh.

1694
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,367
Bye.

1695
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,691
Oh, my God.

1696
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,040
What?

1697
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,210
That's so sad.

1698
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,528
Innocence lost.

1699
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,925
What is that?

1700
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,167
Fire.

1701
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,730
There's, like, fire everywhere.

1702
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,086
Damn it!

1703
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,405
Hey, hey!

1704
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,487
Fuck, yeah. Let's
go, let's go, let's go.

1705
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,369
Hello?
Shut the fuck up!

1706
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,130
What? You
yelling that shit for?

1707
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,929
We got to find out...
Don't yell no more, man.

1708
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,002
Crack you in the head
with this frying pan.

1709
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:18,085
Okay. So we should probably
split up, cover more ground.

1710
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,447
What you think
this is, Scooby-Doo?

1711
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,210
We're gonna go in there, we're
gonna find the kitchen,

1712
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,009
and get as much shit
as we can, together!

1713
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,241
Then we're getting
the fuck out of here.

1714
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,089
All right, all right.
All right?

1715
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,801
Hey.

1716
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,526
Hey.

1717
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,204
What are you doing?

1718
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,487
That should be me out there.

1719
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,289
I totally fucked those guys.

1720
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,285
Mmm.

1721
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,761
Fuck was that?

1722
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,283
Oh, fuck!
Is he okay?

1723
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,521
Dude! Jonah!

1724
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,045
What the fuck?
What do we do?

1725
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,770
- Do you know first aid or anything?
- No.

1726
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,921
Jonah!
I suck at first aid.

1727
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,286
Are you okay? Shit!
Jonah?

1728
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,203
Oh, no.
Low blood sugar. LBS.

1729
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,123
LBS! He's having an LBS episode!

1730
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,248
I'll get the Milky Way!
You get the Milky Way!

1731
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,527
Ugh!

1732
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,650
Jay.

1733
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,402
Jonah, stay with me!
Stay with me.

1734
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,403
I got it, I got it, I got
it, got it, open his mouth.

1735
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,766
It's your friend, Seth.
Open his mouth.

1736
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,320
Open his mouth. Open his mouth.
I'll get this in there.

1737
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,731
Okay, okay.
Shove it right in there.

1738
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,325
Jonah.
Milky Way, Jonah.

1739
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,925
You love the Milky Way.
Yummy, yum.

1740
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,331
It's not fucking working, man!

1741
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,401
What the fuck!

1742
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,606
How do we get it in there?

1743
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,843
Chew it up, chew it up and spit
in his mouth like a baby bird.

1744
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,561
Mmm!

1745
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,720
You just swallowed it, man.

1746
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:36,761
It's so good.

1747
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,444
Give me a bite.

1748
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,601
Mmm!

1749
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,365
The second it hits your
mouth is, like, amazing.

1750
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,002
- Okay.
- Open it.

1751
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,004
What the fuck was that?

1752
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,128
That's Hebrew.
That's not Hebrew.

1753
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,565
It's fuckin' Latin
or something like that.

1754
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,881
I went to Hebrew school for six years.
That's not Hebrew.

1755
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,961
You will
drown in a river of blood.

1756
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,963
The End of Days is here.

1757
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,964
You will quiver in the
shadow of Kingdom Come.

1758
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,964
Judgment Day is upon you.

1759
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,329
The Apocalypse is nigh!

1760
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,848
Hey, I think
that's all it could fit.

1761
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:25,610
Man, let's take this back to
Franco's, get the fuck out of here.

1762
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,886
Uh, uh...

1763
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,806
What are we going back for?

1764
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,961
What are you talking about?

1765
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:34,011
In theory, we could
just fuckin' stay here.

1766
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:37,004
And here,
you don't have to sleep

1767
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,970
in a friggin'
tent under a dick.

1768
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,405
I like my dick tent.

1769
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,527
I'm just saying,

1770
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:46,400
we could build a life here together, Craig.
I'd be really good to you.

1771
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,763
All I know is
I'm scared as hell,

1772
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,645
and I just want to
get back to our friends.

1773
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,000
Yeah, but they're
not my friends.

1774
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,367
Seth is your friend.

1775
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,647
We've been growing
apart for years.

1776
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,331
That's why I didn't stay with
him last time I was here.

1777
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,846
And I stayed with him this
time to try and salvage it,

1778
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,684
but clearly
that didn't work out.

1779
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,411
Jay, like it or not,

1780
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,769
those assholes are all we got.

1781
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,801
Did you hear that?

1782
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,405
Yeah, that was a creak.

1783
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,522
What is that?

1784
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,928
What is that? Is that bile? Ew!

1785
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,088
I don't know.
It's cold.

1786
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,400
Sniff it.

1787
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,960
No. You sniff it.

1788
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,047
Ew!

1789
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,804
What?
It smells like puke.

1790
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,881
Ew! Ew!

1791
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,610
Don't get it on me! Ew!

1792
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,611
It's in my eyes!
Dude!

1793
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,001
It's in my mouth!
He's gone!

1794
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,242
Where is he?
He's fucking gone!

1795
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,567
Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit!

1796
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,646
Please, God!
Jesus, Jesus!

1797
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,281
Fuck.

1798
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,769
Jonah!
Jonah!

1799
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,922
Jonah, stop this!

1800
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,610
Please! Jonah, where
the fuck are you?

1801
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,330
Why did you vomit on us!

1802
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,683
Bad Jonah! Stop!

1803
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,603
Stop eating him!

1804
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,682
Watch out!
He's super strong!

1805
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,801
Aah!

1806
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,281
Shit!

1807
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,522
What is happen...

1808
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,761
Oh, no!

1809
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,604
I'm gonna
tittie-fuck you, Seth.

1810
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,125
Don't tittie-fuck me!

1811
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,645
What are they,
big B's or small C's?

1812
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,291
I'm gonna push
your titties together.

1813
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,010
Push 'em together!

1814
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,650
I'll get you something to help!

1815
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:54,721
I'll pass you something!

1816
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,881
Okay, pass it to me.

1817
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,488
OW! Fuck! Shit!

1818
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,521
Aah! Oh!

1819
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,646
Seth!

1820
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,202
We're getting crazy!

1821
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,406
Come on! Come on!

1822
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,326
Jesus, open, God damn you, open!

1823
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,483
No, no, no, no.

1824
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,725
Jesus...

1825
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,607
Oh, fuck.

1826
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,764
We gotta hide. We gotta hide.
I know!

1827
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,251
He's coming! He's coming!
I know he's coming!

1828
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,850
I don't know what the fuck to do!

1829
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,649
I don't know...

1830
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,405
Where are you going?

1831
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,404
Shit.

1832
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,928
Please go away.
He's sniffing.

1833
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:58,720
I'm so scared, James.

1834
01:17:58,760 --> 01:17:59,886
Be quiet.

1835
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,169
You're breathing really loud.
Am I?

1836
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,080
Don't breathe through your mouth.
Okay.

1837
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,924
Now you're doing loud
nose breathing. Am I?

1838
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,809
I don't know where else
to breathe from.

1839
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,566
Is that...
Seth.

1840
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,204
Oh, shit.
Don't move.

1841
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,930
Oh, shit, he's coming right this way.
Oh, shit.

1842
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,286
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1843
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,803
Get out of my way!
Move! Move!

1844
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,848
Fuck!

1845
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:39,961
You Okay?

1846
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,201
Come on!

1847
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:45,325
Let's go. Let's go.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1848
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,649
What the fuck! What are you doing?

1849
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,165
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1850
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,730
There's a fuckin'
demon chasing us!

1851
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,404
A demon?
Demon?

1852
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,324
What the fuck happened to you guys?
That!

1853
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,811
It's Jonah!
He's possessed!

1854
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,160
He's crazy!

1855
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,487
Oh, fuck!
You brained him.

1856
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,289
Is that... I was supposed
to do that, right?

1857
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,441
Yeah.

1858
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,683
Motherfucker.

1859
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,930
- Fasten!
- Hurry!

1860
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,365
Fasten, God damn you, bastard!

1861
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,521
He's gonna be fuckin'

1862
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,925
bad news when he wakes up!

1863
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,843
He's fuckin' strong.

1864
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,604
My side's good.
Oh, shit!

1865
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,250
All right,
I'll fuckin' hit him.

1866
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,930
Fuck! Come on, come on! Okay!

1867
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,806
This shit's cray cray, guys.

1868
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,090
I mean, it's, like,
the real, like Apocalypse.

1869
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,481
It's, like,
the Book of Revelations,

1870
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,722
like that means there's a God.

1871
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,131
Right?

1872
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,885
I haven't led my life as though
there's a God this whole time.

1873
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,440
Who fuckin' saw that coming?
That there's actually a God?

1874
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,842
I'd say 95% of the planet.

1875
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,488
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

1876
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,648
You might want to stay
away from saying that.

1877
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,166
"Jesus fucking Christ"?
Why?

1878
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,964
Why can't I say that? One
of the Ten Commandments.

1879
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,884
"Thou shall not take the name
of the Lord thy God in vain."

1880
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,405
Jesus isn't the name
of the Lord.

1881
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,686
God is name of the Lord.

1882
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,808
Jesus, God, it's all the same.

1883
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,201
It's the Trinity.
Father, Son, Holy Ghost.

1884
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,169
It's like Neapolitan ice cream.

1885
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,844
I don't even know what
the fucking Commandments are.

1886
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:19,084
Guys, I think this is sort of bullshit,
because we're all good people.

1887
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,324
I can look at each one of you
in the eye, I know you're good.

1888
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,050
I'm good.
We're four actors.

1889
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,088
We bring joy to people's lives.

1890
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,889
Yeah, but we don't
do it for free.

1891
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,170
We get paid handsomely, much higher
than the average profession.

1892
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,041
It's not like it was just
handed to any of us.

1893
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,730
We've worked really
hard to be here.

1894
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,928
Yeah, pretend like
it's hot when it's cold.

1895
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,602
You sitting on the beach,
it's freezing,

1896
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:44,765
you in your drawers, talking about
something, everybody's surfing.

1897
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,047
I think God
might have just fucked up,

1898
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,169
made a mistake, and left
us behind by accident.

1899
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,248
I mean, He's got a lot
of shit on His plate.

1900
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:55,403
It's not an oversight,
it's not a mistake, okay?

1901
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:59,644
We got to face facts. We're here, and
there's a reason we're all here.

1902
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,041
Why are you so sure?

1903
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,202
I've done things, man. I...

1904
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,084
I gouged a man's eyeballs out.

1905
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,924
What the...
Fuck off.

1906
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,764
Craig.
Well, I was a kid, man.

1907
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,047
It was a fuckin' bar fight.

1908
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,451
It was a bad foosball game.

1909
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:19,205
He said I didn't call spinneys,
and I fuckin' called spinneys.

1910
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:22,124
He got all in my face, and I smashed
a bottle across his face...

1911
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,724
...and the
first eyeball was an accident,

1912
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,451
but then I was, like, fuck it,
and I went for the second one.

1913
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,568
It was fucked up.
But you know what?

1914
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:34,089
That shit happens. I'm saying, that's...
I think that's why I'm here.

1915
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,248
I got to admit something.

1916
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,606
I, uh...

1917
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,891
I fucked Lindsay Lohan.

1918
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,844
She was fucked up.
She was high.

1919
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,200
It was at the Chateau Marmont,

1920
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,520
and she kept banging
on my door.

1921
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,809
She kept calling
me Jake Gyllenhaal.

1922
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,166
That's fucked up.

1923
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,767
Yeah, I said, "Call me
the Prince of Persia."

1924
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,046
See, that's what
I'm saying, man.

1925
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,088
We've all done bad shit,
you know?

1926
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:01,767
We've done more bad shit than
good in our lives, and

1927
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:06,004
it's time to pay the piper.

1928
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,121
Whoa, shit!

1929
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,202
Something's wrong.

1930
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,491
God did this.

1931
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:16,161
He gave us light, and then He took it away.

1932
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,605
You hear that?

1933
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,762
It's the soundtrack
of us going insane.

1934
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,684
Damn, I wish there was something
we could do to help him.

1935
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,370
I know what we can do.

1936
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,089
The fuckin' stench.

1937
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:50,881
Jonah Hill?

1938
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,931
Jonah?

1939
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,531
Jonah Hill.

1940
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,728
Jonah Hill is no more.

1941
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,086
Demon?

1942
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,003
Yes?

1943
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,003
Fuck. That's not good.

1944
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,366
That's not good.

1945
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,650
Jay, you fool.

1946
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,200
I say unto thee,

1947
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,166
the power of Christ
compels you!

1948
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:19,084
Oh, does it?
Does it compel me?

1949
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,208
The power of Christ
compels you!

1950
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,281
Does it, Jay?

1951
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,283
The power of Christ
compels you!

1952
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,362
Is the power of Christ compelling me?
Is that what's happening?

1953
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,000
The power of Christ compels you!

1954
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,526
Guess what?
It's not that compelling.

1955
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,762
Jay, you serious right now?

1956
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,127
That's your fuckin' plan? You're gonna
repeat lines from <i>The Exorcist?</i>

1957
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,402
I would assume they did
their fuckin' research.

1958
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,323
It's a movie!
It's a manual.

1959
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,480
It's a fuckin' training manual.

1960
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,685
I say unto thee,

1961
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,440
the power of Christ
compels you!

1962
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,727
The power of Christ
compels you!

1963
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,722
The power of Christ
compels you!

1964
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,365
Geez, it hurts a little bit.

1965
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,680
It's, like, this little sting.

1966
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,201
The power of Christ
compels you!

1967
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,361
Seriously, fuck off.

1968
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,966
The power of Christ
compels you!

1969
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,651
Jay?

1970
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,524
The power of Christ
compels you!

1971
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,647
Holy shit!

1972
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,250
You're pissing him off, man.
Just stop it!

1973
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,129
Jay! The power of
Christ compels you!

1974
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,449
The power of...
Get the fuck down!

1975
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,608
Don't fucking push me, asshole!
Geez, man!

1976
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,681
Fuck you! Easy!

1977
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:21,841
You're a fucking
asshole, you liar!

1978
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:22,921
Still?

1979
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,001
Yes. Still? Yes.

1980
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,565
Guys, guys, we got
a possessed guy here!

1981
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,244
Do we have to argue
about this right now?

1982
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,287
Let 'em fight.

1983
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:29,885
We got an exorcism
to finish. Hello?

1984
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,240
Do you want to know why
I didn't stay with you?

1985
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,890
Yeah.
You fuckin' changed.

1986
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,850
You're a fuckin'
sell-out.

1987
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,161
You did fuckin' sell out.
Everyone says.

1988
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:42,086
At least I did change! You act like
you're fucking 18 years old still, Jay!

1989
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,481
Grow up, Jay. That's why
he's yelling at you.

1990
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,648
You've been holding me
back this whole time!

1991
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,290
That means fuck you.

1992
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,408
Come on, guys! Come on!

1993
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,762
Fuck you, you piece of shit!

1994
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,326
Everybody, out!

1995
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,640
Craig, stop 'em!

1996
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,529
- Get apart!
- Oh, now it's on.

1997
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,001
Yo! What the fuck
is all this, Franco?

1998
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,960
Uh, looks like food.
How'd that get there?

1999
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,401
What?
You have more food?

2000
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,686
You knew he had extra food?

2001
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,489
Yeah, he gave me one cracker.

2002
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,130
I would have sucked a
dick for half a cracker.

2003
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,441
All right, well, maybe I didn't want
you to suck my dick, all right?

2004
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,686
- Look...
- I didn't want to suck it!

2005
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,444
That's the point of what I said!
It was my fucking food!

2006
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,521
Guys, guys, guys, fire!

2007
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,647
Boys, boys, boys...

2008
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,762
Shit!
Jonah's on fire!

2009
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,891
Put it out!

2010
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,371
Use your mouth!
Put it out!

2011
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,725
Go, go, go, go, go!

2012
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,210
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?

2013
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,441
Go, go, go!

2014
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,644
Go, go, go, go, go!

2015
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,484
Go, get outside!

2016
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,483
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit!

2017
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,561
Go, go on!

2018
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:05,722
Come on, hurry up, he's coming!

2019
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,484
He's coming!

2020
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,290
Watch out, watch out!

2021
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,961
Oh, my fortress!

2022
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,724
Uh, boys, I just want
to point out, um,

2023
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,290
we're out in the open now.

2024
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,126
Oh, fuck.
Shit, shit, shit.

2025
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,362
Oh, shit.
Hey, hey, hey.

2026
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,566
My Prius.
Yeah!

2027
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,449
Yeah!
Yes!

2028
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,681
What is that?

2029
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,442
No fucking way.

2030
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,528
We're screwed!

2031
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,080
We're totally screwed, guys.

2032
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:52,921
I got this.

2033
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,570
What?
I'll distract the thing.

2034
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,608
I'll run over there
screaming and shit,

2035
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:00,287
and that should give you enough
time to get to the garage.

2036
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,004
Well, yeah, but that
thing can kill you.

2037
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:05,482
Maybe I deserve it. I've
been shitty my whole life.

2038
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,801
Being selfish,
only doing shit for me.

2039
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,201
Maybe it's only right
that the last thing I do

2040
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:13,363
on this planet isn't for me.

2041
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,840
It's for you guys.

2042
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,649
Craig, you don't
have to do that.

2043
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,051
Thank you very much, Craig.

2044
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,884
I appreciate that.
You spineless...

2045
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,523
I love you guys.

2046
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,370
You're my best friends.

2047
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,442
You're a real mensch, Craig.

2048
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,727
See you on the other side.

2049
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,329
Hey, hey, asshole!
Hey, come on!

2050
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,482
Pickle dick, demonic-looking
motherfucker.

2051
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,688
Nobody's scared of you.
You ain't a raccoon!

2052
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,569
Yeah, bring your ass, bitch!

2053
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:45,530
Nobody's scared of you!
I'm Craig fucking Robinson!

2054
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,846
Yeah.

2055
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,081
What's he gonna do?
Craig.

2056
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:51,249
I hope you like big dick,
motherfucker,

2057
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,163
'cause I'm about
to fuck you raw!

2058
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,527
For the last goddamn time!

2059
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,644
Take your panties off!

2060
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,130
Fuck, yeah!

2061
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:13,447
It worked.

2062
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,045
What's happening?

2063
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,122
Craig! Craig!

2064
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:33,209
Holy shit, do you guys
realize what this means?

2065
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,841
That Craig was an angel
this whole time?

2066
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,770
No, no, it means we can
still be saved. No, no.

2067
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,610
I don't fucking get it, why
does Craig get saved? I mean...

2068
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,047
Craig sacrificed
himself for us,

2069
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,929
which means that
there's still hope.

2070
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,849
- That means we can be redeemed.
- Yeah.

2071
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,649
It means that if we're
actually nice to each other,

2072
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,525
we can get sucked up into Heaven, too.
That's the deal.

2073
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,324
All right, I got it,
let's just head out

2074
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,687
to my place in Malibu.
Yeah.

2075
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,923
Just survive long enough until
we do enough good things

2076
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,048
and they accumulate
or do enough sacrifices,

2077
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,246
and we'll all go
to Heaven together.

2078
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,288
That's a great idea, James.

2079
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,050
Seriously, really,
really good idea.

2080
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,963
Really, you're
such a smart guy.

2081
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,088
Thanks, Seth,
you're such a nice guy.

2082
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,401
You got a great smile.

2083
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,164
Thanks, man.
And an awesome laugh.

2084
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,248
I've heard it's annoying. How
about that Jay back there, man?

2085
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,930
Dude, Jay, you kidding me?
Come on. Oh, come on.

2086
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,326
One of a kind.
Get out of here.

2087
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,606
You got a cool body.

2088
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,170
You can walk around with
your shirt off anytime.

2089
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:24,890
It's not working,
this isn't working.

2090
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,801
What, you thought we would
be Raptured already?

2091
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:27,927
I thought it would
happen already.

2092
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,126
No, we've just
been talking nice.

2093
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,089
Talking nice doesn't
get you into Heaven.

2094
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,288
Doesn't hurt to smile...

2095
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:36,921
What the fuck?

2096
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,331
You guys okay?

2097
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,129
Oh, shit.
Christ.

2098
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,805
- Franco!
- Come on!

2099
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,370
Yo, cut his fucking head off!

2100
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:57,566
What's going on?

2101
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,888
No!

2102
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,200
- No!
- Stop!

2103
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,881
Danny?

2104
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,166
What the fuck?

2105
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,366
You guys are still alive?

2106
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,561
Yeah.

2107
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,722
Holy shit,
I didn't expect that.

2108
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,723
Fuck out here.

2109
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:30,687
Get...

2110
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,564
Shit, I can't believe
you guys are here. Oh, Jesus.

2111
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:36,406
That's fucking crazy, and your
timing couldn't be more perfect.

2112
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:39,366
It's been a long time
since any of us have eaten,

2113
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,250
and you three gentlemen
look delicious.

2114
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,446
What does that
have to do with us?

2115
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,363
The fuck are you talking about?

2116
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,124
I'm a cannibal, hombre.

2117
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,009
We're gonna
fucking eat your ass.

2118
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,650
Fuck you, you can't eat us.
Fuck that, man.

2119
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:53,564
I do whatever the fuck
I want, when I want.

2120
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,244
I butt-fucked this dude.

2121
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,401
See that?

2122
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,084
I fucking slide
right in that shit.

2123
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,925
I do whatever I want.
This is my gimp.

2124
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,570
Channing, introduce yourself.

2125
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:04,921
Hey, what's up, guys?

2126
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,411
Y'all cool?

2127
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:07,931
That's Channing Tatum.

2128
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,764
That's Channing Tatum,
dude. What the fuck?

2129
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,968
Channing fucking Tatum. I found
him wandering on the freeway.

2130
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:14,725
I collected him, made him my bitch.
Get off my dick.

2131
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,644
I call him
Channing Tate-yum.

2132
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:18,801
Hard-core, man.

2133
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:19,961
I got him trained good.

2134
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,690
Watch, he does tricks.
Wait, shake hands.

2135
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,966
All right, Seth.

2136
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:24,286
Fucking roll over.

2137
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,850
I'm gonna create a diversion.
Yeah.

2138
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,809
- You and Jay make a run for it.
- What?

2139
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,450
Danny's gonna eat you.

2140
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,490
Listen, full-on sacrifice
for you, dawg,

2141
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,640
- like the ending to <i>Pineapple 2.</i>
- Yeah, lick that.

2142
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:36,284
That's Channing
fucking Tatum, dawg.

2143
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:37,886
I love him.

2144
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:40,930
That's fucking G.I. Joe, dude.
Fucking loves me.

2145
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,766
Danny! We're friends!
You can't eat us!

2146
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:48,368
I'd love to catch up, but we're
fucking starving, so let's eat!

2147
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,527
Fuck you!

2148
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,725
Run!

2149
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,007
Eat this!

2150
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:59,525
Ow! Shit, fuck!
Get him!

2151
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:02,000
Who wants it,
you piece of shit?

2152
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,406
Man, we should go back.

2153
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,400
We should go back and help him.
We should go back.

2154
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,687
Fucking Rapture.

2155
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,762
Holy shit!
It worked!

2156
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,765
What the fuck?

2157
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,161
Go to hell, McBride!

2158
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,844
Fuck you!

2159
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,763
Suck my dick!

2160
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,447
Ah...

2161
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:29,406
Oh!

2162
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,850
- Oh, shit.
- What happened?

2163
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,082
What did I do?
Take me back!

2164
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:35,161
What did I do?

2165
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,241
I'll tell you
what happened, Franco.

2166
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,362
You don't get to get
sucked up into Heaven

2167
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:41,808
'cause you were being petty.
Tom Petty.

2168
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,803
You may not have
invited me to your party,

2169
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,204
but you're the guest
of honor at mine.

2170
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,327
What?

2171
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,171
How fucking crazy is this?

2172
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,009
Seth, Jay!

2173
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,684
Oh, shit, they're
running after us.

2174
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,485
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit! Run.

2175
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,050
Bring them to me!

2176
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,487
- Fuck.
- Get 'em!

2177
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,843
Got to get Rogen.

2178
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,127
Over here.

2179
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,004
What? Over here, over here.
Here. What?

2180
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:15,845
Shit, shit.

2181
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,409
They're around here somewhere.

2182
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,440
They kept
running, you fucking idiots.

2183
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,404
Shit, are they still there?

2184
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,005
I think they're gone.
Are they gone?

2185
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:25,963
Oh, my God. Why did
Franco flip off Danny?

2186
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,644
Why did he have
to do that, man?

2187
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:28,767
He was in the clear.

2188
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,365
That is textbook.

2189
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:31,965
Vanity or...

2190
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:33,280

Vanity or envy.

2191
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,725
Is it envy or wrath?

2192
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,848
It's any of them, man.
You can't do that.

2193
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,490
It's being a sore winner,
is what it is,

2194
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,891
more than anything.
That's exactly what it is.

2195
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,200
You can't be a sore winner. No.

2196
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,526
Well, this is another fine
mess we found ourselves in.

2197
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:50,081

2201
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:05,403

fucking shitting me!

2202
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:09,201
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.

2203
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,486

2204
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,686

2205
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:13,046
Oh, it's so big.

2206
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:17,011
Oh, man.
Oh, Jesus.

2207
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,326
We're gonna die, man.
Okay.

2208
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,481

Oh, no!

2210

Shit.
Listen to me, man.

2211
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,571
I'm a fucking idiot.
I put myself up.

2212
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:45,971
I'm self-righteous.

2213
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,570
I think I'm better than you.
No, no.

2214
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,801
I was resistant to change.

2215
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,888
No. I should have
grown with you.

2216
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,928
I should have changed with you.

2217
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:54,326
We should have
changed together.

2218
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,768
I didn't like what I became
so I hated what you became.

2219
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,604
It's fine, man.
It's fine.

2220
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,529
I love you, Seth, fucking love you, buddy.
I love you, man.

2221
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,085
I always loved you. Let's
die together, man.

2222
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,003
Let's die together.
I love you, Jay.

2223
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,205
Holy shit, Jay, all right!

2224
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,327
Yeah, we did it!

2225
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,805
I'm not getting
sucked up into Heaven!

2226
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,086
What do you mean?
Why not?

2227
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:22,764
I don't know why not!

get pulled up, too!
