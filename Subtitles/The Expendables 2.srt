Uh... Long story.

329
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:54,924
- I would like to hear it.
- All right.

330
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,887
I was trained as a sniper,
and an instructor, too,

331
00:26:59,972 --> 00:27:03,641
but I actually wanted to mix it up,
get in on the action.

332
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:07,770
Uh, this one time, we're stuck out
in this hell-hole valley.

333
00:27:08,397 --> 00:27:12,525
About 30 Taliban opened up
from these houses in the hills above us.

334
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,694
And they got about eight of us
pinned down bad.

335
00:27:14,778 --> 00:27:18,656
So I called in for artillery support.
But, "No way," says the captain.

336
00:27:19,032 --> 00:27:21,033
Didn't wanna endanger the locals.

337
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:26,706
So we scattered. Some crawled to a ditch,
some to the dry riverbed and the rest bailed.

338
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,624
But we were still stuck in the kill zone.

339
00:27:29,918 --> 00:27:33,629
And we battled for,
I don't know, three hours.

340
00:27:35,632 --> 00:27:39,260
And finally, an Apache gunship chopper
showed up to provide air cover.

341
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:41,178
Scattered the Hadjis, but...

342
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:48,602
Smoke clears and four of my squad are dead
in the ditch and two in the riverbed.

343
00:27:55,652 --> 00:28:00,197
Yeah, I was mad and sick,
all dead for nothin'.

344
00:28:04,453 --> 00:28:07,621
You know the most screwed up thing of all

345
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:09,999
is when I got back to base that night,

346
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:14,503
I found out that they had shot
this stray dog that I adopted.

347
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:18,674
Commander's orders to get rid
of all animals on the base.

348
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,346
I mean, you'd think we had enough damn
shooting for one day, you know?

349
00:28:27,768 --> 00:28:30,728
And, anyway,
I figured it was time to move on.

350
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:35,358
I heard these guys were looking
for someone, and here I am.

00:28:52,084 --> 00:28:53,334

- Yes. Apparently, 15 kilometers northwest.

No, do you?
