1
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,383
Okay, okay, I can see him.

2
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,095
- That's it. Here he comes.
- Careful.

3
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,223
All right. I got him. I got him.

4
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,016
- Sensors.
- Ahem.

5
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,602
- Vitals?
- Stable.

6
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,187
- Clamp.
- Scissors.

7
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,980
Scissors.

8
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,858
Severing umbilical.

9
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,110
Umbilical cut. Okay, clear.

10
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,154
Wait. Dropping fast. BP's dropping fast.

11
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,406
Respirations are slow,
shallow, and irregular.

12
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,618
O2 sat's down 82 percent.
BP 80 over 30. He's in V-tach!

13
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,912
- Get the paddles.
- May I have some Dopamine?

14
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,205
Dopamine.

15
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,960
- I've got the paddles.
- Okay. Everybody clear.

16
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,586
All clear.

17
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,005
Clear!

18
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,845
Heart rate's stable.

19
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,229
Easy. Easy.

20
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,065
Okay, we're good.

21
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,781
No physical discrepancies.

22
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,908
He's perfect.

23
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,036
He's just perfect.

24
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,001
I like Melvin.
He's much more of a Melvin.

25
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,254
Somehow Ginger and Melvin
doesn't have quite the same ring to it.

26
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,048
Okay, then, Fred it is.

27
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,720
All right.

28
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,850
Come on, little fella. Ahem.

29
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,727
Look at that.

30
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,645
He's so cute.

31
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,949
All set?

32
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,659
Let's do it.

33
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,536
All right.

34
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,750
- Okay.
- We're good.

35
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,918
Nice.

36
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,757
Ginger, meet Fred. Fred, meet Ginger.

37
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,457
- What are they doing?
- Imprinting.

38
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,515
See?

39
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,558
Love at first sight.

40
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,909
I wish you would fill me in.

41
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,204
I like to think we're a team.
I like to think I'm a sounding board.

42
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,833
- You're much more than that, Barlow.
- It's just another dog-and-pony show.

43
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,961
- We could splice a dog and pony.
- They can take the meeting for us.

44
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,004
Maybe I can help you with your publicity.

45
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,092
"If God didn't want us to explore
his domain, why'd he give us the map?"

46
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,510
Bumper-sticker wisdom.

47
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,346
I get it, and I am totally with you guys
on every level.

48
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,100
But Joan Charot can make or break
our project without even blinking.

49
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,603
We should all be nervous,
as in survival-instinct nervous, so come on...

50
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,397
...who's heads up?

51
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,691
I don't want to spoil the surprise.
Come on.

52
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,360
- You love surprises.
- No, surprises make me nauseous.

53
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,655
Over the course of the last
three years, our lab has combined...

54
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:33,160
...the DNA from a variety of species
to create a completely new life form.

55
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,997
And, as you know,
Ginger has exceeded all expectations...

56
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,333
...in her ability to produce
medicinal proteins for livestock.

57
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,044
What you don't know is that,
since the birth of Fred...

58
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,255
...we have an upgraded
splicing technique...

59
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:49,468
...which can be applied to the most
sophisticated of organisms, namely...

60
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,054
...- human beings.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

61
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,390
Hold on. Let's not get
too far ahead of ourselves.

62
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,893
By incorporating human DNA
into the hybrid template...

63
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,730
...we can begin to address any number
of genetically-influenced diseases.

64
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:07,068
Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes,
even some forms of cancer.

65
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,285
Well...

66
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:21,249
I can't tell you how, um, excited we are.

67
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:26,796
The entire board is thrilled
with the progress you've made...

68
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:31,593
...which is why we are so anxious
to move on to phase two.

69
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,263
- Phase two?
- The product stage.

70
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:40,310
We need to isolate the gene in Ginger
and Fred that produces your magic protein.

71
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,939
We are shutting down
the splicing facilities...

72
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,608
...retooling your labs
for intensive chemical analysis.

73
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,443
Shutting down?

74
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,945
I don't understand.

75
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,572
Uh, we're handing you
the medical breakthrough of the century.

76
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,782
We could begin...

77
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,618
Elsa! We all know that can't happen
right now.

78
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,371
The moral outrage would be
completely out of control.

79
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,874
I mean, regulators and politicians,
they'd tear us to pieces.

80
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,338
Please.

81
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:13,218
If we don't use human DNA now,
someone else will.

82
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,143
Look, we'd love to go there.

83
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:27,732
Shoot for incredible medical breakthroughs,
of course we would.

84
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,152
You put a viable livestock product
on the shelves...

85
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,991
...then we will talk about a 20-year plan
to save the world.

86
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:40,328
Right now, we need to start phase two...

87
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:44,165
...and you are the only ones who can do it.

88
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,173
We could quit. Go to Hamilton-Splinter.

89
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,342
Newstead owns our patents.
We'd lose everything.

90
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,681
Well? What?

91
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,519
I'm not spending the next five years
digging through pig shit for enteric proteins.

92
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,280
Me neither.

93
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,210
What's the profile?

94
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,046
Jane Doe.

95
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,716
Anonymous female donor.
Clean medical and heredity. The usual.

96
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,760
A dime a dozen.

97
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,262
One in a million.

98
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,916
- It's not working.
- What enzyme are you using?

99
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,085
It's not the cleavage.
They're digesting fine.

100
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,294
So?

101
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,963
The human Alu sequences
don't wanna bond with foreigners.

102
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,758
So what? We'll use a ligase other than T4.
We'll make them.

103
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,343
Oh, we'll just make them.

104
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:23,264
Yeah, we will. You know why?
Because Wired doesn't interview losers.

105
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,351
Sometimes I forget those
basic scientific principles.

106
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,286
This retarded, fascist,
über music is the fucking problem.

107
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,706
Got us thinking in circles.

108
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,468
You're right.

109
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,554
We have been dancing to the wrong beat.

110
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,222
Try this.

111
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,725
M3.

112
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,400
It's not working.

113
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,906
- Wait a second. It's happening.
- Why now?

114
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,492
I don't know, but they're on fire.

115
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,163
- We got the right temperature. The enzyme...
- They're changing partners.

116
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,375
- Everyone dances with everyone.
- You are Bob fucking Fosse.

117
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,968
All right.

118
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,847
Biotechnology's most startling
breakthrough in decades...

119
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,891
...on ice.

120
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,311
Well, at least we know
we can do it, right?

121
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,815
Elsa.

122
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,193
Elsa, come on. What are you doing?

123
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,321
Elsa.

124
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,115
I'm too tired for this, Elsa.

125
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,786
Come on. I don't have the energy
to play with you right now. Elsa?

126
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,370
I'm not playing around with you.

127
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,500
Come on. Hey!

128
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,339
- What, did you recode the locks?
- I recoded the locks.

129
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,758
Come on. Open the door.

130
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,303
Elsa. Seriously.

131
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,807
You see, this is what's known
in couples therapy as emotional hijacking.

132
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,975
Elsa?

133
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,192
Come on, this is illegal. We're gonna
go to jail for this. Open the door.

134
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,570
Human cloning is illegal.
This won't be human, not entirely.

135
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,447
What? What are you doing?

136
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,407
Relax. We won't take it to term.

137
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,035
We need to know if we can
generate a sustainable embryo.

138
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,956
- Then we destroy it. No one will know.
- What's the point if you can't publish?

139
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,793
To be sure we really did it.
To know for sure.

140
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,920
You're telling me you don't need to know?

141
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,590
This is not so simple.
There are moral considerations.

142
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,677
Millions of people are suffering
and dying with no hope.

143
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,637
We might have the key to saving them.

144
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,639
What are the moral considerations
of that?

145
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,550
- Fuck.
- Exactly.

146
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,840
How's it coming, little brother?

147
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,550
Good.

148
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,594
How's Fred doing?

149
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,679
Our boy is growing up into
a fine young man.

150
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,016
And phase two?

151
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,894
Don't worry. We'll nail that gene.

152
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,648
Good man. Double helix. Ha, ha.

153
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,858
Hey, uh, I can't help...

154
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,070
...but wonder what you and Elsa
have been so busy with.

155
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,239
Building you your very own
special friend, Gavin.

156
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,283
Thank you.

157
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,953
I have been so lonely.

158
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,621
Not for long.

159
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,440
Come on, come on, come on.

160
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,884
Can you not do that?

161
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,763
Can you not do that?

162
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,433
- Hmm?
- Don't do that.

163
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,560
- What?
- Don't do that.

164
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,604
My Zeppelin interpolation, come on.
You don't like it?

165
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,816
Zeppelin crashed and burned before
I was born.

166
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,485
Check this out. It's near the distillery.

167
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,321
I fucking love it.

168
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,657
Yeah, it's cool.

169
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,951
You don't sound that enthusiastic.

170
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,788
I don't know, I just don't want to
move again any time soon.

171
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,374
We've been here for seven years.

172
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,627
No, I mean from that place.
It just doesn't seem big enough.

173
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:34,052
It's twice the size of this apartment.
More than enough room for all our stuff.

174
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,971
But, you know, for down the road.

175
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,310
You are talking about a kid, aren't you?

176
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,645
- That so unreasonable?
- Yeah.

177
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,856
Because I'm the one who has to have it.

178
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,025
Look, I love this place.

179
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,987
I don't wanna bend my life to suit some
third party that doesn't even exist yet.

180
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,156
Come on. Come here.

181
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,912
What's the worst that can happen?

182
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,541
How about after we crack
male pregnancy?

183
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,585
Ha, ha. And ruin this perfect figure?

184
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,839
- You're a hypocrite. You're a hypocrite.
- No. You're a hypocrite.

185
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,761
Who is it?

186
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,513
Ignore it.

187
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,057
- What?
- It's BETI.

188
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,942
- Holy shit. What's going on?
- It's coming out.

189
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,194
What? It can't do that.
It's not due for months.

190
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,779
Well, tell that to the fetus.

191
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,198
Oh, God, it's huge.

192
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,200
- I thought you were keeping tabs.
- I was.

193
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,619
It wasn't that big this morning.

194
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,789
Too much pressure. It'll kill it.

195
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,255
Okay. Okay, we're gonna
have to do this manually.

196
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,050
It's not depressurizing.

197
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,969
All right.

198
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,227
Can you feel it?

199
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,148
I can't. It's slippery. It's... Aah!

200
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,732
What? What is it?

201
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,277
- Aah!
- What? What? What is it?

202
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,987
It's stinging.

203
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,655
No, don't, don't.

204
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,449
- Latch on. Come on.
- No, don't! Don't!

205
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,788
All right, hold on. Hold on.

206
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,089
Close your eyes.

207
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,091
- What?
- Close your eyes!

208
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,267
Hold still.

209
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,644
Don't move.

210
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,247
Aah!

211
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,293
Look out, look out.

212
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,970
Oh, my God.

213
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,057
Hey, hey.

214
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,061
Come on, come on. No, no, no.

215
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,812
Oh, God.

216
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,119
All right, don't worry.

217
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,498
Hang on, hang on.

218
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,672
Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

219
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,674
Come on, come on, come on.

220
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,636
You okay? You okay? Are you okay?

221
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,388
What was that?

222
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,224
What was that?

223
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,227
A mistake.

224
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,965
Do you think it's in pain?

225
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,718
What?

226
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,595
It's not formed right.

227
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,057
We don't know that.

228
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,146
I'm gonna kill it.

229
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,981
Wait!

230
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,234
There's still a lot we can learn.

231
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,239
We can find out how close we came...

232
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,908
...to something sustainable.

233
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,911
Clive.

234
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,080
It's okay.

235
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,666
It's all right.

236
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,629
It's not all right.

237
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,132
It's wrong.

238
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,060
Do we have to do this?

239
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:37,646
You don't have to. I'll take care of it.

240
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,793
Jesus, I think it's dead.

241
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,836
What?

242
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,257
Hold this.

243
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,475
- Careful, careful.
- Yeah, yeah.

244
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,565
Yep.

245
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,653
I'll bag it.

246
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,196
Well...

247
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,908
...at least it's not in pain now.

248
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,244
Yeah.

249
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,768
It's empty.

250
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,070
Clive?

251
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,739
Clive?

252
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,242
Clive?

253
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,164
Gavin.

254
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,790
Clive!

255
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,894
- What happened?
- It's alive.

256
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,438
Oh, Jesus.

257
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,441
Don't! Don't, don't! Lt'll get out.

258
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,694
Shit!

259
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,204
Shit.

260
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,500
- Get out of there. I'm gonna gas it.
- Wait.

261
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,169
Don't kill it.

262
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,380
Elsa, get out, okay? I'm hitting the gas.

263
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,136
I'm not gonna hurt you.

264
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,349
In three, two, one!

265
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,268
Clive, I said don't!

266
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,646
Put your fucking mask back on, Elsa!

267
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,440
Listen! Goddamn it,
you never listen to me!

268
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,818
Put your damn mask on! It's dangerous!

269
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,404
Elsa, please.

270
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,284
I'm not gonna hurt you.

271
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,678
It's imprinting.

272
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,978
You're really something, aren't you?

273
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,072
Come on. Come on. Get out.

274
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,242
Get out! Get out! How about listening?

275
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,583
Are you crazy? Huh?
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

276
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,251
I had the situation under control.

277
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,337
You had it under control?
You're forgetting why we came here.

278
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:34,174
You know what?
We can't do that now, all right? Look at it.

279
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,676
What's that supposed to mean?

280
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,846
Let's just knock it out with some ether,
find out what we've got.

281
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:19,219
This is unbelievable.
I don't even know what half of this is.

282
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,515
There must be some rogue elements.
Junk genes pushing through.

283
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,686
Be careful with that.

284
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,068
It's some kind
of self-defense mechanism.

285
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,819
Yeah, or attack venom.

286
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,739
None of her animal components
have predatory characteristics.

287
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,534
Well, there's the human element.

288
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,412
What are these?

289
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:49,792
- Lungs?
- No. These are the lungs.

290
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,919
Tumors?

291
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,340
Well, I guess we'll find out
in the autopsy.

292
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,554
This wasn't supposed to go this far.
It wasn't even supposed to go full-term.

293
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,431
But it did.

294
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,101
What happened to,
"We're just gonna prove we can do it"?

295
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:10,396
So, what are you saying?
You really gonna kill it? Hmm?

296
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,897
Do you think you can do that?

297
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,695
Look.

298
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,573
It's growing fast.

299
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,450
Yeah. It's aging fast.

300
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,619
Days within a matter of minutes.

301
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,038
- You think it's the Ambystoma gene?
- It might be.

302
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,709
The point is, this thing's
gonna die soon anyway.

303
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:36,255
We're gonna get to observe its entire
life-cycle in compressed time.

304
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,632
We'll never get an opportunity
like this again.

305
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,969
So it's dying.

306
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,639
She's dying. All by herself.

307
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,709
Estrogen level's been low these days.

308
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,253
What?

309
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,672
How long?

310
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,092
What are you talking about? What do
you mean, "these days"? Are you sure?

311
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,011
Of course. I did all the tests.

312
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,682
The progesterone, testosterone, estradiol.
It's all in the logs.

313
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:35,355
I'm sorry. I've had a, uh...
I'm a little worn out.

314
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,203
So, uh, I guess that thing...

315
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,749
...that experiment you got going on,
you're still not ready to talk about it?

316
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,547
How do you listen to this crap?
What is this?

317
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:12,017
- What were you saying?
- Nothing.

318
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,487
Day seven.

319
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:28,325
We've got H-50 on a diet of chlorophyll,
roughage, bean curd, and enriched starch.

320
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,745
You're gonna eat this. You're gonna...

321
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,582
Just a little bit, please. Okay?
Come on, just a little. Please.

322
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,043
Just stop. Stop. Just stay still.

323
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,920
She seems resistant to feeding...

324
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,131
...though her rapid growth should
generate a proportionate appetite.

325
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,967
You're gonna eat it. Eat it.

326
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,969
Fuck!

327
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,973
God, I can't take this thing anymore.

328
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,934
This isn't gonna work.

329
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,938
This is impossible.

330
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,119
- Come on.
- Come on.

331
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,371
- Bring it over here.
- Okay.

332
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,957
- Listen, listen.
- Eat this. Eat, just eat it.

333
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,459
- Good girl.
- Good. You're gonna eat that.

334
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,004
Good. See? See?

335
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,132
This isn't gonna work.

336
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,552
She makes too much noise.
People will notice.

337
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,805
- And she stinks.
- We'll just feed her with a drip.

338
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,350
How you gonna feed her with a drip?
She'll rip it right out.

339
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,351
Come on.

340
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,810
Try it.

341
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,200
Tracking her feeding habits,
we've determined...

342
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:38,038
...that the H-50 craves
high-sucrose foodstuffs.

343
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,896
Elsa couldn't make it?

344
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,900
She's at the lab, holding things together.

345
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,405
She's, um, not very happy
with the new directive, is she?

346
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,700
It was our facility.
We were supposed to have autonomy.

347
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:15,909
I know.

348
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,413
And, um, I am sorry.

349
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:30,048
Truth is, if we don't start projecting profits,
big profits, soon...

350
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,758
...Newstead's in serious trouble.

351
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,345
We need capitalization
to move forward...

352
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:39,641
...which means that phase two is
not just an option, it's all we've got.

353
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,437
If Ginger and Fred don't hit a homerun
at the shareholders' presentation...

354
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,814
...we might not even have that.

355
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,025
We won't let you down.

356
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:38,700
In the first month since her birth,
the H-50 continues to evolve rapidly.

357
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,745
Emergence of arms and the closing seam
that bisects her body...

358
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,207
...suggests that she develops
like a fetus outside the womb.

359
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:50,337
Early cognitive recognition tests
indicate growing intelligence.

360
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54,424
Still, her mind remains
her greatest mystery.

361
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,844
Where does it go?

362
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,014
Where does the bear go?

363
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,144
Yep.

364
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,897
That's it. You got it again.

365
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,191
You are such a good girl.

366
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,448
You could do this all day, couldn't you?

367
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,201
Okay. I'm gonna try something harder,
okay?

368
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,578
So really concentrate.

369
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:31,670
E-L-S-A.

370
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,547
E-L-S-A. Elsa.

371
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,216
E-L-S-A.

372
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,759
Show me Elsa.

373
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,973
That's it.

374
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,236
Nerd?

375
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,281
Yeah! I'm a nerd.

376
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,741
Yeah, you made a connection.

377
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:05,579
You are such a good girl. Oh, my God!

378
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,124
She did it. Ha, ha.

379
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,420
What's going on?

380
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,046
She can associate.

381
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,674
Why is the cover off her tail?

382
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,177
What is she doing in this room?
You can't let her out.

383
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,511
What's the problem?

384
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,680
The problem?
Specimens need to be contained.

385
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,933
- Don't call her that.
- What do you want me to call her?

386
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,397
Dren. Dren.

387
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,608
Her name's Dren.

388
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,906
Listen, you're talking to her
like she's a...

389
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,951
You're treating her like a...

390
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,578
A pet.

391
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,124
I'm compiling a developmental profile.
She needs more stimulation than that room.

392
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,751
Oh, well, that's great.

393
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,419
You know what Barlow said?

394
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,297
They're renovating this entire wing,
tomorrow!

395
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,842
So we move her to the storage room
downstairs. Nobody ever goes down there.

396
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,636
How do you know nobody goes there?

397
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,222
- Have you ever?
- Goddamn door.

398
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,891
It's the best idea I've got.
What do you want me to say?

399
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,976
What the hell do you mean by that?

400
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,229
Your sarcasm's gonna help
when we get caught.

401
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,147
We're not gonna get caught.

402
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:18,360
Yeah, breakthroughs come from risk,
and so do people in prison!

403
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,112
They go to jail because of risks!

404
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,658
So you think they're gonna
renovate the storage room?

405
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,494
What, they're gonna install
state-of-the-art mop racks?

406
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,788
All they need to do is open the door.

407
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:37,420
You're gonna risk our career on the fact
that somebody won't open a goddamn door?

408
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,758
It's the best idea I've got, okay?
I mean, what else do you want me to say?

409
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,387
Why are we taking all these risks
all of a sudden? What is going on?

410
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,389
When did you get so fucking scared?

411
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,724
When the fuck did you
stop being a scientist?!

412
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,187
No!

413
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,981
Stop! You go to your place.

414
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,775
Go to your place!

415
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,368
- No, Gavin.
- It's okay.

416
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,578
- Get away from me.
- She's not gonna hurt you.

417
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,713
Okay, so we have to deal with this.

418
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,217
Come on.

419
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,928
All right.

420
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:31,725
It's okay, Dren. It's all right.
It'll just be a minute, all right? Shh, shh.

421
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,436
- I don't know about this.
- You got a better idea?

422
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,063
Go, go, go open the door.

423
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,565
You stop it. Shh.

424
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,326
Starting to feel like a criminal.

425
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,245
Scientists push boundaries.
At least the important ones do.

426
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,124
Sticking to a few rules isn't always
such a bad idea either, you know.

427
00:38:56,292 --> 00:39:00,045
Nobody is gonna care about a few rules
after they see what we have made.

428
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,838
"See what we've made"?

429
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,299
- Is that what you just said?
- Yeah.

430
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,092
Nobody can see what we made.

431
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,429
Once they see Ginger and Fred,
the world will wanna know what's next.

432
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,933
Do you think they could
really look at this face...

433
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,186
...and see anything less than a miracle?

434
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,733
Oh. Oh. Oh, sweetie.

435
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,278
Sweetie, you're sick, oh, no.
Clive, she's really hot.

436
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,035
I've gotta talk to my brother.

437
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:49,052
I know it's crazy,
but I need your support on this.

438
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,223
Do you know what happens
if you get caught?

439
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,894
What am I supposed to do
if you go to jail?

440
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,856
Do you know what happens to this place,
to everyone that depends on you?

441
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:06,069
God, did you ever think about them?
About me?

442
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,367
I mean, did you think at all,
or did you just do what she wanted?

443
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,993
It wasn't like that.

444
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,414
You could have stopped it at any time.

445
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,417
You could have just said no to her.

446
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,838
Try it some time.

447
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,183
It's 105. This is serious.

448
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,895
- You don't know that for sure.
- I know. Okay?

449
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,856
- We have to do something.
- What?

450
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,858
What are we supposed to do?

451
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,694
- Well, we have to take her somewhere.
- What? That's crazy.

452
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,195
Well, then do something!

453
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,948
What?

454
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,201
- Give her a Tylenol?
- Shh.

455
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,705
Come on, we're biochemists,
we can handle this.

456
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,373
How?

457
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,542
Fuck! How?

458
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,920
- What do you do for a fever?
- Cold bath.

459
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,469
Hurry. Hurry!

460
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,889
Come on. Okay, sweetie. Shh.

461
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,223
All right, you got her?

462
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,767
Okay, yeah, I got her. Okay, it's okay.

463
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,314
- Try to be still, okay? I know, I know.
- Aah!

464
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,608
Dren, Dren, you have to settle down,
okay?

465
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,569
- Try to be still.
- It's all right, it's okay.

466
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,573
Jesus, her passages are closing.
She can't breathe. Do something!

467
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,408
- What?
- I don't know!

468
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,035
- A tracheotomy.
- With what?

469
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,244
In the lab.

470
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,372
But there's no time. Look at her!
She's dying!

471
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,249
Dren, try to look at me. Look at me!

472
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,628
Dren! Look right at me. Good girl, good girl.
Look at me, look at me.

473
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:51,591
Now try to breathe. I want you to look
right at me. Dren, look right at me.

474
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:55,094
Try to look at me!
Please, Dren, try to look at me.

475
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,723
What are you doing? Let her go!

476
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,435
Let her go! Stop it! You're killing her.
Let her go!

477
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:09,108
Let her go, please! Clive! Just let her go!
Let her go! Let her go!

478
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,820
Stop it, Clive! Let her go! You're ki...

479
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,239
Stop it!

480
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,283
Please let her go! Please let her go!

481
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,199
She's breathing.

482
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,119
She's breathing.

483
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:06,708
Those weren't tumors.
She has amphibious lungs.

484
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:10,420
You saved her. But how did you know?

485
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,342
You did know, right?

486
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,678
Yeah.

487
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,225
Anyway...

488
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:29,689
We can't mess around anymore.
We have to clean this place up, make it safe.

489
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,775
Yeah.

490
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,695
Yeah, I think we can do that.

491
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:44,537
Sweetie, you have been
such a good girl lately.

492
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,956
I have something special for you.

493
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,546
Hi. I'm Jenny.

494
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,425
I like cute guys, fast cars,
and funny little creatures like you.

495
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,054
She was my secret friend.

496
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:06,726
I wasn't allowed to have her,
so I had to keep her hidden, just like you.

497
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,030
Good night, sweetie.

498
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,603
She's had a big day.
She's gonna be out like a light.

499
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,572
It's been a long time.

500
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,618
My God, I didn't even notice.
Is that what happens?

501
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,788
- To couples when they...
- When they work too hard? Ha, ha.

502
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,208
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

503
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,379
Hi there.

504
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,172
Hey.

505
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,973
What do we have here?

506
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,143
All right.

507
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,146
We have to be quiet.

508
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,154
L... We don't have any, uh...

509
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,031
What's the worst that could happen?

510
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,003
Shit.

511
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:45,259
Here is a couple unlike any other
we've seen before.

512
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,056
That they are completely unique
in the world...

513
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,308
...is more than just fate...

514
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,769
...more than just luck.

515
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,230
It is by design.

516
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:11,577
Now let me present to you the minds
behind the design.

517
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,581
Splice masters extraordinaire...

518
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:19,126
...Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast!

519
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,301
Thank you. Ahem.

520
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,761
Thank you very much.

521
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,388
Thank you.

522
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,433
There's been a lot of talk tonight...

523
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,770
...about advancements in, uh,
multispecies morphogens.

524
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,648
We've talked about our new
protein-based compounds...

525
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,734
...disease-fighting agents for livestock.

526
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,654
And that's all very exciting
for everyone at Newstead.

527
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,573
But let's be honest.

528
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,284
What's exciting for you people
here tonight...

529
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:56,122
...is to see these two creatures,
alive and in the flesh.

530
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:04,046
These are state-of-the-art designer
organisms, the first of their kind.

531
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,133
The origin of a species.

532
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,552
Male and female.

533
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,138
- Like Adam and Eve...
- Raise the barrier.

534
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:16,601
...coming together to enact nature's
timeless story of love.

535
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,826
Do something.

536
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,104
Uh...

537
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:19,205
Well, I think we have to agree that
this is a setback in terms of how...

538
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,123
It's a fucking disaster.

539
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,584
What happened?

540
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:29,715
Well, it was difficult to examine
the remains...

541
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:35,888
...but it seems that Ginger
has undergone certain...

542
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,431
Hormonal changes.

543
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,558
Hormonal changes?

544
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,560
She turned into a male.

545
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,568
What? Just like that? Just changed sex?

546
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,238
But how can this happen?

547
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:56,117
We really don't know...

548
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:59,870
...but clearly, two males caged together
and stressed is a...

549
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:05,251
So your first living hybrid changes sex,
and you didn't notice?

550
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,003
How is that possible?

551
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,422
We can re-create them.
No reason not to start over.

552
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,219
No more monsters.

553
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,639
We don't have time for that.

554
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:25,104
We need the gene that produces CD356,
and we need it now.

555
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,481
Do you understand?

556
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,904
- We have to get it out of here.
- Yeah, and take her where?

557
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:37,616
Barlow's taking over every inch
of this place, man. He'll find it.

558
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,119
Gotta find some place,
like, away from everything.

559
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,871
What am I not getting here?

560
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,707
What did you expect when you made it?
Didn't you have a plan?

561
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,959
Listen, brother,
we wouldn't be in this mess...

562
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:50,463
...if you'd been paying enough attention
to observe a fucking gender change!

563
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,964
And where were you, maestro?

564
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,051
I was playing catch-up with
all the work you weren't doing!

565
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,720
- I know a place.
- All you had to do was track data...

566
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,472
I know a place we can take her.

567
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,523
All these years you've owned this farm,
and you never mentioned it?

568
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:13,069
- You knew I grew up on a farm.
- Yeah, I didn't know you still had it.

569
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:16,572
It's not my farm. It was hers.

570
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,992
- She's dead.
- So is the farm.

571
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:36,467
It's all right, sweetie.
We'll have you out in a minute, okay?

572
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,268
You know, you can talk to me
about your mother.

573
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,562
I don't even want to think about her.

574
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,231
I just want to understand.

575
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,859
If you could understand crazy,
it wouldn't be crazy.

576
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,560
It's okay, honey.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

577
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,062
This is your new home now.

578
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,649
This is your new home.

579
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,901
Come on. It's okay.

580
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,405
- No, no.
- What is it? What is it? Come on.

581
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:42,449
- It's just a barn.
- Dren. It's all right. Dren.

582
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,951
Come with us.

583
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:48,914
Dren!

584
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,459
Dren!

585
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,253
Dren!

586
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,840
Everything's fine.
Everything's under control, huh?

587
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,216
Is it really under control now?

588
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:02,428
Okay, you know what? I need you
to calm down. We just need to focus.

589
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,598
Unbelievable. This is the disaster
everyone warns about.

590
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:08,017
A new species set loose in the world.

591
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,769
Don't worry, all right?
She's not gonna leave us.

592
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,104
- She just did.
- Okay.

593
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,524
You know what? We're gonna find her.
She's not gonna go far. Shh, shh, shh.

594
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,279
Where is it?

595
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,242
Go, go, go.

596
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,414
Dren?

597
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,213
Dren?

598
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,387
- Dren, honey?
- I think she's hurt.

599
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,143
Oh, Dren.

600
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,815
Ugh.

601
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,529
Ah.

602
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,411
It's almost full.

603
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:15,834
Dren...

604
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,213
...you must never, ever run off
on me like that again.

605
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,547
Do you understand?

606
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:24,426
Do you understand? Dren, look at me.
That was bad.

607
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,178
Bad Dren!

608
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,225
Look, I'm...

609
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:36,188
I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm not angry at you.
I was just... I was really worried.

610
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:46,031
Well, it ain't the W,
but it's got a kind of rustic charm.

611
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,784
You okay, Dren?

612
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,245
Got a little blanket for you.

613
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,664
Aah!

614
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,875
Dren!

615
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,215
Maybe we should move her
into the house.

616
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,218
No way. Come on,
someone's gonna see her there.

617
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,179
No, that's fine.
She needs a place to be in water.

618
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,683
She's just upset. Everything's new.

619
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,352
It'll be okay.

620
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:20,232
Come on, let's move in. It's late.
Okay? Come on.

621
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,865
You okay?

622
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,076
Yeah, of course. It's just a house.

623
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,951
- This was your room?
- Mm-hm.

624
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:16,622
I thought you said your mom left it
just the way it was.

625
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,541
She did.

626
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,686
Nice of you to show up.

627
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,438
Traffic.

628
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:44,858
You will observe protocol. It's the only way
we're gonna beat this thing.

629
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:49,238
Thank you. Shall we, um, get to work?

630
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,806
Please, honey, not today.
Eat your dinner, okay?

631
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,809
She doesn't like that stuff.
Maybe she wants meat.

632
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,894
She doesn't eat meat.

633
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,147
I'm sorry, is rabbit considered
a vegetable?

634
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,316
That was an accident.

635
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:36,446
Come on. Honey. I know you're hungry.

636
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:37,906
Eat your di...

637
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,866
What is it?

638
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,077
What's the matter? What?

639
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,163
Tedi... She spelled "tedious."

640
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:51,753
- Where would she get a word like that?
- I don't know.

641
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,506
She's telling us she's bored.
She's been stuck here a week.

642
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,341
Do you want to play a game, sweetie?

643
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,102
Holy shit. How did you...?

644
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:11,523
Dren, I know, but I'm sorry, you can't
go outside. You know, you just can't.

645
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,028
- Dren! No, Dren! Stop it!
- Hey, cut it out.

646
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,696
Dren, stop it!

647
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,531
Dren, okay, take it easy.

648
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,951
- Okay, hey.
- You know what?

649
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,746
That's it. You come over here
right now and sit down!

650
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:28,206
- Elsa! Cool it.
- Sit down!

651
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,042
- You saw what she did!
- Come on.

652
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,169
Did you not see what she did? Fuck!

653
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,921
I did. Stop, it's okay. It's okay.

654
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,215
- It's done.
- She's getting so hard to control...

655
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,595
Dren, stop!

656
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,855
Be careful.

657
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,279
- Dren?
- Dren?

658
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:03,659
Dren?

659
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,748
- Dren?
- Dren?

660
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,083
Dren, come back here!

661
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,918
Dren, sweetie?

662
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:16,630
Come on, sweetie. Come back inside.

663
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,632
Dren, we're not angry.

664
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:25,597
- Dren, get back here this instant!
- Watch it, watch it, watch...

665
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,183
- No!
- No!

666
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,621
Dren! Dren, don't, don't. We need you.

667
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,123
Dren...

668
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,625
...we love you.

669
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,638
Come here.

670
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,991
Elsa not here yet?

671
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,367
Not feeling well.

672
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,828
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

673
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,581
People get sick. It happens.

674
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:36,084
A lot of people would just
suck it up, you know, rise to the occasion?

675
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:40,589
You guys are not some special case,
not anymore.

676
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,925
Fucking idiot.

677
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,972
My mother wouldn't let me wear makeup.

678
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,391
She said that it debased women.

679
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,855
But who doesn't wanna be debased
every once in a while?

680
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,107
Look.

681
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,987
You see how pretty you've become?

682
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,200
You're gonna have to learn
how to be a grownup.

683
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,370
I remember how I felt at your age.

684
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:15,832
It's an exciting time.

685
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,629
I never thought it...

686
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,593
Maybe we could use some, uh,
more eyeliner, hmm?

687
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,054
Let's try some more eyeliner.

688
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,227
What are these?

689
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,188
Did you do these?

690
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:43,068
These are really good.

691
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,070
Are there any of me?

692
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:04,631
Dren, what is that?
Where did you get that?

693
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,091
Give it to me.

694
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,928
Give it to me, right now.
Dren, you give that to me.

695
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,431
Sorry. You can't keep her.

696
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,642
We can't take a chance.
It could make you sick.

697
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,113
Can't always get what you want.

698
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,448
That's a part of growing up too.

699
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,220
Elsa?

700
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:18,288
Dren?

701
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,834
Shit.

702
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,881
Hey. What's the matter, girl?

703
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,429
What happened?

704
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:37,974
Did Elsa do that?

705
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,144
Looks nice.

706
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:49,527
Well, let's lighten things up around here,
shall we?

707
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:56,076
That's good. That's really good.

708
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,420
Ah. Ha, ha.

709
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,967
You like that?

710
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,677
It's music.

711
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:22,060
It's fun, huh? Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

712
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,062
It's music.

713
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:27,941
Come on, it's just music. Feel that?
It makes you feel good.

714
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:33,071
Feels better. Yeah, yeah. Let it out.
Good. Come on, come on.

715
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,700
Good. Very good. Good.

716
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:39,411
That's dancing.
Okay, that's kind of a dance.

717
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:44,958
Okay, look, look, look. Look at my feet.
Watch my feet. The feet.

718
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:48,503
Okay, ready, one...
Look, you're doing good.

719
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,047
Step, step.

720
01:06:56,429 --> 01:07:00,640
Very good. Ooh, look at you. I knew we got
the dance gene in there somewhere.

721
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,893
Give me your hand. Hold my hand.

722
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:06,813
Good.

723
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:13,028
That's nice. Okay, hand there.
Put it here. Very good.

724
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,780
Okay, I'm gonna lead, okay?
I'm the man, I lead.

725
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:18,616
The man leads, okay?
So back up, back up, one more.

726
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:22,787
One, that's it, that's it. Good, good, good.
That's it, one more.

727
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,748
Good. Back up, back up, good.

728
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:29,002
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, turn this side.
Okay, good, back up, back up. Okay.

729
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,797
You're a good dancer.

730
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,386
You're very good.

731
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,389
Look at you.

732
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,335
Elsa.

733
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:14,672
That's enough.
That's enough dancing, Dren.

734
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:20,053
Good night.

735
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:40,365
Thought I was taking a quick nap.

736
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:45,829
I must have slept like a rock.

737
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,208
What?

738
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:54,712
It's your DNA.

739
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:56,714
What?

740
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:00,510
In Dren.

741
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,429
I can tell.

742
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,808
You put yourself into the experiment?

743
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:09,894
How could you...? Ha, ha.

744
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:15,316
What...? What were you...?
I mean, was this ever about science?

745
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,068
Of course it was. It still is.

746
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:23,408
If you believe that, you're even more
fucked up than I think you are.

747
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:26,119
Uh, what is that supposed to mean?

748
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:29,789
Maybe you ought to take another look
at your family history.

749
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:51,436
Dren?

750
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,272
Dren?

751
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,662
Hey, Dren.

752
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,291
I have something for you. Come here.

753
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,297
Come here. I wanna give you something.

754
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,936
Can't you smile for me?

755
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:37,482
You know I love you, don't you?

756
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,154
You're a part of me.

757
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:47,450
And I'm a part of you.

758
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:51,955
I'm inside you.

759
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,500
I have something for you.

760
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:03,007
Look what I got.

761
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:04,759
You can keep her.

762
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,512
Why not?

763
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:09,931
It's nice to have a pet.

764
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,023
Oh, my God!

765
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,566
Dren!

766
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,397
Physically, H-50 has evolved well.

767
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,524
However...

768
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:05,570
...recent violent behavior suggests
dangerous psychological developments.

769
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:11,784
Erratic behavior may be caused by
a disproportionate species identification.

770
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:16,205
Cosmetically human affectation
should be eliminated wherever possible.

771
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:30,405
Due to her unstable condition,
it has become necessary...

772
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,574
...to remove her zootoxin glands
and stinger.

773
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:25,001
- What are you doing?
- What I had to.

774
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,883
Jesus Christ. Elsa.

775
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:37,597
She's become unstable. She killed the cat.
She almost killed me.

776
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:40,641
So you cut off her tail?

777
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,478
You any closer to finding the protein?

778
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:46,397
What does that have to do
with anything?

779
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:50,818
You haven't, because you're working with
tissue that's been dead too long.

780
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:53,779
- You don't know she has it.
- Of course she does.

781
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:56,991
She has everything Ginger and Fred
had and more.

782
01:14:58,076 --> 01:14:59,410
Where are you going?

783
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:04,415
I'm gonna solve this thing.
I'm gonna put things right.

784
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:20,473
I'm sorry.

785
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:23,476
Dren.

786
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:29,607
Dren, I'm...

787
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,670
Where are you?

788
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,752
Bill, you're early.

789
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:15,046
Let me get this straight.

790
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:19,216
You stay home because you're sick,
and now I find you sneaking around.

791
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:21,719
- Making up for lost time.
- It's too late for that.

792
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:24,472
They won't extend the deadline. It's over.

793
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,057
You screwed us all.

794
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,477
- In fact, clear out Clive's desk.
- I don't think so.

795
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,063
Well, no one cares
what you think anymore.

796
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:34,273
You're an embarrassment
to this company. It's...

797
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:36,275
The protein's been synthesized.

798
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:38,444
It's in the fridge.

799
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:42,573
When some real scientists get here,
have them take a look.

800
01:17:58,423 --> 01:17:59,924
Ouch.

801
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:21,112
Elsa?

802
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:35,000
No, no! No!

803
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:38,129
No. You can't do that. You...

804
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:48,055
You shouldn't do that.

805
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:57,022
You shouldn't do that.

806
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,852
Oh, God.

807
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,198
Oh, shit.

808
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,522
- EI.
- Don't.

809
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:45,441
Don't.

810
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:15,763
I don't even quite know how it happened.
I was barely...

811
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,098
I don't even know who you are anymore.

812
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,060
You've become something sick.

813
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:26,899
Forget about what it means to me,
there are some things you do not do!

814
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:29,818
We changed the rules.

815
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:33,030
You're not talking your way out of this.

816
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:40,329
We crossed a line
and things got confused.

817
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,623
Confused about what?

818
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,043
Right and wrong.

819
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:48,796
Right and wrong.

820
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:52,716
Do you have any idea how
naive that sounds?

821
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:56,428
You're in no position to talk to me
about right and wrong!

822
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:59,056
And you are?

823
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:01,100
Really?

824
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:05,854
Why the fuck did you wanna make her
in the first place?

825
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:07,773
Huh?

826
01:23:08,191 --> 01:23:10,234
For the betterment of mankind?

827
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,409
You never wanted a normal child...

828
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:22,246
...because you were afraid
of losing control.

829
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:28,544
But an experiment, that's something else.

830
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:31,880
I love her.

831
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:35,342
Yeah, I know, but we fucked up, EI.

832
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:40,597
We fucked up.

833
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:46,854
Jesus Christ. We've chained her up.
We locked her away from the world.

834
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:49,440
We maimed her.

835
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,944
I maimed her.

836
01:23:56,781 --> 01:24:00,242
I just wish things could go back
to the way they were.

837
01:24:13,673 --> 01:24:16,133
I synthesized the protein.

838
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:19,678
What?

839
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:21,472
She has a derivative.

840
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:25,267
It's more stable than CD356.

841
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:28,687
It's 10 times higher than the level
Ginger and Fred ever had.

842
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:43,994
We could maybe save things.

843
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:48,332
I don't mean us. I mean...

844
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,377
Oh, God, we can't do that.

845
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,172
We can't. We have a responsibility.

846
01:24:57,550 --> 01:24:59,802
Experiment's over.

847
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:03,847
Our responsibility is to end it.

848
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,865
Dren?

849
01:25:24,035 --> 01:25:25,619
Dren?

850
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:29,456
Come out, Dren.

851
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:40,551
Dren?

852
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:06,076
- Clive!
- What?

853
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:13,292
What's happening?

854
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:19,423
I don't know, but she's dying.

855
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:08,430
Do you, uh...

856
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:11,475
...wanna say anything?

857
01:28:23,756 --> 01:28:25,841
- Almost done?
- Yeah, almost.

858
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,682
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

859
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:53,327
What...? Gavin, what are you doing here?

860
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:55,704
I'm sorry. I had to.

861
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:57,914
It's the only way.

862
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:04,755
All right. Let's see it.

863
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:07,799
- What did you tell him?
- I didn't have to tell him much.

864
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:09,593
You think I'm stupid?

865
01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:12,888
The samples you gave me
had human DNA content.

866
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:16,141
They didn't come from Ginger and Fred,
they came from something else...

867
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,018
...something that's still alive.

868
01:29:19,103 --> 01:29:21,104
And to think you did this on my watch.

869
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:24,232
Now, let's see this thing.

870
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,525
It doesn't belong to you.

871
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:27,277
It doesn't belong to anyone.

872
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:28,904
Where is it?

873
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:42,959
Fine.

874
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:44,628
I'm calling a forensic team.

875
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,296
She's already dead.

876
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:49,132
It's over.

877
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,138
- I don't believe you.
- No?

878
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,892
Well, see for yourself.
She's buried behind the barn.

879
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:15,158
Oh, shit.

880
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:27,421
What the fuck is going on?

881
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:31,550
Dren?

882
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:49,276
Gavin!

883
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,280
Gavin!

884
01:30:54,198 --> 01:30:56,491
Gav! Gavin!

885
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:59,244
Aah. Gavin!

886
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:01,955
Clive, stop!

887
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:06,042
- Shit.
- We have to go back!

888
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:08,462
- Gavin?
- We have to go back.

889
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:11,256
Clive, Clive, Clive.

890
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:13,717
- I can't, I have to... I can't.
- Look, he's gone.

891
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:17,179
No, look, we can't stay here, okay?
It's out there.

892
01:31:17,346 --> 01:31:18,430
What happened?

893
01:31:19,098 --> 01:31:22,142
Ginger. It's the same thing that
happened with Fred and Ginger.

894
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,728
- Okay, now, let's go.
- I'm not leaving my brother.

895
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:26,563
He's dead, okay? He's already dead!

896
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:29,065
- I'm not leaving my brother!
- Let's go!

897
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:31,902
No!

898
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:34,905
- Just let it go.
- We need it.

899
01:31:35,072 --> 01:31:37,199
- Clive, let it go!
- We need it. Aah!

900
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:39,826
We gotta go.

901
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:42,329
Almost.

902
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:45,248
Almost have it.

903
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:52,964
I got it!

904
01:31:56,928 --> 01:31:59,930
Clive! Clive! Clive!

905
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,183
Clive!

906
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:06,144
Clive.

907
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:15,654
Clive.

908
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:20,450
Grab my hand. Grab my...

909
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:33,630
Okay, okay, now, get up, because
we need to go now. We need to go.

910
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:36,174
I know, it's okay. Okay. Okay.

911
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:20,028
What do you want?

912
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:21,738
What do you want?

913
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:31,122
Inside...

914
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:36,753
...you.

915
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:23,461
Your Dren turned out to be...

916
01:37:23,629 --> 01:37:27,340
...a cauldron of unimaginable
chemical mysteries.

917
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:35,306
Aside from the intense concentration
of CD356 in her system...

918
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:41,312
...she was filled with a variety
of completely unique compounds.

919
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:45,233
We'll be filing patents for years.

920
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:51,155
Of course, we are extremely excited...

921
01:37:51,323 --> 01:37:55,076
...that you're willing to take us
to the next stage...

922
01:37:55,452 --> 01:37:59,789
...especially in light of the...

923
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,500
...personal risk.

924
01:38:05,504 --> 01:38:11,342
We think the figure we've come up with
is very generous.

925
01:38:20,227 --> 01:38:22,729
You can never speak of this...

926
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:27,775
...to anyone...

927
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:32,447
...ever.

928
01:39:01,727 --> 01:39:05,271
Nobody would blame you
if you didn't do this.

929
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:10,526
You could just put an end to it
and walk away.

930
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:14,989
What's the worst that could happen?
