Easy, easy!

167
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,746
Yeah, if this doesn't
prove us dogs rule--

168
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:38,716
what does?

169
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:08,078
But I've seen them.
We can't do this
every time.

170
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,184
You're just wrong.

171
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:53,257
( laughing continues )

172
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,433
Yeah... yeah, we do.

173
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:07,938
And we're gonna keep them.
Come on, let's go.

174
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:27,892
Balto!

175
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,089
    Both:
The bush plane!

176
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:49,673
Oy! Ow! Ohh!

177
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,812
I must get help.

178
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:03,988
( grunts )

179
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,576
I thought the difference is
    only one has a heart.

180
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,451
Who's coming with me?

181
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,600
Dad, wait!

182
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,542
And it served him right,
the stinker.

183
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,157
What?

184
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,286
in that funny way
on his neck-- you know?

185
00:55:54,251 --> 00:55:56,086
Wish me luck, boys!

186
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,565
( screams )

187
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:29,519
    Come on,
let's get going.

188
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:49,239
    They'll be looking
for that bush plane for weeks.

189
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,143
    Listen, if anyone
can find him, Balto can.

190
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,852
Yeah, Mom.

191
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:36,920
( sighs )
I should have gone
with Balto.

192
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:44,661
( wind moaning )

193
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:53,003
Oh, he's probably griping about
what's taking us so long.

194
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,243
Onward.

195

Help, Stella-aaa!

- Help!
- Quick, grab my leg.

207
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:07,571
What was I thinking?

208
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:09,940
( groans )

209
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,345
Hang on, Balto.

Hurry!

211

I'm not sure
that's what I want to be.

he's found him!

You owe me an apology!
