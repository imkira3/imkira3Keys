I mean, these soldiers, they're probably

171
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,313
some sort of flash mob.
What are they gonna sing, "Thriller"?

172
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
That would be great.

174
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,318
I could continue to destroy your realm.

175
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,271
I have untold legions
that will die for my cause,

176
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,959
but I offer an end
to the bloodshed permanently.

177
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,753
You and I will travel to the Elder Gods.

178
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,996
Petition them for another tournament.

179
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,318
The final Mortal Kombat.

180
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,597
Listen, shithead, if you think Raiden's
going to agree to another tournament

181
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,752
after we just kicked your ass
on that whacked-out island of yours,

182
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,717
you're an even bigger idiot
than I thought.

183
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,599
We got another 1000 years before
that has to happen again.

184
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
Agreed.

185
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,989
I'm sorry.
Uh, maybe it's being kicked in the head

186
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,520
by assholes from another dimension.

187
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,915
But I thought you said "agreed."

188
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
I did.

189
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,714
You can't be serious.

190
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,516
We're holding them off
on various fronts.

191
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,434
- We can win this.
- And then?

192
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,919
We may win for a time.

193
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,597
But Outworld is a place
of vast resources.

194
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,676
He will return to his throne,
rebuild his army and attack again.

195
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,800
Why place the responsibility of survival

196
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,590
on your children's children
when we can do something about it now?

197
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,030
We should discuss this.

198
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,520
No, I have made my decision.

199
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,511
If we have a chance
to end this now, we must.

200

- It's not fair.
- It rarely is.

But such is life.

202
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,479
I accept your offer.

203
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,596
Then we shall go to the Elder Gods
and petition them together.

204
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,156
- Be careful.
- And you, all of you.

You have a lot to live up to.

it has something I need.

It was with you
when you perished on the island.

That type of magic
is not so easily destroyed.

My soldiers will escort you
to Earthrealm to the Temple of Elements.

You will open the gates
and bring me what's inside.

Then my brothers and sisters
will see how mad I really am.

It will take the combined might
of the Lin Kuei and even then...

255
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,989
Our target is a member

The Shirai Ryu are dead.

But I'm afraid one remains,
Hanzo Hasashi, Scorpion.

Where? I will find him, Grandmaster.

260
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,190
I will find him and kill him
for my clan, for my brother.

No, he's to be taken alive.

- You look...
- I am fine, Liu Kang.

346
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,920
The Elder Gods have agreed
to our request.

347
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,152
A final tournament that will determine

348
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,837
not just the future of our realm,
but the others as well.

349

A tournament? Like, what,
karate tournament?

It's a whole thing. I'll explain later.

351

We must journey to Outworld
and defeat Shao Kahn's

and countless lives.

Never mind. That sums it up.

354
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,033
We won't let you down, Lord Raiden.

355
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,270
I hope not.

356
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,110
Because I will be fighting
alongside you.

00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,713

What are we gasping in horror at?

361
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,550
I have relinquished my godhood
to compete in the tournament.

362
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,960
But without your godhood...

363
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,435
I'm still a warrior, Liu Kang.

364

Where do you think the
Wu Shi learn their techniques?

365
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,317
Lord Raiden, I am more than capable.

It was surprisingly easy.

I am sure Shinnok
would like it to appear so.

Why are you here?

385
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,474
The key from Shang Tsung's island.

Shinnok says its magic
is intertwined with my soul, so...

You are the only one who can
open the door to the last Kamidogu.
