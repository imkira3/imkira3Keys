2
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,900
I'm refreshed.

3
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,600
I'm refreshing.

4
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,000
Welcome back. I'm Bryant Gumbel.

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,800
- And I'm Anne Howard.
- Good stuff today.

6
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,300
- We're going to be busy.
- We've got pop superstar Elton John.

7
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
He's going to be with us.

8
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,300
And so, too,
will best-selling author Al Franken.

9
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,200
Along with some
super-smart fourth graders...

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,000
with a great idea
for getting schoolbooks...

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,400
to kids who really need them.

12
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,900
But here's an idea
whose time has come.

13
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,800
Why don't we just start with...

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,100
... and fill the tart shell.

15
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,600
Bryant, you put some ice cream
on our angel food cake...

16
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,400
- How much do you want?
- As much as you like.

17
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,900
What are you laughing about?
This is Baked Alaska.

18
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,300
- This is supposed to be low-fat.
- It is!

19
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,700
Did they call?

20
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,100
Someone from the show.
The Gumbel show. They didn't call?

21
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,300
Are you sure?

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
- Once again, we're out of time.
- Thank you. Already?

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,000
We still got lots more ahead
this morning. We're going to be back...

24
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,000
- What's up, dude?
- Next person in line.

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,100
What's up?

26
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,300
- Hey, can I get your autograph?
- Next in line.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm not who you think I am, so...

28
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,200
You're not the weather guy?

29
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,700
Dan Spritz?

30
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,900
Dave Spritz.

31
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,800
I'm not Dave Spritz, no.
But I hear that a lot.

32
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
You don't have to be a dick.

33
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,100
Look, can you just...
All right, I'm just waiting in line.

34
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,500
Bro, I can read
your vehicle registration form.

35
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,700
So, whatever.

36
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,900
Can you...

37
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,700
All right, can you give me a break?
I just wanted to wait in line.

38
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,600
You're on TV, bro.

39
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,900
You're on TV.

40
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,100
- You're on TV, bro.
- So what? You keep saying that.

41
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,300
So you're on TV, bro.

42
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,600
Go work in a bank or something...

43
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,900
if you don't wanna be cool to people.

44
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,900
Whatever. Just...
Can you get out of my face?

45
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,300
Can you get out of my face?

46
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,100
- Asshole.
- You want to say that to my face?

47
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,000
I thought you wanted me
to get out of your face.

48
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,900
People recognize me sometimes.

49
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,700
Some are dicks.

50
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,200
This is the same system that created
those strong snowfalls in Minnesota.

51
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,700
It's meant some
slightly warmer weather...

52
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,900
I should cool out a little, I guess.

53
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,500
I mean, I'm not just this
two-dimensional guy they recognize.

54
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,700
I do have a relationship to them.

55
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I let them know
what they have to deal with.

56
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,300
But listen, these warmer temperatures
are not going to last.

57
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,500
This wind system will keep pushing
colder air across the Midwest...

58
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,600
I guess that's why
they think they know me.

59
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,900
But they don't, really.

60
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,900
...our Spritz Nipper of the week
with a high of just 24.

61
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,500
I'm not a hill of beans.

62
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,900
I have a plan.

63
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,700
Okay, see you then.

64
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,800
- What's this afternoon?
- You're picking up Shelly.

65
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,400
- Where?
- Chicago Dance.

66
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,100
Then you're taking your dad
to Northwestern.

67
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,100
At 3:00?

68
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Do you have that Hello America stuff?

69
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,100
- The letter?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,300
You have Mike, too.
5:30 at the Norris house.

71
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Okay.

72
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,700
Do they have my cell phone?

73
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,900
Well, they should have
all the numbers in case.

74
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,700
And am I supposed to call
that guy Dersen?

75
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Didn't he want me to call to touch base?

76
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,800
Okay.

77
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,100
- Dad, can we stop here?
- What for?

78
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,100
I need a notebook for school.

79
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,900
I'll just walk home.

80
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Okay.

81
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,500
- Can I have some money?
- You don't have any?

82
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,600
No.

83
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,700
You're 12 years old.

84
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,100
You shouldn't be walking around
without money, okay, Shelly?

85
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,500
You're not a kid.

86
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,900
- How's your mom doing?
- She's good.

87
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,300
Can I have a pack of Lights?

88
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,500
- Regulars?
- The 100s.

89
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,600
Strikes?

90
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,800
How's Shelly?

91
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,200
She's doing great.

92
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,500
- Little angel.
- Yeah.

93
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
She's doing great.

94
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
- Who's an angel?
- Shelly.

95
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,400
Shelly is grossly overweight
and unhappy.

96
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,700
I'm concerned about her,
as I am Michael.

97
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,500
- David.
- Yeah, Dad.

98
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,100
Robert Spritzel?

99
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Would you get me a paper...

100
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,300
- for the way back, Son?
- Yeah.

101
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,400
Fifteen minutes?

102
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,700
Yes. I'll see you then.

103
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,700
Fuck.

104
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,700
- Hey.
- Hey.

105
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,900
- It's getting cold.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,100
- What's the Nipper this week?
- Thursday.

107
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,000
Thursday's the Nipper? All right.

108
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,100
Here.

109
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,900
Yeah, can I get some change?

110
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,600
Not really.

111
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,500
Can I just get some quarters?
I just need a quarter for a paper.

112
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,700
Not really.

113
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,700
All right. I'll get something then.

114
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,600
All right.

115
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,700
Small coffee.

116
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,900
It's 80 cents.

117
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,400
No, it says $0.72.

118
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,400
After the whole everything, it's $0.80.

119
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,900
- Hey.
- Hi.

120
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,900
Where's the paper, David?

121
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
I didn't have enough money.

122
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,900
You bought a coffee.

123
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,000
- What?
- You bought a coffee.

124
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Yeah, that, and then I didn't have
enough money after.

125
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
What?

126
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,300
I didn't have enough money
after I bought the coffee, so...

127
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
You should carry more than $1, David.

128
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,500
You're a grown man.

129
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,200
Let me just move this letter
from Hello America.

130
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,600
My father is Robert King Spritzel.

131
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,100
He won the National Book Award
when he was 28.

132
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,400
And the Pulitzer when he was 33.

133
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,000
President Carter called him
a national treasure.

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,400
They played racquetball
in a regular game.

135
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,000
He was a great writer.

136
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,000
But what was the cost?

137
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,700
Did he neglect his family?

138
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,000
No, he didn't.

139
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,200
He was a fine father.

140
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,500
More than that, really.

141
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,600
It's fruitless for Shelly to be dancing.

142
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,300
She should find another interest
that would be more rewarding to her...

143
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,500
that she can take more from, David.

144
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,900
- We've talked about that.
- Well, you should do something, Son.

145
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,000
We've tried a couple things.
We'll keep trying, so...

146
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,200
How's Michael?

147
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,800
I think that was an overreaction
on Noreen's part.

148
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,900
I don't think he has a problem with pot.

149
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,100
Let's hope.

150
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
How's the weather business?

151
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,100
Last September...

152
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,900
I had encouraged Shelly to explore
some other activities and interests.

153
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,300
She picked archery.

154
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,900
So I took her to an archery range
in Bolingbrook.

155
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,900
It was a 90-minute drive.

156
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,500
We purchased a junior bow-arrow kit...

157
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,700
and a leather wrist/forearm guard.

158
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,900
Okay, we'll take that.

159
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,300
And private lessons.

160
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,000
All right, Shelly.

161
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,400
You take that one...

162
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,500
and go right ahead.

163
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,200
All right. Okay, just remember...

164
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,300
pull it straight back,
parallel to your ear, okay?

165
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,300
You can do it, Shelly.

166
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,100
We purchased a five-pack lesson plan.

167
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,700
We haven't been back.

168
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,100
Hello?

169
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

170
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Can you pick up Mike
at the mall on North?

171
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,500
I thought he was at a friend's house.
Paul Norris.

172
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,600
They went to the mall.
He just called me.

173
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,900
- He finished his rehab.
- Okay.

174
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,400
- That's one of my counselors.
- In your program?

175
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,700
Don Boden. He's pretty nice.

176
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,600
- He swears all the time, though.
- Swears?

177
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,500
Yeah. To relate, I guess.
But he's pretty nice.

178
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,700
Hey, Don.

179
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,500
- What are you guys doing?
- Looking for clothes.

180
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,800
You're just looking for clothes.

181
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,700
- Yeah.
- That's great.

182
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,300
I'm looking for clothes.

183
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,200
Okay.

184
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,900
- This is Paul.
- What's up?

185
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Hey.

186
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,900
It's cold today.

187
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no kidding.

188
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,400
What is it, like, 20 or something?

189
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,900
Yeah, like 22.

190
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,100
Yeah. Fuck.

191
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah.

192
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,600
Hey.

193
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,300
- Yeah, I like this.
- It's good-looking.

194
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Yeah, I've been looking
for something like this.

195
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,700
Chuck it in here.

196
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,300
- What?
- Chuck it in.

197
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm loading up. I got a discount card.
I'll get it for you.

198
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,900
- That's all right.
- Mike, big deal.

199
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,600
- I can get it.
- Bro, I got a serious discount.

200
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
It's gonna cost, like, $7.

201
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,700
- I'm gonna take off. Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

202
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,200
That's my dad. I'll see you later.

203
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,800
Sure. I'll catch you later.

204
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

205
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,900
- Who's that?
- Don Boden.

206
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,700
- Who's Don Boden?
- He's one of my counselors.

207
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Oh.

208
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,100
- That's a nice sweater.
- Thanks.

209
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,900
I'll walk you up.

210
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,300
Hi.

211
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,800
Hi. Thanks for getting Mike.

212
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,000
- Hey, how was your thing?
- It was good.

213
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,900
- I'll see you, Dad.
- Okay, Mike.

214
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,700
- I think he's gonna be okay.
- Well, we'll see.

215
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,700
What's new?

216
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,200
Nothing much.

217
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,500
I got a feeler from Hello America.

218
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,600
- What?
- I got a feeler.

219
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,200
Dales is leaving it.
I might get called to audition.

220
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,500
New York.

221
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,700
- Lf I get called.
- That's good.

222
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,600
What about the kids?

223
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,300
It's just a shot in the dark, that's all.

224
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,000
Well, thanks for getting Mike.

225
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,900
I had to take my dad
to Northwestern for a test...

226
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,000
so I was right there, anyway.

227
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,900
- Oh, is he okay?
- I think so. It was just a test.

228
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,300
Noreen!

229
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,800
Are you okay?

230
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,100
Yeah.

231
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,800
Fuck! What are you doing?

232
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,800
I was just... You turned into it.

233
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,000
I think you cracked the glass.

234
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,200
So do you have everything you need?

235
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,600
Yeah, we got everything.

236
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,500
We'll pare it down to three applicants
after we watch the tapes.

237
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,700
- We'll call if you're one, Dave.
- Okay, Mark.

238
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,400
It's nice to make your acquaintance.

239
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,800
- You, too. Take care.
- Hey, weatherman!

240
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,900
All right. Bye.

241
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,800
Fuck!

242
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,800
Fuck.

243
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
David?

244
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,700
Hey.

245
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,000
- What happened?
- I got hit with a Frosty.

246
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,100
- Why?
- What?

247
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,000
Why did you get hit with a Frosty?
What is a Frosty?

248
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,500
A Frosty is a shake from Wendy's.

249
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,800
Why would someone throw
a shake at you?

250
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,000
- That happens sometimes.
- People throw shakes at you?

251
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,500
Stuff. People throw stuff
at me sometimes...

252
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,200
- if they don't like me, or something.
- They don't know you.

253
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,900
- If they don't like me, or something.
- They don't know you.

254
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,100
From TV.

255
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,500
But you just read the weather.

256
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,700
Well, I predict it.

257
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,900
You don't have a degree in meteorology.

258
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,200
I make suppositions, or I...

259
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,500
What are you doing?

260
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,400
- I walked over.
- You walked? It's freezing.

261
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,100
I have lymphoma, David.

262
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
What?

263
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,400
I have lymphoma.

264
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,500
- Doctor Pritch called.
- What?

265
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,000
I was having tremors.
That's the reason that I went in.

266
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,900
Pritch read my scans.

267
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,600
- What's the prognosis?
- Well, it's not good.

268
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,900
We'll talk about it this week.
I wanted to tell you.

269
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,800
Yeah.

270
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,200
I'll call you
after I've talked to Pritch again.

271
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,300
I'll drive you home.

272
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,100
I like the fresh air.

273
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,700
- Well, I'll walk back with you.
- No, that's okay.

274
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Okay.

275
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,300
Every couple months,
someone throws something at me...

276
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,000
a shake, a burrito once.

277
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,000
Why? My name, partly, I guess.

278
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,300
I changed it for professional reasons.

279
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,100
My first station manager suggested it.

280
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,800
He said it sounded refreshing
and that they wanted that quality.

281
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,200
That may be true, but it's also annoying.
I know that.

282
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,900
What kind of name is Spritz?

283
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,000
It's a bullshit name. It's a TV name.

284
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,500
He's bullshit.

285
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,600
Well, I like him. He's handsome.

286
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,600
He's an asshole.

287
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,500
I don't like his face.

288
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,200
His asshole face.

289
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,800
The other thing, my job is very easy.

290
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,000
Two hours a day,
basically reading prompts.

291
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,900
I make $240,000 a year...

292
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,300
plus appearances...

293
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,300
which are, you know,
not comfortable for me...

294
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,500
but lucrative.

295
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,600
"Four score and seven years ago...

296
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,300
"our fathers brought forth,
on this continent..."

297
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,000
Also, it makes other things easy,
being on TV.

298
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,100
Everything's easy.

299
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Yeah!

300
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,200
I receive a large reward for pretty much
zero effort and contribution.

301
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,600
The shakes and stuff
are a reaction to that, I think.

302
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,100
What must you think of me?

303
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,100
Your family-leaver.

304
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,500
Your non-meteorologist,
yet weatherman...

305
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,800
frosty-taking, fuck-happy son.

306
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,600
Don't die yet, Robert.
Give me time to get it together.

307
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,300
Give me a little while.

308
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,600
Let me get the Hello America job.
I can get it together.

309
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,200
Two for High Water.

310
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,400
- I got mine, Don.
- No, it's cool. I got it.

311
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Thanks.

312
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,400
Tricia's a bitch.

313
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,700
She's a little cunt.

314
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,100
I hate that little cunt.

315
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,400
I'd like to burn her.

316
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,700
Hi.

317
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,500
Today's the company party.
I thought I'd take the kids.

318
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,400
Oh.

319
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,400
Well, Mike is out.

320
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,900
- Shelly's home?
- She's walking Jackson.

321
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,900
- Where do you want to take them?
- The rink. WCH.

322
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,700
Hey.

323
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Hey.

324
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
What?

325
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
Dave.

326
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,400
Hey, Tim.

327
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,800
- I didn't know you were coming.
- I always come to these...

328
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,000
when I can.

329
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,500
I have some time this week if you want
to go back up to Bolingbrook.

330
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,100
- What's in Bolingbrook?
- Sportsman's. The archery range.

331
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,000
- Okay.
- Okay? You wanna go?

332
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,100
Okay, I remember it.

333
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,700
Well, do you wanna go back up?

334
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,700
Sometimes.

335
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,300
What's gonna happen?

336
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,600
What?

337
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,500
What are we gonna do here?

338
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,300
Great stuff.

339
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,100
Ladies and gentlemen, on your marks!

340
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,300
Let's go team Spritz!

341
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,900
Get set!

342
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Go!

343
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,900
Go! Go! Go!

344
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,500
- Just keep up, Shell. Come on.
- I'm trying to.

345
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,900
We should finish.

346
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,000
We're last. We're way last.

347
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,400
There's a lesson here. Let's finish.

348
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
I'm hurt.

349
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,200
Hon, you can do it.
You can finish. Okay?

350
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,100
I don't want you to quit.
It's gonna mean a lot to Dad. Okay?

351
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,100
All right.

352
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
Let's go.

353
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,500
That's my girl. That's it.

354
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,100
Good. I'm proud of you.

355
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,600
Okay?

356
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,100
Yay! That was great!

357
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,000
Hon. Hon, you okay?

358
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,100
You shouldn't have made me finish!

359
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,500
That was like 100 yards
you made me go.

360
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,100
I'm not a football-jocker.

361
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,700
What happened?

362
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,900
Just... We got tangled up in a sack.

363
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,000
- What happened?
- She tore her ACL.

364
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,100
These fucking crutches are too long!

365
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,800
- What did you say?
- Shelly!

366
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,500
- Well, what were you doing?
- It was a picnic.

367
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,400
- And she tore something?
- ACL. MCL.

368
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,500
Which?

369
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,900
Both.

370
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,100
- Dave!
- Well, we didn't go bungee jumping!

371
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,900
It was a fucking potato-sack race!

372
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,100
- That's where she got it.
- What?

373
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
"Fucking" this. "Fucking" that.

374
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,700
No, I never said that around her.

375
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,400
You don't know you have, Dave,
because you don't pay attention!

376
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,300
Fuck that.

377
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,300
What?

378
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,900
- Just fuck that, Noreen. You know...
- Dave.

379
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
- What?
- Step back.

380
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,800
- Step back?
- Step back.

381
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,400
What are you talking about, Russ?

382
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,600
- Russ...
- Step back right now.

383
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,800
- Fuck you, right now.
- Fuck you, Spritz.

384
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,600
Fuck you, fat asshole!

385
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,300
Dildo!

386
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,000
David, what are you doing?

387
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,200
I'm talking to my wife!
I'm talking to Noreen...

388
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,900
and this clown,
whose business this isn't.

389
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,500
You call me a dildo,
it is my business, Spritz.

390
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,300
You are a dildo, pork-fuck. You porker!

391
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,600
Stop, Son.

392
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,700
Would you?

393
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,100
Why don't you go?

394
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,400
Why are you here? Are you okay?

395
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,300
I came to talk to Noreen.

396
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,700
Dave, come on. I will talk to you later.

397
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,200
- Dave, what's going on, Son?
- It's nothing. Just...

398
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,200
Why are you here, anyway?

399
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,900
I came to talk to Noreen
about an issue concerning Shelly.

400
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,900
Well, you can talk to me.
I'm her parent, too. So? What?

401
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,000
Shelly dresses in clothing
not appropriate for her...

402
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,700
clinging stuff.

403
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,500
All kids wear...
Dad, it's a different generation.

404
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,300
They call her camel toe.

405
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,300
- What?
- Are you aware of that?

406
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
What?

407
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,500
That her colleagues call her camel toe.

408
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,800
What are you talking about?

409
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,700
It means the crease in her vagina...

410
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,000
that they can discern
through her clothing.

411
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,600
- What?
- Camel toe.

412
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,300
Yeah, I heard you.
I mean, how do you know they do that?

413
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,400
I heard it.

414
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,400
I picked Shelly up on Wednesday,
heard taunting, the older boys calling it.

415
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,700
- You might have heard wrong.
- No, I heard camel...

416
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,100
Okay, okay, look. I'll deal.

417
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,700
I want to get her through this ACL thing.

418
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,900
I'm gonna take her shooting.

419
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,900
I'm gonna reapply her there.

420
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,300
I'm gonna get her talking to me.
I'm gonna get to her...

421
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,200
and I'm gonna work it out.

422
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,600
A camel toe is pretty much
what Robert said it was.

423
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,500
It's basically just when you
can make out more than you should.

424
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,800
But it's the kind of thing...

425
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,700
She's 12, you know?

426
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,400
If you're around and paying attention,
you catch it...

427
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,100
then name-calling doesn't start,
and maybe smoking doesn't start.

428
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,600
And maybe she can just stay
a happy kid for a couple more years.

429
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,500
She shouldn't be unhappy.

430
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,000
Fuck. What did she ever do
to anybody? Shelly.

431
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,700
- Hello.
- Hey.

432
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,000
Hey.

433
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,300
Listen.

434
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,500
Noreen, I was thinking...

435
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,000
this pushing and pulling...

436
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,000
the tug-of-war we do sometimes...

437
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,900
it's not good for the kids.

438
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
It's not.

439
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,600
Noreen, let's see somebody.
Work it out. Let's...

440
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,100
- Fuck!
- Asshole!

441
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,700
Are you okay?

442
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,100
- I got hit with a pop!
- What?

443
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,500
A fucking...

444
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,600
A Big Gulp.

445
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,000
- Man.
- Are you okay? Are you okay?

446
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. So...

447
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,900
what I was saying...

448
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,500
See somebody?

449
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,500
We're going to begin
with some trust-building exercises.

450
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,300
The Buddy Drop. Up on your feet.
Let's go.

451
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,200
Dave, Noreen. Center circle.

452
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,100
Okay.

453
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,500
Now, Noreen,
you're just gonna let yourself go...

454
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,100
and Dave is gonna catch you.

455
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,000
- Just go back?
- Yeah. Cross your arms up front.

456
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,000
- Now?
- Whenever you're ready.

457
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Okay.

458
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,900
Good. Very good.

459
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,500
All right, Teresa, Mark. You're up.

460
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Okay.

461
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,700
Now I want you to name something...

462
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,200
that you did that affected your partner...

463
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,100
and that you're not proud of.

464
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,700
I had this thing with porno
on the computer, sort of.

465
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,100
I got a little preoccupied...

466
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,700
Actually, I want you to write it down,
not say it.

467
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,700
Okay.

468
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,400
I want you to put it on the paper
that you got for a reason.

469
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,300
Okay.

470
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,700
Now make sure it's something
the other person doesn't know about...

471
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,300
that they don't know.

472
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,700
All right.

473
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,900
Then you are going to give it
to the other person...

474
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,500
and the other person
is never going to look at it.

475
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Ever.

476
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,100
That's trust.

477
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
What's up?

478
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,900
I thought Dave's science-fiction novel,
or whatever it was...

479
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,400
was stupid and sucked...

480
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
and was a waste of time.

481
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,200
It was embarrassing. Four years?

482
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,500
Well, I thought that went pretty well.

483
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Yeah.

484
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,900
It wasn't science fiction,
just so you know.

485
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,600
- What?
- It wasn't science fiction.

486
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,900
- What are you talking about?
- Did you even read it?

487
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,300
No. One of the side characters
was a scientist...

488
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,800
- but that's not even important...
- God damn it, Dave. God damn it!

489
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,600
What? I'm just asking,
did you ever even read it?

490
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,700
It was hard to read.
It was poorly written.

491
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,600
You're an asshole. God.

492
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
You are a champion asshole.

493
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,000
You're a real blue-ribbon fuck!

494
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,400
I just wanna make it work, Noreen.

495
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,900
I just want to know everything,
so I can make it work. That's why I...

496
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,900
- I want to try again.
- I'm not going back. You fucked it up.

497
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,800
I mean, our marriage.

498
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
What?

499
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,200
I want to try again.

500
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,500
Fuck you.

501
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,300
You know, Dave, you can't even...

502
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,100
You looked at it. That's dishonest.
It's crappy.

503
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,900
- Noreen.
- Hey, should I look at yours?

504
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,200
That's all right.

505
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,700
No. No, no, Noreen...

506
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,300
"Throughout marriage
BJs lacked enthusiasm.

507
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,000
"Had difference of opinion
over how important that was.

508
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,300
"I thought very."

509
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,400
You know what, Dave?

510
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,400
You want to know
why my BJs lacked enthusiasm?

511
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,700
I hated you.

512
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,400
I hated your hair.

513
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,500
I hated your ugly legs, your forearms.

514
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,200
I hated kissing your lips, Dave. Okay?

515
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,000
And that's why I lacked enthusiasm
when your cock was in my mouth.

516
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,500
Hey, hon.

517
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,100
Shelly, it's cold.

518
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,400
Your father said it was going to be
65 degrees today, but...

519
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,400
Go ahead. I'll see you later.

520
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,700
How did it go?

521
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Good.

522
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,100
I'll call you tomorrow. Go ahead in.

523
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,300
Did you start my novel yet?

524
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,600
What's that?

525
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,100
Breaking Point. Did you start that?

526
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,600
No, I haven't yet, Son.
I've been preoccupied.

527
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,600
Well, that's good, actually.

528
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,700
I want to make some changes, so...

529
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,400
I'll give you the new one.

530
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,500
What did he say?

531
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,900
It's further bad news.

532
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,700
The metastatic plane
was too wide for radiation.

533
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,300
He suggested I see a Dr. Frost
in New York for clinical trials.

534
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,900
I got a feeler from Hello America.

535
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,100
National.

536
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,200
They're looking at 20 guys, but
they'll be cutting down to three soon.

537
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,900
It's a possibility.

538
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,500
The salary's great. It's real strong.

539
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,800
It would mean moving...

540
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,100
but I'd like to move everybody,
you know?

541
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,400
Renew things with Noreen.

542
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,300
We've been seeing somebody.

543
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,600
Let the kids start over in New York.

544
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,000
Keep them away from some
of the bad influences here that...

545
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,700
Just get a fresh start.

546
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,400
I think that would be great.

547
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,700
- That would be terrific.
- Yeah.

548
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,300
You could rededicate yourselves,
knuckle down.

549
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,000
What's this?

550
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,800
It's a Big Gulp.

551
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,600
You should say,
"We might see some snow...

552
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,700
"but it might shift south, miss us."

553
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,100
I can say it,
but I sort of wanna understand it.

554
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,100
Why is it?

555
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,800
Well, it's Canadian trade winds.

556
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,900
Behind all of it?

557
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,700
Yeah, this will get pushed by wind
out of Canada.

558
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,900
- So what's it gonna do?
- I don't know.

559
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,900
It's a guess.

560
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,700
It's wind, man. Blows all over the place.

561
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,600
For some reason...

562
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,400
I don't know.

563
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,200
I went back to Bolingbrook.

564
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
I bought a three-month lesson plan.

565
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,800
Hang on.
Before you do that, you know...

566
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,300
let's go out here
and do a little stretching exercises.

567
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,400
You got to rotate your...

568
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,900
We warm up...

569
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,500
then do basic focus drills,
stuff you never think about.

570
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,300
Like closing an eye
without moving your face...

571
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,700
because your face
is the anchor point for your hand...

572
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,500
that allows you to focus.

573
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,300
You have to keep your triangle
against a lot of force.

574
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,300
We do draws for a half hour,
then releases.

575
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,900
That's called "loosing,"
when you release.

576
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,000
Great shot! All right!

577
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,900
It's hard...

578
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,700
but that one good shot
leaves you thinking...

579
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,600
you might be catching on.

580
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,300
Do you lift weights?

581
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,200
- What's that?
- Do you lift weights?

582
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
Yeah.

583
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,700
- Cardio?
- Yeah, you have to do both.

584
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Yeah.

585
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,700
Are you on any kind of a program?

586
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,200
Yeah, our gym coach
gave us a program.

587
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,400
- That should be good.
- Yeah.

588
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,300
Yeah.

589
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,300
Fuck.

590
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,300
Hey.

591
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,700
- You know what would be interesting?
- What?

592
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,900
We should take some pictures.
Some shots, like...

593
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,000
some now,
some in a month or whatever...

594
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,100
see if you're making gains.

595
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,100
Yeah.

596
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,700
I've got my mom's Nikon.

597
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,500
- Whip your shirt off.
- Whip my shirt off?

598
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,800
Yeah.

599
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,800
You're shredded.

600
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,300
This is great, man.

601
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,300
We can compare this shit.

602
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,600
That's a Nikon FM?

603
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,800
Well, yeah.
You know something about cameras?

604
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,900
Yeah. I took a class at Parker.

605
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,700
A couple more.

606
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,500
My dad's gonna get the F3 for me...

607
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,100
if I can finish the program
and maintain a B average.

608
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,800
It's like a $600 camera.
I'm psyched about it.

609
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,500
I could loan that to you.

610
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,200
Yeah?

611
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,500
I could loan that shit to you if...

612
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,800
you wanted it earlier.

613
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,100
Okay.

614
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,000
This is gonna go a lot better.

615
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,200
Why?

616
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,900
Because I got you some bobtail arrows.
They're easier.

617
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,000
Why?

618
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,700
Well, they're thicker at the ends.

619
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,500
See? They taper toward the nock.

620
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,500
- What's the nock?
- The arrow end.

621
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,200
- What was I using before?
- Chested arrows.

622
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,600
That guy didn't know
what he was doing.

623
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,900
Okay.

624
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,900
Fletch it.

625
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,200
- What?
- Fix your arrow in.

626
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,700
That's the term.

627
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,700
Arrow makers were called fletchers.
That's where the last name came from.

628
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,100
Here. There's a little bit of a...

629
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,400
It takes a little while.
Right there, right below the nock.

630
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
There!

631
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,700
Awesome!

632
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,800
Okay, let's loose a few.

633
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,700
Let's show our stuff.

634
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,100
Aim about a half-foot above.

635
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,200
- Okay.
- You wait till you're steady.

636
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,700
- Are you aligned?
- Yeah.

637
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,500
Okay. Let it go.

638
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,900
Fuck!

639
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
Come on, Shelly. Get your arrow.

640
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,900
We probably didn't home long enough.

641
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,700
That's the pause between drawing back
and firing.

642
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,500
Let's pause a little longer.

643
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,100
What?

644
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,900
Nothing.

645
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,400
- Are you just not interested?
- Yeah.

646
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,900
Yeah, you're not interested?
Or, yeah, you are interested?

647
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,400
Yeah, I'm not. Really.

648
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,400
What was it you liked?
Let's think of it that way.

649
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,100
What?

650
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,200
What interested you
when you thought about archery?

651
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,500
When you wanted to do it.

652
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,700
I don't know.
Going hunting or something.

653
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,900
Hunting?

654
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,400
Yeah.

655
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,100
- For animals?
- Yeah.

656
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,000
You wanna shoot animals with arrows?

657
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,200
- Yeah.
- You do?

658
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,900
Yeah, to kill them.

659
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,000
But that's not archery. That's hunting.

660
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,200
That's called bowhunting.
That's what you wanted to do?

661
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,800
- Bowhunting?
- Yeah, I saw it on TV.

662
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,400
Well, I don't really wanna kill animals
with arrows...

663
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,900
so that's not going to happen.
We can target shoot, Shelly.

664
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,000
- It's not fun.
- It's a lot of fun.

665
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,500
- You have to apply yourself.
- Targets don't move.

666
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,100
Well, you know, Shelly...

667
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,700
you haven't really hit one yet.

668
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,800
You should support me.

669
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,800
I do support you. I support.

670
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,700
All right, forget it. Take your bracer off.

671
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,900
- We're not shooting anymore.
- Okay.

672
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,900
There's a chance
I might be going to New York.

673
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,100
A small chance.

674
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,500
You think you'd like to come,
maybe, if I go?

675
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,600
Yeah.

676
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,700
We could maybe go with Poppop.

677
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,000
- He's got some tests.
- Yeah.

678
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,100
Hey.

679
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,500
Hey, Mike.

680
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,300
You don't look real good, Dad.

681
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,100
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

682
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,100
- What are you doing out here?
- Just sitting here.

683
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,000
Sometimes I just sit here
and look at the house.

684
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,600
- You park here sometimes?
- Yeah. Sometimes.

685
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,300
I just like to see you guys.
I see you playing guitar up there.

686
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,500
Okay.

687
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,300
- Sounds good.
- Thanks.

688
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,700
- You know, Poppop...
- Yeah.

689
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,700
...he's sick.
- Mom said.

690
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
I was thinking about that, too.

691
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,700
Why do you have a bow and arrow
in there?

692
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,800
I was just out with Shelly.
I'm not playing favorites.

693
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,300
I just think we need to be together
for a while.

694
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,800
Yeah, that's okay.

695
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,900
- How's your program going?
- Great.

696
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,600
You're gonna get that camera
if you keep it up!

697
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,000
Look at this house.

698
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,700
Someone should be happy here.

699
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,200
How did I fuck this up?

700
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,100
Seriously.

701
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,800
What if I remembered the tartar sauce?
Would things be different?

702
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:18,900
Would Robert die
not thinking I'm a jerk-off...

703
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,500
jerk-fuck?

704
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Don't forget the tartar sauce.

705
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,600
Just call the order in, Noreen...

706
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,100
and quit busting
my you-know-what, okay?

707
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,500
You always half-listen
to what I'm saying to you!

708
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,300
I heard you. Tartar sauce.

709
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,900
Tartar sauce. Tartar sauce.
Tartar sauce.

710
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,900
Tartar sauce, tartar sauce,
tartar sauce, tartar sauce.

711
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,400
Man, how I'd like
to put my face in there.

712
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,000
Right in there. Tartar sauce.

713
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,300
My hips are cold. Tartar sauce.

714
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,900
That's when you know it's cold.

715
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,700
I like eating pussy. Tartar sauce.

716
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,200
A lot of guys don't.
Well, maybe they do.

717
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,700
Maybe that's just black guys.
Tartar sauce.

718
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,100
What happened to the guy
who was trying to go around the world...

719
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,400
in a balloon? Did he make it?

720
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,700
I should put some espionage...

721
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,600
or stolen plutonium in my novel.
Tartar sauce.

722
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,300
Spice it up. Neil Young. Fuck, it's cold!

723
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,500
Neil Young?
Why am I thinking about Neil Young?

724
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,700
Neil Diamond. Neil.
There's not a lot of famous Neils.

725
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,400
Is this Wednesday?
I wish I had two dicks.

726
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,300
I thought the whole family was going
to learn Spanish together this year.

727
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,000
That never really happened.

728
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I haven't had a Spanish omelet
in a long time.

729
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,400
Here we go.

730
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,000
Anything else?

731
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,900
No.

732
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,700
Where is the tartar sauce?

733
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,200
They were out. They apologized.

734
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,500
- They were cool about it.
- They were out?

735
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,600
- They were out.
- They were out of tartar sauce?

736
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,200
I'm calling them.

737
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,900
Fuck, Noreen.

738
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,400
It's not about the tartar sauce.
It's about you. You don't care!

739
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,200
I don't care about tartar sauce!

740
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,800
I'm trying to make a living for this family.

741
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,000
I've got work things to think about
and pressure.

742
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,200
Tartar sauce?
Fuck, Noreen, are you serious?

743
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,600
You are so selfish!

744
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,300
I would do anything for you...

745
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,600
- Everything you say is right.
...as if we're not happy.

746
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,900
- I'm trying to take care of the family.
- You come in here, looked in my face...

747
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,200
and you lied to me, Dave.

748
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,800
Do you think I'm a moron? "They're out."

749
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,900
We both just think it's better
for the kids.

750
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,800
David, sacrifice is...

751
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,200
To get anything of value,
you have to sacrifice.

752
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,000
I know that, Dad. But I think
if we continue down this road...

753
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,700
it's going to be too detrimental
for the kids.

754
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,400
It's just too hard.

755
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,100
Do you know that the harder thing to do
and the right thing to do...

756
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,700
are usually the same thing?

757
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,100
Nothing that has meaning is easy.

758
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,600
Easy doesn't enter into grown-up life.

759
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,600
I'm not comfortable
with an 18-degree variance.

760
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,900
- Why even forecast?
- It's a technical art...

761
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,900
not a science. People get that.

762
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,500
- Let's narrow it down, Tim.
- Dave, it's random.

763
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,200
We do our best.

764
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,300
A day can have that variance.

765
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,000
- Dave, phone call.
- Tell him to take a message.

766
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,400
It's Hello America.

767
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,700
Can we shop here?

768
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,600
Sure. Where is that?

769
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,200
- Bendel.
- All right.

770
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,500
Dad?

771
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,600
You know what? Let's go for a walk.
Take a break.

772
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,800
You don't like it?

773
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,800
No, maybe we'll come back later.
We'll just take a break.

774
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,600
- So how's everything going?
- Good.

775
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,000
- How's school?
- Good.

776
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,800
- Dance school?
- Good.

777
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,200
You know, when I was in school...

778
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,100
I guess the hardest thing
was how other kids can be a little mean.

779
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,500
Names and stuff.

780
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,000
Do you ever get called names?

781
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,700
Like what?

782
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,400
I don't know, like "dummy"
if you miss a question...

783
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,100
or "camel toe."

784
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,400
Yeah. Camel toe.

785
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,700
Do you know why?

786
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,900
Why what?

787
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,700
Why you get called camel toe?

788
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,800
Yeah.

789
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,700
Why, hon?

790
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,900
Because camel toes are tough.

791
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,300
They can walk all over the desert
and all the hot rocks.

792
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,600
I'm tough.

793
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,500
That's right. It's because they're tough.

794
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,600
You ready to shop again?

795
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,800
I think they make car tires
out of camel toes.

796
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,900
Yeah, I think I heard that.

797
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,900
I just think you're more grown-up
than that other stuff.

798
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,400
I don't think I like it.

799
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,500
But that was sort of kid stuff.

800
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,100
I like this dress. It's New York style.

801
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,300
Let me see.

802
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,300
Hey.

803
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,200
- You like it?
- I like it. Yeah.

804
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,900
Do you like it?

805
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,800
Yeah, I think I do.

806
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,700
Do you feel comfortable in it?
Because, you know, that's the thing.

807
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,100
Yeah, it's comfy.

808
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,500
You look great.

809
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,700
You look all grown-up.

810
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,600
Okay, change. Let's get some more.

811
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,700
Really?

812
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,600
Sure, and then we'll go show Poppop
some of this stuff.

813
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,300
Poppop! Poppop!

814
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,700
- Check this out.
- That's nice, hon.

815
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,900
I know. I got a lot more, too!

816
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,400
Dave.

817
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,100
- How are you feeling?
- I'm all right.

818
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,100
Mike got arrested.

819
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,900
What?

820
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,900
He fucked his drug counselor's car up.
They were on their way to a movie.

821
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,000
A movie?

822
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,000
Mike said he was trying to suck him off.

823
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,400
Then Mike chucked a rock
through his car's passenger window.

824
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,300
What is this sucking
and chucking rocks?

825
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,000
I mean, what is this?

826
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,000
What did the guy say?

827
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,300
He said Mike tried to jack his wallet.

828
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,400
What is this sucking and chucking
and jacking and fucking-up, Son?

829
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,500
He's 15 years old!

830
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,800
What is this shit?

831
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,300
- Where is he?
- He's at home.

832
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,500
What is this?

833
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,600
Fuck.

834
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,900
Are you ready for the doctors?

835
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,600
Yeah.

836
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,000
Got you! You're dead.

837
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I think just what he said happened,
happened.

838
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I think the guy was trying
to make a move on him...

839
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,900
and Mike got surprised and scared.

840
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,500
Hon, will you get me a pop
from the pop machine?

841
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,400
Can you get your pop later?

842
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,700
I'm trying to send Shelly away
so she doesn't have to hear this.

843
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,400
This guy says that Mike
tried to steal his wallet...

844
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,700
and that's why they were fighting
when the police came.

845
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,600
- How is he?
- He's scared. I don't know.

846
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,300
I can come home.

847
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,000
No, stay there
and do your Hello America thing.

848
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,800
- You act like...
- What?

849
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,900
Like Mike's in trouble...

850
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,500
'cause I'm interviewing
at Hello America. Give me a break!

851
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,000
I don't have any money.

852
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,100
Russ is helping anyway.

853
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,600
- That dildo's what?
- He's been a big help, okay?

854
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,200
You can stay there.

855
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,800
Fine. I'll stay here with camel toe.

856
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,900
You just take care of stuff there!
You take care of it!

857
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,700
Camel toe? What are you talking about?

858
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,900
I had to find out how kids
taunt Shelly about that...

859
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,200
and you're letting her get taunted.

860
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,300
You're not paying attention
to the way she goes to school!

861
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,800
I take care of everything around here.

862
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,900
Well, I bought her new stuff.

863
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,400
I bought her a bunch
of brand new stuff...

864
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,900
- and she told me all kinds of stuff, so...
- Don't be such a dick.

865
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,500
You have her for one weekend.

866
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,700
You know what, Noreen? Just...

867
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:56,000
Fuck! Whatever. Let me talk to Mike.

868
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,400
He's sleeping,
and don't talk to me like that.

869
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,600
More dildo, more fucking...

870
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,900
Listen, I have to go, Noreen.
I'll talk to you soon.

871
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,100
Whatever.

872
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,700
I thought you were trying
to improve matters with Noreen...

873
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,100
if not reconcile.

874
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,500
I am. What did Frost say?

875
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,200
He wants to speak to me
in about 10 minutes.

876
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,300
It was cold in there.

877
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,300
Would you get me a coffee, Dave?
So I can warm up.

878
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,200
Yeah, Dad.

879
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,300
Dildo. Jacking...

880
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,600
Hi.

881
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,800
Hi. $0.65.

882
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,300
Fuck.

883
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,500
- Hey.
- Hi.

884
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,100
Poppop went in?

885
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,100
- Yeah.
- Great. Yeah. He wanted a coffee.

886
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,600
Do you have my wallet?

887
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,100
You only had $1.

888
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,800
You should carry more money than that.

889
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,900
I know.

890
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,600
Well, did he say
whether any more therapy could...

891
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,800
No, he didn't have a different opinion
than Pritch.

892
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,300
There's too large a plane.

893
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,100
It's a no-go.

894
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,100
- Well, did he say...
- He said months.

895
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,700
- Did he say a lot of months?
- Well, what's a lot?

896
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,900
I don't know, like 12.

897
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,700
Well, if he meant 12,
he probably would've said a year, Son.

898
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,500
I think he meant three or four.

899
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,000
Well, you have a big day tomorrow.

900
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,700
The Hello America show.

901
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,900
Yeah.

902
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,000
... and here comes the grand marshal,
Dave Spritzel.

903
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,800
Didn't his name used to be Spritz?

904
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,100
Yeah, it sure did...

905
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,300
but he changed it back
to the original Spritzel.

906
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,500
Why the change, Ed?

907
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,600
Well, when you're national,
there's no more up.

908
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,800
So he changed it back...

909
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,400
like John "Cougar" Mellencamp.
He's realer now and more authentic.

910
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,500
- Who's that with him?
- Those are the wife and kids.

911
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,100
Didn't they used to have
a real fucked-up relationship?

912
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,600
Not anymore.
That's something else that changed.

913
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,700
It seems
Hello America with Byrant Gumbel...

914
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,200
gave them all a fresh start...

915
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,700
and an increase in salary to $980,000
outside promotional fees...

916
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,100
which puts Dave
well over $1 million a year.

917
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:58,500
- That got his wife's ear, I bet.
- You bet. That buys a lot of face time.

918
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,900
Now everything's great.

919
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,700
- Did he say that?
- Yeah, he told me that...

920
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,300
Hello, America.

921
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,300
What are your hobbies?

922
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,500
Writing. Archery.

923
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,700
And you don't have a degree
in meteorology?

924
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,900
General communications.

925
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,900
Well, listen. We've seen a lot
of your work in Chicago.

926
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:05,900
Okay.

927
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,900
We think you're great, refreshing.

928
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,600
We love the Spritz Nipper.

929
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,800
Great.

930
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,000
Why don't we run some blue screen,
and we'll do a walk-through on the set?

931
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Great.

932
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,600
Here's your station.
We'll run some screen.

933
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,500
Give me a second to set it up.

934
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

935
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,800
I'm waiting for Mark.
I'm running some screen.

936
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,300
- Dave.
- Bryant.

937
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,400
- Nervous?
- No.

938
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,300
- Sure?
- Yeah.

939
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,700
You look just a little bit nervous.

940
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,400
It's not nerves.

941
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,300
- Other shit.
- Yeah.

942
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,200
...mild in the Northwest.

943
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,900
As this high-pressure system
gives way...

944
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,500
we'll see warm temperatures
in New Mexico...

945
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,300
I know it's not neurosurgery...

946
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,400
but green screen is the one part
of my job that's not really easy.

947
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,100
...35 in New York with colder
temperatures west to Michigan...

948
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,400
You need a sense of where put-ons
will come from...

949
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,200
and a pretty strong sense of scale.

950
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,300
...there are travel advisories
in New Orleans and Atlanta.

951
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,400
It's pretty heavy weather...

952
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,300
I've gotten real good at it.

953
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,700
I thought everything went over
pretty well.

954
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,000
So we'll let you know
in a couple of days.

955
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,200
Okay.

956
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,500
This is my father, Robert Spritzel,
and my daughter.

957
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,900
We're a little late for our plane...

958
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,200
so we thought we'd leave from here.

959
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,400
- Yeah, I'm sorry. We kept you late.
- That's cool.

960
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,900
- So you've got the numbers?
- Yes.

961
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,300
There's a built-in with Purina
I forgot. $42,000.

962
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,300
Okay.

963
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,500
- What's a built-in?
- It's a compulsory endorsement...

964
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,700
if I'm offered the job.

965
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,700
- Dog food?
- Yeah. Pet products.

966
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,400
Dave doesn't own a pet.

967
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,500
Well, I have Jackson.

968
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,000
Jackson lives with your wife and kids.

969
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,500
We'll let you know.

970
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,400
- Russ is here.
- Okay.

971
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,500
- Where's Mike?
- Inside.

972
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,300
- Dave.
- Hi, Russ.

973
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,700
He's upstairs.
He's still pretty upset about it.

974
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,700
- Did he talk about it?
- Yeah.

975
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,900
- To you?
- He's told us what happened.

976
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,700
He was with his counselor, Don Boden.
I guess he...

977
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,800
I don't really know why
what happened next happened.

978
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,600
He was talking about my son,
and I was taking my gloves off.

979
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,100
Apparently, they were going to a movie...

980
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,700
- What the fuck?
- Why are you here?

981
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,300
- What are you doing?
- Why are you here?

982
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,100
- I'm helping Noreen!
- Why are you helping?

983
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,000
- Dave.
- Son. Jesus.

984
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,900
Here's something that...

985
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,700
if you want your father to think
you're not a silly fuck...

986
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,600
don't slap a guy across the face
with a glove.

987
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,000
Because if you do that,
that's what he will think...

988
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,700
unless you're a nobleman or something
in the 19th century...

989
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,100
which I'm not.

990
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,500
- You can get inside okay, Dad?
- Yeah.

991
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,700
"When my back's against the wall,
I order a chink call-girl...

992
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:24,900
"or I box some rounds with Richie...

993
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:27,800
"the Puerto Rican southpaw
at Clancey's gym.

994
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,100
"'But tonight,' Roy thought...

995
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,000
"'once I smuggle
this fucking plutonium out...

996
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,700
"'I'm just going to drink some Scotch
and hit the sack.'

997
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,500
"Roy had picked up Oliver
at his science lab...

998
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,500
"and there he snagged the vials.

999
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,900
"He stashed them
in his computer case..."

1000
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:59,200
My mom discovered an idea
known as a living funeral...

1001
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:02,700
in a book she read
to help her with Robert dying.

1002
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,000
It's where someone's family
and friends gather...

1003
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,600
like they might at the person's funeral...

1004
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,500
only when the person's alive,
so they can see everybody.

1005
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,900
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up?

1006
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,500
Hey, what's the Nipper?

1007
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,100
- What's that?
- What's the Nipper this week?

1008
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,500
I don't know.

1009
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,900
You don't know yet?

1010
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,300
Come on, man.

1011
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,400
What? I just asked you
about the Nipper.

1012
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,200
Monday, okay? That's the... Okay?

1013
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,500
- What's your problem?
- It's February, man. It's cold.

1014
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,000
Fuck!

1015
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,500
- Fuck you, then.
- Fuck you!

1016
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,100
Do you know what variance is?

1017
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,400
You think you could pick out a day...

1018
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,600
a week ahead and give a realistic...
You know?

1019
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,100
- Did you know that?
- Weatherman!

1020
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,300
God! Fuck!

1021
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,800
I have kids!

1022
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,100
I have to go see my kids!

1023
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:39,200
You put fucking pie shit on my coat!

1024
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,400
I have to see my kids
with pie on me, man?

1025
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,100
Go see your kids with shit on you!

1026
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,700
Hey, calm down, man!

1027
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,200
I have to see my family!

1028
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,100
I have to see...

1029
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,900
- Hello?
- Hello? Dave?

1030
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:08,100
- What?
- It's Mark Dersen from Hello America.

1031
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,300
Hi, Dave.

1032
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,200
- Take care.
- Okay.

1033
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,100
Noreen.

1034
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

1035
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,700
Shelly looks nice.

1036
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:35,400
We bought that in New York.

1037
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,600
Yeah, I know. That's why I said it.

1038
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,000
It's very nice.

1039
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:45,000
Noreen, I got offered the show.
Hello America with Bryant Gumbel.

1040
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,700
Well, that's great.

1041
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:53,700
- Are you gonna take it?
- I'm thinking about it.

1042
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:57,700
It's a pretty substantial salary,
and you know the venue. It's big.

1043
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,200
It's a pretty big salary jump, I guess.

1044
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,800
$1.2 million all in, Noreen.

1045
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,200
Can we think about that?

1046
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,900
What?

1047
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:16,700
What that kind of change
could be like for everybody.

1048
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,700
Mike, Shelly, you know?

1049
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,200
If we thought about trying again.

1050
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,600
Dave, I'm marrying Russ.

1051
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,700
Accuracy equals focusing on a point.

1052
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,600
Gravity pulls an inch a yard.

1053
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,000
You point up.

1054
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,100
But you have to factor in wind...

1055
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,300
which is the most difficult part.

1056
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,700
Noreen.

1057
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,800
I had to go in anyway.

1058
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,400
It was time for my speech.

1059
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,100
And that's what I know
about Robert Spritzel.

1060
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,700
Forbearance, charity, wisdom.

1061
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,700
There are too few like him.

1062
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,500
And now Robert's son, David.

1063
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,300
Good afternoon.

1064
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,600
Many of you came
from long distances...

1065
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:41,300
and I know I speak for my mom
and Noreen...

1066
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:44,900
and my family, Mike and Shelly,
when I say thank you.

1067
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:53,100
When I think of my dad,
I think of Bob Seger's Like a Rock.

1068
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,500
And then the power went out.

1069
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,800
Then, when the lights came back on
in 40 minutes...

1070
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,100
everyone had pretty much forgotten
that I was talking...

1071
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,500
and we never finished
that part of the thing.

1072
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,300
So my speech was,
"When I think of my dad...

1073
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,700
"I think of Bob Seger's Like a Rock."

1074
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,800
That's all I said
at my dad's living funeral...

1075
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,300
something about Bob Seger.

1076
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,100
You've reached 272-7638.
Please leave a message.

1077
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,900
Dave, it's Mark Dersen
from Hello America.

1078
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,900
Can you give me a call back?
I called a couple of times Friday...

1079
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,300
and I'm wondering
why you haven't called me back.

1080
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,600
If I need to move down on my list,
look, I need to know. Okay?

1081
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,100
It's not "Hello, you know,
whatever, Orlando."

1082
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,800
Look. I'm still jacked about you, Dave.

1083
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,200
I just need to hear from you.
Give me a call.

1084
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,700
Your phone's ringing.

1085
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,700
I know.

1086
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,200
Why aren't you getting it?

1087
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:45,000
It's the Bryant Gumbel thing.

1088
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,300
So why aren't you getting it?

1089
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,500
Did you bring that stuff?

1090
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,400
It's by the door.

1091
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,900
You should get it.

1092
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Fuck.

1093
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,500
It was a McDonald's hot apple pie.

1094
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,900
They're not kidding.

1095
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:22,800
It was hot.

1096
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,200
The other thing that gets to people...

1097
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,800
that leads to pies, I guess...

1098
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,100
are these catch phrases
we're required to use...

1099
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,200
to single the program out.

1100
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,900
It gets under people's skin.

1101
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,000
Spritz Nipper.

1102
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,300
But the whole thing about all of it...

1103
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,300
all the getting hit with stuff...

1104
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,700
the whole thing is, who gets hit
with a fucking pie, anyway?

1105
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,700
Did anyone ever throw a pie
at Thomas Jefferson?

1106
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,900
Or Buzz Aldrin? I doubt it.

1107
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,300
But this is like the ninth time I got...

1108
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,100
Clowns get hit with pies.

1109
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,600
- Fuck!
- I'm Mike's father! Here's your shit!

1110
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:50,000
I saw you buy this at the mall
on North Avenue!

1111
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,700
And I'm telling the cops, too!

1112
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:55,100
So you can cut your crap
about Mike jacking your wallet!

1113
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:03,000
He's just a kid. See!

1114
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,500
He looks grown, but he's just a kid!

1115
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,800
You fucking asshole.

1116
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:16,700
I mean,
I'll bet no one ever threw a pie at, like...

1117
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:20,400
Harriet Tubman, the founder of
the Underground Railroad.

1118
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,000
I'll bet you a million fucking dollars.

1119
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,700
The first time I was struck
with something...

1120
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,700
a chicken breast from Kenny Rogers...

1121
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,600
I was standing next to a garbage pail.

1122
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:05,200
I thought it might've been an accident,
that they were throwing it out.

1123
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,300
The second time,
it hit me square on the chin...

1124
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,000
a soft taco.

1125
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,500
Then, pop.

1126
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,900
A falafel.

1127
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,400
McNuggets.

1128
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,900
Always fast food.

1129
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,600
Fast food.

1130
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,900
Shit people would rather throw out
than finish.

1131
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,900
It's easy. It tastes all right...

1132
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:32,000
but it doesn't really provide you
any nourishment.

1133
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,500
I'm fast food.

1134
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Hey.

1135
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,800
Hey.

1136
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,000
- Did you see him?
- Yeah.

1137
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:51,500
Am I gonna get in trouble?
I didn't do anything.

1138
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:56,300
You're not in trouble. I took care of it.

1139
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,400
I got on him.

1140
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,000
I let him know
we're not messing around.

1141
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,200
I whaled on him.

1142
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,000
What?

1143
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,200
I caught him one clean one for sure,
on the forehead...

1144
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,500
and then I fucking whaled on him.

1145
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,500
Seriously?

1146
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:18,100
He's not going to say you stole anything,
and you're not in trouble.

1147
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,800
- What are you eating?
- Corn dog.

1148
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,300
You're a kid, Mike. Fuck.

1149
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,100
- I'm not a kid.
- You are a kid.

1150
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:53,700
Don't put yourself in grown-up situations
again until you're a grown-up.

1151
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,100
- Okay.
- Okay?

1152
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,200
Yeah.

1153
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:01,100
- Do you want me to get you a corn dog?
- What? No.

1154
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,100
What do you want?

1155
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:06,800
Nothing.

1156
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,800
Weatherman!

1157
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,500
- Hey.
- Hi.

1158
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,700
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1159
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:42,300
I just wanted you to...

1160
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,300
What?

1161
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,700
I was eighteen

1162
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,300
Didn't have a care

1163
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,400
Working for peanuts

1164
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,700
Not a dime to spare

1165
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:00,500
But I was lean and solid everywhere

1166
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,700
Like a rock

1167
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,300
I don't really get it.

1168
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,800
Am I following it?

1169
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:16,600
It was just a lead up
to other things I wanted to say.

1170
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,800
Here's the part.

1171
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,500
And I held firm

1172
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,700
To what I felt was right

1173
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,500
Like a rock

1174
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,600
I wanted to talk about that part...

1175
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,100
about you.

1176
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,500
That's like you.

1177
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,000
I was strong as I could be

1178
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,700
Like a rock

1179
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,900
I got the job.

1180
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,500
New York?

1181
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,700
That's terrific.
That's a remarkable income.

1182
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,200
That's more money than I ever made,
that salary.

1183
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,400
Yeah.

1184
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,900
That's quite
an American accomplishment.

1185
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:57,700
Thanks.

1186
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:02,700
Are you okay?

1187
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,300
I can't knuckle down.

1188
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:13,900
Noreen's marrying Russ.

1189
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:16,200
There's nothing
to knuckle down on, so...

1190
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,600
I can't fucking knuckle down.

1191
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,300
Your hand.

1192
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,500
I just saw Mike's counselor.

1193
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:33,200
Mike mentioned that you
were gonna fix this business up.

1194
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:36,500
He's in no trouble?

1195
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,100
Good job.

1196
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,000
Your hand okay?

1197
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,600
It's okay.

1198
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,600
- You certain?
- Don't worry.

1199
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,700
You always worry about your kids...

1200
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,200
no matter how old.

1201
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,100
There's always looking after.

1202
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,300
I read your book.

1203
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,100
Fuck.

1204
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:23,300
I was going to do some more work on it,
then I chucked it.

1205
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,500
- You chucked it.
- Garbage.

1206
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:32,100
It's just what I do, David.

1207
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,800
I've practiced and I've gotten good.

1208
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,200
Like you and the weather business.

1209
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,900
But I don't predict it.

1210
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:45,500
Nobody does, 'cause it's just wind.
It's wind.

1211
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,100
It blows all over the place!

1212
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,500
What the fuck?

1213
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,800
I have to go to work.

1214
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,800
David.

1215
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,000
This shit life...

1216
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:13,300
we must chuck some things.

1217
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,100
We must chuck them...

1218
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,300
in this shit life.

1219
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,300
There's always looking after.

1220
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,800
You have time.

1221
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,500
Thanks.

1222
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:43,600
Pretty soon after Robert's living funeral,
we had his real one.

1223
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,500
I'm sorry for your loss.

1224
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,400
That's a lovely thing to say to me.

1225
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,500
Where'd you hear that?

1226
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,300
His friends.

1227
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,700
I'm glad one of you brought an umbrella.

1228
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:04,700
I had a feeling
it was going to rain today.

1229
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:06,600
You're not going to take my job,
are you?

1230
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:10,600
No. I'm going to be a cameraman
for Monday Night Football.

1231
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,500
Is that okay?

1232
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,000
Yeah. That's good.

1233
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:25,400
There are a great many
of Robert's friends here, even in winter.

1234
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:29,300
I think it's because Robert was unusual.

1235
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,200
I think that's what
brought so many of you out.

1236
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,500
A loving husband
and father for 40 years.

1237
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:39,700
And a good friend to some of you
for longer.

1238
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:44,500
I'm sure that's why
we appreciated and loved Robert.

1239
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,100
He was excellent.

1240
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,100
Selfless.

1241
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,300
Resolute.

1242
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,700
I remember once...

1243
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:58,600
imagining what my life would be like,
what I'd be like.

1244
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,700
I pictured having all these qualities.

1245
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:05,600
Strong, positive qualities...

1246
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,600
that people could pick up on
from across a room.

1247
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,100
But as time passed...

1248
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:16,000
few ever became
any qualities I actually had.

1249
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:22,700
And all the possibilities I faced,
and the sorts of people I could be...

1250
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:27,000
all of them got reduced every year
to fewer and fewer...

1251
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,100
until finally they got reduced to one...

1252
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:32,300
to who I am.

1253
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:40,300
And that's who I am...

1254
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,500
the weatherman.

1255
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,800
But first Dave Spritz has the check
of our national weather. Dave.

1256
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,900
Well, thanks, Bryant. Well, it feels like
spring if you're in the Northeast.

1257
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,100
Is it gonna last? Let's take a look.

1258
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,000
We've got a warm weather system
to thank for these high temperatures...

1259
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,100
Mike, you ready for school?

1260
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,200
Russ?

1261
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,300
Let's go, guys.

1262
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:52,900
Come on.

1263
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,100
You're gonna get it!

1264
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,900
- Bye, Shelly.
- Bye, Mom.

1265
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,600
That's your national weather.
I'll be back with your local focus...

1266
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,200
at the bottom of the hour.

1267
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,400
- Hey, are you Dave Spritz?
- Yeah.

1268
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:27,300
- Can I get your autograph?
- Sure.

1269
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,600
So is it going to rain today?

1270
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,500
Who knows?

1271
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,900
Hey, Hello America.

1272
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,400
I've been doing the show
for a few months.

1273
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,300
People don't throw things
at me anymore...

1274
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:51,800
maybe because I carry a bow around.

1275
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,100
I don't know.

1276
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,600
I go back to Chicago weekends...

1277
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,500
keep it steady with Mike and Shelly...

1278
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:06,200
come back, do the weather.
So... Forecast?

1279
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,400
Come on.

1280
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,500
Another man is with my family.

1281
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:14,200
Things didn't work out
the way I predicted.

1282
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,200
Accepting that's not easy...

1283
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:19,900
but easy doesn't enter
into grown-up life.

1284
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,800
I'll take this American accomplishment.

1285
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,500
That's where I live...

1286
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:30,600
behind Fire Brigade 47. Okay.

1287
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,100
But in front of SpongeBob.

1288
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,900
Hello, America.
