00:00:56,632 --> 00:00:59,072
Don't! Don't come!

3
00:00:59,073 --> 00:01:02,073
Death, that's what you want, isn't it?

4
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:04,622
No! I don't want to die!

5
00:01:10,482 --> 00:01:12,122
You're my assistant aren't you?

6
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:14,122
I'll die with you!

7
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:17,870
Let's go to heaven

8
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:20,103
where your mom and dad
are waiting for you

9
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:09,836
"Sakajo Ryotarou"

10
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:40,106
Amane Misa

11
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:43,980
Your life's been extended

12
00:02:50,243 --> 00:02:53,188
Are you an ... angel?

13
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:56,079
No, I'm the Reaper

14
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:58,016
The Reaper£¿

15
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:05,862
Cool!

16
00:03:07,297 --> 00:03:10,978
The human whose name is written in the note shall...

17
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:13,169
die.

18
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,090
Akino SHiori was shot and killed by a woman at the museum

19
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,090
Misora Naomi, the murderer, also killed herself there

20
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,090
Did they know each other?

21
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,090
I don't know

22
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,100
Yagami Light, the boy who saw it, was Shiori's boyfriend, wasn't he?

23
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:04,094
Were they involved in a love triangle?

24
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:07,084
That's enough! Where do you think you are!

25
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:10,026
Are you from their college? Can I ask you couple questions?

26
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,605
No, we're not!

27
00:05:11,606 --> 00:05:14,387
Ah, you're detectives! Then I want to ask some...

28
00:05:14,422 --> 00:05:15,219
Get out of here!

29
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,922
The Police...?

30
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,649
I feel sorry for both Shiori and Light

31
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,090
Who said that Misora was an excellent FBI agent?

32
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,090
She was too obsessed with catching the one who killed her fiance

33
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:33,100
I don't understand why she suspected Light

34
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:35,070
They're here

35
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,090
Yagami Light

36
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,090
the hero of this tragedy who lost his girlfriend

37
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,090
His father is the director of the detective team

38
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,100
And his sister... must still be in high school

39
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:02,100
I heard Kira has something to do with this case

40
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,070
Don't say such nonsense

41
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Kira didn't kill her

42
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:11,110
Light must be hurt by such a heartless rumor

43
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:13,080
You're right..

44
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,762
Everyone feels sorry for you, Light

45
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,678
Dad, I will avenge Shiori

46
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,049
Sorry, I didn't want you involved

47
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:55,118
I'll definitely make Kira pay

48
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:57,284
You ARE the Kira, aren't you?

49
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,110
5 seconds!

50
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,080
Opening!

51
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:22,908
Good evening

52
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:25,724
Welcome to Evening Spot, I'm Nishiyama Saeko

53
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,880
Nakayama Kiyohiko, who murdered a girl, just died of heart attack

54
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,663
Nakayama was wanted for murder

55
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:43,795
But today in Shibuya he suddenly fell

56
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,595
and died of heart attack

57
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,760
Today was the 10th birthday of Aoki Takuma, the victim's brother

58
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,080
My sister asked Kira-sama from heaven to do this

59
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,090
I think this was a gift from her

60
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Currently, L, the mysterious detective ICPO invited to investigate

61
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:15,590
has concluded that Kira lives in Kanto, Japan, but has not achieved any further result

62
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:42,767
This is Kira's handy work

63
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:48,724
The police has not admitted though

64
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,110
You must leave everything communication device, including mobile phone here

65
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,130
Ryuzaki, here is Mr. Yagami Light

66
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:02,100
Ryuzaki£¿

67
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,140
I see, a false name to protect you from Kira

68
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:08,140
You're so sharp. How did you see it?

69
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:11,140
You can see it easily if you think of the cases logically

70
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,120
I've heard about your extraordinary ability

71
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:21,080
Not sure if they were being sarcastic..

72
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,769
I suspect you to be Kira

73
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,657
Are you joking?

74
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:33,667
I don't like to joke

75
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:34,668
Then why did you invite such a dangerous person?

76
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,140
Because if I die, you'll be suspected the most

77
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:41,173
You mean, if you die, I'm Kira

78
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,150
How did you came up with that?

79
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,150
Our investigation status has leaked out to Kira

80
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:51,090
so I had the FBI team investigate our members and their family

81
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,552
including you, Light

82
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,866
I felt like someone's been following me

83
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:00,049
As a result, we've lost

84
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,090
Every member of the team was killed. This is a shame

85
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,958
But we succeeded in profiling the most suspicious person

86
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:12,258
out of the people we have investigated

87
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:13,641
You mean me?

88
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:17,956
Yes, and we set cameras and taps in your room

89
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,120
That's illegal...!

90
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,535
Did my father agree too?

91
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,130
It was a special case

92
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:30,130
If so, it must've proved that I'm innocent

93
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:33,442
I bet you can outwit them easily

94
00:11:33,636 --> 00:11:38,079
Besides, Misora Naomi reached you although we didn't give her any information

95
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,625
Hey, Wait!

96
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:45,807
You're too mean... Light just lost his grilfriend!

97
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:47,596
because Misora Naomi killed her!

98
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,567
Kira can control the dying situations

99
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,090
You think that I controlled Shiori and Misora and killed them...

100
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:56,837
What for£¿

101
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,130
To make people feel sorry for you and to join our team

102
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:02,382
to approach me and...

103
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:03,746
to kill me

104
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,140
You bastard!

105
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:09,434
You may have a superior intelligence, but you don't have a heart!

106
00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:14,370
Mr. Matsuda, I can prove my innocence on my own

107
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:19,693
So, how do you thik I killed those people?

108
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,160
That's the only think I want to know

109
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:28,090
It will give the answer to every mystery

110
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,130
If all the mysteries were solved and it told that I'm Kira...

111
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,497
Unfortunately, death penalty

112
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,110
Checkmate

113
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,150
bravo

114
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:53,160
We don't suspect you Light

115
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:58,239
Ryuzaki too. He examined you just to know the probability

116
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:00,324
You need to suspect, when you're investigating

117
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:05,176
But the more important thing is to stop Kira from killing people as soon as possible

118
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,388
I also hope...

119
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,740
that you're not Kira

120
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,512
If you get the Reaper's eye, you can see his real name

121
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,150
by giving me half of your lifetime

122
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:22,182
You can kill him when you want!

123
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,160
The Diet has stopped the regular council by the speech from the PM

124
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:31,543
that crime rate is decreasing because of Kira

125
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,422
but many of the citizens and the young members of the Diet

126
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:38,110
rather seem to support his opinion

127
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,150
Killing is bad, but

128
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:45,150
a nation often kills criminals under the law

129
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,620
The matter is whether it is a "right killing" or not

130
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:55,956
from this point of view, Kira's killing seems to be justified

131
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,022
Who? Who made this idiot in charge of the government?

132
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,170
We must not allow this situation to happen, sir

133
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:06,170
Yagami, what are you thinking?

134
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:09,171
Where and what is your team doing?

135
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,590
Everything we do is based on L's directions

136
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:17,952
What kind of person is L?

137
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,120
Is he American?

138
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,198
I can't tell you, sir

139
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:23,650
You!

140
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,024
L is risking his own life

141
00:14:26,304 --> 00:14:29,005
We believe his will and follow him

142
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,170
I understand

143
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,903
You can have request money or staff as much as you need, so...

144
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:36,957
catch Kira right away!

145
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,832
Nothing exciting at the Sakura TV festival

146
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,160
Isn't there any entertainment?

147
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,160
TV stars for example?

148
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:58,160
That'll cause a riot!

149
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:00,896
No, I don't think it's gonna happen

150
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,170
I beg you Mr. Demegawa! We might lose Saeko's life

151
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:09,482
You must leave it to me as I've been doing research on Kira

152
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,675
I understand him the most

153
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,150
You are kind of..

154
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,150
unattractive

155
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:19,150
Morning!

156
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:21,882
Not attractive?

157
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,160
-Saeko, this is our chance!
-I'm so excited

158
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:29,160
Are you sure it's ok to broadcast it without boss's permission?

159
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:32,170
Protect me even it gets you fired!

160
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:36,170
If we can get the ratings, they'll put hundreds of testimonials on the wall!

161
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:39,180
It's going to be the true Sakura TV festival

162
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:41,693
News isn't a comedy show!

163
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,180
Who do you think you are?

164
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:50,120
Your head and here should both be a little softer

165
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
Save the sexual harassment..

166
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:57,120
This is a case of kill or cure

167
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,170
What?

168
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:07,170
Director

169
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:09,180
We've got information that Sakurat TV

170
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,763
will broadcast a message from Kira

171
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,190
3 days ago

172
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:23,160
We received two videotapes from somone who called himself the Second Kira

173
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:25,160
The Second Kira?

174
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:27,160
In the first videotape

175
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:31,120
there was a notice that the murderer who was arrested recently would die

176
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,170
and yesterday, he did die of heart attack

177
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,180
Ms. Sagami, confirm it please

178
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:41,180
Yes

179
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,180
Also, the Second Kira

180
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:47,140
requested us to broadcast the other video from 2:59 pm today

181
00:16:49,197 --> 00:16:51,667
We have not watched this video

182
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,160
As I said in the beginning

183
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:58,595
the Second Kira demanded us to broadcast the video

184
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,347
or he would kill all of our staff from the top

185
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:09,167
Please understand that we are hostages of Kira

186
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:22,130
As journalists, we risk our lives to broadcast this

187
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,274
Everyone should stay calm

188
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:27,214
Is this.. really happening here?

189
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,987
I don't want to goto Sakura TV festival anymore

190
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,170
It's now 2:59. Please watch this video

191
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:37,140
Here it is

192
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,180
I am the Second Kira

193
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:44,180
Just like Kira, I also hate evil

194
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:48,140
and I want to create an ideal world where there's no crime

195
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,910
Anyone who opposes Kira is my enemy

196
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,190
Anyone who disturbes Kira is letting brutal criminals go free

197
00:17:57,974 --> 00:18:01,036
so they must die so the society can become peaceful

198
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:08,476
Hibima Kazuhiko, one of the opposers who's now appearing on Taiyo TV

199
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,568
Will die of heart attack

200
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:14,881
Kira's judgement is autocratic.

201
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,180
He is just a cruel murderer.

202
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:16,028
But..

203
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,140
What's wrong with Taiyo TV?

204
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,915
-Hurry!

205
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:32,431
He certainly is an autocrat
We might be slaves of Kira

206
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:41,987
Mr. Hibima?

207
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,150
Somebody.. Help

208
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,150
Someone please help

209
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,190
You alright¡­

210
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:53,190
Can you hear me

211
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:55,160
Still breathing?

212
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Mr. Hibima unfairly insisted that Kira was evil and criticized him

213
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:05,964
He deserves death

214
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:07,842
Stop it!

215
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,130
You must accept Kira so we can create a future together

216
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,180
What are you doing?

217
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:17,180
Make them stop showing it now!

218
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,190
The producer of the program doesn't answer the phone

219
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,190
They just want the audience rating

220
00:19:23,225 --> 00:19:25,160
Mr. Mogi arrived at the scene?

221
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,160
The furture is with Kira

222
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:35,522
If you agree with Kira's justice, gather in from of Sakura TV

223
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,710
Let's raise our voices for Kira

224
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,180
Only Kira can purify this unclean world

225
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,180
He's right!

226
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:48,150
Kira is doing the right thing!

227
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,190
Crime is decreasing thanks to Kira

228
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:54,190
That critic sure deserves it!

229
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:57,685
Today's the Kira festival!

230
00:19:58,685 --> 00:19:59,882
I'm scared! Let's go!

231
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,630
Come one, let's see what'll happen.
I'm actually a Kira supporter

232
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:03,827
What?

233
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,170
Kira¡­

234
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,180
I won't let anyone interfer with what Kira's doing

235
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,180
Anyone does will die

236
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,190
Police!

237
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:20,269
Mr. Mogi

238
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:21,449
Stop!

239
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,190
Don't support Kira's justice

240
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:28,200
Do you defend the cruel mass murderer?

241
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:30,873
Don't forgive him!
Get away from here now!

242
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
What are you talking about? The police is totally useless

243
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:35,170
ya¡­

244
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,447
Kira is now protecting the world

245
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,954
No, Kira is a cruel murderer!

246
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,220
Wake up and disperse!

247
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:46,220
Kira taught us...

248
00:20:46,255 --> 00:20:48,190
Disperse¡­

249
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:49,844
You are in danger too!

250
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,150
.... that the laws never help us

251
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Do you hear the cries of the people?

252
00:21:02,235 --> 00:21:07,556
People who lose their love can never be healed

253
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,621
Stop it

254
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:11,971
Mr. Mogi!

255
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,180
Mr. Mogi¡­

256
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,190
Mr. Mogi¡­

257
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,160
Mr. Mogi¡­

258
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,505
Do you hear the murderer's laugh?

259
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:28,727
Who took lives of innocent people, and live without being punished

260
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,200
You're in danger!
Get away from here!

261
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,210
Step aside!

262
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:38,180
Let me through

263
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,180
Disperse¡­

264
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,220
Get back

265
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:46,062
What are you doing?

266
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:48,076
You must stay away from here

267
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:07,176
Kira has begun to act

268
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,210
for a bright, ideal world

269
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:13,880
Camera no. 1, zoom in on the fallen policemen

270
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,180
Great! He's dead!

271
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,841
You'll be dead if you go there

272
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,230
We can't just sit here and watch TV!

273
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:28,733
This Kira might be able to kill just by seeing the faces

274
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,412
The the policemen near the scene to keep away

275
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,170
Yes

276
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,180
Ryuzaki...!

277
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,170
We must fight with Kira

278
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,220
But

279
00:22:48,255 --> 00:22:50,220
We must rescue Sayu!

280
00:22:50,255 --> 00:22:52,230
This Kira's targets

281
00:22:52,265 --> 00:22:54,230
are people who interrupt the broadcasting

282
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:57,230
Sayu should be safe

283
00:22:57,265 --> 00:22:59,230
And Kira, if you're watching TV,

284
00:22:59,265 --> 00:23:01,240
Come here now

285
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:04,886
I promise I will help you

286
00:23:06,097 --> 00:23:09,655
As you see, I have the eye

287
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,170
Let me see your Reaper, then I'll show you mine

288
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,190
Reaper£¿

289
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,641
Do you expect me to believe that such things really exist?

290
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,951
It must mean the ability of killing

291
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,991
And let's create a new world together!

292
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,210
What do you mean by the new world!

293
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:37,210
You murderer!

294
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:40,210
How can you kill people so easily?

295
00:23:40,842 --> 00:23:43,091
What did they do to you£¿

296
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,180
Murderer!

297
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,220
Murderer!

298
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:50,219
Sayu...! Don't upset him!

299
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,200
Murderer

300
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,200
Murderer¡­

301
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,200
Murderer

302
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,190
Murderer!

303
00:24:56,941 --> 00:24:58,567
What are you doing!

304
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,190
A car just crashed into the station

305
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,220
We don't know yet what exactly happened

306
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:23,190
Is that..

307
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,236
really?

308
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:29,695
Sayu!

309
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,386
Dad?

310
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,862
Cover your face with this

311
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,210
go inside

312
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,190
Mogi..

313
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,439
We'll inform you as soon as we find out what is happening at the entrance

314
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,250
Alright, cut to commercials

315
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:20,260
The ratings will be 30... no, 40 at least

316
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:22,190
L's message earned 35%

317
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,230
You can't go in

318
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:28,200
Step aside

319
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,240
Is that you?

320
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:33,240
You're the producer£¿

321
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:34,508
You can't enter without...

322
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,157
The police£¿Stop broadcasting now!

323
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,460
If we do that, we're gonna die

324
00:26:41,155 --> 00:26:42,578
You want to see innocent people...

325
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:44,244
forced to get involved and killed?

326
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,168
I got it!

327
00:26:46,851 --> 00:26:47,749
Calm down¡­

328
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,532
Got it..

329
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,264
Hello?

330
00:26:54,962 --> 00:26:55,632
Thank you

331
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:02,325
Ryuzaki, I told them to stop broadcasting

332
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,719
I go the videotapes too

333
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:05,888
This is as I thought

334
00:27:06,132 --> 00:27:06,948
It was Mr. yagami!

335
00:27:07,721 --> 00:27:09,816
I can't do this in such as way

336
00:27:10,037 --> 00:27:11,708
Dad, where is Sayu? Is she alright?

337
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,385
Light..

338
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:16,897
Yes, we're both fine

339
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,428
Mr. Yagami, are you still wearing a helmet?

340
00:27:21,256 --> 00:27:23,046
No, I took it off

341
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,672
I'll go pick them up

342
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,694
Please arrange for the permission to enter the studio

343
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:27,864
You'll be Kira's target!

344
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:30,071
Dad and Sayu will not be harmed inside the studio

345
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,125
The Second Kira surely has the Reaper's eye

346
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,043
You've got a nice buddy huh?

347
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:45,250
No

348
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:47,760
There's no proof that he's not my enemy

349
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,201
Then isn't it dangerous to go?

350
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,926
If he truely supports me, he'll be a strong weapon to wipe out L

351
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,171
I must find him before L does

352
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,240
Move out

353
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,200
Sakura TV has stopped broadcasting, following the order from the police

354
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,250
Taiyo TV

355
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:17,250
is protesting against Sakura TV

356
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:19,260
According to Taiyo TV

357
00:28:19,295 --> 00:28:23,220
Mr. Hibima died because of Sakura TV

358
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,854
Misa, the recording is cancelled

359
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,270
yeah, alright

360
00:28:32,305 --> 00:28:33,830
It can't be helped

361
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:35,992
I need to change clothes

362
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:48,548
The Kira didn't show up

363
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,210
-Sayu
-Light

364
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,898
I was worried about you

365
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:14,759
Mr. Mogi..

366
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:16,220
He was killed¡­

367
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,270
Yes, I will report it

368
00:29:27,305 --> 00:29:29,230
Excuse me

369
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,220
Kira...?

370
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,892
I found you

371
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,903
I knew he'd come to me

372
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,065
Yagami...

373
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,365
Tsuki?

374
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,280
The videotapes were dispatched

375
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:14,633
at a post office in Kita-ku Osaka

376
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,250
The fingerprints are so small

377
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:19,260
so 'he' might be 'she'

378
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:23,260
Are you sure that these are from the Second Kira?

379
00:30:23,295 --> 00:30:26,260
It may be a fake

380
00:30:26,295 --> 00:30:30,270
You mean, this might be a fake by Kira that there are more Kiras?

381
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:32,355
Light, what do you think?

382
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:34,962
That's impossible

383
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,624
And this Kira can kill only by seeing the faces

384
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
The video images were childish,

385
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:42,280
trying to use the media slyly

386
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:45,280
This Kira is way stupid and different from the first Kira

387
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,397
Besides, the first Kira doesn't kill innocent people

388
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,244
You're right

389
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,482
If I were Kira, I'd get angry

390
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,270
This Kira tried to make us believe that he was outside the studio

391
00:30:58,305 --> 00:31:00,270
Had the studio on surveillance

392
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:03,270
He could be hidden inside the studio

393
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:05,293
Check everyone in the studio

394
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,206
If the first Kira joins the second Kira

395
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:12,614
It will be a huge threat

396
00:31:13,884 --> 00:31:15,783
We must prevent it. Mr Yagami..

397
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:18,716
Is it possible to send Kira a message through TV?

398
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,684
What kind of message?

399
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:29,284
Nishiyama Saeko is the No. 1 anchorwoman in Japan

400
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,069
Thank you so much

401
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:34,716
That's clever... You're the man, Demegawa

402
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:38,471
How can they be so blind?

403
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:42,922
The Second Kira trusted and sent the tapes to us

404
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,756
because you've been reporting on the First Kira's activities

405
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,856
They should appreciate you

406
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,963
Irritating¡­

407
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,987
Why didn't you become an anchor?

408
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,408
See how Saeko behaves?

409
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:02,369
To be an anchor, you have to sell youself as a 'female'

410
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,170
I can't stand it

411
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,710
You're prettier than her

412
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,552
Give me a break

413
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,848
Demegawa!

414
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:13,955
Did you survive the torture by the police?

415
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:16,753
Yeah, and more than that

416
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,091
I got a sweet gift from them

417
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:19,950
What's that?

418
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:22,321
That's a message from the police to the Second Kira

419
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,065
We can expect high ratings

420
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,260
Great job!

421
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,725
This is a message for the Second Kira

422
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,270
Stop trying to approach the First Kira

423
00:32:32,305 --> 00:32:34,240
It's not too late if you haven't met him

424
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:39,280
You must never get involved in Kira just because you're curious

425
00:32:39,315 --> 00:32:41,280
You'll be used

426
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:43,280
and definitely killed by Kira

427
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:45,250
Yagami Light....

428
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:52,706
It's written "Moon"
but read "Light"

429
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,300
"...please provide us with any information regarding Kira"

430
00:32:56,335 --> 00:32:58,300
"... save those living under Kira's terrorist acts"

431
00:32:58,335 --> 00:33:00,332
"... and save the world"

432
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,246
Reating the message...

433
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Here is the data for every staff at Sakura TV

434
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:12,037
and the list of people who entered the studio that day

435
00:33:12,263 --> 00:33:13,581
What a huge amount

436
00:33:15,016 --> 00:33:16,152
That total...

437
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:18,754
8000 people. approximately.

438
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:19,940
Let's start

439
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,250
Oh, good evening!

440
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,217
Nice to meet you, I'm Amane Misa

441
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,705
You're a friend of Sayu?

442
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,357
Oh, no

443
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:52,236
I was watching TV and... I thought you must be worried.

444
00:33:53,055 --> 00:33:55,221
I couldn't help come to see you

445
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,280
to show you this notebook

446
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,764
Here, touch it

447
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,587
Light, you're back!

448
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,290
She's my friend.

449
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:22,343
She'll come to my room for a while

450
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,346
Hello

451
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,869
Light, did you invite a friend?

452
00:34:30,132 --> 00:34:31,456
Nice to meet you

453
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,472
Her face looks familiar...

454
00:34:43,507 --> 00:34:46,776
She's Misa-misa! of the Happy Sweets!

455
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,675
Yeah! Amane Misa!

456
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:04,052
How did you know it?

457
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:06,177
Ah, that's what I thought!

458
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:08,622
You haven't done 'the deal'

459
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:12,401
You know, you can see people's names and their lifespan

460
00:35:13,171 --> 00:35:15,999
but you can't see the lifespan of a person who has the notebook

461
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,952
I couldn't answer unless you ask me

462
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,443
Are you... working in the studio or something?

463
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,260
um... I... I think I'm kind of famous..

464
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:37,997
A singer?

465
00:35:38,032 --> 00:35:40,007
Oh, actually, this is my first CD.

466
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,320
I also appear on magazine and TV.

467
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:45,017
Oh, there's a new movie too

468
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,986
How did you find out where I live?

469
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,290
From the internet,

470
00:35:51,325 --> 00:35:53,290
You gave a speech at the entrance ceremony of college

471
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,300
I found a photo of you there

472
00:35:55,335 --> 00:35:58,300
If you were arrested,

473
00:35:58,335 --> 00:35:59,689
Kira's secrets would come out!

474
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,300
I'm sorry!

475
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,310
But I haven't been arrested

476
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:08,037
and I won't be if I follow your orders from now on

477
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,690
Right?

478
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,156
I can find out L's name

479
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,320
I'll be your eyes. So...

480
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,260
So what?

481
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,313
Let me be your girlfriend

482
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,494
I can't

483
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:32,942
Why not?

484
00:36:33,246 --> 00:36:35,514
There are your fingerprints on the tapes

485
00:36:35,983 --> 00:36:38,744
If the police take fingerprints directly from you,

486
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,736
they'll find out you're the Second Kira.

487
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,225
Those weren't mine!

488
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:46,046
I'm not that stupid

489
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,320
I have a friend in Osaka who's into the occult

490
00:36:49,355 --> 00:36:51,330
and I showed her fake pictures of ghosts

491
00:36:51,365 --> 00:36:54,330
and asked her to send videos to TV stations together...

492
00:36:54,365 --> 00:36:56,947
And what is she doing now?

493
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,246
If you want, I'll kill her right now

494
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,146
No, The police'll easily link her to you

495
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,837
If you don't believe me...

496
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,808
You can keep my Death Note

497
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,320
I'm still the owner of the notebook even if you keep it.

498
00:37:17,355 --> 00:37:20,320
So I can still work my eyes for you.

499
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:22,204
Right Remu?

500
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:24,326
Yes, you're right

501
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,812
Now, I can't kill you

502
00:37:31,178 --> 00:37:33,598
and you can kill me if you don't need me

503
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,299
I'm happy...

504
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,902
...even if you're just going to use me

505
00:37:48,144 --> 00:37:49,560
Trust me

506
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,075
Why are you doing this?

507
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,367
Misa lost all of her family members 3 years ago

508
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:03,450
They were killed by a burglar

509
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,720
Since Misa had seen his face

510
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,625
The suspect was soon arrested

511
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,730
But Misa was the only witness so it wasn't enough to convict him

512
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,452
Tamura Yoichi, the suspect was soon released

513
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,670
She was caught in a deep empty darkness in her mind

514
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,758
Everyone gave up on Misa's future

515
00:38:45,308 --> 00:38:47,235
But one day,

516
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,429
Something happened

517
00:38:55,494 --> 00:38:57,676
"Tamura Yoichi Found Dead"

518
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,988
"Is This Kira?"

519
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,779
Kira punished him

520
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:11,363
Misa was grateful to the God named Kira

521
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,077
Please

522
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:27,384
Trust me

523
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,734
You are everything to me

524
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,537
But you killed innocent policemen

525
00:39:36,562 --> 00:39:40,075
Don't you think it's the same as the burglar who killed your family?

526
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,075
Don't say such things to me?

527
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,720
You also think that..

528
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:51,172
...sacrifices for the good of all can't be helped

529
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,690
It was the only thing I could do

530
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,339
I really wanted to see you

531
00:40:11,273 --> 00:40:12,615
I understand

532
00:40:15,324 --> 00:40:17,015
For me...

533
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,780
You shortened your own life...

534
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,178
Your eyes became my weapon

535
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,185
Thank you...

536
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,123
I'll do my best

537
00:40:34,175 --> 00:40:36,145
to be loved by you..

538
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:51,676
I'll arrange a chance for you to see L.

539
00:40:51,865 --> 00:40:54,865
And you'll see L's real name

540
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,778
Can you do it?

541
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:00,644
You don't have to ask me, just say "do it"

542
00:41:00,938 --> 00:41:04,360
I'll do anything you want me to

543
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:07,207
If one of us gets arrested

544
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:09,885
we'll never talk about the other one and the Death Note

545
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,092
Can you swear?

546
00:41:12,885 --> 00:41:14,624
Yes, I swear

547
00:41:14,885 --> 00:41:16,324
Good

548
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:22,041
Then... It's my turn

549
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:27,309
We're gonna date at least once a week

550
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,858
You don't understand what I said

551
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,875
But once L dies,

552
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,641
There won't be no difficulty between us, right?

553
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:37,285
You underestimate L

554
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:39,294
Besides L is already...

555
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:42,266
Suspecting that I am Kira

556
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:43,267
What?

557
00:41:44,948 --> 00:41:46,574
L is so smart

558
00:41:47,596 --> 00:41:51,440
Everybody says L hasn't figured out anything yet...

559
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,834
Now I've reached a position where I can contact him directly,

560
00:41:54,895 --> 00:41:57,475
L and Kira are getting closer...?

561
00:42:00,548 --> 00:42:02,161
I'm impressed by both!

562
00:42:02,162 --> 00:42:03,557
It's so exciting

563
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:06,033
And of course, I need you to kill L.

564
00:42:06,528 --> 00:42:08,503
So I wanted to contact you as quickly as possible

565
00:42:08,538 --> 00:42:11,271
If so, why just can't we date?

566
00:42:11,306 --> 00:42:12,885
If you want to date once a week

567
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,885
I'll have to date other girls

568
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,895
to avoid being suspected that we have a special relationship

569
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,855
You can't do that

570
00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:23,895
If I see you dating other girl..

571
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:26,394
I'll kill her!

572
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:29,328
I'm the only one who'll date you!

573
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:32,419
If you don't obey me, I have to kill you

574
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,875
I won't let you kill her, Yagami Light!

575
00:42:38,885 --> 00:42:40,885
If you harm this girl,

576
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,707
I won't forgive you

577
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:45,523
I see her lifespan

578
00:42:46,393 --> 00:42:49,820
If she dies, I'll think it's because you killed her. I'll have to kill you

579
00:42:49,895 --> 00:42:52,840
If I find you trying to kill her..

580
00:42:52,895 --> 00:42:55,920
I'll kill you before that happens

581
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:15,243
Ryuzaki...?

582
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:20,504
Since that, there's no new action by the Second Kira

583
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:25,741
I'm afriad the FIrst and the Second Kira have made contact already

584
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,069
Isn't it careless to expose your face?

585
00:43:29,104 --> 00:43:31,992
Yes, it's dangerous if you're Kira

586
00:43:32,535 --> 00:43:36,566
You're the only one outside who knows that I'm L, so

587
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:41,311
If you told the Second Kira about me, it's "the end." To avoid it,

588
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,855
I brought this

589
00:43:46,526 --> 00:43:47,692
That'll work

590
00:43:49,895 --> 00:43:51,375
Did you come to watch over me?

591
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,496
You think Kira is a college student. don't you?

592
00:43:54,895 --> 00:43:57,905
I have an important job here

593
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,197
About Kira?

594
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:03,322
Light

595
00:44:05,915 --> 00:44:08,138
I had a recording nearby so I came to see you

596
00:44:08,173 --> 00:44:08,985
Here I am

597
00:44:10,885 --> 00:44:11,784
You

598
00:44:18,068 --> 00:44:19,110
Oh?

599
00:44:19,895 --> 00:44:22,048
Are you Light's friend?

600
00:44:22,752 --> 00:44:23,437
Yeah

601
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:27,849
His name is Ryuzaki

602
00:44:29,905 --> 00:44:32,650
Why're you wearing such as stupid mask?

603
00:44:32,905 --> 00:44:35,298
Why don't you take it off?

604
00:44:37,915 --> 00:44:38,858
Hi there!

605
00:44:40,915 --> 00:44:42,663
Are you... Ryuzaki...?

606
00:44:50,964 --> 00:44:53,384
Nice to meet you.
I'm Amane Misa

607
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:58,190
Um... Light?
Your friend is a little weird

608
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,385
He's just shy

609
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:06,638
I envy you Light

610
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:12,601
I listen to your Heaven's Door!

611
00:45:12,915 --> 00:45:15,667
Really?
I'm so glad!

612
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:20,482
Light, why can you date with such a cute pop star?

613
00:45:20,895 --> 00:45:23,003
I approached him first

614
00:45:23,038 --> 00:45:24,468
Misa!

615
00:45:24,469 --> 00:45:26,241
Look, isn't that Misa-Misa?

616
00:45:27,905 --> 00:45:29,372
She really is!

617
00:45:30,905 --> 00:45:32,875
Why! Why is she here?

618
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:36,915
This is great

619
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,885
It's real

620
00:45:43,588 --> 00:45:47,619
You're the most intelligent students in Japan, right?

621
00:45:47,654 --> 00:45:49,073
Please shake hands with me

622
00:45:51,286 --> 00:45:54,010
Oh! Someone touched my bottom!

623
00:45:54,905 --> 00:45:56,363
Can't forgive him!

624
00:45:57,353 --> 00:46:00,221
I, the greatest detective, will definitely catch the pervert!

625
00:46:00,905 --> 00:46:01,706
Here you go

626
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,093
Ryuzaki, you're funny

627
00:46:05,103 --> 00:46:08,103
Then, don't you want to date with me?

628
00:46:08,915 --> 00:46:11,607
Too bad, here's my only sweet heart

629
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:13,552
Whaaat?

630
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:16,317
I have a class, so go back to your work

631
00:46:16,738 --> 00:46:17,563
Right

632
00:46:17,925 --> 00:46:20,497
Sorry, but I'm glad to see you

633
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:22,333
See you soon, Light

634
00:46:30,905 --> 00:46:32,905
It's good...

635
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,875
She's so cute

636
00:46:38,915 --> 00:46:40,204
Ryuzaki

637
00:46:40,915 --> 00:46:42,566
She's my girlfriend

638
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:44,519
bye

639
00:46:45,364 --> 00:46:46,879
It was lucky to see Misa-Misa.

640
00:46:45,925 --> 00:46:47,895
I'll go back to the office

641
00:46:49,925 --> 00:46:50,758
Take care

642
00:46:57,905 --> 00:46:58,864
I won...!

643
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:05,418
"Misa"

644
00:47:19,925 --> 00:47:21,011
Hello

645
00:47:25,935 --> 00:47:28,345
What are you doing?

646
00:47:31,905 --> 00:47:35,865
Someone dropped this cell phone and I picked it up

647
00:47:36,915 --> 00:47:38,496
It belongs to Misa

648
00:47:39,614 --> 00:47:40,936
Give it to me

649
00:47:52,935 --> 00:47:55,820
Calling her just after you said goodbye?

650
00:47:56,354 --> 00:47:58,419
You really are in love with her
Or,

651
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,999
Was there anything you had to ask her immediately

652
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,768
Hello

653
00:48:12,021 --> 00:48:13,637
We have the target.

654
00:48:14,677 --> 00:48:16,677
It wasn't the place we expected

655
00:48:16,925 --> 00:48:18,341
since she moved around so much

656
00:48:18,925 --> 00:48:21,364
We'll send her to the office

657
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:24,559
I got it
Thank you for the hard work

658
00:48:26,935 --> 00:48:28,046
Just now

659
00:48:28,047 --> 00:48:32,056
We arrested Amane Misa for the suspicion to be the Second Kira

660
00:48:32,945 --> 00:48:33,908
What?

661
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:41,365
She is an enthusiastic supporter of Kira and she was in the studio that day

662
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:43,858
From her room,

663
00:48:42,925 --> 00:48:45,925
We found material evidences such as a cosmetic powder

664
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,925
and fibers matching her clothes

665
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:52,808
We're not going to announce so please cooperate for awhile

666
00:48:54,038 --> 00:48:57,080
You have to stay away from the office

667
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,318
What are you going to do to her?

668
00:48:59,722 --> 00:49:03,718
I can't tell you.
Can I take her phone too?

669
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:08,221
I can't believe she's the Kira

670
00:49:09,955 --> 00:49:10,149
It can't be

671
00:49:15,231 --> 00:49:16,871
Awwww, Light

672
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,798
The goddess of the luck is gone

673
00:49:22,368 --> 00:49:23,497
See you

674
00:50:10,955 --> 00:50:11,635
Ryuzaki

675
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:15,702
Do we really have to do this?

676
00:50:16,468 --> 00:50:18,901
Second Kira can kill by seeing the face

677
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:22,850
It's reasonable to restrain her with a 24 hour surveillance

678
00:50:24,046 --> 00:50:27,046
If she isn't Kira...

679
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:28,588
This will violate human rights

680
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,472
We've got the evidence!

681
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:33,945
Besides she stays silent even in this situation

682
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,945
If she's innocent, why doesn't she just say so

683
00:50:38,514 --> 00:50:40,514
Tell her agent to announce

684
00:50:38,955 --> 00:50:42,437
that she's in hospital

685
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:44,549
It's already done

686
00:50:46,112 --> 00:50:47,094
Mr. Yagami

687
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,334
Amane and Light have a close relationship

688
00:50:52,993 --> 00:50:53,695
What?

689
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,335
She's even visited your home, Mr. Yagami

690
00:50:58,993 --> 00:51:00,596
Light...

691
00:51:05,003 --> 00:51:07,003
I have to contact Rem

692
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:09,499
before Misa talks them about the secrets...

693
00:51:10,003 --> 00:51:11,956
It's gonna get worse

694
00:51:12,443 --> 00:51:16,403
We can't part from the owner of the Death Note

695
00:51:19,013 --> 00:51:22,276
Unless the owner abandons the right of possession or...

696
00:51:22,925 --> 00:51:24,571
dies

697
00:51:41,013 --> 00:51:44,659
She hasn't eaten anything in 2 days

698
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:48,364
She has a lot of guts..
She doesn't even complain

699
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:52,011
I'm... becoming a fan of her

700
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:54,659
I'm going to buy her CD

701
00:51:55,174 --> 00:51:55,994
Idiot!

702
00:51:57,652 --> 00:51:59,148
Toilet...

703
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:02,273
I want to use the toilet

704
00:52:09,272 --> 00:52:10,192
Even after she got caught,

705
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:12,574
Kira hasn't stopped punishing

706
00:52:17,686 --> 00:52:18,428
Here

707
00:52:21,696 --> 00:52:23,020
Misa

708
00:52:26,196 --> 00:52:28,206
Please...

709
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:30,166
Say something...

710
00:52:32,176 --> 00:52:33,836
We don't want to..

711
00:52:33,837 --> 00:52:36,523
make you suffer anymore

712
00:52:40,186 --> 00:52:41,369
What do you...

713
00:52:42,183 --> 00:52:44,032
know about Kira?

714
00:52:47,186 --> 00:52:48,776
I can't stand this anymore

715
00:52:49,196 --> 00:52:50,717
kill me

716
00:52:52,196 --> 00:52:54,024
kill me

717
00:52:56,196 --> 00:52:58,137
We must release her!

718
00:52:59,206 --> 00:53:01,431
Amane Misa, do you hear me?

719
00:53:02,206 --> 00:53:04,176
Please

720
00:53:05,176 --> 00:53:07,146
kill me

721
00:53:11,186 --> 00:53:14,559
Do you mean that you admit you're the Second Kira?

722
00:53:15,069 --> 00:53:17,271
It doesn't matter if I'm Kira or not

723
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,658
If I have to live like this...

724
00:53:24,695 --> 00:53:26,245
I'd rather die

725
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:31,141
Hey!

726
00:53:33,561 --> 00:53:35,309
kill me now

727
00:53:38,109 --> 00:53:40,899
You're able to kill me easily!

728
00:53:44,247 --> 00:53:48,104
I should have died that time anyway

729
00:53:51,196 --> 00:53:53,489
I'm happy even if I die now

730
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:59,578
kill me before I get old and lose my beauty

731
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:04,176
kill me right now

732
00:54:19,196 --> 00:54:21,196
Rem..

733
00:54:21,231 --> 00:54:24,764
Misa abandoned the possessive right of the Death Note

734
00:54:26,706 --> 00:54:29,754
She asked me to kill her

735
00:54:30,424 --> 00:54:32,492
because she didn't want you to get in trouble

736
00:54:32,527 --> 00:54:35,197
Do you understand, Yagami Light?

737
00:54:36,177 --> 00:54:38,758
Everything she did was to be loved by you

738
00:54:40,186 --> 00:54:41,124
Did she...

739
00:54:42,703 --> 00:54:45,910
lose all the memory about the Death Note?

740
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:47,177
Of course

741
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:49,519
She forgot that she has killed people

742
00:54:49,196 --> 00:54:52,561
or that you are Kira

743
00:54:53,893 --> 00:54:56,270
I told her that she'd never see me anymore

744
00:54:56,305 --> 00:55:01,438
and all she'd remember is that she loves Yagami Light

745
00:55:02,256 --> 00:55:05,333
Misa answered it would be fine

746
00:55:10,216 --> 00:55:12,878
Save her at all cost!

747
00:55:13,216 --> 00:55:16,139
If you don't, I'll kill you

748
00:55:17,226 --> 00:55:19,810
With a Death God being so nice to her..

749
00:55:20,889 --> 00:55:22,431
Misa must be very happy

750
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:26,639
I am just trying to keep the promise with Jealous

751
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:30,675
Jealous£¿

752
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:35,003
Jealous was always looking down on Misa

753
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:40,147
He had a father-like sympathy towards the girl who lost her parents

754
00:55:40,914 --> 00:55:44,896
However, when the time comes when Misa would die

755
00:55:46,334 --> 00:55:50,657
Eventually, he broke the rules of the Death Gods

756
00:55:51,196 --> 00:55:54,196
He wrote the name of the man

757
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:57,810
and extended Misa's lifespan

758
00:55:58,206 --> 00:56:03,660
The Death Gods exist only to take lives of humans

759
00:56:04,206 --> 00:56:06,216
It's a serious taboo to save a human

760
00:56:06,251 --> 00:56:09,394
and extend her lifespan

761
00:56:10,216 --> 00:56:12,820
Jealous fell to pieces and died

762
00:56:13,967 --> 00:56:17,078
asking me to take care of her

763
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,640
Therefore

764
00:56:19,229 --> 00:56:21,598
Jealous's Death Note was given to Misa

765
00:56:23,236 --> 00:56:27,166
A Death God who falls in love with a human shall die...

766
00:56:31,206 --> 00:56:33,206
a great story, indeed

767
00:56:34,229 --> 00:56:36,239
If you won't save Misa,

768
00:56:35,216 --> 00:56:37,176
I will kill you

769
00:56:38,216 --> 00:56:41,204
Don't give me the same phrase over and over again, Rem

770
00:56:41,977 --> 00:56:44,237
Imagine how she feels if I die

771
00:56:45,724 --> 00:56:47,587
She'll definitely kill herself

772
00:56:49,226 --> 00:56:51,295
Can't you even imagine that?

773
00:56:56,064 --> 00:56:57,436
There's a way

774
00:57:00,819 --> 00:57:02,663
It needs a lot of work though..

775
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,286
Are you really sure that it will save Misa

776
00:57:10,321 --> 00:57:13,034
if only I follow your direction

777
00:57:13,216 --> 00:57:15,157
Can't you trust me even a little?

778
00:57:15,192 --> 00:57:18,618
He's smarter than you think

779
00:57:19,226 --> 00:57:21,409
Ok, I trust you

780
00:57:22,226 --> 00:57:23,642
Yagami Light

781
00:57:24,254 --> 00:57:25,901
I leave Misa to you

782
00:57:34,206 --> 00:57:36,984
What are you doing with my Death Note?

783
00:57:37,382 --> 00:57:38,909
I'm just hiding it

784
00:57:39,825 --> 00:57:43,499
When I discard its possession, I'll say...

785
00:57:45,037 --> 00:57:46,363
"I discard it"

786
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,898
"I discard it"...
hum....

787
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:55,236
Hey stalker

788
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,236
If you quit now,

789
00:57:57,271 --> 00:57:59,319
I won't accuse you!

790
00:58:00,984 --> 00:58:04,060
I'll give you my autograph and a kiss!

791
00:58:05,906 --> 00:58:07,906
Oh please!

792
00:58:07,216 --> 00:58:09,216
Let me out of here!

793
00:58:10,372 --> 00:58:12,001
What happened to her during the blackout

794
00:58:12,036 --> 00:58:13,001
She kept repeating..

795
00:58:15,546 --> 00:58:18,093
We are not stalkers.

796
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:19,065
We are the police

797
00:58:19,888 --> 00:58:22,898
The police can't do such a thing!

798
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:25,898
Pop stars are wiser than you think!

799
00:58:25,933 --> 00:58:27,898
If you think we are stalkers,

800
00:58:27,933 --> 00:58:29,898
why did you keep silent?

801
00:58:29,933 --> 00:58:31,827
I don't know!

802
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,908
You suddenly caught me

803
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,908
when I was just going to have lunch with Light

804
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,919
Do you admit the relationship between Yagmai Light?

805
00:58:39,954 --> 00:58:40,878
Of course...

806
00:58:40,913 --> 00:58:42,953
Of course I do. He's my boyfriend.

807
00:58:44,557 --> 00:58:46,602
Is she really the same person?

808
00:58:47,368 --> 00:58:49,520
Then how, did you and Light know each other?

809
00:58:49,555 --> 00:58:53,042
I fell in love with him at first sight at Sakura TV station

810
00:58:53,553 --> 00:58:56,187
I found his address and went to his home

811
00:58:57,941 --> 00:58:59,072
Anything wrong?

812
00:59:01,743 --> 00:59:03,629
You know how she acted before

813
00:59:04,482 --> 00:59:07,011
Now she frankly admitted about Light

814
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:08,726
I'm confused

815
00:59:17,247 --> 00:59:19,716
Who said that we can't bring cellphones into the office?

816
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:20,547
ya..

817
00:59:21,282 --> 00:59:22,195
Hello

818
00:59:24,384 --> 00:59:26,173
I got it, please come in

819
00:59:27,683 --> 00:59:31,396
Keep recording and shut down the screen

820
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:31,868
Yes

821
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,834
Is someone coming?

822
00:59:40,918 --> 00:59:42,986
Light!

823
00:59:45,796 --> 00:59:47,735
I've told Ryuzaki but...

824
00:59:49,365 --> 00:59:51,365
As L said, I might be the Kira

825
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,767
What on earth are you talking about?

826
00:59:54,898 --> 00:59:56,790
I've been thinking that..

827
00:59:57,843 --> 01:00:01,004
It may be better if people who committed serious crimes die

828
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:03,139
So it's possible that I may become Kira

829
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,945
You're not the only one who thinks so!

830
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:07,582
Are you trying to cover Misa?

831
01:00:08,594 --> 01:00:13,224
I don't know much about her yet since we've just started dating

832
01:00:13,598 --> 01:00:15,594
I can't believe that she's Kira

833
01:00:16,426 --> 01:00:18,346
Of course, I'm not conscious of Kira in me

834
01:00:18,347 --> 01:00:19,683
but,

835
01:00:20,481 --> 01:00:22,535
I might have a multiple personality

836
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,905
I want you to figure it out

837
01:00:24,906 --> 01:00:27,334
We investigated you, but couldn't find anything suspicious

838
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:30,235
But we watched over him only when he was home

839
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:33,444
We don't know exactly what he did outside

840
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:37,715
Then tie his arms and legs and keep him under surveillance

841
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:38,627
This time

842
01:00:40,364 --> 01:00:42,641
It's an around-the-clock surveillance

843
01:00:44,011 --> 01:00:45,625
That'll be fine with me

844
01:00:46,657 --> 01:00:48,213
But if,

845
01:00:48,704 --> 01:00:51,743
new crimes are committed while I'm under surveillance...

846
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,081
and Kira punishes the criminals

847
01:00:54,927 --> 01:00:56,043
When it happens

848
01:00:56,706 --> 01:00:58,845
We'll certainly free you

849
01:01:01,804 --> 01:01:02,647
Thank you

850
01:01:11,124 --> 01:01:11,730
Light...

851
01:01:13,325 --> 01:01:14,441
Do you really mean it?

852
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,321
Where's Light?

853
01:01:39,094 --> 01:01:41,499
What happened to our son?

854
01:01:42,097 --> 01:01:44,079
Dad, why don't you say something?

855
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:45,379
Dear

856
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,818
"Celebrating LIght's 18th birthday"

857
01:02:40,657 --> 01:02:44,322
"This is a rulebook which was based on human wisdom"

858
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:46,990
"which still struggles to answer what justice is"

859
01:02:47,395 --> 01:02:48,459
"Thanks, dad!"

860
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,081
"I want to study and think about what justice is"

861
01:02:56,105 --> 01:03:01,129
Amane Misa: Surveillance Day 8

862
01:03:02,601 --> 01:03:03,604
Yagami Light: Surveillance Day 3

863
01:03:05,934 --> 01:03:07,389
How is it, Ryuzaki?

864
01:03:09,084 --> 01:03:11,632
Has kira killed anyone yet?

865
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:16,759
There's no activities so far

866
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:20,485
No criminals have been killed

867
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:22,744
Is that so...

868
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,488
Then I'm getting even more suspicious.

869
01:03:29,567 --> 01:03:31,682
I'm soooo bored!

870
01:03:32,107 --> 01:03:33,670
I can't eat apples

871
01:03:34,109 --> 01:03:36,275
and I can't even talk with you.

872
01:03:37,112 --> 01:03:39,841
I wonder how Rem's doing now

873
01:04:16,084 --> 01:04:19,856
Where's my ID card?

874
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:22,121
Does anyone know?

875
01:05:01,526 --> 01:05:03,139
Don't make a sound

876
01:05:03,857 --> 01:05:06,537
I brought a little gift for you

877
01:05:10,105 --> 01:05:12,107
Misa. Day 12
Light: Day 7

878
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:14,075
I want to see Light

879
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:17,112
I want to see Light, stalkers!

880
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:19,046
Dad, mom

881
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,136
Light,

882
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,352
You look exhausted

883
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:27,840
Are you okay?

884
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,667
Yeah, I know I look so miserable right now

885
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,820
But I don't care about such as useless pride..

886
01:05:39,056 --> 01:05:39,775
"I discard it"

887
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,170
You "discard" it?

888
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:45,896
You'll lose your memory

889
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,076
Alright, Light.

890
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,045
Goodbye

891
01:06:13,927 --> 01:06:14,749
Ryuzaki...

892
01:06:16,561 --> 01:06:17,406
What's wrong?

893
01:06:19,107 --> 01:06:22,094
I know I asked you to do this to me

894
01:06:23,111 --> 01:06:25,053
But now I surely know..

895
01:06:26,992 --> 01:06:28,396
This is a waste of time

896
01:06:29,746 --> 01:06:31,317
I'm not Kira

897
01:06:32,076 --> 01:06:35,207
I'll be the judge of that, not you

898
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,272
It's totally impossible to do such cruel things

899
01:06:38,307 --> 01:06:40,067
without being conscious

900
01:06:41,678 --> 01:06:42,605
Don't you think so?

901
01:06:43,745 --> 01:06:46,388
It was you who said that you might be Kira

902
01:06:47,123 --> 01:06:48,942
without being conscious

903
01:06:49,283 --> 01:06:51,276
While I'm here, I clearly saw my goal

904
01:06:51,986 --> 01:06:54,776
I won't let Kira go free, he drove me into a corner

905
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:56,497
Ryuzaki!

906
01:06:56,498 --> 01:06:59,342
Let's cooperate and find a way to reach Kira!

907
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:03,717
We can get him!

908
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:08,061
Light...
suddenly became so positive

909
01:07:25,286 --> 01:07:27,843
Misa: Day 19
Light: Day 14

910
01:07:28,064 --> 01:07:30,760
Since he offered to do it, but

911
01:07:31,444 --> 01:07:33,096
I'm worried about Misa

912
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:38,891
She's a tough kid

913
01:07:39,452 --> 01:07:41,323
If I were her, I'd go insane

914
01:07:49,297 --> 01:07:49,900
Ryuzaki!

915
01:07:51,636 --> 01:07:52,584
Kira is back!

916
01:07:53,638 --> 01:07:55,930
Criminals are dying of heart attack one after another

917
01:07:58,643 --> 01:07:59,202
Light!

918
01:08:00,198 --> 01:08:02,946
There's been no action from Kira for 2 weeks.

919
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,430
It's time you admit that you're Kira

920
01:08:05,465 --> 01:08:06,148
Hey!

921
01:08:08,267 --> 01:08:11,559
If you see only the current situation, I'm guilty. But this is a trap...

922
01:08:13,098 --> 01:08:15,649
I said I'm not Kira!
Believe me!

923
01:08:39,877 --> 01:08:42,424
Why did Kira... choose me as his replacement?

924
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:47,499
You often predicted who'll be the next target of Kira

925
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:51,729
You must have noticed the reason through your reports

926
01:08:59,937 --> 01:09:01,939
Kira's punishment...

927
01:09:01,974 --> 01:09:04,942
...is nearly the same as my view on justice

928
01:09:05,448 --> 01:09:06,527
That's what I thought

929
01:09:13,765 --> 01:09:16,373
Kira is just trying to make the world a better place

930
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,320
It's my mission to tell the people that he's doing the right thing

931
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:23,831
If I were Kira, I would use the media more efficiently!

932
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:29,952
That makes you the most suitable person as Kira's partner

933
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:31,890
That is the reason

934
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:34,965
Kira chose me as his partner...

935
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:50,876
Misa: Day 23
Light: Day 18

936
01:09:52,936 --> 01:09:56,486
Criminals are constantly being killed

937
01:09:57,928 --> 01:09:59,930
Even the ones they never knew

938
01:09:59,965 --> 01:10:03,752
It's impossible to kill them in this situation

939
01:10:06,937 --> 01:10:08,353
For example,

940
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,936
if the Kira's ability has been transferred to another person

941
01:10:11,758 --> 01:10:13,701
and the person has become the Third Kira

942
01:10:14,266 --> 01:10:16,724
and they've lost their memories

943
01:10:16,947 --> 01:10:18,582
It explains everything

944
01:10:19,426 --> 01:10:20,257
Even if you were right,

945
01:10:20,899 --> 01:10:22,532
there's no way to prove it

946
01:10:28,636 --> 01:10:29,404
Ryuzaki

947
01:10:32,678 --> 01:10:35,243
Why don't we try a different approach?

948
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:53,912
How do you feel?

949
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:58,902
Good, thanks

950
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:01,061
I'm impressed with your courage

951
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:06,479
Still, we have the evidence found in Amane's room

952
01:11:07,086 --> 01:11:11,399
You can't go outside until we solve the case

953
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,972
If I have to stay here anyway

954
01:11:15,033 --> 01:11:17,923
Let me go back to the team and help you find Kira

955
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:21,660
Yes, I was thinking about the exact same thing

956
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:27,808
You have to stay with me all day and assist me

957
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:30,551
Thanks, Ryuzaki

958
01:11:31,853 --> 01:11:33,379
Let's find Kira together

959
01:11:42,136 --> 01:11:43,231
I love you...

960
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:45,690
Light

961
01:12:00,194 --> 01:12:01,896
Ms Wakita!
Are you okay?

962
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:03,137
What happened to you?

963
01:12:03,822 --> 01:12:04,734
Get an ambulance!

964
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:12,215
She's dead

965
01:12:13,532 --> 01:12:16,935
Her name is Wakita Masako and she was wanted for

966
01:12:17,165 --> 01:12:19,765
killing her colleague when she was working in a nightclub

967
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:21,973
Is this another case

968
01:12:21,974 --> 01:12:24,437
of punishment from Kira?

969
01:12:25,173 --> 01:12:31,322
We found Wakita's address and tried to interview her

970
01:12:31,522 --> 01:12:33,314
but she died in front of us

971
01:12:34,066 --> 01:12:36,471
Ms. Takada, you must be shocked

972
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,154
She did not have any health problem

973
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:43,113
so it is natural to think that she was killed by Kira

974
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:46,477
Now please look at this graph

975
01:12:47,452 --> 01:12:50,634
This is the result of a poll taken from 1000 people in Japan

976
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:53,168
According to the result,

977
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:55,649
60% of them are supporting Kira

978
01:12:55,684 --> 01:12:57,137
This is surprising isn't it?

979
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:58,508
I don't think so

980
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,176
Considering that the crime rate has been decreasing

981
01:13:03,983 --> 01:13:06,137
by the appearance of Kira, this result is expected

982
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,119
Not bad

983
01:13:12,702 --> 01:13:15,529
This is a fact that Kira is fighting against evil

984
01:13:16,929 --> 01:13:19,106
What is the true justice?

985
01:13:20,052 --> 01:13:22,225
Does the police, or L, really can help us?

986
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:24,684
Kira is trying to make us thing.

987
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,758
She's good

988
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:31,191
We can't blame her because

989
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:35,635
We haven't found any clues to go on

990
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:39,123
What's wrong Ryuzaki?
It's not like you

991
01:13:40,673 --> 01:13:42,641
Oh, great work!

992
01:13:44,204 --> 01:13:45,217
Thank you for supervising

993
01:13:45,505 --> 01:13:46,992
Your comments were witty

994
01:13:48,944 --> 01:13:49,942
Thank you so much!

995
01:13:51,109 --> 01:13:52,519
The director said that...

996
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:55,065
you'd be a good anchor

997
01:13:55,741 --> 01:13:56,385
Really?

998
01:13:57,187 --> 01:14:00,321
for being critical towards the society through Kira's case...

999
01:14:00,744 --> 01:14:03,877
Your brave, intelligent attitude has attracted the viewers.

1000
01:14:05,798 --> 01:14:07,940
You're becoming more attractive

1001
01:14:09,042 --> 01:14:10,029
Mr. Demegawa!

1002
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:15,121
Could you ask your boss?

1003
01:14:16,131 --> 01:14:18,147
to spray pesticide in the studio

1004
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,115
since a noisy bug's flying around here

1005
01:14:21,736 --> 01:14:22,885
Saeko!

1006
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:24,490
Let's go have dinner?

1007
01:14:27,007 --> 01:14:27,836
Kiyomi

1008
01:14:28,754 --> 01:14:30,840
You know, each employee has an appropriate role, right?

1009
01:14:31,127 --> 01:14:32,466
What is your role, then?

1010
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:35,923
No one's listening to your trashy comments!

1011
01:14:36,818 --> 01:14:37,543
Let's go

1012
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:48,209
I say she's too fugly to be the anchor for our show!

1013
01:14:48,718 --> 01:14:49,810
Oh, come on

1014
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,972
We employees can't say no to your boss, you know.

1015
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:54,934
Are you kidding me?

1016
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:57,920
You're the one who said no to your boss and showed Kira's video!

1017
01:14:59,005 --> 01:15:00,420
You slept with her, didn't you?

1018
01:15:01,677 --> 01:15:04,997
There's nobody but you who got a job by sleeping with me

1019
01:15:06,982 --> 01:15:07,962
Stop the car

1020
01:15:07,963 --> 01:15:08,931
Huh?

1021
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,598
Stop the car now!

1022
01:15:19,564 --> 01:15:20,923
I'll never forgive her!

1023
01:15:22,173 --> 01:15:22,913
Hey, wait!

1024
01:15:23,902 --> 01:15:24,821
Calm down!

1025
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,557
What's the matter with you!

1026
01:15:31,518 --> 01:15:33,693
You can't catch a taxi here!

1027
01:15:49,716 --> 01:15:50,810
Good evening

1028
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:55,012
Good evening

1029
01:15:55,459 --> 01:15:58,832
Welcome to Evening Spot,
I'm Takada Kiyomi, the new anchor

1030
01:16:00,627 --> 01:16:01,569
First of all,

1031
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:04,853
I have to announce a sad news

1032
01:16:06,665 --> 01:16:10,669
Last night, Nishiyama Saeko, our excellent former anchor,

1033
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:12,730
died of a car accident

1034
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:16,137
She was, for me..

1035
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:18,784
a few years senior than me

1036
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:22,595
and one of the person I respected the most

1037
01:16:24,587 --> 01:16:27,556
It is very sad that...

1038
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:30,517
my first job as an anchor is

1039
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:33,720
to announce about Saeko's death

1040
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:41,157
This feels like being on a honeymoon!

1041
01:16:43,164 --> 01:16:46,167
If I can always spend my time with you like this

1042
01:16:46,202 --> 01:16:48,283
I won't want to go back to work

1043
01:16:51,172 --> 01:16:56,230
But, if they lock me up again, I'll die!

1044
01:16:57,829 --> 01:16:58,635
Oh, sorry!

1045
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:04,504
Light

1046
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:05,793
Are you studying?

1047
01:17:05,828 --> 01:17:08,206
Sorry Misa, can you please leave me alone for a while?

1048
01:17:26,579 --> 01:17:27,590
I'll go downstairs

1049
01:17:28,523 --> 01:17:29,498
Dont leave me alone

1050
01:17:35,672 --> 01:17:37,632
Light, come back soon, okay?

1051
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,955
I'm sorry, but I'll set you free soon

1052
01:17:55,547 --> 01:17:57,415
Ryuzaki is a little depressed

1053
01:17:58,103 --> 01:18:00,583
Yeah, because he lost all his clues...

1054
01:18:02,639 --> 01:18:04,067
You're too loud

1055
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:05,430
Ryuzaki!

1056
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:07,160
Please be honest

1057
01:18:07,618 --> 01:18:09,752
What is the percentage that I'm Kira?

1058
01:18:11,152 --> 01:18:14,272
The percentage that you are Kira is...

1059
01:18:15,043 --> 01:18:16,033
nearly zero

1060
01:18:16,941 --> 01:18:17,419
I see

1061
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:19,901
Great

1062
01:18:20,545 --> 01:18:21,296
I'm so happy

1063
01:18:22,163 --> 01:18:26,167
I'm also happy that you don't seem to be Kira, but

1064
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:29,676
at the same time I lost all the clues

1065
01:18:31,127 --> 01:18:32,754
There's a vital clue

1066
01:18:33,721 --> 01:18:34,604
What if I said so?

1067
01:18:36,275 --> 01:18:37,834
When will you come back?

1068
01:18:38,179 --> 01:18:39,365
Are you serious?

1069
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:41,000
Look at this

1070
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:47,819
The red one is Kira's action before I was confined

1071
01:18:48,538 --> 01:18:49,841
and the blue one is his new action.

1072
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:53,008
I profiled them statistically

1073
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:56,159
Are these the same person?

1074
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:57,148
No

1075
01:18:57,484 --> 01:18:59,159
They have some differences

1076
01:19:05,545 --> 01:19:06,742
Oh, they really do!

1077
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:11,179
Even if you try to imitate someone's movement

1078
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:13,097
you can't hide your habits or personality

1079
01:19:14,113 --> 01:19:16,650
They appear to be a remarkable tendency

1080
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:18,329
Ryuzaki...

1081
01:19:19,029 --> 01:19:20,187
He's got the energy again!

1082
01:19:20,382 --> 01:19:21,317
I bet you know it

1083
01:19:22,433 --> 01:19:25,370
If Kira before and after the restraint were the same person

1084
01:19:25,405 --> 01:19:27,644
THe distribution wouldn't be so different

1085
01:19:28,789 --> 01:19:31,097
It means that they are different person and

1086
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,772
we can see the distinct characterists that show their tendencies

1087
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,115
How is it , Ryuzaki?

1088
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:37,888
Doesn't it give you some motivation?

1089
01:19:39,009 --> 01:19:40,970
Yes Light, that you so much

1090
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:43,673
By the way, what are the characteristics?

1091
01:19:44,893 --> 01:19:47,628
Well, the first characteristic is publicity

1092
01:19:47,862 --> 01:19:52,491
I mean, the new Kira cares slightly more about cases featured by the media

1093
01:19:53,425 --> 01:19:55,098
And the second factor is

1094
01:19:55,133 --> 01:19:56,676
gender

1095
01:19:56,871 --> 01:20:01,513
The new one focuses on more cases related to women

1096
01:20:02,414 --> 01:20:03,992
This Kira may be a woman

1097
01:20:04,695 --> 01:20:06,164
And the third factor is...

1098
01:20:07,582 --> 01:20:10,055
which might be the answer already

1099
01:20:10,585 --> 01:20:11,915
What? Oh come one Light, tell us

1100
01:20:12,089 --> 01:20:15,421
frequency of the cases reported by one broadcasting company

1101
01:20:16,266 --> 01:20:17,964
Which company?

1102
01:20:19,561 --> 01:20:20,753
It's Sakura TV

1103
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:26,568
To sum up

1104
01:20:27,438 --> 01:20:30,531
compared to the First Kira, this new Kira is

1105
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:36,441
more media-oriented, feminine, and Sakura TV...

1106
01:20:38,799 --> 01:20:41,842
The anchor died of accident and the new one is female!

1107
01:21:53,318 --> 01:21:56,355
Does she keep a diary in such an old notebook?

1108
01:21:53,318 --> 01:21:54,974
That's not snobbish people do

1109
01:21:55,373 --> 01:21:56,665
She must have a lot of money

1110
01:21:57,118 --> 01:22:00,847
I don't think it's a diary. SHe's copying down from the PC screen

1111
01:22:02,028 --> 01:22:03,848
Can you zoom in the surface of the notebook?

1112
01:22:03,883 --> 01:22:05,533
Okay, wait a second

1113
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:18,530
What are these£¿

1114
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:23,789
Names of the criminals who've just been killed by Kira

1115
01:22:23,824 --> 01:22:28,245
Ms. Sagami, capture them and confirm that they are

1116
01:22:28,949 --> 01:22:29,833
Yes

1117
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,531
Killing one after another everyday

1118
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:38,564
Are there any left to kill?

1119
01:22:39,466 --> 01:22:41,760
It tells you how sinful human beings are

1120
01:22:42,929 --> 01:22:45,487
Look who's talking

1121
01:22:45,522 --> 01:22:46,506
I know

1122
01:22:47,453 --> 01:22:49,655
Punishing the sinful people, I'm even more sinful

1123
01:22:50,792 --> 01:22:53,362
But even those sins burden me for my entire life

1124
01:22:53,688 --> 01:22:55,117
I have to fulfill my duty

1125
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:57,167
Is she talking to herself?

1126
01:22:57,343 --> 01:22:57,913
No,

1127
01:22:58,758 --> 01:23:00,345
She's definitely talking to someone else

1128
01:23:06,103 --> 01:23:07,325
It's confirmed

1129
01:23:08,462 --> 01:23:10,715
Names of the left page belong to the criminals

1130
01:23:11,566 --> 01:23:13,980
who died of heart attack yesterday

1131
01:23:14,721 --> 01:23:16,276
Accurate details of when and how they died..

1132
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:18,759
including the unannounced cases

1133
01:23:19,421 --> 01:23:20,818
We got it!

1134
01:23:21,369 --> 01:23:23,420
Boss! Let me arrest her!

1135
01:23:23,594 --> 01:23:26,675
She can make an excuse that she was just researching their deaths

1136
01:23:27,997 --> 01:23:29,024
You're right...

1137
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:29,941
One more thing

1138
01:23:30,889 --> 01:23:34,079
What she's writing down on the right page now..

1139
01:23:34,436 --> 01:23:36,128
are also names of the criminals

1140
01:23:37,105 --> 01:23:39,037
but they are still alive

1141
01:23:41,093 --> 01:23:43,445
They must be the next targets

1142
01:23:44,743 --> 01:23:47,582
If they really die tomorrow, we can conclude that she's Kira

1143
01:23:48,324 --> 01:23:51,710
or she has some kind of relationship with Kira

1144
01:23:52,323 --> 01:23:54,378
We can't just wait until those people die!

1145
01:23:55,365 --> 01:23:57,095
Damn it, what should we do!

1146
01:23:57,603 --> 01:23:59,145
We can use Kira's cruelty

1147
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:03,645
Hello, Ms. Takada

1148
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:08,524
You keep getting scoops about Kira as a supporter

1149
01:24:09,816 --> 01:24:12,454
I found out the reasons

1150
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:14,019
What do you mean?

1151
01:24:14,787 --> 01:24:17,184
I peeked in your room

1152
01:24:18,791 --> 01:24:20,162
It's illegal!

1153
01:24:20,197 --> 01:24:23,542
Every secret is hidden in your black notebook, right?

1154
01:24:24,121 --> 01:24:25,885
I want you to buy the tapes

1155
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:27,545
for 5 million yen

1156
01:25:08,351 --> 01:25:10,353
All the names she wrote down yesterday...

1157
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:12,584
matches the criminals who died today.

1158
01:25:13,111 --> 01:25:14,878
Takada Kiyomi is the Kira!

1159
01:25:15,113 --> 01:25:16,241
She definitely is!

1160
01:25:27,092 --> 01:25:28,245
I'm the one who called you

1161
01:25:35,392 --> 01:25:36,382
"Miatsuo Yosuke"

1162
01:25:36,417 --> 01:25:40,691
If I die, the tapes will automatically go public

1163
01:25:41,431 --> 01:25:44,434
Are you doing this with someone else?

1164
01:25:44,109 --> 01:25:45,704
No, I'm alone

1165
01:25:48,868 --> 01:25:51,833
There's my account number on the back of the card

1166
01:25:52,117 --> 01:25:55,093
Transfer 5 million yen to my account

1167
01:25:56,087 --> 01:25:58,089
Once payment is confirmed

1168
01:25:58,124 --> 01:25:59,802
I'll give you the tapes

1169
01:26:01,092 --> 01:26:02,558
Thank you

1170
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:11,168
It's me. Kiyomi. turn on the TV

1171
01:26:11,398 --> 01:26:12,410
Sakura TV

1172
01:26:13,104 --> 01:26:14,061
Why?

1173
01:26:14,603 --> 01:26:16,217
No reason, just turn on the TV

1174
01:26:22,204 --> 01:26:24,560
Kira is a woman?

1175
01:26:25,116 --> 01:26:27,587
Wow, I couldn't think of it

1176
01:26:27,825 --> 01:26:28,544
"Special Program: Chasing Kira's Identity"

1177
01:26:28,977 --> 01:26:31,277
I have the tapes as evidence

1178
01:26:31,485 --> 01:26:33,959
Wait, It's too soon to show them

1179
01:26:35,093 --> 01:26:37,957
We'll show you the videos at the end of the program

1180
01:26:39,097 --> 01:26:40,745
You'll see Kira's identity

1181
01:26:41,918 --> 01:26:44,473
1 hour 25 minutes and 40 seconds left

1182
01:26:45,103 --> 01:26:47,513
until then, we'll ask our guests some more questions

1183
01:26:47,548 --> 01:26:49,786
We were scooped by other guys

1184
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,045
I'm sorry...
I'll call you back

1185
01:26:54,112 --> 01:26:55,048
"that female..."

1186
01:26:58,718 --> 01:26:59,925
I did it as you said

1187
01:27:00,969 --> 01:27:01,984
You're a good actor

1188
01:27:11,033 --> 01:27:12,047
Now, what do we do next?

1189
01:27:17,677 --> 01:27:20,107
"Matsuo Yosuke suicide"

1190
01:27:21,105 --> 01:27:23,697
22:36, refuses to appear on the program

1191
01:27:26,131 --> 01:27:29,701
after cleaning out all the evidences he has

1192
01:27:30,587 --> 01:27:33,009
jumps from the roof of the building

1193
01:27:35,677 --> 01:27:37,147
she's writing down how he's going to die

1194
01:27:38,089 --> 01:27:40,572
Kira can control the action of the people she's going to kill!

1195
01:27:42,869 --> 01:27:44,458
It's safe, Rem

1196
01:27:45,999 --> 01:27:46,992
"Now it's safe"

1197
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:49,492
what is she talking about?

1198
01:27:50,551 --> 01:27:55,794
Does she really believe that Matsuda will act according to what she's written?

1199
01:28:00,366 --> 01:28:04,401
Are you for or against Kira's actions?

1200
01:28:05,261 --> 01:28:06,218
Don't you see?

1201
01:28:06,897 --> 01:28:09,532
If I supported Kira, I wouldn't appear on TV like this

1202
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,106
Don't you think it's dangerous?

1203
01:28:12,141 --> 01:28:13,445
It's a minute past the time....

1204
01:28:14,001 --> 01:28:15,088
Rem, what's going on?

1205
01:28:16,611 --> 01:28:17,122
"Rem.."

1206
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:20,028
What is "Rem"?

1207
01:28:20,444 --> 01:28:21,130
Who is she talking to?

1208
01:28:25,355 --> 01:28:26,606
A Death God?

1209
01:28:29,086 --> 01:28:32,641
"Matsuo Yosuke"
It must be a false name!

1210
01:28:33,542 --> 01:28:36,123
Rem! You must've known it since you're the Death God!

1211
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:38,082
You didn't tell me!

1212
01:28:38,824 --> 01:28:42,297
She often says "Death God"

1213
01:28:42,332 --> 01:28:43,822
Is it a code or something?

1214
01:28:45,089 --> 01:28:47,057
The most logical way is to think that

1215
01:28:48,485 --> 01:28:49,858
the Death God exists

1216
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:51,669
What?

1217
01:28:52,682 --> 01:28:52,962
Okay

1218
01:28:54,564 --> 01:28:55,353
Let's make a deal

1219
01:28:56,709 --> 01:28:57,709
Give me the Death God's eyes!

1220
01:29:02,692 --> 01:29:04,810
The Death God's eyes...?

1221
01:29:08,450 --> 01:29:10,017
The Second Kira said the same thing

1222
01:29:11,701 --> 01:29:13,682
The Second Kira has the ability to kill only by the faces

1223
01:29:15,470 --> 01:29:16,923
That's "the Death God's eye"

1224
01:30:31,361 --> 01:30:31,825
Roll down the window

1225
01:30:37,692 --> 01:30:38,585
Show me your ID

1226
01:30:40,882 --> 01:30:41,711
You don't have it?

1227
01:30:43,323 --> 01:30:46,026
Don't look at me like that, the rule is the rule

1228
01:30:47,678 --> 01:30:49,724
Shidohara Genta

1229
01:30:51,695 --> 01:30:52,651
How did you know my name?

1230
01:30:56,831 --> 01:30:57,599
Wait!

1231
01:30:58,635 --> 01:31:00,614
Do you appear on TV?

1232
01:31:02,322 --> 01:31:03,825
Something TV...

1233
01:31:04,837 --> 01:31:05,992
You're an anchor, right?

1234
01:31:07,365 --> 01:31:08,266
What are you doing?

1235
01:31:08,945 --> 01:31:09,868
Wait!

1236
01:31:44,029 --> 01:31:47,116
A policeman fell down, but I can't help him!

1237
01:31:47,843 --> 01:31:48,504
Got it

1238
01:31:49,845 --> 01:31:50,650
Did she use "the eye"?

1239
01:31:51,697 --> 01:31:53,524
It's too dangerous to let her go any further

1240
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:58,887
We don't know how she did it, but it's better to catch her

1241
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:52,500
Freeze!

1242
01:32:58,728 --> 01:33:00,030
Let me go!

1243
01:33:13,994 --> 01:33:14,711
Let me go!

1244
01:33:22,759 --> 01:33:26,248
We have watched every single action you made

1245
01:33:28,490 --> 01:33:30,655
The TV program was a fake

1246
01:33:32,326 --> 01:33:33,132
It was a trap!

1247
01:33:33,494 --> 01:33:34,399
Takada Kiyomi!

1248
01:33:36,428 --> 01:33:37,969
How did you do that?

1249
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,663
Are you a detective?

1250
01:33:40,970 --> 01:33:41,447
As Kira..

1251
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:44,033
How did you kill those people?

1252
01:33:46,474 --> 01:33:48,252
You wrote the names on the notebook

1253
01:33:53,481 --> 01:33:56,030
After writing them down.. what did you do?

1254
01:33:58,286 --> 01:33:59,115
I just write them down

1255
01:33:59,487 --> 01:34:01,020
I said what did you do after!

1256
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:04,774
Then why don't you try it?

1257
01:34:10,498 --> 01:34:12,500
You write names down and...

1258
01:34:13,003 --> 01:34:14,353
the person whose name is written dies

1259
01:34:15,176 --> 01:34:16,149
The notebook of the Death God

1260
01:34:29,904 --> 01:34:31,828
What the...

1261
01:34:33,488 --> 01:34:34,895
Dad, what's wrong?

1262
01:34:44,499 --> 01:34:47,310
When you touch it, you can see the Death God?

1263
01:34:55,263 --> 01:34:57,124
Ryuzaki, let me touch it!

1264
01:35:13,681 --> 01:35:15,772
Light... are you okay?

1265
01:35:17,498 --> 01:35:19,466
yeah

1266
01:35:24,381 --> 01:35:25,143
I won!

1267
01:35:26,062 --> 01:35:27,539
Everything's under control

1268
01:35:31,479 --> 01:35:35,753
If only I touch the Death Note, my memory will come back

1269
01:35:36,484 --> 01:35:37,443
Is this really true?

1270
01:35:38,213 --> 01:35:38,858
Yes, but

1271
01:35:39,393 --> 01:35:43,147
you can remember it only when you touch the Death Note

1272
01:35:43,182 --> 01:35:46,517
if the Note wasn't the one you used before

1273
01:35:46,705 --> 01:35:50,982
But if I keep the ownership, the memory won't be lost right?

1274
01:35:52,805 --> 01:35:54,384
How can I keep the ownership?

1275
01:35:54,469 --> 01:35:58,721
While you have the memory, kill the former owner

1276
01:35:59,371 --> 01:36:02,337
Good.
That explanation is enough

1277
01:36:03,064 --> 01:36:03,781
Rem

1278
01:36:04,313 --> 01:36:06,281
Give this to the Third Kira

1279
01:36:07,172 --> 01:36:09,515
If you're the Death God, you can find a suitable one

1280
01:36:10,233 --> 01:36:14,159
And after 13 days, let that person resume Kira's job

1281
01:36:14,813 --> 01:36:16,250
I can choose anyone?

1282
01:36:17,276 --> 01:36:21,928
As you won't remember, you can't reach the new owner

1283
01:36:22,741 --> 01:36:25,569
I know about my ability more than anyone else

1284
01:36:26,501 --> 01:36:29,491
I will definitely try hard to find the new Kira

1285
01:36:29,964 --> 01:36:30,983
and catch the person!

1286
01:36:32,142 --> 01:36:35,793
I'll touch the Note before L, or at the same time

1287
01:36:37,478 --> 01:36:38,472
And one more thing

1288
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,977
I have something I want you to write down on the Note

1289
01:36:42,483 --> 01:36:43,701
What is it?

1290
01:36:45,486 --> 01:36:46,515
I've made up

1291
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:50,094
a false rule of the Death Note

1292
01:37:03,241 --> 01:37:04,814
The Death God exists

1293
01:37:04,849 --> 01:37:06,219
That explains everything

1294
01:37:06,416 --> 01:37:09,108
Now I know how they kill

1295
01:37:10,062 --> 01:37:11,669
If you write down a person's name on the notebook

1296
01:37:12,481 --> 01:37:14,109
that person dies!

1297
01:37:15,271 --> 01:37:16,811
Is this correct. Takada Kiyomi?

1298
01:37:19,487 --> 01:37:22,465
The Death God...
The killer notebook...

1299
01:37:23,491 --> 01:37:26,392
Who will believe this?

1300
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:29,972
We can't judge her with the current laws!

1301
01:37:30,498 --> 01:37:31,560
That's right

1302
01:37:31,794 --> 01:37:33,513
I didn't kill anybody

1303
01:37:34,407 --> 01:37:36,042
I just wrote down the names

1304
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:37,401
No

1305
01:37:38,533 --> 01:37:40,876
If we can prove that the notebook kills people

1306
01:37:41,961 --> 01:37:43,102
You'll be guilty

1307
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:44,597
Death Penalty

1308
01:37:52,486 --> 01:37:54,488
Humans, listen!

1309
01:37:56,032 --> 01:37:58,453
I'm the Death God, Rem

1310
01:37:59,223 --> 01:38:02,132
Only the humans who touched the Death Note can see me

1311
01:38:02,573 --> 01:38:05,267
I can see your lifespan

1312
01:38:06,128 --> 01:38:08,971
And I can take your lives away

1313
01:38:10,471 --> 01:38:14,430
So you'd better not make me angry

1314
01:38:16,084 --> 01:38:19,470
The Death Note has the power of the Death God

1315
01:38:20,481 --> 01:38:22,476
That woman is correct

1316
01:38:22,483 --> 01:38:26,533
the humans whose name is written on the Death Note shall die

1317
01:38:27,163 --> 01:38:28,496
"Takada Kiyomi"

1318
01:38:28,701 --> 01:38:33,008
With so called Death Note you can control the dying situations, can't you?

1319
01:38:35,703 --> 01:38:37,733
Why don't you try it yourself

1320
01:38:38,501 --> 01:38:40,669
by writing her name on the Note?

1321
01:38:41,503 --> 01:38:43,113
Rem, what do you...

1322
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:03,513
Takada!

1323
01:39:12,026 --> 01:39:12,911
She's dead...

1324
01:39:17,321 --> 01:39:19,324
Light, hand me the notebook

1325
01:39:37,491 --> 01:39:38,818
Overall

1326
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,710
Why did Takada Kiyomi die?

1327
01:39:42,496 --> 01:39:44,915
Accidental heart attack or...

1328
01:39:45,382 --> 01:39:46,099
suicide...?

1329
01:39:47,753 --> 01:39:48,863
Killed by other Kira?

1330
01:39:50,471 --> 01:39:52,439
What do you think, Death God?

1331
01:39:53,087 --> 01:39:54,346
Don't ask me

1332
01:39:57,678 --> 01:40:01,207
The name on the notebook and the dead criminals are the same, but

1333
01:40:01,413 --> 01:40:03,376
there's no name before Light's confinement

1334
01:40:05,486 --> 01:40:06,657
What do you think?

1335
01:40:07,166 --> 01:40:11,390
The owner of the Note might die when the ownership moves to the other

1336
01:40:12,332 --> 01:40:14,343
The First and the Second Kira might have already...

1337
01:40:15,496 --> 01:40:17,142
I see. Now Takada has died

1338
01:40:17,992 --> 01:40:21,208
and the ownership of this notebook has transferred to someone else

1339
01:40:21,559 --> 01:40:22,826
What do you think, Death God?

1340
01:40:23,625 --> 01:40:24,573
Don't ask me

1341
01:40:25,723 --> 01:40:28,097
Who owns the Note now?

1342
01:40:28,957 --> 01:40:29,957
I cannot answer

1343
01:40:31,183 --> 01:40:33,562
Is that the only thing you can say?

1344
01:40:34,214 --> 01:40:35,065
By the way

1345
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:40,292
about the last rule of this Death Note

1346
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:46,887
"If the owner does not write any name for 13 days"

1347
01:40:47,587 --> 01:40:48,427
"the owner shall die"

1348
01:40:49,997 --> 01:40:53,956
Considering this rule, the former Kiras have died

1349
01:40:54,513 --> 01:40:56,978
Then Light, who was under surveillance for 18 days?

1350
01:40:57,167 --> 01:41:01,265
and Amane, which was 23 days, are completely innocent

1351
01:41:01,797 --> 01:41:02,876
Death God!

1352
01:41:04,965 --> 01:41:08,430
Are all the rules on this notebook true?

1353
01:41:10,946 --> 01:41:12,643
Yes, they are

1354
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:19,222
I got it, Light and Misa are free now

1355
01:41:21,026 --> 01:41:23,529
Light, call your mother and go home

1356
01:41:23,564 --> 01:41:24,047
Dad!

1357
01:41:24,501 --> 01:41:27,629
I'd like to stay here and continue working..

1358
01:41:28,536 --> 01:41:29,615
I think I have to

1359
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:31,896
Ryuzaki

1360
01:41:33,595 --> 01:41:34,851
You need me, don't you?

1361
01:41:36,544 --> 01:41:40,749
I got it.
Light, stay here and help us

1362
01:41:41,736 --> 01:41:43,959
This looks like a common notebook

1363
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:47,368
I can't believe this thing can kill people

1364
01:41:48,217 --> 01:41:48,903
What?

1365
01:41:49,251 --> 01:41:51,163
Why don't you come with me?

1366
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:52,783
You can come whenever you want

1367
01:41:53,365 --> 01:41:54,391
Ryuzaki will allow us

1368
01:41:55,083 --> 01:41:56,470
to just talk at the entrance

1369
01:41:57,849 --> 01:41:59,220
Right, I'll come see you everyday

1370
01:41:59,923 --> 01:42:00,663
Be prepared!

1371
01:42:07,528 --> 01:42:08,324
Misa...

1372
01:42:08,883 --> 01:42:09,966
Listen quietly

1373
01:42:13,347 --> 01:42:14,642
Will you do me a favor?

1374
01:42:17,272 --> 01:42:18,342
What is it?

1375
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:32,584
It's here!

1376
01:43:13,274 --> 01:43:14,961
Light is the Kira...

1377
01:43:17,229 --> 01:43:18,650
He's my God!

1378
01:43:22,027 --> 01:43:23,442
So happy

1379
01:43:24,769 --> 01:43:26,374
My Light is the Kira...!

1380
01:43:29,378 --> 01:43:32,300
I'm back at last!

1381
01:43:34,089 --> 01:43:34,927
Ryuk!

1382
01:43:36,712 --> 01:43:37,812
Why are you here?

1383
01:43:38,714 --> 01:43:40,969
That Death Note is mine

1384
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:43,956
So this time I'll follow you

1385
01:43:45,263 --> 01:43:48,101
Don't worry, your memory won't be gone

1386
01:43:48,384 --> 01:43:51,758
If you become the owner of this Note

1387
01:43:54,272 --> 01:43:55,710
Okay, I'll be the owner

1388
01:43:57,275 --> 01:43:58,543
Oh, I almost forgot!

1389
01:44:03,281 --> 01:44:04,008
Here

1390
01:44:04,365 --> 01:44:05,365
A gift from Light!

1391
01:44:07,285 --> 01:44:08,634
App.. Apple

1392
01:44:08,978 --> 01:44:11,045
Oh Light... !
He's more generous than he looks!

1393
01:44:14,588 --> 01:44:15,169
"Dear Misa"

1394
01:44:16,261 --> 01:44:21,165
"When you read this letter, you must've remembered everything."

1395
01:44:22,267 --> 01:44:24,779
"To create an ideal world together."

1396
01:44:25,418 --> 01:44:27,949
"You must resume punishing instead of me."

1397
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:30,442
"And one more thing."

1398
01:44:31,242 --> 01:44:35,674
"do you remember the guy named Ryuzaki I introduced you at my college?"

1399
01:44:36,787 --> 01:44:39,716
"He's our enemy, L"

1400
01:44:41,286 --> 01:44:42,201
That guy is L?

1401
01:44:43,181 --> 01:44:47,117
"You must've seen his real name with your Death God's eye."

1402
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:50,531
"Write down the name on the Death Note"

1403
01:44:50,902 --> 01:44:52,249
"and eliminate L."

1404
01:44:56,954 --> 01:44:58,352
Elminate L...

1405
01:45:12,283 --> 01:45:12,958
Damn it!

1406
01:45:14,286 --> 01:45:16,144
I can't remember it!

1407
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:22,046
I saw names of hundreds of people everyday

1408
01:45:23,551 --> 01:45:27,510
Once you discard the ownership, you lose the ability of "the eye"

1409
01:45:28,266 --> 01:45:30,352
I'm sorry, Misa

1410
01:45:33,771 --> 01:45:35,136
Ryuk

1411
01:45:37,491 --> 01:45:38,984
Make the eye-deal again

1412
01:45:39,557 --> 01:45:40,493
Are you sure?

1413
01:45:41,866 --> 01:45:43,979
You've already lost half of your lifespan

1414
01:45:44,653 --> 01:45:46,317
You'll lose the half of if

1415
01:45:46,784 --> 01:45:48,909
I know!

1416
01:45:50,258 --> 01:45:53,142
I don't want to lose my face!

1417
01:45:53,758 --> 01:45:54,298
Face....

1418
01:45:55,751 --> 01:45:57,153
but you have the face.

1419
01:45:57,912 --> 01:45:59,349
Don't take it literally!

1420
01:46:01,437 --> 01:46:03,943
Well, I don't understand human mind really...

1421
01:46:04,389 --> 01:46:06,304
You want the Death God's eye

1422
01:46:10,775 --> 01:46:12,855
I have to obey Light...

1423
01:46:23,637 --> 01:46:25,480
Just one week after Takada's death...

1424
01:46:27,694 --> 01:46:29,297
The new Kira has appeared!

1425
01:46:30,591 --> 01:46:31,828
Criminals are being killed again

1426
01:46:32,547 --> 01:46:35,443
It means there are more notebooks

1427
01:46:36,768 --> 01:46:37,692
Just after,

1428
01:46:39,107 --> 01:46:40,559
Amane Misa was freed

1429
01:46:41,741 --> 01:46:42,331
Ryuzaki!

1430
01:46:43,289 --> 01:46:44,159
Don't give me that again!

1431
01:46:44,404 --> 01:46:46,815
Don't you remember the 13 day rule?

1432
01:46:47,405 --> 01:46:48,043
Mr Yagami

1433
01:46:49,335 --> 01:46:50,134
What?

1434
01:46:50,169 --> 01:46:53,731
Let's inspect this notebook

1435
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:59,330
I'll ask FBI and have them provide us with two prisoners from the death row

1436
01:46:59,791 --> 01:47:02,133
We'll make the prisoners A write the name of the B

1437
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:03,583
to see if B will die

1438
01:47:05,654 --> 01:47:09,613
then leave A from the Note for 13 days to see if A will die

1439
01:47:10,768 --> 01:47:14,684
I can't believe you treat human lives like bugs

1440
01:47:15,773 --> 01:47:17,441
It can't be helped

1441
01:47:18,309 --> 01:47:20,571
It's to protect thousands of people's lives

1442
01:47:20,778 --> 01:47:21,999
Isn't there any other way?

1443
01:47:42,751 --> 01:47:43,557
Today, again!

1444
01:47:43,896 --> 01:47:45,921
A numerous number of criminals are killed

1445
01:47:51,776 --> 01:47:52,436
Ryuzaki

1446
01:47:53,385 --> 01:47:55,544
You may be right to stop Kira from killing people

1447
01:47:56,928 --> 01:47:59,587
I'll take responsibility for the experiment

1448
01:47:59,784 --> 01:48:01,215
I'll supervise

1449
01:48:02,524 --> 01:48:03,080
Dad..

1450
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:06,074
Thank you for understanding

1451
01:48:06,791 --> 01:48:08,612
I'll goto the States

1452
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,127
Are you going alone?

1453
01:48:11,166 --> 01:48:12,531
Let me go with you

1454
01:48:12,764 --> 01:48:13,798
No, you can't

1455
01:48:14,766 --> 01:48:17,206
Stay here with Ryuzaki and wait until I contact you

1456
01:48:18,698 --> 01:48:19,910
I'll be fine

1457
01:48:20,478 --> 01:48:22,663
Others will come with me, little to worry

1458
01:48:23,229 --> 01:48:24,844
Wait, am I worrying?

1459
01:48:27,251 --> 01:48:27,937
How about here?

1460
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:29,356
Yes, it is worrying

1461
01:48:34,786 --> 01:48:38,742
First, goto the Tokyo Bay heliport by car

1462
01:48:40,579 --> 01:48:45,903
Then fly to the Yokota Camp. The US army will carry you by plane to Washington D.C.

1463
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:49,000
Watari has arranged for everything

1464
01:48:49,519 --> 01:48:50,123
I got it

1465
01:48:50,768 --> 01:48:52,096
See you later

1466
01:49:20,765 --> 01:49:22,600
Now, we're all alone

1467
01:49:23,768 --> 01:49:25,624
What are you thinking about?

1468
01:49:26,771 --> 01:49:27,987
Right now

1469
01:49:28,514 --> 01:49:30,606
Watari is coming here Amane

1470
01:49:32,035 --> 01:49:33,663
It was your plan!

1471
01:49:35,019 --> 01:49:35,889
Why Misa?

1472
01:49:36,781 --> 01:49:41,498
For some reason, the 13 day rule didn't work for Amane

1473
01:49:42,702 --> 01:49:44,872
Amane is the Second Kira

1474
01:49:45,642 --> 01:49:47,930
And she has another Death Note

1475
01:49:48,362 --> 01:49:50,151
This is what I'm thinking about

1476
01:49:51,092 --> 01:49:56,684
Then why she didn't write your name when she was freed?

1477
01:49:57,196 --> 01:50:01,289
Probably, she forgot my name she saw at the college

1478
01:50:01,858 --> 01:50:03,979
while she was restrained

1479
01:50:05,729 --> 01:50:07,924
Forgetting things is a girl's nature

1480
01:50:11,477 --> 01:50:12,911
I am going to

1481
01:50:12,946 --> 01:50:15,163
show my face to Amane

1482
01:50:17,627 --> 01:50:18,703
What?

1483
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:20,817
If you do that, she'll...

1484
01:50:21,318 --> 01:50:23,163
Yes, she'll definitely write my name..

1485
01:50:23,198 --> 01:50:25,738
We can catch her when she's done it

1486
01:50:26,256 --> 01:50:29,687
Let's get her Note

1487
01:50:30,721 --> 01:50:32,763
We never know when and when she'll write

1488
01:50:33,167 --> 01:50:36,688
There are millions of cameras in this building

1489
01:50:36,727 --> 01:50:38,778
What if she didn't bring the Note?

1490
01:50:38,813 --> 01:50:40,588
She'll definitely bring it. This is a huge chance

1491
01:50:41,392 --> 01:50:42,762
to kill me

1492
01:50:46,737 --> 01:50:47,553
All right!

1493
01:50:48,381 --> 01:50:50,537
Then we'll catch her, and restrain her again

1494
01:50:50,572 --> 01:50:52,379
until she tells us about the First Kira

1495
01:50:52,882 --> 01:50:53,944
Is that alright?

1496
01:50:54,712 --> 01:50:56,818
We can definitely make her confess

1497
01:50:57,352 --> 01:50:58,352
as we have the evidence

1498
01:50:59,157 --> 01:51:01,966
You shut out the crew to do this, didn't you?

1499
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,597
If she'll be tied like that again

1500
01:51:05,286 --> 01:51:07,391
She may die this time

1501
01:51:08,546 --> 01:51:10,514
I know I feel sorry, but it can't be helped

1502
01:51:20,968 --> 01:51:22,677
What's the matter Death God?

1503
01:51:35,413 --> 01:51:37,667
Ryuzaki asked me to come

1504
01:51:38,425 --> 01:51:41,651
does it mean he doesn't suspect me as Kira anymore?

1505
01:51:42,298 --> 01:51:43,376
Of course, he doesn't

1506
01:51:57,741 --> 01:51:58,690
But if...

1507
01:51:59,764 --> 01:52:02,078
I couldn't save your life...

1508
01:52:02,713 --> 01:52:05,145
If my heart stops

1509
01:52:05,716 --> 01:52:07,830
this sensor will automatically alert Mr. Yagami

1510
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:11,266
I've asked him to burn the Death Note

1511
01:52:11,687 --> 01:52:13,979
to never be used again

1512
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:21,771
Misa's lifespan has been shortened again

1513
01:52:23,982 --> 01:52:24,822
Lifespan?

1514
01:52:25,538 --> 01:52:26,166
What do you mean?

1515
01:52:26,622 --> 01:52:27,195
Ryuzaki

1516
01:52:28,739 --> 01:52:31,054
If you risk your life I'm prepared too

1517
01:52:32,218 --> 01:52:33,728
Let's catch Amane Misa

1518
01:52:33,763 --> 01:52:36,289
...the Second Kira in the act!

1519
01:52:42,427 --> 01:52:43,099
Here she comes

1520
01:53:05,743 --> 01:53:07,697
Yagami Light....

1521
01:53:08,425 --> 01:53:11,078
You've known that this would happen

1522
01:53:12,134 --> 01:53:16,444
Since when I told you that if a Death God expands lifespan of a human

1523
01:53:17,007 --> 01:53:17,838
the Death God will die

1524
01:53:21,195 --> 01:53:23,209
You drove her intoa a corner

1525
01:53:23,244 --> 01:53:24,860
to make me save her

1526
01:53:25,664 --> 01:53:27,815
It will expand her lifespan

1527
01:53:28,499 --> 01:53:29,499
and I will die instead

1528
01:53:31,013 --> 01:53:34,564
That's been your plan from that day

1529
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:38,180
You'll succeed in killing a Death God!

1530
01:53:39,099 --> 01:53:41,668
You are the true devil

1531
01:53:43,552 --> 01:53:46,597
But still, Misa loves you

1532
01:53:48,523 --> 01:53:49,703
Yagami Light!

1533
01:53:50,517 --> 01:53:53,587
I'll never let you use my Note!

1534
01:53:55,008 --> 01:53:55,780
Misa...

1535
01:53:57,038 --> 01:53:58,398
Even if a short while...

1536
01:53:58,433 --> 01:53:59,766
be happy...

1537
01:54:16,257 --> 01:54:17,101
Watari...!

1538
01:54:17,707 --> 01:54:18,703
Checkmate..!

1539
01:54:43,690 --> 01:54:44,691
Did you use...

1540
01:54:44,726 --> 01:54:45,663
that Death God...?

1541
01:54:48,386 --> 01:54:50,802
Rem has a gentle heart

1542
01:54:52,996 --> 01:54:54,298
Yagami Light...

1543
01:54:57,721 --> 01:54:58,448
I knew it...

1544
01:54:58,645 --> 01:54:59,849
You are the Kira

1545
01:55:00,064 --> 01:55:01,796
I wanted to know your name

1546
01:55:04,315 --> 01:55:05,072
Loser

1547
01:55:07,315 --> 01:55:08,665
I am

1548
01:55:10,699 --> 01:55:11,917
not a...

1549
01:55:20,813 --> 01:55:22,781
Goodbye, L

1550
01:55:24,404 --> 01:55:27,303
You were the best rival

1551
01:55:27,789 --> 01:55:29,256
of me, Kira, the God of the new world.

1552
01:55:30,675 --> 01:55:32,106
If I made a single mistake

1553
01:55:32,959 --> 01:55:34,949
I might've been dead too

1554
01:55:36,625 --> 01:55:38,853
It was a high risk to release Misa

1555
01:55:40,095 --> 01:55:44,891
and let her use Death Note instead of me

1556
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:50,796
Keep watching me achieving the revolution

1557
01:55:52,433 --> 01:55:55,232
Farewell, L.

1558
01:55:57,747 --> 01:55:58,468
I see...

1559
01:55:58,469 --> 01:56:03,662
She burnt the Note with her

1560
01:56:08,568 --> 01:56:09,526
Light!

1561
01:56:09,561 --> 01:56:10,405
You made it!

1562
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:11,290
Misa, where's the Note?

1563
01:56:17,631 --> 01:56:19,800
So, you killed L!

1564
01:56:19,801 --> 01:56:21,675
Ryuk! How have you been?

1565
01:56:22,257 --> 01:56:23,860
I won, L is dead

1566
01:56:24,443 --> 01:56:25,688
But I still have a job

1567
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:33,792
"Yagami Soichiro"

1568
01:56:37,344 --> 01:56:38,765
"Heart attack"

1569
01:56:40,180 --> 01:56:41,867
That's your own father's name, Light!

1570
01:56:42,585 --> 01:56:44,013
To create the new world

1571
01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:46,401
But

1572
01:56:49,716 --> 01:56:51,080
He's your father!

1573
01:56:51,926 --> 01:56:52,834
Why!

1574
01:56:52,835 --> 01:56:54,728
Just shut up!

1575
01:56:55,846 --> 01:56:57,301
No matter how you love something,

1576
01:56:58,269 --> 01:56:59,867
there's the time you have make sacrifices

1577
01:57:01,958 --> 01:57:03,602
I cannot be what I used to be

1578
01:57:09,092 --> 01:57:14,302
"Comes back with the Death Note, gives it to Light and dies"

1579
01:57:46,001 --> 01:57:46,716
Dad...

1580
01:57:56,489 --> 01:57:58,294
Give the Death Note back to me

1581
01:58:02,353 --> 01:58:03,082
Dad

1582
01:58:05,402 --> 01:58:07,453
Since we were young

1583
01:58:08,142 --> 01:58:09,708
You don't forgive even the most insignificant injustice

1584
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:12,314
and try to be our model father

1585
01:58:13,723 --> 01:58:15,736
I respect you so much

1586
01:58:17,477 --> 01:58:19,299
So I'm sure you'll understand

1587
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:22,247
What I'm going to do

1588
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:25,384
What I will achieve

1589
01:58:29,682 --> 01:58:30,291
Dad...

1590
01:58:33,686 --> 01:58:36,705
I'm sorry

1591
01:58:37,630 --> 01:58:38,619
It's your time

1592
01:58:51,195 --> 01:58:52,329
Where's the Death Note?

1593
01:58:52,611 --> 01:58:53,140
Light

1594
01:58:55,286 --> 01:58:56,538
I saw everything

1595
01:59:01,057 --> 01:59:02,360
I watched you through the cameras

1596
01:59:04,237 --> 01:59:05,420
and I heard your voice

1597
01:59:06,418 --> 01:59:07,175
What?

1598
01:59:17,563 --> 01:59:18,546
Light!

1599
01:59:20,155 --> 01:59:21,223
Light!

1600
01:59:22,886 --> 01:59:23,778
You're...

1601
01:59:24,996 --> 01:59:25,844
under arrest

1602
01:59:29,675 --> 01:59:31,276
Light,

1603
01:59:33,264 --> 01:59:34,294
I'm so sad

1604
01:59:35,181 --> 01:59:35,923
we couldn't be friends

1605
01:59:39,685 --> 01:59:40,840
Ryuzaki...?

1606
01:59:43,726 --> 01:59:44,682
You...

1607
01:59:46,376 --> 01:59:47,124
Why...

1608
01:59:53,982 --> 01:59:55,344
A fake notebook!

1609
01:59:57,231 --> 01:59:58,258
Misa, you betrayed me!

1610
02:00:00,001 --> 02:00:00,981
No, I didn't

1611
02:00:02,696 --> 02:00:04,647
How can I betray you?

1612
02:00:05,678 --> 02:00:09,248
No matter how evil you are

1613
02:00:10,775 --> 02:00:12,076
I love you!

1614
02:00:15,322 --> 02:00:17,760
She didn't betray you

1615
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:22,409
It was unexpected that the Death God acted that way

1616
02:00:25,514 --> 02:00:26,984
This is the real one

1617
02:00:27,516 --> 02:00:29,909
Amane Misa digged out

1618
02:00:32,507 --> 02:00:33,460
And this

1619
02:00:34,456 --> 02:00:37,470
is my real name, which you wanted to know

1620
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:44,975
You can't change what is written in the Death Note

1621
02:00:45,534 --> 02:00:48,827
which means you won't die until the day written first

1622
02:00:49,538 --> 02:00:52,748
I'll die 20 days later

1623
02:00:53,938 --> 02:00:55,993
so you can't kill me now

1624
02:00:57,513 --> 02:00:58,732
when did you switch them?

1625
02:00:59,515 --> 02:01:02,232
The criminals I punished died as planned

1626
02:01:03,519 --> 02:01:05,010
Yes, on the first day

1627
02:01:05,977 --> 02:01:09,603
Then I concluded that you are the Second Kira

1628
02:01:10,526 --> 02:01:13,007
The 13 day rule is also false

1629
02:01:13,529 --> 02:01:16,360
From the second day, Watari switched it into the fake one

1630
02:01:17,082 --> 02:01:19,175
We were watching it

1631
02:01:20,036 --> 02:01:22,318
and told you a false information

1632
02:01:23,249 --> 02:01:26,807
as if the criminals were killed by Kira

1633
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:29,507
The biggest goal was, Light

1634
02:01:29,783 --> 02:01:32,935
to confirm that you're Kira

1635
02:01:33,765 --> 02:01:35,298
You're a smart boy

1636
02:01:35,889 --> 02:01:37,438
You didn't give me any clue

1637
02:01:37,996 --> 02:01:39,020
So I decided

1638
02:01:41,009 --> 02:01:42,967
to give up my own life

1639
02:01:43,773 --> 02:01:47,227
This plan couldn't succeed without Mr. Yagami's cooperation

1640
02:01:48,462 --> 02:01:51,160
He is a very sincere person. At first he refused to do it

1641
02:01:51,972 --> 02:01:54,298
But when I showed him my name written in the Note

1642
02:01:54,753 --> 02:01:57,072
I think he understood that I was serious

1643
02:01:57,849 --> 02:01:59,479
Then he finally said yes

1644
02:02:00,410 --> 02:02:02,302
to cooperate with my plan

1645
02:02:04,470 --> 02:02:05,053
He said

1646
02:02:06,453 --> 02:02:07,453
you're not Kira

1647
02:02:08,697 --> 02:02:10,596
he would believe so

1648
02:02:11,039 --> 02:02:12,341
until the last moment

1649
02:02:13,782 --> 02:02:15,677
The cars didn't go to the heliport

1650
02:02:15,712 --> 02:02:17,960
and everyone was watching

1651
02:02:18,591 --> 02:02:20,377
what was happening here

1652
02:02:34,933 --> 02:02:35,972
The saddest thing is

1653
02:02:36,966 --> 02:02:38,609
Watari's death

1654
02:02:39,486 --> 02:02:42,668
I couldn't predict that the Death God would write his name

1655
02:02:44,309 --> 02:02:46,195
That was my last mistake

1656
02:02:47,147 --> 02:02:48,073
Light

1657
02:02:48,743 --> 02:02:50,254
I will understand

1658
02:02:51,232 --> 02:02:53,211
what you are going to do

1659
02:02:53,564 --> 02:02:54,509
you said so

1660
02:02:56,087 --> 02:02:56,695
I'm sorry

1661
02:02:57,525 --> 02:02:58,892
I cannot understand at all

1662
02:02:58,893 --> 02:03:00,573
This isn't justice at all

1663
02:03:05,357 --> 02:03:07,213
Before I got the Death Note

1664
02:03:09,128 --> 02:03:12,516
the world was dead, with tons of criminals that current laws can't punish!

1665
02:03:14,863 --> 02:03:16,245
It was so unreasonable!

1666
02:03:18,112 --> 02:03:19,083
You know what happened

1667
02:03:19,921 --> 02:03:23,029
After Kira appeared, the crime rate decreased 70%

1668
02:03:24,543 --> 02:03:26,667
Isn't that what you want?

1669
02:03:28,112 --> 02:03:29,918
to live in such a peaceful world?

1670
02:03:42,873 --> 02:03:44,515
Light!

1671
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:52,058
A sheet of the Death Note

1672
02:03:52,093 --> 02:03:53,461
I knew you have it

1673
02:03:54,754 --> 02:03:56,191
You killed Takada with that

1674
02:03:58,109 --> 02:03:59,381
At last,

1675
02:04:00,067 --> 02:04:01,009
I found the last piece

1676
02:04:24,105 --> 02:04:26,105
You're right, I'm the Kira

1677
02:04:27,687 --> 02:04:29,733
I'm God of the new world

1678
02:04:30,834 --> 02:04:31,918
No, you're not

1679
02:04:32,647 --> 02:04:34,466
You are just a murderer

1680
02:04:35,703 --> 02:04:37,101
And this notebook is

1681
02:04:38,049 --> 02:04:40,294
The most horrible lethal weapon ever

1682
02:04:41,387 --> 02:04:42,074
L...

1683
02:04:43,703 --> 02:04:46,570
You don't know, since you don't go out of your cozy room

1684
02:04:47,792 --> 02:04:51,748
You don't know that good people are suffering because of evil people in the world!

1685
02:04:52,457 --> 02:04:54,357
There are tons of evil human beings

1686
02:04:54,891 --> 02:04:56,948
who should disappear for the rest of the people!

1687
02:04:57,306 --> 02:05:00,232
It's impossible to save them with the power of the laws

1688
02:05:02,317 --> 02:05:03,497
Yes, it's impossible

1689
02:05:04,016 --> 02:05:05,100
Laws aren't perfect

1690
02:05:06,544 --> 02:05:08,613
because humans, who created laws that aren't perfect

1691
02:05:09,307 --> 02:05:10,384
It's impossible to be perfect

1692
02:05:12,347 --> 02:05:13,448
However,

1693
02:05:13,483 --> 02:05:17,397
the lawas are evidence of human's struggle to be righteous

1694
02:05:19,673 --> 02:05:21,014
You are egotistical

1695
02:05:22,453 --> 02:05:26,441
It must never be allowed to rob someone's life based on ego!

1696
02:05:31,027 --> 02:05:33,104
It's wasteful to talk with you!

1697
02:05:36,270 --> 02:05:37,061
Ryuk!

1698
02:05:39,621 --> 02:05:41,489
Ryuk, where are you

1699
02:05:43,288 --> 02:05:44,424
Hi there

1700
02:05:46,919 --> 02:05:48,243
Oh, another Death God

1701
02:05:49,664 --> 02:05:51,599
Can everyone see it, as you all have touched the Note?

1702
02:05:56,367 --> 02:05:57,157
Ryuk...

1703
02:06:00,289 --> 02:06:02,295
I'll show you something fun

1704
02:06:04,329 --> 02:06:05,684
Kill them all

1705
02:06:07,711 --> 02:06:09,444
Kill them all right now!

1706
02:06:12,153 --> 02:06:13,031
Light!

1707
02:06:13,891 --> 02:06:17,850
What are you waiting for?
Write their names, hurry

1708
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:22,448
All right, I'll write it down

1709
02:06:23,901 --> 02:06:24,902
Don't!

1710
02:06:24,937 --> 02:06:26,445
Stop!

1711
02:06:44,565 --> 02:06:45,785
It's no use...

1712
02:06:47,614 --> 02:06:48,541
Ryuk...

1713
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:50,312
Are you done yet?

1714
02:06:50,717 --> 02:06:51,739
yep

1715
02:06:53,851 --> 02:06:54,641
Show me

1716
02:06:55,899 --> 02:06:57,538
See

1717
02:06:59,747 --> 02:07:00,747
"Yagami Light"

1718
02:07:08,878 --> 02:07:09,996
Too bad!

1719
02:07:10,657 --> 02:07:12,303
You've been too much

1720
02:07:12,886 --> 02:07:14,404
dependent on me

1721
02:07:15,146 --> 02:07:16,168
Wait...

1722
02:07:16,475 --> 02:07:18,731
I said...
I'd show you something fun!

1723
02:07:21,892 --> 02:07:24,793
You've shown me enough

1724
02:07:25,884 --> 02:07:27,009
You've enjoyed enough too

1725
02:07:27,898 --> 02:07:29,411
What are you talking about!

1726
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:31,511
Nothing has started yet!

1727
02:07:32,373 --> 02:07:33,997
Oh, I almost forgot to say

1728
02:07:34,952 --> 02:07:36,648
A human who used the Death Note

1729
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:40,307
cannot goto heaven nor hell

1730
02:07:41,242 --> 02:07:43,346
After you die, you'll see

1731
02:07:45,713 --> 02:07:46,713
nought!

1732
02:07:56,894 --> 02:07:58,584
Light!

1733
02:07:59,897 --> 02:08:01,812
Why, Ryuk, why?

1734
02:08:02,495 --> 02:08:04,179
I can't die here!

1735
02:08:04,692 --> 02:08:06,310
Light!

1736
02:08:09,168 --> 02:08:10,237
Why?

1737
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:14,417
I was always trying to do the right thing

1738
02:08:15,256 --> 02:08:18,197
You tought me what justice is, Dad

1739
02:08:18,232 --> 02:08:21,842
Why do I have to die like this!

1740
02:08:36,293 --> 02:08:38,532
Kira is, the justice...

1741
02:08:41,281 --> 02:08:42,052
Dad..

1742
02:08:43,921 --> 02:08:46,309
Please understand me...

1743
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:52,733
Light?

1744
02:09:03,832 --> 02:09:04,896
You idiot..

1745
02:09:39,722 --> 02:09:41,700
I will clean out

1746
02:09:42,605 --> 02:09:44,573
every Death Note

1747
02:09:45,344 --> 02:09:47,195
You don't want to use it?

1748
02:09:48,471 --> 02:09:50,804
Oh, I'm soooo bored!

1749
02:10:21,079 --> 02:10:22,564
I reported the eveen to the superiors

1750
02:10:24,261 --> 02:10:26,580
I couldn't say anything about the Death Note though

1751
02:10:27,033 --> 02:10:29,252
I reported everything to ICPO

1752
02:10:29,952 --> 02:10:31,925
They couldn't understand

1753
02:10:33,033 --> 02:10:36,035
Kira's death won't be announced

1754
02:10:38,441 --> 02:10:40,647
Light was killed by Kira...

1755
02:10:41,134 --> 02:10:43,010
It's the truth

1756
02:10:43,527 --> 02:10:46,433
I told Sachiko and Sayu

1757
02:10:48,329 --> 02:10:50,718
Amane has lost her memory about the Death Note again

1758
02:10:52,121 --> 02:10:55,070
Because we burned both notebooks

1759
02:10:56,296 --> 02:10:57,568
Ryuzaki

1760
02:10:59,904 --> 02:11:01,815
I can't say a word for you

1761
02:11:03,239 --> 02:11:04,108
I'm sorry

1762
02:11:05,647 --> 02:11:06,647
It's me

1763
02:11:08,089 --> 02:11:09,925
who has to apologize

1764
02:11:11,224 --> 02:11:13,110
I couldn't even save Light

1765
02:11:14,659 --> 02:11:15,304
Ryuzaki,

1766
02:11:16,795 --> 02:11:18,473
I'm happy to fight along with you

1767
02:11:19,111 --> 02:11:20,166
I"m proud of you

1768
02:11:22,392 --> 02:11:25,317
It's my time, let me be alone

1769
02:11:28,147 --> 02:11:29,318
I don't know

1770
02:11:31,283 --> 02:11:33,033
What kind of people my parents are

1771
02:11:34,741 --> 02:11:35,882
But I know, Mr. Yagami

1772
02:11:36,603 --> 02:11:38,249
You are a great father

1773
02:11:38,472 --> 02:11:39,247
also to me

1774
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:42,425
Ryuzaki...

1775
02:11:45,987 --> 02:11:47,734
Goodbye, Mr. Yagami

1776
02:11:49,258 --> 02:11:50,462
And thank you

1777
02:12:31,389 --> 02:12:33,357
One year later

1778
02:12:45,129 --> 02:12:47,990
It's the first time we baked a birthday cake for Light

1779
02:12:48,479 --> 02:12:50,125
after he graduated kindergarten

1780
02:12:52,063 --> 02:12:54,862
After he entered elementary school, I started buying it every year

1781
02:12:55,379 --> 02:12:57,328
I remembe that I blew out the candles

1782
02:12:57,381 --> 02:12:58,965
I asked him right?

1783
02:12:59,509 --> 02:13:02,299
Your brother let you do it

1784
02:13:03,256 --> 02:13:04,766
even though it was his birthday

1785
02:13:05,365 --> 02:13:07,112
He was so kind to you

1786
02:13:12,363 --> 02:13:14,284
Mom, look!
It's snowing

1787
02:13:15,976 --> 02:13:16,977
Sayu, bring an umbrella to the station for Dad

1788
02:13:37,220 --> 02:13:38,269
Dad!

1789
02:13:38,859 --> 02:13:40,564
Oh, thanks

1790
02:13:45,211 --> 02:13:46,784
Shall we share it?

1791
02:13:49,621 --> 02:13:53,257
After Kira disappeared, is the crime rate increasing?

1792
02:13:54,372 --> 02:13:57,060
Do you think the world still needs Kira?

1793
02:13:57,375 --> 02:13:58,649
No, I don't

1794
02:13:59,046 --> 02:14:00,401
Kira... killed my...

1795
02:14:08,386 --> 02:14:12,019
Light fought against Kira, until the very last moment

1796
02:14:13,032 --> 02:14:14,239
I know...

1797
02:14:15,448 --> 02:14:16,822
I know, Dad

1798
02:14:29,078 --> 02:14:30,801
Happy birthday

1799
02:14:33,377 --> 02:14:35,496
I feel like I...

1800
02:14:36,296 --> 02:14:38,316
forgot something very important

1801
02:14:41,184 --> 02:14:41,966
But...

1802
02:14:43,777 --> 02:14:46,386
I can't remember anything!

1803
02:14:54,365 --> 02:14:56,146
Light....

1804
02:14:57,305 --> 02:15:57,519
