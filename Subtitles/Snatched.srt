00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,706
What does this say?

3
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,642
Does it say, "i grabbed it
outta my suitcase

4
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,177
"and went to the beach"

5
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,479
or "girl who overplans
for vacation outfits"?

6
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:21,680
There's just a picture
of a bird on it.

7
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,715
It doesn't
say anything.

8
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:26,151
No, I mean, like,
its vibe, you know?

9
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,853
Like, what's its vibe?
Oh.

10
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,688
It's perfect for Ecuador.

11
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,157
Yeah. And, like,
why Ecuador?

12
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,793
Because we didn't
want to go
somewhere touristy.

13
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,529
We're not just, like,
a couple of white assholes.

14
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,098
No offense.

15
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,299
I really need it.

16
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:43,168
I just want to, like,
sip a mai tai

17
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,472
and smoke a j,
and then just
kinda, like

18
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,507
start having red wine
at night.

19
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,808
And then scotch.

20
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,310
And if somebody's like,

21
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:52,644
"have you ever done
ayahuasca?"

22
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,647
I'll be like,
"no, is it safe?"

23
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,583
And then I'll try it.
I don't care.

24
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:00,285
And are things ideal,
financially, right now?

25
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,688
No. The answer is no.

26
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,857
But will
things pick up?

27
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,725
One thousand percent.

28
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,294
Did I tell you
Michael's band is
blowing up right now?

29
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,429
Yeah.

30
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:14,433
you know, money won't be
an "ish" much longer.

31
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,235
This is a good color
for me, right?

32
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:18,237
So, did you guys have this
in my size?

33
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,240
Yeah, no.

34
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,674
Sorry.

35
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:23,909
Okay.
Thanks, anyway.

36
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,310
Have fun on your trip.

37
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,478
Nice meeting you.

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,746
I hope you
find your keys.

39
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,481
Oh, my keys. Fuck!

40
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,350
This would be
cute on me if...

41
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,888
Are you serious?

42
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,424
You are supposed to be
selling clothes
to the customers.

43
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,528
And what are you even doing
on the floor?

44
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,264
I'm re-racking
clothes

45
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,732
you know what?
You're fired!
What?

46
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:50,669
I need this job.
Can you just
think about this?

47
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:55,174
Like, what about this bitch?
I've never seen her do shit.

48
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,341
You don't do shit here!

49
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,476
She doesn't work here.

50
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:58,610
Oh, okay.

51
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,846
Hi. Thank you so much
for coming in.

52
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,314
Look, can we just
talk about this

53
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,183
when I get back from
my vacation to Ecuador?

54
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,417
Vacation?

55
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,320
You never even asked
for time off.

56
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,322
And I'm realizing that
right now, okay?

57
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,723
And it's because
i forgot.

58
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,327
God! You know what?
I don't need this job.

59
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,629
I'm gonna go have
a sick time in Ecuador.

60
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:22,267
with all your shirts
and your hours.

61
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,468
Because I don't need it.

62
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,836
I'm about to
kick your ass.

63
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,238
Takin' this.

64
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,806
Put the damn hat down!

65
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,708
I looked her
right in the eye,
and I went

66
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,644
"i wouldn't work here
if you paid me."

67
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,880
And I just stormed out.
Just like, for real.

68
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,915
Like, "bye."
Another one will come.

69
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,885
You know what? I'm not gonna
talk about that anymore.

70
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,420
I wanna focus
on you and me

71
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,956
on the beach.
Are you with me?

72
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,658
I can't go
to south America.

73
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,627
What are you talking about?

74
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,495
I can't go
to Ecuador.

75
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,664
You know it's
a non-refundable trip,
right?

76
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,399
I don't want to make it
about money

77
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:58,237
but I don't have any more
coming right now, so

78
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,871
I'm breaking up
with you.

79
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,509
When?

80
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,981
Like, right now. This is it.
You're in the middle of it.

81
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,649
Is it because
you're afraid

82
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,484
because things are going
so great between us?

83
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,319
That's what this is!
No.

84
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,787
You're terrified, because
you've never felt this way

85
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:16,855
about somebody before.

86
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:17,990
I know what's happening.

87
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,658
I'll tell you what it is.
Okay.

88
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,394
The band is
really blowing up
right now, you know?

89
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:26,498
And I'm going like this.
I'm taking off, all right?

90
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,799
Okay.
And this is you.

91
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,936
Just on the ground.

92
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,838
I'm up here, too.
No, you're not up there.

93
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,573
Why can't I go up there?
No, stop.

94
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,476
I'm going this way.
I'm with you.

95
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:38,944
Well, I'm going
that way now.

96
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,345
Now, I'm over there.

97
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,780
I'm going.
You can't reach.

98
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,015
My hand's over there.

99
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,549
Look.
This is the thing.

100
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:47,819
Where I'm going,
there's gonna be
a ton of...

101
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,022
Inspiration.
...Pussy.

102
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,590
Inspiration?
No, pussy.

103
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:52,724
I keep talking
over you,

104
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,393
but it's sounding like
you're saying...

105
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,427
Pussy.

106
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,461
I heard it that time.

107
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,596
You heard it?

108
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:00,065
You always say
music inspires you.

109
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,533
Pussy inspires me.

110
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,701
I have a pussy.

111
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,036
You have one pussy.

112
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,339
But there's gonna be, like,
hundreds of other pussies.

113
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:09,941
What about just my pussy,
hundreds of times?

114
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,511
That's not as inspiring.

115
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,546
You don't want to lose us.
You don't want to lose this.

116
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:15,714
No. Just no.

117
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,917
All right,
this is the thing.

118
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,353
You don't have
any direction in life.

119
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,654
What does that mean?

120
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,489
It means you're not
going anywhere.

121
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,891
You're not
doing anything.

122
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,860
You know what?
I am so sorry,
honestly

123
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,365
I'm sorry,
but I want to see
other people.

124
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,666
Excuse me?

125
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,501
You're great

126
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,537
but I have
a lot going on
right now.

127
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,572
Yeah, I'm heartbroken.

128
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,607
You're gonna meet
someone so special.

129
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,042
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Bye.

130
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,911
I want you to leave!

131
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,647
You get out of here.

132
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:57,356
Okay, one more for you.

133
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:01,360
Yeah, not for you, Andrew.
You blew it.

134
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,495
<i> Hey, it's Emily.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

135
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:04,896
Ah, em! Listen, honey,

136
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,531
I want you to be
really careful

137
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,900
because there was some kind
of heist in Delaware.

138
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,670
Yeah, and I know you're in
New York and everything

139
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,739
but you can never be
too safe, honey.

140
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,780
Okay. All right.

141
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,450
Okay, guys.

142
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,152
Let's go to bed.

143
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,861
What?

144
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:45,931
What? No!

145
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,706
Thank you. There you go.

146
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,752
Oh!

147
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,089
Poor thing!
You look awful.

148
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:45,924
Thank you.

149
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,926
Who the hell
does he think he is?

150
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,794
How do you know
i didn't break up
with him?

151
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:50,929
Did you?

152
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,030
No.

153
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,064
Of course not.

154
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,766
All right,
this is a long hug.

155
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,268
L know.
One more minute.

156
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,669
I haven't seen you in,
like, forever.

157
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,804
Can we just
move this hug along?

158
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:02,941
Hello, Philip.

159
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,777
Okay, honey.

160
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,079
So you can stay here
for as long as you want.

161
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,214
Carte blanche, okay?

162
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,816
I definitely have
to go back tonight.

163
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,084
Oh, tonight, right?

164
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,319
Tonight, I'm going back.

165
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:16,321
All right.
Well, do what you want.

166
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,223
Thank you.
We're in the kitchen.

167
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,926
Oh, Jeffrey's home?
What a shock.

168
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:21,960
Okay, don't start!

169
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,094
What?

170
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,564
Agoraphobia is
not a joke.

171
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,832
Mama, mama, mama... oh.

172
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,100
Hey, em.

173
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,937
'cause you guys have, like,
the exact same voice.

174
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,572
Okay.
No, we don't.

175
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,940
You have the exact same
haircut, too.

176
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,341
You know who you have
the haircut of?

177
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,043
Who's that?
Harry Potter.

178
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:41,046
Harry Potter is
the greatest
of all the wizards.

179
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,781
He's a hero
and a great role model.

180
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,250
So, I'll take it
as a compliment.

181
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,985
Mom, can I have
a chocolate milk?

182
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,989
Oh, god, mama! Mama!

183
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,991
Yeah?
Very cold!

184
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,259
I didn't heat it up.

185
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,696
Maybe three to four minutes
and get it nice and toasty?

186
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,264
We could toasty-toasty!

187
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,733
Don't ask mom
to toast your bread
for you!

188
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,702
What? Is something wrong
with your legs?

189
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,370
They're in
a seated position.
She's already up.

190
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,372
I'll put the butter
on myself.
Thank you, mama.

191
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,140
Wow, you're gonna
butter it yourself?

192
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:12,877
Does mom feed you
like a baby bird
when I'm not here?

193
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,113
I eat plenty. Don't worry
about my diet. Don't!

194
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,015
Mama! She's showing me
her food in her mouth.

195
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,851
No, I'm not, mom.
I'm chewing
like a person.

196
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:20,986
Then she opened her mouth
and showed it to me.

197
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,220
He's lying again.

198
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,688
Hey, guys!

199
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,256
This is supposed
to be fun.

200
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,158
I know what's going on
with you, man.

201
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,161
You got shot
through the heart.
Okay, Michael's gone.

202
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:33,698
Because you know what?
He was the best
you'll ever do.

203
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,634
Mom, can I eat upstairs?
No!

204
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,736
I would like to eat
right here with you, mom.
Mama.

205
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:38,903
You're so gay for mom.

206
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,005
I'm not gay for mom.

207
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,039
You're gay for mom!

208
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,874
She's a woman.
She has a vagina.

209
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,109
You suck mom's dick.

210
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,279
Guys! Cool it!

211
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,181
If you keep this up,
I'm not cooking anymore

212
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,983
and I'm not feeding you.

213
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,118
Stop it.

214
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,920
Truce.
Truce.

215
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,289
Arthur!
Here, kitty, kitty.

216
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,192
Honey, have you
seen Arthur?
Did he get out?

217
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,228
He's right there.

218
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,163
Oh, good.
Hi, okay.

219
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,331
Does he ever move?

220
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,966
Sweetie,
want to watch a movie?

221
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,701
I don't care, mom.

222
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,369
Oh, honey,
i know you feel so sad.

223
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:15,073
But everything is going
to get better, honey.

224
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,676
I'll tell you,
when dad left

225
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,178
I thought I would
never have sex again.

226
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,247
And I was right.

227
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,918
But I tell you,
i am really, really relieved

228
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,387
that you are not going
on that trip.

229
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,089
Who said I'm not going
on that trip?

230
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,857
I'm definitely going
on that trip.

231
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,958
I'm just trying to pick
which friend

232
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,093
to bring with me
right now

233
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,961
because, like,
everybody wants to go.

234
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,731
I can't deal with
you evaluating my life
right now.

235
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:40,932
Can we just
take the night off?

236
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,100
I'm not in a place.

237
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,168
I get it.

238
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,404
Enough.
Don't do that.

239
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,944
Okay, shadee,
how about instead of rent
this month,

240
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,145
hear me out

241
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:58,416
you cash in on a free trip
to Ecuador?

242
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,087
Come on!

243
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,089
Aren't you, like,
from there?

244
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,728
Uh, no, you're the one
who sounds racist, actually.

245
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,231
Wow, you jumped
to the c-word
pretty fast!

246
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,899
How rude is that?
Oh, shit.

247
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,501
Mom!

248
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,236
Can I borrow a shirt?

249
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,206
Sure, honey.
Go into the hall closet.

250
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,021
<i> Pack your bags.</i>

251
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,056
You're going with me
to Ecuador.

252
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,459
Absolutely not.
Not with my knees.
Not going.

253
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,927
Yes, you are.
No!

254
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,296
Mom! Look what
i just found.

255
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,499
Look at how fun
you were.

256
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,369
Look at that!
I can't even believe
that's you.

257
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,104
Mmm-hmm.

258
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,205
Look at this.

259
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,807
Oh!

260
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,142
That was a long time ago,
honey.

261
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,944
Ma

262
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,079
this would be
so great for you.

263
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:38,383
Oh, everybody knows you need
two years to plan a vacation.

264
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,218
No!
What are you
talking about?

265
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,187
You don't do
anything fun anymore.

266
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:46,524
I go to the y twice a week,
and I take sculpting class.

267
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,359
I mean, look! Voila!

268
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,062
Mom! I told you
i would not
acknowledge that.

269
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,331
That is not right. Okay?

270
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,233
It's your home.
You put it where
you want it,

271
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,101
but it's an
upsetting image.
Okay.

272
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,871
Mom, look,
i didn't want
to do this

273
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,472
but here it goes.

274
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,342
What?

275
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,410
My trip...

276
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,477
Yeah?

277
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,415
...is non-refundable.

278
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,083
Oh, my god!

279
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:16,020
You always book refundable,
Emily! Everybody knows that!

280
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,255
I know, but...

281
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,890
Look, it's done,

282
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,892
and no one else
will go with me.

283
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:21,993
No one.

284
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:25,096
But I booked a journey.

285
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,031
And I refuse

286
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,001
I refuse to let
Michael's decision

287
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,403
dictate whether or not I,
as a woman

288
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,972
go on this trip.

289
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,140
I will embrace
this challenge

290
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,643
in the intrepid spirit

291
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,379
of all the independent
women

292
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,547
who have come
before me.

293
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,985
'Cause it's
upon their shoulders
that I'm standing.

294
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,520
No, I won't back down!

295
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,557
No!

296
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,159
So I stand before you
right now, Linda

297
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,995
and I ask you

298
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,930
will you

299
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,532
Linda, my mother,
middleton

300
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:02,934
join me

301
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,204
on this pilgrimage?

302
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,344
No.

303
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,281
Non-refundable!

304
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,316
Mom!
I can't.

305
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,518
Help me put the "fun"

306
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,988
in non-refundable.

307
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,344
I actually kinda caught
a piece of you, mom.

308
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,413
Could you lean out
a little bit?

309
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,416
That's cute.

310
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,618
Here, put this on.

311
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,186
What is this? What?

312
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,656
That is a rape whistle.

313
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,258
That's a rape whistle.

314
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,592
What?

315
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:04,329
This is
a dog whistle, mom.

316
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,965
Are you afraid these dogs
are gonna rape me?

317
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,066
Is that the main concern?

318
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,233
Can I just see that?

319
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,969
I didn't look
at the dogs.

320
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,270
Do they look like
rapists to you?

321
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:15,473
Why don't you just say,
"thank you, mom"?

322
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,641
Thank you.

323
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,509
"I'm being raped by a dog."

324
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,447
Oh, my god!

325
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,217
It works.

326
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,420
Wow! Mmm-hmm.
Huh?

327
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,726
Welcome.

328
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,160
Oh, thank you. Um

329
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,196
that's check-in, right?
Welcome.

330
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,734
No, no! Thank you so much.
No. Thank you.

331
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,538
This is me.
Thank you.

332
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,309
Oh, thank you
very much.

333
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,278
What's this?
Welcome!

334
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,648
Ma'am!

335
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,250
"Whale" what?

336
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,452
"Welcome."
Oh!

337
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,321
"Welcome."
I'm sorry. Honey!

338
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,455
They're not serving up
whale semen.

339
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,424
I'm so sorry.
I've got it, thank you.

340
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,026
I know,
but that was not good.

341
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,028
Okay.
And I have you down
for a king.

342
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,796
Oh. Nope,
that's not right.

343
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,564
I was supposed to
be a king

344
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,567
but one thing
led to another,
and I changed it.

345
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,269
So, it's two queens now.

346
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,604
Are you sure
you changed it?

347
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,039
Yeah, I called ahead.

348
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,041
I do see that note here.

349
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,710
Okay, well, can you look
at that note

350
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,279
and make that
note happen?

351
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,814
I'm sorry, I cannot.

352
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,050
So I'm just
gonna share

353
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,152
a king-size bed
in a romantic locale

354
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,553
with my mother?

355
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,622
You can sleep
head-to-toe.

356
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,059
Like we're 69-ing.

357
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,194
Great.

358
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,363
I know what that means,
you know. "69-ing."

359
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,731
Really, mom?
What does it mean?

360
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,132
Don't test me.

361
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,744
Hey.
Hi.

362
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,345
You ate lunch
without me.

363
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,115
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

364
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:05,383
And you got a drink.

365
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,085
At 2:00 P.M.

366
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,520
Mmm-hmm. Sure do.

367
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,090
Hey, honey, you're gonna
break your toes in these.

368
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,625
These flip-flops are bad
for your feet.

369
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:15,760
Okay, all right.
I know.

370
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,728
I'm a grown woman,
so I'm fine.

371
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,197
But thank you.

372
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,232
Why are you dressed
like powder?

373
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,600
You look like a beekeeper.

374
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,402
Just get some sun,
is what I'm saying.

375
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,704
The sun
is very dangerous.

376
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:32,743
Mom!

377
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,245
Okay, please.
I just want to fix this.

378
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,748
I don't want you
to get melanoma
in front of my eyes.

379
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,584
Please.
Here. Here.

380
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,720
Mom!

381
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,129
So

382
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,164
I'm just gonna
read my magazine.

383
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,440
Oh, that's nice.

384
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:05,376
I didn't know they had
a day care program
at the hotel.

385
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,312
So, I don't get it.

386
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,314
It's gross.
It is gross.

387
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,685
Oh, god!

388
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,821
Have you talked
to your dad lately?

389
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,457
Mmm-mmm. I think he's still
in Florida with Susan.

390
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,430
Let's go out tonight.

391
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:27,798
What? No, I can't.

392
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,301
Yeah, you and me.
We're going out.

393
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,270
No, no, no.
Why?

394
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,605
Hair, make-up, boobs.
We're going out.

395
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,440
Come on.
Don't do this.

396
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:40,444
Emily, I am not going
strolling in Ecuador
at night.

397
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:41,679
You're such
a scaredy-cat.

398
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,314
This is what
I'm talking about.

399
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,482
You're gonna miss
this whole trip.

400
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,350
Everything shouldn't be
so scary.

401
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,352
Oh, it damn well
should.

402
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,621
Okay, thank you.

403
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,357
Name's Ruth. Traveling with
my best friend, Barb.

404
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,494
We usually go to
the Arizona gem show
every year.

405
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:59,463
But this year,
Barb got a deal
on this resort.

406
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,865
Well, enjoy it.

407
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,300
Ecuador's a pretty place.

408
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,468
No arguing that.

409
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,970
But you can't
let your guard down.

410
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,339
That is right.
That is exactly right.

411
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,607
A lot of terrible things

412
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,375
happen outside
these little gates.

413
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,744
Exactly. See?
The world's a scary place.

414
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,348
One in four tourists in
south America are kidnapped.

415
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,583
What? Incredible!

416
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,850
Not true.

417
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,352
Totally true.

418
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,388
One, two, three,
somebody's missing.

419
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,489
It's false.

420
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:29,493
Anyway, Barb retired
last year. Oh, look!

421
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,230
That's her over there.
Finally getting some peace.

422
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,764
You know,
she was in special ops.

423
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,600
And she's seen some shit.

424
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,368
Hi, Barb!

425
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,271
Special ops!
Wow, that's
very interesting.

426
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,842
Oh, don't bother
waiting for a response.

427
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:48,246
Barb cut her own tongue out
when she left the service.

428
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,380
Precautionary measures

429
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,449
to prevent from
being interrogated

430
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,517
for top secret information.

431
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,919
Couldn't they just
torture her

432
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,455
into writing down
the information?

433
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,862
Well, anyway,
i best get going.

434
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,898
Here's my number,
in case you guys want
to grab dinner

435
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,667
or lunch, or breakfast,
or a snack.

436
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,002
Okay.

437
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:13,404
Or just kinda sit,
you know?

438
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,605
Just sittin'.

439
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,741
Thank you, Ruth.
Thank you so much.

440
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,676
See you at dinner.

441
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,680
- Wow.
- Well

442
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:26,384
I'm going to be having
a lovely evening
here tonight

443
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,286
reading my novellas.

444
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,688
Well, I'm going to get ready
and have a drink.

445
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,423
What a shock.

446
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,049
Hey, do you mind
if I join you?

447
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,918
Hey, that dude...

448
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,687
Oh, no. Uh, sorry.

449
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:03,754
You.

450
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,590
Mind if I join you?

451
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,460
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, come over.

452
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,861
Please.

453
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,997
Uh, not you. It was me.
Excuse me?

454
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,666
Could you kind of beat it?
'Cause you're a distraction.

455
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,702
Hey, how are you?
I'm James.

456
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:18,969
Emily.
Hi, Emily.

457
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,604
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

458
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,006
What happened
to your arm?

459
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,874
Did you try to kill yourself
'cause you're so ugly?

460
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,345
No, I, um

461
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,413
I've just spent the past
few weeks in koh phangan.

462
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:32,850
And my last day there I kept
thinking about that quote

463
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,719
"man cannot discover
new oceans

464
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:38,689
"unless he has the courage
to lose sight of the shore."

465
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,425
Wow, I love that
you don't

466
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:42,893
care about sounding
like a weirdo.

467
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,995
Well, you know,

468
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:47,031
I wanted a tattoo
to symbolize that

469
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,368
but I'm pretty sure
i must have been wasted

470
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,002
because I don't know
what borat has to do

471
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,137
with any of that.

472
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,572
That is brutal.

473
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:55,840
Yeah, it is.

474
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,508
But, actually,
i can beat that.

475
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,776
Look at this.
Okay.

476
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:01,045
I got this.
I was 18, okay?

477
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,780
Look at that.
It's raised.

478
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,648
Touch it, it's raised.
That is horrible.

479
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,450
I got it
at the worst place.

480
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:07,651
And my skirt's
over my head.

481
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:11,922
I mean,
people have certainly
finished on it.

482
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,924
I'm sorry.

483
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,460
I'm trying to, like,
be funny for you.

484
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,662
So, here you are.
How come you're here?

485
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,464
I'm a model.
I'm here, modeling.

486
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,900
So you're not here
with your boyfriend?

487
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,068
Is he a model, too?

488
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,003
Uh, no, I'm just here
with, um

489
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,406
my

490
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,776
my mom.

491
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,477
Hey, that's so crazy
you're here with your mom

492
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,678
because I'm here
with my mom.

493
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,747
Really?

494
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,048
No, absolutely not.

495
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,951
That would be so sad,
because I'm an adult.

496
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,720
It's pronounced "adult."

497
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,190
You've been to Egypt?
What were you saying?

498
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,758
No, yeah,
i went to Egypt.

499
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,693
I know it's kind of
dangerous right now.

500
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,962
But, I've hiked up
mountains in Iran.

501
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,432
I've run with the bulls
in Spain.

502
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,034
I've eaten poisonous
blowfish in Japan.

503
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:59,804
To me, those are the moments
that make life worth living.

504
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,806
I love everything
you're saying.

505
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,975
Your instagram
must be insane.

506
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:08,078
Oh, well, no. I'm not really
on any of those things.

507
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
How can anybody
see what you do?

508
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,183
Well, they don't.
But I get to live it.

509
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,122
Do you wanna do
something tonight?

510
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,090
Like, something crazy,

511
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,926
or can we do
something amazing?

512
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:27,731
I'm sure we can rustle up
some adventure tonight.

513
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,533
Yes!
Yeah.

514
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,671
Everything okay
over here, Emily?

515
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,573
I met them at the pool.
Oh, you guys.

516
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:38,008
Remember, never have more
drinks than you have tits.

517
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,477
Two tits, two drinks.

518
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,845
I know how many tits
i have.

519
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:42,012
Please, go away.

520
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,881
Did you just give me
danger eyes?

521
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,616
I don't even know what
"danger eyes" is.

522
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:48,018
I gave you
get-the-fuck-outta here eyes.
Go away.

523
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,620
It was like this.

524
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,021
That's kind of a thing.
I didn't make that face.

525
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,156
I think you...

526
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,257
That's danger eyes.

527
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:54,492
Go.

528
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:55,960
Go away.

529
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,832
Ride or die.

530
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,137
Barb, you're wilin' out
right now.

531
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,106
Thank you, Barb. Okay.

532
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,991
Hey.

533
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,693
Hey.

534
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,628
That was not
what it looked like.

535
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,165
I was just washing my vagina
in case we hooked up.

536
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,900
That is what
it looked like.

537
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,268
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

538
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,038
'Cause when I drink sometimes
it smells like soup.

539
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,006
Hey, do you know what?
Shall we?

540
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,975
Yeah?

541
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:20,010
Hey, what kind of soup?

542
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,246
Um, that is none
of your business.

543
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,907
Really? What? What?

544
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:52,943
Slow down. You're like...

545
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,145
Here we go.

546
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,280
What is this?

547
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,815
Check it out.

548
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,851
No.

549
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,886
Oh, my god!

550
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:04,755
What do you think?

551
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,123
I can't believe this.

552
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,758
I know.
They just sort of pop up.

553
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,326
Is this like a tree
or something?

554
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,894
It is a tree.

555
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,663
You're gonna know all these
people by the end of it.

556
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:13,764
Yes.

557
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:14,965
<i> Hola!</i>
Just two of those.

558
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,041
That's Capoeira.

559
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,670
Oh, shit!

560
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,705
Uh, I'm really sorry.
She's never done that before.

561
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:57,775
I think you might have
killed the guy.

562
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,109
Holy shit.
I'm sorry.

563
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,983
Oh, this is nice.
Right?

564
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:07,251
That's made of glass.

565
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:08,719
Yeah, it is.

566
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,788
And the elevator there
is made of steel.

567
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,456
And you are okay
finding your room?

568
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:14,925
Oh. Yeah.

569
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:17,194
No, I had a buzz earlier.

570
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,963
But it's gone now.

571
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,865
Uh...

572
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,301
Your tit's out.

573
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,771
Your tit's out, too.

574
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,841
No, your tit
is actually

575
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:31,942
emerged.

576
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,049
I thought
i felt a breeze.

577
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,952
Will you excuse me?

578
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,320
Oh, no.
Yeah, absolutely.

579
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,761
God, I wish
i could invite you up.

580
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,396
But I can't.

581
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,398
I have to 69 my mom.

582
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Well, how about,
then

583
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:59,403
you set your alarm
for 9:00 a.M

584
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,406
and we will go
on another adventure?

585
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:05,342
Yeah! I would love it.

586
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,245
Oh, shit.

587
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,813
I got my mom.

588
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:11,148
No, bring her.

589
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,816
It'll be fun.

590
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:15,119
Oh, my god! James!

591
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:18,155
That's all right.
The pleasure's
gonna be mine.

592
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,490
So, you get off to bed

593
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,225
and I will see you
tomorrow.

594
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,095
I'll see you
tomorrow, too.

595
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,814
Oh!

596
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,794
Sorry.

597
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:01,265
Mom,
i had the best night.

598
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,535
I learned the capoa.

599
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:07,871
You do that.
And I danced with a lady.

600
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:10,007
I'm okay.

601
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,943
And we twerked.

602
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,278
Did you ever twerk, ma?

603
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,813
No.
It's easy.

604
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,214
You just loosen
your lower back,

605
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:18,816
and you kind of jump.

606
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,417
Are you getting it?
Yeah.

607
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,953
I was doing it
better before.

608
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:26,223
What is this haunted swan
doing here?

609
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:28,091
Scram, swan!

610
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,894
Mom

611
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,063
I met a man.

612
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,464
Yeah?

613
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:38,101
I met a real man.

614
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,838
Well, drinking with a man
in a foreign country...

615
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,441
You know? It's a smart,
responsible thing to do.

616
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:50,848
I know that
that is Sincere,
and I thank you.

617
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,217
You missed
a maleficent night.

618
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:55,352
Well, I'm sorry.
Go to sleep.

619
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,921
I can't get in.
It's too tight, mom.

620
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:58,989
Just, here...

621
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,257
Just put your feet
under there.

622
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,458
It's so tight.

623
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,593
It's tight,
but it will untighten.

624
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:04,127
What are they
trying to prove?

625
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:05,262
Just go to sleep, honey.

626
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:08,966
I know, I'm sure.
Yeah, whatever.
Wait till tomorrow.

627
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:12,035
He's gonna take us
on a day trip.

628
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:16,039
No, I'm not.
I'm gonna read my book,
is what I'm gonna do.

629
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,274
I've got ten pages left.

630
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,509
Now that I'm awake.

631
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:22,246
And hopefully you won't start
drunk-snoring till I'm done.

632
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:24,081
Do you wanna know
how this book ends?

633
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,482
I do. Absolutely.

634
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:26,650
Then the only way
you're gonna find out

635
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:29,653
This is my book now.
This is not your book.

636
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,121
Yes, it is.
This is my book.

637
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:35,425
Oh, really?
Well, you're too old
to be acting like this.

638
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:36,526
Now, give me my book!

639
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:37,594
No!

640
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,463
You're coming!

641
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,265
You wanna know
how this ends, Linda?

642
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:42,332
Yeah, I do.

643
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,334
You will come tomorrow.

644
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:45,969
What did you do?

645
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:48,639
I've got 'em right here
in my chi-chas.

646
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,474
Chi-cha?

647
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:53,477
I'll see you
and James tomorrow.

648
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:54,945
God, Emily,
this isn't fun.

649
00:31:54,947 --> 00:31:56,146
Good night.

650
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:00,617
Oh!

651
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,386
Emily, please.

652
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,621
It was the swan.

653
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,702
Ah!

654
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,582
Ma!

655
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,084
Is he looking at me?

656
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,153
Is James looking?

657
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:37,554
No, he's not.

658
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,022
Here he comes.

659
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,558
Here we go.

660
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,260
Yes!
Here you go.

661
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:44,962
Thank you!
Thanks.

662
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,497
Hey, cheers!

663
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,299
Ooh, cheers!
Cheers.

664
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,434
What's in it?

665
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:53,403
He said it was
a secret family recipe
or something.

666
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,205
Oh, really?

667
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:56,306
It's good.

668
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,710
'Cause I was thinking
maybe we could take
the scenic route.

669
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:01,278
We're gonna
go past waterfalls.

670
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,713
I always see about
12 rainbows.

671
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:04,715
It's insane.
Or, if you want

672
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:07,517
we could just take the old,
boring, dusty highway.

673
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,553
I'll take the old,
dusty highway.

674
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,188
What? Do you
hear yourself?

675
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,990
Why are you
a life-ruiner?

676
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:14,291
Do you know what?

677
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,592
She is kind of right
'cause I think we'd save

678
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,260
probably a whole

679
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,029
five minutes.

680
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,697
So...
Okay.

681
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,332
Waterfalls and rainbows.

682
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,388
Where the hell are we?

683
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,190
Oh, we're just coming up
on a really beautiful view.

684
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,227
Do you guys have any service?
I have, like, no bars.

685
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:51,595
It's not letting me
post anything.

686
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,576
All right. That's it.

687
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:09,312
Let's just get us
on the main road, please.

688
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:10,647
Are you sure?

689
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,315
I mean,
this really is the way

690
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,051
to experience the culture,
you know.

691
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:15,152
No, thank you.

692
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:16,286
Mom, it's fine.
I'm sure.

693
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,055
No, it's absolutely not!

694
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:20,791
Just get us out, you know,
back, okay? And now!

695
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:22,059
I want you to
do it right now.

696
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:25,128
That's okay. Listen,
I'm really sorry, guys.

697
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,532
Listen, I'm just gonna have
to turn around up here

698
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:29,833
and then we'll get back
to the road.

699
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:31,268
What was the name
of that dance

700
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,569
that we were doing
the other night?

701
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,337
Mom, you should have seen it.
Oh, my god!

702
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,672
Capoeira!
Capoeira!

703
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,564
Oh, my god!

704
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,632
Are you okay?

705
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:03,700
Oh, my god!

706
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,435
Where are we?

707
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,374
Why would they take us?
Oh, my god!

708
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,344
Oh, fuck! Ew. Ew.

709
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,246
Mom, why aren't
you talking?

710
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:18,381
Because I'm trying
to remain calm.

711
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,618
And when I think about
where we are

712
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,220
and what's happening,
i start to panic.

713
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:24,788
And I don't
want to panic.

714
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,791
So I have chosen
to believe

715
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,127
that I am reading
a very compelling article

716
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,796
on local farming practices.

717
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,664
What the fuck is that?
Is that porn?

718
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,133
Because

719
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,135
when I think
about all this...

720
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,803
I get upset!

721
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:40,904
Oh, my god.

722
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:44,541
So I'm moving on
to another article

723
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,376
about this woman's asshole.

724
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:49,412
Because I just don't know
what else to do.

725
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,514
Oh, my god!

726
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:53,517
Do you think they're
holding him here?

727
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:54,918
Oh, Emily, don't you know

728
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,420
that James is part
of all this, honey?

729
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,356
How can my daughter
be so foolish?

730
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,691
How could she
just not know this?

731
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,828
I am sorry
that this happened.

732
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,664
But I will get us
out of here, okay?

733
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,299
I'm gonna call...

734
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,503
Oh, my god.
They took my phone.

735
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,306
Oh, my god,
they took my phone!

736
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:19,276
It's fine.
That's fine.

737
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:20,844
We just gather
raw materials.

738
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,312
Okay, we...

739
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:24,681
And we make a shiv.
I saw this.

740
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,183
No.
I saw it. Yes!

741
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:28,285
No. We fight, we lose.

742
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:30,287
Holy shit!

743
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,888
What are you
holy-shitting about?

744
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:37,327
Oh, the blood on the wall?
Oh, well, that's there.

745
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:39,963
Hey, how about the scorpion,
over there in the corner?

746
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:43,200
What? Oh, my god!
It's a fucking scorpion!

747
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,467
Mom, you have to kill it.

748
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,303
I'm not gonna kill it.
Kill it!

749
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:47,637
I can't kill it.

750
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,708
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

751
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,742
Where have you taken us?

752
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:53,877
I have a few questions.

753
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,745
We have a very
high-up family,

754
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,314
and you're in
a lot of trouble.

755
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:59,316
What the fuck is this?

756
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:01,351
That is heat-activated
birth control, sir,

757
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:02,886
so please
keep that refrigerated.

758
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:05,355
This was a day.
This was a day trip.

759
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:07,624
I know, but I like to be
prepared. It's important.

760
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,559
What's your pin number?

761
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,728
One

762
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,796
two

763
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,432
three

764
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,368
four.

765
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,436
Oh, god.

766
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:20,870
I was gonna change it.

767
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,772
Do you have husband?

768
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,774
I am divorced.

769
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:27,310
I also don't have
a husband yet.

770
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,879
What about Jeffrey?
My son, Jeffrey.

771
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:34,484
Oh, my god.
Our lives depend
on Jeffrey.

772
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,455
Shit.
What you're doing is shit.

773
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:40,490
It sucks.

774
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,927
Okay,
just think about
how to be better.

775
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,366
You got Jeffrey.

776
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:50,900
<i> Hello, Jeffrey.</i>

777
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:53,803
We have your mother
and your sister.

778
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,538
And you will now
pay ransom.

779
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,673
Pardon?

780
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:57,874
<i> $100,000.</i>

781
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,376
Wired by noon tomorrow.

782
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,478
<i> Okay, I don't know</i>
<i> who this is,</i>

783
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,545
but if you keep
pranking me,

784
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:03,680
I will report it
to the police.

785
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:05,015
It will become
a police matter,

786
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:06,816
and you will go to jail.
Okay?

787
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:09,286
I'm with Jacob right now.
It's his piano lesson.

788
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,387
So fuck off.

789
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,622
Unfortunately,

790
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:13,823
for Linda and Emily

791
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,292
<i> it is very real.</i>

792
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:16,893
Await further instructions.

793
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:20,563
Mama? Hello! Hello!

794
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:33,777
Oh, my god.

795
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,722
Not too bad.

796
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:48,725
However, I have to move you,
and that is annoying to me.

797
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,428
Fortunately,
you have not
made me angry.

798
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,365
Should you ever
make me angry

799
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:58,668
I will skin you alive
while your mother watches.

800
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:02,906
What does that mean?
Oh, god.

801
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:05,108
Oh, my god. No! No!

802
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,609
Fight, mom. Fight!

803
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:07,744
Fight, mom!

804
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:10,013
Go limp. Go limp!

805
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,715
No!
Go limp.

806
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,355
I have a real phobia
about this.

807
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:19,956
Of what?
Being locked in
a car trunk?

808
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,459
Yeah, I think everybody's
got that one, mom.

809
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,030
Oh, my god!
I feel like I can get this.

810
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,865
It's loosening.

811
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,934
Hold on.
Wait, I think I got it.

812
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:33,002
Oh! Okay.
Do me! Do me!

813
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,941
No. I don't care.
Okay.

814
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,043
Okay. It's off.

815
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,511
Oh, my god.

816
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:47,917
Oh, my god.
We're stopped.

817
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,753
Okay, he's out.
What do we do?

818
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:51,888
These people were trapped
in a trunk,

819
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,124
Wait, wires?
I feel some wires.

820
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:55,458
Just grab it?
Yeah.

821
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,926
Should I pull it?
Yes.

822
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,862
Oh!
Oh, we're out! Okay.

823
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:04,868
Okay.

824
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,838
Okay, this way, come on.

825
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,673
Mom, what are you doing?
My knees.

826
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:11,741
Keep up!

827
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,543
Oh, shit!

828
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:15,645
I told you not to wear
your flip-flops!

829
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,881
It wasn't
flip-flop related, mother.

830
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:20,683
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

831
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,991
Oh, shit!
Go, mom!

832
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,726
Go!
<i> Ola!</i>

833
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:31,127
Oh, my god!

834
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,629
Mom! Come on!

835
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:34,130
I'm trying!

836
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,501
Come on!
I'm coming.

837
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:39,836
Watch out, mom!
He's right behind you!

838
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:41,638
Emily!
Come on!

839
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,173
Oh, my god.

840
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,508
Come on!

841
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:49,813
He's got my leg!

842
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:19,843
This is the end of the line,
whatever that means.

843
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,911
Come on, honey.

844
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,980
Ma, do you think there's
any way that, like,

845
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,682
maybe that guy's okay?

846
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,485
I saw his brains.

847
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,186
Why can't you just
make me feel better?

848
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,623
Oh, my god.
Thank you so much.

849
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,091
You are such a sweetie.

850
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,166
What? Hector morgado?

851
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,071
This is...

852
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,606
Honey, he's nervous.

853
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,209
Wait,
where are you going?

854
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,577
Where are you going?

855
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:56,045
Should we get
back in here?

856
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,614
What are we
supposed to do?

857
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,050
Okay, we gotta get
out of here. Let's go.

858
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:03,953
What we need to focus
on is that we got out.

859
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,588
I don't know
why I let you talk me

860
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,923
into this
in the first place.

861
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:08,291
I should have stayed
at the hotel.

862
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:10,860
I can't fight with you
right now. I'm starving.

863
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:11,995
Do you hear
my stomach?

864
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:14,097
It's, like, crazy.
I'm so hungry.

865
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,000
- Oh, my god.
- A phone!

866
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:19,569
A Turkey leg!

867
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:21,037
Mmm-hmm,
hold on one second.

868
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,139
State department,
this is Morgan.

869
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,041
Please listen
very carefully to me, sir.

870
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,809
My mother and i
have been kidnapped.

871
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,244
Mmm, okay,
where are you guys now?

872
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,580
Puerto Matias.

873
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:32,849
That's in Southern Colombia.
Let me pull that up.

874
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:34,584
Will you hold on
for one second?

875
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,286
They took us to Colombia.
It's fine, it's fine.

876
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:38,588
It's just a different...

877
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,822
Zip code.
It's so far.

878
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:42,625
Okay, go ahead and get out
a pencil and paper for me.

879
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:44,861
And write down "calle..."

880
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:48,798
Is this a tall building
that we need to get to

881
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,300
so you can pick us up
on the top of it?

882
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:51,668
That's the address
of the nearest

883
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,002
us consulate in Bogota.

884
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:56,306
Okay, but you have
to actually come get us

885
00:42:56,308 --> 00:43:00,009
because we are Americans
in peril. So...

886
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:02,312
<i> but any time you</i>
<i> travel internationally,</i>

887
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:06,282
Most of Colombia
is beautiful and
very safe now.

888
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:07,917
<i> With the exception</i>
<i> of puerto Matias,</i>

889
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,686
<i> which is very much not.</i>

890
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,054
<i> So trust no one.</i>

891
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:14,324
And thanks for calling
the us state department.

892
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,598
You talked to him.
What'd he say?

893
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,368
I think we're gonna need
to make another phone call.

894
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,070
We're gonna get you
out of this.

895
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:29,639
I don't know if you remember
me telling you this

896
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:31,708
but Barb was
in the special ops.

897
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,077
So she's highly trained
for this type of situation.

898
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,878
Let me tell you a story
about Barb.

899
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,047
We're on a limited time card.
We really need...

900
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:39,916
1991, Kuwait.

901
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:41,217
<i> Hot as fuck...</i>

902
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,285
Hello?

903
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,620
Hello?

904
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,657
Oh, my god.

905
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:49,158
This place seems okay.

906
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,696
Hi.

907
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:56,399
Hi. When does
the next bus leave?

908
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,803
Bus doesn't leave
for about 36 hours.

909
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,005
Oh, my god.

910
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:04,641
But I know a man
who can take care of you.

911
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:07,043
Oh, yeah,
I'm sure he could.
Mmm-hmm.

912
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:09,178
This is how sex slavery
starts, honey.

913
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,649
Listen, no.
You don't have to
worry about that.

914
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,717
Those kinds of people want
young, beautiful females.

915
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,686
You're safe.

916
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:18,888
Oh, well, yeah.
That's good.

917
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,189
Okay, how dare you!

918
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:22,258
Like, that is so rude.

919
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,693
That's crazy.
Well, honey.

920
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:25,261
No. Like, how dare you.
That's my mother.

921
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:27,797
Okay, fine.
But if you think
it would be safer

922
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:29,198
for me to kind of,
like

923
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,867
go hide and then
she meets your friend

924
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:32,035
who knows
how to get us to the...

925
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:33,369
No, I don't want you
to do that.

926
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:35,171
No, you're both safe.

927
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,173
How do you mean?

928
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,975
Your poofy face
will protect you.

929
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,345
But, over there,
that man is who I mean.

930
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,717
Can I help you, ma'ams?

931
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:49,152
He's American.
America!

932
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,388
Oh, my god.
We're Americans. Hi.

933
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,357
I'm Emily and this is Linda.
Hi, I'm Linda.

934
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,059
You don't even understand
the ordeal

935
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:57,293
that we have just
been through.

936
00:44:57,295 --> 00:45:00,129
We really need to
get to the us consulate in

937
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:01,764
Bogota?
Right.

938
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:02,865
As soon as possible,
kind of.

939
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,801
So, if you know
the easiest way.

940
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:05,968
The easy way?

941
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,110
They were laughing
at something else.

942
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:16,012
You're not going to find
that in Colombia.

943
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,316
Ah, you've got
mountain ranges
to the north.

944
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:21,451
Mom, come on.

945
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:23,920
Jungles to
the east and west.

946
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:27,290
And, well, the mighty one,
the river,
she's to the south.

947
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,259
There is no easy trek.

948
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:31,994
There's a reason
they call Colombia

949
00:45:31,996 --> 00:45:33,796
"the sack of the Jaguar."

950
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:35,832
I never heard of that before.
I'll tell you what.

951
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:37,934
I've got a slow boat,
headed down river.

952
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:39,969
I can take you east
along the Amazon

953
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:42,905
We should be able to
drop you off close enough

954
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,141
that you can
make it to Bogota without
too much trouble.

955
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:46,209
Name's Roger Simmons.

956
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:47,477
The boat's docked
just out back.

957
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:49,879
Crew's getting her seaworthy
as we speak. So...

958
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:51,914
I'll check in with them
then come back for you.

959
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:52,982
Thank you.

960
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:54,050
<i> Senor!</i>

961
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,220
Chicken wings
for the ladies.

962
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,890
You're safe with me.

963
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,492
Thank you.

964
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:05,394
Yeah!

965
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:06,896
Slow boat!

966
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:08,030
Slow boat.

967
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,432
You wanna
get the chicken wings?

968
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:10,867
That'd be great.

969
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,179
Ma, stop.
Don't, like, caress me.

970
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:26,816
You look just like you did
when you were three.

971
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:28,851
Okay. You need to start
dating again.

972
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:30,253
What?
Yeah, you do.

973
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:32,922
Oh, please.
Don't start with
this again.

974
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:35,024
Why?
I've been there,
done that.

975
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:36,559
All right,
I'm gonna pee.

976
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:37,994
Don't let them
take the wings away.

977
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:39,095
Okay, honey.

978
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,135
Oh, my god. Help!

979
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,070
Mom! Oh, my god! Ow!

980
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:52,942
Oh, my god.

981
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:56,412
That's him.

982
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:58,247
That's the guy.
Oh, god.

983
00:46:58,249 --> 00:46:59,916
Hi, sir.

984
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:01,017
Remember us?

985
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:02,118
Shut the fuck up.

986
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,088
Why did you come
to south America?

987
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,356
I didn't want to come.
I never wanted to come.

988
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:09,292
For the cultural
experience

989
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:11,360
and the red cross.

990
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:12,595
You come down here

991
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:14,330
you stay
at your fancy resort

992
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,499
clutching your pearls.

993
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,034
Look at my people
like you are at the zoo.

994
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,335
What the fuck?

995
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,270
You offer nothing
here to them.

996
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:22,972
And you take everything.

997
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,041
And then

998
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,511
you kill my only nephew.

999
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:29,846
Oh!

1000
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:31,480
Oh, my god.
Oh, no. No.

1001
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:33,149
- We had no idea.
- We didn't know.

1002
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:34,951
- We're new in town.
- We're very new.

1003
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:36,252
He was cute.

1004
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:39,522
You should have seen him
in those last moments.

1005
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,891
I'm sorry.
But listen,
you kidnapped us.

1006
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:44,227
And that's what
motivated that.
So, like

1007
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:45,294
that is on you.

1008
00:47:45,296 --> 00:47:46,629
Okay. What?
Wait a minute.

1009
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:48,431
She's really
such a good kid.

1010
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:50,199
She is garbage.

1011
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,467
No.

1012
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:53,169
Yeah. Yes.

1013
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:54,971
Yes, I am.
Yes, you are.

1014
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:57,607
I am garbage.
I have never voted.

1015
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:00,309
I don't know any Spanish.
I only know one word.

1016
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,545
What they called me at my job
at the restaurant.<i> Puta!</i>

1017
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:03,946
Which I don't know
what it means.

1018
00:48:03,948 --> 00:48:05,348
"Princess" or
"pretty" or...

1019
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,383
It means "whore."

1020
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,885
That checks out.

1021
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:11,087
You took someone
from my family.

1022
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,357
I must take someone
from yours.

1023
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:19,061
That is the way it is.
I didn't make the rules.

1024
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,329
Not this one.

1025
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,032
Mom.

1026
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:24,934
Okay. Okay.

1027
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:26,969
Hold on. Look!

1028
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:28,604
A spear gun.

1029
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:31,340
and I want you
to threaten him with it.

1030
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:32,441
Okay, I'm gonna
distract them.

1031
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:33,509
Where are you going?

1032
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:34,944
I'm gonna distract them!

1033
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:36,345
You're distracting them?

1034
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:47,189
My son!

1035
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:49,525
My son! My only son!

1036
00:48:50,662 --> 00:48:51,928
What?

1037
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,996
Kill them!

1038
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:55,998
I told you
to threaten him.

1039
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,101
Someone order a boat
with a side of adventure?

1040
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,203
Shut the fuck up, Roger!

1041
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:04,540
My son! My only son!

1042
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,075
- Go!
- Let's go!

1043
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:07,276
Manuel! Quickly, the boat!

1044
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,477
Come on, mom!

1045
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,518
This is Morgan Russell.

1046
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,253
Yes! Morgan Russell!

1047
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:18,387
I'm the one
that's been calling

1048
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:21,457
and their situation
down in south America.

1049
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,725
Let's go get 'em.
What's the plan?

1050
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:25,261
Right, so, I told her
to contact me

1051
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:29,065
There's not much more
i can do,
unfortunately, sir.

1052
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:33,269
Okay, I imagine that
you have some kind of

1053
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:37,306
<i> Maybe, like,</i>
<i> four underground</i>
<i> criminals</i>

1054
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,742
who were tried for a crime
they didn't commit.

1055
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:41,577
<i> And they've been living</i>
<i> in the underground</i>

1056
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,279
kinda helping people
along the way, almost

1057
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:44,547
sir, were you born
in the '70s?

1058
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:47,516
That sounds like<i> the a-team.</i>
It is<i> the a-team.</i>

1059
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:49,285
Do you have an<i> a-team?</i>

1060
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:52,121
We actually disbanded that
program in 1994, sir.

1061
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:53,255
Fuck! Shit!

1062
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:55,725
<i> Pull out a pen</i>
<i> and a piece of paper.</i>

1063
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:59,261
<i> And write down, "if you feel</i>
<i> the urge to call again</i>

1064
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:00,663
"resist it."

1065
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,164
Wait. That's the advice?

1066
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,399
That's what
you're giving me?

1067
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:04,467
Yep.

1068
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:45,441
I don't remember
the last time
i had a drink.

1069
00:50:46,778 --> 00:50:49,311
Mom, you need to relax.
All right?

1070
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:50,446
You're stressing me out.

1071
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:54,650
The most terrifying man
i ever saw in my life

1072
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:55,718
was going to cut us up

1073
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,720
in little pieces
with his machete.

1074
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:01,323
And that was before
you murdered his son.

1075
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:03,259
Accidentally murdered.

1076
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:05,061
But, mom.
What?

1077
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:07,430
Can we focus on the positive?
Because we are safe now.

1078
00:51:07,432 --> 00:51:08,631
We're safe?

1079
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,534
You think we're safe?

1080
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,202
Yeah, we're safe.
We're on a boat.

1081
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:15,337
Look how fast
they found us!

1082
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:17,306
I mean, I'm going to be
looking over my shoulder

1083
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:18,841
for the rest of my life.

1084
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:20,443
And then
when I go to sleep
at night,

1085
00:51:20,445 --> 00:51:25,614
of that spear going
into that man's throat.
Ugh!

1086
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:27,450
Why would you
bring that up, mom?

1087
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:28,617
Can't you just
comfort me?

1088
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,486
Can you just please
be my parent

1089
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:31,754
and make me feel better?

1090
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,089
Do you want me
to make you feel better?

1091
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:34,156
Yes.

1092
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:37,293
You are
a very gifted murderer.

1093
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:39,595
Okay.

1094
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:43,165
just because you
can't control
this exact situation

1095
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,367
does not mean
you have to
lash out at me.

1096
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,570
I can't stop my hands
from shaking, honey.

1097
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:49,305
Maybe you need to chill out
with the drinking,

1098
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:50,873
just a little bit, mom.

1099
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:53,642
Look, Roger is gonna
get us home.

1100
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:55,111
Let's focus on that.

1101
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:56,745
Roger's going to
get us home

1102
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:59,615
just like James
was taking you out
on a date.

1103
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:00,749
Get it?

1104
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,351
Judgment.

1105
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:04,353
Linda, Emily.

1106
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:05,788
Luis, here, just got word

1107
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,523
that there's a boat
50 klicks back

1108
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:09,525
looking for two
American women.

1109
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:11,193
Oh, god.
Oh, my god.

1110
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:13,129
Now, see? What'd I tell you?
Okay, okay.

1111
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:16,899
We have no choice but
to slip off now onto a canoe.

1112
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:19,535
I'll guide you through
the sack of the Jaguar.

1113
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:21,270
Oh uh...

1114
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:23,339
You know, it's funny.

1115
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:24,607
I've been looking
for adventure

1116
00:52:24,609 --> 00:52:27,143
ever since I got to this
godforsaken land.

1117
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:30,412
And now, well, now

1118
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:32,882
it looks like
adventure's found me.

1119
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,584
Yeah.
Yeah, it has.

1120
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:52,768
Oh, I'm weak, honey.

1121
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,703
You should eat something.

1122
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:57,773
Hey, Roger.
Is this fruit okay?

1123
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,309
Sure.

1124
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:01,810
Okay.

1125
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:03,312
Oh, wait, do you mean, like,
is it poisonous?

1126
00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:05,181
I don't know. Probably.

1127
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:06,649
Oh, my god!

1128
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:10,419
There's always a risk if you
want to feast on the sack.

1129
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:13,255
At some point, you're gonna
have to pick your poison.

1130
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:14,690
Starvation

1131
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:15,925
or poison.

1132
00:53:15,927 --> 00:53:17,593
Mmm.

1133
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:19,361
<i> Vatmonos.</i>

1134
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,232
Oh!

1135
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,202
Ow!

1136
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:31,340
how soggy the wood was
when I tried to light it?

1137
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:32,408
So weird.

1138
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,876
Linda, thanks
for stepping up.

1139
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:35,211
You really did a great job.

1140
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:36,478
Yeah. It's awesome, mom.

1141
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,280
Thanks, honey.

1142
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:40,482
Roger, why don't you
tell us a story?

1143
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:43,219
You've been an expedition
guide for forever, right?

1144
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:45,487
Expedition guide?
Oh, that's flattering.

1145
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:46,722
I haven't heard
that one before.

1146
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,290
Yeah, my story.

1147
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,559
Uh, I've been here

1148
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,362
three long weeks now.

1149
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:55,497
First time on a plane.

1150
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:57,433
'Til recently, I was a gm
at a trader Joe's

1151
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:58,701
up in Rochester.

1152
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:00,703
Although,
one could say that

1153
00:54:00,705 --> 00:54:02,238
the way that store
was managed,

1154
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,372
that was the real jungle.

1155
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:07,243
And then, well,
my doctor said I was sick.

1156
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:09,645
So, I said to myself,
"Roger! What the heck?"

1157
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:11,013
"Go on down
to south America."

1158
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:12,648
Oh, god. Are you ill?

1159
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,017
Hmm? Yes, ma'am.
Caught the travel bug.

1160
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:16,552
Oh, the travel bug.

1161
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:17,853
I thought
he was saying...

1162
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,521
And cancer.

1163
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:21,924
Doc gave me, oh,
a month to live,

1164
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,626
which gives me about
a week now, so, yeah.

1165
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:24,994
I mean, because you're
not just gonna

1166
00:54:24,996 --> 00:54:27,630
walk on in
to the Amazon

1167
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:29,932
if you're expecting
to walk on out.

1168
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,467
And so, yeah.

1169
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,471
No.
Sure.

1170
00:54:35,473 --> 00:54:36,739
We got a big day
tomorrow, huh?

1171
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,941
So I think we need to catch
a little shut-eye.

1172
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,776
Someone needs
to stand watch.

1173
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:41,910
Why don't you guys
take the first shift?

1174
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:43,412
Wake me up in ten hours.

1175
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:45,014
Oh, boy!

1176
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:48,017
I don't know if
I'll ever even be able
to get to sleep.

1177
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,927
God. Ugh!

1178
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:00,796
Why are we still
following him?

1179
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:02,298
He's a cashier.

1180
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,832
He's a manager, mom.

1181
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:05,301
Just stay positive.

1182
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:07,436
Feel free to drink
from any puddle you see.

1183
00:55:07,438 --> 00:55:09,071
All water in the jungle
is safe.

1184
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:11,774
You have no information.

1185
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,746
Wait.

1186
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,920
And just over this Ridge

1187
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:26,755
that's the quickest way
to Bogota.

1188
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:34,330
We're going to swing over
to the other side.

1189
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,733
One at a time.

1190
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:39,001
I'll go first

1191
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:40,402
'cause I'm the man.

1192
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:43,972
Ha-ha!

1193
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,617
Oh!

1194
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,021
Fuck! Shit!

1195
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:00,356
Okay, okay.

1196
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:02,358
Oh, my god!
This is bullshit!

1197
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,459
Okay.

1198
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:05,027
Oh, my god!

1199
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,462
Maybe he's okay.

1200
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:07,629
Okay, okay, okay.

1201
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:08,764
Okay.
Okay.

1202
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:10,032
Okay? Okay?
Okay. Okay.

1203
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,500
Okay.
Okay.

1204
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:15,971
Russell.

1205
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,040
Hello, Morgan.

1206
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:22,378
Sir, you've called
12 times today.

1207
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,647
<i> I've been in touch with</i>
<i> the us consulate in Bogota.</i>

1208
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:26,782
<i> They put out an alert</i>

1209
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:28,650
with the Colombian military
and police.

1210
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:29,952
All we can do is wait
until we hear from them.

1211
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:31,987
And I wonder what

1212
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,857
joanne would think
about this.

1213
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,660
Wait, did you say "joanne"

1214
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:41,397
like, my wife, joanne?

1215
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:42,731
Is this some kind
of a threat?

1216
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,800
No,
i didn't say joanne.

1217
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:48,003
I said "yo, Anne."
<i> No, you said "joanne"</i>

1218
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:49,805
like you've been on
my Facebook page
or something.

1219
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:52,808
<i> You called an officer</i>
<i> of the us government</i>

1220
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,543
and threatened his wife
over the phone.

1221
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:57,913
<i> so I want you to get</i>
<i> real quiet, okay?</i>

1222
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:01,683
If you call this number
one more
motherfucking time

1223
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:03,519
<i> I'm gonna show up</i>
<i> at your house,</i>

1224
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:05,821
handcuff you
to the bumper of your car

1225
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:07,456
<i> and drag you</i>
<i> to federal prison,</i>

1226
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,024
where you will
be skull raped

1227
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:10,893
<i> to within an inch</i>
<i> of your life,</i>

1228
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:12,728
<i> every single</i>
<i> fucking night!</i>

1229
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:14,196
I don't think
you're gonna enjoy that.

1230
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:16,198
Oh, yeah?
I'll come to your house,

1231
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,866
and I'll fuck your dick.

1232
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:22,771
You know what? Hold up.

1233
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,945
Yo, yo, yo!

1234
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,047
"Yo, yo, yo"?
That's racist, Jeffrey.
That's fucked up.

1235
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:33,182
"Yo, yo, yo"?

1236
00:57:33,184 --> 00:57:35,851
Yo, this is
this is Derrick.

1237
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:37,119
What's your last name,
Derrick?

1238
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,154
Black.

1239
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:40,556
<i> Now let me</i>
<i> tell you something.</i>

1240
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:42,491
That threat you made
is all fucked up.

1241
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:44,993
I'm gonna come to your house.
I got your address right here.

1242
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:28,504
Okay,
where do we go now?

1243
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:30,572
Roger said
it's just across the Ridge.

1244
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,641
Roger is dead.

1245
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:33,775
I realize that.

1246
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:35,811
Yeah, and he didn't know
anything.

1247
00:58:35,813 --> 00:58:37,279
Just use the map, mom.

1248
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:40,148
Oh, my god.

1249
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,251
This is a placemat
from a restaurant.

1250
00:58:42,253 --> 00:58:43,819
Everything will be fine.

1251
00:58:43,821 --> 00:58:46,021
Everything is not fine,
Emily Louise.

1252
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,123
Look where we are.
Look where we are.

1253
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,626
In the middle
of the Amazon!

1254
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,529
Oh, my god!

1255
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,831
That's how desperate I am
to spend time with you.

1256
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,232
I see you
all the time.

1257
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:01,136
You see me
when you
need something.

1258
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:02,237
That's not true.

1259
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:05,941
When I just say anything
just remotely critical...

1260
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:08,644
Wait!
"Remotely critical"?

1261
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:12,014
Mom, you flat-out
insult me.
All the time.

1262
00:59:12,016 --> 00:59:13,081
What?

1263
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,316
It's not a good way
to raise kids.

1264
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,253
What do you know
about raising kids?

1265
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:20,556
What do you know
about anything?

1266
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:22,558
Except posting
pictures of yourself?

1267
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,193
Okay, well, I only post
so many pictures of myself

1268
00:59:25,195 --> 00:59:27,863
because I want
people to witness me

1269
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:30,332
having an interesting,
full life

1270
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:32,734
and give me compliments
in the comments.

1271
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:35,771
You can do that without
posting pictures. I do.

1272
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:37,706
You have a full,
interesting life?

1273
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:39,741
You just check the locks
all day.

1274
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,944
And change
the kitty litter.

1275
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:44,813
You hide in your home
with your adult son.

1276
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:48,050
Are you saying that
I've wasted my life?

1277
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:50,352
I didn't say that.

1278
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:52,054
You know what?
You're wrong!

1279
00:59:52,056 --> 00:59:56,158
Because I had you.
And I had your brother.

1280
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,627
So don't you dare say
i wasted my life.

1281
00:59:58,629 --> 01:00:00,262
I gave you
everything I had.

1282
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:01,830
Everything!

1283
01:00:01,832 --> 01:00:03,832
And I did it alone!

1284
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:08,737
What the hell have you
ever done for anybody?

1285
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:10,706
For 18 years

1286
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:12,341
your mother is the most
important person

1287
01:00:12,343 --> 01:00:13,875
to you in your
entire life.

1288
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,711
And then...
And then...

1289
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:17,379
One day, poof!
You're gone.

1290
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:18,847
And then what are you
supposed to do?

1291
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:20,248
Like, just adjust?
Just like that?

1292
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:22,718
It's not possible, Emily.

1293
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,253
You were mine.

1294
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:27,089
And now, you're not.

1295
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,358
And I...

1296
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,893
I miss you.

1297
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:34,663
Mom, I'm right here.

1298
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:36,632
I'm the one who
invited you on this trip.

1299
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,233
I'm on this trip, Emily,

1300
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:41,336
because you didn't want
to drink mai tais alone.

1301
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:44,640
No! You are
the mergle fur!

1302
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:47,242
What the hell
is mergle fur?

1303
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:48,977
Oh, Emily!

1304
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,257
Oh!

1305
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:03,825
Thank god!

1306
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:07,929
Honey, we're so lucky
because I had to drag you

1307
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:10,198
all the way through
the jungle, looking for help.

1308
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,267
And I ran into Dr. Armando
and his friend.

1309
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:14,670
who I've been teaching
a little English.

1310
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:16,004
No big deal.
Go ahead.

1311
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,372
Hello.
Ah!

1312
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:19,207
Good.
That's great.

1313
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:20,809
He's been assisting me

1314
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:22,844
as I search local plants
for a compound

1315
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,680
that could potentially...
Are you ready?

1316
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:25,814
Cure cancer.

1317
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:27,349
That is amazing!

1318
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,084
I think so.
Yes, thank you.

1319
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:30,352
All right.
Well, thank you, guys.

1320
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,720
- Thanks, macho.
- You ready?

1321
01:01:31,722 --> 01:01:33,288
Yeah, we're gonna
head out of here.

1322
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,424
Oh, you can't go
just yet.

1323
01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:37,359
Um, you have
a parasite in you.

1324
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,227
What?
What's that?

1325
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:40,729
Here's the thing.
Your mother told us

1326
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:42,864
that you've been, like,
extremely hungry lately.

1327
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:44,733
And thankfully,
when you passed out

1328
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:46,234
you shat yourself.

1329
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:47,369
Thank god.

1330
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,137
Never seen so much shit.

1331
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:52,908
Like a human, almost.
Yeah.

1332
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:54,843
Okay, we understand.
It was a lot of shit.

1333
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:55,911
Lots of shit. Yes.

1334
01:01:55,913 --> 01:01:58,413
But through that, we could
take a stool sample

1335
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:01,383
and determine that
you have a tapeworm.

1336
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:02,751
A tapeworm?

1337
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:05,253
Tapeworm.

1338
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:06,922
What?
Can I look at that?

1339
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:08,990
Yes, please.
A second opinion is...
Yes.

1340
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:10,125
Please, please, please.
Go ahead.

1341
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:13,261
So what's the treatment?
Like a z-pack?

1342
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:14,930
If it's already affecting
your appetite,

1343
01:02:14,932 --> 01:02:16,498
I think it's probably...

1344
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:18,967
It's pretty significant.

1345
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:21,403
Listen.
We're out of praziquantel

1346
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:23,739
to substract it
from you manually.

1347
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:25,273
What? Manually? What?

1348
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:26,408
With my manuals.

1349
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:27,743
That's fuckin' gross.

1350
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:28,844
Good news! Right now,

1351
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:30,245
the tapeworm
is really hungry, right?

1352
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:31,513
So what we're gonna do

1353
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:33,849
is we're gonna lodge open
your throat

1354
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:36,284
and dangle a piece of meat
in front of your throat.

1355
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:37,753
Try to coax it out.

1356
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:38,887
It'll feel safe,
but it's not safe

1357
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:40,021
because I'm gonna pull it.

1358
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,156
No!
Slowly!

1359
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:43,158
Slowly! Slowly!
Then, slap it down.

1360
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,459
Slap it down. Kill it.

1361
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:48,263
It's a two-man job, ma'am.
It's a two-man job, I'm sorry.

1362
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,432
I've got a worm, mom.
I know.

1363
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:51,933
Mom!
I'm here.

1364
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,035
Get the worm out, mom.
I'm your pillar.

1365
01:02:54,037 --> 01:02:55,103
Hello.

1366
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:04,780
Oh, hello.

1367
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:10,352
When will we know
when it's working?

1368
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:13,288
When we look into
the worm's eyes, Linda.

1369
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,357
Come outside and face me.

1370
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,392
Yes. Show me your face.

1371
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,996
Oh, here it comes. Okay.

1372
01:03:20,998 --> 01:03:22,063
Okay.

1373
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:26,902
Oh. What?

1374
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:28,336
Oh, it's coming.
It's making its way.

1375
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:29,538
Okay, relax, I got this. Move.

1376
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:34,376
Knock me out!
Knock me out!

1377
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,286
What are you doing?

1378
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:45,821
Okay! Okay!

1379
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,327
Help me. Help me!

1380
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,006
It's not like at home.

1381
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:07,909
I bet.
Oh, there she comes.

1382
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:08,977
Oh, look!

1383
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:11,012
Hi.
Hi.

1384
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:13,882
Baby.
Hi.

1385
01:04:13,884 --> 01:04:14,950
Do you feel better?

1386
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,118
I feel great.

1387
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,520
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

1388
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:19,588
You did good.

1389
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,357
Hi, maco. Thank you.

1390
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,293
Emily, this is
a traditional gift

1391
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:26,428
that the village
made for you.

1392
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:28,129
It's for protection
while you're here.

1393
01:04:28,131 --> 01:04:29,865
For me?
Yes, for you.

1394
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:31,266
Oh, my god.

1395
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:33,401
That's so nice.

1396
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,136
It's heavy. It's thick.

1397
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:37,305
It's, like, hurting.
Thank you.

1398
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:38,373
It's tight.

1399
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:41,610
Something kanye
would design.

1400
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:43,545
That's great.

1401
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,451
Do they just kind of
do that all day?

1402
01:04:49,453 --> 01:04:50,619
Oh, yes.

1403
01:04:50,621 --> 01:04:52,888
When we got here,
we provided a lift.

1404
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:54,589
They used to have to walk
miles up the hill.

1405
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:56,024
But, much easier now.

1406
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:57,893
That's very
thoughtful of you.

1407
01:04:57,895 --> 01:05:01,296
They just kind of straight
chill, or...

1408
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:03,932
Culturally,
the women do the work

1409
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:05,901
and the men, they provide
the protection, you know?

1410
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:07,636
Yeah.

1411
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:10,372
That's fucked up.

1412
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:13,642
Not for the men. Yeah.

1413
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,915
That's so cool.
This is what
you guys are up to.

1414
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,585
Oh, I'm like in this now.
Okay.

1415
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:26,521
Ooh!

1416
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:32,661
Emily! The doctor said
he could get us to Bogota.

1417
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:34,262
That is amazing.

1418
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:35,463
Oh, my god!

1419
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:36,665
Okay. Do I have
a couple minutes?

1420
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:38,099
'Cause I'm
kinda helping...

1421
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:39,935
Helping out the ladies.

1422
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:46,074
Thank you.

1423
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:48,143
Come here,
you know i
got you, girl.

1424
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,413
Look at you helping.

1425
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,518
Yeah, I am helpful.

1426
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,520
Honey, you know, when
i said that, I didn't mean...

1427
01:05:58,522 --> 01:06:01,990
That I'm selfish
or that I'm worthless?

1428
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:03,191
Which part of our fight?

1429
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:05,093
Emily, come on.
I didn't mean that.

1430
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:07,462
It's fine.
I know how you see me.

1431
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:12,968
Yeah? Okay.

1432
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:15,637
Oh, god.

1433
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:17,205
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1434
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,276
Shit, shit, shit!

1435
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:22,644
There's some very bad men
looking for you.

1436
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:25,613
They've blocked the main
entrance. It's really bad.

1437
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:29,217
No, nobody's being fucked,
okay? I got an idea.

1438
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:30,986
I got an idea.
Go, I'll stall them.

1439
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:32,187
Go, go, go.
Yeah?

1440
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:47,302
Honey, get in here!

1441
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:49,237
This won't hold both of us.
I'm too heavy.

1442
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:51,673
No, you're perfect.

1443
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,408
You're just perfect.

1444
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,143
Okay, hold on tight.

1445
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:56,578
And, remember,
when you get down there,

1446
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:57,679
get to the embassy.

1447
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,681
No, mom!
I want to stay with you!

1448
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,016
Mom!

1449
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:02,317
Mom!

1450
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:03,585
Everything's gonna be okay.

1451
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,088
I love you!

1452
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:23,638
Oh.

1453
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:58,440
Hello.

1454
01:07:58,442 --> 01:08:00,275
Emily.

1455
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:02,077
Hi.
Hi.

1456
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:05,213
We were able to get
your items sent over
from the hotel.

1457
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:06,481
Any updates on my mom?

1458
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,283
Oh, I'm sorry.
There's nothing yet.

1459
01:08:08,285 --> 01:08:10,485
But we are
gonna get you

1460
01:08:10,487 --> 01:08:12,153
an escort
to the airfield base...

1461
01:08:12,155 --> 01:08:14,355
And then someone will
get you home from there.

1462
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:16,324
I'm not doing that.

1463
01:08:16,326 --> 01:08:19,094
I'm not going anywhere
without my mother.

1464
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:20,462
Can I be candid with you?

1465
01:08:20,464 --> 01:08:21,629
Yeah. What?

1466
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,465
It's my third day.

1467
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:26,201
And I guess everybody
takes off on Fridays,

1468
01:08:26,203 --> 01:08:27,335
but they didn't tell me

1469
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:30,105
because it's my third day.

1470
01:08:30,107 --> 01:08:33,108
So if you could just
take your box and go.

1471
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,375
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1472
01:08:34,377 --> 01:08:35,643
I just need to
find my mother.

1473
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:37,312
That's why I'm here.

1474
01:08:37,314 --> 01:08:39,514
The only reason my mother
even came on this trip

1475
01:08:39,516 --> 01:08:42,250
is because I made her.
Because I am selfish.

1476
01:08:42,252 --> 01:08:44,385
And I need help
finding her right now,

1477
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:46,654
and I need you to be the guy
that helps me.

1478
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:49,257
Come on, man.
Be that guy.

1479
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:50,458
Who's the guy?

1480
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,659
Not me!

1481
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:53,394
It isn't.
It's never been.

1482
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:55,763
I'd love to be the guy who
sweeps you off your feet

1483
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:57,765
and is your hero
and can save your mother

1484
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:59,501
and take care of you
and maybe we hook up.

1485
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:01,236
I don't know.
Wait, what?

1486
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:04,339
But I'm just saying
that I am not that dude.

1487
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:07,142
So I need you
to be that girl

1488
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:10,278
who just takes your box
and walks outta this office

1489
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,147
before you draw
any more attention

1490
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:13,781
to the fact that
i don't know
what I'm doing.

1491
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:15,550
Can I just use your phone?

1492
01:09:15,552 --> 01:09:18,153
Can you be the guy
that lets me use his phone?

1493
01:09:18,155 --> 01:09:20,822
Yes. See? That I can do.

1494
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:21,890
Come on.

1495
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,265
I haven't been trained
on the phone system.

1496
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:31,566
Oh, my god!

1497
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:40,642
Hello, Morgan.

1498
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:43,545
Choose your next move
carefully, brother.

1499
01:09:45,448 --> 01:09:46,915
Wait! No, no, no!

1500
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:48,316
Don't touch me.
Security!

1501
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:49,551
Purell! Put on purell!

1502
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:54,189
Fucking shit!
Let me have
my day in court.

1503
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:56,391
All right,
wait, wait, wait!

1504
01:09:56,393 --> 01:10:00,261
Morgan, I'm a middle-aged man
who never leaves the house.

1505
01:10:00,263 --> 01:10:03,331
All I have in this world
is my mama and my sister.

1506
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:05,266
And if something
happens to them

1507
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:07,569
then all I'll have
is you.

1508
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:08,937
And I'm telling you
right now

1509
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,873
I'm fucking annoying.

1510
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:14,442
I've read all
the<i> game of thrones</i> books.

1511
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:15,743
I'll text you spoilers.

1512
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:18,746
I don't
want to go to an orphanage.

1513
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:20,515
I can't be an orphan.

1514
01:10:20,517 --> 01:10:22,350
I need my mama!

1515
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:24,619
Help me find my mama!

1516
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:25,753
Thank you so much
for answering.

1517
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:26,854
I didn't know
who else to call.

1518
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:29,624
The guy I dealt with
at the embassy was insane.

1519
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:31,926
Emily, we're gonna
get you through this.

1520
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:34,529
<i> But Barb wants me</i>
<i> to let you know one thing.</i>

1521
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:37,498
She refuses to use
sexual humiliation

1522
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,400
as an interrogation
technique.

1523
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:40,635
What are you
talking about?

1524
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:44,372
I don't care what she does.
Just can you help me?

1525
01:10:44,374 --> 01:10:45,907
<i> Meet us at</i>
<i> the presidente apartments</i>

1526
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:48,409
We're trying to use
her cell signal

1527
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,646
Colombian military is
setting up
a couple stingrays

1528
01:10:51,648 --> 01:10:54,382
We can have a unit ready
to go in by tomorrow.

1529
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:55,783
Well,
we got a big problem

1530
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:57,518
'cause that unit
needed to be
there yesterday.

1531
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,388
I told you
to shut the fuck up!

1532
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:01,456
Okay.

1533
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,926
We've got reports
coming in that puts them

1534
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:06,527
about 50 miles
outside of Bogota.

1535
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:08,563
Yeah, that's
morgado territory all right.

1536
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:09,797
Who's morgado?

1537
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:12,567
Let's just say he's none
of your goddamn business.

1538
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:13,835
- Let me come with you.
- No!

1539
01:11:13,837 --> 01:11:15,536
Please!
Absolutely not!

1540
01:11:15,538 --> 01:11:17,405
I'll translate.
You speak Spanish?

1541
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:18,539
I speak dothraki.

1542
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:19,707
I speak klingon.

1543
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:20,808
You speak klingon?

1544
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:27,582
I'm coming with.
You're not going anywhere.

1545
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:29,651
I think I see them
right there.
Is that them?

1546
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:30,785
Little specks there?

1547
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,954
You know,
why don't you
wait outside.

1548
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:34,289
Go, go in the hallway.

1549
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,423
Fuck!

1550
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:36,724
Nerd. He's a nerd.

1551
01:11:37,594 --> 01:11:42,497
We have someone here I think
you're gonna want to see.

1552
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,301
James?

1553
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:49,537
Thank fuck. Emily. Listen,
you've gotta help me, please.

1554
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:51,072
We found him
sitting at the bar,

1555
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:53,441
chatting up another
pretty young girl.

1556
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:54,809
It's a scam, Emily.

1557
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:57,578
Yeah, so Barb waited
for him outside

1558
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,315
smacked him in
the back of the head,
threw him in the car

1559
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:01,749
and here we are.

1560
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:03,451
It's not a scam.
These women are crazy.

1561
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:05,320
This whole fucking thing
is insane.

1562
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:06,421
Crazy?

1563
01:12:06,423 --> 01:12:08,356
Oh, you wanna
know crazy?

1564
01:12:08,358 --> 01:12:11,025
You remember
my platonic friend, Barb?

1565
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:12,794
Oh, Barb!

1566
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:18,466
We were supposed to go
to the Arizona gem show

1567
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:21,402
but instead, I'm here,
fucking with you.

1568
01:12:21,738 --> 01:12:28,476
You should know that Barb
spent her life in special ops.

1569
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:30,478
Not that bullshit
regular ops.

1570
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,879
She's retired now

1571
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,881
so she doesn't
have her toolkit.

1572
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:36,351
But she was
able to improvise
a few things.

1573
01:12:36,353 --> 01:12:38,052
Which, I'm pretty sure,

1574
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:40,722
will all be applied
to your dick hole area.

1575
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:45,126
Esmeraldas!
She's in esmeraldas.

1576
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:46,794
It's, like,
an hour's drive from here.

1577
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:48,396
We got a real
chatty Cathy here.

1578
01:12:48,398 --> 01:12:49,964
Give me a map. I can mark it
on the map for you.

1579
01:12:49,966 --> 01:12:51,099
Write it down.

1580
01:12:51,101 --> 01:12:53,401
You want to start here...

1581
01:12:53,403 --> 01:12:55,436
Barb is really upset
about this. She had plans.

1582
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,506
Now this doesn't always
show up on waze

1583
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:01,042
but you be sure
to take that one

1584
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:02,577
because it's
the quickest route

1585
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:03,711
if you want to
avoid traffic.

1586
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,413
Okay.

1587
01:13:05,415 --> 01:13:07,382
Okay, let's go.
Listen, Emily.

1588
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:08,916
Be sure you check
all the rooms.

1589
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:10,651
She'll probably be held
on the third floor.

1590
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:15,690
Do you have any loyalty
to the people who hired you?

1591
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:18,393
Hey, Emily,
can I just say,
as well, you...

1592
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:20,561
Fuck, you look great.

1593
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,130
Thank you.
I got a tapeworm.

1594
01:13:22,132 --> 01:13:23,698
Well, it's working
for you.

1595
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,533
Hey, listen!
Are we, uh...

1596
01:13:25,535 --> 01:13:27,402
Am I ever going to
see you again?

1597
01:13:27,404 --> 01:13:28,536
Well, I don't know.

1598
01:13:28,538 --> 01:13:29,937
I guess if you're, like,
in New York,

1599
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:31,005
we could get a drink.

1600
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,476
In your wet dreams,
motherfucker.

1601
01:13:54,898 --> 01:13:56,964
Be super quiet.

1602
01:13:56,966 --> 01:13:58,933
<i> You have</i>
<i> arrived at your destination.</i>

1603
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,067
Fix it!

1604
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:04,705
Let's go get your mom.

1605
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:38,840
Just walk.
Huh?

1606
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,648
Ow!

1607
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:58,926
We're all
gonna jump down there,

1608
01:14:58,928 --> 01:14:59,994
sneak past those guys

1609
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,062
and get your mom.

1610
01:15:01,064 --> 01:15:02,129
Okay.

1611
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:00,555
Fuck, fuck, fuck

1612
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,819
oh, honey!

1613
01:16:31,821 --> 01:16:33,321
I made a shiv.

1614
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,123
You're alive.

1615
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:37,592
Oh, my god, mom.

1616
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:39,026
I'm so sorry
i got you into all of this.

1617
01:16:40,797 --> 01:16:41,862
I should have just
listened to you.

1618
01:16:41,864 --> 01:16:42,930
I should have
listened to you.

1619
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:47,868
You're always there.
If I'm sad or lonely.

1620
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:50,338
And it's 3:00
in the morning,
i call

1621
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,607
and you answer.

1622
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:54,108
You always answer.

1623
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,876
I know, I know.

1624
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:57,678
You're that person
for me, mom.

1625
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,280
Okay, honey.

1626
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:00,881
I'm so sorry.

1627
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,217
I love you.

1628
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:04,285
I love you.

1629
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:07,321
Honey, this is
a really long hug.

1630
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:09,357
Can we have just
one more second?

1631
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:11,025
I really thought
you were dead.

1632
01:17:11,027 --> 01:17:13,794
but we really got
to get the fuck
out of here.

1633
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:14,862
Okay, okay.

1634
01:17:24,841 --> 01:17:26,173
Okay, okay.

1635
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:40,721
Okay.

1636
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,692
The car's over here.

1637
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:45,926
- Oh, my god.
- Are you okay?

1638
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:47,428
No.

1639
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:53,067
Oh, my god!

1640
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:56,337
Do you have some cyanide
we could take, or something?

1641
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:58,673
Oh, my god!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1642
01:17:58,675 --> 01:18:00,141
Oh, my god!

1643
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:05,813
It doesn't hurt too much,
but roll it down.

1644
01:18:05,815 --> 01:18:06,847
No.

1645
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,282
Roll it down,<i> pendeja.</i>
No!

1646
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:09,383
Push the fucking button.

1647
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:11,285
I can't,<i> pendeja.</i>
It's broken.

1648
01:18:11,287 --> 01:18:12,420
It's broken?

1649
01:18:12,422 --> 01:18:14,021
Yeah, sorry. Goodbye.

1650
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:19,727
Hi!

1651
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:20,861
No! No! No!

1652
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,697
No! No!

1653
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:23,764
No!

1654
01:18:28,438 --> 01:18:29,737
No!

1655
01:18:29,739 --> 01:18:31,839
Now, I'm gonna kill you.

1656
01:18:31,841 --> 01:18:33,474
Don't touch my daughter!

1657
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:42,249
Don't move!

1658
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:46,987
Now what?

1659
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:48,723
Do you wanna dance?

1660
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:54,729
Yes!

1661
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,397
Nice kick,<i> malparida.</i>

1662
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:57,998
Nice kick.

1663
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,066
Now

1664
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:03,037
let me show you my dance.

1665
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:04,171
Oh, my god.

1666
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,888
Ugh! Okay.

1667
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:23,157
I beg you.
Don't shoot me.

1668
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:25,226
You fucked with
the wrong bitches.

1669
01:19:25,228 --> 01:19:26,360
Yeah, you did.

1670
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:29,330
Kill him, mom.
No. I can't.

1671
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:30,765
This is a mom thing.

1672
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:32,166
No, this isn't a mom thing.
You got this.

1673
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:33,968
- It's not what I do well.
- I don't do it well.

1674
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:35,269
You did it before.

1675
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,771
Those were accidental.

1676
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:38,205
I can't hold it anymore.

1677
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:40,040
Okay, here I go.
Go!

1678
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:41,308
I'm gonna count down,
I'm gonna do it.

1679
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,343
Please. Please.

1680
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:43,511
100...

1681
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:45,813
99...

1682
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:54,488
Oh, fuck!

1683
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:55,790
Oh, thank god!

1684
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:56,891
Come on. Kill me.

1685
01:19:56,893 --> 01:19:58,025
Now I'm getting
the confidence.

1686
01:19:58,027 --> 01:19:59,293
Give me that thing.
Oh, okay.

1687
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,195
No, I can't do that.
I just got excited.

1688
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:02,897
Don't move!

1689
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:11,272
I will kill you.

1690
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,542
Very rude!
Very rude!

1691
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:23,984
Here we go.
Moving in hot.

1692
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:26,053
This is what we trained for.
You, on the roof.

1693
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:27,488
You, on the roof.

1694
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,557
You, also on the roof.
Everyone on the roof.

1695
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:31,592
I know you're scared...

1696
01:20:31,594 --> 01:20:34,528
Again,
shut the fuck up, man!

1697
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,363
Okay?
Okay.

1698
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:37,965
Jeffrey.
What?

1699
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:39,066
Jeffrey!

1700
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:40,901
Mama...

1701
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,904
Mama! Mama!

1702
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,106
Mama!

1703
01:20:46,108 --> 01:20:47,575
Mama!

1704
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,387
I missed you.

1705
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:03,524
Oh, my god!
I'm so happy to see you.

1706
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:04,959
I left the house.

1707
01:21:04,961 --> 01:21:06,126
You left the house.

1708
01:21:06,128 --> 01:21:07,628
I made all these
men come...

1709
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:08,996
What?
Oh!

1710
01:21:08,998 --> 01:21:11,232
Here! I made them come here
to get you.

1711
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,268
I missed you!
I missed you, too!

1712
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:16,503
Hey. Agent Russell.

1713
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:18,005
Let me take
that from you.

1714
01:21:18,007 --> 01:21:19,373
Good job with morgado.

1715
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,008
We've been looking for him
for a while.

1716
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,977
Oh, my god.
He's so mean.

1717
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:25,045
Anyway, your brother
really cares about you.

1718
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,181
Mama!

1719
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:28,549
He's a real bummer.

1720
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:30,184
Oh, yeah. The worst.

1721
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:32,152
Yep. Awful.
Full agreement.

1722
01:21:32,154 --> 01:21:34,154
Morgan. Morgan!

1723
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:35,256
What?

1724
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:38,259
Thank you.

1725
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:45,165
You're the best!

1726
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:47,534
You're the best!
Thank you for your help.

1727
01:21:50,306 --> 01:21:52,273
I wanna go home
so fucking bad.

1728
01:21:52,275 --> 01:21:53,641
I'm so hungry.
I'm so hungry.

1729
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:15,629
Let's get the fuck
out of here!

1730
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:41,088
Can I have just whatever
everyone is drinking?

1731
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:42,256
Just, like,
your signature thing.

1732
01:22:42,258 --> 01:22:43,324
Yeah.

1733
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:48,696
Hi.

1734
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:50,998
Hey.

1735
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,566
What brings you
down here?

1736
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:54,268
Oh, uh...

1737
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:55,736
I'm actually
volunteering.

1738
01:22:55,738 --> 01:22:57,104
That's awesome.

1739
01:22:57,106 --> 01:22:58,672
Yeah, it's really fun.

1740
01:22:58,674 --> 01:23:00,074
Can I get you a drink?

1741
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,509
Uh...

1742
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:04,244
I'm kind of here
with somebody.

1743
01:23:04,246 --> 01:23:05,379
Oh.

1744
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:06,647
Honey!
Hi, mom!

1745
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:08,215
Oh, god,
this is so fun!

1746
01:23:08,217 --> 01:23:12,252
Okay, so anyway, I met this
fascinating woman over there.

1747
01:23:12,254 --> 01:23:13,988
And she's gonna take us
to her home

1748
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:15,689
and she's gonna teach us
how to make murtabak.

1749
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:17,691
What is that?
It's a stuffed pancake.

1750
01:23:17,693 --> 01:23:21,095
I'm gonna go make a request
because I want to dance.

1751
01:23:21,097 --> 01:23:22,229
Oh, I love you.

1752
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:23,330
I love you.

1753
01:23:26,034 --> 01:23:27,501
You're here
with your mother.

1754
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:29,236
Yeah.

1755
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:31,205
Why?

1756
