1
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,099
I never wanted a war.

2
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,604
I just wanted people
to know what happened here.

3
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:09,109
Ninety-eight men, women, children...

4
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,447
......my husband.

5
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,991
And yet no one believed.

6
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,541
They rebuilt the town.

7
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,044
Life went on.

8
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,634
But I was already dead inside.

9
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,143
I never wanted a war.

10
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,695
Good evening. I am Stella Oleson.
I am a survivor of Barrow.

11
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,658
I have been traveling
for the past 10 months...

12
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:47,703
...trying to find ways
to make people understand.

13
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,831
So l want to thank you...

14
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:55,294
...all of you, for being here tonight,
for having an open mind.

15
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,549
The story I am about to tell you
is an absolute truth.

16
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,678
It wasn't a faulty pipeline...

17
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:07,681
...that destroyed our peaceful town.

18
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,519
Ninety-eight people didn't die
in an oil fire.

19
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,269
No.

20
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,356
The truth is...

21
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,944
...last year when the sun set
for 30 days...

22
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,448
...our town, Barrow, Alaska...

23
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,788
...came under siege
by a clan of vampires.

24
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,796
That's okay.

25
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,383
People always laugh.

26
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,428
But tonight...

27
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:48,513
...tonight will be different.

28
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:54,394
See, they go to great lengths to make
you think that they don't exist...

29
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,732
...which is why every time
I do one of these things...

30
00:05:58,732 --> 00:06:01,193
...a couple of them show up.

31
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,196
Well, l have a surprise for you.

32
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,368
I have rigged the ceiling
with three SunMax ultraviolet lights...

33
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,996
...each of which are the same intensity
and wavelength...

34
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:14,748
...as the sun at high noon.

35
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,001
If there are any of you out there...

36
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:21,046
...l suggest you stand
and show yourselves.

37
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,173
Otherwise....

38
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,676
I am a vampire.

39
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,106
Hit the lights.

40
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:02,355
-Clever little show.
-Well, people need to know the truth.

41
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,941
That's a good one.

42
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:09,404
My husband, my closest friends,
I watched them die.

43
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:10,864
I understand.

44
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:13,116
And post-traumatic stress--

45
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,595
It can really mess a person up.

46
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,683
All those people tonight,
they can't deny what they saw.

47
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:44,105
But what they saw was a hoax,
right?

48
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,318
An elaborate stunt perpetrated
by a very sick woman.

49
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,739
If it was a hoax,
then why send in the FBl?

50
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,090
You're a thorn in my side,
Stella Oleson.

51
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,299
If it were up to me...

52
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:14,970
...l'd choke you with my bare hands
and bury you in the fucking desert.

53
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:25,897
Others, however, feel that would draw
too much attention.

54
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,111
Who are you?

55
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,284
The body's already
in the incinerator.

56
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,620
No one will ever believe you.

57
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,834
And in basketball...

58
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:49,879
...the Lakers took a crushing loss
to the Pistons this evening, 110 to 94.

59
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,133
Rain showers will be intermittent
throughout the evening.

60
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:56,845
-We will have relief come morning time...
-Sorry, Eben.

61
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,189
More wet weather
for Saturday evening.

62
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:11,943
Let's get more information about
that disturbance down on Figueroa.

63
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,502
Come on, give me the key.

64
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,430
No. No.

65
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,874
-Who the fuck are you?
-l am Paul.

66
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,418
That's Todd.

67
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:11,670
And that's Amber.

68
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,547
Great.
Now why the fuck are you in my room?

69
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:16,257
Dane sent us.

70
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:23,264
I lost my daughter three years ago,
up in Washington.

71
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:26,142
My mom and dad, right off our farm
outside of Tulsa.

72
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:29,396
My fiancée, New Orleans,
middle of the fucking city.

73
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:31,314
And no one believed us.

74
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:35,151
Might as well have been talking
about UFOs, Bigfoot, some shit.

75
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:40,407
Which is why, for the last two years,
we have been out there hunting them.

76
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,243
Hunting them?

77
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:44,786
Yes.

78
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,455
And we could use a fourth.

79
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,750
No, you don't hunt them.
They hunt you.

80
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,795
See? What did l tell you?

81
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,259
-Where you going?
-This is a fucking waste of time.

82
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,761
Amber. Hey.

83
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,152
Look, Stella, we know what it's like...

84
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,156
...waking up in the night...

85
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,117
...with your heart pounding.

86
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,661
We're offering you a chance
to end that...

87
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:29,330
...put those nightmares to rest.

88
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,291
You don't know me.

89
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,419
No. No, we don't know you.

90
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,505
But we know you're a survivor.

91
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,593
What was it, 30 days?

92
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,053
And you held on?

93
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:46,848
You know their strengths,
their weaknesses.

94
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,559
No one's going to believe you.

95
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,563
You're going to have to face that.

96
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,176
They found us. Found her.

97
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,887
-How many?
-Just one, so far.

98
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,722
All right.

99
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,351
-Get the door.
-Yep.

100
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,080
Son of a....

101
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,665
Fuck.

102
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,668
Yeah, take a seat.

103
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,921
Time to check out, huh?

104
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,112
The FBI agent...

105
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,365
...he wasn't one of them, but--

106
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:30,743
Yeah, man, they call them bug eaters.
Wannabes.

107
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:32,120
Fuckers are everywhere.

108
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,583
They do Lilith's bidding, and in return,
she promises them immortality.

109
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,585
Lilith, who's Lilith?

110
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,464
She's the one we're after.

111
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,050
Queen bee.

112
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,012
You really haven't done
your homework, have you?

113
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,016
I am sorry. Do you have a problem
with me or are you just always--?

114
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:55,476
I do. l am afraid
you're going to get us all killed.

115
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:58,313
Easy, A. This is what Dane wanted.

116
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,523
She's like a fucking magnet.

117
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,027
Lilith orchestrates everything.

118
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:06,112
She keeps them organized.

119
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:08,406
She keeps them secret.

120
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,992
She also keeps way off the grid.

121
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:14,996
But Dane's helped us track her here
to Los Angeles.

122
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:18,833
Yo, if we could take her out...

123
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,169
...the entire network falls apart.

124
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,886
Forty-one, what's your 20?

125
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,977
Let's check it out. Come on.

126
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:40,730
Let me get my shoe on. Shit.

127
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,112
Jesus Christ.

128
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,657
What the shit is that?

129
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:52,617
Come on, look at his hands.

130
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,454
Well, well, enjoying the view?

131
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,804
Where are we?

132
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,848
You're going to meet your friend,
Dane.

133
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,296
-Trouble?
-Little bit.

134
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:49,424
-Were you followed?
-l don't think so.

135
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:51,050
No, no way they followed us.

136
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,386
We were traveling, like,
80 miles an hour.

137
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,437
-No.
-Don't. Stella...

138
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,522
...he's not like the others.

139
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,441
Stella.

140
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,405
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

141
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,410
I imagine this must be
very unsettling.

142
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,627
My wound...

143
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,464
...was superficial...

144
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,679
...and so somehow l have managed
to hold on...

145
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,100
...all these years...

146
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:51,569
...to some semblance
of my humanity.

147
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,988
That's not possible.

148
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,574
No?

149
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,410
How do you feed?

150
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,788
Does that all the time.

151
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:45,456
Fucking disgusting.

152
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,884
Why did you start writing me letters?

153
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,389
Why did you start reading them?

154
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,392
You knew things...

155
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,311
...things other people
couldn't possibly know.

156
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:09,897
And l wanted answers.

157
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,861
You wanted revenge.

158
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,031
And the only way to get that...

159
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,914
...is with force.

160
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,506
They're old service tunnels.

161
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:38,050
An earthquake in the '70s
rendered them useless...

162
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,428
...but Lilith has carved them out
as a nest.

163
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,431
-This the only entrance?
-The rest are sealed off.

164
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:46,100
-How many uglies are we talking?
-lt's hard to say.

165
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,852
I am sure we can handle it.

166
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:51,564
Wait, you're planning on just walking
in there and killing her?

167
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,566
Yes.

168
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:55,735
We got big guns, sweetheart.

169
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:59,113
We have gone into nests like this before:
Seattle, New Orleans.

170
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:01,073
Yeah, this ain't our first picnic.

171
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:03,242
This one might be different though.

172
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:06,329
Lilith is in L.A. for a reason.

173
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:10,291
Whatever it is,
I am certain she's brought backup.

174
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,129
Well, it could be our only shot.

175
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,799
Yeah. What if she disappears?

176
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,969
Who knows how long it will be
before we find her again.

177
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,597
Use the daylight as usual.

178
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,307
Give yourselves an out.

179
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,935
If it's daylight, what about you?

180
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,437
I don't go.

181
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,064
Right.

182
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,816
-lt's the best time to do it.
-Yeah.

183
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:39,278
-lf the four of us can corner her--
-lf three of you can corner her.

184
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:41,322
I never agreed to any of this.

185
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,746
Told you.

186
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,871
Lil-- Lilith, l--

187
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,627
I-- l have detained the witnesses
from the motel.

188
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,052
I was thinking maybe it was time.

189
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:53,227
She wants to know
about the Alaskan, Stella.

190
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,730
She's--

191
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,525
I sent her packing back to Barrow.

192
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,073
She wants to know
how you can be so sure.

193
00:22:06,073 --> 00:22:07,950
How can l be so--?

194
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,037
Because I threatened her.
I scared her.

195
00:22:11,037 --> 00:22:12,872
She was afraid of me.

196
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,450
Well, what did she just--?

197
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,260
Mind if I sit?

198
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,603
May I?

199
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,315
Go ahead.

200
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,963
So, what's your plan now?

201
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,216
Going back to Barrow?

202
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,470
I can't.

203
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,434
Can't risk them following me
back there.

204
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,478
Yeah.

205
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:05,025
Home is an unfamiliar concept.

206
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,028
I haven't been home in years.

207
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,117
Your daughter.

208
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,952
What was her name?

209
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,205
Addie.

210
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,040
Adeline.

211
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,710
That's beautiful.

212
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,965
She'd have been 6 next week.

213
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:38,642
I heard the window shatter upstairs.

214
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,565
I rushed back to her room.

215
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,903
I saw him.

216
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,033
I saw him there in the window
with her.

217
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,828
He looked back at me.

218
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,251
Those black eyes...

219
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:05,669
...hollow.

220
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,594
And then she was gone.

221
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,766
Nobody believed me.

222
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,937
Not the police.

223
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,064
Not my wife.

224
00:25:25,064 --> 00:25:27,149
Ex-wife now.

225
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,569
So l kept moving...

226
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:35,282
...but always listening...

227
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,787
...for a story like mine.

228
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,083
That's how l found Todd
and Amber.

229
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,877
That's how we found you.

230
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,131
Lilith.

231
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,552
You said she orchestrates.

232
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,349
They don't make a move
without her saying so.

233
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,353
Not one move.

234
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,774
Barrow?

235
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,106
Hey, you okay?

236
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,191
Yeah.

237
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,862
Shit, man.

238
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,241
I thought we had it bad
back in Bywater.

239
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,871
A lot of desperate people.

240
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,165
It's all right, though.

241
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,376
You know, it was home.

242
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,134
Live just about anywhere when you're
with somebody you care about.

243
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,138
How about you, Stella?

244
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,060
What's it like up there in Barrow?

245
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,614
Cold.

246
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,474
It's a Marine Defender.

247
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:08,936
There are six in the mag.
You can go ahead and check.

248
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,817
Here.

249
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:16,777
Bullets only slow them down.

250
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,279
-l know.
-l guess you do.

251
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,468
Oh, shit.

252
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,262
All right?

253
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,556
Yeah, l just--

254
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,307
Fucker.

255
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,059
I am good.

256
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,730
Fucker.

257
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,110
Sorry.

258
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,090
Shit.

259
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,000
Watch your step.

260
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,081
You guys,
we never go this far from the light.

261
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,588
I am serious.
This isn't how we did it last time.

262
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:43,257
Amber.

263
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,069
You smell that?

264
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,405
Yeah.

265
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,498
Shit.

266
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,187
That's real fresh.

267
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,231
Let's be careful.

268
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,733
They could be close.

269
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,776
This isn't right.

270
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:46,028
This is a mistake.

271
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:47,654
This is not how we do things.

272
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:50,282
-We're too far from the sun.
-This is not the time.

273
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,159
-We're too fucking--
-Shut up.

274
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,745
-Do it now or we don't do it.
-We need to regroup.

275
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,747
No, this isn't how we do things.

276
00:31:56,747 --> 00:31:58,498
You're going to get us killed.

277
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,834
You know what? Fuck this.
I am going back.

278
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:02,753
Amber.

279
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,483
Die.

280
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,451
Behind you, Stella.

281
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,419
Fuck.

282
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,051
Amber.

283
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,263
Go.

284
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,099
Hold onto me.

285
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,078
Amber.

286
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,542
This way.

287
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,751
Come on, over here.

288
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,546
Go, go, go.

289
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,056
Todd, you okay?

290
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,684
Where did they get you?

291
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:42,561
What happened?
What have they done?

292
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:44,187
All right?

293
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,899
Oh, crap.

294
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,744
-lt's okay.
-Kill me.

295
00:33:58,744 --> 00:33:59,494
No.

296
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,251
Todd, you can hold on.

297
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:08,295
You can hold on, okay?

298
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:10,714
Hey, Dane held on for years.
You can too.

299
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:12,424
I can't.

300
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,468
-l can't.
-Yes, you can.

301
00:34:14,468 --> 00:34:16,470
Yes, you can. You can.

302
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,764
Hey, hey.

303
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,891
Hey, hold on.

304
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,519
Will you--? Todd?

305
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,272
I can feel myself...

306
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,399
...slipping away.

307
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,734
No.

308
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,823
Paul.

309
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:37,908
No.

310
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,660
You know how this works.

311
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:50,295
Jesus Christ.

312
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,810
I can't. l can't.

313
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,938
You don't have a choice.

314
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,444
Todd.

315
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:16,363
Do something.

316
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,116
Todd, I am not going to do it.

317
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:21,034
I am not doing it.

318
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,789
Look at me.

319
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,212
I am your friend, Todd.

320
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,339
I know you.

321
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,216
Fight it, Todd.

322
00:35:36,216 --> 00:35:37,296
Fight it.

323
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,766
I thought you said you have done this
before.

324
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,603
Never one of our own.

325
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:31,688
Yeah, well, get used to that.

326
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:35,609
What are we going to do?
How are we going to get out of here?

327
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,445
Fight our way out.

328
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:40,447
How are we going to do that?

329
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,200
We're low on ammo.
We're down a man.

330
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,620
Well, what do you suggest?

331
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,497
We wait.

332
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,127
Until dark,
until they go out and hunt.

333
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:56,004
No, fuck that.

334
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:59,299
Fuck that. l can't stay in here.

335
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,384
I can't.

336
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:05,555
Can you try not to lose your shit
and get another one of us killed?

337
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,518
What?

338
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,315
-What the fuck?
-Amber.

339
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,110
What the fuck did you just say?

340
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,989
You think this is my fault?

341
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,617
You think this was my fault.

342
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:27,827
That what you think?

343
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:31,498
Well, fuck you. Everything was fine
until you showed up.

344
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,005
You'd be doing me a favor.

345
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,438
Fuck.

346
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,464
We will wait till dark.

347
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,086
Are they still out there?

348
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,422
I don't see them.

349
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,514
Wait, Paul.
What the fuck are you do--?

350
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,020
Come on. They have gone to feed.

351
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,397
Nice of you to join us.

352
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:21,483
I found a way out.

353
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,941
What the fuck are you doing?
Just kill it.

354
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,116
Where's Lilith?

355
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,627
I don't think he heard you.

356
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,838
Did you not hear me?

357
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,266
Where is Lilith?

358
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,419
I told you.

359
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,213
He will die before he gives her up.

360
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,635
No, please.

361
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:13,385
No.

362
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,556
Let me go.

363
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,685
Please.

364
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,985
We didn't see nothing.

365
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:31,746
Open your mouth.

366
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,452
Fuck you.

367
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,498
Leave him alone.

368
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:42,248
No.

369
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,759
Leave him alone.

370
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,385
Please.

371
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,428
No.

372
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,850
Please.

373
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,197
What the fuck, you sick bitch?

374
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,837
You want to get out of here...

375
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,716
...tell me something useful.

376
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:43,101
There will be another feast soon.
Where the sun doesn't rise.

377
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,728
How's that for useful?

378
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,279
Tell me what town.

379
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:00,243
Only the queen knows.

380
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:18,303
They're planning another siege
during the darkness.

381
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,765
Sun sets in three days.

382
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,026
Don't.

383
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,778
Let him go.

384
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,116
You can use him.

385
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,958
Slow. Slow down or they will hear us.

386
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,086
There. There he is.

387
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,130
How many you think are in there?

388
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:38,633
I don't know. Could be lots.

389
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,390
Hey, what do you keep
in that bag of yours?

390
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,266
Just 12 pounds of C-4.

391
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,937
Good,
then we will wait till the sun's up.

392
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,278
What--?

393
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,833
--the weather.
There's a bit of sunshine--

394
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:14,335
Temperatures rising into 70s
for the afternoon...

395
00:45:14,335 --> 00:45:17,630
...but we can expect to see some more
of those rain showers...

396
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:20,925
...by evening time as another front
moves in from the south.

397
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:23,761
Outlook for the week continues
to be rather gloomy.

398
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:25,346
Temperatures cooling down....

399
00:45:25,346 --> 00:45:28,015
So, what do you do
when all this is done?

400
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:32,103
So if you were planning on going to
the beach anytime soon you might--

401
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,777
I used to feel like finding Lilith
was my endgame.

402
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,283
Like it was the last of my business.

403
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,997
Once we got it done, if I survived...

404
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,167
...l was going to finally go home...

405
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,795
...put on my robe...

406
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,840
...sit on my porch...

407
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,302
...brew myself up
a nice cup of coffee...

408
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,347
...drink it while the sun come up...

409
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,852
...then blow my fucking brains out.

410
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,442
But l don't think like that anymore.

411
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,821
What do you think like now?

412
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,369
Like l want to put this all behind me.

413
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,873
Start over.

414
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,725
They won't come out
if we're near the light.

415
00:46:52,725 --> 00:46:55,186
Then we will go where it's darker.

416
00:46:55,186 --> 00:46:57,647
Yeah, well, it won't be dark for long.

417
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,133
Guys.

418
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,267
Shit.

419
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,291
Are they dead?

420
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,473
-lt's okay.
-Help me, please. Get me out of here.

421
00:48:14,473 --> 00:48:16,392
Calm down. We're going to help you.

422
00:48:16,392 --> 00:48:18,436
Hold still.

423
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,105
-lt's okay. l know.
-Please.

424
00:48:21,105 --> 00:48:22,481
You got to be quiet now.

425
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,401
What's your name?
Tell me your name, sweetheart.

426
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:27,320
-Jennifer. Oh, my God.
-Jennifer.

427
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:32,950
We're going to get you out. It's okay.
Can you tell me where they are, huh?

428
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,494
They're everywhere.

429
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:07,610
-Where's the detonator?
-l don't know.

430
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,487
It's gone.

431
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,782
We're fucked.

432
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,715
Stay behind me.

433
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,053
There's too many.

434
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,808
Stella.

435
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,447
Oh, fuck.

436
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,954
Fucking thumb.

437
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:47,376
-You all right?
-Yeah, I am fine.

438
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,881
Be careful. Here, watch your step.

439
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,469
Was she here?

440
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,972
I don't know.

441
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,434
Let's go.

442
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,253
You're okay.

443
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,520
I got you.

444
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,231
You're okay.

445
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,691
It's going to be all right.

446
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,531
You're safe now.

447
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,664
Okay, ready? On three.

448
00:52:06,664 --> 00:52:08,374
One.

449
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,626
Fuck.

450
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,049
Shit.

451
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,057
Easy, easy, easy.

452
00:52:25,057 --> 00:52:28,227
Joint's going to be pretty weak.
Could slip out.

453
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,403
-Thanks.
-Okay.

454
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,413
I can do it.

455
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,916
It's okay. I got it.

456
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,188
Where's the girl?

457
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:15,232
Jennifer? She's sleeping.

458
00:53:15,232 --> 00:53:17,443
We need to find out what she knows.

459
00:53:17,443 --> 00:53:20,946
Yeah, well, she can barely
put two sentences together...

460
00:53:20,946 --> 00:53:24,450
...so let's give her a minute.

461
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,746
All right.

462
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,373
All set.

463
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:56,190
I haven't felt anything
in a long time...

464
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:03,155
...except anger.

465
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:08,452
And that's gotten me this far.

466
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,514
It's Dane.

467
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,308
He's helping them.

468
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,812
I have been trailing them.

469
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,274
I know where they're hiding.

470
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,985
Take care of it.

471
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,339
I am running out of time.

472
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,468
I want this.

473
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:12,851
Please.

474
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,155
Show me.

475
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,069
Oh, God. Leave me alone.

476
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,742
Leave me alone.

477
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,245
Oh, God.

478
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,248
You fucking--

479
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,589
They brought us on a ship...

480
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,843
...with bodies.

481
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,513
So many.

482
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:05,601
Some of us they took ashore...

483
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,646
...to keep bleeding us.

484
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,192
And Lilith, was she on the ship?

485
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,365
I think.

486
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,368
I don't know. They--

487
01:00:23,368 --> 01:00:27,205
Come on, Jennifer.
I need you to remember. Does sh--?

488
01:00:27,205 --> 01:00:29,958
Maybe don't push too hard, huh?

489
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:42,429
Can you try to remember?

490
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,516
Does Lilith stay on the ship?

491
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,731
I think so.

492
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,609
Do you remember where it was?

493
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,570
I saw army boats.

494
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,867
Would you recognize it, the ship?

495
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,352
Dane.

496
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,440
-Take her out back.
-Okay. Come on.

497
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,526
Come on. Out the back.

498
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,783
Come on. Come on.

499
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,619
Go, go, go.

500
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,125
Go, go, go.

501
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,627
What the fuck was that?

502
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,804
-ls he following us?
-l don't think so.

503
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,896
Do you see it?

504
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,442
There. Over there.

505
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,800
When we get out of here...

506
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,845
...l want you to take this car
and go, okay?

507
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:35,268
Stella...

508
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,814
...we don't even have a plan for this.

509
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,900
We could call the Coast Guard.

510
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,902
And tell them what?

511
01:03:43,902 --> 01:03:46,822
There's a ship full of vampires?

512
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:51,576
We're going to get on that thing
and stop it from leaving.

513
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,210
And you know it's suicide, right?

514
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,757
Let's go.

515
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,911
What the hell are they doing?

516
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:02,082
Is that--? Is that blood?

517
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,238
They can come back.

518
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:40,203
If they still have their head.

519
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,087
What was that?

520
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,466
-lt's moving.
-lt's happening.

521
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,301
They're leaving.

522
01:07:36,301 --> 01:07:40,513
Wait, wait, wait.
We cannot be stuck on this ship.

523
01:07:40,513 --> 01:07:42,557
We will not make it.

524
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,350
We don't have a choice.

525
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:46,603
Yes, we fucking do have a choice.

526
01:07:46,603 --> 01:07:50,148
We could-- We could run back now
and we could swim for it.

527
01:07:50,148 --> 01:07:52,108
Then what?

528
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:56,404
This ship gets to the Arctic Circle,
hundreds more will die.

529
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,159
Paul?

530
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,171
I am sorry.

531
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:20,970
Fuck it.

532
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:34,192
Here.

533
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,113
Navigation room.

534
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,783
-ls that up?
-lt's one level up, three sectors over.

535
01:08:41,783 --> 01:08:43,910
Through the mess hall.

536
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,703
Okay.

537
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,716
Oh, God.

538
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:43,781
Kill me.

539
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:54,749
Amber. Hey.

540
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:45,174
Turn.

541
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:53,224
Who the fuck are you?

542
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,728
-l....
-Where's the ship headed?

543
01:11:57,146 --> 01:12:00,398
Alaska. Town called Wainwright.

544
01:12:00,398 --> 01:12:01,899
Turn it around.

545
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,069
I can't.

546
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,905
-l can't. l am sorry.
-Don't say sorry.

547
01:12:07,905 --> 01:12:11,075
-Just turn it the fuck around.
-l'd do like she says, pal.

548
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:13,119
Please.

549
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:16,873
They have my family. They said--

550
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,252
Said they'd do terrible things.
They don't tell me anything.

551
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:27,967
No.

552
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:36,196
Amber.

553
01:12:57,956 --> 01:12:59,123
Do it.

554
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,312
Paul.

555
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:25,316
-How many bullets you got?
-Not enough.

556
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:31,823
-Use them on ourselves?
-l was thinking the same thing.

557
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,237
Bleed them out.

558
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,864
You get to watch first.

559
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,076
No. Don't do this.

560
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,199
No. Fuck.

561
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,652
Okay. Hold still. Let me see.

562
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:03,826
Oh, God. Okay.

563
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,706
It's going to be okay.

564
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,298
I need to stop the ship.

565
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:39,612
Do you have any idea
how this shit works?

566
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:45,535
No.

567
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,649
I think that did something.

568
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,362
Paul.

569
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:24,740
No.

570
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,466
Stella.

571
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:56,147
Does it feel like it did in Barrow?

572
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,236
When you held your dear Eben?

573
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:07,825
Felt him die in your arms?

574
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:34,483
Stella.

575
01:20:30,152 --> 01:20:31,652
Stella.

576
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:34,578
I can smell you.

577
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:37,957
I can smell your blood.

578
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,532
I felt nothing.

579
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:23,580
I could have let the ship go--

580
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:26,583
Parliament 454, do you read?

581
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:29,086
--and drift into endless darkness.

582
01:23:29,086 --> 01:23:32,339
Parliament 454, this is Z-E
Steven Rome, U.S. Coast Guard.

583
01:23:32,339 --> 01:23:34,049
Can you verify your location?

584
01:23:34,049 --> 01:23:36,427
Myself along with it.

585
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:42,016
Parliament 454, did you receive
mass text transmission?

586
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,018
Please respond.

587
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:49,064
Parliament 454, please respond.
U.S. Coast Guard, Z-E Steven Rome.

588
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:51,817
Do you copy?

589
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:55,487
Parliament 454,
can you verify your location?

590
01:23:55,487 --> 01:23:58,365
Z-E Steven Rome,
U.S. Coast Guard.

591
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:05,289
What they found on that ship...

592
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,959
...it was never on the news.

593
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:12,755
No one ever talked about it.

594
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:25,309
I thought about searching
for more people with stories like mine.

595
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,731
But I already knew one.

596
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:12,541
Come on.

597
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:45,449
Please, please, please.

598
01:26:45,449 --> 01:26:46,289
Please.

599
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:52,289
No.

600
01:28:39,772 --> 01:28:41,440
Eben.

601
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:46,445
I can't believe it's you.

602
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,448
I can't leave you.
