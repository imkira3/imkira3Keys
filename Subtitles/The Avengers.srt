1
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,461
<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

2
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:32,457
<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

3
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:38,255
It is on a little world, a human world.

4
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,302
They would wield its power,

5
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:48,351
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.

6
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:52,981
<i>He is ready to lead</i>

7
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:58,613
<i>and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.</i>

8
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:02,614
<i>A world will be his.</i>

9
00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:05,947
<i>The universe, yours.</i>

10
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:12,036
<i>And the humans,
what can they do but burn?</i>

11
00:01:26,268 --> 00:01:27,347
<i>All personnel,</i>

12
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,808
<i>the evacuation order
has been confirmed.</i>

13
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,180
How bad is it?

14
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,675
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

15
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:13,189
Dr Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

16
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:15,190
NASA didn't authorise Selvig
to go to test phase.

17
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,560
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

18
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:18,775
Spontaneous event.

19
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:20,062
It just turned itself on?

20
00:02:20,282 --> 00:02:21,313
Where are the energy levels now?

21
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,692
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

22
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,109
How long to get everyone out?

23
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,658
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

24
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:28,117
Do better.

25
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,039
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

26
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,626
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

27
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:35,043
If we can't control
the Tesseract's energy,

28
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,581
there may not be
a minimum safe distance.

29
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:38,748
I need you to make sure

30
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:40,544
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,759
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

32
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:44,680
Until such time as the world ends,

33
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:46,847
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

34
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,186
Clear out the tech below.

35
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:51,887
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

36
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:53,186
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:54,771
With me.

38
00:02:57,862 --> 00:02:58,858
Talk to me, Doctor.

39
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:02,032
Director.

40
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:03,902
Is there anything we know for certain?

41
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,360
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

42
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:09,367
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

43
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:13,082
The Tesseract is not only
active, she's behaving.

44
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:14,291
I assume you pulled the plug.

45
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:16,213
She's an energy source.

46
00:03:16,423 --> 00:03:19,460
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

47
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:20,756
If she reaches peak level...

48
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,385
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

49
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:25,973
But we don't have the harness.

50
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,380
My calculations are far from complete.

51
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:30,473
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

52
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,396
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

53
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:35,142
That can be harmful.

54
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:36,770
Where's Agent Barton?

55
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:38,652
The Hawk?

56
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,570
Up in his nest, as usual.

57
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:44,826
<i>Agent Barton, report.</i>

58
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:46,866
<i>I gave you this detail</i>

59
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:48,574
<i>so you could keep
a close eye on things.</i>

60
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,166
Well, I see better from a distance.

61
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,332
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

62
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:54,917
Doctor, it's spiking again.

63
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:56,505
No one's come or gone.

64
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,339
And Selvig's clean.

65
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,839
No contacts, no IMs.

66
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:03,136
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

67
00:04:05,057 --> 00:04:06,432
"At this end"?

68
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:10,474
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to
the other end of space, right?

69
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:13,595
Doors open from both sides.

70
00:04:14,358 --> 00:04:15,687
Not yet.

71
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:26,716
Sir, please put down the spear.

72
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:07,218
You have heart.

73
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,291
Please don't.

74
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:42,290
I still need that.

75
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,969
This doesn't have to get any messier.

76
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:45,377
Of course it does.

77
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:47,471
I've come too far for anything else.

78
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:52,222
I am Loki, of Asgard

79
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:55,310
and I am burdened with
glorious purpose.

80
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:56,935
Loki,

81
00:06:57,443 --> 00:06:58,723
brother of Thor.

82
00:06:58,945 --> 00:07:01,399
We have no quarrel with your people.

83
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:04,567
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

84
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,819
Are you planning to step on us?

85
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:10,245
I come with glad tidings

86
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,408
of a world made free.

87
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:14,789
Free from what?

88
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,331
Freedom.

89
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,501
Freedom is life's great lie.

90
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:23,132
Once you accept that, in your heart,

91
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:29,514
you will know peace.

92
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:32,265
Yeah, you say "peace,"

93
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:34,305
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

94
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:37,013
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

95
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,562
This place is about to blow

96
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:40,401
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

97
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:42,936
He means to bury us.

98
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:44,271
Like the pharaohs of old.

99
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:46,448
He's right. The portal
is collapsing in on itself.

100
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,867
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

101
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:50,242
Well, then.

102
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:07,092
I need these vehicles.

103
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:13,308
- Who's that?
- They didn't tell me.

104
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:17,769
<i>Hill!</i>

105
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:19,473
Do you copy?

106
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,523
<i>Barton has turned.</i>

107
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:37,420
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

108
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:16,040
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

109
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,642
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.

110
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:07,944
<i>Director?</i>

111
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:09,778
Director Fury, do you copy?

112
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:12,283
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

113
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,946
I have men down. Hill?

114
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:17,165
A lot of men still under.

115
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,085
I don't know how many survivors.

116
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:20,459
<i>Sound a general call.</i>

117
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:22,380
I want every living soul
not working rescue

118
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:23,504
looking for that briefcase.

119
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:24,749
Roger that.

120
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:28,254
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a Level Seven.

121
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:30,926
<i>As of right now,</i>

122
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:32,600
we are at war.

123
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:35,591
What do we do?

124
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:16,177
This is not how I wanted this evening
to go.

125
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:17,938
I know how you wanted this evening
to go.

126
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:19,228
Believe me

127
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:20,389
this is better.

128
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,234
Who are you working for?

129
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:25,190
Lermentov, yes?

130
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:28,616
Does he think

131
00:12:29,243 --> 00:12:31,034
we have to go through him

132
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:32,787
to move our cargo?

133
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:38,583
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

134
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,877
Solohob

135
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:43,128
a bagman, a front.

136
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:49,757
Your outdated information betrays you.

137
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,100
The famous Black Widow

138
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,147
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

139
00:13:01,026 --> 00:13:04,192
You really think I'm pretty?

140
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,982
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

141
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:12,867
to move the tanks.

142
00:13:13,831 --> 00:13:16,452
Tell him he is out.

143
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:18,500
Well...

144
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,123
...you may have to write it down.

145
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:33,558
It's for her.

146
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:38,302
You listen carefully

147
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:41,013
<i>You're at 1- 14
Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.</i>

148
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:43,399
<i>We have an F-22
exactly eight miles out.</i>

149
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,236
<i>Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block</i>

150
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:48,487
<i>before you can make the lobby.</i>

151
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:57,079
<i>- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding? I'm working.</i>

152
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:58,572
<i>This takes precedence.</i>

153
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:00,418
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

154
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:02,379
This moron is giving me everything.

155
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:05,419
I don't give everything.

156
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:08,219
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

157
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:09,341
<i>Natasha...</i>

158
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:12,426
Barton's been compromised.

159
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:17,471
Let me put you on hold.

160
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,227
Where is Barton now?

161
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,893
<i>- We don't know.
- But he's alive?</i>

162
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,896
We think so. I'll brief you on
everything when you get back.

163
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,194
But first, we need you to
talk to the big guy.

164
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,490
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.

165
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,200
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

166
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,934
Who are you?

167
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,477
Get out!

168
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,099
There is sickness here!

169
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,231
You're a doctor.

170
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,227
My father's not waking up!

171
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,192
He has a fever and he's moaning

172
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,405
but his eyes won't open.

173
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,531
Slow down.

174
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,159
My father...

175
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,537
Like them?

176
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,791
Please.

177
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:33,281
You should've got paid
up front, Banner.

178
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:34,775
You know, for a man

179
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:36,193
who's supposed to be avoiding stress

180
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:39,665
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

181
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,626
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

182
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,330
Then what is it? Yoga?

183
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:50,676
You brought me to the edge of
the city. Smart.

184
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:55,308
I assume the whole place
is surrounded.

185
00:16:55,768 --> 00:16:57,143
Just you and me.

186
00:16:58,395 --> 00:17:00,435
And your actress buddy?

187
00:17:00,647 --> 00:17:02,605
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

188
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:04,270
I did.

189
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:05,516
Who are you?

190
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:06,851
Natasha Romanoff.

191
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,528
Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?

192
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:14,448
Because that's not going to
work out for everyone.

193
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:17,118
No, of course not. I'm here
on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

194
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,369
S.H.I.E.L.D.

195
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,165
How did they find me?

196
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:24,962
We never lost you, Doctor.

197
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:26,168
We've kept our distance.

198
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:28,174
Even helped keep some other
interested parties

199
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:29,374
off your scent.

200
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:30,882
Why?

201
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:33,384
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

202
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:35,223
But now we need you to come in.

203
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:38,058
What if I say no?

204
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,393
I'll persuade you.

205
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:46,854
And what if the other guy says no?

206
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:49,196
You've been more than a year
without an incident.

207
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:51,979
I don't think you want to
break that streak.

208
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:56,824
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

209
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:00,080
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

210
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:04,038
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

211
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,420
This

212
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:09,005
is the Tesseract.

213
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:12,006
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

214
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,008
What does Fury want me to do,
swallow it?

215
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,682
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

216
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:24,685
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

217
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:27,819
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

218
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:30,817
If there was, that's where I'd be.

219
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:33,567
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

220
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,031
Not that he's told me.

221
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:37,404
And he tells you everything?

222
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:39,457
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

223
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,615
He needs me in a cage?

224
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:41,747
No one's going to put you in a...

225
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,915
Stop lying to me!

226
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:49,754
I'm sorry. That was mean.

227
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,878
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

228
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:57,052
Why don't we do this the easy way

229
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:58,513
where you don't use that

230
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:02,642
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

231
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:04,722
Okay?

232
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:07,064
Natasha?

233
00:19:12,742 --> 00:19:13,773
Stand down.

234
00:19:14,744 --> 00:19:16,286
<i>We're good here.</i>

235
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:19,665
"Just you and me."

236
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:24,408
<i>This is out of line, Director.</i>

237
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:27,037
<i>You're dealing
with forces you can't control.</i>

238
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,917
You ever been in a war,
Councilman? In a firefight?

239
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,924
Did you feel
an overabundance of control?

240
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,509
<i>You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?</i>

241
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,264
Not Asgard. Loki.

242
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,266
<i>He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?</i>

243
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:44,430
<i>His brother.</i>

244
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:46,606
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile

245
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:47,815
but he's worlds away.

246
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,778
We can't depend on him to help, either.

247
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:50,901
It's up to us.

248
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:53,653
<i>Which is why you
should be focusing on Phase 2.</i>

249
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,107
<i>It was designed for exactly this...</i>

250
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,495
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

251
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:00,290
We need a response team.

252
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,789
<i>The Avengers Initiative was shut down.</i>

253
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:04,794
This isn't about the Avengers.

254
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,119
<i>We've seen the list.</i>

255
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,545
<i>You're running the world's greatest
covert security network</i>

256
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,299
<i>and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race</i>

257
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:11,713
<i>to a handful of freaks.</i>

258
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:13,754
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

259
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:16,178
We need a response team.

260
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:19,138
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even

261
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:23,516
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

262
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:25,096
<i>You believe?</i>

263
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:28,900
<i>War isn't won by sentiment, Director.</i>

264
00:20:29,613 --> 00:20:32,946
No, it's won by soldiers.

265
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:54,387
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

266
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:56,140
<i>I got to put her in the water!</i>

267
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,552
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

268
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:04,642
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

269
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:06,270
<i>This guy is still alive!</i>

270
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:32,795
Trouble sleeping?

271
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:36,807
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

272
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:42,265
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

273
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:50,946
When I went under,
the world was at war.

274
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:52,983
I wake up, they say we won.

275
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:55,242
They didn't say what we lost.

276
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:58,152
We've made some mistakes
along the way.

277
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:00,240
Some, very recently.

278
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:02,989
Are you here with a mission, sir?

279
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:04,122
I am.

280
00:22:04,252 --> 00:22:05,912
Trying to get me back in the world?

281
00:22:06,421 --> 00:22:08,081
Trying to save it.

282
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:14,754
HYDRA's secret weapon.

283
00:22:14,972 --> 00:22:17,048
Howard Stark fished that
out of the ocean

284
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:18,297
when he was looking for you.

285
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:20,511
He thought what we think.

286
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:24,897
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

287
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:29,189
That's something
the world sorely needs.

288
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:31,859
Who took it from you?

289
00:22:32,073 --> 00:22:33,483
He's called Loki.

290
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:36,321
He's not from around here.

291
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:38,862
There's a lot we'll have to
bring you up to speed on

292
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:40,195
if you're in.

293
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:43,164
The world has gotten even stranger

294
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:44,372
than you already know.

295
00:22:44,878 --> 00:22:47,452
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

296
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:49,749
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

297
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:52,884
There's a debriefing packet

298
00:22:53,011 --> 00:22:55,383
waiting for you back at your apartment.

299
00:22:57,766 --> 00:22:59,675
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

300
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,008
that we ought to know now?

301
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:03,600
You should have left it in the ocean.

302
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:39,218
<i>Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.</i>

303
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:40,763
<i>You disconnected
the transmission lines?</i>

304
00:23:40,894 --> 00:23:41,889
<i>Are we off the grid?</i>

305
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:44,178
Stark Tower is about to become
a beacon

306
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:45,814
of self-sustaining clean energy.

307
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,980
<i>Well, assuming
the arc reactor takes over</i>

308
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:49,307
<i>and it actually works.</i>

309
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:50,975
<i>I assume.</i>

310
00:23:51,488 --> 00:23:52,484
Light her up.

311
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,032
<i>How does it look?</i>

312
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,874
Like Christmas, but with more me.

313
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:03,826
<i>We've got to go wider on
the public awareness campaign.</i>

314
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,074
<i>You need to do some press.</i>

315
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:06,707
<i>I'm in DC tomorrow,</i>

316
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,373
<i>I'm working on the zoning
for the next three buildings.</i>

317
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:10,753
<i>Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?</i>

318
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:11,997
<i>Enjoy the moment.</i>

319
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:13,380
<i>Get in here and I will.</i>

320
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:19,640
<i>Sir, Agent Coulson of
S.H.I.E.L.D. Is on the line.</i>

321
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:21,222
<i>I'm not in.</i>

322
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,175
I'm actually out.

323
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:33,025
<i>Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.</i>

324
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,991
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

325
00:24:40,538 --> 00:24:43,492
Levels are holding steady, I think.

326
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,867
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

327
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:47,248
Which brings me to my next question.

328
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,378
How does it feel to be a genius?

329
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,831
Well, I really wouldn't know,
now would I?

330
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:56,547
What do you mean?
All this came from you.

331
00:24:56,764 --> 00:25:00,382
No, all this came from that.

332
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,890
Give yourself some credit. Please.

333
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:04,894
Stark Tower is your baby.

334
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:07,477
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

335
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:09,056
12%?

336
00:25:09,193 --> 00:25:10,307
An argument can be made for 15.

337
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:12,022
12%? My baby?

338
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:13,815
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

339
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:15,822
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

340
00:25:16,075 --> 00:25:18,317
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

341
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:19,911
That was on you.

342
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,155
- My private elevator...
- You mean our elevator?

343
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:25,043
...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.

344
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:27,577
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

345
00:25:27,796 --> 00:25:29,753
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

346
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:31,412
It's not going to be that subtle.

347
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:32,913
I'll tell you what.

348
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:35,590
The next building is gonna
say "Potts" on the tower.

349
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:37,179
On the lease.

350
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:40,221
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

351
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:41,678
<i>Sir, the telephone.</i>

352
00:25:41,893 --> 00:25:44,266
<i>I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.</i>

353
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,437
<i>Mr Stark, we need to talk.</i>

354
00:25:46,732 --> 00:25:49,057
You have reached the life
model decoy of Tony Stark.

355
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:51,275
<i>- Please leave a message.
- This is urgent.</i>

356
00:25:51,487 --> 00:25:53,278
Then leave it urgently.

357
00:25:54,824 --> 00:25:55,938
Security breach. It's on you.

358
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,862
- Mr Stark.
- Phil! Come in.

359
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:00,031
"Phil"?

360
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:01,193
I can't stay.

361
00:26:01,413 --> 00:26:02,611
His first name is "Agent."

362
00:26:02,831 --> 00:26:04,456
Come on in. We're celebrating.

363
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,458
Which is why he can't stay.

364
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:08,626
We need you to look this over
as soon as possible.

365
00:26:08,838 --> 00:26:09,869
I don't like being handed things.

366
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:11,548
That's fine, because
I love to be handed things.

367
00:26:11,757 --> 00:26:13,086
So, let's trade.

368
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:15,963
Thank you.

369
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,386
Official consulting hours
are between 8 and 5

370
00:26:19,516 --> 00:26:20,512
every other Thursday.

371
00:26:20,684 --> 00:26:21,680
This isn't a consultation.

372
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,055
Is this about the Avengers?

373
00:26:23,478 --> 00:26:25,304
Which I know nothing about.

374
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,059
The Avengers Initiative
was scrapped, I thought.

375
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:29,650
And I didn't even qualify.

376
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:30,855
I didn't know that either.

377
00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:33,898
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

378
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,275
don't play well with others.

379
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:36,569
That I did know.

380
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,324
This isn't about personality
profiles any more.

381
00:26:38,493 --> 00:26:40,819
Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?

382
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:42,034
Half a mo.

383
00:26:47,336 --> 00:26:49,662
You know, I thought we were
having a moment.

384
00:26:49,881 --> 00:26:51,457
I was having 12% of a moment.

385
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:55,130
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

386
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:57,301
How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?

387
00:26:57,513 --> 00:26:59,256
What is all this?

388
00:26:59,473 --> 00:27:01,015
This is

389
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:02,721
this.

390
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:11,443
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

391
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:12,601
Tomorrow.

392
00:27:12,737 --> 00:27:15,026
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

393
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,948
Well, what if I didn't?

394
00:27:17,576 --> 00:27:18,950
- Lf you didn't?
- Yeah.

395
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,318
You mean when you've finished?

396
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:25,699
Well, then...

397
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:32,203
Square deal. Fly safe.

398
00:27:36,428 --> 00:27:37,543
Work hard.

399
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:42,176
So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

400
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:45,145
- I can drop you.
- Fantastic.

401
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:46,266
I want to hear

402
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:48,056
about the cellist. Is that still a thing?

403
00:27:48,273 --> 00:27:49,388
She moved back to Portland.

404
00:27:49,608 --> 00:27:52,728
What? Boo!

405
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:03,194
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

406
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,583
So, this Dr Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

407
00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:12,340
A lot of people were.

408
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:14,173
You were the world's first superhero.

409
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:17,589
Banner thought gamma radiation
might hold the key to unlocking

410
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,091
Erskine's original formula.

411
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,515
Didn't really go his way, did it?

412
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,392
Not so much.

413
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:26,437
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

414
00:28:28,482 --> 00:28:31,020
He's like a smart person.

415
00:28:33,153 --> 00:28:34,268
I gotta say,

416
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:37,021
it's an honour to meet you officially.

417
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,278
I've sort of met you. I mean,

418
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:41,242
I watched you while you were sleeping.

419
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,286
I mean, I was present

420
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:48,785
while you were
unconscious from the ice.

421
00:28:49,003 --> 00:28:51,292
You know, it's really just a huge honour

422
00:28:51,422 --> 00:28:53,379
to have you on board this...

423
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:55,632
I hope I'm the man for the job.

424
00:28:55,843 --> 00:28:58,714
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

425
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,801
We made some modifications
to the uniform.

426
00:29:02,017 --> 00:29:03,511
I had a little design input.

427
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:04,972
The uniform?

428
00:29:05,187 --> 00:29:07,677
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

429
00:29:08,856 --> 00:29:10,185
old-fashioned?

430
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:13,184
With everything that's happening

431
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:15,027
and the things that are about
to come to light,

432
00:29:15,905 --> 00:29:19,357
people might just need
a little old-fashioned.

433
00:29:51,901 --> 00:29:54,855
The Chitauri grow restless.

434
00:29:55,071 --> 00:29:56,779
Let them gird themselves.

435
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:58,698
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

436
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:00,071
Battle?

437
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,994
Against the meagre might of Earth?

438
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:07,040
Glorious, not lengthy.

439
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,034
If your force
is as formidable as you claim.

440
00:30:11,254 --> 00:30:13,745
You question us?

441
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:16,089
You question him,

442
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,715
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

443
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:21,847
Who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose

444
00:30:22,057 --> 00:30:24,928
when you were cast out, defeated?

445
00:30:25,144 --> 00:30:27,018
I was a king!

446
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,435
The rightful king of Asgard,

447
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,936
betrayed.

448
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:34,230
Your ambition is little

449
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:37,197
and born of childish need.

450
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:39,399
We look beyond the Earth

451
00:30:39,617 --> 00:30:42,571
to the greater worlds
the Tesseract will unveil.

452
00:30:43,037 --> 00:30:44,448
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

453
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,246
I don't threaten.

454
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:52,368
But until I open the doors,

455
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:56,206
until your force is mine to command,

456
00:30:56,968 --> 00:30:58,759
you are but words.

457
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,920
You will have your war, Asgardian.

458
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:06,719
If you fail,

459
00:31:07,729 --> 00:31:12,107
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

460
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:16,695
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

461
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:20,191
no crevice where he cannot find you.

462
00:31:21,786 --> 00:31:24,537
You think you know pain?

463
00:31:24,746 --> 00:31:30,417
He will make you long
for something sweet as pain.

464
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:00,647
Stow the captain's gear.

465
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:01,780
Yes, sir.

466
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,448
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

467
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:07,946
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

468
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:09,121
They need you on the bridge.

469
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:10,746
They're starting the face-trace.

470
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:12,041
See you there.

471
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,925
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

472
00:32:18,218 --> 00:32:20,792
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

473
00:32:21,013 --> 00:32:23,884
Did he ask you to sign
his Captain America trading cards yet?

474
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:25,298
Trading cards?

475
00:32:25,518 --> 00:32:27,676
They're vintage. He's very proud.

476
00:32:29,438 --> 00:32:30,719
Dr Banner.

477
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:34,014
Yeah, hi.

478
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:35,767
They told me you would be coming.

479
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,268
Word is, you can find the Cube.

480
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,197
Is that the only word on me?

481
00:32:40,617 --> 00:32:41,780
Only word I care about.

482
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,956
It must be strange for you, all of this.

483
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,335
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

484
00:32:50,543 --> 00:32:53,117
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

485
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,090
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

486
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,884
<i>Flight crew, secure the deck.</i>

487
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,968
Is this a submarine?

488
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:06,513
Really?

489
00:33:06,644 --> 00:33:10,392
They want me in a submerged,
pressurised, metal container?

490
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,171
No, no, this is much worse.

491
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:11,704
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

492
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,327
Increase collective to 8.0%.

493
00:34:19,427 --> 00:34:21,716
Preparing for maximum
performance takeoff.

494
00:34:21,846 --> 00:34:23,340
Increase output to capacity.

495
00:34:23,515 --> 00:34:25,638
Power plant performing at capacity.

496
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,309
We are clear.

497
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:29,013
All engines operating.

498
00:34:29,229 --> 00:34:33,855
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

499
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:36,646
- We are at level, sir.
- Good.

500
00:34:37,028 --> 00:34:38,024
Let's vanish.

501
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:40,645
Engage retro-reflection panels.

502
00:34:56,424 --> 00:34:57,586
Reflection panels engaged.

503
00:34:58,217 --> 00:34:59,592
Gentlemen.

504
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:13,054
Doctor, thank you for coming.

505
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:16,941
Thanks for asking nicely.

506
00:35:17,153 --> 00:35:19,775
So, how long am I staying?

507
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,781
Once we get our hands on
the Tesseract,

508
00:35:21,908 --> 00:35:23,106
you're in the wind.

509
00:35:23,243 --> 00:35:25,070
Where are you with that?

510
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:27,029
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible

511
00:35:27,163 --> 00:35:28,159
camera on the planet.

512
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:30,539
Cell phones, laptops...

513
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:34,370
If it's connected to a satellite,
it's eyes and ears for us.

514
00:35:34,587 --> 00:35:35,833
That's still not gonna find them in time.

515
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:37,043
You have to narrow your field.

516
00:35:37,257 --> 00:35:39,214
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

517
00:35:39,426 --> 00:35:41,051
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know.

518
00:35:41,261 --> 00:35:42,969
Tell them to put
the spectrometers on the roof

519
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:44,555
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

520
00:35:44,765 --> 00:35:47,968
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

521
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:50,677
At least we could rule out a few places.

522
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:52,729
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

523
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:54,096
Agent Romanoff,

524
00:35:54,274 --> 00:35:56,516
could you show Dr Banner
to his laboratory, please?

525
00:35:57,653 --> 00:35:59,895
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

526
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:02,239
Put it over there.

527
00:36:04,243 --> 00:36:06,366
Where did you find all these people?

528
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:09,533
S.H.I.E.L.D. Has no shortage
of enemies, Doctor.

529
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:11,079
Is this the stuff you need?

530
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:12,246
Yeah, iridium.

531
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:15,040
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

532
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:16,880
It's very hard to get hold of.

533
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,632
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
Knows you need it.

534
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:20,216
Well, I didn't know.

535
00:36:20,426 --> 00:36:21,624
Hey!

536
00:36:21,844 --> 00:36:24,133
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

537
00:36:24,597 --> 00:36:26,507
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

538
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:27,637
I know.

539
00:36:28,476 --> 00:36:30,386
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

540
00:36:31,354 --> 00:36:32,765
My next target.

541
00:36:32,939 --> 00:36:33,935
Tell me what you need.

542
00:36:37,444 --> 00:36:39,271
I need a distraction.

543
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,608
And an eyeball.

544
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,910
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

545
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,156
No, no. It's fine.

546
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,790
It's a vintage set.

547
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,295
It took me a couple of years
to collect them all.

548
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:02,924
Near mint.

549
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,513
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

550
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,344
We got a hit. A 67% match.

551
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,475
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

552
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:11,474
Location?

553
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,682
Stuttgart, Germany. 28 Königstrasse.

554
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,144
He's not exactly hiding.

555
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,474
Captain,

556
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:18,815
you're up.

557
00:39:54,356 --> 00:39:55,471
Kneel before me.

558
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:01,225
I said

559
00:40:03,323 --> 00:40:05,481
kneel!

560
00:40:14,793 --> 00:40:18,163
Is not this simpler?

561
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:22,919
Is this not your natural state?

562
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,424
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

563
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,013
that you crave subjugation.

564
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,344
The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy

565
00:40:35,564 --> 00:40:38,138
in a mad scramble for power,

566
00:40:39,986 --> 00:40:41,361
for identity.

567
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:46,365
You were made to be ruled.

568
00:40:46,993 --> 00:40:48,618
In the end,

569
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,158
you will always kneel.

570
00:40:58,546 --> 00:41:00,504
Not to men like you.

571
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,459
There are no men like me.

572
00:41:04,344 --> 00:41:07,215
There are always men like you.

573
00:41:08,515 --> 00:41:10,342
Look to your elder, people.

574
00:41:12,561 --> 00:41:13,972
Let him be an example.

575
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:23,351
You know, the last time
I was in Germany,

576
00:41:23,572 --> 00:41:26,739
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

577
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,410
we ended up disagreeing.

578
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,576
The soldier.

579
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,868
The man out of time.

580
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:35,704
I'm not the one who's out of time.

581
00:41:39,214 --> 00:41:41,752
<i>Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.</i>

582
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:03,690
Kneel.

583
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,233
Not today!

584
00:42:07,326 --> 00:42:08,607
The guy's all over the place.

585
00:42:12,122 --> 00:42:14,447
<i>Agent Romanoff. You miss me?</i>

586
00:42:31,184 --> 00:42:32,644
<i>Make your move, Reindeer Games.</i>

587
00:42:32,644 --> 00:42:33,260
<i>Make your move, Reindeer Games.</i>

588
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:42,778
<i>Good move.</i>

589
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,561
Mr Stark.

590
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:47,403
<i>Captain.</i>

591
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,249
<i>Is he saying anything?</i>

592
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,705
Not a word.

593
00:42:58,003 --> 00:42:59,913
<i>Just get him here. We're low on time.</i>

594
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:03,963
I don't like it.

595
00:43:04,343 --> 00:43:06,300
What, Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

596
00:43:06,511 --> 00:43:08,171
I don't remember it being that easy.

597
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:09,805
This guy packs a wallop.

598
00:43:10,015 --> 00:43:13,598
Still, you are pretty spry
for an older fellow.

599
00:43:14,645 --> 00:43:16,223
What's your thing, Pilates?

600
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:17,393
What?

601
00:43:17,565 --> 00:43:18,561
It's like calisthenics.

602
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:20,731
You might have missed
a couple of things

603
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:22,568
doing time as a Capsicle.

604
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:26,067
Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

605
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:29,153
Yeah, there's a lot of things
Fury doesn't tell you.

606
00:43:29,536 --> 00:43:31,114
Where's this coming from?

607
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:37,781
What's the matter? Are you
scared of a little lightning?

608
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:40,500
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

609
00:43:58,316 --> 00:43:59,477
What are you doing?

610
00:44:12,413 --> 00:44:13,872
<i>And now there's that guy.</i>

611
00:44:14,081 --> 00:44:15,825
Another Asgardian?

612
00:44:16,042 --> 00:44:17,869
<i>- That guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.</i>

613
00:44:18,086 --> 00:44:20,659
<i>If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.</i>

614
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,707
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

615
00:44:22,924 --> 00:44:25,213
<i>I have a plan. Attack.</i>

616
00:44:31,224 --> 00:44:33,015
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

617
00:44:33,226 --> 00:44:34,222
I don't see how I can.

618
00:44:34,436 --> 00:44:37,057
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

619
00:44:37,522 --> 00:44:38,803
There's only one God, ma'am.

620
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,313
And I'm pretty sure
he doesn't dress like that.

621
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:58,167
Where is the Tesseract?

622
00:44:58,377 --> 00:44:59,657
I missed you, too.

623
00:44:59,878 --> 00:45:01,547
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

624
00:45:02,256 --> 00:45:03,631
You should thank me.

625
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:06,131
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

626
00:45:06,344 --> 00:45:09,096
did the Allfather have to
muster to conjure you here

627
00:45:09,305 --> 00:45:10,681
to your precious Earth?

628
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:16,092
I thought you dead.

629
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:19,142
Did you mourn?

630
00:45:19,608 --> 00:45:21,398
We all did. Our father...

631
00:45:21,734 --> 00:45:24,652
Your father.

632
00:45:26,531 --> 00:45:29,402
He did tell you
my true parentage, did he not?

633
00:45:31,953 --> 00:45:34,195
We were raised together.

634
00:45:34,414 --> 00:45:37,036
We played together,
we fought together.

635
00:45:37,543 --> 00:45:38,741
Do you remember none of that?

636
00:45:38,961 --> 00:45:40,918
I remember a shadow.

637
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:45,459
Living in the shade of your greatness.

638
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:48,797
I remember you tossing me
into an abyss.

639
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:50,922
I, who was, and should be, king!

640
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:53,216
So you take the world I love
as a recompense

641
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,177
for your imagined slights?

642
00:45:55,394 --> 00:45:58,479
No. The Earth is under
my protection, Loki.

643
00:45:59,899 --> 00:46:03,434
And you're doing
a marvellous job with that.

644
00:46:03,903 --> 00:46:05,860
The humans slaughter
each other in droves

645
00:46:05,989 --> 00:46:07,780
while you idly fret.

646
00:46:07,991 --> 00:46:10,149
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

647
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:11,911
You think yourself above them?

648
00:46:12,996 --> 00:46:13,992
Well, yes.

649
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:16,660
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

650
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,875
A throne would suit you ill.

651
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,842
I've seen worlds
you've never known about!

652
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:31,216
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

653
00:46:31,598 --> 00:46:33,556
I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract,

654
00:46:33,684 --> 00:46:34,763
and when I wield it...

655
00:46:34,977 --> 00:46:36,720
Who showed you this power?

656
00:46:37,897 --> 00:46:39,225
Who controls the would-be king?

657
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,232
- I am a king!
- Not here!

658
00:46:41,442 --> 00:46:42,722
You give up the Tesseract!

659
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:45,397
You give up this poisonous dream!

660
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:49,490
You come home.

661
00:46:54,455 --> 00:46:55,570
I don't have it.

662
00:46:57,667 --> 00:46:59,458
You need the Cube to bring me home.

663
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:01,911
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

664
00:47:03,048 --> 00:47:04,875
You listen well, brother.

665
00:47:06,843 --> 00:47:08,041
I'm listening.

666
00:47:17,187 --> 00:47:18,847
Do not touch me again.

667
00:47:19,064 --> 00:47:20,641
Then don't take my stuff.

668
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:23,099
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

669
00:47:24,987 --> 00:47:25,983
Shakespeare in the Park?

670
00:47:27,364 --> 00:47:30,484
Doth Mother know
you wear-eth her drapes?

671
00:47:30,743 --> 00:47:33,495
This is beyond you, metal man.

672
00:47:33,704 --> 00:47:35,826
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

673
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:39,408
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours. Until then,

674
00:47:39,793 --> 00:47:41,038
<i>stay out of the way.</i>

675
00:47:42,588 --> 00:47:44,212
<i>Tourist.</i>

676
00:47:49,595 --> 00:47:50,627
Okay.

677
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:23,337
Power at 400% capacity.

678
00:48:23,547 --> 00:48:25,089
How about that?

679
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:26,600
Hey!

680
00:49:29,156 --> 00:49:30,354
That's enough.

681
00:49:34,245 --> 00:49:35,953
Now, I don't know
what you plan on doing here.

682
00:49:36,163 --> 00:49:38,452
I've come here to put an end
to Loki's schemes.

683
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:41,204
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

684
00:49:41,336 --> 00:49:42,331
Yeah... No.

685
00:49:42,587 --> 00:49:44,046
<i>Bad call. He loves his hammer.</i>

686
00:49:45,632 --> 00:49:47,874
You want me to put the hammer down?

687
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:16,906
Are we done, here?

688
00:51:04,797 --> 00:51:07,751
In case it's unclear,

689
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:10,259
if you try to escape,

690
00:51:11,345 --> 00:51:13,633
if you so much as scratch that glass,

691
00:51:23,232 --> 00:51:27,182
it's 30,000 feet straight down
in a steel trap.

692
00:51:27,737 --> 00:51:29,860
You get how that works?

693
00:51:31,908 --> 00:51:34,530
Ant, boot.

694
00:51:37,873 --> 00:51:39,615
It's an impressive cage.

695
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:43,163
Not built, I think, for me.

696
00:51:43,544 --> 00:51:45,952
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

697
00:51:46,172 --> 00:51:48,046
Oh, I've heard.

698
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,213
<i>A mindless beast.</i>

699
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:52,844
<i>Makes play he's still a man.</i>

700
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:56,172
<i>How desperate are you,</i>

701
00:51:56,391 --> 00:51:59,476
<i>that you call on such
lost creatures to defend you?</i>

702
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:02,012
<i>How desperate am I?</i>

703
00:52:02,231 --> 00:52:04,023
You threaten my world with war.

704
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:06,356
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

705
00:52:06,568 --> 00:52:10,352
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

706
00:52:10,572 --> 00:52:13,573
You have made me very desperate.

707
00:52:13,784 --> 00:52:15,693
You might not be glad that you did.

708
00:52:18,956 --> 00:52:22,242
It burns you to have come so close.

709
00:52:23,711 --> 00:52:26,416
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

710
00:52:27,215 --> 00:52:29,422
unlimited power.

711
00:52:29,634 --> 00:52:31,592
And for what?

712
00:52:33,263 --> 00:52:33,971
A warm light for all mankind to share.

713
00:52:33,971 --> 00:52:37,056
A warm light for all mankind to share.

714
00:52:37,308 --> 00:52:40,558
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

715
00:52:44,649 --> 00:52:48,943
Well, let me know if "real power"
wants a magazine or something.

716
00:52:57,288 --> 00:52:58,747
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

717
00:52:58,956 --> 00:53:00,865
Loki's gonna drag this out.

718
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:04,534
So, Thor, what's his play?

719
00:53:04,753 --> 00:53:07,291
He has an army called the Chitauri.

720
00:53:07,506 --> 00:53:10,424
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

721
00:53:10,843 --> 00:53:12,919
He means to lead them
against your people.

722
00:53:13,137 --> 00:53:14,715
They will win him the Earth,

723
00:53:14,847 --> 00:53:16,639
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

724
00:53:16,849 --> 00:53:18,593
An army

725
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,470
from outer space.

726
00:53:20,687 --> 00:53:23,095
So, he's building another portal.

727
00:53:23,315 --> 00:53:24,643
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

728
00:53:24,774 --> 00:53:25,770
Selvig?

729
00:53:25,942 --> 00:53:28,267
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

730
00:53:28,486 --> 00:53:30,609
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

731
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,274
along with one of ours.

732
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:34,068
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

733
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,481
He's not leading an army from here.

734
00:53:35,702 --> 00:53:37,410
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

735
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:39,412
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

736
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:40,820
You could smell crazy on him.

737
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:42,784
Have care how you speak.

738
00:53:43,335 --> 00:53:45,541
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

739
00:53:45,963 --> 00:53:47,042
And he is my brother.

740
00:53:47,256 --> 00:53:49,130
He killed 80 people in two days.

741
00:53:50,009 --> 00:53:51,005
He's adopted.

742
00:53:51,177 --> 00:53:53,466
I think it's about the mechanics.

743
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:55,636
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

744
00:53:55,847 --> 00:53:56,843
It's a stabilising agent.

745
00:53:57,015 --> 00:53:58,296
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

746
00:53:58,433 --> 00:53:59,976
I'll fly you to Portland.

747
00:54:00,185 --> 00:54:01,728
Keep love alive.

748
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:03,811
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

749
00:54:03,981 --> 00:54:05,808
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

750
00:54:06,025 --> 00:54:09,311
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

751
00:54:09,529 --> 00:54:11,771
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

752
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:14,397
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

753
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,324
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

754
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:20,237
<i>That man is playing Galaga.</i>

755
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:24,659
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

756
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:28,005
How does Fury even see these?

757
00:54:28,173 --> 00:54:29,168
He turns.

758
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,090
Sounds exhausting.

759
00:54:32,177 --> 00:54:33,339
The rest of the raw materials,

760
00:54:33,553 --> 00:54:36,341
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

761
00:54:36,556 --> 00:54:37,932
The only major component
he still needs

762
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:41,641
is a power source
of high-energy density.

763
00:54:41,854 --> 00:54:45,104
Something to kick-start the Cube.

764
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:48,270
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

765
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:49,481
Last night.

766
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:53,190
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

767
00:54:53,407 --> 00:54:54,403
Am I the only one who did the reading?

768
00:54:54,575 --> 00:54:57,362
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

769
00:54:57,578 --> 00:55:00,283
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

770
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:01,957
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

771
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,373
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilise

772
00:55:04,585 --> 00:55:05,700
the quantum tunnelling effect.

773
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,916
Well, if he could do that,

774
00:55:07,088 --> 00:55:09,544
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

775
00:55:09,758 --> 00:55:12,165
Finally, someone who speaks English.

776
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:14,343
Is that what just happened?

777
00:55:14,554 --> 00:55:16,546
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

778
00:55:16,764 --> 00:55:19,801
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

779
00:55:20,018 --> 00:55:21,809
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

780
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,059
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

781
00:55:25,607 --> 00:55:26,638
Thanks.

782
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:29,349
Dr Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

783
00:55:29,569 --> 00:55:30,850
I was hoping you might join him.

784
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,234
I would start with that stick of his.

785
00:55:32,364 --> 00:55:33,395
It may be magical,

786
00:55:33,532 --> 00:55:34,813
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

787
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:37,987
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

788
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:40,031
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

789
00:55:40,247 --> 00:55:41,825
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

790
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,748
into his personal flying monkeys.

791
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:45,668
Monkeys? I do not understand.

792
00:55:45,794 --> 00:55:46,790
I do.

793
00:55:49,798 --> 00:55:51,672
I understood that reference.

794
00:55:52,593 --> 00:55:53,921
Shall we play, Doctor?

795
00:55:54,136 --> 00:55:55,844
This way, sir.

796
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,396
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

797
00:56:11,612 --> 00:56:13,605
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

798
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:15,614
But it's going to take weeks to process.

799
00:56:15,825 --> 00:56:17,023
If we bypass their mainframe

800
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,440
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

801
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:21,746
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

802
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:24,873
All I packed was a toothbrush.

803
00:56:25,961 --> 00:56:27,539
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

804
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:29,794
Top ten floors, all R&D.

805
00:56:30,132 --> 00:56:31,591
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

806
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:34,292
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

807
00:56:34,512 --> 00:56:37,049
I kind of broke Harlem.

808
00:56:37,264 --> 00:56:39,091
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

809
00:56:39,308 --> 00:56:41,099
No tension, no surprises.

810
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:44,097
- Hey!
- Nothing?

811
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:45,309
Are you nuts?

812
00:56:45,439 --> 00:56:46,435
Jury's out.

813
00:56:46,565 --> 00:56:47,680
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

814
00:56:47,817 --> 00:56:48,812
What's your secret?

815
00:56:48,943 --> 00:56:50,402
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

816
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:51,684
Is everything a joke to you?

817
00:56:51,988 --> 00:56:52,984
Funny things are.

818
00:56:53,114 --> 00:56:54,857
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

819
00:56:54,991 --> 00:56:56,236
isn't funny.

820
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:57,363
No offence, Doc.

821
00:56:57,494 --> 00:56:58,988
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

822
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,956
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

823
00:57:02,082 --> 00:57:04,654
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

824
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:06,452
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr Stark.

825
00:57:06,586 --> 00:57:08,080
Do you think I'm not?

826
00:57:08,212 --> 00:57:11,000
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

827
00:57:11,132 --> 00:57:12,876
What isn't he telling us?

828
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:14,753
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

829
00:57:15,387 --> 00:57:16,632
You think Fury's hiding something?

830
00:57:16,763 --> 00:57:19,930
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

831
00:57:20,058 --> 00:57:21,802
His secrets have secrets.

832
00:57:21,935 --> 00:57:23,430
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

833
00:57:26,023 --> 00:57:27,815
I just want to finish my work here, and...

834
00:57:27,942 --> 00:57:28,938
Doctor?

835
00:57:34,364 --> 00:57:36,737
"A warm light for all mankind."

836
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:38,943
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

837
00:57:39,078 --> 00:57:40,537
I heard it.

838
00:57:40,663 --> 00:57:42,952
I think that was meant for you.

839
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:46,620
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

840
00:57:46,753 --> 00:57:47,832
it was still all over the news.

841
00:57:47,962 --> 00:57:50,038
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

842
00:57:51,382 --> 00:57:52,628
building in New York?

843
00:57:52,759 --> 00:57:56,460
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

844
00:57:56,596 --> 00:57:59,003
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

845
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,967
It's just the prototype.

846
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,058
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

847
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:04,889
That's what he's getting at.

848
00:58:05,021 --> 00:58:07,595
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. Bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

849
00:58:07,732 --> 00:58:09,476
What are they doing
in the energy business

850
00:58:09,609 --> 00:58:10,938
in the first place?

851
00:58:11,069 --> 00:58:14,023
I should probably look into that
once my decryption programme

852
00:58:14,156 --> 00:58:16,314
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

853
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,446
I'm sorry. Did you say...

854
00:58:17,576 --> 00:58:19,569
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

855
00:58:19,703 --> 00:58:21,281
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

856
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,576
S.H.I.E.L.D. Has ever tried to hide.

857
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:23,702
Blueberry?

858
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,706
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

859
00:58:25,834 --> 00:58:28,669
An intelligence organisation
that fears intelligence?

860
00:58:28,795 --> 00:58:30,373
Historically, not awesome.

861
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:32,795
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

862
00:58:32,925 --> 00:58:34,503
This is a man who means to start a war

863
00:58:34,635 --> 00:58:36,177
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

864
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:39,927
We have orders.
We should follow them.

865
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,426
Following's not really my style.

866
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,017
And you're all about style, aren't you?

867
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,179
Of the people in this room,

868
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,893
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

869
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,354
and, B, not of use?

870
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:54,814
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

871
00:58:57,533 --> 00:58:58,565
Just find the Cube.

872
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:13,416
That's the guy
my dad never shut up about?

873
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,672
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

874
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:19,221
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

875
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,091
He does have the jump on us.

876
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,929
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

877
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,888
It's going to blow up in his face.

878
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,310
And I'm going to be there when it does.

879
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,766
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

880
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:34,184
Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

881
00:59:35,782 --> 00:59:39,365
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

882
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:42,828
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

883
00:59:42,956 --> 00:59:44,699
It's a nightmare.

884
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:47,619
I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

885
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:49,745
to crawl its way into my heart.

886
00:59:49,879 --> 00:59:51,919
This stops it.

887
00:59:52,048 --> 00:59:54,373
This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

888
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:57,254
not just armour.

889
00:59:57,929 --> 01:00:00,385
It's a terrible privilege.

890
01:00:00,724 --> 01:00:03,096
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

891
01:00:03,227 --> 01:00:04,222
It's different.

892
01:00:04,561 --> 01:00:07,895
Hey, I read all about your accident.

893
01:00:08,023 --> 01:00:11,357
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

894
01:00:11,485 --> 01:00:13,940
So you're saying that the Hulk...

895
01:00:15,405 --> 01:00:17,778
The other guy saved my life?

896
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:19,398
That's nice.

897
01:00:20,285 --> 01:00:24,070
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

898
01:00:25,374 --> 01:00:27,284
I guess we'll find out.

899
01:00:29,003 --> 01:00:30,663
You may not enjoy that.

900
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:32,754
And you just might.

901
01:01:31,985 --> 01:01:33,360
<i>As soon as Loki took the doctor,</i>

902
01:01:33,487 --> 01:01:35,229
we moved Jane Foster.

903
01:01:35,363 --> 01:01:37,735
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromsø.

904
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:41,400
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

905
01:01:41,536 --> 01:01:45,320
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

906
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:47,239
She'll be safe.

907
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:48,751
Thank you.

908
01:01:50,546 --> 01:01:52,585
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

909
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:56,164
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

910
01:01:56,302 --> 01:01:57,416
Erik is a good man.

911
01:01:57,553 --> 01:01:58,549
He talks about you a lot.

912
01:02:00,431 --> 01:02:02,423
You changed his life.

913
01:02:04,142 --> 01:02:06,016
You changed everything around here.

914
01:02:06,145 --> 01:02:08,268
They were better as they were.

915
01:02:08,856 --> 01:02:10,932
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

916
01:02:11,066 --> 01:02:14,767
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

917
01:02:14,904 --> 01:02:16,731
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

918
01:02:16,864 --> 01:02:19,901
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

919
01:02:20,702 --> 01:02:22,493
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

920
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,494
Well, they are repulsive.

921
01:02:25,832 --> 01:02:28,074
And they trample everything
in their path.

922
01:02:35,758 --> 01:02:39,092
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

923
01:02:39,221 --> 01:02:41,546
and your people paid the price.

924
01:02:41,681 --> 01:02:43,473
And now, again.

925
01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:48,475
In my youth, I courted war.

926
01:02:50,232 --> 01:02:52,225
War hasn't started yet.

927
01:02:53,361 --> 01:02:55,152
You think you could make Loki tell us

928
01:02:55,279 --> 01:02:56,559
where the Tesseract is?

929
01:02:56,696 --> 01:02:59,947
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

930
01:03:00,075 --> 01:03:04,784
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

931
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:07,037
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

932
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:10,332
A lot of guys think that

933
01:03:10,461 --> 01:03:11,955
until the pain starts.

934
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:15,751
What are you asking me to do?

935
01:03:15,884 --> 01:03:19,467
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

936
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:20,627
Loki is a prisoner.

937
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:23,088
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

938
01:03:23,224 --> 01:03:24,802
that wants to be here?

939
01:03:37,406 --> 01:03:40,490
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

940
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:42,278
But you figured I'd come.

941
01:03:42,953 --> 01:03:44,531
After.

942
01:03:45,414 --> 01:03:48,830
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

943
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,624
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

944
01:03:53,589 --> 01:03:55,249
And I would cooperate.

945
01:03:55,382 --> 01:03:57,375
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

946
01:03:57,509 --> 01:03:59,502
I would say I've expanded his mind.

947
01:04:02,098 --> 01:04:04,007
And once you've won,

948
01:04:04,892 --> 01:04:06,173
once you're king of the mountain,

949
01:04:08,313 --> 01:04:10,804
what happens to his mind?

950
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:13,858
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

951
01:04:13,985 --> 01:04:16,821
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

952
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,574
Tell me.

953
01:04:26,915 --> 01:04:30,165
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L. D... I...

954
01:04:32,588 --> 01:04:36,502
Well, I made a name for myself.

955
01:04:36,634 --> 01:04:39,635
I have a very specific skill set.

956
01:04:39,762 --> 01:04:43,427
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

957
01:04:44,433 --> 01:04:47,932
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

958
01:04:49,104 --> 01:04:52,022
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

959
01:04:53,067 --> 01:04:54,609
He made a different call.

960
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:59,607
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

961
01:04:59,991 --> 01:05:01,319
Not let you out.

962
01:05:01,451 --> 01:05:03,325
No, but I like this.

963
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:07,662
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

964
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:09,867
Regimes fall every day.

965
01:05:10,002 --> 01:05:12,539
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

966
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:13,666
Or I was.

967
01:05:14,964 --> 01:05:16,624
And what are you now?

968
01:05:17,091 --> 01:05:20,046
It's really not that complicated.

969
01:05:20,178 --> 01:05:24,258
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

970
01:05:25,267 --> 01:05:26,809
Can you?

971
01:05:28,145 --> 01:05:31,929
Can you wipe out that much red?

972
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:34,900
Dreykov's daughter,

973
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,146
São Paulo,

974
01:05:39,197 --> 01:05:41,689
the hospital fire?

975
01:05:42,534 --> 01:05:44,907
Barton told me everything.

976
01:05:45,037 --> 01:05:48,121
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

977
01:05:48,249 --> 01:05:50,740
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

978
01:05:50,876 --> 01:05:52,252
will change anything?

979
01:05:52,378 --> 01:05:55,048
This is the basest sentimentality.

980
01:05:55,173 --> 01:05:57,415
This is a child at prayer.

981
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:58,831
Pathetic!

982
01:05:59,636 --> 01:06:02,209
<i>You lie and kill</i>

983
01:06:02,347 --> 01:06:05,383
<i>in the service of liars and killers.</i>

984
01:06:08,478 --> 01:06:11,645
<i>You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,</i>

985
01:06:11,773 --> 01:06:14,478
<i>something that makes up
for the horrors.</i>

986
01:06:15,652 --> 01:06:18,060
<i>But they are part of you.</i>

987
01:06:18,196 --> 01:06:21,981
<i>And they will never go away.</i>

988
01:06:22,576 --> 01:06:26,076
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

989
01:06:26,205 --> 01:06:28,447
Slowly, intimately,

990
01:06:28,582 --> 01:06:30,955
in every way he knows you fear.

991
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:34,169
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

992
01:06:34,296 --> 01:06:37,747
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

993
01:06:37,883 --> 01:06:41,003
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

994
01:06:42,596 --> 01:06:44,174
You're a monster.

995
01:06:46,392 --> 01:06:47,886
Oh, no.

996
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:50,347
You brought the monster.

997
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:54,936
So, Banner.

998
01:06:55,986 --> 01:06:57,148
That's your play.

999
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:58,310
What?

1000
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,940
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

1001
01:07:01,073 --> 01:07:02,532
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

1002
01:07:02,658 --> 01:07:03,738
Send Thor as well.

1003
01:07:05,411 --> 01:07:06,740
Thank you

1004
01:07:06,871 --> 01:07:09,030
for your cooperation.

1005
01:07:16,548 --> 01:07:18,007
What are you doing, Mr Stark?

1006
01:07:18,133 --> 01:07:20,625
Kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1007
01:07:20,761 --> 01:07:22,635
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

1008
01:07:22,763 --> 01:07:24,341
We are. The model's locked

1009
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:25,754
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

1010
01:07:25,892 --> 01:07:26,886
When we get a hit,

1011
01:07:27,017 --> 01:07:28,974
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1012
01:07:29,102 --> 01:07:31,605
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1013
01:07:31,605 --> 01:07:33,349
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1014
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:34,597
What is "Phase 2"?

1015
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,654
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. Uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1016
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,524
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1017
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:44,362
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

1018
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:45,953
This does not mean that we're making...

1019
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:47,075
I'm sorry, Nick.

1020
01:07:47,205 --> 01:07:49,494
What were you lying?

1021
01:07:49,624 --> 01:07:50,869
I was wrong, Director.

1022
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:52,032
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1023
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:53,200
Did you know about this?

1024
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:54,664
You want to think about
removing yourself

1025
01:07:54,795 --> 01:07:56,124
from this environment, Doctor?

1026
01:07:56,255 --> 01:07:58,414
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1027
01:07:58,549 --> 01:07:59,712
Loki is manipulating you.

1028
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:01,420
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1029
01:08:01,553 --> 01:08:03,213
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1030
01:08:03,346 --> 01:08:04,461
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1031
01:08:04,598 --> 01:08:05,878
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

1032
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:07,640
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1033
01:08:07,768 --> 01:08:11,468
Is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

1034
01:08:12,106 --> 01:08:13,220
Because of him.

1035
01:08:14,525 --> 01:08:15,521
Me?

1036
01:08:16,485 --> 01:08:18,858
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

1037
01:08:18,988 --> 01:08:22,154
who had a grudge match
that levelled a small town.

1038
01:08:22,282 --> 01:08:24,489
We learned that
not only are we not alone

1039
01:08:24,618 --> 01:08:28,201
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1040
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:30,572
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1041
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:32,665
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

1042
01:08:32,793 --> 01:08:34,751
And you're not the only threat.

1043
01:08:34,879 --> 01:08:38,046
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

1044
01:08:38,716 --> 01:08:39,915
that can't be controlled.

1045
01:08:40,051 --> 01:08:41,166
Like you controlled the Cube?

1046
01:08:41,302 --> 01:08:42,548
Your work with the Tesseract

1047
01:08:42,679 --> 01:08:45,253
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1048
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:46,766
It is a signal to all the realms

1049
01:08:46,892 --> 01:08:49,560
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1050
01:08:49,685 --> 01:08:50,765
A higher form?

1051
01:08:50,895 --> 01:08:51,891
You forced our hand.

1052
01:08:52,021 --> 01:08:53,017
We had to come up with something.

1053
01:08:53,147 --> 01:08:54,143
A nuclear deterrent.

1054
01:08:54,274 --> 01:08:56,266
Because that always
calms everything right down.

1055
01:08:56,401 --> 01:08:58,773
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

1056
01:08:58,904 --> 01:09:01,276
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

1057
01:09:01,406 --> 01:09:03,031
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1058
01:09:03,158 --> 01:09:04,273
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1059
01:09:04,409 --> 01:09:06,283
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

1060
01:09:06,412 --> 01:09:09,282
Excuse me, did we come to
your planet and blow stuff up?

1061
01:09:09,415 --> 01:09:11,289
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

1062
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:12,876
Are you boys really that naïve?

1063
01:09:13,002 --> 01:09:14,875
S.H.I.E.L.D. Monitors potential threats.

1064
01:09:15,003 --> 01:09:16,284
Captain America's on threat watch?

1065
01:09:16,421 --> 01:09:17,417
We all are.

1066
01:09:17,547 --> 01:09:18,958
Wait, you're on that list?

1067
01:09:19,091 --> 01:09:20,633
Are you above or below angry bees?

1068
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:22,882
Stark, so help me God,
if you make one more wisecrack...

1069
01:09:23,012 --> 01:09:24,257
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1070
01:09:24,388 --> 01:09:26,879
- Show some respect.
- Respect what?

1071
01:09:34,232 --> 01:09:37,150
<i>Transport Six-Six-Bravo,
please relay confirm codes.</i>

1072
01:09:37,277 --> 01:09:39,435
<i>I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.</i>

1073
01:09:39,571 --> 01:09:41,646
<i>What is your haul? Over.</i>

1074
01:09:41,781 --> 01:09:44,402
<i>Arms and ammunition. Over.</i>

1075
01:09:52,751 --> 01:09:54,957
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

1076
01:09:55,087 --> 01:09:56,795
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1077
01:09:56,922 --> 01:09:58,167
I mean, what are we, a team?

1078
01:09:58,298 --> 01:10:01,253
No, we're a chemical mixture
that makes chaos.

1079
01:10:01,385 --> 01:10:03,342
We're a time bomb.

1080
01:10:03,471 --> 01:10:05,297
You need to step away.

1081
01:10:05,431 --> 01:10:07,258
Why shouldn't the guy
let off a little steam?

1082
01:10:07,391 --> 01:10:09,513
You know damn well why. Back off!

1083
01:10:09,643 --> 01:10:11,849
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1084
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:15,597
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

1085
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:17,191
Take that off, what are you?

1086
01:10:17,318 --> 01:10:19,643
Genius, billionaire,
playboy, philanthropist.

1087
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:23,696
I know guys with none of that
worth ten of you.

1088
01:10:23,825 --> 01:10:24,820
I've seen the footage.

1089
01:10:24,951 --> 01:10:27,193
The only thing you really
fight for is yourself.

1090
01:10:28,663 --> 01:10:30,572
You're not the guy
to make the sacrifice play,

1091
01:10:30,707 --> 01:10:33,198
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

1092
01:10:33,335 --> 01:10:35,458
I think I would just cut the wire.

1093
01:10:38,089 --> 01:10:40,295
Always a way out.

1094
01:10:40,425 --> 01:10:41,670
You may not be a threat

1095
01:10:41,801 --> 01:10:43,710
but you better stop pretending
to be a hero.

1096
01:10:43,845 --> 01:10:46,301
A hero? Like you?

1097
01:10:46,431 --> 01:10:48,471
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1098
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,218
Everything special about you
came out of a bottle.

1099
01:11:17,505 --> 01:11:20,340
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1100
01:11:21,342 --> 01:11:24,794
You people are so petty and tiny.

1101
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:25,925
Yeah, this is a team.

1102
01:11:26,056 --> 01:11:27,301
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1103
01:11:27,432 --> 01:11:28,547
Dr Banner back to his...

1104
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,343
Where? You rented my room.

1105
01:11:30,476 --> 01:11:31,935
The cell was just in case...

1106
01:11:32,061 --> 01:11:33,603
In case you needed to kill me.

1107
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:36,647
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1108
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:42,278
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1109
01:11:42,405 --> 01:11:46,867
So, I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

1110
01:11:47,453 --> 01:11:48,651
So I moved on.

1111
01:11:48,787 --> 01:11:51,623
I focused on helping
other people. I was good.

1112
01:11:51,749 --> 01:11:53,955
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show

1113
01:11:54,085 --> 01:11:55,460
and put everyone here at risk.

1114
01:11:55,586 --> 01:11:57,661
You want to know my secret,
Agent Romanoff?

1115
01:11:57,796 --> 01:11:59,623
You want to know how I stay calm?

1116
01:12:02,426 --> 01:12:04,584
Dr Banner,

1117
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:06,716
put down the sceptre.

1118
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:16,644
Got it.

1119
01:12:17,484 --> 01:12:18,479
Sorry, kids,

1120
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:20,353
you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

1121
01:12:20,487 --> 01:12:21,483
You located the Tesseract?

1122
01:12:21,613 --> 01:12:22,609
I could get there fastest.

1123
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:24,861
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.

1124
01:12:24,991 --> 01:12:26,319
- You're not going alone.
- You're gonna stop me?

1125
01:12:26,451 --> 01:12:27,446
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1126
01:12:27,577 --> 01:12:28,857
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1127
01:12:28,995 --> 01:12:29,991
Put on the suit.

1128
01:12:32,874 --> 01:12:34,499
Oh, my God.

1129
01:12:50,017 --> 01:12:51,012
Put on the suit.

1130
01:12:51,143 --> 01:12:52,423
Yeah.

1131
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:56,932
<i>All hands to stations.</i>

1132
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:02,861
<i>- Hill!
- External detonation.</i>

1133
01:13:02,989 --> 01:13:04,234
Number three engine is down.

1134
01:13:04,365 --> 01:13:05,361
We've been hit.

1135
01:13:05,491 --> 01:13:06,654
- Can they get it running?
- Fire in engine three!

1136
01:13:06,784 --> 01:13:07,780
Talk to me.

1137
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:09,535
Turbine looks mostly intact

1138
01:13:09,662 --> 01:13:11,536
but it's impossible to
get out there to make repairs

1139
01:13:11,664 --> 01:13:13,075
while we're in the air.

1140
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:15,746
If we lose one more engine,
we won't be.

1141
01:13:15,877 --> 01:13:17,870
Somebody's got to get outside
and patch that engine.

1142
01:13:18,004 --> 01:13:19,712
<i>- Stark, you copy that?
- I'm on it.</i>

1143
01:13:19,839 --> 01:13:23,125
<i>Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown
in the detention section</i>

1144
01:13:23,259 --> 01:13:24,255
<i>then get to the armoury.</i>

1145
01:13:24,385 --> 01:13:25,500
Romanoff?

1146
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,599
We're okay.

1147
01:13:33,186 --> 01:13:34,432
We're okay, right?

1148
01:13:47,034 --> 01:13:48,232
- Keep that engine down!
- Yes, sir.

1149
01:13:48,368 --> 01:13:50,076
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1150
01:13:50,204 --> 01:13:51,995
- Got it.
- Stay close.

1151
01:13:53,749 --> 01:13:55,243
Let's go, Level 4.

1152
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,997
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1153
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:08,343
Doctor?

1154
01:14:10,726 --> 01:14:11,721
Bruce?

1155
01:14:12,019 --> 01:14:15,683
You got to fight it.
This is just what Loki wants.

1156
01:14:17,065 --> 01:14:18,096
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1157
01:14:18,233 --> 01:14:19,228
Are you hurt?

1158
01:14:22,529 --> 01:14:24,735
We're going to be okay. All right?

1159
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:27,617
I swear on my life,
I will get you out of this.

1160
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:29,118
You will walk away and never ever...

1161
01:14:29,244 --> 01:14:31,320
Your life?

1162
01:14:47,847 --> 01:14:48,842
Bruce.

1163
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:26,387
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1164
01:15:26,387 --> 01:15:28,878
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1165
01:15:29,014 --> 01:15:30,888
- Take us to the water!
- We're flying blind.

1166
01:15:31,017 --> 01:15:33,009
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

1167
01:15:33,144 --> 01:15:34,886
Is the sun coming up?

1168
01:15:35,646 --> 01:15:37,852
- Yes, sir.
- Then put it on the left.

1169
01:15:37,981 --> 01:15:39,641
Get us over water.

1170
01:15:39,775 --> 01:15:41,851
One more turbine goes down,
and we drop.

1171
01:15:44,113 --> 01:15:45,393
Thanks.

1172
01:15:48,743 --> 01:15:49,906
Stark!

1173
01:15:52,622 --> 01:15:54,282
Stark, I'm here!

1174
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:55,910
<i>Good.</i>

1175
01:15:57,127 --> 01:15:59,120
<i>Let's see what we've got.</i>

1176
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:00,913
I got to get this
superconducting coolant system

1177
01:16:01,047 --> 01:16:02,043
back online

1178
01:16:02,173 --> 01:16:03,632
before I can access the rotors,

1179
01:16:03,758 --> 01:16:05,585
work on dislodging the debris.

1180
01:16:08,138 --> 01:16:09,680
<i>I need you to get to that
engine control panel</i>

1181
01:16:09,806 --> 01:16:13,471
<i>and tell me which relays
are in overload position.</i>

1182
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:27,324
<i>What does it look like in there?</i>

1183
01:16:28,033 --> 01:16:30,571
It seems to run
on some form of electricity.

1184
01:16:30,702 --> 01:16:32,446
Well, you're not wrong.

1185
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:39,106
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1186
01:17:39,232 --> 01:17:40,228
Try to think!

1187
01:17:50,368 --> 01:17:52,242
<i>Okay, the relays are intact.</i>

1188
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:53,829
What's our next move?

1189
01:17:53,955 --> 01:17:54,951
<i>Even if I clear the rotors,</i>

1190
01:17:55,081 --> 01:17:57,288
<i>this thing won't
re-engage without a jump.</i>

1191
01:17:57,417 --> 01:17:58,792
I'm going to have to
get in there and push.

1192
01:17:58,919 --> 01:18:00,662
If that thing gets up to
speed, you'll get shredded.

1193
01:18:00,796 --> 01:18:02,788
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

1194
01:18:02,923 --> 01:18:04,334
long enough to disengage
maglev and that could...

1195
01:18:04,466 --> 01:18:05,795
Speak English!

1196
01:18:07,136 --> 01:18:08,250
You see that red lever?

1197
01:18:09,555 --> 01:18:11,678
<i>It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.</i>

1198
01:18:11,807 --> 01:18:13,599
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1199
01:19:06,197 --> 01:19:07,988
We need full evac
on the lower hangar bay.

1200
01:19:11,201 --> 01:19:12,232
Grenade!

1201
01:19:27,385 --> 01:19:28,713
<i>We've got a perimeter breach!</i>

1202
01:19:28,845 --> 01:19:30,885
<i>Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. Gear.</i>

1203
01:19:31,014 --> 01:19:33,090
<i>Call-outs at every junction.</i>

1204
01:19:40,398 --> 01:19:42,604
<i>We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4.</i>

1205
01:19:42,734 --> 01:19:44,276
<i>Levels 2 and 3 are dark.</i>

1206
01:19:44,402 --> 01:19:46,525
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1207
01:19:47,739 --> 01:19:48,735
Get his attention.

1208
01:19:48,865 --> 01:19:53,029
Escort 6-0, proceed to
Wishbone and engage hostile.

1209
01:19:53,162 --> 01:19:54,442
<i>Don't get too close.</i>

1210
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:55,955
<i>Copy.</i>

1211
01:20:07,885 --> 01:20:09,260
<i>Target acquired.</i>

1212
01:20:13,557 --> 01:20:14,553
<i>Target engaged.</i>

1213
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:27,738
<i>Target angry, target angry!</i>

1214
01:21:36,142 --> 01:21:38,349
They're not getting through
here, so what the hell...

1215
01:21:56,747 --> 01:21:58,989
<i>Engine one is now in shut-down.</i>

1216
01:22:07,425 --> 01:22:09,583
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1217
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:11,593
<i>Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.</i>

1218
01:22:12,138 --> 01:22:13,965
<i>It's Barton. He took out our systems.</i>

1219
01:22:14,099 --> 01:22:16,590
<i>He's headed for the detention level.</i>

1220
01:22:16,726 --> 01:22:18,684
<i>Does anybody copy?</i>

1221
01:22:19,854 --> 01:22:21,977
This is Agent Romanoff.

1222
01:22:22,106 --> 01:22:23,565
I copy.

1223
01:22:28,196 --> 01:22:29,192
<i>Stark, we're losing altitude.</i>

1224
01:22:29,322 --> 01:22:30,781
Yeah, I noticed.

1225
01:22:59,812 --> 01:23:00,843
No!

1226
01:23:08,446 --> 01:23:11,151
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1227
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,402
The humans think us immortal.

1228
01:23:57,497 --> 01:23:59,039
Should we test that?

1229
01:24:01,835 --> 01:24:03,033
Move away, please.

1230
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:09,001
You like this?

1231
01:24:09,967 --> 01:24:13,218
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

1232
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:16,672
Even I don't know what it does.

1233
01:24:17,475 --> 01:24:18,720
Do you want to find out?

1234
01:24:20,729 --> 01:24:22,188
No!

1235
01:25:31,718 --> 01:25:33,129
Natasha?

1236
01:26:04,711 --> 01:26:06,454
You're going to lose.

1237
01:26:08,507 --> 01:26:09,705
Am I?

1238
01:26:11,009 --> 01:26:13,500
It's in your nature.

1239
01:26:15,681 --> 01:26:18,006
Your heroes are scattered.

1240
01:26:18,142 --> 01:26:21,843
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1241
01:26:21,979 --> 01:26:23,603
Where is my disadvantage?

1242
01:26:24,272 --> 01:26:26,349
You lack conviction.

1243
01:26:27,192 --> 01:26:28,188
I don't think I'm...

1244
01:26:35,034 --> 01:26:36,744
So, that's what it does.

1245
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:41,950
<i>All hands
to crash stations immediately.</i>

1246
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:10,566
Cap, hit the lever.

1247
01:27:10,946 --> 01:27:13,520
I need a minute here!

1248
01:27:13,658 --> 01:27:14,737
Lever

1249
01:27:14,867 --> 01:27:15,982
now!

1250
01:27:27,963 --> 01:27:29,078
<i>Help!</i>

1251
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:06,085
Sorry, boss.

1252
01:28:06,212 --> 01:28:07,920
The god rabbited.

1253
01:28:08,047 --> 01:28:09,506
Just stay awake.

1254
01:28:09,632 --> 01:28:11,256
Eyes on me.

1255
01:28:11,383 --> 01:28:12,925
No, I'm clocking out here.

1256
01:28:13,051 --> 01:28:14,546
Not an option.

1257
01:28:15,554 --> 01:28:17,511
It's okay, boss.

1258
01:28:19,433 --> 01:28:21,473
This was never gonna work

1259
01:28:21,602 --> 01:28:22,883
if they didn't have something

1260
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:25,772
to...

1261
01:28:54,887 --> 01:28:56,714
<i>Agent Coulson is down.</i>

1262
01:28:58,098 --> 01:28:59,806
<i>A medical team is on
its way to your location.</i>

1263
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:01,393
<i>They're here.</i>

1264
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:06,229
<i>They called it.</i>

1265
01:29:22,707 --> 01:29:24,332
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1266
01:29:27,671 --> 01:29:29,794
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

1267
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:34,961
We're dead in the air up here.

1268
01:29:35,094 --> 01:29:38,179
Our communications,
the location of the Cube,

1269
01:29:38,306 --> 01:29:40,714
Banner, Thor...

1270
01:29:42,018 --> 01:29:43,928
I got nothing for you.

1271
01:29:44,062 --> 01:29:46,980
I lost my one good eye.

1272
01:29:50,027 --> 01:29:53,028
Maybe I had that coming.

1273
01:29:57,243 --> 01:29:58,523
Yes,

1274
01:29:59,703 --> 01:30:03,037
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1275
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,409
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1276
01:30:06,543 --> 01:30:09,580
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1277
01:30:13,551 --> 01:30:17,679
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1278
01:30:19,557 --> 01:30:22,891
called the Avengers Initiative.

1279
01:30:24,104 --> 01:30:26,226
The idea was to bring together a group

1280
01:30:26,355 --> 01:30:28,893
of remarkable people

1281
01:30:29,692 --> 01:30:32,527
to see if they could become
something more.

1282
01:30:33,905 --> 01:30:38,069
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1283
01:30:38,201 --> 01:30:41,535
to fight the battles that we never could.

1284
01:30:44,291 --> 01:30:49,119
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1285
01:30:51,465 --> 01:30:53,126
In heroes.

1286
01:31:01,225 --> 01:31:02,767
Well,

1287
01:31:03,644 --> 01:31:06,314
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1288
01:31:26,626 --> 01:31:29,117
<i>You fell out of the sky.</i>

1289
01:31:43,144 --> 01:31:44,638
Did I hurt anybody?

1290
01:31:44,770 --> 01:31:47,806
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1291
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:51,225
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

1292
01:31:52,069 --> 01:31:53,100
Lucky.

1293
01:31:53,237 --> 01:31:54,861
Or just good aim.

1294
01:31:54,989 --> 01:31:56,566
You were awake when you fell.

1295
01:31:58,659 --> 01:32:00,699
- You saw?
- The whole thing.

1296
01:32:00,828 --> 01:32:02,453
Right through the ceiling.

1297
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:06,530
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1298
01:32:06,668 --> 01:32:07,782
Here.

1299
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:11,329
Didn't think those would
fit you until you shrunk down

1300
01:32:11,464 --> 01:32:13,872
to a regular-size feller.

1301
01:32:16,219 --> 01:32:17,499
Thank you.

1302
01:32:18,513 --> 01:32:19,758
Are you an alien?

1303
01:32:20,348 --> 01:32:21,546
What?

1304
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:23,178
From outer space, an alien.

1305
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:24,806
No.

1306
01:32:25,186 --> 01:32:28,306
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1307
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,484
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1308
01:32:44,831 --> 01:32:46,908
You know that?

1309
01:32:47,751 --> 01:32:49,625
Is that what you know?

1310
01:32:52,089 --> 01:32:54,960
I've got no window.

1311
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,136
I have to flush him out.

1312
01:32:58,054 --> 01:32:59,881
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

1313
01:33:00,014 --> 01:33:01,557
You don't understand.

1314
01:33:03,518 --> 01:33:06,768
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1315
01:33:07,564 --> 01:33:11,727
Pull you out
and stuff something else in?

1316
01:33:14,904 --> 01:33:17,277
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

1317
01:33:18,825 --> 01:33:21,197
You know that I do.

1318
01:33:28,794 --> 01:33:29,825
Why am I back?

1319
01:33:30,963 --> 01:33:32,338
How did you get him out?

1320
01:33:32,465 --> 01:33:35,300
Cognitive recalibration.

1321
01:33:35,426 --> 01:33:38,130
I hit you really hard on the head.

1322
01:33:38,262 --> 01:33:39,341
Thanks.

1323
01:33:43,642 --> 01:33:45,386
Natasha...

1324
01:33:46,062 --> 01:33:47,141
How many agents did I...

1325
01:33:47,271 --> 01:33:48,730
Don't.

1326
01:33:48,856 --> 01:33:51,063
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1327
01:33:51,651 --> 01:33:53,359
This is Loki.

1328
01:33:53,486 --> 01:33:56,108
This is monsters and magic,

1329
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:57,864
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1330
01:33:57,991 --> 01:33:59,533
Loki, did he get away?

1331
01:33:59,659 --> 01:34:00,655
Yeah.

1332
01:34:00,994 --> 01:34:03,235
I don't suppose you know where.

1333
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:05,162
I didn't need to know.

1334
01:34:05,289 --> 01:34:07,033
I didn't ask.

1335
01:34:10,295 --> 01:34:12,786
He's going to
make his play soon, though.

1336
01:34:13,131 --> 01:34:14,127
Today.

1337
01:34:14,257 --> 01:34:15,586
We got to stop him.

1338
01:34:16,259 --> 01:34:17,504
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1339
01:34:17,636 --> 01:34:19,593
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1340
01:34:20,806 --> 01:34:22,134
Well,

1341
01:34:23,851 --> 01:34:26,009
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

1342
01:34:26,145 --> 01:34:28,850
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1343
01:34:31,692 --> 01:34:33,269
Now you sound like you.

1344
01:34:33,986 --> 01:34:35,445
But you don't.

1345
01:34:37,364 --> 01:34:40,200
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1346
01:34:40,326 --> 01:34:45,071
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1347
01:34:46,833 --> 01:34:48,790
What did Loki do to you?

1348
01:34:49,544 --> 01:34:51,952
He didn't. I just...

1349
01:34:55,717 --> 01:34:57,258
Natasha.

1350
01:34:59,345 --> 01:35:01,338
I've been compromised.

1351
01:35:04,434 --> 01:35:06,557
I got red in my ledger.

1352
01:35:08,688 --> 01:35:10,765
I would like to wipe it out.

1353
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:28,284
Was he married?

1354
01:35:28,417 --> 01:35:29,828
No.

1355
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:34,172
There was a cellist, I think.

1356
01:35:35,758 --> 01:35:37,169
I'm sorry.

1357
01:35:37,885 --> 01:35:39,545
He seemed like a good man.

1358
01:35:40,847 --> 01:35:41,926
He was an idiot.

1359
01:35:42,056 --> 01:35:44,298
Why? For believing?

1360
01:35:44,434 --> 01:35:45,845
For taking on Loki alone.

1361
01:35:45,977 --> 01:35:47,685
He was doing his job.

1362
01:35:47,813 --> 01:35:50,351
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

1363
01:35:50,482 --> 01:35:51,512
He should have...

1364
01:35:51,649 --> 01:35:53,227
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1365
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:55,482
Right, I've heard that before.

1366
01:35:55,611 --> 01:35:57,106
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1367
01:35:57,238 --> 01:35:59,030
We are not soldiers.

1368
01:36:03,495 --> 01:36:05,238
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1369
01:36:05,372 --> 01:36:06,535
Neither am I.

1370
01:36:06,665 --> 01:36:08,871
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

1371
01:36:09,001 --> 01:36:10,376
But right now,
we got to put that behind us

1372
01:36:10,502 --> 01:36:12,709
and get this done.

1373
01:36:12,838 --> 01:36:13,834
Loki needs a power source.

1374
01:36:13,964 --> 01:36:14,960
If we can put together a list...

1375
01:36:15,091 --> 01:36:16,086
He made it personal.

1376
01:36:16,259 --> 01:36:17,290
That's not the point.

1377
01:36:17,426 --> 01:36:19,798
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1378
01:36:19,928 --> 01:36:21,837
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1379
01:36:21,972 --> 01:36:22,968
To tear us apart.

1380
01:36:23,098 --> 01:36:24,972
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1381
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:27,556
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

1382
01:36:27,686 --> 01:36:29,229
That's what he wants.

1383
01:36:29,355 --> 01:36:31,846
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1384
01:36:31,983 --> 01:36:33,097
He wants an audience.

1385
01:36:33,818 --> 01:36:35,478
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1386
01:36:35,612 --> 01:36:38,529
Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.

1387
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:41,195
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1388
01:36:41,326 --> 01:36:42,904
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1389
01:36:43,036 --> 01:36:46,819
He wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered...

1390
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:50,160
Son of a bitch.

1391
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:02,461
Time to go.

1392
01:37:02,598 --> 01:37:04,140
- Go where?
- I'll tell you on the way.

1393
01:37:04,266 --> 01:37:05,262
Can you fly one of those jets?

1394
01:37:06,852 --> 01:37:08,097
I can.

1395
01:37:11,982 --> 01:37:13,013
You got a suit?

1396
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:14,145
Yeah.

1397
01:37:14,276 --> 01:37:15,735
Then suit up.

1398
01:37:43,389 --> 01:37:44,670
Hey, you guys aren't
authorised to be in here.

1399
01:37:44,807 --> 01:37:47,133
Son, just don't.

1400
01:37:49,187 --> 01:37:50,183
Sir.

1401
01:37:50,313 --> 01:37:51,511
Agent Hill.

1402
01:37:52,065 --> 01:37:53,607
Those cards,

1403
01:37:55,736 --> 01:38:00,197
they were in Coulson's locker,
not in his jacket.

1404
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:06,197
They needed the push.

1405
01:38:09,291 --> 01:38:11,580
<i>We have an unauthorised departure
from Bay 6.</i>

1406
01:38:12,461 --> 01:38:13,789
They found him.

1407
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:18,331
Get our communications back up,
whatever you have to do.

1408
01:38:18,467 --> 01:38:20,709
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes, sir.

1409
01:38:34,275 --> 01:38:36,018
<i>Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor</i>

1410
01:38:36,152 --> 01:38:39,984
<i>but the device
is already self-sustaining.</i>

1411
01:38:40,114 --> 01:38:42,273
<i>Shut it down, Dr Selvig.</i>

1412
01:38:42,951 --> 01:38:44,231
It's too late!

1413
01:38:46,288 --> 01:38:47,747
She can't stop now.

1414
01:38:48,790 --> 01:38:51,246
She wants to show us something!

1415
01:38:51,377 --> 01:38:53,416
A new universe.

1416
01:38:53,545 --> 01:38:55,088
<i>Okay.</i>

1417
01:39:02,137 --> 01:39:04,011
<i>The barrier is pure energy.</i>

1418
01:39:04,139 --> 01:39:06,013
<i>It's unbreachable.</i>

1419
01:39:06,141 --> 01:39:07,933
<i>Yeah, I got that.</i>

1420
01:39:09,144 --> 01:39:10,140
<i>Plan B.</i>

1421
01:39:11,313 --> 01:39:13,390
<i>Sir, the Mark 7
is not ready for deployment.</i>

1422
01:39:13,524 --> 01:39:15,766
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

1423
01:39:35,505 --> 01:39:38,542
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

1424
01:39:39,676 --> 01:39:42,048
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1425
01:39:42,179 --> 01:39:43,638
You should have left
your armour on for that.

1426
01:39:43,764 --> 01:39:45,175
Yeah.

1427
01:39:45,307 --> 01:39:46,386
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1428
01:39:46,517 --> 01:39:49,138
and you've got
the glow stick of destiny.

1429
01:39:49,937 --> 01:39:52,226
Would you like a drink?

1430
01:39:52,356 --> 01:39:53,471
Stalling me won't change anything.

1431
01:39:53,608 --> 01:39:55,730
No, no. Threatening.

1432
01:39:55,859 --> 01:39:57,234
No drink? Are you sure?

1433
01:39:57,361 --> 01:39:58,903
I'm having one.

1434
01:39:59,947 --> 01:40:03,861
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

1435
01:40:04,744 --> 01:40:06,154
What have I to fear?

1436
01:40:06,287 --> 01:40:07,995
The Avengers.

1437
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:12,408
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

1438
01:40:12,544 --> 01:40:14,168
"Earth's mightiest heroes"-type thing.

1439
01:40:14,295 --> 01:40:16,169
Yes, I've met them.

1440
01:40:16,298 --> 01:40:17,329
Yeah.

1441
01:40:17,465 --> 01:40:18,628
It takes us a while to get any traction,

1442
01:40:18,758 --> 01:40:19,754
I'll give you that one.

1443
01:40:19,885 --> 01:40:22,090
But let's do a head count, here.

1444
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:24,711
Your brother, the demigod,

1445
01:40:26,432 --> 01:40:30,015
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend.

1446
01:40:30,145 --> 01:40:33,312
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

1447
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,524
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella,

1448
01:40:37,152 --> 01:40:40,106
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

1449
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:41,235
That was the plan.

1450
01:40:41,365 --> 01:40:43,358
Not a great plan.

1451
01:40:43,492 --> 01:40:45,532
When they come,

1452
01:40:45,661 --> 01:40:47,120
and they will,

1453
01:40:47,246 --> 01:40:48,490
they'll come for you.

1454
01:40:48,622 --> 01:40:49,618
I have an army.

1455
01:40:49,748 --> 01:40:50,911
We have a Hulk.

1456
01:40:51,416 --> 01:40:52,792
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1457
01:40:52,918 --> 01:40:54,827
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

1458
01:40:54,962 --> 01:40:58,960
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

1459
01:40:59,091 --> 01:41:01,417
Maybe your army comes
and maybe it's too much for us,

1460
01:41:01,552 --> 01:41:03,545
but it's all on you.

1461
01:41:04,347 --> 01:41:05,426
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1462
01:41:05,598 --> 01:41:08,718
you can be damn well sure
we'll avenge it.

1463
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:13,807
How will your friends have time for me

1464
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:15,731
when they are so busy fighting you?

1465
01:41:23,158 --> 01:41:24,189
This usually works.

1466
01:41:24,325 --> 01:41:27,161
Well, performance issues,
it's not uncommon.

1467
01:41:27,287 --> 01:41:29,196
One out of five...

1468
01:41:30,666 --> 01:41:31,208
Jarvis, anytime now.

1469
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:33,580
Jarvis, anytime now.

1470
01:41:35,337 --> 01:41:38,089
You will all fall before me.

1471
01:41:38,215 --> 01:41:39,591
Deploy!

1472
01:41:39,717 --> 01:41:41,128
Deploy!

1473
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:11,283
<i>And there's one other
person you pissed off.</i>

1474
01:42:12,417 --> 01:42:13,662
<i>His name was Phil.</i>

1475
01:42:37,442 --> 01:42:38,937
Right.

1476
01:42:39,069 --> 01:42:40,314
Army.

1477
01:43:52,687 --> 01:43:53,968
Loki!

1478
01:43:54,105 --> 01:43:56,145
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1479
01:43:56,274 --> 01:43:57,306
You can't.

1480
01:43:57,442 --> 01:43:59,315
There is no stopping it.

1481
01:43:59,443 --> 01:44:01,235
There is only

1482
01:44:01,362 --> 01:44:02,477
the war.

1483
01:44:02,613 --> 01:44:03,728
So be it.

1484
01:44:25,846 --> 01:44:27,589
<i>Stark, we're on your three,
headed northeast.</i>

1485
01:44:27,723 --> 01:44:29,846
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1486
01:44:29,975 --> 01:44:31,683
Swing up Park. I'm going
to lay them out for you.

1487
01:44:49,746 --> 01:44:51,075
<i>Sir, we have more incoming.</i>

1488
01:44:51,206 --> 01:44:52,949
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1489
01:44:59,839 --> 01:45:01,713
- Nat?
- I see him.

1490
01:45:46,053 --> 01:45:48,260
We got to get back up there.

1491
01:46:39,609 --> 01:46:41,269
Stark, are you seeing this?

1492
01:46:42,028 --> 01:46:44,483
<i>Seeing. Still working on believing.</i>

1493
01:46:44,614 --> 01:46:45,989
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?

1494
01:46:46,115 --> 01:46:47,147
<i>Banner?</i>

1495
01:46:47,283 --> 01:46:48,315
Just keep me posted.

1496
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:51,194
<i>Jarvis, find me a soft spot.</i>

1497
01:46:53,457 --> 01:46:55,330
Look at this!

1498
01:46:55,459 --> 01:46:56,455
Look around you!

1499
01:46:57,461 --> 01:47:01,329
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

1500
01:47:01,465 --> 01:47:02,959
It's too late.

1501
01:47:04,468 --> 01:47:05,713
It's too late to stop it.

1502
01:47:05,845 --> 01:47:09,711
No. We can, together.

1503
01:47:16,313 --> 01:47:18,436
Sentiment.

1504
01:47:46,011 --> 01:47:48,549
We've got civilians
still trapped up here.

1505
01:47:49,723 --> 01:47:50,719
Loki.

1506
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:04,152
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1507
01:48:09,618 --> 01:48:11,576
We got this. It's good. Go.

1508
01:48:11,704 --> 01:48:13,079
Do you think you can hold them off?

1509
01:48:13,205 --> 01:48:14,201
Captain,

1510
01:48:16,209 --> 01:48:19,044
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1511
01:48:45,906 --> 01:48:47,614
Just like Budapest all over again.

1512
01:48:48,242 --> 01:48:50,733
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

1513
01:49:06,886 --> 01:49:07,882
It's going to be an hour

1514
01:49:08,012 --> 01:49:09,292
before they can
scramble the National Guard.

1515
01:49:09,430 --> 01:49:11,222
National Guard?

1516
01:49:12,183 --> 01:49:13,677
Does the army know
what's happening here?

1517
01:49:13,935 --> 01:49:14,931
Do we?

1518
01:49:16,146 --> 01:49:17,344
You need men in these buildings.

1519
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:18,975
There are people inside and
they're going to be running

1520
01:49:19,107 --> 01:49:20,305
right into the line of fire.

1521
01:49:20,442 --> 01:49:22,351
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

1522
01:49:22,485 --> 01:49:24,062
You keep them off the streets.

1523
01:49:24,195 --> 01:49:26,816
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1524
01:49:26,948 --> 01:49:28,572
Why the hell
should I take orders from you?

1525
01:49:42,631 --> 01:49:43,829
I need men in those buildings.

1526
01:49:43,966 --> 01:49:46,042
Lead the people down
and away from the streets.

1527
01:49:46,177 --> 01:49:48,750
We're going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

1528
01:49:59,148 --> 01:50:00,726
Well, we got its attention.

1529
01:50:00,858 --> 01:50:02,732
<i>What the hell was step two?</i>

1530
01:50:32,266 --> 01:50:33,261
What's the story upstairs?

1531
01:50:33,392 --> 01:50:35,301
The power surrounding the Cube
is impenetrable.

1532
01:50:35,436 --> 01:50:38,057
<i>Thor's right. We got
to deal with these guys.</i>

1533
01:50:38,189 --> 01:50:39,813
- How do we do this?
- As a team.

1534
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:41,221
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1535
01:50:41,776 --> 01:50:42,807
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1536
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,938
Save it.

1537
01:50:44,069 --> 01:50:45,397
Loki's going to keep
this fight focused on us,

1538
01:50:45,529 --> 01:50:46,560
and that's what we need.

1539
01:50:46,697 --> 01:50:48,357
Without him,
these things could run wild.

1540
01:50:48,490 --> 01:50:51,444
We got Stark up top.
He's going to need us to...

1541
01:50:58,793 --> 01:51:02,577
So, this all seems horrible.

1542
01:51:03,047 --> 01:51:04,162
I've seen worse.

1543
01:51:04,716 --> 01:51:05,712
Sorry.

1544
01:51:05,842 --> 01:51:08,512
No, we could use a little worse.

1545
01:51:08,637 --> 01:51:11,044
<i>- Stark, we got him.
- Banner?</i>

1546
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:12,425
Just like you said.

1547
01:51:12,557 --> 01:51:15,262
Then tell him to suit up.
I'm bringing the party to you.

1548
01:51:21,733 --> 01:51:23,809
I don't see how that's a party.

1549
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:32,656
Dr Banner.

1550
01:51:34,413 --> 01:51:36,205
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

1551
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:39,704
That's my secret, Captain.

1552
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:42,665
I'm always angry.

1553
01:51:54,142 --> 01:51:55,766
<i>Hold on!</i>

1554
01:52:25,674 --> 01:52:27,217
Send the rest.

1555
01:52:33,974 --> 01:52:35,219
Guys.

1556
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:36,548
<i>Call it, Captain.</i>

1557
01:52:36,685 --> 01:52:37,848
All right, listen up.

1558
01:52:37,978 --> 01:52:40,765
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

1559
01:52:40,898 --> 01:52:42,226
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1560
01:52:42,358 --> 01:52:44,232
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

1561
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:45,735
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1562
01:52:45,862 --> 01:52:47,024
Anything gets
more than three blocks out,

1563
01:52:47,155 --> 01:52:48,697
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1564
01:52:48,823 --> 01:52:50,021
<i>- Can you give me a lift?
- Right.</i>

1565
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:51,237
<i>Better clench up, Legolas.</i>

1566
01:52:54,829 --> 01:52:57,202
Thor, you got to try
and bottleneck that portal.

1567
01:52:57,332 --> 01:52:58,495
Slow them down.

1568
01:52:58,625 --> 01:53:00,783
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

1569
01:53:03,087 --> 01:53:04,712
You and me,
we stay here on the ground.

1570
01:53:04,839 --> 01:53:05,870
We keep the fighting here.

1571
01:53:06,007 --> 01:53:07,003
And Hulk...

1572
01:53:09,719 --> 01:53:10,799
Smash.

1573
01:54:04,401 --> 01:54:05,515
Sir.

1574
01:54:06,570 --> 01:54:07,566
The Council is on.

1575
01:54:12,451 --> 01:54:15,701
Stark, you got a lot of strays
sniffing your tail.

1576
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:19,579
I'm just trying to keep them
off the streets.

1577
01:54:19,709 --> 01:54:21,950
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1578
01:54:22,085 --> 01:54:23,248
So find a tight corner.

1579
01:54:23,378 --> 01:54:24,707
I will roger that.

1580
01:54:47,695 --> 01:54:48,858
Oh, boy.

1581
01:54:55,870 --> 01:54:57,495
Nice call.

1582
01:54:57,622 --> 01:54:58,820
What else you got?

1583
01:54:58,957 --> 01:55:01,744
<i>Thor is taking on
a squadron down on Sixth.</i>

1584
01:55:01,877 --> 01:55:04,083
And he didn't invite me.

1585
01:55:43,586 --> 01:55:45,211
Captain, none of this
is going to mean a damn thing

1586
01:55:45,338 --> 01:55:46,583
if we don't close that portal.

1587
01:55:46,714 --> 01:55:48,374
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1588
01:55:48,508 --> 01:55:50,750
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1589
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:54,636
If you want to get up there,
you're going to need a ride.

1590
01:55:55,724 --> 01:55:56,803
I got a ride.

1591
01:55:57,935 --> 01:55:58,966
I could use a boost, though.

1592
01:56:01,563 --> 01:56:02,559
Are you sure about this?

1593
01:56:03,023 --> 01:56:05,562
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1594
01:56:32,596 --> 01:56:34,470
Okay, turn, turn.

1595
01:56:34,598 --> 01:56:36,340
Less! Less!

1596
01:57:59,059 --> 01:58:02,013
<i>Captain, the bank
on 42nd past Madison.</i>

1597
01:58:02,146 --> 01:58:03,889
<i>They've cornered
a lot of civilians in there.</i>

1598
01:58:04,023 --> 01:58:05,932
I'm on it.

1599
01:58:26,045 --> 01:58:27,837
Everyone! Clear out!

1600
01:58:57,745 --> 01:58:59,405
<i>Director Fury,</i>

1601
01:58:59,538 --> 01:59:01,330
<i>the Council has made a decision.</i>

1602
01:59:01,457 --> 01:59:04,209
I recognise the Council
has made a decision.

1603
01:59:04,335 --> 01:59:05,913
But given that
it's a stupid-ass decision,

1604
01:59:06,045 --> 01:59:07,456
I have elected to ignore it.

1605
01:59:07,588 --> 01:59:10,922
<i>Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.</i>

1606
01:59:11,050 --> 01:59:12,046
<i>You scramble that jet...</i>

1607
01:59:12,177 --> 01:59:14,882
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

1608
01:59:15,013 --> 01:59:17,089
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1609
01:59:17,224 --> 01:59:19,180
I will not order a nuclear strike

1610
01:59:19,350 --> 01:59:20,761
against a civilian population.

1611
01:59:20,893 --> 01:59:23,301
<i>If we don't hold them here,
we lose everything.</i>

1612
01:59:23,438 --> 01:59:26,190
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1613
01:59:29,945 --> 01:59:31,653
You.

1614
01:59:33,907 --> 01:59:35,070
Hawkeye!

1615
01:59:36,535 --> 01:59:37,531
Nat, what are you doing?

1616
01:59:38,454 --> 01:59:39,450
A little help?

1617
01:59:44,751 --> 01:59:45,747
I got him.

1618
02:00:12,321 --> 02:00:13,317
Enough!

1619
02:00:13,656 --> 02:00:16,112
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1620
02:00:16,242 --> 02:00:18,994
I am a god, you dull creature.

1621
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:20,614
And I will not be bullied by...

1622
02:00:30,466 --> 02:00:32,339
Puny god.

1623
02:00:40,475 --> 02:00:41,934
The sceptre...

1624
02:00:43,103 --> 02:00:44,301
Doctor.

1625
02:00:46,190 --> 02:00:49,025
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1626
02:00:49,151 --> 02:00:50,811
The Tesseract can't fight,

1627
02:00:50,945 --> 02:00:52,984
but you can't protect against yourself.

1628
02:00:53,114 --> 02:00:54,110
It's not your fault.

1629
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:55,485
You didn't know what you were doing.

1630
02:00:58,536 --> 02:01:00,695
Actually, I think I did.

1631
02:01:00,830 --> 02:01:03,785
I built in a safety
to cut their power source.

1632
02:01:05,001 --> 02:01:06,411
Loki's sceptre.

1633
02:01:06,544 --> 02:01:09,117
It may be able to close the portal.

1634
02:01:11,215 --> 02:01:13,374
And I'm looking right at it.

1635
02:01:25,356 --> 02:01:29,223
<i>Sir, we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell.</i>

1636
02:01:35,866 --> 02:01:39,152
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1637
02:01:39,286 --> 02:01:41,658
<i>I wouldn't consider him a role model.</i>

1638
02:02:51,278 --> 02:02:53,069
<i>Director Fury is no longer in command.</i>

1639
02:02:53,196 --> 02:02:55,235
<i>Override order 7-Alpha- 1- 1.</i>

1640
02:02:55,364 --> 02:02:57,938
<i>7- Alpha- 1- 1, confirmed.
We're go for takeoff.</i>

1641
02:02:58,826 --> 02:03:00,903
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1642
02:03:01,412 --> 02:03:03,405
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

1643
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:04,820
We need to shut it down!

1644
02:03:04,958 --> 02:03:07,164
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

1645
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:39,859
Stark, do you hear me?

1646
02:03:39,994 --> 02:03:42,117
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

1647
02:03:42,664 --> 02:03:44,039
<i>How long?</i>

1648
02:03:44,165 --> 02:03:46,242
<i>Three minutes, max.</i>

1649
02:03:46,376 --> 02:03:48,001
<i>The payload will wipe out Midtown.</i>

1650
02:03:48,128 --> 02:03:50,167
Jarvis, put everything we got
into the thrusters.

1651
02:03:50,296 --> 02:03:51,956
<i>I just did.</i>

1652
02:04:04,853 --> 02:04:06,182
<i>Package is sent.</i>

1653
02:04:06,313 --> 02:04:09,433
<i>Detonation in
2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.</i>

1654
02:04:32,215 --> 02:04:34,587
Are you ready for another bout?

1655
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:36,291
What, are you getting sleepy?

1656
02:04:41,892 --> 02:04:43,634
Right at the crown!

1657
02:04:49,649 --> 02:04:51,441
I can close it.

1658
02:04:51,568 --> 02:04:53,607
Can anybody copy?

1659
02:04:53,737 --> 02:04:54,851
I can shut the portal down.

1660
02:04:54,988 --> 02:04:57,028
<i>- Do it!
- No, wait.</i>

1661
02:04:57,157 --> 02:04:58,402
Stark, these things are still coming.

1662
02:04:58,534 --> 02:04:59,529
I got a nuke coming in.

1663
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:01,569
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1664
02:05:11,254 --> 02:05:13,081
And I know just where to put it.

1665
02:05:20,264 --> 02:05:22,636
<i>Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.</i>

1666
02:05:22,767 --> 02:05:24,142
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1667
02:05:24,268 --> 02:05:28,349
<i>Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?</i>

1668
02:05:28,481 --> 02:05:30,521
Might as well.

1669
02:05:32,444 --> 02:05:34,816
<i>The streets of New York City
have become a battleground.</i>

1670
02:05:34,946 --> 02:05:37,650
<i>The Army is here trying
to contain the violence</i>

1671
02:05:37,782 --> 02:05:39,241
<i>but clearly, it is outmatched.</i>

1672
02:05:39,367 --> 02:05:41,656
<i>And I have to say,
in all my years of reporting,</i>

1673
02:05:41,786 --> 02:05:44,704
<i>I have never seen anything like this.</i>

1674
02:05:44,831 --> 02:05:46,325
<i>We have limited information
on the team</i>

1675
02:05:46,458 --> 02:05:50,206
<i>but we do know that
billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...</i>

1676
02:07:03,537 --> 02:07:05,364
Come on, Stark.

1677
02:07:12,004 --> 02:07:13,119
Close it.

1678
02:07:33,193 --> 02:07:34,189
Son of a gun.

1679
02:07:38,949 --> 02:07:40,573
He's not slowing down.

1680
02:07:58,635 --> 02:08:00,094
Is he breathing?

1681
02:08:27,957 --> 02:08:29,368
What the hell?

1682
02:08:32,087 --> 02:08:34,210
What just happened?

1683
02:08:34,339 --> 02:08:36,628
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1684
02:08:40,930 --> 02:08:42,590
We won.

1685
02:08:44,934 --> 02:08:46,213
All right, yay!

1686
02:08:46,351 --> 02:08:48,308
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1687
02:08:48,437 --> 02:08:51,640
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.

1688
02:08:52,524 --> 02:08:54,102
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1689
02:08:54,527 --> 02:08:56,815
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1690
02:08:56,946 --> 02:08:58,606
I don't know what it is,
but I want to try it.

1691
02:08:59,031 --> 02:09:00,490
We're not finished yet.

1692
02:09:05,455 --> 02:09:07,578
And then shawarma after.

1693
02:09:29,229 --> 02:09:31,471
If it's all the same to you,

1694
02:09:34,777 --> 02:09:36,437
I'll have that drink now.

1695
02:09:44,328 --> 02:09:46,367
<i>Despite the devastation
of what has been confirmed</i>

1696
02:09:46,497 --> 02:09:48,205
<i>as an extraterrestrial attack,</i>

1697
02:09:48,332 --> 02:09:49,874
<i>the extraordinary heroics</i>

1698
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,958
<i>of the group known as the Avengers</i>

1699
02:09:52,086 --> 02:09:53,628
<i>has been to many a cause
not only for comfort,</i>

1700
02:09:53,754 --> 02:09:54,750
<i>but for celebration.</i>

1701
02:09:54,881 --> 02:09:57,288
<i>It's just really great knowing
they're out there.</i>

1702
02:09:57,425 --> 02:09:59,216
<i>That someone is watching over us.</i>

1703
02:09:59,344 --> 02:10:00,542
<i>I love you, Thor!</i>

1704
02:10:00,678 --> 02:10:02,387
<i>And then these guys were like...</i>

1705
02:10:02,514 --> 02:10:03,842
<i>And then the air goes...</i>

1706
02:10:03,974 --> 02:10:05,349
<i>And this green guy walks up
and he goes...</i>

1707
02:10:05,475 --> 02:10:06,507
<i>I don't know.</i>

1708
02:10:06,643 --> 02:10:09,098
<i>I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.</i>

1709
02:10:09,228 --> 02:10:12,313
<i>It just seems that there's
a lot they're not telling us.</i>

1710
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:15,856
<i>Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.</i>

1711
02:10:15,985 --> 02:10:17,895
<i>These so-called "heroes"</i>

1712
02:10:18,029 --> 02:10:19,310
<i>have to be held responsible</i>

1713
02:10:19,448 --> 02:10:21,606
<i>for the destruction done to this city.</i>

1714
02:10:21,742 --> 02:10:23,865
<i>This was their fight.
Where are they now?</i>

1715
02:10:23,994 --> 02:10:24,495
<i>Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.</i>

1716
02:10:24,495 --> 02:10:26,820
<i>Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.</i>

1717
02:10:26,956 --> 02:10:27,951
<i>Their sudden appearance</i>

1718
02:10:28,082 --> 02:10:29,457
<i>and equally sudden disappearance...</i>

1719
02:10:29,583 --> 02:10:32,371
<i>What, this is all somehow their fault?</i>

1720
02:10:34,421 --> 02:10:37,588
<i>Captain America saved my life.</i>

1721
02:10:39,718 --> 02:10:43,218
<i>Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,</i>

1722
02:10:43,347 --> 02:10:44,841
<i>I would just...</i>

1723
02:10:45,641 --> 02:10:47,930
<i>I would want to say thank you.</i>

1724
02:10:50,396 --> 02:10:51,891
<i>Where are the Avengers?</i>

1725
02:10:52,023 --> 02:10:54,431
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

1726
02:10:54,567 --> 02:10:56,726
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

1727
02:10:56,861 --> 02:10:58,439
<i>And the Tesseract?</i>

1728
02:10:58,572 --> 02:11:00,814
<i>The Tesseract is where it belongs.</i>

1729
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:03,566
<i>Out of our reach.</i>

1730
02:11:03,701 --> 02:11:05,243
<i>That's not your call.</i>

1731
02:11:05,370 --> 02:11:06,401
I didn't make it.

1732
02:11:06,537 --> 02:11:08,779
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1733
02:11:08,915 --> 02:11:10,706
<i>So, you let him take it</i>

1734
02:11:10,834 --> 02:11:12,458
<i>and the war criminal, Loki,</i>

1735
02:11:12,586 --> 02:11:14,294
<i>who should be
answering for his crime.</i>

1736
02:11:14,421 --> 02:11:16,994
<i>I think he will be.</i>

1737
02:11:30,479 --> 02:11:33,148
<i>I don't think you understand
what you've started,</i>

1738
02:11:33,273 --> 02:11:35,729
<i>letting the Avengers
loose on this world.</i>

1739
02:11:36,277 --> 02:11:37,272
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

1740
02:11:37,403 --> 02:11:41,068
<i>They surely are,
and the whole world knows it.</i>

1741
02:11:41,616 --> 02:11:44,189
Every world knows it.

1742
02:11:44,619 --> 02:11:46,695
<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>

1743
02:11:46,829 --> 02:11:48,573
<i>A statement?</i>

1744
02:11:51,293 --> 02:11:52,751
<i>A promise.</i>

1745
02:12:01,469 --> 02:12:03,011
<i>Sir, how does it work now?</i>

1746
02:12:04,139 --> 02:12:06,131
They've gone their separate ways.

1747
02:12:06,266 --> 02:12:09,184
Some, pretty extremely far.

1748
02:12:09,936 --> 02:12:11,846
If we get into a situation like this again,

1749
02:12:11,980 --> 02:12:13,523
what happens then?

1750
02:12:13,649 --> 02:12:14,645
They'll come back.

1751
02:12:16,151 --> 02:12:17,860
Are you really sure about that?

1752
02:12:17,987 --> 02:12:18,983
I am.

1753
02:12:20,615 --> 02:12:21,813
Why?

1754
02:12:22,866 --> 02:12:25,072
Because we'll need them to.

1755
02:15:16,671 --> 02:15:19,162
Humans.

1756
02:15:20,466 --> 02:15:24,796
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

1757
02:15:25,764 --> 02:15:27,922
They stand.

1758
02:15:28,767 --> 02:15:35,220
They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.

1759
02:15:42,197 --> 02:15:45,068
To challenge them

1760
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:48,901
is to court death.
