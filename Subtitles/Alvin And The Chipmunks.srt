1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:46,548
It's going. It's going.

3
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:49,915
And it's gone.

4
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:51,282
Whatever.

5
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,783
Maybe we should take a break.

6
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:57,827
That's it. I can't take this anymore.

7
00:01:57,996 --> 00:01:59,520
I can't. I give up.

8
00:01:59,697 --> 00:02:01,961
I'm sick of struggling for survival.

9
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,660
Competing with gophers and
earthworms and that loser sparrow...

10
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:07,702
...who always takes my nuts.

11
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:09,931
And I'm especially sick of this stupid...

12
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:12,838
...stupid tree.

13
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:16,480
- What's happening?
- Guys.

14
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:19,310
I think he made it angry.

15
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:24,345
I'm awake.

16
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,043
I'm up...

17
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:28,879
...and I'm late.

18
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,390
Demo. Dave Seville.

19
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:50,070
Keys. Bag.

20
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:52,403
Pants.

21
00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:54,545
I need pants. Pants are essential.

22
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,586
Claire.

23
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,947
- Dave.
- Hey.

24
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:06,988
How's it going?

25
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:10,121
I haven't seen you since...

26
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:12,991
Well, since you said you never wanted
to see me again.

27
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:14,324
So I guess it worked.

28
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:15,898
What a fun day that was.

29
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:18,934
Let me guess.
You're late for something again.

30
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:21,731
- Same old Dave.
- Not following you.

31
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:24,898
You know,
the guy who's always fooling around...

32
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:27,510
...who can't handle
a serious relationship.

33
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:28,736
That was the old Dave.

34
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:31,347
How about we get together,
talk about the new Dave?

35
00:04:31,816 --> 00:04:33,408
Tomorrow night. My place.

36
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:35,446
- I...
- Great.

37
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,783
- No...
- You look good, Claire.

38
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,307
Where are we?

39
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:35,412
Well, I think they remodeled our forest.
I like it. Stylish, yet functional.

40
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:37,478
Where did the mountains go?

41
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:41,278
Give me a break.
We're in a building, Theodore.

42
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:45,984
Dave.

43
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:50,151
- Ian.
- Hey, big guy.

44
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:53,260
Hey, you ever seen the view
from the 80th floor?

45
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:57,367
- No. They never let me past the lobby.
- What? I can't...

46
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:00,368
Hey, back off, man,
this is Dave Seville.

47
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:08,673
Mr. Seville, can I offer you
some muffins, scones, pastries?

48
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:10,677
No. I'd hate to be a bother.

49
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:12,907
It's no problem.
We have an omelet station.

50
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:14,517
Omelet station.

51
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:16,950
Can I get you some water
or a soy latte?

52
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:19,351
How about a shot
of wheatgrass juice?

53
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:21,754
Maybe later. Thanks.

54
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:53,950
Let's talk about your song, Dave.

55
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,888
Well, as crazy as it sounds...

56
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,120
...the original inspiration came to me...
- The song sucks, Dave.

57
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:03,858
- What?
- Your song? It's awful. I hate it.

58
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:10,274
You know, I mean, who's gonna sing it?
Justin, Fergie? Not a chance.

59
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:12,602
I need something new.
I need something fresh.

60
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:15,075
- That is new.
- The next big thing.

61
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:18,738
Dave, we go way back, all right?

62
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,477
And we've both come a long way
since college. You? Not so much.

63
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:28,392
I wanted to like that song,
but you heard it. Not that good.

64
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:31,088
If I wasn't your friend,
I'd say:

65
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:34,959
"Dave, you go right back
out of this office...

66
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,931
...and you keep writing music.
You'll get there someday."

67
00:07:38,102 --> 00:07:40,434
But I am your friend,
so I'm going to tell you...

68
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:42,835
...that there is no sense
in writing songs...

69
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:48,206
...that no one is ever,
ever going to sing.

70
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,909
Ever?

71
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:05,025
Excuse me.

72
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:08,658
Can I get some of that water?

73
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,733
We ran out.

74
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:41,563
Hey!

75
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:50,440
- Out of the way.
- Alvin...

76
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,576
...slow down.
- Move your butt, Theodore.

77
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:55,234
You stepped on my tail.

78
00:08:58,516 --> 00:09:00,416
Last one to the door is roadkill.

79
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:02,018
I'm in.

80
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:03,619
What are these shiny things?

81
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:06,552
Theodore, we're leaving now.

82
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,456
Okay, this wasn't my best idea.
Look out!

83
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,066
Maniac!

84
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:21,198
Back to tree. Back to tree.

85
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:23,203
Back to the dog. Back to the dog!

86
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:25,808
- Basket! Three o'clock.
- Which way is 3 o'clock?

87
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,877
- This way.
- Guys, wait for me.

88
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:31,412
Wait up.
I still have baby fat, you know.

89
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:34,073
- Jump. You've gotta really want it.
- I want it.

90
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:36,413
- I want it.
- I can't hang like this all day.

91
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,614
Will you jump already?

92
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:42,383
Muffins.

93
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:09,846
Gross. Is this his house?

94
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:13,319
No. It's his garbage can.

95
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,998
This must be where he stores
his food for winter.

96
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:01,705
<i>As it came down to one...</i>

97
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:04,636
<i>Boa has the mouse trapped on a branch
with no way out.</i>

98
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:07,073
<i>As the boa moves in for the attack...</i>

99
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:10,338
<i>... the mouse
seems to be facing certain death.</i>

100
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:18,488
<i>The boa's sensitive tongue
tastes the victim's presence.</i>

101
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:21,056
<i>The mouse crashes
through the foliage.</i>

102
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:23,750
Come on, baby. Come to papa!

103
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:26,658
Hello, gorgeous.

104
00:11:28,432 --> 00:11:30,024
We've hit the mother lode.

105
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:33,261
<i>- Tropical rainforest
where food is bountiful.</i>

106
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:39,738
This is the greatest day of my life.

107
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,674
Eureka! I found the cheese balls.

108
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:46,112
Alvin, what are you doing?
Don't make a mess.

109
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:48,751
Cannonball.

110
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:53,219
Quick. Hide.

111
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:55,359
Hurry, you guys.

112
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,441
Did I put these here?

113
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:04,187
There you are. I got you.

114
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:17,060
He's been out for quite a while.

115
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:18,563
You guys, he's dead.

116
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:21,432
Don't panic. Wipe everything down.

117
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:24,369
I need three garbage bags, a shovel,
some disinfectant...

118
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,601
...some latex gloves and oregano, go!

119
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:29,006
Hang on, Sherlock. He's coming to.

120
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,876
I must be hearing things.

121
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,344
Oh, this is trippy.

122
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:39,716
Sir, are you all right?

123
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:44,021
Get back!

124
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:45,526
Squirrels can't talk.

125
00:14:45,696 --> 00:14:47,357
Hey.

126
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:49,195
Watch it, genius.

127
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:51,891
We are chipmunks. Chipmunks.

128
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:54,401
Chipmunks can't talk either.

129
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:56,267
Our lips are moving
and words are coming out.

130
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:58,365
This is not happening.

131
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:02,069
I am not talking to chipmunks.
I am not talking to chipmunks.

132
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:04,441
So how's that working for you, Dave?

133
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:06,710
How do you know my name?

134
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:09,978
I'll field that one.
We read your mail. By accident.

135
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,486
You really ought to pay
that utility bill, Dave.

136
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:15,557
- You ever heard of a credit rating?
- What's this thing?

137
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:18,593
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Stop doing... Turn that off.

138
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:20,389
Sorry.

139
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:22,657
He fell out of the tree at birth.

140
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:24,960
Can all animals talk?

141
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:28,502
Well, I believe fish
have this type of sign language.

142
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:31,835
Hey, Dave, do all humans have houses
that smell like sweat socks?

143
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:33,499
<i>Dave likes to wear</i>

144
00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:36,441
<i>Dirty underwear with little hairs</i>

145
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:38,411
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

146
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:41,648
Allow us to introduce ourselves.

147
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:44,151
Hello, I'm Simon, the smart one.

148
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:46,653
- He's Alvin.
- The awesomest one.

149
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:48,655
And I'm Theodore.

150
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:51,454
Oh, nice to meet you.
Now get out of my house.

151
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:54,154
But we talk.

152
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:57,463
Which makes me want you
out of my house that much more.

153
00:15:57,635 --> 00:16:00,968
It's creepy. Unnatural. Somewhat evil.

154
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:03,606
I kind of liked him better
when he was unconscious.

155
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:06,174
- Gotcha.
- Hey.

156
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:15,318
Don't do this, Dave.

157
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:18,148
We can gnaw right through this door.

158
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:26,422
Hi.

159
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:10,831
Oh, were we disturbing you?

160
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:13,709
What, you guys can sing too?

161
00:17:13,877 --> 00:17:17,074
That's not singing. This is singing.

162
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:46,234
This is amazing.

163
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:49,368
Here, everyone inside.

164
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:56,609
- There you go.
- Thank you.

165
00:17:59,323 --> 00:18:01,154
All right, here's the deal.

166
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:04,920
You guys sing my songs,
you get to sleep here.

167
00:18:08,098 --> 00:18:11,090
No. Wait. Is breakfast included?

168
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:14,161
I can live with that.

169
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:16,431
What about TV privileges?

170
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:18,764
Okay, but not after 7.

171
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:19,966
- Eight.
- Done.

172
00:18:20,244 --> 00:18:23,577
But don't tell your animal friends,
because I don't wanna come home...

173
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:25,840
...and find rabbits
and skunks on my couch.

174
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,484
Filthy creatures, Dave.
Never associate with them.

175
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:30,449
Yeah, you're our only friend.

176
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:33,647
No, no, no.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

177
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:37,282
Let's just start with me
being your songwriter.

178
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:41,425
Let me ask you.
Have you ever written a song before?

179
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:45,329
- Yup.
- And is that your music stuff outside?

180
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:47,094
Yup.

181
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:49,970
Oh, no!

182
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,300
Hurry back.

183
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:21,499
So, fellas, all we gotta do
is find the right song, rehearse...

184
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:26,670
- Hey, Dave.
- Simon.

185
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:28,903
My bad.

186
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:31,673
This is my sheet music.

187
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,308
Alvin.

188
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,848
This is not a Hula-Hoop.
It's a towel rack.

189
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:44,221
- Killjoy.
- Are you guys always like this?

190
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:46,021
We're kids, Dave.

191
00:19:46,196 --> 00:19:47,663
Well, where are your parents?

192
00:19:47,831 --> 00:19:50,994
When you're a chipmunk, your parents
take care of you for a week.

193
00:19:51,168 --> 00:19:52,692
Then they take off.

194
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,862
Our parents were hippies.
They left early to join a commune.

195
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,499
<i>- I am Robert the Robot.
- Help! Crazy robot. Help! It's after me!</i>

196
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:03,077
- It's after me.
- Hey. Hey. Be careful with that.

197
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:06,914
- Sorry.
- It's a collectible.

198
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:11,646
- I got it for Christmas last year.
- Christmas! We love Christmas.

199
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:15,054
Even though we've never
actually celebrated it.

200
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:17,090
But we want to.

201
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:19,855
Yeah, you can never go wrong
with Christmas.

202
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,430
Oh, maybe we can celebrate it
with you.

203
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,528
Yeah, maybe.

204
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:29,400
Look, I've had a long and weird day,
so off to bed.

205
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:31,165
Come on.

206
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:33,302
We start work tomorrow.

207
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:36,378
I want you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed by 8.

208
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:38,879
My tail isn't bushy till 9.

209
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,680
Not my problem. Now go to sleep.

210
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,751
I hope Christmas comes fast.

211
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:51,556
Me too.

212
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:35,105
<i>Want a plane that loops the loop?</i>

213
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,807
Loop.

214
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:39,665
Hoop.

215
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:42,106
Hula-Hoop.

216
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:44,102
Here's trouble. Fire in the hole!

217
00:22:44,308 --> 00:22:45,775
What are you guys doing?

218
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:47,876
Nothing. What are you doing?

219
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:50,673
Stand back, Dave. She's gonna blow!

220
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,009
I got it. I got it, guys. Come to papa.

221
00:22:57,187 --> 00:23:02,250
- Hey. Where did it go?
- Simon, this landed right in front of you.

222
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,121
You didn't see it?

223
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:06,526
How many fingers am I holding up?

224
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:10,224
Four. No, no, no.
Eight? Counting your thumb?

225
00:23:11,234 --> 00:23:13,259
- Wait, wait, wait...
- Hang on a second.

226
00:23:13,437 --> 00:23:14,904
Six. Final answer is six.

227
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:21,733
Try these.

228
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,875
How's that?

229
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:26,115
Someone trashed your house.

230
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,775
It was clean
when I went to bed last night.

231
00:23:28,952 --> 00:23:33,252
Well, we colored for a while,
but then we got hungry.

232
00:23:33,423 --> 00:23:34,822
Wanna see what we colored?

233
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:36,754
Actually, I wanna play you
something.

234
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:39,794
I wrote a song
for you guys to sing, so let's...

235
00:23:47,437 --> 00:23:50,270
We've put a few toaster waffles
aside for winter.

236
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,998
And we're not sharing.

237
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:57,638
Guys, we're gonna have food all winter,
so if you start storing it...

238
00:23:57,814 --> 00:24:00,783
...it's gonna get gross
and we're gonna have rodent...

239
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:08,381
Bad, you know,
non-talking rodents around here.

240
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:11,927
Let's go. Let's get to work.

241
00:24:21,004 --> 00:24:23,472
All right, you chipmunks.
Ready to sing your song?

242
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,200
- I'll say we are.
- Yeah. Let's sing it now.

243
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,207
- Ready, Simon?
- Okay.

244
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:30,676
- Ready, Theodore?
- Okay.

245
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:32,712
Alvin?

246
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:34,344
Alvin?

247
00:24:34,518 --> 00:24:36,179
This kicks a hamster wheel's butt.

248
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,181
Alvin!

249
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:41,148
Okay!

250
00:24:41,324 --> 00:24:45,658
<i>Christmas, Christmastime is near</i>

251
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:50,823
<i>Time for toys and time for cheer</i>

252
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:55,495
<i>We've been good, but we can't last</i>

253
00:24:55,672 --> 00:25:00,336
<i>Hurry, Christmas, hurry fast</i>

254
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:05,573
<i>Want a plane that loops the loop</i>

255
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:09,981
<i>Me, I want a Hula-Hoop</i>

256
00:25:10,153 --> 00:25:14,749
<i>We can't hardly stand the wait</i>

257
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:18,894
<i>Please, Christmas, don't be late</i>

258
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:24,658
What?

259
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:26,200
<i>Dave Seville's in the lobby.</i>

260
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:29,202
<i>He says he won't leave
without seeing you.</i>

261
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:33,573
That loser again?

262
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:43,786
- Dave.
- Ian.

263
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:47,049
- Okay.
- I've got something for you.

264
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:48,885
- It's your next big thing.
- Dave.

265
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:50,856
Don't say anything.

266
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,554
What the...?

267
00:25:57,434 --> 00:25:59,629
Dave, don't do this to yourself, man.

268
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:01,293
They sing.

269
00:26:06,376 --> 00:26:08,310
No. They don't.

270
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,072
They do. Just give me a second.

271
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:13,239
Come on, guys.

272
00:26:13,717 --> 00:26:17,915
<i>Want a plane that loops the loop</i>

273
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:22,718
<i>Me, I want a Hula-Hoop</i>

274
00:26:24,027 --> 00:26:25,085
You know, Dave...

275
00:26:25,262 --> 00:26:27,287
...some people might say
it's kind of weird...

276
00:26:27,464 --> 00:26:29,762
...that a grown man
would want a Hula-Hoop.

277
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:32,959
And others would say,
"You know what's weirder than that?

278
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:35,468
A grown man bringing
another grown man...

279
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:37,937
...a big box
with a bunch of chipmunks in it...

280
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:40,303
...who not only speak English
but can sing."

281
00:26:40,477 --> 00:26:42,911
They do sing.
We've been practicing all morning.

282
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,913
Oh, you've been practicing.
I never realized. Okay, well.

283
00:26:52,422 --> 00:26:56,586
Yeah. Okay, no.
Dave, I'm going to pretend...

284
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,354
...that I have a lunch to go to.

285
00:26:59,563 --> 00:27:01,827
I've got a lunch to go to.

286
00:27:01,998 --> 00:27:03,090
What was that?

287
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:05,996
Nothing. Nothing.
Just a little stage fright.

288
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:07,932
I thought my heart
was gonna explode.

289
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:09,662
We're not performing monkeys.

290
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,704
Why do we have to sing
for that guy?

291
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:12,967
Well, how's this?

292
00:27:13,143 --> 00:27:15,304
Pretend I need the money
and I hate my job...

293
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:18,140
...and you're staying at my place,
so you owe me.

294
00:27:18,315 --> 00:27:19,373
We're sorry, Dave.

295
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,608
Yeah, that helps.

296
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:25,453
Never mind. I'm late for work.

297
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:26,884
Can we go with you?

298
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,685
What, so you can mess that up too?

299
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:31,884
You're going home.

300
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:36,662
Can I stand in your lap and steer?

301
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:40,325
Oh, can we at least beep the horn?

302
00:27:40,503 --> 00:27:41,595
Never mind.

303
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:47,541
So sorry about the delay.
It should be a couple more minutes.

304
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:50,543
But we're building the suspense.

305
00:27:51,247 --> 00:27:54,808
- Here he is.
- Sorry I'm late.

306
00:28:01,157 --> 00:28:05,651
Boy, am I jazzed about our
Yum-able Energy Bars commercial.

307
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:08,821
That's Good-able Energy Bar
commercial.

308
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:11,026
Right, Good-able.

309
00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:13,533
Okay, here's the pitch.

310
00:28:13,703 --> 00:28:16,763
We open on a group of lethargic kids.

311
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,034
Close-up on a little girl's face.
She's sad.

312
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,236
Our customers don't like to think
of their kids as being sad.

313
00:28:23,413 --> 00:28:25,074
Could she be flying a kite?

314
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:26,647
I like kites.

315
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,281
Good.

316
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:31,117
Okay, great. She's flying a kite.

317
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:34,688
She's running with a kite.
She's running out of steam.

318
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:38,126
She's tired and lets go of the kite.

319
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:41,752
Oh, no. We see her face, it's sad.

320
00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:44,399
- But not too sad.
- Right.

321
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:48,697
So she pulls out
her Good-able Energy Bar...

322
00:28:53,276 --> 00:28:54,903
It's my mom. Sorry.

323
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:58,539
<i>- Hi, Mom.
- A little situation, Dave.</i>

324
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:00,740
Theodore vacuumed up Alvin.

325
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:03,317
- Alvin.
- Dave, help!

326
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:06,922
<i>- What?
- At least it wasn't the garbage disposal.</i>

327
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,250
Just stay calm.

328
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:10,954
And there goes Theodore.

329
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:13,220
Look, I can't do this right now, okay?

330
00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:16,229
I absolutely understand but...
Sorry, Dave?

331
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,764
Quick question.

332
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:22,100
How do you feel about an indoor pool?

333
00:29:22,272 --> 00:29:24,433
Look, if you flood my house,
you're dead.

334
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:25,972
Out on the street, capiche?

335
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:29,810
Mothers.

336
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:36,649
Why don't we come over here
and look at the sales projections?

337
00:29:37,754 --> 00:29:41,986
You know, when I first saw these
numbers, I thought there's just no way...

338
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:44,285
...but then I looked again.

339
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:51,963
The "size of Theodore's butt"?

340
00:29:52,135 --> 00:29:54,933
Why don't we come back to that?

341
00:29:55,105 --> 00:29:58,666
Anyway, 10 years ago, the market share
for healthy food snacks...

342
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:02,107
...was imperceptible
among 6- to 12-year-olds.

343
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:03,768
"How smart Simon thinks he is"?

344
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:07,643
Yeah, as opposed to
how smart he actually is.

345
00:30:07,817 --> 00:30:09,011
Who's Simon?

346
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:12,183
- I didn't...
- Just move it along.

347
00:30:19,362 --> 00:30:23,560
You know what?
I think I'll just clean out my office.

348
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:25,735
Sounds good.

349
00:30:25,902 --> 00:30:27,995
<i>SpongeBob. You're 15 minutes late.</i>

350
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:33,575
<i>Sorry, Mr. Krabs,
I was out all night looking for Gary.</i>

351
00:30:33,777 --> 00:30:35,677
<i>He got away. Well...</i>

352
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:38,313
Guys. What's this about?

353
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:41,177
Obviously, Theodore's butt.

354
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:42,841
We told you we colored.

355
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:47,012
On my presentation boards?
You got me fired.

356
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:49,484
We didn't know.

357
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,921
- We're sorry, Dave.
- Oh, you're sorry? That's fantastic.

358
00:30:54,097 --> 00:30:58,227
Sorry doesn't get my job back, now,
does it, Theodore?

359
00:30:58,835 --> 00:31:01,201
Why are my clothes all over the place?

360
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:03,896
We used them to mop up the water.
Good idea, right?

361
00:31:04,874 --> 00:31:06,671
Oh, my God. Theodore, did you just...?

362
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:09,838
It's a raisin, Dave.

363
00:31:10,446 --> 00:31:11,538
Prove it.

364
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:17,410
Okay, you got me.

365
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:19,748
I wanna talk to all you guys.
Where's Alvin?

366
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:23,519
- Alvin?
- You owe me bigtime.

367
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:25,558
Alvin.

368
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:27,621
Come on. Come on.

369
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:39,201
There's this new thing.
It's called knocking.

370
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:42,208
- Get out.
- I'm waiting for the rinse cycle.

371
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:44,778
- Out.
- I'm taking a shower here.

372
00:31:44,948 --> 00:31:47,542
You know,
if I made a list of my worst days ever...

373
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:49,947
...today would be at the top
of the list.

374
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,144
And it's still early.

375
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:53,379
Clam it, sudsy.

376
00:31:56,492 --> 00:31:59,723
Okay. Guys, let me just put it
to you like this, okay?

377
00:31:59,896 --> 00:32:05,493
I have no job, no career, my house
is always a mess. Thank you very much.

378
00:32:05,902 --> 00:32:10,669
<i>Hi, Dave. It's Claire Wilson calling.
And why did I just say my last name?</i>

379
00:32:10,874 --> 00:32:16,335
<i>That was weird. I guess I'm just a little
nervous about coming over for dinner.</i>

380
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:18,673
<i>- Dinner.
- So, yeah. I'm gonna hang up now.</i>

381
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:22,443
<i>I'll be there at 7. Okay. Bye.</i>

382
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:24,018
That's half an hour.

383
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,182
Who's Claire?

384
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:30,825
Claire is Dave's mate.

385
00:32:30,994 --> 00:32:32,985
She is not my mate.

386
00:32:33,162 --> 00:32:34,891
She's my ex-mate.

387
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:39,291
Okay. This is great.

388
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:41,300
Dave. Dave, relax.

389
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:44,167
You just go get the food.
We'll take care of the rest.

390
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,205
Why am I having a hard time
believing you?

391
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:49,276
That hurts, Dave. That really hurts.

392
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:52,278
- Yeah. We're all in this together, Dave.
- Like a family.

393
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:54,811
No. Not like a family.

394
00:32:54,984 --> 00:32:57,043
Tick-tock, Dave. Better bust a move.

395
00:32:57,453 --> 00:32:58,920
Right.

396
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:20,708
We also do offices
and recreational vehicles.

397
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:23,411
What's that smell?

398
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:26,446
It's your cologne.

399
00:33:27,016 --> 00:33:29,678
What did you do?
Dump the entire bottle on the rug?

400
00:33:29,852 --> 00:33:32,514
We call it scenting the area.

401
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:34,850
I gotta admit I'm surprised.

402
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:36,082
The place looks great.

403
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:39,490
Well, Dave, we chipmunks
are notoriously tidy.

404
00:33:39,662 --> 00:33:41,061
Yeah, I see that.

405
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:44,156
- Those bread sticks smell great.
- Yeah.

406
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:46,501
So when's dinner?

407
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:49,900
Guys, I don't know
how to tell you this...

408
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:52,041
...but it's just gonna be Claire and me.

409
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:53,368
Hold the phone, Dave.

410
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:54,567
- We can't have...
- No.

411
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:55,768
- Even if we...
- No.

412
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:58,539
- We thought it...
- And no. Look, in the other room.

413
00:33:58,715 --> 00:34:00,683
Jeez.

414
00:34:00,883 --> 00:34:03,351
What a buzzkill, man.

415
00:34:05,288 --> 00:34:08,883
- I never knew you could cook this well.
- It's all about slow roasting.

416
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:14,093
It takes longer.
But when it comes to flavor, why rush?

417
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:15,696
Well, I'm impressed.

418
00:34:19,002 --> 00:34:22,062
- I've been seeing your photos.
- Yeah, it's going really great.

419
00:34:22,238 --> 00:34:24,297
How about you, how's your job?

420
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:29,269
Great. Loving it.

421
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:34,982
How do you think it's going?

422
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:37,483
Terrible. They're not even sniffing
each other.

423
00:34:37,653 --> 00:34:39,143
Alvin. Dave said that...

424
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:42,917
Dave needs a little help
from the love doctor.

425
00:34:43,092 --> 00:34:44,320
And his assistant.

426
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:46,256
Get back here.

427
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:48,428
You know, this is nice.

428
00:34:48,598 --> 00:34:51,795
Just two friends having dinner.
Hanging out.

429
00:34:51,968 --> 00:34:54,937
No pressure. Nothing weird.

430
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:06,506
My stereo does that all the time.
It's like it has a mind of its own.

431
00:35:06,682 --> 00:35:08,047
You were saying?

432
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:12,581
Oh, nothing. I was just a little nervous
about coming over here.

433
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:15,588
I wasn't sure if you thought
this was a date or something.

434
00:35:15,992 --> 00:35:18,153
A date? No.

435
00:35:25,768 --> 00:35:28,168
The wiring in my unit is shot.

436
00:35:29,138 --> 00:35:31,333
You should get an electrician
to fix that.

437
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:34,670
I don't need anyone
to fix anything for me.

438
00:35:38,815 --> 00:35:40,942
Okay.

439
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:48,887
Could you excuse me for a moment?
I'm gonna go check the fuse box.

440
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:58,625
Hey.

441
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:01,996
Look, I know what you guys
are up to. Alvin.

442
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:04,298
- Breath check.
- Where's Al...?

443
00:36:06,909 --> 00:36:08,501
Dave, are you okay?

444
00:36:08,678 --> 00:36:10,009
Everything's fine.

445
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,477
Why did you do that?

446
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:16,243
I was just trying to help, Dave.
You have garlic breath.

447
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:19,715
Well, stop helping.
You're ruining everything.

448
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:24,887
I think I got something in my eye.

449
00:36:25,061 --> 00:36:27,393
Here. Let me see.

450
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:33,900
Yeah. It looks really irritated.
It's so red. What happened?

451
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,901
What was that?

452
00:36:36,072 --> 00:36:37,369
Oh, I thought I saw a rat.

453
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,837
- A rat?
- Probably nothing.

454
00:36:39,008 --> 00:36:41,033
Here, let's finish eating, huh?

455
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:45,009
Tomorrow, I'm gonna call
the exterminator.

456
00:36:48,784 --> 00:36:50,718
- What?
- Claire.

457
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:52,286
Dave? Dave?

458
00:36:52,455 --> 00:36:55,515
- Tell her she completes you.
- What are you doing?

459
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:57,556
- You got it, Dave.
- Dave.

460
00:36:57,727 --> 00:36:58,751
Dave, let go.

461
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,955
I'm sorry, Claire. It's just...

462
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:07,195
I lost my job, Claire.

463
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,894
And I guess I just needed a hug.

464
00:37:09,071 --> 00:37:12,234
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Tell me what happened.

465
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:15,605
Well, this is gonna sound
really strange.

466
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:18,709
No games. No fooling around.

467
00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:22,416
- The truth?
- Please, I'm begging you.

468
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:29,824
My life is being sabotaged
by talking chipmunks.

469
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:39,065
- You know what?
- I'm not crazy, I swear.

470
00:37:39,235 --> 00:37:40,964
You haven't changed at all.

471
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:48,836
Wait. Claire. Don't go. I can explain.

472
00:37:52,348 --> 00:37:54,316
Chipmunks.

473
00:37:57,453 --> 00:37:59,148
You should've kissed her, Dave.

474
00:37:59,322 --> 00:38:00,414
She wanted you.

475
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,114
Alvin, you're not helping.

476
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:03,451
Don't give up, Dave.

477
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:05,093
Go away. Leave me alone.

478
00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:07,456
Dave, would you like a cookie?

479
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,121
I said, leave me alone.

480
00:38:14,103 --> 00:38:17,539
Is it me, or was he a little mad?

481
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,503
I wonder, is Dave mad? Yes.

482
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:21,336
He really did have garlic breath.

483
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,034
Yeah, well-played, guys.

484
00:38:23,246 --> 00:38:25,009
Idea.

485
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:26,375
Who has cab fare?

486
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:29,780
Cab fare?
We don't even have pockets.

487
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:58,412
<i>Dear fellas, I'm sorry,
but this isn't really working out.</i>

488
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:02,807
<i>I don't know what made me think
I could handle you guys...</i>

489
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:05,351
<i>... when I can barely manage
my own life.</i>

490
00:39:05,521 --> 00:39:08,922
<i>You should go back to your real home
in the forest.</i>

491
00:39:09,091 --> 00:39:11,218
<i>That's what's best for all of us.</i>

492
00:39:11,661 --> 00:39:14,687
<i>I'm sorry it has to be this way, but...</i>

493
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,346
Guys?

494
00:39:37,253 --> 00:39:39,847
Simon, Theodore?

495
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:44,852
Guys?

496
00:39:47,463 --> 00:39:49,328
Alvin?

497
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:54,430
Alvin!

498
00:39:58,074 --> 00:39:59,905
Simon?

499
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:04,541
Theodore?

500
00:40:05,414 --> 00:40:07,143
Alvin?

501
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:09,843
Alvin.

502
00:40:30,404 --> 00:40:31,962
Hello?

503
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:34,636
Hello?

504
00:40:35,509 --> 00:40:37,136
Kids.

505
00:40:41,782 --> 00:40:46,515
<i>Christmas, Christmastime is near</i>

506
00:40:46,687 --> 00:40:51,351
<i>Time for toys and time for cheer</i>

507
00:40:51,525 --> 00:40:56,019
<i>We can't hardly stand the wait</i>

508
00:40:56,197 --> 00:40:59,496
<i>Please, Christmas, don't be late</i>

509
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:03,702
Welcome to Jett Records.

510
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:20,783
Okay. New rule.
No going out after 9.

511
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:23,287
And not at all unless
I know where you're going.

512
00:41:23,457 --> 00:41:25,152
Were you worried about us, Dave?

513
00:41:25,326 --> 00:41:27,157
No. I just need to know, that's all.

514
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:30,661
Wait. If you're not worried,
then why do you need to know?

515
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:33,231
I need to know, okay?

516
00:41:42,443 --> 00:41:44,138
Alvin.

517
00:41:48,749 --> 00:41:52,583
Oh, sorry about that. Yeah.

518
00:41:52,753 --> 00:41:54,414
- Sorry.
- Kids, huh?

519
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:56,818
They keep you on your toes.
Do you have any?

520
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,253
Three boys.

521
00:41:58,459 --> 00:42:00,427
Well, some days
are better than others.

522
00:42:00,594 --> 00:42:03,188
And some days
you just wanna close them in a box...

523
00:42:03,364 --> 00:42:06,094
...leave the box in the park
and run away, you know?

524
00:42:15,876 --> 00:42:17,468
Quick, hide.

525
00:42:19,747 --> 00:42:21,442
Guys, what's all this?

526
00:42:21,615 --> 00:42:23,515
Toaster waffles.

527
00:42:23,684 --> 00:42:26,244
You know, I can't afford
all these toaster waffles.

528
00:42:27,221 --> 00:42:29,280
- What?
- Well, in case you didn't notice...

529
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,923
...I don't have a job anymo...

530
00:42:40,034 --> 00:42:41,433
My song?

531
00:42:43,104 --> 00:42:44,799
- All right.
- Yeah.

532
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:52,938
- Hello?
- Hey, Dave.

533
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:56,606
Hey, how's my favorite songwriter?

534
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:58,942
<i>- Ian?
- Tell me you've heard the song.</i>

535
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,247
Yeah. I'm listening to it right now.

536
00:43:01,422 --> 00:43:02,787
How did you...? When did...?

537
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:06,984
Speed of business, baby.
That's how we do it. That's how I roll.

538
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:10,153
Got a friend in satellite radio,
put it in immediate rotation.

539
00:43:10,331 --> 00:43:14,665
And that video of your little guys,
10 million hits already on YouTube.

540
00:43:17,772 --> 00:43:19,330
It's crazy. I gotta go.

541
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,839
Hey, put some clothes on those guys.
It's kind of embarrassing.

542
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:30,680
We owed you, Dave.

543
00:43:31,452 --> 00:43:35,479
So we're good
with the toaster waffles, right? Dave?

544
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,323
Soup's on.

545
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:32,703
Alvin.

546
00:44:44,158 --> 00:44:45,853
So, what do you think?

547
00:44:46,026 --> 00:44:47,323
Cool.

548
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:19,516
All right.

549
00:45:26,033 --> 00:45:29,025
Toothbrush, huh? Okay.

550
00:45:33,741 --> 00:45:34,799
No.

551
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:52,084
Dave...

552
00:45:52,726 --> 00:45:54,591
...are you awake?

553
00:45:54,762 --> 00:45:55,820
I am now.

554
00:45:55,996 --> 00:45:57,327
I had a nightmare.

555
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:00,394
Can I sleep with you?

556
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,437
You won't even know I'm here.

557
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:07,639
Okay. Sure.
But stay on that side of the bed.

558
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:10,299
Oh, okay.

559
00:46:24,725 --> 00:46:28,217
Theodore, that's not your side
of the bed.

560
00:46:48,983 --> 00:46:53,044
- Theodore, wake up. It's Christmas.
- Come on, man. It's Christmas.

561
00:46:53,253 --> 00:46:54,447
Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

562
00:46:54,622 --> 00:46:56,681
<i>On the first day of Christmas
Dave woke up</i>

563
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,984
Come on, man, it's Christmas.
Hallelujah.

564
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:00,490
Wake up, lazy bones.

565
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:03,129
Oh, yeah. Christmas.

566
00:47:03,297 --> 00:47:05,629
- Up and at them.
- You can sleep when you're dead.

567
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:07,027
- I'm coming
- Come on, Dave.

568
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:08,225
Hurry up, Dad.

569
00:47:08,402 --> 00:47:12,133
- Dad?
- Dave. I said Dave.

570
00:47:12,306 --> 00:47:14,797
This is shaping up to be
my favorite Christmas ever.

571
00:47:14,975 --> 00:47:17,205
- You want to open mine first.
- Open mine first.

572
00:47:17,378 --> 00:47:19,972
- No, Dave, mine is better.
- You guys got me presents?

573
00:47:20,147 --> 00:47:21,978
Of course.

574
00:47:24,652 --> 00:47:27,018
All right. Simon?

575
00:47:30,991 --> 00:47:33,357
Wow, it's a...

576
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:35,017
It's a paper-clip compass.

577
00:47:35,596 --> 00:47:38,497
A paper-clip compass.
Now I'll never get lost.

578
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:39,928
Me next.

579
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,658
Alvin.

580
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:49,042
- My wallet.
- Do you like it?

581
00:47:49,209 --> 00:47:52,007
Really? I wanted to get you something
you'd use every day.

582
00:47:52,546 --> 00:47:55,242
And I have been using this
for almost 10 years now.

583
00:47:55,816 --> 00:47:57,681
Very thoughtful, Alvin. Thank you.

584
00:47:57,851 --> 00:48:00,718
Yeah, the look on your face
says it all, Dave.

585
00:48:01,889 --> 00:48:05,188
Oh, nicely done, Theodore.
"To Dav."

586
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,361
Let's see, it says, "Merry Christmas.
Love, Theodore."

587
00:48:11,532 --> 00:48:15,127
And it's got a nice picture
of some pineapples?

588
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:17,826
Those aren't pineapples.
That's our family.

589
00:48:20,474 --> 00:48:25,207
Look, fellas. Let's make sure
we understand each other here.

590
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:27,046
I'm not your...

591
00:48:28,716 --> 00:48:31,810
You know,
your dad or anything, right?

592
00:48:31,985 --> 00:48:33,850
But you're like a dad.

593
00:48:37,157 --> 00:48:39,455
Well, not really.

594
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:42,220
I mean, we're friends for sure.

595
00:48:42,396 --> 00:48:45,490
And I write your music, you know,
manage your career.

596
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:47,998
- Make us sweaters.
- Feed us.

597
00:48:48,168 --> 00:48:51,069
Let us sleep in your bed
when we have nightmares.

598
00:48:51,505 --> 00:48:53,405
That's what friends do.

599
00:48:56,143 --> 00:48:58,168
So who wants to open their presents?

600
00:48:58,378 --> 00:49:00,573
- Is that a trick question? We do.
- Yeah.

601
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:02,579
- Presents.
- Oh, boy.

602
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,149
Presents. Presents. Presents.

603
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:06,309
I can't wait to open mine first.

604
00:49:06,487 --> 00:49:07,784
Envelopes.

605
00:49:11,391 --> 00:49:12,824
They're savings bonds.

606
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:14,324
Cool.

607
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:18,363
You know, in seven years, you're
gonna get to buy something really nice.

608
00:49:18,532 --> 00:49:22,400
Do you maybe have any
that you bought seven years ago?

609
00:49:23,504 --> 00:49:26,667
- Alvin, manners.
- Thank you, Dave.

610
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,331
Yeah. Thanks, Dave.

611
00:49:32,446 --> 00:49:35,847
- Ian?
- Who wants presents?

612
00:49:36,617 --> 00:49:37,982
- All right.
- Cool.

613
00:49:38,152 --> 00:49:40,313
Hey, there's plenty more
where this came from.

614
00:49:40,487 --> 00:49:41,954
Bring them on in, fellas.

615
00:49:42,122 --> 00:49:44,056
- Oh, yeah.
- Jackpot.

616
00:49:44,224 --> 00:49:46,055
What are you doing?

617
00:49:46,226 --> 00:49:49,354
- Taking care of my boys.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

618
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,498
Weird. What happened
to your presents?

619
00:49:51,665 --> 00:49:54,361
- Which one is mine?
- That big one is for me, I think.

620
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:55,661
What did you get them?

621
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:57,801
Savings bonds.

622
00:49:57,971 --> 00:50:00,064
Great. Just what every kid dreams of.

623
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,401
You're in luck.
Your uncle Ian came through.

624
00:50:02,576 --> 00:50:05,443
- Cool.
- Uncle Ian?

625
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,404
Is... Is this for me?

626
00:50:08,582 --> 00:50:10,072
No, it's for Simon.

627
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,684
- Theodore.
- Oh, boy.

628
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,987
- And Alvin.
- Thank you, Santa.

629
00:50:18,158 --> 00:50:20,649
This is for you.
You like the Oak Ridge Boys, right?

630
00:50:20,828 --> 00:50:22,352
Yeah, you're welcome.

631
00:50:22,529 --> 00:50:23,860
And guess what, guys.

632
00:50:24,031 --> 00:50:27,558
Uncle Ian is gonna have
a big launch party for the new CD.

633
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:31,761
That's right. Press, paparazzi.
Hollywood hotshots.

634
00:50:31,972 --> 00:50:33,269
The whole nine yards.

635
00:50:33,473 --> 00:50:34,599
- Awesome.
- Sweet.

636
00:50:34,775 --> 00:50:38,438
Yeah. Dave, you've got one week
to write me a new hit single.

637
00:50:38,612 --> 00:50:40,409
All right? Something funky and fresh.

638
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:42,845
- Peace. We out.
- Bye, Uncle Ian.

639
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:46,008
- Merry Christmas.
- Now it really is Christmas.

640
00:50:46,186 --> 00:50:48,620
Mayday, mayday.

641
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:52,218
This way, this way, this way.

642
00:50:52,392 --> 00:50:56,954
All right. All right. Settle in, settle in.
Thank you for coming.

643
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:59,894
It is a very special night tonight.

644
00:51:00,067 --> 00:51:05,972
Here at Jett Records, we pride ourselves
on bringing you tomorrow's music today.

645
00:51:06,139 --> 00:51:09,074
Oh, and guess what. I did it again.

646
00:51:09,243 --> 00:51:12,906
Ladies and gentlemen,
here to sing their new hit single...

647
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:19,883
...give it up
for Alvin, Simon and Theodore.

648
00:51:20,053 --> 00:51:22,715
<i>Yeah, in the place to be</i>

649
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:27,293
<i>Chipmunks on the M-l-C
"Witch Doctor"</i>

650
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:29,053
<i>Everybody, can they do it?</i>

651
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:30,662
<i>Can they do it?</i>

652
00:51:30,831 --> 00:51:32,890
<i>Come on, people, let's get to it</i>

653
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:34,124
<i>Let's get to it</i>

654
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:37,998
<i>Come on, shake, come on, roll
Everybody hit the floor</i>

655
00:51:38,171 --> 00:51:42,631
<i>Come on, shake, come on, roll
With the Chipmunks, here we go</i>

656
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:46,301
<i>I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you</i>

657
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,813
<i>I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me too</i>

658
00:51:49,983 --> 00:51:53,077
<i>And then the witch doctor
He told me what to do</i>

659
00:51:53,253 --> 00:51:55,744
<i>He said:
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah</i>

660
00:51:55,923 --> 00:51:57,823
<i>To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang</i>

661
00:51:57,991 --> 00:52:01,449
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang</i>

662
00:52:01,628 --> 00:52:03,186
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah</i>

663
00:52:03,363 --> 00:52:05,456
<i>To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang</i>

664
00:52:05,632 --> 00:52:09,432
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang</i>

665
00:52:09,603 --> 00:52:10,934
<i>Yo, DJ, pump this party!</i>

666
00:52:11,104 --> 00:52:13,038
<i>Everybody, can they do it?</i>

667
00:52:13,206 --> 00:52:14,833
<i>- Can they do it?
- Go! Go! Go!</i>

668
00:52:15,008 --> 00:52:16,669
<i>Come on, people, let's get to it</i>

669
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,333
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

670
00:52:18,512 --> 00:52:22,209
<i>Come on, shake, come on, roll
Everybody hit the floor</i>

671
00:52:22,382 --> 00:52:25,783
<i>Come on, shake, come on, roll
With the Chipmunks, here we go</i>

672
00:52:25,953 --> 00:52:28,478
<i>Alvin! Simon! Theodore!</i>

673
00:52:28,655 --> 00:52:32,284
<i>I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me true</i>

674
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:35,986
<i>I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me nice</i>

675
00:52:36,163 --> 00:52:38,825
<i>And then the witch doctor
He gave me this advice</i>

676
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:40,796
<i>He said to me:</i>

677
00:52:45,205 --> 00:52:47,298
<i>To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang</i>

678
00:52:47,474 --> 00:52:51,342
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang</i>

679
00:52:51,511 --> 00:52:54,537
<i>You've been keeping love from me</i>

680
00:52:54,715 --> 00:52:58,651
<i>- And that's not very smart
- Not very smart</i>

681
00:52:58,819 --> 00:53:04,485
<i>I went out and found myself someone
Who'd tell me how to win your heart</i>

682
00:53:08,695 --> 00:53:12,324
<i>My friend the witch doctor
He told me what to say</i>

683
00:53:12,499 --> 00:53:16,094
<i>My friend the witch doctor
He told me what to do</i>

684
00:53:16,269 --> 00:53:20,330
<i>I know that you'll be mine
When I say this to you</i>

685
00:53:22,442 --> 00:53:25,104
<i>- Oh, baby, baby!
- Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah</i>

686
00:53:25,278 --> 00:53:27,371
<i>To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang</i>

687
00:53:27,547 --> 00:53:31,039
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang</i>

688
00:53:31,218 --> 00:53:32,913
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah</i>

689
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:34,917
<i>To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang</i>

690
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:38,717
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang</i>

691
00:53:44,731 --> 00:53:46,528
Yeah.

692
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:52,234
All right, party people.
You know how we do it.

693
00:53:52,406 --> 00:53:55,569
Get on that dance floor,
let me see what you got.

694
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:06,548
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

695
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,915
- You mind if I grab a few pics?
- Claire.

696
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:12,187
- Not at all. Fire away.
- Great.

697
00:54:12,759 --> 00:54:16,251
I've got a new assignment.
I'm covering your rise to fame.

698
00:54:18,432 --> 00:54:21,401
- Oh, this is Alvin, Simon and Theodore.
- Hi.

699
00:54:21,568 --> 00:54:22,933
- Hello.
- Hi, Claire.

700
00:54:23,103 --> 00:54:24,593
You're hot.

701
00:54:25,505 --> 00:54:27,564
Forgot you guys haven't officially met.

702
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:34,074
So, Dave...

703
00:54:34,247 --> 00:54:37,114
...l'm sorry about that night.
I really thought that you...

704
00:54:37,284 --> 00:54:38,444
That I was insane?

705
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:40,811
I totally understand it.

706
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:44,184
Talking chipmunks.
It's a lot to take in over dinner.

707
00:54:44,357 --> 00:54:49,317
But look at you now. You've got
the career, promising future, kids.

708
00:54:49,496 --> 00:54:50,588
You're like a family.

709
00:54:50,764 --> 00:54:53,858
Don't say "family" in front of Dave.
It gives him gas.

710
00:54:54,034 --> 00:54:57,970
- Like, clear-the-room gas.
- Does not.

711
00:54:58,138 --> 00:54:59,799
He doesn't want a family.

712
00:54:59,973 --> 00:55:02,874
Why don't you guys go and play
or raid the dessert table?

713
00:55:03,043 --> 00:55:04,874
Don't take it personally, you guys.

714
00:55:05,045 --> 00:55:07,775
Some people don't know a good thing
when they've got it.

715
00:55:07,948 --> 00:55:09,677
Right, Dave?

716
00:55:11,151 --> 00:55:12,846
Claire.

717
00:55:13,253 --> 00:55:17,519
No offense, big guy,
but you are not good at this.

718
00:55:24,965 --> 00:55:26,489
Hey, what do you think of this?

719
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,331
- What is it?
- It's Alvin.

720
00:55:29,503 --> 00:55:31,300
That looks nothing like Alvin.

721
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:34,998
Well, yeah. It's a prototype.
We'll sell a million of these things.

722
00:55:35,175 --> 00:55:38,008
It's voice-activated.
Here, say something to it.

723
00:55:38,879 --> 00:55:43,714
Hello, ugly little Alvin doll
that looks nothing like Alvin.

724
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:48,988
- See? You love it. It's Spanish.
- You know what? That's just weird.

725
00:55:49,156 --> 00:55:50,555
Come on, Dave, Dave, Dave.

726
00:55:50,724 --> 00:55:52,988
We've got to expand
the Munks' fan base.

727
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,594
I mean, forget about the music.

728
00:55:55,795 --> 00:55:59,526
The music is but a means
to the big money, okay?

729
00:55:59,699 --> 00:56:03,328
I'm talking about our own
fur clothing line, cologne.

730
00:56:03,503 --> 00:56:06,495
Chipmunk Heat, something like that.
Chipmunk wine coolers.

731
00:56:06,673 --> 00:56:08,106
- I mean...
- They're just kids.

732
00:56:08,308 --> 00:56:09,536
No, they're rats.

733
00:56:09,709 --> 00:56:13,008
And they could make us both
so much money...

734
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:17,913
...if you just let me work with them.
- I can't hear you, the music's too loud.

735
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:23,420
Don't go against me on this, Dave.
I never lose.

736
00:56:31,765 --> 00:56:34,563
Has anyone tried
the chocolate meatballs?

737
00:56:34,734 --> 00:56:37,794
I'll probably go into insulin shock.
But it's worth it.

738
00:56:37,971 --> 00:56:41,634
Oh, a sweet, sweet,
sweet molasses meat.

739
00:56:41,841 --> 00:56:45,902
Hey, Alvster. Love the song, bro.

740
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,707
- Up top.
- What's up, player?

741
00:56:49,282 --> 00:56:52,877
So I see you're enjoying my little spread
that I've put out for you guys.

742
00:56:53,053 --> 00:56:56,216
What am I talking about?
You probably eat like this all the time.

743
00:56:56,389 --> 00:56:58,880
Well, Dave says
he doesn't wanna spoil us.

744
00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:02,620
Dude, you're a rock star.
You're supposed to be spoiled.

745
00:57:02,796 --> 00:57:06,163
I mean, you should be riding
in limousines and private planes.

746
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:09,995
And you should be going to parties
like this every night.

747
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:12,297
Really?
Because Dave says we need our sleep.

748
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:18,069
Look, Alvin, this is hard to say
but, I mean, I gotta be upfront about it.

749
00:57:18,245 --> 00:57:23,114
Dave's holding you back, you know.
I could be making you 20 large a day.

750
00:57:23,283 --> 00:57:25,911
- Is that a lot?
- Yes.

751
00:57:26,086 --> 00:57:28,782
Another thing... I'm not gonna tell you.
I will tell you.

752
00:57:28,955 --> 00:57:32,982
Look, behind your back,
Dave calls you...

753
00:57:34,294 --> 00:57:35,420
..."the rats."

754
00:57:38,031 --> 00:57:40,829
- Rats?
- Yeah. Whatever, right? I know.

755
00:57:41,001 --> 00:57:44,869
Well, don't let it bother you.
I mean, me? I consider you boys family.

756
00:57:45,038 --> 00:57:47,666
And if there's anything you need,
anything at all...

757
00:57:47,841 --> 00:57:50,867
...give your uncle Ian a call, all right?

758
00:57:51,044 --> 00:57:54,411
- Oh, right.
- Ciao.

759
00:57:58,618 --> 00:58:02,110
Come on, pal.
You drive like my grandmother.

760
00:58:02,289 --> 00:58:03,847
Get a wheelchair. Move over!

761
00:58:04,724 --> 00:58:09,821
Hey, guys, look at me.
Up, up and away.

762
00:58:12,165 --> 00:58:14,133
Alvin.

763
00:58:14,668 --> 00:58:17,728
Can't help you, Simon.
I'm about to take the lead here.

764
00:58:17,937 --> 00:58:20,030
Hey, guys,
I have an idea for a new song.

765
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:22,735
Hey, Dave.

766
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:26,036
What's going on in here?
I thought I told you guys to clean up.

767
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:27,873
We are.

768
00:58:32,052 --> 00:58:35,749
- Who's that?
- Uncle Ian hired us a housekeeper.

769
00:58:35,955 --> 00:58:38,048
She's also a masseuse.

770
00:58:42,062 --> 00:58:44,053
Come on, move over, road hog.

771
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,063
Drive it or park it, pal.
Get in the slow lane.

772
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:49,428
- Where did you get that game?
- Uncle Ian.

773
00:58:49,602 --> 00:58:52,537
Move it or lose it!
Get some training wheels, buddy.

774
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:54,836
Okay, you know what?

775
00:58:55,008 --> 00:58:56,771
That's enough.

776
00:58:57,243 --> 00:58:59,837
What are you doing?
I was about to beat my high score.

777
00:59:00,013 --> 00:59:02,379
Too bad. Where's Theodore?

778
00:59:06,052 --> 00:59:07,679
Spit it out.

779
00:59:07,854 --> 00:59:10,220
- Spit it out.
- No.

780
00:59:12,092 --> 00:59:13,184
Jett Records.

781
00:59:13,727 --> 00:59:17,754
Okay. That's it. Meeting. Now.
Everyone on the couch.

782
00:59:18,398 --> 00:59:20,525
Could you give us a minute?

783
00:59:24,003 --> 00:59:27,530
Guys, look, it's hard, I know.

784
00:59:27,707 --> 00:59:32,110
Three months ago, you were hanging out
in a tree somewhere and now you're...

785
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:35,247
Major rock stars.

786
00:59:35,415 --> 00:59:38,316
Okay. Whatever.
My point is just because you're...

787
00:59:38,518 --> 00:59:40,145
Major rock stars.

788
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:45,989
Doesn't mean you can have or do
whatever you want.

789
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:48,719
Well, Uncle Ian says
we should always be happy.

790
00:59:48,895 --> 00:59:50,453
Okay, you know what?

791
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,962
He's not your uncle.

792
00:59:53,166 --> 00:59:58,900
He also, David, said
that we should be making $20 a day.

793
00:59:59,072 --> 01:00:01,302
Guess what.
You're making way more than that.

794
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:04,170
And because I care,
I'm putting it all away for you.

795
01:00:04,344 --> 01:00:06,403
Just like storing nuts for the winter.

796
01:00:06,579 --> 01:00:08,410
Oh, winter's for losers.

797
01:00:08,581 --> 01:00:12,073
Yeah. Shouldn't we have a say
in how to build our investment portfolio?

798
01:00:12,552 --> 01:00:16,249
Where is all this coming from?
You guys are just kids.

799
01:00:16,423 --> 01:00:20,018
- Kids, Dave, or rats?
- What?

800
01:00:20,193 --> 01:00:22,991
Well, Uncle Ian says
we're like his family.

801
01:00:23,163 --> 01:00:25,996
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you love Uncle Ian so much...

802
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:28,327
...and don't think I'm watching out
for you...

803
01:00:28,501 --> 01:00:30,662
...why don't you go live
with Uncle Ian?

804
01:00:41,881 --> 01:00:43,439
Dave?

805
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:45,783
Are you still mad at us?

806
01:00:46,986 --> 01:00:48,681
Dave?

807
01:00:58,031 --> 01:01:01,228
"Dear fellas, I'm sorry, but...

808
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:05,459
You should go back
to your real home in the forest."

809
01:01:05,638 --> 01:01:08,471
I guess he really does want us to go.

810
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,185
I told you, Dave.

811
01:01:22,355 --> 01:01:24,346
I never lose.

812
01:01:50,884 --> 01:01:55,287
Boys, welcome to your new home.

813
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:05,187
- Oh, yeah. Daddy's home.
- Yeah.

814
01:02:05,365 --> 01:02:07,629
Can we play with all this stuff?

815
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,200
Sure, why not? It's your house.

816
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:12,736
So, what are the rules around here?

817
01:02:13,473 --> 01:02:16,806
Oh, I do have one rule...

818
01:02:16,976 --> 01:02:20,104
...that there are no rules!
- Cool.

819
01:02:31,424 --> 01:02:33,551
Four degrees elevation.

820
01:02:33,726 --> 01:02:36,058
Six degrees azimuth.

821
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:39,221
Fire!

822
01:02:50,777 --> 01:02:53,678
Prepare to face the fury
of my vengeance.

823
01:02:53,846 --> 01:02:55,973
Don't make me laugh.

824
01:02:56,149 --> 01:02:58,640
Pray for a quick demise,
young chipmunk.

825
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:01,116
Uppercut. Left. Fake-out, fake-out.

826
01:03:09,862 --> 01:03:13,525
Your kung fu is no match
for my rockets.

827
01:03:15,134 --> 01:03:16,726
Sneak attack.

828
01:03:19,439 --> 01:03:21,168
Okay, Simon. That's enough.

829
01:03:21,641 --> 01:03:23,768
I'm finished now. Simon.

830
01:03:23,943 --> 01:03:25,968
- Hey, give me that.
- Let go, Alvin.

831
01:03:26,145 --> 01:03:27,237
Oh, come on.

832
01:03:30,283 --> 01:03:32,274
- You had a turn.
- Who says you get a turn?

833
01:03:32,452 --> 01:03:33,680
Give me that.

834
01:03:36,823 --> 01:03:38,620
Simon!

835
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:41,055
- You got to try.
- Get your mangy paws off of it.

836
01:03:44,063 --> 01:03:45,621
- Scram.
- I want it.

837
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:47,789
Alvin, you don't decide.

838
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,042
- Why didn't the airbags deploy?
- Theodore, don't go into the light.

839
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:08,042
- Let's do it again.
- Awesome.

840
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:10,155
- Playing hard?
- Oh, yes.

841
01:04:10,323 --> 01:04:12,052
Good.

842
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:17,094
Because tomorrow, you start working hard.
Coast to coast in five days.

843
01:04:17,296 --> 01:04:20,595
Well, Dave says that touring is no life
for a kid.

844
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,496
For a normal kid.
You guys are superstars.

845
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:25,661
- Yes.
- Which reminds me...

846
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:28,739
...Simon, let's get rid of these
boring glasses.

847
01:04:29,242 --> 01:04:35,181
And try on these super cool
in-the-now glasses.

848
01:04:35,348 --> 01:04:37,248
Oh, my God, oh.

849
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:40,409
These would be great
if I could see out of them.

850
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:44,454
Your eyes will adjust.
Come on, boys. Let's hit the road.

851
01:04:44,624 --> 01:04:46,091
- Shotgun.
- Hit the road.

852
01:04:46,259 --> 01:04:47,817
Alvin...

853
01:05:38,244 --> 01:05:40,940
Give me a big fella. Alvin, big, big.

854
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:44,980
No hiding. Come on, come on.
Make love to the camera.

855
01:05:45,151 --> 01:05:50,282
Sell it. Big smile. Yes.
Theodore, chin out. Yeah. That's it.

856
01:05:50,456 --> 01:05:53,323
Good stuff. There you go.
Come on, get in there.

857
01:05:53,493 --> 01:05:55,518
Strong. Give me some booty.

858
01:05:55,695 --> 01:05:58,926
Spank it. There you got it.
Now you got it.

859
01:06:06,139 --> 01:06:10,701
If the Chipmunks like Crunchy Nibbles,
your pet will love them.

860
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:12,605
Cut.

861
01:06:13,112 --> 01:06:14,943
Here we are.

862
01:06:16,649 --> 01:06:18,446
Okay? All right?

863
01:07:01,961 --> 01:07:03,223
Hold it.

864
01:07:03,396 --> 01:07:04,522
We're not done.

865
01:07:04,697 --> 01:07:05,994
- You tell me.
- Killing me.

866
01:07:06,165 --> 01:07:08,224
- What do you want?
- You are killing me here.

867
01:07:08,401 --> 01:07:11,268
There's no button I can push
that wakes them to sing notes.

868
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:13,370
You kidding?
There's 5000 buttons here.

869
01:07:13,539 --> 01:07:16,337
- What button do you want me to push?
- Fine. I've got it.

870
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:22,340
All right, guys. Guess what your
uncle Ian brought you. Coffee.

871
01:07:23,382 --> 01:07:25,111
I love toffee.

872
01:07:25,284 --> 01:07:30,847
No, it's coffee, Theodore, coffee. It's a...
Like a super cool energy health drink...

873
01:07:31,023 --> 01:07:37,895
...with whipped cream and caramel
and two pumps of chocolate.

874
01:07:38,231 --> 01:07:40,096
Enjoy.

875
01:07:42,602 --> 01:07:44,433
That ought to keep them awake.

876
01:08:29,515 --> 01:08:31,449
<i>- Get munk'd
- Go, go, go</i>

877
01:08:31,617 --> 01:08:34,984
<i>Yeah, Chipmunks
Always can get munk'd</i>

878
01:08:35,154 --> 01:08:36,917
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

879
01:08:37,089 --> 01:08:39,353
<i>Come and get munk'd
With the Chipmunk rugrats</i>

880
01:08:39,558 --> 01:08:43,085
<i>Come and get munk'd with the Munks
Get munk'd with the Chipmunk rugrats</i>

881
01:08:43,262 --> 01:08:44,923
<i>Come and get munk'd with the Munks</i>

882
01:08:45,097 --> 01:08:48,828
Stop, stop. Come on, guys.
We need more energy, okay?

883
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:53,700
We need more dry ice. We need more,
you know, wow. All right?

884
01:08:53,873 --> 01:08:55,841
We're the Chipmunks,
for crying out loud.

885
01:08:56,008 --> 01:08:58,806
This is absurd.
I feel like P. Diddy with fur.

886
01:08:58,978 --> 01:09:02,641
And to be honest, the new songs
don't really sound like us.

887
01:09:02,815 --> 01:09:06,478
Well, you know what I think? I think
the new direction is perfect, you know.

888
01:09:06,652 --> 01:09:08,677
It's all about today's edge.

889
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:11,049
Dave always said
it was all about the music.

890
01:09:11,223 --> 01:09:12,520
"Dave always said..."

891
01:09:12,692 --> 01:09:17,823
You know what? Dave, Dave, Dave.
Dave is not here, okay? It's me.

892
01:09:17,997 --> 01:09:21,899
It's fun Uncle Ian, all right? Okay?

893
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:27,066
What are you...? What are you
gonna say? What's your name?

894
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:30,174
- Taffy.
- Taffy? What kind of name is Taffy?

895
01:09:30,343 --> 01:09:31,708
What do you do?

896
01:09:31,877 --> 01:09:34,869
- Choreography.
- I don't know what "choreography" is.

897
01:09:35,047 --> 01:09:37,641
- What is that?
- It's dance.

898
01:09:37,817 --> 01:09:43,551
Oh, is it dancing? Well, next time say,
you know, "I'm the dance guy..." Hello?

899
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:47,551
Who? Dave Seville.

900
01:09:48,027 --> 01:09:50,222
Name rings a bell. A dead...

901
01:09:50,563 --> 01:09:51,689
<i>... broken bell.</i>

902
01:09:51,864 --> 01:09:55,197
<i>- Just let me talk to the guys.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.</i>

903
01:09:55,368 --> 01:09:58,826
The boys are still stinging a little bit
from you kicking them out.

904
01:09:59,005 --> 01:10:02,168
- That's not what happened.
- Denial.

905
01:10:02,341 --> 01:10:04,741
So, what's this I hear
about a European tour?

906
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:07,435
You're taking them away
for six months?

907
01:10:07,646 --> 01:10:10,706
No, 12 actually.
If we can get China to go chipmunk.

908
01:10:10,883 --> 01:10:12,612
Twelve?

909
01:10:12,785 --> 01:10:15,879
Look, I just wanted to say hi.
See how they're doing.

910
01:10:16,055 --> 01:10:18,046
They're doing great.
They're loving life.

911
01:10:18,224 --> 01:10:19,691
<i>Living large.</i>

912
01:10:19,859 --> 01:10:23,022
Face it, Dave. They've moved on.

913
01:10:23,195 --> 01:10:26,221
- They're happy now.
- Look, Ian, I wanna talk to them.

914
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:27,457
<i>Put them on the phone.</i>

915
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:30,100
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen, Dave.

916
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:32,237
<i>Got a world tour,
gonna start tomorrow.</i>

917
01:10:32,405 --> 01:10:34,635
And these guys don't need
the extra pressure.

918
01:10:34,807 --> 01:10:37,367
<i>- We'll send you a postcard.
- Ian, you can't do this.</i>

919
01:10:37,543 --> 01:10:40,603
They're not ready for something
like that. They're just kids.

920
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,749
- I'm gonna see them.
- Look, Dave, I'm... Wait.

921
01:10:43,916 --> 01:10:45,042
<i>- Ian?
- Yeah? What?</i>

922
01:10:45,217 --> 01:10:47,242
- Ian.
- I can't...

923
01:10:53,993 --> 01:10:55,483
Ian...

924
01:10:55,694 --> 01:10:57,321
...was that Dave?

925
01:11:00,332 --> 01:11:03,392
Yes. Yes, it was.

926
01:11:03,569 --> 01:11:06,231
He wanted me to let you know
he's great and he's happy.

927
01:11:06,405 --> 01:11:09,272
He's really, really happy. So... All right.

928
01:11:09,442 --> 01:11:12,138
And is he coming to the show?

929
01:11:14,647 --> 01:11:18,640
You know what? I sent him tickets.
And here's the thing, he sent them back.

930
01:11:18,818 --> 01:11:23,949
Yeah, I know. I guess he's busy,
you know. Got better things to do.

931
01:11:24,123 --> 01:11:26,523
Hey, come on.
What's with the long furry faces?

932
01:11:26,725 --> 01:11:29,091
We're gonna have fun.
We're gonna have a big show.

933
01:11:29,261 --> 01:11:32,492
I'll tell you what, you guys like
deep-tissue massage? All right?

934
01:11:32,665 --> 01:11:35,361
I know a guy. Let me call my guy.
I'll get on that.

935
01:11:35,801 --> 01:11:38,326
Hey, captain, come here.

936
01:11:38,504 --> 01:11:39,630
Listen.

937
01:11:39,805 --> 01:11:43,332
Dave Seville.
Learn the name, look for the face.

938
01:11:43,509 --> 01:11:46,706
If he shows up tomorrow night,
he doesn't get near my chipmunks.

939
01:11:46,879 --> 01:11:49,780
- Got it? Okay.
- Got it.

940
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:05,290
Uncle Ian?

941
01:12:12,004 --> 01:12:15,167
- What are you doing here?
- Can I sleep with you?

942
01:12:15,341 --> 01:12:16,706
I had a nightmare.

943
01:12:17,143 --> 01:12:20,408
Oh, you had a nightmare?

944
01:12:20,579 --> 01:12:23,742
I had a nightmare too.
In my nightmare...

945
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:30,321
...I had to put together 37 dates
in 42 days, in 16 different countries.

946
01:12:30,489 --> 01:12:35,654
And I had to coordinate 121
different radio and print interviews...

947
01:12:35,828 --> 01:12:38,194
...in five different languages.

948
01:12:38,364 --> 01:12:41,231
But you know what, Theo?
The only difference is...

949
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:46,929
...in my nightmare, when I open
my eyes, it doesn't end.

950
01:12:47,106 --> 01:12:50,166
So is that a no?

951
01:13:20,973 --> 01:13:22,634
Guys...

952
01:13:22,942 --> 01:13:24,807
...I wanna go home.

953
01:13:24,977 --> 01:13:27,309
What do you mean? You are home.

954
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:30,141
No, I mean, "home" home.

955
01:13:30,349 --> 01:13:32,374
You know, with Dave.

956
01:13:32,551 --> 01:13:36,248
But, Theodore, come on.
Wake up and smell the toffee.

957
01:13:36,422 --> 01:13:42,418
Dave doesn't even want us. He doesn't
care enough to even come to our show.

958
01:13:44,263 --> 01:13:47,630
<i>Here's Julianne Reynolds
with today's entertainment news.</i>

959
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,268
<i>Too tired to rock?
The Chipmunks might be.</i>

960
01:13:50,436 --> 01:13:54,497
<i>Rumor of exhaustion and voice strain are
swirling around the singing sensation.</i>

961
01:13:54,673 --> 01:13:58,837
<i>Is it because of toaster waffle overload?
Or a rigorous tour schedule?</i>

962
01:13:59,011 --> 01:14:02,503
<i>It's hard to say. But manager-producer
Ian Hawke has assured Fox...</i>

963
01:14:02,681 --> 01:14:05,081
<i>... the trio will make
their first stop tonight...</i>

964
01:14:05,251 --> 01:14:10,985
<i>... on their highly anticipated world tour
at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles.</i>

965
01:14:13,025 --> 01:14:14,652
That's it.

966
01:14:35,281 --> 01:14:36,942
Okay.

967
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,783
You three sound like
you've been gargling nails.

968
01:14:45,924 --> 01:14:48,552
- I'll cover for you.
- Thank you.

969
01:14:49,695 --> 01:14:51,526
Can we get Wardrobe
down here, please?

970
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:53,289
Well?

971
01:14:53,465 --> 01:14:58,198
I could give you a lot of fancy terms,
but, bottom line, they're exhausted.

972
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:02,136
Okay, well, give them a shot
or a cream or a pill or something.

973
01:15:02,308 --> 01:15:05,641
I've invested every dime I have
in these guys.

974
01:15:05,811 --> 01:15:08,245
They need a long rest.

975
01:15:08,447 --> 01:15:12,747
A long rest. Are you...? Okay.
Yeah, a long rest, right.

976
01:15:13,052 --> 01:15:15,350
Right, yeah. I'm not a doctor, so...

977
01:15:15,521 --> 01:15:18,319
I'll get them that rest. Thank you.
I'll take care of it.

978
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:21,391
Thank you so much. I will...
I appreciate it. Hey, hey, doc.

979
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,755
Chipmunk fever, catch it.

980
01:15:25,898 --> 01:15:27,763
Knock, knock.

981
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,597
So listen, guys,
I just talked to the doctor.

982
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:34,830
And I don't feel right about
sending you guys out like this.

983
01:15:35,474 --> 01:15:37,567
So you're gonna cancel the show?

984
01:15:38,177 --> 01:15:41,237
No. No,
then I'd have to give out refunds.

985
01:15:41,413 --> 01:15:45,679
No. What I'm talking about
is having you guys lip-synch. Yeah.

986
01:15:45,851 --> 01:15:47,284
Isn't that like cheating?

987
01:15:47,486 --> 01:15:51,115
No, it's not like cheating. It's...
Cheating is wrong.

988
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:54,589
This is more like helping.
Yeah, all the superstars do it.

989
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:58,696
Just make sure that you mouth the
words exactly like we recorded them.

990
01:15:58,864 --> 01:16:01,594
- Otherwise, people will know.
- That we're cheating.

991
01:16:03,235 --> 01:16:07,137
- No.
- Guys, what other choice do we have?

992
01:16:07,306 --> 01:16:10,605
Yeah. See?
That's why he's the one with the letter.

993
01:16:10,776 --> 01:16:12,744
All right, guys, tighten up.

994
01:16:12,911 --> 01:16:18,281
And remember, mouth the words
and no one will know.

995
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,042
Love you.

996
01:16:29,094 --> 01:16:30,425
<i>You know you got it made</i>

997
01:16:30,596 --> 01:16:32,826
<i>When you drop your Escalade
For the drop top</i>

998
01:16:33,031 --> 01:16:35,591
<i>Iced out, rocks hot
Droppin' dollars, ladies holler</i>

999
01:16:35,768 --> 01:16:40,102
<i>Hey, gotta get that cream</i>

1000
01:16:40,272 --> 01:16:42,740
<i>You know you got it made
When they send in a parade</i>

1001
01:16:42,908 --> 01:16:45,001
<i>When you drop down
Write a check in town</i>

1002
01:16:45,177 --> 01:16:47,941
<i>All just for one day</i>

1003
01:16:48,113 --> 01:16:51,674
<i>Gotta get that cream</i>

1004
01:16:55,454 --> 01:17:01,086
<i>- Don't you know that's how they roll?
- Roll, roll, roll</i>

<i>Can you get down with the
Funk, funk, funk of the Chipmunks?</i>

1006
01:17:07,065 --> 01:17:08,259
<i>Baby, you know</i>

1007
01:17:08,434 --> 01:17:12,495
<i>Funk, funk, funk of the Chipmunks</i>

1008
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:21,339
Oh, come on,
you gotta have one more ticket.

1009
01:17:21,513 --> 01:17:22,878
Sorry.

1010
01:17:23,816 --> 01:17:25,841
<i>Come on, here's Theodore</i>

1016
01:17:41,867 --> 01:17:46,668
I love it. You love it? Chipmunk fever.
Catch it, baby.

1017
01:17:50,409 --> 01:17:51,535
Dave Seville.

1018
01:17:52,411 --> 01:17:55,209
No, there's no Dave Seville
on this list.

1019
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:59,043
<i>You know what? That's fine.
I'm the editor of the L.A. Music Journal.</i>

1020
01:17:59,218 --> 01:18:01,186
- No, I don't think so.
- He's with me.

1021
01:18:02,521 --> 01:18:04,512
He's my assistant.

1022
01:18:05,624 --> 01:18:06,750
Okay.

1023
01:18:07,226 --> 01:18:08,318
Thanks, Claire.

1024
01:18:08,494 --> 01:18:10,928
What's going on, Dave?
What are you...?

1025
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:16,932
I gotta get my boys back
but Ian's trying to keep me out.

1026
01:18:17,135 --> 01:18:18,329
Your boys.

1027
01:18:18,871 --> 01:18:21,431
I know that probably sounds weird
coming from me.

1028
01:18:22,074 --> 01:18:23,837
It's a good weird, though.

1029
01:18:24,343 --> 01:18:27,437
Because after all I did to mess up
everything, including you...

1030
01:18:27,646 --> 01:18:32,743
- Dave, your boys. We should go.
- Right. Okay.

If you're gonna do something,
do it fast. Here.

1036
01:18:49,968 --> 01:18:52,198
- You're press, remember?
- Thanks.

1037
01:18:52,371 --> 01:18:57,240
<i>Roll</i>

1038

Alvin!

1042

- Dave! He's here.
- It's Dave.

1043
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,461
What's going on?

1044
01:19:23,635 --> 01:19:25,296
Alvin, what are you doing?

1045
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:28,303
I'm sending a message
to our dear old uncle Ian.

1046
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:31,806
- Sounds like a plan to me.
- Me too.

1047
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,610
Come on, guys.

1048
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:42,211
Hey, Ian...

1049
01:19:43,322 --> 01:19:46,120
...kiss my furry cheeks.

1050
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,592
Here, hold on to that.

1051

Top of the morning to you.

1052
01:19:58,804 --> 01:20:00,601
Get off my set.

1053
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:03,640
Are you ready to rock?

1054
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:06,204
Turn it up, girl.

- Look out. Run.

1062
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,735
Hi.

1063
01:20:36,908 --> 01:20:38,170
Bye.

01:20:49,921 --> 01:20:53,254
- Sorry.
- Come on, big fella. Come on. Come on.

1068
01:20:53,425 --> 01:20:55,256
A little bit closer.

1069
01:20:55,427 --> 01:20:58,419
Come on, right there. Perfect.

1070
01:20:59,531 --> 01:21:02,022
He'll feel that in the morning.

1071
01:21:03,902 --> 01:21:06,666
- Guys.
- Dave!

1072
01:21:07,873 --> 01:21:10,171
You're not going anywhere.

1073
01:21:10,809 --> 01:21:11,867
What are you doing?

1074
01:21:12,044 --> 01:21:14,444
- Put us down.
- Let me go.

1075
01:21:14,613 --> 01:21:16,444
- Hey.
- You better study your French.

1076
01:21:16,615 --> 01:21:20,051
- You're going to Paris tonight. Okay?
- Let go. Just had my tail redone.

1077
01:21:20,218 --> 01:21:21,776
- No, wait.
- Put it with my stuff.

1078
01:21:21,953 --> 01:21:24,751
- Let us out of here. Let us out of here.
- No.

1079
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:27,892
What? Ian, they don't want this anymore.
Just let them go.

1080
01:21:28,927 --> 01:21:32,863
But the guy just left. You should have
said something about five seconds ago.

1081
01:21:33,031 --> 01:21:34,623
Come back.

1082
01:21:35,467 --> 01:21:39,767
Ian, they need a real life.
Not all of this.

1083
01:21:39,938 --> 01:21:42,372
Besides, they just ruined the concert.

1084
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:46,102
Word will get out,
no one will come to see them.

1085
01:21:46,745 --> 01:21:52,115
Dave, they're chipmunks who talk.
People will come.

1086
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:54,316
Guys, with me.

You'll never take us alive.

1089
01:22:09,901 --> 01:22:12,335
They just did take us alive, Alvin.

1090
01:22:12,504 --> 01:22:14,335
It's a figure of speech, Simon.

1091
01:22:14,506 --> 01:22:18,602
Instead of criticizing me, why not use
your big brain to think of a way out?

1092
01:22:31,423 --> 01:22:33,618
Go, go, go. Go.

1093
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:44,798
Come on.

1094
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:55,175
Step on it, Dave. You're losing him.

1095
01:23:04,956 --> 01:23:06,821
How did you guys...?

1096
01:23:06,992 --> 01:23:08,482
We are talking chipmunks, Dave.

1097
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:13,290
We can get out of a cat carrier.
Not even hard to do.

1098
01:23:13,465 --> 01:23:15,330
You came back for us.

1099
01:23:16,635 --> 01:23:20,071
Well, of course I came back.
We're a family.

1100
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:22,229
Holy nuts.

1101
01:23:23,074 --> 01:23:25,167
- What?
- Am I going crazy?

1102
01:23:25,343 --> 01:23:26,935
Or did he just say "family"?

1103
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:31,481
I know...

1104
01:23:33,185 --> 01:23:35,085
...but I really missed you guys.

1105
01:23:35,253 --> 01:23:37,244
I missed you too, Dave.

1106
01:23:39,491 --> 01:23:41,186
Me too.

1107
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:47,355
- So did Alvin. He's too cool to admit it.
- Yeah, too macho.

1108
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:51,363
Missed you too.

1109
01:23:51,536 --> 01:23:54,437
Sorry, I had some sentimentality
stuck in my throat.

1110
01:23:54,606 --> 01:23:58,702
I just said, I missed you too.

1111
01:23:58,877 --> 01:24:00,845
Whatever.
Who are you guys to judge me?

1112
01:24:01,012 --> 01:24:04,243
Okay, you know what?
I miss my friend Dave, okay?

1113
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:08,716
I'll scream it from the rooftops.
And I'm not afraid. I'm not ashamed.

1114
01:24:08,887 --> 01:24:12,050
That's right. I love you, Dave.

1115
01:24:14,626 --> 01:24:15,752
Come here.

1116
01:24:19,564 --> 01:24:21,589
- Dave?
- Yes, Alvin?

1117
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:24,428
Now can I steer?
Oh, please, please, please.

1118
01:24:24,603 --> 01:24:28,130
- I want to work the windshield wipers.
- Oh, and I'd like to beep the horn.

1119
01:24:28,306 --> 01:24:30,536
Have at it, fellas.

1120
01:24:31,776 --> 01:24:34,438
- I'm a good beeper.
- Save some horn for the rest of us.

1121
01:24:34,613 --> 01:24:37,741
- Come on, Dave, drive faster.
- Not with you steering.

1122
01:24:37,916 --> 01:24:40,077
Dave, you drive like a sleepy old bear.

1123
01:24:40,252 --> 01:24:43,244
- Okay, Alvin, that's enough.
- Enough of what? Of being awesome?

1124
01:24:43,421 --> 01:24:44,752
Alvin, I said that's enough.

1125
01:24:44,923 --> 01:24:47,448
Hey, look, Dave, no paws.

1126
01:24:49,594 --> 01:24:55,089
Hey, if you guys behave, maybe
I'll let you call me "Uncle Ian" again.

1127
01:24:55,267 --> 01:24:56,825
Deal?

1128
01:25:16,922 --> 01:25:23,623
No!

1129
01:25:30,835 --> 01:25:32,359
Claire.

1130
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:33,628
- Hey.
- Come on in.

1131
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,006
- Hi, Claire.
- Well, hello, Clarina.

1132
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:40,167
- Hi, guys.
- Hope you like toaster waffles.

1133
01:25:40,578 --> 01:25:44,480
And, for us classy chipmunks,
a bit of the bubbly.

1134
01:25:45,483 --> 01:25:48,475
Stupid cork. Doesn't...

1135
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,094
I'm not gonna say it.

1136
01:25:58,663 --> 01:25:59,721
Good grief.

1137
01:26:01,466 --> 01:26:03,491
Are you still not gonna say it?

1138
01:26:03,668 --> 01:26:04,828
Nope.

1139
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:15,070
I'm gonna say it. Alvin!

1140
01:26:15,246 --> 01:26:17,111
Okay!

1141
01:26:30,929 --> 01:26:33,227
Okay, guys, come on,
let's try it again.

1142
01:26:33,398 --> 01:26:36,026
Here we go, and sing.

1143
01:26:36,201 --> 01:26:41,002
Come on, sing for your uncle Ian.
Come on, sing.

1144
01:26:41,172 --> 01:26:43,766
Why...? Why won't you sing?

1145
01:26:43,942 --> 01:26:46,342
You know, I said, sing.

1146
01:26:46,511 --> 01:26:48,536
Sing.

1147
01:31:11,042 --> 01:31:13,033
[ENGLISH]

1148
01:31:14,305 --> 01:32:14,496
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
