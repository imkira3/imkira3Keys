00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,093
<i>This is Lieutenant Dreyfus,</i>

3
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,517
<i>badge number 3525, at 174 Willow Lane.</i>

4
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,856
Now entering what appears to be
the living room.

5
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,606
Living conditions are best described as

6
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,275
being in a state of disarray.
Watch your step.

7
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,402
Kitchen also in a state of disarray.

8
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,240
Approaching the stairwell
where first victim was found.

9
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,912
Note the instrument on the floor.

10
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:05,422
Victim number one is facing north.

11
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,930
Male, approximately 160 pounds.

12
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,767
Sustained injury to the left temple.

13
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:17,934
Now entering the basement

14
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,812
where victims number two and three
were found.

15
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,533
Entered the basement of the house.

16
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,871
We find victim number two.

17
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,868
Female, approximately 120 pounds.

18
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,711
Facing west.

19
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,798
In the victim's right hand,
we have religious paraphernalia,

20
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,709
apparently is clutching.

21
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,304
Heading south

22
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:56,139
we find another instrument on the floor.

23
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,314
We find victim number three.

24
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:08,318
Male, approximately 210 pounds.

25
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,489
We have trauma to the head.

26
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,822
Apparent strangulation with rope,

27
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,830
which is broken or torn away.

28
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,834
We have blood splattering
against the door.

29
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,762
In the center of the room,
we have a chair.

30
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,517
The right armrest of the chair is broken

31
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:40,353
with apparent claw marks
from a struggle.

32
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,687
Various straps used for restraint.

33
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,290
<i>WJBP, Channel 11.</i>

34
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,754
A quiet South Hartford community

35
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,428
was leveled by tragedy as
three clergy members were found dead.

36
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,256
At about 11:47 p.m.
on Sunday evening, the 20th,

37
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,684
we received an emergency call
on our 911 line.

38
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,434
<i>At least three bodies
were taken out of this house,</i>

39
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,105
<i>two local priests and a nun.</i>

40
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,934
We checked the location for any
other victims and have not found any.

41
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,982
<i>Apparently,
Maria Rossi was hosting</i>

42
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,778
<i>a church group meeting at her home.</i>

43
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,482
Our homicide detectives
and our lab people

44
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,657
<i>are conducting their investigation.</i>

45
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,236
<i>Mrs. Rossi was found
by police in a crawl space.</i>

46
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,404
We can't speculate <i>as</i> to what

47
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,156
<i>the cause or the motive may have been.</i>

48
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,082
They are not ruling out any possibilities.

49
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,412
<i>However, at this time,
we don't want to speculate</i>

50
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,374
<i>on what may or may not have been
the cause.</i>

51
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,925
<i>My name is Isabella Rossi</i>

52
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,386
and that was my mother.

53
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,386
<i>The thing you have to understand
about my mother</i>

54
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,392
is that she just had a huge heart.

55
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,935
<i>Down came the rain
and washed the spider out</i>

56
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,111
<i>Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain</i>

57
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,613
And there we are.
That was actually on my...

58
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,285
Can you see that?

59
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,951
That was my first birthday party.

60
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,123
<i>And I don't think it was until I was</i>

61
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,170
about six years old that
I actually started to notice, you know,

62
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,668
<i>something was different,
her moods were changing.</i>

63
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,215
<i>Then, she went away for a little bit</i>

64
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,258
<i>and when she came back
they said she was better.</i>

65
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,171
But she wasn't.

66
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,631
<i>We couldn't understand
what was happening.</i>

67
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,136
<i>No one had answers.</i>

68
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,639
So why are you doing this film?

69
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,805
Because I really need to

70
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,318
understand what happened.

71
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,321
What Maria Rossi did,
and her subsequent life,

72
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,784
was incredibly tragic and clouded.

73
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:07,493
And caught in the middle of it
is a daughter who is just now learning

74
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,374
<i>the circumstances of that tragedy.</i>

75
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,005
<i>Isabella,
look at the camera, honey.</i>

76
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,213
<i>If someone had asked me</i>

77
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:19,718
how is it possible for Mrs. Rossi
to have done what she did,

78
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,517
I would have gone through the list
of things that cause human aggression.

79
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,012
Something like major depression,
or schizophrenia,

80
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,393
<i>or dissociative identity disorder.</i>

81
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,724
<i>It's my understanding</i>

82
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,856
that her current psychiatric diagnosis
has been D.I.D.

83
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:38,653
But this is her seventh different
diagnosis since 1987.

84
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,574
<i>You start wondering,
is it in my genes?</i>

85
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,661
You know,
am I going to flip out one day?

86
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,541
<i>Just a matter of time?</i>

87
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,880
Two years after she brutally murdered
three people in her home,

88
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,172
a South Hartford jury

89
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,343
<i>found Maria Rossi not guilty
by reason of insanity.</i>

90
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,464
Rossi was committed
to the South Hartford State Asylum.

91
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,173
<i>And then in September
of that year,</i>

92
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,424
<i>my mother was transferred</i>

93
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,262
to the Centrino Mental Hospital
for the Criminally Insane in Rome, Italy.

94
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,690
<i>I never really questioned why Italy.</i>

95
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,901
When did your father tell you
what really happened?

96
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:22,409
May 23, 2009. I was 25 years old.

97
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,699
<i>He just said it. He said,</i>

98
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,208
"Mom attacked those people
during an exorcism."

99
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,750
An exorcism performed on her.

100
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,960
It's the job of science to try to sort out

101
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,508
what is a reasonable,
plausible explanation.

102
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,794
But science can't explain everything,

103
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,003
such as a person

104
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,806
levitating two feet off the ground
during an exorcism.

105
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,020
I asked my dad if he thought
she was possessed.

106
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,267
He said he didn't know.

107
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,601
That she was gone. It didn't matter.

108
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,444
Not any more.

109
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,399
He died three days later.

110
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,368
<i>I called the church
where the priests had come from.</i>

111
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,664
<i>And they wouldn't talk about it.</i>

112
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,789
<i>They said they don't have
an ordained exorcist and never did.</i>

113
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:18,124
So we're on our way to see
the Vatican School for Exorcism.

114
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,466
And to see my mother.

115
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,136
Are you nervous?

116
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,141
Yeah, I'm nervous.
Twenty years is a long time, you know?

117
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,471
<i>So, later, I was contacted
by the Diocese of Rome.</i>

118
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:36,309
<i>They told me they never authorized
my mother's exorcism.</i>

119
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,815
<i>That's when I knew I had to go to Italy.</i>

120
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,624
I wonder how seriously they take
the exorcism school, you know.

121
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,961
I hope it's not a joke.

122
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,466
Oh, wow.

123
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,476
There it is, St. Peter's Square.

124
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,150
Something like that.

125
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:29,448
<i>This school has drawn
a lot of interest from all over the world.</i>

126
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,166
<i>Maybe it can help me understand
my mother's situation a little better.</i>

127
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,411
From
post-traumatic shock to serious injury,

128
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,837
death even.

129
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,836
And not just for the victim.

130
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,925
Also for the family members,
for anyone in the vicinity,

131
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,005
especially the priest.

132
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,350
Sometimes a person

133
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,354
can be tormented
by more than one demon

134
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,524
in what we call
multiple demonic possession.

135
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,520
These cases are extremely
volatile and dangerous,

136
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,524
and they sometimes
lead to transference,

137
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,536
which means
the demon jumps from one person

138
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,280
to another.

139
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:19,040
The purpose of the class
is to educate priests

140
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,416
and, of course, laypeople,

141
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,749
about the Devil's presence in their lives,
in modern society.

142
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,963
<i>For example, in Italy alone</i>

143
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,966
<i>there are over 800 satanic cults
We had a problem.</i>

144
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,013
We needed more exorcists.

145
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,592
<i>If it is possession,
then first and foremost</i>

146
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,518
<i>we must rule out mental illness.</i>

147
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,641
<i>Schizophrenia. Bipolar disorder.</i>

148
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:41,183
<i>The course is designed
to explore all these conditions.</i>

149
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,915
Momma.

150
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,477
Okay, anyone, any thoughts on that?

151
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,271
I believe the subject
was clearly possessed.

152
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,148
The subject
spoke in multiple languages.

153
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,781
Come on. Speaking in tongues? Maybe.

154
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:35,534
Incoherent babbling from
a mentally-disturbed person, certainly.

155
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,904
I'm sorry, Father.

156
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,911
And the subject displayed
abnormal strength

157
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,994
when confronted with holy water,
and while heavily sedated.

158
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,750
The delusional mind
of a paranoid schizophrenic

159
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,212
may actually react to holy water
as if it were,

160
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,885
I don't know, acid, urine.

161
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,304
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to disagree.

162
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,304
The girl fractured her own femur.

163
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,479
Her strength might have been abnormal,
but not impossible.

164
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,022
It's very well known that

165
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,815
some epileptics do break their bones
during a seizure. It's a fact.

166
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,656
As I said, we must be sure
to rule out mental illness.

167
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:16,327
In the end, this case
could not be proved as possession.

168
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,330
<i>- The diversity of the class
was comforting.</i>

169
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,750
<i>It wasn't just priests or nuns,
but regular people,</i>

170
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,499
<i>people who are facing
the same things I'm facing.</i>

171
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,832
<i>People like me,
looking to help someone.</i>

172
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,009
So why are you here?

173
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,047
All this knowledge, you all agree on this,

174
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,133
all this knowledge
is invaluable for us, no?

175
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,302
David, what would you say
drew you to this school?

176
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,559
In particular, to exorcism?

177
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,731
The combination
of science and religion.

178
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,609
I think,
based on my background in medicine,

179
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,736
it gave me a greater sense of purpose.

180
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:57,820
We all talk so definitively
about God and about the Devil

181
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:03,875
but we can all agree that there's
no real facts, right? No proofs?

182
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,754
God has never helped me.
What about you?

183
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,417
Sure. Yeah.

184
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:17,221
So when do you actually witness
an exorcism in class?

185
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,424
This class is all theory.

186
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,101
This is a school of exorcism, is it not?

187
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,725
It's not reality.

188
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,934
Look at the tape we watched today.

189
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:34,072
That girl fit every criteria for possession
except she wasn't.

190
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,524
It's a mental disorder.

191
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,576
No. When you witness
someone possessed,

192
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,153
you'll know the difference.

193
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,330
You say that like you have.

194
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,375
Have you witnessed a real exorcism,
Father?

195
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:51,585
Yeah. Right after he saw
the Easter Bunny.

196
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,508
I may have.
Can I ask you something, Isabella?

197
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,052
- Sure.
- I'm curious.

198
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,259
Why are you doing this documentary?

199
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,803
I will be honest. My mom.

200
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,307
When I was about eight years old

201
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,272
she murdered three people.

202
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,611
Members of her church.

203
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:20,322
I found out that she had committed
these murders during an exorcism.

204
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,655
An exorcism on her.

205
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,828
- See you.
- It was nice meeting you.

206
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,869
Your mother must be at Centrino, right?

207
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,793
- Have you seen her yet?
- Tomorrow.

208
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,260
Okay, well, the class
won't give you the answers you need.

209
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,383
You need to see a real one.

210
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,215
How do you know when it's real?

211
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,637
You know.

212
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,222
Good luck.

213
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,019
Thanks.

214
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,481
That was interesting.

215
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,493
- Hey.
- What are you looking at?

216
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,289
My mother's hospital instruction manual.

217
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,491
Look at this thing, it's huge.

218
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,826
Okay.

219
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,796
So, camera one, two and three.

220
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,498
Which one do I look at?

221
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,049
You don't have to look
directly at the camera.

222
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,468
Right. I knew that.

223
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,462
Remember, the cameras
are always running when the car's on.

224
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,593
Let's go.

225
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:26,973
You know,
my father received a letter from Rome.

226
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:31,731
I guess because priests were involved.
The Holy Church got involved <i>as</i> well.

227
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,647
And they said that they wanted to
treat my mother at Centrino.

228
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,897
They called it

229
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,438
an "offering of forgiveness."

230
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,151
And I remember thinking that meant
God was forgiving my mother.

231
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,245
I was young.

232
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,199
Okay.

233
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,100
- No camera.
- Show him the media pass.

234
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,299
<i>It felt like a prison.</i>

235
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,218
An old prison, really.

236
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:47,553
But Dr. Costa seemed concerned,
so that was good.

237
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,468
Uh... Follow me.

238
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,186
I only show you this because your
mother has not had a violent outburst

239
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,020
in over 7 years.

240
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,835
She's extraordinarily anti-religious.

241
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:19,627
We refrain from religious items
and discussion at all times.

242
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,340
They can make her hostile.

243
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,255
But I want to put...

244
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,399
That's enough.

245
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,942
I'm not sure if you knew this, doctor,

246
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,565
but my mother was involved
in an exorcism

247
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,195
while she committed those murders.

248
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,322
Did you know that?

249
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,280
Isabella, your mother's case,
although unique,

250
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,116
<i>is not a matter of demonic possession.</i>

251
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,873
It's a matter of brain function.

252
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:01,798
So why do you think she was transferred
all the way from the States to Rome?

253
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,136
I don't know.
It was before I arrived here.

254
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,145
Unfortunately,
we've had to keep her heavily medicated.

255
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,316
An exhaustive amount of meds,
to be honest.

256
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,484
Anti psychotics.

257
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,484
Sedatives. Anti-anxiety.

258
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,486
It constantly changes.

259
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,819
She is a very, very complex patient.

260
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,674
Miss Rossi, let's keep moving.

261
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:58,013
She is having a very good day today.
But there still are rules.

262
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:02,271
Don't talk about faith or God.
And stay passive.

263
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,276
Hostility and aggression are...
Well, they've provoked her in the past.

264
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,450
Just precautions. It will be fine.

265
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,541
In fact, there is a very good chance
she won't even recognize you.

266
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,128
Maria?

267
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,462
You have a visitor.

268
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,728
Come. Come.

269
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,261
Hi, Mom.

270
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,848
I like your drawings.

271
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:28,611
Maria, I'd like to speak with you
if you'd let me, please.

272
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,940
My name is Isabella.

273
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,450
Isabella Rossi.

274
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,704
I'm your daughter.

275
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,136
I just haven't seen you in a long time.

276
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,140
Connect the cuts.

277
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,305
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.
Connect the cuts.

278
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,310
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.

279
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,313
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.

280
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,566
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.

281
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,824
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.

282
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,660
Do you recognize this?

283
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,502
Do you know
how to connect the cuts?

284
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,428
I don't know what that means.

285
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,842
Connect the cuts.

286
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,845
Did you do that to yourself?

287
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,142
Please stop.

288
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:57,108
Maria, I came a very long way
to see you.

289
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,074
Do you want to see my painting?

290
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,536
Yes. I'd like that. I'd love that.

291
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:19,593
Yes, yes. Maria, he was your husband.
You loved him very much.

292
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,009
Do you remember?

293
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,596
Who are you?

294
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,316
I'm Isabella. I'm your daughter.

295
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,440
- I don't have a daughter.
- Yes, yes, you do.

296
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,647
We just haven't seen each other
in a very long time.

297
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,232
I don't have a daughter.

298
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,077
Do I?

299
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,079
Why? Why?

300
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,919
Why not?

301
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:57,593
Well, thank you for coming.
Please say hello to your family from me.

302
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,889
Have a nice day. Thank you for coming.
I have to go. I have to go.

303
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,676
I have to get ready. I have to get ready.

304
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,346
I have to get ready. Get ready.

305
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:11,440
Get ready.

306
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,361
You shouldn't have killed.

307
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,195
What did you say?

308
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:26,448
Maria, please. I don't have a lot of time.
Please, tell me something.

309
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,163
You shouldn't have killed your child.

310
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,218
What?

311
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,990
It's against God's will, you know.

312
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,750
Out, out, out!

313
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,679
Shit, that was great.
That was great stuff.

314
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,183
Are you all right?

315
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,187
Isabella?

316
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,847
Isabella, I...

317
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,461
<i>What's it like,
losing both parents?</i>

318
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,717
<i>It feels empty.</i>

319
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,433
<i>Like there's no safety net
to fallback on.</i>

320
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,060
<i>And it forces you to be resilient.</i>

321
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,602
<i>Possession and exorcism
have dictated my life.</i>

322
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,234
<i>It took my mom
and it basically killed my dad.</i>

323
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,316
<i>It defines me now.</i>

324
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,197
<i>I mean, here I am</i>

325
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,827
<i>I flew halfway across...
You know, halfway across the world</i>

326
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,499
<i>to see this woman
who I never thought I'd see again.</i>

327
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,085
<i>I don't like that it defines me.</i>

328
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,753
<i>I contacted
Father Ben Rawlings and David Keane</i>

329
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:45,132
<i>in hopes that they would review
the footage of my mother.</i>

330
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,801
Luckily, they agreed
and invited me to their loft.

331
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,737
Isabella, hi, welcome.

332
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,073
- How are you?
- Good. Come in.

333
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:13,406
It's hard to say
why I wanted to be a priest.

334
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,742
<i>Maybe I was drawn to helping people.</i>

335
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:21,710
<i>I think that duality exists within all of
us and, occasionally, it can take form.</i>

336
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:26,837
<i>Science can no longer help,
and religion has to take over.</i>

337
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,964
Which can be really difficult
for people to accept.

338
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,225
Isabella, nice to see you again.
How are you? You okay? Okay, great.

339
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,061
- Can I get you a cup of tea or anything?
- Sure.

340
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,480
I'm sorry, I forgot your...

341
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,183
- Michael.
- Michael.

342
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,771
My family were always very religious.

343
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,821
My mother and father,
they were teachers,

344
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:50,367
but I was closest to my uncle.
He was a priest.

345
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,740
<i>By the time I was 13,
he told me that he was an exorcist.</i>

346
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,662
<i>And, well,</i>

347
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,999
if you can imagine...

348
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,670
It's like, I suppose, you know,
you being told that

349
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,176
your dad is Superman.

350
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:11,676
That's what it felt like to me.
That he was in direct,

351
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:15,597
you know, war, I suppose,
with the Devil.

352
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,723
And, I don't know,
it blew me away, really.

353
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:26,229
<i>And so, he took me along with him
and by the time I was 18,</i>

354
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,360
I'd seen four exorcisms.
I'd even assisted on one.

355
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,821
And it just changes you.

356
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,992
<i>Unfortunately, he passed away
a couple years ago.</i>

357
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,993
Anyway, when I was 23,
I went into the priesthood.

358
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,754
And by the time I was 27,
I was an ordained exorcist.

359
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,672
<i>But I'll tell you this.</i>

360
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,926
After all the years
that I've been in the Church

361
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,846
I've seen the Devil
way more than I've seen God.

362
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,473
That's just not the way
it's supposed to be.

363
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,516
There, what did she say to you there?

364
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,979
Oh, uh...

365
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,777
Yeah, at the end there,
she started remembering things,

366
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,697
specific things,
and she said something to me.

367
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,941
But I'm not sure if she said...

368
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,694
What? What was it?

369
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,870
I terminated a pregnancy
about four years ago.

370
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,459
The doctor said
I couldn't carry it to term, so...

371
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,705
Anyway, she knew about it,
and she said that...

372
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:31,044
Something about
being against God's will or something.

373
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,299
Hang on. Let's just look at that.

374
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,556
It's against God's will, you know.

375
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,845
That means something, right?

376
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,144
Possibly. You said you had
a copy of her medical charts?

377
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,345
Wait, wait, wait.

378
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:42,892
What are those?

379
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,062
Oh! She cuts herself.

380
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,485
Those are crosses, Ben.

381
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,405
Crosses? Wait, wouldn't she
not want crosses if she's possessed?

382
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,233
- Not necessarily.
- Look at them. Look at them.

383
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,819
The way that she's seeing them,
they're upside down.

384
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:01,078
They're inverted crosses.
They're typically used in Satanic rituals.

385
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,075
I don't have a daughter.

386
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,410
Wait, is she speaking
with an accent?

387
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,245
Yeah,
she did that some. Why?

388
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,330
Different accents can be like
speaking in tongues.

389
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,546
The pregnancy,
did you tell her about that at all?

390
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,672
No.

391
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,752
And you're absolutely sure

392
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,008
there's no other way
she could have found out?

393
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,182
I mean, there's no way.

394
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:22,057
See, there are basically four factors

395
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,935
when it comes to
determining demonic possession.

396
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,187
One, unnatural strength.

397
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,191
You got aversion to holy objects.

398
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,239
Languages or events
that they could not have known.

399
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,191
And preternatural movement,

400
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,992
which is basically
objects moving around the room.

401
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:46,206
So, strength? No. Languages, no.

402
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,959
Preternatural movement, no.
Aversion to holy objects, maybe.

403
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,711
Yeah, but there are accents
and, Ben, she knew that information.

404
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,633
Yeah, that interests me.

405
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,716
We need to show you something.

406
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,720
Okay. Can I bring the camera?

407
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,350
- Sure.
- All right.

408
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,560
Okay.

409
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,071
- Can I bring this?
- Yeah, of course. Come on through.

410
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,985
I'm good. I'm right behind you.
Keep going.

411
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,243
What is all this?
Who are these people?

412
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,500
These are people
the Church turned down for exorcism.

413
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:35,252
- And they're all possessed?
- We believe they are.

414
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,258
These two cases are resolved.
Those two are open

415
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,756
and we're almost done with this one.

416
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,681
This is the girl, Rosa, right?
From the video we saw in Gallo's class?

417
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,387
You both thought she was possessed.

418
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,440
She is.
We think the Church made a mistake.

419
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,478
So correct me if I'm wrong,

420
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:59,783
but you guys are performing
these exorcisms yourselves,

421
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,202
without the Church's permission?

422
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:06,783
That's right. We have to. Otherwise,
these people would continue to suffer.

423
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,585
What is all that?

424
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,167
We monitor everything.
Heart rate, blood pressure.

425
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,418
Yeah, go ahead.

426
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,342
That's a camera we use
to determine pupil dilation,

427
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,091
which is very important
in cases of possession.

428
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,432
Nine millimeters
is as large as the average pupil gets.

429
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,596
Maybe 10 or 11
under certain substances

430
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,019
like cocaine, psilocybin,
methamphetamines.

431
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,684
Anything above 11
is considered preternatural.

432
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,683
Why doesn't the Church
help these people?

433
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,063
You see, that's just it.

434
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,941
The Church isn't in the business
of healing people.

435
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,530
The bureaucracy won't allow it.

436
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,901
Their hands are tied. In 1999,
the Church changed the exorcism rites

437
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,361
for the first time in almost 400 years.

438
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,321
Now a priest has to be
absolutely certain

439
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,625
that there's an evil presence
in order to even attempt an exorcism.

440
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,373
And that's a near impossible task,
because a lot of the time

441
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,964
it takes an exorcism
for a demon to reveal itself.

442
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,838
But rather than get distracted
by the Church's hypocrisy,

443
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,882
we're going to
continue to care for these people.

444
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,970
So that means that my mother's case
can actually be something...

445
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,343
No, no. Isabella, you...

446
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,012
The Church will never pursue
your mother's case

447
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,844
because the last time someone did,
people died.

448
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,854
What do you suggest?

449
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,689
If you really want to help your mother,

450
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,017
you need a better understanding
of exorcism.

451
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,190
A real understanding.

452
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:22,358
Okay. So take more classes
and maybe show Gallo the tape?

453
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:27,618
Isabella, you'll learn more
in five minutes of an exorcism

454
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,620
than you will
in three months in some class.

455
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,204
Plus, you'll get to know
the real difference

456
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,912
between possession and mental illness.

457
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,135
So witness a real exorcism?

458
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,214
With you?

459
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,140
If you want.

460
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,560
So the exorcism rites,
when they were updated,

461
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,103
what exactly changed?

462
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,740
Well, for one, all media coverage
of exorcisms were banned.

463
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,155
Not that they were filmed much anyway.

464
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,154
Exorcisms can take minutes
or they can take years.

465
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,580
No two are the same.

466
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,418
Is this thing we're doing even legal?

467
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,167
No. Not exactly.

468
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,969
You never know what's going to happen.

469
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,279
So do you still get nervous or...

470
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,200
No, not really.

471
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,869
Demons, like angels, have orders,

472
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,993
or spheres, to be more specific.
A hierarchy, basically.

473
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:56,035
<i>Now, it's imperative you get the demon
to reveal itself so you can deduce</i>

474
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,664
its rank in that hierarchy.

475
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,963
<i>In our last session</i>

476
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,923
we were able to hone in
on our demon's identity.

477
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,090
His name is Berith.

478
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,965
Look, I know we went over this before.

479
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,092
Keep us between you and her, okay.
I'm not kidding.

480
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,468
All right, all right.

481
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,195
- Father.
- How is she?

482
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,410
- She's worse? Okay, let me see.
- No, no.

483
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:35,825
We had to move her downstairs.
To the basement.

484
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,751
The basement?

485
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,464
This is it.

486
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:47,006
We're actually going to see a person
who is supposedly possessed.

487
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:50,593
So I guess now we'll see
if it's bullshit or not.

488
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,899
She's in here.

489
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,401
Michael, come in.

490
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,404
Everyone, bow their heads.

491
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:12,570
May the Lord bless us and keep us.
May the Lord let His face shine upon us.

492
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,530
May the Lord lift up His countenance
onto us and give us peace.

493
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,873
- Amen.
- Amen.

494
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,208
This really is no place for her,
Mrs. Sorlini.

495
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,294
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
We don't know what to do.

496
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,169
Please, please, it's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

497
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,462
Rosa?

498
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:30,481
Bless you for your prayers.
You must leave her to us now. All right?

499
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,731
Yes, Father.

500
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,985
This is to help loosen her limbs,
keep her calm.

501
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,867
It's very similar to a muscle relaxant.

502
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,578
She's looking right at me.

503
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:20,864
Okay.

504
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,950
Okay.

505
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,210
Let's get set up.

506
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,155
It's best just to stay close
to Michael, okay?

507
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,409
- A little to the right.
- No, no. It's set.

508
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,166
It is Thursday,
December 3, 2009.

509
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,414
Subject, Rosa Sorlini.

510
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,838
Last session, November 13, 2009.

511
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,843
Rosa's appearance has worsened,
skin color and weight.

512
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,508
Temperament appears stable.

513
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,846
Vitals are slightly elevated,
but basically normal.

514
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,855
Her pupils are dilated
to approximately nine millimeters.

515
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,020
Okay.

516
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,198
Let's begin.

517
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,540
Pupils still normal.

518
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,376
Rosa, are you in there?
Can you hear me?

519
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,291
I want to know
how you're feeling today, Rosa.

520
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:01,549
I remember last time, Rosa,
you were strong. You spoke to me.

521
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,690
No, no, she's strong.
And getting stronger than...

522
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,777
You don't want this one any more.

523
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,609
It's no good for you.

524
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,697
She said my name.
She said my name.

525
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,372
- How did she know my name?
- Stay back. Don't listen to her.

526
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:32,795
Five minutes alone with her,
I promise you, her cunt will know me.

527
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,165
I want you to leave the girl
out of this.

528
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,797
I know who you are, demon!
Your name is Berith!

529
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,758
Behold the Cross of the Lord.

530
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,099
- Lord, have mercy.
- Lord, have mercy.

531
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,930
- Christ, have mercy.
- Christ, have mercy.

532
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,936
God, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ,

533
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,232
I appeal to Your Holy Name

534
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,436
that you graciously
grant me help against...

535
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,037
- That you graciously grant me help

536
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,332
against this unclean spirit
that's tormenting this creature of Yours!

537
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,000
- Ben, she's hemorrhaging!

538
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,203
God, creator and defender
of the human race,

539
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,629
who made man in Your own image,

540
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,002
look down in pity on this, Your servant!

541
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,918
Help me hold her down, Ben.
Ben, help me hold her down.

542
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:23,722
Taste it, bitch!
Come taste your mother's sweet milk!

543
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:24,888
Stay back.

544
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,644
Inserting anti-coagulant.

545
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,142
...overwhelms it with fear and panic.

546
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,232
Repel, O Lord, the Devil's power.

547
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,274
Break asunder his snares.
You can't hide, Berith!

548
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,654
The Mystery of the Cross
commands you!

549
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,488
Blood pressure's way up, 190 over 110!
Come on, hang in there!

550
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:53,577
Heart rate's up. So is blood pressure.
190 over 110. Hang in there.

551
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:06,340
Blood pressure's going crazy!
It's 220 over 110! Say it, Ben!

552
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,600
St. Barnabas commands you!

553
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,394
- Ben?
- Just keep hold of her!

554
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,649
Ben, I can't hold her!

555
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,358
- Oh, my God! Where is she?
- David! David!

556
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,026
I can't see!
I need light! I need light.

557
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,033
Do something!

558
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,165
Get her back on the bed! Ben!

559
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,664
- Get her legs.
- Michael, get away.

560
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:43,211
I'll carve out your diseased heart
and eat it!

561
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:47,805
I have a whole army of angels
and the Lord Almighty by my side!

562
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,053
You want pain? I'll give you pain!

563
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,559
St. Barnabas commands you!

564
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,649
From whose sight you are not hidden!

565
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:00,693
- St. Barnabas commands you!

566
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,233
St. Barnabas commands you!

567
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,066
You foul, treacherous beast!

568
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:10,074
Give way to Christ,
in whom you found none of your works!

569
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,906
Bow down before God!

570
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,126
Okay, bring her back on her legs.

571
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:26,590
She's stabilizing.

572
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,180
She's stabilizing.

573
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,767
Turn that off. Yeah.

574
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,538
I don't know what to say.

575
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,216
Right there, right there,
you see how her pupil is normal again?

576
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,463
That indicates that she's clean.

577
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,510
Now that you have this,
now you can tell the Church, right,

578
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,050
- that you saved her?
- No.

579
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,803
Yeah, it worked. But that
doesn't mean the Church will support it.

580
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,222
That doesn't make any sense. Why not?

581
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:16,811
Because...

582
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,061
Because the Church would have us
arrested and deported.

583
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,313
What we're doing in the eyes of
the Church is very wrong.

584
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,235
That's why we know it's so right.

585
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,943
Look, her appearance
is completely normal,

586
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,278
and so quickly after the exorcism.

587
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,331
Hello? This is she. Excuse me.

588
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,332
R-O-S-S-I.

589
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,996
- What's that?
- I don't know.

590
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,497
I'm her daughter.
I just got here from America.

591
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:48,922
I think that's a big mistake. We could
go back to the charts, you'll see that...

592
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,344
This is amazing.

593
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:51,846
Thank you.

594
00:43:55,675 --> 00:44:00,522
That was the Diocese of Rome.
I asked for a reevaluation of my mother.

595
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:01,764
What did they say?

596
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,687
They thanked me for my concerns

597
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:08,442
and said that any interference would
probably jeopardize her well-being.

598
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:12,776
Oh! And that God would be watching us
over these trying times.

599
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,368
Are you all right?

600
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:17,872
Fine.

601
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:21,375
I can't believe
the Church turned her down.

602
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,119
Of course
they're gonna turn it down.

603
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,543
...go straight to Dr. Costa
with my own doctor, like David.

604
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,087
The hospital
is outside Vatican City walls,

605
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,215
and I think that means
it's out of their jurisdiction.

606
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,712
What are you two talking about?

607
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:33,796
What's that?

608
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,132
What are you talking about?

609
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,143
- Okay. Okay.
- We need to talk.

610
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,641
- David? Do you have a sec? Okay.
- Yeah.

611
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,348
We don't know what's wrong
with Isabella's mother.

612
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:47,606
Nobody does because she hasn't been
evaluated in over 15 years.

613
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,812
She deserves a second opinion.

614
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,188
A second opinion?

615
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,990
It would give us enough time
to determine her condition.

616
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,409
No, you want to give an exorcism
to Isabella's mother.

617
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,576
That's not what we're saying.

618
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,201
We just need time and we need to know
that she's actually possessed.

619
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,078
Yeah, then she can get
the proper attention.

620
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,704
Look, okay, that's not how this works.

621
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,831
You're here to document,
you're not here to get involved.

622
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,458
- First of all, it's illegal.
- No, it's not illegal.

623
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,581
Yes, Ben, it is!
And in the eyes of the Church...

624
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,041
You know, forget about the Church,
David!

625
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,751
Why does it always come down to that?

626
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,713
What if this works?
What if we find out that it's not D.I.D.?

627
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,343
Yeah, think about it, David.
This could work.

628
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,674
Michael, I know what you're doing.

629
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,055
I know it would be provocative
for your film, but we will be arrested.

630
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,561
How would it even work?

631
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,109
As soon as they found out what we
were doing, they'd shut us down.

632
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,854
The staff won't be allowed with us
in the room.

633
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:35,113
Yeah, we should have that right
to privacy on her behalf, right?

634
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,444
Yeah, you're right.

635
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,871
David, just...

636
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,796
What if it was your own mother?

637
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:56,387
I'm really nervous.

638
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:00,016
I'm an active priest
in good standing with the Holy See.

639
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:03,595
And regardless of the outcome,
the Church will find out,

640
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,601
and it will put my job in jeopardy.

641
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:06,847
Father Ben Rawlings.

642
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,015
<i>But at the same time,</i>

643
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,601
there are problems
within this institution.

644
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,027
There are things that I don't agree with.

645
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,195
<i>In the case of Maria Rossi,</i>

646
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:16,070
<i>I think we should take the time
to actively deduce whether or not</i>

647
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,651
she's being tormented
by an evil presence.

648
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,246
I think.

649
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:26,163
<i>What's the Church's stance
on Maria Rossi?</i>

650
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,748
Well, she's faded into the system.

651
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,751
She's pumped full of drugs
and forgotten.

652
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:36,211
If she becomes too difficult,
there's a panic button on the wall.

653
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,220
- Yeah?
- Yes, I saw that. Thank you.

654
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:42,429
The bottom line here is that something
horrible happened back in 1989.

655
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,390
And it wasn't Maria Rossi's fault.

656
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:48,268
You'll be screening her using SCID-D?
Two hours?

657
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,770
More or less two hours, yeah.
I'd say so.

658
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,069
I feel the Church needs to change.

659
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:58,442
<i>We're so eager to just brush things
under the carpet as if they don't exist.</i>

660
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,653
<i>I don't fit in this Church,
in this guise of the Church.</i>

661
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,155
And I have to do what I believe.

662
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,660
<i>I'll see you soon, Maria.</i>

663
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,787
<i>I know it's dangerous,
and it might not even work.</i>

664
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:15,292
But I can't just sit back and do nothing.

665
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,679
Okay, not a problem.

666
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:34,151
The time is 8:32 a.m.
on Monday, December 7, 2009.

667
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,446
Subject is Maria Rossi. Session one.

668
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,859
Subject appears docile.

669
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,951
Heavily medicated.

670
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:49,826
Pupils are mildly dilated
due to the medication.

671
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,328
Okay. Let's wake her up.

672
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,545
When she wakes up,
we'll see if she gets a reaction.

673
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,798
Counteracting medication.

674
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:04,048
Medication should take effect
in 20 seconds.

675
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,845
So this is
when you provoke her?

676
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,142
Exactly.

677
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,725
Ten seconds.

678
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:16,151
Five, four, three,

679
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,404
two, time.

680
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,195
Maria?

681
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,579
Maria, do you know what this is?

682
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,753
Maria, is there someone
in there with you?

683
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,251
I don't know.

684
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,920
Yes, you do, Maria.

685
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,843
Who's in there?

686
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,588
We can help you.
We can free you from it.

687
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,514
EKG is normal.

688
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,097
They'll be angry.

689
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,185
There's more than one?

690
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,189
Maybe she's clean.

691
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,568
What was that?

692
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,244
Yeah, we got something.

693
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,703
Her pupil's still normal.

694
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,295
It's nothing.

695
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,259
Is she all right?

696
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:23,928
Yeah, she...

697
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,095
She's sleeping.

698
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:32,057
That's the first time
I've seen a possessed person

699
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,148
fall asleep when confronted by
a priest and holy water.

700
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,067
What does that mean?

701
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,737
I don't know. I think...

702
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:44,986
I think we might be wasting our time.

703
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:48,239
I came here for her and I'm
going to do everything I can to help her.

704
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,914
This isn't consistent with any form
of possession that I've ever seen.

705
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,457
I'm sorry, Isabella. This...

706
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,715
Her pupils are
almost fully dilated!

707
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,758
Lord, have mercy! Christ, have mercy!

708
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,427
- What are you doing?
- We're helping her, David!

709
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:06,629
We need to help her!

710
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,931
- Ben, this is not the time or the place!
- Stay back.

711
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,174
I need you to calm down.

712
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,306
- Christ, have mercy.
- Christ, have mercy.

713
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,015
- Christ, hear us.
- Christ, please hear us.

714
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,309
- God, the Father in Heaven.

715
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,355
I know you! I know you, little girl!

716
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,686
- God, the Father in Heaven.

717
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:22,861
God, the Father in Heaven,
most merciful.

718
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,530
God, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ,

719
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:25,948
I appeal to Your Holy Name

720
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,409
against this unclean spirit!
- I know you!

721
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:38,836
Shove that needle in your fucking eye,
you faggot!

722
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,129
I adjure you, ancient serpent

723
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,964
by the judge of the living
and of the dead.

724
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,886
- Don't get too close.
- By your Creator...

725
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,218
- Ben? Ben?
- Michael!

726
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,974
The faith of the holy apostles
and of all the saints commands you,

727
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,976
- reveal yourself before the Creator!
- Watch it!

728
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:00,645
David!

729
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,819
The devout prayers of holy men...

730
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,146
God the Father commands you!

731
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,487
Oh, you can't get back
in your God's good graces, priest.

732
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,195
Not after what you did.

733
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,164
- Ben, what are you doing?
- Her vitals are going crazy.

734
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,378
Get back. Get back.

735
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,717
Michael, put the camera down
and help!

736
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,003
I want to help her!

737
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,963
Get her leg! Get her leg!

738
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:34,842
Careful. Grab her leg!

739
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,015
I got her. Get her arm.

740
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,727
Isabella, is it locked?

741
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,234
- Close the bolt!
- Yes! Yes!

742
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,026
Tell me your name, coward!

743
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,231
Asbeel!

744
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:55,117
Come that close to me one more time
and I'll use your tongue

745
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:59,792
to skull fuck the baby killer over there!

746
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:06,044
<i>The itsy bitsy spider
came down the water spout</i>

747
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:12,422
<i>Down came the rain
and washed the spider out</i>

748
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,257
<i>Out came the sun...</i>

749
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,344
Isabella, don't listen to it.
It's not your mother.

750
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,728
- Come on, baby.
- Isabella, it's not your mother!

751
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,225
You know the words.

752
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,103
Isabella, snap out of it!

753
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,976
- Do it!
- Demons!

754
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:31,566
You are guilty
before our Lord Jesus Christ

755
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:34,072
whom you dared to nail upon the cross.

756
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:37,450
Pulse is 284. Rhythm is way off.

757
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,749
I'm not like the others, demon!

758
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,251
Do you hear me, transgressor?

759
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,956
- I hear you, priest.
- Seducer!

760
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,213
All you fucking do is talk!

761
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,548
The holy apostles Peter and Paul
and all the saints command you.

762
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:55,632
Give way to Christ,
in whom you found none of your works!

763
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,968
For it is not He who condemns you,

764
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,975
but rather He
who rules the living and the dead.

765
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,310
Our Father, who art in heaven...

766
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:08,273
- No, it's gonna kill her!
- Just stay there, Isabella.

767
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:11,939
No, no, no.

768
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,034
For thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory,

769
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,865
for ever and ever. Amen.

770
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:21,032
Let my mother go.

771
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,294
You'll burn.

772
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:28,831
You'll burn eternal.

773
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,467
Poor child.

774
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,602
- Please, open this door now!

775
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,225
Pulse is dropping.

776
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,016
Maria? Maria, can you hear us?

777
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,059
Starting to regain
consciousness.

778
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,987
Temp is returning to normal.

779
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,485
Over.

780
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,458
<i>- Tell me your name, coward!</i>
<i>- Asbeel!</i>

781
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,045
I'll be feeling that tomorrow.

782
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,125
See, this is preternatural movement
right here.

783
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,880
I've seen it before,
but I've never captured it on tape.

784
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,670
So, what does that mean?

785
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:19,678
It means we've got
everything that we need right here.

786
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,850
This is huge, Isabella.

787
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,511
Let's play it again.

788
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,393
Do you realize how big this is?

789
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,648
With the evidence we've got,

790
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,692
the Holy See has to see us.
They have to.

791
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,520
We can go to the press with this

792
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,573
and in an instant, we'd have
1,000 people standing out there.

793
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:39,030
Our priority right now
should be getting her back to the States.

794
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,528
The endorsement of Dr. Costa is vital.

795
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:45,082
But after the results that he saw,
there's no way that he can't agree.

796
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,834
Dr. Costa doesn't believe
that she was possessed or anything.

797
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:51,084
He thinks it was an exercise
that shocked her system.

798
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,506
Anyway, it doesn't matter
what he believes

799
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:56,381
because his referral's actually gonna
help us get her back to the States.

800
00:54:56,543 --> 00:55:01,219
<i>Oh, you can't get back
in your God's good graces, priest.</i>

801
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,724
What are you doing?

802
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,266
I'm just...

803
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:11,187
I'm just analyzing Maria's audio.

804
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:15,897
I'm just trying to work out if there is
more than one voice inside her.

805
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,240
See, there can...

806
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:24,739
See? See? Right there. You hear that?

807
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,418
- She's speaking in tongues, right?
- No, no.

808
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:35,417
It's one sentence, spoken in
more than one language, I think.

809
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,626
I'm just trying to isolate how many.

810
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:47,303
<i>You wanted him to die,
didn't you?</i>

811
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:48,979
Ben, what is she talking about?

812
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:51,440
<i>You wanted him to die, didn't you?</i>

813
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,651
Is she talking about your uncle?

814
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,861
I found four voices on the recording.
I found four voices on the recording.

815
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,072
- You found four?
- Wait, what does that mean?

816
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:09,784
It means that the entity
in your mother had disciples.

817
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,710
We call it multiple demonic possession.

818
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,880
You might have heard
Gallo talking about it in class.

819
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,299
Wait, so it's a powerful demon.

820
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,626
Yeah. It's a beast.

821
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,132
- What?
- You know how lucky we are?

822
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:29,265
Look, we're gonna deliver all our
findings to the Holy See next Friday.

823
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,721
Yeah, maybe.
He hasn't agreed to see us.

824
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,023
Yeah, well, have you told him that
the press might be interested?

825
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,566
That's not very diplomatic.

826
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,689
Can't we just wait a little bit
till my mother's case is resolved?

827
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:37,894
I mean, the press?

828
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,606
Hang on a minute. Just because
you've got what you want now,

829
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:43,613
you're expecting us just to keep quiet?
Michael, please, just get...

830
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,410
Stop! Stop! That's not what I meant!

831
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,738
Because there are lot more
people to help

832
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,289
rather than just your mother, okay?

833
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,914
- Wait, did Father Gallo call you?
- What's your problem?

834
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,336
No. You?

835
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,163
Yeah, he called me twice.

836
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,504
What did he say?

837
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,962
He wants to help us
make the right decision.

838
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,468
He's worried about us.
Especially, he's worried about me.

839
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,891
- You? Why?
- Because of my job, Ben.

840
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,682
David, what are you doing
with the papers? Are you okay?

841
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:14,640
I'm fine. The conversation's just
giving me a little bit of a headache.

842
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:17,021
David, he's just trying to scare you.
That's all.

843
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,101
- Is that blood?
- He's a moral man.

844
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,028
And he's toeing the company line
on this one and you know it.

845
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,776
Is your nose bleeding?

846
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,738
David, you got something.
Are you okay?

847
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,407
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry. I'm fine.

848
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:35,915
Look.

849
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,750
I'm sorry.

850
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,124
It's probably stress.

851
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,882
- It's a lot of work to do for Friday.
- Yeah.

852
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,008
Are you all right?

853
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:58,525
- They won't release her.
- What?

854
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,895
- Why not?
- I don't know. They won't say.

855
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,988
They can't or won't believe
that she's better.

856
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,492
- Where are my keys?
- I don't...

857
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,375
Where are my fucking keys?
They were right here.

858
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,623
- I don't know. Relax.
- Where are my fucking keys, Michael?

859
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,794
I don't know.
It feels like they'll never release her.

860
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,179
There's no way
the Church can't see this.

861
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:30,804
I can look them in the eye and tell them
that it was the right thing to do.

862
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,154
This is what they do.
They cover things up, they ignore it,

863
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,360
no matter who it hurts or destroys.

864
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,538
Well, not this time.
Not this fucking time.

865
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,707
This was supposed to be
about my mother. Not anybody else.

866
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:59,036
Not about Ben's ego, or David's job.

867
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,966
I have a sinking feeling I'm going to be
excommunicated for all this. I think.

868
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,253
- For what we did.
- David's inner coward

869
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,427
is really coming out.

870
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,756
Ben and David, maybe I get them.

871
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:14,635
They have their own thing going on,
but Isabella,

872
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,303
we started this together.

873
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,014
Michael just has to stop.

874
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,857
- He just wants to...

875
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:24,190
They have this group of three

876
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:27,614
and I'm like
the annoying guy with the camera.

877
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:39,539
David, what the fuck are you doing?

878
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,500
If it weren't for me

879
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,295
no one would know anything
about what the hell they're doing

880
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:48,923
in their Church and in their basements.

881
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:53,178
Look, I really think
we need to talk about some stuff.

882
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,282
- What's wrong with the camera?
- I don't know. Just...

883
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:15,612
What's wrong?

884
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,993
- Not then. Before she hit you.
- Michael, did you see anything?

885
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,199
No, I didn't see anything.

886
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,872
- Okay, we'll just try another...
- This is something else.

887
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,454
Yeah, but it's at the exact same time.

888
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:27,713
It must have been just a power surge
through the hospital.

889
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,008
It's the only thing I can think of.

890
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,303
For all the cameras?
It could be something else.

891
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:33,472
- Hey, we're filming.
- I'm sorry.

892
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,390
- David, you have to see this.
- I have to go.

893
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,977
- I said we're filming.
- I know. I heard you. I got to go.

894
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,391
What's the matter?

895
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,599
- The bishop denied our request.
- What?

896
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:48,480
It's just a bloody meeting.
What was the reason?

897
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,569
The incident's under investigation.

898
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,943
- Well, of course it is.
- David...

899
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:56,032
- David.
- Yeah?

900
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,451
- It's going to be okay. All right?
- I hope so.

901
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,537
- I hope so.
- David, wait, wait.

902
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,664
I'm coming with you, remember?
The baptism?

903
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,120
Come on. Let's go.

904
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,878
- Michael, how long is this going to take?
- Just a second.

905
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:11,130
- Do we really need this?
- Yep.

906
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,763
- Are you okay with that, David?
- I'm fine. You ready?

907
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,425
<i>Baptism, baptism.</i>

908
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,600
Baptism is the transferal of sins,

909
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,603
<i>both original and personal.</i>

910
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,609
<i>Now, for example,</i>

911
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:31,697
<i>if a baby were to die
after being baptized</i>

912
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,440
it would go to Heaven.

913
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,114
And if before

914
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,948
it would go to Hell.

915
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:44,619
<i>In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

916
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,169
Amen.

917
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,339
Brethren, our fair Father Christ
in His great loving kindness

918
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,588
hath ordained that His mystic bride,
the Holy Mother of the Church,

919
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:56,054
to protect her children at every stage
from the cradle to the grave.

920
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:59,300
And to this end is the Sacrament
of Holy Baptism ordained.

921
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,892
Amen.

922
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,567
John Thomas,
in the name of Christ our Lord

923
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,733
I anoint thee with oil for thy safekeeping.

924
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,755
John Thomas,

925
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,924
I baptize you

926
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:40,258
in the name of the Father,
and of the Son

927
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,764
and of the Holy Spirit.

928
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,982
David? What's he doing?

929
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,481
David!

930
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:53,987
- Father, stop.
- Please stop!

931
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,822
What are you doing, David?

932
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,316
David, stop, stop!

933
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,161
David! For God's sake!

934
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,033
Somebody, stop him!

935
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,079
You know what I'd like to do?

936
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:15,167
I'd like to take this fucking camera,

937
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:19,262
turn it around
and stick it in Michael's face.

938
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,851
I'd like to ask him,
"What was it like, Michael?"

939
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:28,855
"What was it like when"

940
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:33,193
"your mom fucked
your father's best friend?"

941
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,531
David?

942
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,746
Hey, David!

943
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:55,465
Michael, what's wrong with David?
What's happened?

944
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:01,380
What's going on?

945
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:10,226
The...

946
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,895
The kid almost died.

947
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,396
What?

948
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,854
What happened? What did you say?

949
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:22,409
The baby he was baptizing,
he almost drowned it.

950
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:27,073
- What are you doing?
- Setting up the camera.

951
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,999
- No, wait. Just leave the camera.
- Is the baby okay?

952
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,747
Yeah, I think so.

953
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:34,087
You think so? Did you see it?
Were you there or not?

954
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,755
Do I think the baby's okay?
Yeah.

955
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,503
Is he in trouble?

956
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:40,297
I don't know.
They called the police and he just left.

957
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,675
- David!
- Okay, just come back when you...

958
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:47,760
Well, he's been acting strange all day.
Did you see it happen?

959
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:52,598
See it? I filmed it! It
was like he lost it!

960
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:57,440
He's been under a lot of stress lately,
so maybe that contributed to...

961
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,362
I don't know.
You should have been there.

962
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,439
It was like he was crazy!

963
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,237
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

964
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,283
No, of course not!

965
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,449
- David!
- David?

966
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:08,576
What the hell's going on?

967
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,373
Michael, get the camera.
We need the light.

968
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,831
- Ben?
- David?

969
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,628
David?

970
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,629
What's he doing up there?

971
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,314
Watch. Careful.

972
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:48,532
- What the hell is all this?
- I don't know.

973
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,909
Ben, are those Bible pages?

974
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,454
- Oh, Jesus.
- David!

975
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,872
Come here. What have you done?

976
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,453
Oh, my God, Ben.
He's bleeding all over.

977
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,959
Get his arms up.
Put them up. Put them up.

978
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:01,417
- No, no, no.
- What is it?

979
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:03,714
No, no, no.

980
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:09,307
- What do we do, Ben?
- I don't know!

981
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,804
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

982
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,261
I don't know what to do!

983
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:14,804
Where's...

984
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,526
Go, go, go! Get out! Stay out!

985
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,774
Stay downstairs!
Don't come back upstairs again!

986
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:26,946
Just stay down there!

987
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:28,823
- Okay, okay.
- Look at me. Look in my eyes.

988
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:31,030
Michael, did you see his eyes?
Did you see his eyes?

989
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,614
- Shit!

990
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:33,789
<i>Polizia! Polizia!</i>

991
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:34,832
No, no.

992
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:38,545
Father Keane?
Where is Father David Keane?

993
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,580
- He's upstairs.
- He's very, very sick.

994
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,003
- Turn on the lights.
- I can't.

995
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,925
This is the only light we have.

996
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,170
- Are you David Keane?
- No, no.

997
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,549
He's upstairs, he's upstairs,
but it's not safe to go up there!

998
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:52,009
Stay down here, please!

999
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,764
Holy shit.

1000
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,271
Do you need the light?

1001
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,231
David!

1002
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,745
- He took your gun?
- Yes, he took my gun!

1003
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:20,828
We need to get out right now.

1004
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:22,789
All of us need to get out. We need to...

1005
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,549
David? David?

1006
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,334
David?

1007
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:28,295
He's my friend!

1008
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:33,471
David? David, listen to me.
Put down the gun.

1009
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:37,387
- Just put down the gun, yeah?
- David...

1010
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:40,815
Listen to me. It's Ben, okay?
It's your friend.

1011
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:43,855
- No, no!
- Be quiet, Isabella.

1012
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:46,905
David, listen to me, all right?

1013
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:50,530
This isn't you.
Just listen to my voice, okay?

1014
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,152
This is your friend, Ben.

1015
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,822
This isn't you.

1016
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:58,408
Something else
has taken control of you.

1017
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,914
You know this. You know this.

1018
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,542
Okay?

1019
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:07,296
Focus on my voice.
You need to trust me, David. Okay?

1020
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,628
Just stay calm.

1021
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:14,637
I can't stop.
I can't stop it, Ben!

1022
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:18,352
You can, you can fight it.
Just fight it! Fight it, David.

1023
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:22,019
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

1024
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,021
hallowed be Thy name.

1025
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:28,025
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth...

1026
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:36,487
I forgot it.

1027
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:39,040
- Just give me the gun.
- I forgot it.

1028
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,992
He says to say, "Thank you".

1029
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,538
Jesus!

1030
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,506
The light!

1031
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,633
Come here, come here. Oh, shit.

1032
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:58,009
Fuck!

1033
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,560
I need an ambulance now!

1034
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,398
What's wrong with her?

1035
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,522
She's having a seizure. Come here.

1036
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,064
You saw his eyes, right?

1037
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:15,239
- Ben!
- I saw his eyes!

1038
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:16,695
- Tell me what's happening, Ben!
- I don't want to...

1039
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:17,995
I got to know what's happening, Ben!

1040
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,997
Maybe there's some

1041
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,329
transference.

1042
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,077
Demonic transference?

1043
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,255
Of course I mean demonic transference,
Michael!

1044
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:28,840
- Transference like?
- Just fucking...

1045
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,714
- Michael, please just shut the fuck up!
- Don't you fucking yell at me, Ben!

1046
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,591
Of course I'm gonna fucking yell at you!

1047
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,513
You've been here
the whole fucking time!

1048
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:37,428
Have you not listened to me?

1049
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,388
Jesus.

1050
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:46,107
No, no! Please, wait here.
Wait out there! Yes, please.

1051
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,417
Her name is Isabella Rossi.

1052
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:14,923
Can we see her yet?

1053
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:44,866
I believe there's transference.

1054
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:50,172
- I don't know. Not for certain.
- Who are you talking to?

1055
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:56,052
More than one. Four, possibly.

1056
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:03,469
Okay, okay. I'll bring her to you
as soon as I can, Father Gallo.

1057
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:04,893
Thank you.

1058
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:10,483
Yeah, I know. It's David's fault.

1059
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:15,401
The doctor asked me to talk to you, yes.
She's doing much better, your friend.

1060
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,858
She's stable and she's resting,
so I suggest you go.

1061
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,317
When can we see her?

1062
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:21,945
She's gonna be here overnight,
so you can see her tomorrow.

1063
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,245
Overnight? That's not possible.

1064
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:24,664
Why is that?

1065
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,913
There's something wrong with her.
It's not safe here.

1066
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:29,995
No, this is very safe, I assure you.

1067
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,124
Something's wrong with her.

1068
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:32,751
We need to get her
out of here right now.

1069
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,922
No, gentlemen, we are extremely...

1070
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:37,172
Do you know
who Father Robert Gallo is?

1071
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:39,925
Father Gallo, yes, I know him,
but I don't understand...

1072
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,261
Isabella?

1073
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:45,976
Isabella?

1074
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,274
What do we do, Ben?

1075
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,691
Isabella, listen to me!

1076
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:06,827
We need to get her out of here now!

1077
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:18,710
Michael!

1078
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:22,218
I've got her now!

1079
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,053
We need to get her under control!

1080
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:29,350
Help me, please!

1081
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:33,732
I know this woman.
She needs to be sedated. Do it, now!

1082
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:38,564
Jesus will bring your plans to nothing.
Christ will have none of your plans.

1083
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,240
Let's take this outside.

1084
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,073
Michael, put the camera down!

1085
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:52,334
Listen to me. I'm a priest.
Please, go and help those people.

1086
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,583
- Keep her here.
- Thank you, Father.

1087
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:58,420
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1088
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:02,879
- Come on.
- She just killed that woman.

1089
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:04,972
We need to end this.

1090
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:09,348
Grab her legs. Help me grab her legs!
We're going to Father Gallo's.

1091
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:10,766
What's he going to do?

1092
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:13,522
I need help with the exorcism.

1093
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,442
Get the door. Get the door.

1094
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,023
Oh, my God. What have I done?

1095
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:19,778
You really think Gallo's going to help?

1096
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,443
Yeah, I need help.

1097
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,196
- I need to fix this.

1098
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:26,198
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. She's waking up.

1099
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,029
She's waking up.

1100
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:31,287
We haven't got much time, Michael.
We haven't got much time.

1101
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:33,710
Stay with me. Don't let it get to you.

1102
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:38,456
When I was 13,
my uncle told me he was an exorcist.

1103
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:42,006
You can't get back
into God's good graces, priest.

1104
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,711
Not after what you did.

1105
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,467
Ben?

1106
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:47,511
You wanted him to die,
didn't you?

1107
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,179
What is she doing?

1108
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:51,806
He says to say, "Thank you."

1109
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:53,805
Who are you?

1110
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:57,309
You know me. Everyone knows me.

1111
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:00,065
- Lord, have mercy! Christ, have mercy!

1112
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,270
Jesus.

1113
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:02,480
God the Father!

1114
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,399
Oh, my God!

1115
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:07,818
Oh, shit!

1116
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,032
Your place is in solitude!

1117
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:15,159
Your abode is in the nest of serpents!

1118
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,370
Be gone forthwith
from this servant of God!

1119
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:20,214
Get out of her! Get out of her!

1120
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:29,390
It's working, right?

1121
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:31,634
I have got her under control,
but I don't know for how long.

1122
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,060
You've got to hurry up.

1123
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:38,933
It's okay.

1124
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,479
It's going to be okay. I'm sorry.

1125
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,281
Just be strong.

1126
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,199
- Be strong.

1127
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:49,990
Just be strong.

1128
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:52,204
Michael!
