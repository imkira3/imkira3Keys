1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,574
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:53,042
What's the matter? You're quiet.

3
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:57,483
Can't we decline this assignment?

4
00:00:58,526 --> 00:00:59,550
Why?

5
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:04,795
He's a serial killer. He won't hesitate to kill.

6
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:08,762
He is the one, who planned this strike.

7
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,034
That's a guarantee of safety.

8
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:18,436
And l'm sure he knows about us, too.

9
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:21,012
Huh? About what?

10
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:23,413
l'm going, Raye.

11
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,644
Hey, Naomi.

12
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:29,880
l'll be all right, Raye.

13
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,561
Do you know ''takami no kenbutsu''?

14
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,996
''Takami no kenbutsu.''

15
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,807
Watch an event unfold as a spectator.

16
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,308
My intention is to fight along with them.

17
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:34,113
Following the B.B. case,

18
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,448
this is the 2nd time you're assigning Naomi.

19
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:40,088
You must really trust Naomi.

20
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:43,463
She plans to quit the F.B.l. to get married.

21
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:46,862
At such a time,
she can prove to be most effective.

22
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,067
Just like this.

23
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:56,141
Do you think of quitting, too?

24
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:58,742
Me? Quit?

25
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:04,582
For me...this is everything.

26
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:12,616
Watari, l'll be happy as long as you're with me.

27
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:21,501
lsn't Miss Naomi in danger?

28
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:31,540
12 sec. earlier than l planned. She's very good.

29
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:35,215
You're very good, too.

30
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,212
Thank you very much.

31
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,822
Make arrangements to go to Japan.

32
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:46,585
To Japan?

33
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:54,125
With 97% probability,

34
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:57,998
Kira is in Japan.

35
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:10,775
l may not be able to come back here.

36
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,901
''The person whose name
is written in the notebook... will die.''

37
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,931
''Time of death, controlled by Death Note,
is 23 days.''

38
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,333

00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:53,781
You, over there.

41
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:54,955
Yes, Sir!

42
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:00,416
Take care of that.

43
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:18,770
We're finished here.

44
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,352
BOY!

45
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:43,991
We've got to get out of here!
This village is over.

46
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:46,759
Come on. Let's go.

47
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,027
This mission is accomplished.

48
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,639
Look, sir! They're here!

49
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:58,100
Wrap it up.

50
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,013
Come on! Move out!

51
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,937
Sir! There is a truck moving north.

52
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,984
We don't need any witnesses or survivors.

53
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,520
Yes, Sir!

54
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:26,727
We're being followed.

55
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,227
Drop you off.

56
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:36,536
Find a phone and call 0105928147218.

57
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:41,604
Shit! You need to write it down, don't you.

58
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:47,149
0105928147218

59
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,649
Well done. Listen!

60
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:56,496
Call that number, and say F1225, OK?

61
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:01,424
This is very important.
You must call that number.

62
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,635
Watari will protect you.

63
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:18,841
Good luck! BOY!

64
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,667

00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:41,385
''F dead. Biomonitor's not responding''

66
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:46,229
Bad news?

67
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,533
F died in Thailand.

68
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:55,637
lt was in the line of duty,
so it couldn't be helped but...

69
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,547
That's Misa's notebook, isn't it?

70
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:33,176
Whose name did you write in? Light Yagami's?

71
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,905
This is the last name to be written...

72
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,113
in the Death Note.

73
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,548
''L. Lawliet - Will quietly die...

75
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:47,084
L...

76
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:52,789
Light Yagami will attempt to kill me
with the Death Note.

77
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:57,570
Determine my own fate.

78
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,698
lt's the one and only way to outwit Death.

79
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:08,939
To stop the enormous evil called Kira,

80
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,518
it's a small sacrifice.

81
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:19,224
So, it's 23 days later.

82
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:23,919
Bring Misa Amane here.
Kira and l have a score to settle.

00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,691
Do you check your temperature?

86
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:58,321
Of course. Every 4 hours.

87
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,030
You told me to, dad.

88

00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:22,850
l want to take you somewhere
on your next day off.

92
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:26,958

Thanks. Good work.

Dr. Kujo.

00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,806
Virus weapon sent from Thailand.

102
00:17:58,312 --> 00:17:59,802
Virus weapon...

103
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,308
Washington wants us to examine this.

104
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:07,418
l examined it,
and discovered 2 types of virus are its roots.

105
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:13,922
Highly infectious influenza virus

106
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:17,790
was crossed with the deadly Ebola genes.

107
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:20,859
lt is Death itself.

108
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:24,331
lnfection rate is 100 times that of Ebola.

109
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:42,848
Who in the world made this?

110
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:48,851
Many countries are secretly undertaking
the development of virus weapons.

111
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,223
Some countries succeeded.

112
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:54,423
No, this one is a failure.

113
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:55,533
What?

114
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:59,172
Virus weapon is a success,
only if it comes with an antidote.

115
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:02,809
Otherwise, the user will also be infected.

116
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:08,744
l'm sure there was antidote,
but it's of no use now.

117
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:11,273
What do you mean?

118
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:16,417
This virus has mutated in the past 20 hours.

119
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:30,066
Mr. Watari, are you Mr. Ryuzaki's father?

120
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,830
No, l'm...

Burning that won't change your lifespan.

C'mon...Wait.

127
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:02,859
Light said he could be
the god of a new world with that.

128
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:05,156
Doesn't that interest you?

129
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,269
The way Light died...

130
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,278

Sorry l kept you waiting, Prof. Kagami.

135
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,943
Though we act like the ruler of Earth,

136
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:12,610
mankind cannot even imitate the basics of nature.

137
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:20,023
10 years ago,
the planet's self-recuperative power

138
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:21,818
would have been effective.

139
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:26,155
But now it is no longer...

140
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:31,433
Yes, Earth is coming to its end.

141
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:39,209
All the more,
l looked forward to cleansing Earth, that is...

142
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,771
by reducing humans with the virus.

143
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:45,913
l'm aware of that.

144
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,552
lf you are, Matoba,

145
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:59,355
why seek a buyer for that virus?

146
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,028
Pardon?

147
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:06,261
Union of European companies,
the American establishment,

148
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:07,963
and Russia.

149
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,468
You're weighing their bids.

150
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,116
ls it money you want?

151
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,916
Such greed for personal gain...

152
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:26,622
has contaminated the wealth of Earth's nature.

153
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,094
Don't you understand that?

154
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:39,302
Get out of here.

155
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,476
There is no place here for the likes of you.

156
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:18,777
There's no place for you here.

157
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:21,445
Prof. Kagami.

158
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:28,118
Are you really trying to sell the virus?

159
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:31,290
You heard the originator of this plan.

160
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:36,089
The virus must be scattered
simultaneously in various areas.

161
00:26:37,197 --> 00:26:38,789
To enable that...

162
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:44,467
we need to become partners with a group
which has a global network.

163
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:51,709
We don't need any people hesitant
of our Earth Cleansing Plan.

164
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,271
Are we clear on this?

165
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:15,830
We're all gonna die anyway.

See the man the camera captured.

168
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:49,526
He's the serial killer, murdering the clergymen.

169
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,326
This man?

170
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,363
Yes.

171
00:27:55,275 --> 00:27:58,005
The probability rate is 86%.

172
00:27:58,211 --> 00:28:02,614
lf he's the culprit,
he hides souvenirs in the crypt under the church.

173
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:03,907
Yes, sir.

174
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:10,953
Concerning Princess Joanne's death...

175
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:15,785
l have evidence that it was not accident
but assassination.

176
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:19,258

177
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,692

The leader of the arms syndicate, Rod Ross.

179
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:42,546
He deals with the mafia
at the Far East underground market once a month.

180
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:45,254
Most of the arms go to the Middle East.

181
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:48,791
Fifty AK47s. When is the next trade?

182
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:50,326
Next Saturday.

00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,833
Phone call from Chaiang Mai. lt's for Watari.

186
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,204
l, L will take that call.

187
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:21,386
F1225... F1225...

188
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:23,714
A gift from F.

189
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:32,122
l'll accept the gift.

12 DAYS LEFT

191
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:59,614
Although he's scared, he's physically sound.

192
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:02,379
Why was he the only one not infected?

193
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:05,283
l don't know.

194
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,888
Unless we find a countermeasure,
the virus will be used again.

195
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:14,395
And in the near future.

This Room...

is only for Watari and l.

200
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,703
May l take a look?

201
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:27,499
My first babysitting experience...

202
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,604
doesn't seem to work out.

203
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,630
Maki, welcome home. Did you have a good day?

204
00:36:32,158 --> 00:36:34,217
Mom.

205
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:39,329
Maki.

206
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:46,363
l need a favor.

207
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:48,240
What?

208
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:52,534
Please deliver this to him.

209
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,542
The address is in here.

210
00:37:00,753 --> 00:37:02,584
Him? Who is it?

211
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,888
He's the answer to this.

212
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,698
Homework was well done.

213
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,925
Naturally.

214
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:24,467
And...This is your new homework.

215
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:28,440
Again?

216
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:30,910
l'm well aware.

217
00:37:32,151 --> 00:37:36,554
that ''if it's difficult,
it's worth the challenge.''

218
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:44,763
Now, off with you.

219
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:16,661
Dr. Kujo.

220
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:19,396
Yes?

221
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:23,401
Can you stay? l'd like to talk to you.

222
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,627
Fine with me. What is it?

223
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,335
Meet me in P-4.

224
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,637
Yes, l will.

225
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:41,785
Mr. Matoba, please.

226
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,636
Watari.

227
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:09,672
While l was working undercover
on the bio-terrorism attack in the village.

228
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:12,974
l met a boy who doesn't seem to be affected
by the virus.

229
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:15,810
The virus is devastating this village.

230
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:19,083
lt is extremely dangerous and fatal.

231
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:29,563
l am going to give the boy the contact information
for Wammy's headquarters.

232
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:33,568
The attack is connected
with the global terrorist network.

233
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:38,870
This Japanese man ''Matoba'' is a key person
to this investigation.

234
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:50,012
VlRl AND BACTERlA lNFECTlONS

235
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,665
May l help you?

236
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:52,382
Sorry to bother you at this hour, but we're...

237
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:00,082
such people.

238
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:20,772
Why are you here?

239
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:53,836
Dr. Kujo.

240
00:41:54,046 --> 00:41:55,877
How can l help you?

241
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:03,352
Oh, it's you.

242
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:07,153
Examined the culture fluid of that virus.

243
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:11,053
The ingredients matched those l mixed.

244
00:42:11,263 --> 00:42:15,461
ln other words,
that virus was created in this lab.

245
00:42:17,803 --> 00:42:22,035
What is this? Who are you? Why're you doing this?

246
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:25,775
We are people who grieve the future of Earth.

247
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:29,414
Earth's ecosystem will be destroyed.

248
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:34,512
The human specie has increased excessively.

249
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:40,022
Don't you understand?

250
00:42:41,493 --> 00:42:46,123
lf there are too many,
all we do is decreasing that number.

251
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,135
Virus weapon for that? That is so foolish!

252
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,969
Dr. Kujo, don't tell me you agree with him.

253
00:42:59,178 --> 00:43:01,806
You're intelligent and decent.

254
00:43:02,281 --> 00:43:06,047
l am...the originator of this plan.

255
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:13,952
By the excessive increase of humans,
earth is now at peril.

256
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:18,427
l will eliminate useless human beings

257
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:22,699
to create a new world and its ecosystem.

258
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:25,531
How could you...?

259
00:43:26,171 --> 00:43:32,110
Prof., l didn't intend to tell you so soon.

260
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:36,177
l wanted you to concentrate on developing
the antidote for that virus.

261
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:44,581
What's the matter?

262
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:48,589
l knew it.

263
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:52,629
You've succeeded.

264
00:44:43,382 --> 00:44:45,316
This is the only antidote.

265
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:50,045
l've deleted all the data.

266
00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:59,793
l'm going to incinerate this, too.

267
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:01,056
Professor.

268
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:13,275
Without this, you can't spread the virus.

269
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:15,069
Prof. Nikaido.

270
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:17,174
Hand it over.

271
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:18,007
No.

272
00:45:18,217 --> 00:45:19,809
Prof., don't do it.

273
00:45:32,264 --> 00:45:34,255
Bring the professor's daughter.

274
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:38,966
Why my daughter?

275
00:45:40,005 --> 00:45:43,839
Which is more precious?
Your daughter or antidote data?

276
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:51,742
Go.

277
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:01,581
Wait!

278
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:15,399
l guess there's no alternative.

279
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:11,124
Why that virus?

280
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:23,665
Professor!

281
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:34,376
Dr. Kujo.

282
00:47:36,288 --> 00:47:40,952
You have overcome the weakness
of the virus weapon.

283
00:47:43,762 --> 00:47:47,289
Virus will not onset immediately.

284
00:47:47,566 --> 00:47:52,799
Because of this,
it was said that virus cannot be a weapon.

285
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,831
But you have...

286
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:59,975
The new world needs people like you, professor.

287
00:48:01,446 --> 00:48:04,176
Need?

288
00:48:05,384 --> 00:48:14,053
l do not want to be chosen by people like you.

289
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,628
Have P-4...

290
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:30,739
incinerated in the plasma furnace.

291
00:48:31,143 --> 00:48:33,873
This virus...

292
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,148
eats through the epidemic prevention filter.

293
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:22,445
Thank you!

294
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:35,929
- Hey, what's up?
- Please. Drive.

295
00:50:36,735 --> 00:50:37,702
Where to?

296
00:50:55,554 --> 00:50:58,250
Go to all these addresses.

297
00:51:09,935 --> 00:51:12,961
You said the antidote data is here.

298
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:14,604
Please look for it.

00:52:48,733 --> 00:52:51,531
Maki, welcome home.

310
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:58,103
Clear these.

311
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:04,509
- Mustn't communicate now.
- Get back.

312
00:53:15,794 --> 00:53:18,854
l'm K. How do you do? You're L?

313
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:21,121
Yes, you're right.

315
00:53:29,474 --> 00:53:34,571
Thank you for letting me know about Watari.
You surprised me.

316
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,441
ls anything wrong?

317
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:40,579
l'm working on infectious disease.

318
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:47,981
Something happened, and l need your help.

319
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,893
My help? Why?

320
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,887
A new, devastating virus was discovered.

321
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:58,568
But my partner who developed
the antidote was murdered.

322
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:03,434
The data is missing, and l want you to find it.

323
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:09,312
Mankind must be saved.

324
00:54:10,582 --> 00:54:14,416
l see. You must provide me with the details.

325
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:17,244
Please come over at noon tomorrow?

326
00:54:17,856 --> 00:54:20,484
Yes, l will. Tell me where to go.

327
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,054
l'll send you a map.

328
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:32,666
See you then.

00:55:08,173 --> 00:55:11,404
l'm working on infectious disease.

Who was that?

331
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:38,732
A formidable foe.

332
00:55:40,672 --> 00:55:42,640
Maki took the data with her.

333
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:45,234
The data will come here.

334
00:55:46,277 --> 00:55:50,213
6 DAYS LEFT

335
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,750
Ah...Excuse me.

336
00:55:58,857 --> 00:55:59,915
Can l help you?

337
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:06,226
l was told to show you this.

338
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:09,389
l have no idea what that is.

339
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:14,403
So this isn't it, either. Darn.

340
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:16,863
What's the matter?

341
00:56:18,643 --> 00:56:23,444
l've been driving all night from yesterday.
l've really had it.

342
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:28,277
Only talks to her bear. l give up.

343
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:29,777
Bear?

344
00:56:30,088 --> 00:56:34,457
A teddy bear. The passenger is a girl.

345
00:56:36,828 --> 00:56:39,626
She's looking for a man named Watari.

346
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:41,965
l guess this isn't it, either.

347
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,329
Thank you for your time.

348
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:49,805
Would you please let that girl in?

349
00:56:59,484 --> 00:57:00,815
What is that?

350
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:04,414
Some medicine?

351
00:57:04,956 --> 00:57:07,618
No, this is a virus.

352
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:09,291
A virus?

353
00:57:09,494 --> 00:57:10,461
Yes.

354
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:16,663
At all costs, no one must possess the antidote.

355
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:21,703
One who possesses
it will be invincible to the virus weapon.

356
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:27,469
That's why Prof. Nikaido
entrusted Watari with this virus

357
00:57:27,979 --> 00:57:30,948
and destroyed the only antidote he developed

358
00:57:33,518 --> 00:57:35,315
along with himself.

359
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:12,149
Have a bite.

360
00:58:34,078 --> 00:58:35,238
What time is it?

361
00:58:37,048 --> 00:58:38,345
lt's 8:00.

362
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,804
My dad's orders.

363
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:10,034
lt's unlocked.

364
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:12,538
Good.

365
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:01,982
Maki!

366
01:01:03,528 --> 01:01:06,122
What your dad confided in you...

367
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,321
was the wrong item.

368
01:01:08,533 --> 01:01:11,661
He needs that badly. Can you give it back?

369
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:15,728
So, that's it.

370
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:17,133
K...

371
01:01:19,377 --> 01:01:22,904
Or shall l call you Dr. Kimiko Kujo.

372
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:25,911
The appointed time is noon.

373
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:30,516
You seem to have found out my name.

374
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:34,085
Then, l want you to show your face.

375
01:01:35,626 --> 01:01:40,120
Watari was very proud of you.

376
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:44,899
l'm sure he still feels that way.

377
01:02:20,805 --> 01:02:23,569
Don't think he can save you.

378
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:26,739
He has his weak points, too.

379
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:30,911
Some things can't be solved up here.

380
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:38,487
Let me go.

381
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:40,349
Let me go.

382
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:05,008
Maki.

383
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:11,080
What the hell...

384
01:03:24,602 --> 01:03:26,069
Murderer!

385
01:03:28,172 --> 01:03:29,764
l saw it all.

386
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:37,907
You should bleed and die like my dad.

387
01:03:51,896 --> 01:03:54,763
lndeed, that is my weak point.

388
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:58,893
Let me go. You'll be infected.

389
01:03:59,437 --> 01:04:00,768
Let me go.

390
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,099
Let me go.

391
01:04:06,477 --> 01:04:07,671
Let me go.

392
01:04:24,295 --> 01:04:28,425
l'll kill her. l'll kill her with the virus.

393
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:38,738
Let me go.

394
01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:09,738
F.B.l, Suruga.

395
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:13,301
After Watari's death, we'll protect you.

396
01:05:16,547 --> 01:05:18,105
That's encouraging.

397
01:05:18,649 --> 01:05:20,480
- This way.
- No!

398
01:05:22,787 --> 01:05:25,187
The Countermeasure Transfer Room is in here.

399
01:05:34,365 --> 01:05:36,856
What in the world is this?

400
01:05:37,568 --> 01:05:39,593
Crepe...

401
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:51,712
Please drive.

402
01:06:04,295 --> 01:06:06,855
Didn't the girl have the virus?

403
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:10,429
What happened to the antidote data?

404
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:18,802
Don't tell me it doesn't exist.

405
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:21,905
What's our next move?

406
01:06:22,513 --> 01:06:25,073
You're the developer. We can make the virus.

407
01:06:25,683 --> 01:06:28,652
But it's useless without the antidote.

408
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:30,913
You're right.

409
01:07:07,558 --> 01:07:09,025
He's ahead of us.

410
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:12,852
Shut down all L's access from the outside.

411
01:07:13,531 --> 01:07:14,463
Yes, ma'am.

412
01:07:23,841 --> 01:07:28,073
l can kill anyone l want now...

413
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,982
Do you think your dad sent you
to Watari for that purpose?

414
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:43,184
Dad is...dad is dead.

415
01:08:11,822 --> 01:08:15,485
You know this Watari person, don't you?

416
01:08:15,693 --> 01:08:18,787
Yes. l am L.

417
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:21,759
L...

418
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:34,339
They call themselves ''Blue Ship''...

419
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:37,447
an environmental group.

420
01:08:38,082 --> 01:08:42,849
That man with a scar is an extremist
using that as his cover.

421
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:46,586
But K is not a group member.

422
01:08:48,192 --> 01:08:49,750
- Mr. Suruga.
- What?

423
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,895
Turn left 30m ahead. We're getting out.

424
01:08:53,097 --> 01:08:55,531
- 30m...
- Over here.

425
01:08:55,733 --> 01:08:57,428
Here?

426
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:08,209
Let's go.

427
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:16,949
Let's meet here 2 hours later.

428
01:09:17,655 --> 01:09:20,215
Drive on as fast as you like.

429
01:09:24,094 --> 01:09:25,220
That means...

430
01:09:26,697 --> 01:09:29,029
Am l a decoy?

431
01:10:31,095 --> 01:10:34,155
Damn! They're persistent.

432
01:10:42,106 --> 01:10:43,733
What the hell are you doing?

433
01:10:43,941 --> 01:10:45,431
This is a one-way street. Stop.

434
01:10:49,947 --> 01:10:54,941
What're you doing?
l told you to stop, you bastard.

435
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:07,894
l said it's a one-way street. Stop.

436
01:11:10,033 --> 01:11:12,763
l said it's a one-way street. Stop.

437
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:17,833
Let me through. F.B.l. business.

438
01:11:18,575 --> 01:11:22,341
So what? Get out. You're Japanese, aren't you?

439
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:24,070
Look. F.B.l.

440
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:27,182
You're Japanese. You can't fool me.

441
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:41,821
Welcome, master.

442
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:43,793
Sorry l kept you waiting.

443
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:47,663
Please enjoy, master.

444
01:11:59,116 --> 01:12:00,344
He's strange.

445
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:05,079
Easy to call him that.

446
01:12:09,026 --> 01:12:14,054
They're Fibonacci Numbers.
He's a mathematical genius.

447
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:17,522
He's F's...

448
01:12:18,936 --> 01:12:20,870
A gift Watari left me.

449
01:12:25,976 --> 01:12:30,208
By the way, the virus you had seems to be...

450
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:32,281
a fake.

451
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,010
That's impossible.

452
01:12:34,418 --> 01:12:38,616
Your dad was infected right after contact.

453
01:12:39,223 --> 01:12:41,123
Your body temperature shows no change.

454
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:44,887
Body temperature?

455
01:12:56,306 --> 01:13:00,709
That might be the reason.

456
01:13:03,614 --> 01:13:06,412
Maki received an injection every 10 days.

457
01:13:12,122 --> 01:13:15,614
Dad didn't tell me what the injection was.

458
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:18,593
l see. You're saying the virus is restrained

459
01:13:19,296 --> 01:13:21,025
because of the injection.

460
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:25,130
lt can't be anything else.

461
01:13:27,704 --> 01:13:30,002
Does it mean Maki's body has both...

462
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:33,833
the virus and the hint to restrain the virus?

463
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,343
All the more, we must get her.

464
01:13:38,849 --> 01:13:40,510
- You go, too.
- Wait.

465
01:13:41,685 --> 01:13:43,312
Let's change our plan.

466
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:45,346
We don't have much time.

467
01:13:46,757 --> 01:13:49,726
lt seems we don't have much time.

468
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,225
Don't worry about it.

469
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:03,068
l, too, need to settle this in 6 days.

470
01:14:07,878 --> 01:14:10,574
Did she inject the virus by herself?

471
01:14:11,214 --> 01:14:12,078
Yes, she did.

472
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:17,212
Don't worry. ln the dormant stage,

473
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:20,681
no virus will be a threat.

474
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,984
l see...

475
01:14:25,195 --> 01:14:28,096
But before the virus takes effect,

476
01:14:28,966 --> 01:14:31,196
we need to travel a bit far.

477
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:33,334
With her?

478
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:38,029
lf the virus awakens, we'll be infected first.

479
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,338
We probably will.

480
01:14:43,547 --> 01:14:44,309
''L. Lawliet - Will quietly die...''

481
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:46,243
''of heart attack 23 days later.''

482
01:14:47,818 --> 01:14:52,846
Perhaps it won't be as ''quietly'' as l hope to.

483
01:14:57,127 --> 01:15:01,461
Leave the rest to the F.B.l.

484
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:09,938
Thank you. ln that case, Mr. Suruga,

485
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:13,031
l need a favor.

486
01:15:15,545 --> 01:15:17,240
Anything for you.

487
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:27,417
Damn.

488
01:15:27,858 --> 01:15:29,985
Made me a decoy again.

489
01:15:50,447 --> 01:15:51,744
Where're we going?

490
01:15:52,983 --> 01:15:56,077
To a man named Koichi Matsudo.

491
01:15:57,888 --> 01:15:59,116
Prof. Matsudo?

492
01:16:00,957 --> 01:16:05,018
l've met him before. But why do you know him?

493
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:13,030
When l looked at the book on
lnfectious Disease Center, his name and...

494
01:16:13,837 --> 01:16:16,362
your dad's were there as co-writers.

495
01:16:17,808 --> 01:16:19,833
''KOlCHl MATSUDO'' ''KlMlHlKO NlKAlDO''

496
01:16:25,315 --> 01:16:29,877
We interrupt this program for emergency news.

497
01:16:30,787 --> 01:16:33,847
A girl infected by a dangerous virus.

498
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:38,118
has escaped from a hospital.

499
01:16:38,662 --> 01:16:43,599
We have Dr. Kujo of the
lnfectious Disease Center here.

500
01:16:44,034 --> 01:16:46,901
Dr. Kujo, what kind of a virus is this?

501
01:16:47,104 --> 01:16:51,438
This virus is extremely infectious and...

502
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:55,370
there is no effective vaccine yet.

503
01:16:55,712 --> 01:16:58,806
lf symptoms appear, recovery is impossible.

504
01:16:59,149 --> 01:17:01,549
l can say the virus is lethal.

505
01:17:01,852 --> 01:17:06,312
This is Maki Nikaido, who is currently missing.

506
01:17:07,257 --> 01:17:11,557
She is 12 years old
and goes to a school in Saitama.

507
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:14,258
Body height 150cm.

508
01:17:14,464 --> 01:17:15,692
lmpossible.

509
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:20,666
She was last seen wearing
a navy blue school uniform.

510
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:36,776
Let's get off.
Can't use public transport anymore.

511
01:18:06,917 --> 01:18:12,719
A girl infected by a lethal virus
got off the train at this station.

512
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:15,950
The virus could be airborne.

513
01:18:16,293 --> 01:18:19,558
We are undertaking an infection test.

514
01:18:19,963 --> 01:18:24,366
Please cooperate to prevent the virus
from spreading.

515
01:18:25,068 --> 01:18:27,298
Please. We need your cooperation.

516
01:18:30,774 --> 01:18:33,299
We are looking for this girl.

517
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:35,774
Witness reports on the girl
infected by the virus.

518
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,808
Approximately 30,000.

519
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:08,903
We need some time to verify them.

520
01:19:55,659 --> 01:19:56,819
L...

521
01:19:59,095 --> 01:20:02,531
l'm really tired, L.

522
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:00,383
lt's ok. l knew this would happen

523
01:21:17,574 --> 01:21:20,668
Suruga, haven't you recovered Death Note yet?

524
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:23,869
L and l are moving separately now.

525
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,844
Separately? What do you mean?

526
01:21:27,117 --> 01:21:29,210
To gain L's trust.

527
01:21:29,452 --> 01:21:31,613
Why moving separately for that?

528
01:21:31,821 --> 01:21:36,485
But l promise to accomplish my mission.

529
01:21:42,265 --> 01:21:46,167
5 DAYS LEFT

530
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:58,802
You bastard.

531
01:23:01,377 --> 01:23:04,471
Move around with a virus infected person?

532
01:23:05,882 --> 01:23:10,649
lt's common sense to avoid
densely populated areas.

533
01:23:12,489 --> 01:23:14,480
lf the symptoms appeared?

534
01:23:18,995 --> 01:23:23,557
Not just Maki,
but everybody around her will be involved.

535
01:23:27,437 --> 01:23:31,339
Are you listening?

536
01:23:47,457 --> 01:23:49,322
Absolutely irresponsible.

537
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:55,323
What is it?

538
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:06,869
Quarantine me.

539
01:24:15,318 --> 01:24:17,047
Have the symptoms...?

540
01:24:24,594 --> 01:24:27,062
You're all right.

541
01:24:28,364 --> 01:24:31,299
You must've run through the woods.

542
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:34,794
lt's a tick bite.

543
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:42,110
Come with me.

544
01:24:47,216 --> 01:24:48,808
What d'you plan to do?

545
01:24:49,719 --> 01:24:51,687
Maki is fighting that horror.

546
01:24:51,888 --> 01:24:57,224
That's why we need someone
who can make the antidote.

547
01:24:58,061 --> 01:24:58,993
l can't.

548
01:24:59,195 --> 01:25:01,561
Prof. Nikaido could, though.

549
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,031
l'm...

550
01:25:07,003 --> 01:25:08,595
l'm scared.

551
01:25:11,674 --> 01:25:14,472
The vaccine l developed killed people.

552
01:25:15,612 --> 01:25:17,944
So, l'm scared.

553
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:23,115
There are lives l have sacrificed, too.

554
01:25:24,287 --> 01:25:25,652
But now,

555
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:29,690
l can't abandon the life before me.

556
01:25:39,936 --> 01:25:41,096
Hi, Mr. Noda.

557
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:43,568
Oh, hi, Prof. Matsudo.

558
01:25:52,949 --> 01:25:54,974
l'll be using the lab again.

559
01:25:55,184 --> 01:25:59,848
l hope you have permission from the professor?

560
01:26:39,595 --> 01:26:43,258
4 DAYS LEFT

561
01:28:03,746 --> 01:28:07,842
3 DAYS LEFT

562
01:28:13,923 --> 01:28:15,788
Find out anything?

563
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:26,734
lt's energy source is sugar.

564
01:28:26,936 --> 01:28:29,461
lt likes sugar, but not fruit sugar.

565
01:28:31,774 --> 01:28:33,241
Sugar?

566
01:28:35,778 --> 01:28:38,212
Maki basically has low blood sugar.

567
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:45,287
The virus probably wasn't active inside her

568
01:28:47,056 --> 01:28:48,853
because of that.

569
01:28:49,992 --> 01:28:52,893
Not because of her dad's injection?

570
01:28:54,397 --> 01:28:57,662
The injection was probably for her
low blood sugar.

571
01:29:00,937 --> 01:29:06,204
Does determining the energy source
help in developing the antidote?

572
01:29:07,777 --> 01:29:08,766
No.

573
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:15,344
Destroying the sugar in the body
will kill the virus,

574
01:29:17,253 --> 01:29:20,848
but that would stop the body activity.

575
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:30,427
13:11

576
01:29:31,601 --> 01:29:32,659
What?

577
01:29:38,574 --> 01:29:40,974
Please be quiet for a while.

578
01:30:05,134 --> 01:30:06,362
What is that?

579
01:30:14,944 --> 01:30:16,639
M... K

580
01:30:17,713 --> 01:30:19,044
So, what is it?

581
01:30:19,749 --> 01:30:20,773
lt's a code.

582
01:30:20,983 --> 01:30:23,611
But where did you see this?

583
01:30:23,886 --> 01:30:27,686
That's the homework my dad gave me.

584
01:30:37,566 --> 01:30:40,364
lt's a message from Prof. Nikaido.

585
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:45,336
What could MK mean?

586
01:30:52,982 --> 01:30:54,506
Prof. Matsudo. Tell me if any word

587
01:30:54,717 --> 01:30:56,275
draws your attention.

588
01:31:08,064 --> 01:31:09,531
... Midkine

589
01:31:10,299 --> 01:31:11,391
That's it.

590
01:31:14,003 --> 01:31:17,939
Midkine may be able to suppress the virus.

591
01:31:18,307 --> 01:31:21,003
So that's what it is.

592
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:24,304
lt's a protein, which creates and breeds cells.

593
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:28,038
Restores broken cells
and stops cancer from progressing.

594
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:33,381
Restores nerve cells,
so it may be a wonder drug for Alzheimer.

595
01:31:37,126 --> 01:31:41,722
ls it possible to artificially synthesize Midkine?

596
01:31:42,565 --> 01:31:47,127
Yes, with 10 billion yen research fee and 5 years.

597
01:31:49,672 --> 01:31:51,367
5 years...

598
01:31:53,409 --> 01:31:57,072
But l'll think of some ways to do that.

599
01:31:59,248 --> 01:32:00,772
For example,

600
01:32:03,085 --> 01:32:06,418
Midkine is abundant in a fetus.

601
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:16,057
lt has to be a fetus.

602
01:32:19,635 --> 01:32:24,129
He's a survivor of the village
destroyed by that virus.

603
01:32:27,276 --> 01:32:28,436
He was examined,

604
01:32:28,644 --> 01:32:33,411
but not for MK proteins.

605
01:32:42,091 --> 01:32:45,527
Let me take some of your blood.

606
01:33:01,343 --> 01:33:03,106
Ah, that feels good.

607
01:33:05,514 --> 01:33:09,348
There will be a series of tests from tomorrow.

608
01:33:11,487 --> 01:33:12,818
l know that.

609
01:33:22,898 --> 01:33:24,456
C'mon. Let's eat.

610
01:33:24,834 --> 01:33:25,892
Wait.

611
01:33:53,062 --> 01:33:54,586
Let's eat.

612
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:56,224
Let's eat.

613
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:09,600
Why do you only eat sweets?

614
01:34:10,713 --> 01:34:15,116
Sugar is an essential energy source
of the brain and...

615
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:16,841
Over eating is bad.

616
01:34:18,554 --> 01:34:19,851
You'll die.

617
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,752
You may be right.

618
01:34:27,463 --> 01:34:28,691
You should...

619
01:34:30,099 --> 01:34:32,329
straighten your back, too.

620
01:35:45,374 --> 01:35:47,103
l'm going to the bathroom.

621
01:37:32,481 --> 01:37:33,675
Maki.

622
01:37:36,785 --> 01:37:38,184
Thanks for the call.

623
01:38:03,178 --> 01:38:04,167
l'll kill you.

624
01:38:06,081 --> 01:38:08,914
Can't kill you when the antidote is made.

625
01:38:10,352 --> 01:38:11,842
l'll kill you before that.

626
01:38:20,763 --> 01:38:25,200
Sorry. l broke the promise to come alone.

627
01:38:28,203 --> 01:38:29,500
You coward!

628
01:39:19,455 --> 01:39:24,552
They are searching for the reason
why symptoms don't appear on Maki

629
01:39:25,561 --> 01:39:27,722
to develop the antidote.

630
01:39:28,030 --> 01:39:29,361
No, Dr. Kujo's aware...

631
01:39:30,098 --> 01:39:33,829
Maki's symptoms can appear any time.

632
01:39:34,870 --> 01:39:37,202
Then, why take Maki?

633
01:39:38,307 --> 01:39:42,641
Maki is a perfect vessel
for secretly carrying the virus.

634
01:39:47,816 --> 01:39:51,274
Please continue to work on the antidote.

635
01:39:53,222 --> 01:39:55,122
We'll need a lot of it.

636
01:40:05,367 --> 01:40:06,629
You know what to do?

637
01:40:11,874 --> 01:40:12,966
Wait a minute.

638
01:40:32,928 --> 01:40:34,657
ls it finished?

639
01:40:35,264 --> 01:40:36,856
Hasn't been tested yet.

640
01:40:39,768 --> 01:40:41,133
You're incredible.

641
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:44,001
l'll get to work.

642
01:40:45,741 --> 01:40:47,709
and make as much as l can.

643
01:40:53,382 --> 01:40:54,713
Please do so.

644
01:41:07,529 --> 01:41:12,193
l didn't expect a child
to stake her life for revenge.

645
01:41:15,437 --> 01:41:17,962
Her dad was killed before her eyes.

646
01:41:19,474 --> 01:41:20,839
Can't blame her.

647
01:41:26,648 --> 01:41:28,411
You may be right.

648
01:41:37,926 --> 01:41:40,360
lf Kujo is escaping from Japan,

649
01:41:41,263 --> 01:41:45,529
does that mean they've developed the antidote?

650
01:41:45,734 --> 01:41:48,032
No. By taking Maki,

651
01:41:48,337 --> 01:41:53,206
she deceives the Blue Ship members
that the antidote is completed.

652
01:41:55,477 --> 01:41:59,607
How does Kujo intend to scatter the virus?

653
01:42:00,215 --> 01:42:04,743
They could disguise as a emergency patient
and medical staff.

654
01:42:05,053 --> 01:42:07,419
lt has less procedure to clear the
boarding procedure. They can easily board a plane.

655
01:42:07,623 --> 01:42:10,217
Then, hijack the plane.

656
01:42:11,026 --> 01:42:13,085
- To where?
- Probably to the U.S.

657
01:42:14,229 --> 01:42:15,491
To the U.S.?

658
01:42:15,697 --> 01:42:18,393
Matoba may have chosen the destination.

659
01:42:18,834 --> 01:42:23,737
As you said,
Matoba uses the ecology group as his front.

660
01:42:24,506 --> 01:42:27,600
Matoba has no principles, just greed.

661
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:33,573
People with greed will head
for the most profitable country.

662
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:38,584
2 DAYS LEFT

663
01:42:42,057 --> 01:42:44,116
Please.

664
01:42:46,728 --> 01:42:48,593
JNA flight 204, right?

665
01:42:49,665 --> 01:42:53,431
Attending personnel are Dr. Kimiko Kujo...

666
01:42:53,635 --> 01:42:56,160
And myself, Daisuke Matoba.

667
01:42:56,772 --> 01:42:58,137
Let me see the papers.

668
01:43:09,885 --> 01:43:12,115
ls she Mayumi Honda?

669
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:13,184
Yes.

670
01:43:14,256 --> 01:43:16,520
l wish for a successful operation.

671
01:43:31,907 --> 01:43:35,070
Good morning.
Thank you for boarding JNA flight 204.

672
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:42,180
l burned Death Note. l no longer have it.

673
01:43:42,818 --> 01:43:46,083
l'm sorry l couldn't help your mission.

674
01:43:46,888 --> 01:43:47,877
l see...

675
01:43:52,627 --> 01:43:53,855
But l...

676
01:43:54,896 --> 01:43:55,863
L

677
01:43:57,432 --> 01:43:59,764
l want to help you.

678
01:44:33,235 --> 01:44:35,328
Good morning, passengers.

679
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:39,936
This is your captain, Saito.
A message from Control Room.

680
01:44:40,809 --> 01:44:43,912
We are ready to take off,

681
01:44:43,912 --> 01:44:45,106
but have just received...

682
01:44:45,313 --> 01:44:46,644
a report from the control tower.

683
01:44:47,082 --> 01:44:50,074
A suspicious vehicle is in the runway.

684
01:44:50,819 --> 01:44:55,620
We have been requested to be on standby
at this location.

685
01:44:56,324 --> 01:44:58,918
We will inform you of any further development.

686
01:44:59,127 --> 01:45:00,685
We appreciate your patience.

687
01:45:01,429 --> 01:45:02,987
Thank you for your cooperation.

688
01:45:12,641 --> 01:45:14,905
- What're you doing?
- Make way.

689
01:45:16,378 --> 01:45:17,345
Make way.

690
01:45:24,686 --> 01:45:26,017
Anything wrong?

691
01:45:47,075 --> 01:45:48,007
Don't move.

692
01:45:49,678 --> 01:45:51,009
What's going on?

693
01:45:51,379 --> 01:45:54,314
We only take action above the U.S.

694
01:45:54,649 --> 01:45:55,843
Don't be so rigid.

695
01:45:57,352 --> 01:45:58,944
Change in schedule.

696
01:46:10,999 --> 01:46:13,126
We'll be safe, right?

697
01:46:14,035 --> 01:46:15,627
You'll soon find out.

698
01:46:18,006 --> 01:46:19,405
What d'you mean?

699
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:24,144
Didn't we have an injection?

700
01:46:25,647 --> 01:46:28,207
l didn't make any antidote.

701
01:46:33,221 --> 01:46:35,212
You tricked us?

702
01:46:35,757 --> 01:46:39,557
A buyer's paying $10 million
for the virus and the antidote.

703
01:46:40,095 --> 01:46:41,756
Your true aim.

704
01:46:43,765 --> 01:46:47,496
Wait a minute. We'll all die.

705
01:46:47,702 --> 01:46:50,330
lf you're gonna die, die alone.

706
01:47:00,548 --> 01:47:02,015
We'll all die.

707
01:47:07,489 --> 01:47:09,787
l don't wanna die. Help me.

708
01:47:09,991 --> 01:47:16,988
Dr. Kujo, help me. Help me.

709
01:47:33,415 --> 01:47:34,109
Captain.

710
01:47:37,018 --> 01:47:40,419
Oh, no. The girl on TV is on this plane.

711
01:47:40,689 --> 01:47:41,713
What's wrong?

712
01:47:59,207 --> 01:48:00,139
All right?

713
01:48:01,242 --> 01:48:02,174
Be quiet.

714
01:48:08,249 --> 01:48:10,774
Earth is finished anyway.

715
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:16,218
Take off.

716
01:48:16,725 --> 01:48:18,852
Finished...Damn.

717
01:48:21,129 --> 01:48:22,289
So, we're finished.

718
01:48:23,231 --> 01:48:24,721
Don't move.

719
01:48:31,373 --> 01:48:32,305
Stop it.

720
01:48:48,556 --> 01:48:49,716
lt's moving.

721
01:50:09,604 --> 01:50:11,401
Hey, hang on.

722
01:50:15,110 --> 01:50:16,577
Don't mind them.

723
01:50:17,212 --> 01:50:21,410
lt's merely a minor sacrifice for a big purpose.

724
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:23,146
Whatever...

725
01:50:24,552 --> 01:50:29,080
the reason may be, murder is always a bad thing.

726
01:50:34,395 --> 01:50:37,694
Too bad. lt's too late now.

727
01:50:37,899 --> 01:50:39,332
lt's not too late.

728
01:50:42,837 --> 01:50:44,532
The antidote.

729
01:50:47,575 --> 01:50:49,566
We've succeeded.

730
01:50:50,111 --> 01:50:53,205
We can save them all.

731
01:51:26,648 --> 01:51:28,912
lnject this to everyone.

732
01:51:33,755 --> 01:51:35,279
You've done enough damage.

733
01:51:40,795 --> 01:51:42,456
We don't need that.

734
01:51:42,664 --> 01:51:46,794
This girl and everyone else here can die.

735
01:51:58,079 --> 01:52:02,243
Like she said, we'll all die.

736
01:52:03,918 --> 01:52:08,878
Mankind, which destroys environment
and wages war, should die.

737
01:52:09,257 --> 01:52:12,192
Correct ecosystem will save the world.

738
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:16,863
ls this what Watari hoped for?

739
01:52:44,792 --> 01:52:47,226
He said: ''Make the world better.''

740
01:52:47,495 --> 01:52:52,558
So, destroy mankind. You must take over this plan.

741
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,097
l decline.

742
01:52:55,003 --> 01:52:59,167
Mankind must have the power to change its future.

743
01:53:04,345 --> 01:53:05,812
lt's too late.

744
01:53:06,681 --> 01:53:10,708
The plane will fly. Everybody dies,
and the virus will scatter.

745
01:53:10,918 --> 01:53:11,885
No.

746
01:53:14,055 --> 01:53:17,957
The magnetic wave of
this is enough to crash the plane.

747
01:53:18,192 --> 01:53:21,753
The virus will fall into the sea
and become harmless.

748
01:53:22,363 --> 01:53:23,990
lt's checkmate.

749
01:53:27,468 --> 01:53:30,733
lf you're alive, you can start over.

750
01:53:30,938 --> 01:53:35,238
No one has the right to take that away.

751
01:53:37,145 --> 01:53:38,908
Start over...

752
01:53:49,223 --> 01:53:53,091
By my contract with Death, l'll die 2 days later.

753
01:53:53,294 --> 01:53:55,125
Death...

754
01:53:56,064 --> 01:53:57,691
You must live on.

755
01:53:58,166 --> 01:54:01,260
lt's Watari's wish.

756
01:54:25,993 --> 01:54:27,290
lnject these to everyone.

757
01:54:27,495 --> 01:54:28,462
OK.

758
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:33,589
All right?

759
01:54:35,370 --> 01:54:37,565
Enough antidote for everyone.

760
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:39,870
OK.

761
01:54:40,541 --> 01:54:41,872
Hurry. Take these.

762
01:56:05,059 --> 01:56:06,117
What will you do?

763
01:56:35,723 --> 01:56:36,985
l'm okay.

764
01:56:41,762 --> 01:56:43,195
l'm okay now.

765
01:56:50,004 --> 01:56:53,565
You're a good girl. l believed in you.

766
01:58:12,954 --> 01:58:14,819
l am honored to work under

767
01:58:16,524 --> 01:58:19,857
the command of the legendary L.

768
01:58:22,029 --> 01:58:23,929
l was not in command.

769
01:58:26,467 --> 01:58:29,061
Mr. Suruga, l'm glad l trusted you.

770
01:58:29,904 --> 01:58:31,895
Thank you very much.

771
01:58:42,783 --> 01:58:45,775
l still have 2 more days.

772
01:59:27,728 --> 01:59:29,525
This is from L.

773
01:59:40,675 --> 01:59:43,143
Maki, welcome home.

774
01:59:44,512 --> 01:59:46,309
Did you have a good day?

775
01:59:55,122 --> 01:59:56,350
Yes.

776
01:59:58,325 --> 02:00:00,350
The 5 days were good.

777
02:00:01,495 --> 02:00:03,759
Maki, welcome home.

778
02:00:06,834 --> 02:00:09,496
Make tomorrow a good day, too.

779
02:00:21,015 --> 02:00:22,710
Same to you.

780
02:00:24,485 --> 02:00:25,850
L...

781
02:00:59,086 --> 02:01:02,453
1 DAY LEFT

782
02:01:03,057 --> 02:01:04,319
ls this him?

783
02:01:04,625 --> 02:01:05,421
Yes.

784
02:01:09,330 --> 02:01:13,858
There is one thing l want you to remember.

785
02:01:15,936 --> 02:01:17,767
No matter how gifted,

786
02:01:18,139 --> 02:01:20,972
you alone cannot change the world.

787
02:01:23,911 --> 02:01:28,644
But that's the wonderful thing about this world.

788
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:34,753
l will give a name to this boy.

789
02:01:35,222 --> 02:01:38,191
Watari would've wanted you to do so.

790
02:01:46,934 --> 02:01:50,335
''Near'' is a good name.

791
02:01:51,272 --> 02:01:55,106
You will always be near when someone is saved.

792
02:02:15,529 --> 02:02:18,862
Find happiness, ''Near''.

793
02:03:02,676 --> 02:03:03,802
Watari.

794
02:03:04,879 --> 02:03:06,278
l want to live

795
02:03:07,848 --> 02:03:11,978
a little bit more in this world.
