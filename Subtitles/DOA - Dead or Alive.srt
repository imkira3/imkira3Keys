There is no body.

6
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,970
Then he is not dead.

- I am going to find him.
- The guards won't let you leave.

I alone determine my destiny.

But, Princess, as your brother's best friend
you must let me help you.

10

If my brother is really dead
then you are no longer his best friend.

Princess Kasumi, if you leave
you suffer the same fate as your brother.

I am your servant. But if you leave,
I'm honor-bound to kill you.

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,420
Thank you.
And how do our contestants look?

160
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,340
We got a strong group, sir.
They look really good.

161
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,720
Bring up Tina Armstrong.
I was impressed with her musculature.

Princess Kasumi, sister of Hayate.

It is an honor to meet you.

196
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,500
I came to find my brother.
I have been told he died last year at DOA.

197
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,550
I want to know what happened.

198
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,850
Your brother was a great and noble fighter.
He met his end with dignity.

199
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,680
Hayate was matched against Leon.

200
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,190
Hayate fell from this very balcony.
We never found his body.

201
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,530
I hope you would choose to stay with us
at the tournament

202
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,580
and fight in the same spirit
that made your brother so great.

203
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,840
You will win DOA.
You're the best in the world.

204
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Thank you, little sister.

- No.

207
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,230
You have to stay and lead the clan.

208
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,940
Farewell, Kasumi.
Hayabusa will protect you.

209
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,120
Hayabusa, why do you invade
my privacy this way?

210
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,880
- She is here.
- I know. I have seen her.

211
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:18,800
I beg you once again, Princess.
Go home. Ask for forgiveness.

212
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,180
You have a responsibility to your people.

213
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,350
But I also have a responsibility
to my brother.

214
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:32,320
Donavan is lying. He says Leon
killed Hayate above the Buddha head.

215
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,990
- Why would he lie?
- I am convinced he is hiding the truth.

216
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,830
What do you propose to do?

217
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,790
Find my brother.

218
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,290
Then I will help you.
Hayate was like a brother to me, too.

219
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,930
Be careful, Kasumi.

220
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,530
- I knew you'd miss me.
- That's presumptuous.

221

No, it's Perrier Jouet Belle Epoch '88.
Your favorite.

222
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,670
So how did you survive the first round?

223
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,670
I feigned an injury so Zack went through.

224
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,510
You know I set you up in Hong Kong
on purpose.

225
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,800
You'd never have come here
if you'd gotten away with all that money.

226
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,310
And you wouldn't have been invited to DOA

227
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,680
without demolishing the pride
of the Hong Kong police.

228
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,400
Don't tell me you want me to help you
steal the $10 million prize money.

229

What's the catch?

232
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,870
Well, we have to find the vault
and we have to crack the code. The usual.

233
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:14,250
- Shall I tell you more?
- Later.

234
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:19,340
Right now I'd prefer you do something else
with your mouth.

235
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,680
Well, well, well.
Don't you just love this place?

236
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,070
Know what I especially love?

237
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,240
The view.

238
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,620
- Want some?
- I'll pass.

239
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:56,000
- It's been quite a day, sir.
- I want to see Kasumi in action.

240
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:00,800
Her data is stronger than I expected.
Let's match her against Leon.

241
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,680
Leon? That's harsh.

242
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,720
Now that she's decided to stay,
let's see how she compares to her brother.

243
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,220
All right.

will you repent for leaving the clan?

246
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,810

00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,250
You want to play, little girl?

251
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,320
So, according to my source,
Helena is the key.

252
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,070
Helena is the key?

(CHUCKLES)

254
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,910
- I felt the earth move.
- Yeah, that's the desired effect.

255
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,830
No, really, I felt the earth move.

256
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,480
Come on, loosen up.
You're way too beautiful to be this tense.

257
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:20,440
Maybe a little quality time with Zack
will loosen you up.

258
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,300
You couldn't have killed my brother.

259
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,230
Close your eyes.

260
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,980
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

261
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,360
- You're wearing way too much clothing.
- Hey, now.

262
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,320
Come to daddy. Lay it on me.

263
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,660
Oh, shit!

264
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,630
Tina!

DONOVAN: Quite a fight.

266

One quarter final spot left.

268
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,930
Looks like a father-daughter
grudge match. Yeah.

00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,890
Thanks for letting me sleep here.
My room is an absolute wreck.

Tina! It's show time!

00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,740
Dad! Not now. I'm in my underwear.

272
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,570
Which I hate.

273

Why you can't just sleep in the nude
like me, I'll never know.

- No. Dad, she's just another fighter.

- Yeah, I can see that.

No, no. I mean, we're not sleeping together,

we're just sleeping.

278

It seems to be like my baby girl's found
herself a special friend.

279
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,760
We'll settle up tomorrow, sweetie.
Nice to meet you, miss.

Big day tomorrow fighting Daddy.

284
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,490
Dr. Donovan, you should take a look at this.

285
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:39,410
Have you seen this Max character?
A DOA fighter. Yeah, right.

286
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,410
This guy's a total fake.
We should kick him off the island.

287
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,880
You're just worried this phony's
making the moves on your dream girl.

288
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:53,010
I can have him removed from DOA island,
or I can have some fun.

289
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,220
- Punch up Bayman.
- Good call, sir.

290
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,600
Hey, buddy, your time's up.

291
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,570
You know, that was an accident. I...

292
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,620
Wow.

293
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:35,050
I had the worst sleep ever last night.
Christie kept stealing all the blankets.

294
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,140
You know, are you sure
this is such a good idea?

295
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,010
Because those things look really sharp.

296
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,980
Acupuncture has many medicinal qualities.

297
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,440
But in a ninja's hands, it can be lethal.

298
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,910
That actually feels better.

299
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,740
Tina!

300
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,370
Careful, baby.

301
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,000
Sweetie? I've come at a bad time again,
haven't I?

302
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,250
- Does Christie know about you two?
- Dad!

303
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,550
You know what?
Let's just go ahead and get this over with.

My raft, my rules.
Whoever falls in the water first loses.

305
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,720
Fair enough, Tina.

306
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,030
- No! Dad, you bit me!
- Sorry. Old wrestling reflex.

307
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,410
Dad, you have to understand.
I'm here to prove that I'm not a fake.

308
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:51,130
Even if that means I have to hurt you.

309
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,100
Nice try, sweetie.

310
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,700
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.

311
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,880
Yes!

312
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,630
Yeah!

01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:42,780
Well, I'm afraid that's not
the only thing you don't know.

469
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:45,830
Donovan has taken my concept
and used it for his own ends.

470
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:48,250
So stupid.
I should have done something earlier.

471
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:52,460
Now it's time to harvest.

472
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,510
(BEEPING)

473
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,300
(ALARM SOUNDING)

474
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:00,550
Okay, now what?

475
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,550
Donovan has begun the download.
We got to go!

476
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,020
- Do you think it will really work?
- Of course! I created it!

477
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:15,790
Look.

478
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,130
- Help them.
- I'm on it. I'm on it.

479
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:21,550
Come on. Come on.

480
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,930
I've got to bypass
four security protocols to free them.

481
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:26,220
Not easy.

482
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,730
Now for the ultimate test.
The moment I've had to wait a year for.

483
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,990
I've kept him in superb fighting condition.

484
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:46,950
Send him in.

485
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:58,790
(GASPS)

486
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:03,920
Hayate! My brother.

487
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,690
- Hayate.
- Kasumi.

488
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:25,490
Kasumi!

489
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:33,410
Kasumi, I was afraid
you would come looking for me.

490
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:37,120
Hayabusa.

491
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,460
How could you let this happen?

492
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:47,760
- Your sister has the same strong will as you.
- Yes, she does.

493
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:53,980
But she lacks that perfect blend of skills,
timing and strength

494
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:58,100
that set you apart
as the world's greatest warrior.

495
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:01,980
You have me. Let them go.

496
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:08,660
First things first. I challenge you to a fight.

497
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,240
You win, they all go free.

498
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:19,830
If you refuse my simple request, they die.

499
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,210
Your choice.

500
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,730
So be it.

501
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:51,720
Hayate!

502
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,390
- No!
- Hayate!

503
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:57,870
Ayane.

504
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:03,330
I thought you were dead.

505
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:09,000
I will never leave your side.

506
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,350
- Come on.
- We're almost there.

507
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,570
Buyers from around the world,

508
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:19,450
I hope you've enjoyed
this live demonstration

509
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:22,490
of the sheer power of this new technology.

510
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:25,660
Thank you for your down payments.

511
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:30,170
Transmission to you of the download
program will begin immediately.

512
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:43,100
- What's going on?
- Oh, no.

513
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:45,430
- This is not good.
- What's not good?

514
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,310
Donovan's transmitting the program
to buyers across the world.

515
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:53,650
I have to stop him.

516
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:18,800
What?

517
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,880
That was close.

518
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:22,350
Okay, time to call the cavalry.

519
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:25,600
Donavan needs to know this is over.

520
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,270
(SIGHS)

521
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,820
What now?

522
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:43,030
Bayman, grab the money from the vault.
Meet me outside the lab.

523
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:47,620
Look! He's headed this way.

524
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,870
I need more time to free the others.

525
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:15,110
Show me the money.

526
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:24,870
Oh, no, no, listen. I can explain. Look, just...

527
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:35,130
You're not gonna get away
with this, Donovan.

528
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:39,920
That's exactly what your father said
right before I had him killed.

529
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:11,660
What a shame.
You didn't download my moves.

530
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:14,670
I think I underestimated you, Helena.

531
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:27,140
You believe the CIA will stop me?
I don't think so.

532
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:32,220
I'll take this. All your hard work right here.

533
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,110
By the time they get here,
this place will be dust.

Donovan's getting away.

- No, I'm not leaving the money.

you don't have a crush on?

You can have him,
but what about the other 300?
