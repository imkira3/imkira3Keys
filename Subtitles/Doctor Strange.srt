Yes.

How did you correct a complete

00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,651
Well, I didn't correct it.

380
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,115
He couldn't walk.

381
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,616
I convinced him that he could.

382
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,701
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

383
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,745
When you reattach a severed nerve...

384
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,285
is it you who heals it
back together or the body?

385
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,365
It's the cells.

386
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,034
The cells are only programmed...

387
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,237
to put themselves back together
in very specific ways.

388
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,286
Right.

389
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,832
What if I told you that
your own body could be convinced...

390
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,169
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

391

is your treatment?

00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,183

- Acupuncture, great.
- Yeah?

413
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,691

about healing through belief?

419
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,420

to see more, to know more.

423
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,261
Now, on hearing that it can be widened...

424
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,263
in ways you can't imagine...

425
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,924
you reject the possibility.

426
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,569
No, I reject it because
I do not believe in fairy tales...

427
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,266
about chakras or energy...

428
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,013

you see through me, do you?

I wanted the power

Not even Dormammu?

He offers immortality.

1163

It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

Because you might not like them?
