<i>[Boy] In a world
full of superheroes,</i>

3
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,997
<i>there are two
that stand above the rest:</i>

4
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,694
<i>The Commander and Jetstream. </i>

5
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,738
<i>His super-strength makes him
pretty much indestructible. </i>

6
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,705
<i>She has the power of supersonic flight</i>

7
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,470
<i>along with a total mastery
of unarmed combat. </i>

8
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,103
<i>By day, they live
as Steve and Josie Stronghold,</i>

9
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,273
<i>the top real estate agents
in the metropolis of Maxville. </i>

10
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,785
<i>But whenever duty calls, they are
the Commander and Jetstream. </i>

11
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,979
<i>Me, I have my
own names for them:</i>

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,785
<i>Mom and Dad.
That's me in the middle. </i>

13
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,553
<i>You look at them and see
the defenders of the world. </i>

14
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,221
<i>All I see is my dad
wearing tights. </i>

15
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:06,561
<i>Don't get me wrong. It can be cool
to have superhero parents,</i>

16
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:10,660
<i>like when Mom picks up awesome takeout
on her way home from work. </i>

17
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,797
<i>On the other hand,
living up to the family name</i>

18
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:17,172
<i>means that I'm supposed
to save the world someday. </i>

19
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,574
Here we go.

20
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,239

[Straining] Come on.

23
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,255
Come on.

24
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,435
Exactly what we want to hear.

25
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,267
- [Beeping]
- Well, that was Bert Timmerman

26
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,807
and he is buying the colonial
on Pine Terrace.

27
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,639
Above asking.
No contingencies.

28
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:55,670
Honey, I know that selling real estate
is just our cover,

29
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:59,809
but I think we're in line to win
that sales trip to Hawaii.

30
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,822
We haven't been to Hawaii since
King Kamehamayhem set off that volcano.

31
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,484
Think of it, Josie:
You, me on the beach,

32
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,151
no exploding volcanoes.

33
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,156
Mmm, I can feel the sand
in my toes already.

34
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,632
[Giggling] Will is gonna be down
any minute.

35
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,864
Hey, it's his first day of school.
Where is he?

36
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,497
[Steve] Will?

37
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,201
Will?

38
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,485
Oh! Ah!

39
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,115
Come on, buddy.
Let's get moving!

40
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,285
- [Knocking]
- [Will] Two hundred!

41
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,626
Oh, hey, Dad. Just trying to
get a few sets in before school.

42
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,221
Low weights, high rep, huh?

43
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,324
Good thinking.
Don't want to bulk up.

44
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,097
Nah, going more for definition.

45
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,466
[Sighs] Big day, huh?

46
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,471
Will? [sighs]

47
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,875
I just want you to know
how proud I am

48
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,243
that you'll be attending
my alma mater

49
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,215
and someday following me
into the family business.

50
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,081
Real estate?

51
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,414
Right.

52
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,476
Real estate.

53
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,254
On a more serious note, son,

54
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,452
I know that every kid
thinks his dad's invincible

55
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,496
and I nearly am,
but who knows?

56
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:22,592
Maybe the next time I punch
a meteor hurtling toward Earth,

57
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,298
I'll be the one who shatters
into a million pieces.

58
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,637
I- I guess all I'm trying
to say here, Will,

59
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,940
is it's nice to know
that whatever happens to me,

60
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,378
you'll still be around
to save the world.

61
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,349
- Looking forward to it.
- We all are.

62
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,155
- Oh! Hey!
- Oof!

63
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,825
[Crashing]

64
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,726
- Good morning, Mrs. Stronghold.
- Mornin'.

65
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,991
I noticed you had
recyclables in the trash.

66
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,158
I took the liberty
of moving them for you.

67
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,168
Thank you, Layla.
You hungry?

68
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,966
I've got plenty of eggs, bacon.

69
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,371
No, thanks. You know how my mom
can communicate with animals?

70
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,036
Apparently, they
don't like being eaten.

71
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,739
- How about some juice?
- Great.

72
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,305
He's on his way.
Oh, hi, Layla.

73
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,250
- Good morning, Commander.
- Commander, huh?

74
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,380
Oh. Thanks, Layla.

75
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,618
[Josie] I can't believe you and
Will are starting high school.

76
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,092
Seems like yesterday you two
were swimming naked in the kiddie pool.

77
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,096
<i>- Mom! Hi, Layla.

<i>- [Layla] Thank you.

79
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,460
Josie, it's... the other one.

80
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,201
<i>- Go.
- [Indistinct voice on phone]</i>

81
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,265
I see.

82
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,873
Thank you, Mayor.

83
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,107
There's trouble downtown.

84
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,713
Big trouble. Downtown.

85
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,221
Oh, shoot, and I really wanted
to see Will off to the bus.

86
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,656
I remember his first day of preschool.
He wouldn't let go of my leg.

87
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,192
- Mom!
- Oh.

88
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,249
[Steve] Josie.

89
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,324
Oh, Will, uh, a reminder.

90
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,493
A lot of the kids at Sky High

91
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,264
will only have one
superhero parent, not two,

92
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,102
so take it easy on them, huh?
No showing off.

93
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,802
Aw, Dad. Not to worry.
I'll keep it low-key.

94
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,345
Mrs. Rivera?
Josie Stronghold.

95
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,938
I'm gonna need to reschedule
that open house.

96
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,539
Great.

97
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,881
- Steve!
- Gotta go!

98
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,618

What if he forgets his lunch?

to stop babying the boy.

Shh! What are you, crazy?

No, no. Sorry.

- So he can sit with his girlfriend.

Layla? No, she's just my friend.

Hey, Layla.

How was your summer?

No. No, no.

158

160
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,605
That's great.
So, what-what is it?

Don't miss the bus,

Good morning.
I am Principal Powers.

00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,443
On behalf of all
the faculty and staff,

220
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,783
welcome to Sky High.

221
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,288
Yeah!

222
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,786
In a few moments you will
go through Power Placement

223
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,023
and your own heroic journey
will begin.

224
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,089
- "Power placement"?
- Sounds fascist.

Power Placement: It's how
they decide where you go.

The hero track
or the loser track.

Th-th-there's a loser track?

is gonna work.

You will step up here
and show me your power.

And, yes, you will do so
in front of the entire class.

"whiner babies,"

no whiner babies.

...I just go by Mr. Boy.

But this year,
it will be my privilege

to help each of you become

00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,237
the very best hero support
that you can be.

537
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,606
Without hero support,

538
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,840
why, there wouldn't be any heroes.

539
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,542
All right, there probably
would be heroes,

540
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,982
but they would be very lonely.

541
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,749
Lonely heroes indeed.
And...

542
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,683
Yes?

543
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,055
Uh, yeah, um,

544
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,617
when do we pick
our names and costumes?

545
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,323
Because I call dibs
on "Zach Attack. "

546
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,866
Well, you don't get to pick.

547
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:59,267
On graduation day,
you'll be assigned to your hero,

548
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:02,067
and then he or she will, uh,

549
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,507
decide what you will be called
and what you will wear.

550
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,377
I think this is mostly done in an
attempt to avoid clashing colors.

red, white and blue it was,

553

which for me was a very
good thing because,

554
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:22,552
uh, as you can see, blue
really just makes my eyes pop!

555
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,561

- Huh.

mentioned me to you.

00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,450
I don't... I don't think so.

565
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,217
Makes sense.

566
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,054
That makes perfect sense,
because the Commander

567

00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,144
Well, actually, he's a sidekick.

632
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,704
Oh. Well, that makes sense.

633
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,249
Yeah.

634
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,411
Actually, they're all sidekicks.

635
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,825
Good for you, son.

636
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,864
Kid of your stature hangin'
out with a bunch of sidekicks.

637
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,831
As a freshman?
I didn't have the guts.

638
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,368
And I can only imagine
what your grandfather

639
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,928
would have said if I'd have
brought some of them home. [laughs]

640
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,868
You know, there's nothing wrong

641
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,876
- with being a sidekick, Dad.
- Oh, no.

642
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,639
Of course not.
I used to have one.

643
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,806
Saved my life once too.

644
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,715
Old... what's-his-name.

645
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,118
So then you would
be fine with...

646
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,588
...if I was a sidekick.

647
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,818
Well, yeah, sure, I guess.

648
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,589
Hey, hand me that mayonnaise there.

649
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,261
Well, that's good then,

650
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,027
because... because I am.

651
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,968
- Am what?
- A sidekick.

652
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:37,497
- Who is?
- Me, Dad.

653
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,601
Dad, I'm a sidekick, OK?

654
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,340
I washed out of Power Placement.

655
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,984
- Washed out!
- [Glasses rattling]

656
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,319
Boomer.

657
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,787
Couldn't make the big time,
so now he thinks

658
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,626
he can pass judgment on
some real heroes' kids, huh?

659
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,461
Oh, it's a power trip, Will.

660
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,797
That's all it is. Sonic Boom?

661
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,599
Try "Gym Teacher Man. "

662
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,162
No, Dad!
What are you doing?

663
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,107
I'm calling the school.
The tuition we pay them!

664
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,339
Dad, don't. Dad!

665
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,574
It's not Coach Boomer!

666
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,139
It's me, OK?
I don't have any powers.

667
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,114
But you never said...

668
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,591
I mean, you made it seem like...

669
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,185
Like I had super-strength
like you?

670
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,228
But I don't.

671
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,267
But you will, Will!

672
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,701
You're just...

673
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,069
You're just a late bloomer!
That's what it is!

674
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,472
Maybe. Maybe not.

675
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,944
But I don't care.

676
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,949
Because, really,
the fact of the matter is

677
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:56,316
I'm proud to be a sidekick.

678
00:35:56,387 --> 00:36:00,619
Actually, I'm proud
to be hero support.

679
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:09,557
Uh, so I, uh, think we pretty much
covered the undead.

680
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,465
What's next?

681
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,470
What?

682
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,977
"Your hero flies north
at 300 miles per hour for 15 minutes.

683
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,577
His archenemy is tunneling south
at 200 miles per hour for 10 minutes.

684
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,622
Assuming your hero
has X-ray vision,

685
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,317
how long before he realizes
he's going the wrong way?"

686
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,484
[Sighs]

687
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,757
All I ever wanted for him
was to save the world.

688
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,992
To just feel that once.

689
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,694
That's a lot to put on
a 14-year-old's shoulders.

690
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,464
Oh, come on, Josie!

691
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,472
When I was his age, I could
put a truck on my shoulders.

692
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,233
Oh!

693
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,777
Honey, I know
you're disappointed.

694
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,677
So am I. You think I didn't
want to see my son fly?

695
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,874
- Or have super-strength?
- Or fly?

696
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,350
But we can't change who he is.

697
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,910
Not without dropping him
in a vat of toxic waste.

698
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,618
- Steve!
- Aw... Oh, no, no...

699
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,592
Where would we even find a vat of...

700
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,185
- Steve!
- I-I just, I'm thinking.

701
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,355
Will is a great kid.

702
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,093
This is not the end
of the world. OK.

703
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,567
So maybe we won't be
the Stronghold Three,

704
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:22,402
the greatest family of superheroes
the world has ever known.

705
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,703
But we will be
the Stronghold Three,

706
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:28,040
the greatest family
the world has ever known.

707
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,443
You're right.

708
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,209
You're right, and he can
always go into real estate!

709
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,946
Welcome to Sky Hi...

710
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,080
[Lash] Come on, Ron.

711
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,057
Hey, big boy.
Where's your hat?

712
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,457
Hey, where's your hat?

713
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:46,291
If you're not gonna respect me,
at least respect the hat!

714
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,197
- Oh, pfff!
- Guys. Guys, come on.

715
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,531
Give Ron his hat back.

716
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,661
All right.
You're the sidekick.

717
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,433
Give him his hat back.

718
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,980
[Speed] We'll catch you later,
Stronghold. [laughing]

719
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,571
Hey, race you up the steps.

720
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,583
Thanks, Will.

721
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:07,879
Sure, Ron.

722
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,982
- [Layla] Over here!
- Saved you a seat!

723
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,616
Hey, and I saved you a pudding!

724
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:21,022
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, buddy. Check this out.

725
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,794
Whoa!

726
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,972
- Uh... sorry.
- You will be.

727
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,136
Let's not do this.

728
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:37,578
You think you can do whatever
you want 'cause your name's Stronghold?

729
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,809
I'm sorry my dad
put your dad in jail, but...

730
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,648
Nobody talks about my father.

731
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,318
Ah!

732
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,748
Oh, it is so on!

00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,495
- [Kids chanting] Fight, fight, fight!
- Mr. Boy, do something!

Where are your sidekicks,
sidekick?

745
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,717
[Zach] Right here!

746
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,383
Yeah.

[Grunts]

748
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,233
Leave them alone!

He's strong!

750
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:12,767
I'm strong?

751
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:14,640
He's super-strong.

[Cheering]

753
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,313
Yeah, Will!

754
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,188
Now, who tripped me?

755
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,620
Stronghold!

756
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,903
What if I said it's not just her twin?
It's her evil twin.

757
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:54,547
- This Friday, you say?
- Medulla, you dog!

[Screaming]

760

Think I can't take a hit?

[Yelling]

762
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,130
Will!

Will! Pull the pin!

00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,369
He's comin', man!

765
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,550
Hi.

00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,092
<i>[Beeping]</i>

767
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,296
I didn't do anything, though.
He started it.

768
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,563
Your dad started it,
and I'm gonna finish it.

769
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,867
- [Clicking]
- [Powers] Don't bother.

The Detention Room neutralizes
all super-powers. Sit.

771
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,946
Now, here at Sky High
we do everything we can

772
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,915
to teach you how
to use your powers.

773
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,316
But what you do with them,
now that's up to you.

774
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:06,220
Living up to your father's reputation
or trying to live it down

775
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,317
is a sad waste of talent.
Your talent.

776
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:16,128
Try to keep that in mind the next time
you're about to do something stupid.

777
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,537
[Exhales] All right, look.

778
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:28,635
Whatever happened with our dads,
it has nothing to do with us.

779
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,078
What do you say?

780
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,114
I say

781
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,778
if you ever cross me again,
I'll roast you alive.

[Josie] So, Will, anything
interesting happen at school today?

784
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,078
Uh...

785
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:06,242
Well, as you may have noticed,
I got my powers today!

00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,949
Yes, we know.
The principal called.

787
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,285
OK. Look, it's not...

788
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,018
It's not as bad as it sounds.

789
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:19,426
- It's a really funny, great story.
- You nearly destroyed the cafeteria.

790
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:22,954
Yeah, but, Mom...
I got my powers!

791
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,024
And do you know
how to use them wisely?

792
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,767
Sanctum. Now.

793
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:35,978
William Theodore Stronghold...

794
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,581
...come here!

795
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,277
You're not mad?

796
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:44,412
My boy has super-strength!
How can I be mad?

797
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,978
- [Cracking]
- Ow!

798
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,388
I'm sorry. [cracking] Ow!

799
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,892
- You are strong!
- Yeah.

800
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,021
If your mom asks, you tell her
I read you the riot act, and...

801
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,328
...I took away your Xbox.

802
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,563
- But I don't have an Xbox.
- Are you sure?

803
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,832
- Oh! Go ahead.
- When did you...?

804
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,133
- What?
- Open it up!

805
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,606
Here. Here, I'll get it.

806
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:05,903
All right. Let's see.

807
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,240
[Male voice] The boy
has Stronghold's power.

808
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,872
- It's almost poetic.
- We should crush them now.

809
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,916
- We know he has the weapon.
- Patience!

810
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,917
We have waited this long.

811
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,476
When the time is right,
we'll have our revenge.

812
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:20,990
You know, time would move
a lot faster if we had an Xbox.

813
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:22,491
Ah! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

814
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,424
- Dude, you made sidekick history!
- Aw. I don't know about that.

815
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:26,289
- Dude, you made sidekick history!
- Aw. I don't know about that.

816
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:30,197
No, seriously. From now on,
people mess with us at their own peril.

817
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:34,226
You're breaking down barriers,
proving we're not heroes and sidekicks.

818
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,101
- We're just people.
- Super people.

819
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,370
- [Bell rings]
- Seats, please.

820
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:44,847
We have a lot to cover this morning,
starting with motorcycle sidecar basics.

821
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,679
Uh, except for you,
Mr. Stronghold.

822
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,242
Would you gather your gear
and come up here, please?

823
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,550
I've got your new class schedule.

824
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:58,958
Congratulations. You've been
transferred to the Hero class.

825
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,863
Oh, and by the way, if you should
find yourself needing any hero support,

826
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,733
I still do a little freelance. Ha!

827
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,433
Ha!

828
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,637
But what about them?

829
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,044
- We'll see you on the bus.
- We'll hang at lunch.

830
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,742
Right after you've dunked
Ethan's head in the toilet.

831
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:24,186
[Sighs] Well, you best not be late.

832
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,260
Just go already.

833
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,066
Rays!

834
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,107
From the silliness
of the shrink ray

835
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,404
to the devastation
of the death ray.

836
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,878
These are the very
foundations of Mad Science.

837
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,778
[Knocking]

838
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,942
Yes? They told me
you were coming.

839
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:57,612
Unfortunately, all the
lab partners are taken.

840
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,885
I suppose I could pair you
with my teaching assistant.

841
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:04,293
Miss Grayson?
My apologies.

842

843

[Medulla] Come on.

844
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,229
Come on! Quickly,
quickly, quickly.

845

Feet! You stepped on my foot!

846
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,398
OK, how's that?

847
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,339
Perfect... if you're building
a heat ray.

848
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:21,502
You're supposed to be
building a freeze ray.

849
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,512
OK, I have no idea
what I'm doing.

850
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,013
Dreadful technique.

851
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:28,245
You've confused rays
with beams! D!

852
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,946
Minus! I'd give you an F,

853
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:34,218
but that would only mean having
to see you in summer school.

854
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,657
- And what have we here?
- Uh...

855
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,696
Well, I don't know.
I didn't do it.

856
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:42,493
You're far too modest,
Mr. Stronghold.

857
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:48,168
Or perhaps
not modest enough.

858
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:50,433
Miss Grayson,
in the future,

859
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:53,670
please allow the students
to succeed, or fail,

860
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,905
on their own.

861
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:00,872
How did you do that?

862
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:01,940
I'm a Technopath.

863
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,579
I can control technology
with my mind.

864
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,523
Wow. All I can do
is punch stuff.

865
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,152
Yet he'll be the one
on cereal boxes.

866
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:13,594
Show me the justice in that.

867
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,428
Miss Fernandez,
kindly thaw out Mr. Hellman.

868
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,469
- That was amazing.
- So is what you did in the cafeteria.

869
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,629
Yeah. Once they start
handing out grades

870
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:24,902
for destruction of school property,
I'll be in good shape.

871
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:28,342
You know, I can totally help you out
with all this science stuff.

872
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,471
[Stammering] Yeah, you'd do that?

873
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:31,775
Mm-hmm.

874
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,114
I could be, like, your...
private tutor.

875
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,551
Cool.

876

00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,919
Will? Sitting with Gwen Grayson?

Gotta give him that.

Sorry. All full.

That's OK.

00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,465
Uh, I think I see
an empty table over there.

No offense, Will.

00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,649
I'm sorry.

Sometimes you
have to act nice...

Watch it, Stronghold. That big mouth
is gonna get you in trouble.

If Will beats you in Save the Citizen,
lay off sidekicks for the year.

And if he loses, you can dunk Ethan
in the toilet every day till graduation.

It was driving him crazy.
So finally I took mercy on him

- Great.
- So why don't you tell him?

1074
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:47,950
Well, I was gonna
ask him to homecoming,

1075

but there's two problems.

Hmm. You know what I think?

He's going to homecoming with me.

1256

He threw a party
and didn't invite you.

1257
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:41,770
You're just embarrassing him.
You're just embarrassing yourself.

1258
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,369
OK. I understand.

1259
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:49,112
And, um, when you see Will again,

1260
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,881
can you tell him that I never
want to talk to him again?

1261
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:55,382
- I'll give him the message.
- Layla.

You two deserve each other.

- Oh, thanks, Will.

- Nothing.

I mean, I just told her the truth.

1268

You're a hero, she's a sidekick.
She was holding you back.

Why would you do that? Layla's been
my best friend since first grade.

1271

You've got new friends now, and I
think that you need to figure out

whether you want to hang with us
or with those losers.

- No, forget it.

I'm not going anywhere with you,
not now or not to homecoming.

yourself a new date, Gwen.

Not the night before the dance!

we'd go to the dance!

that promise is kept!

Come in after you! Got it!

1406
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,556
I was gonna say go get help.

1407
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,525
Go get help. Got it!
Now get in there!

1408
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:02,960
Sorry!

- [Zach] Hey, Warren, how 'bout a torch?

1410
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:09,063
[Warren] Only if you want
to get barbecued.

- Is Royal Pain's daughter.
- Yeah, and she...

1418
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:44,300
- Stole the Pacifier.
- Right.

1419
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:47,569
She turned everybody into babies,
including your parents.

1420
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:49,200
OK. That I didn't know.

1421
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:52,440
This is even more than the great
Will Stronghold can handle.

1422
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,573
She's right.
It's gonna take all of us.

1423
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:57,015
All of who?
You and Warren?

1424
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:58,814
The rest of us are only sidekicks.

1425
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:01,879
Just because you have powers,
that doesn't make you a hero.

1426
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:04,187
Sometimes it just makes you a jerk.

1427
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:06,591
Makes me a jerk.

1428
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:10,222
- I guess what I'm trying to say is...
- We get it. You've been a jerk.

Layla,

ends up killing me tonight,

I just want you to know...

[Penny] Isn't that sweet?

1433

- I hate sweet!

You guys are a part of this too?

1435
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:30,574
- Why am I not surprised?
- Go take care of Gwen.

1436
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:32,847
- We'll handle these clowns.
- [Chuckles]

- Pinch what? Restraint A or B?

1443
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:03,409
Now you just calm down.
Let's go back to one.

[Penny] Come on, sidekick!
You gonna fight back?

1447

I don't believe in using
powers for violence.

I don't believe you
even have any powers!

Go, Penny! Beat Layla!
Go, Penny! Beat Layla!

Cootchie-cootchie-coo!

1457
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:05,307
I take you back,
my dear Commander,

1458
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,314
to your senior year at Sky High,

1459
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:10,351
a time before anyone knew
what a Technopath was.

1460
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:14,252
So a brilliant but misunderstood
girl named Sue Tenny

1461
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:18,952
was written off as a science geek
and stuck in Sidekick class.

1462
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:22,986
She hatched a plan,
so daring, so visionary,

1463
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:25,999
to start her very own
Supervillain Academy

1464
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:30,163
and raise a generation of heroes
from scratch as villains.

1465
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:33,503
But first she had to destroy
the very institution

1466
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:36,874
that dared to spurn her genius!

1467
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:42,042
And now, so many years later,
that plan is complete.

1468
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:44,017
My only regret:

1469
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:48,613
That this may be the finest
supervillain speech ever given,

1470
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,488
and you don't even know
what I'm saying.

1471
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:53,720
[Will] But I do.

1472
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:58,164
Look. I'm sorry that my parents
destroyed your mom.

1473
01:23:58,233 --> 01:24:01,634
Now put my dad down.

1474
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,068
[Cooing]

1475
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:06,164
No one could defeat Royal Pain.

1476
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:08,766
When the Pacifier exploded,
I wasn't destroyed.

1477
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:11,676
I was merely
turned into a baby.

1478
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:14,408
Stitches took me away
and raised me as his daughter.

1479
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:17,349
Daddy's little girl.
[Laughing]

1480
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:20,911
- I told you never to call me that!
- [Whimpers]

1481
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:22,752
Lunatic!

[Sighs] That's right.

1483
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:29,120
Royal Pain wasn't my mother.
Royal Pain is me!

1484
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,324
Oh, my God.

1485
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,261
I made out with an old lady.

1486
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:40,769
[Grunting]

1487
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:52,151
Yoo-hoo! Right here!

1488

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Way to go, Popsicle.

1490
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:42,959
Hmm!

1491
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:45,599
Big mistake.

you were a sidekick!

01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:08,061
I am a sidekick.

1495
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:09,596
Don't leave us here to die!

1496
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,394
Royal Pain sabotaged
the antigravity device!

1497
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:14,867
The whole school's
gonna fall out of the sky!

1498

We only have 10 minutes!

1499
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:19,339
Here's the antigravity room.

1500
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:21,432
Didn't Royal Pain
seal off every route?

1501
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,204
- What about this conduit?
- Right.

1502
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:26,076
You'd have to be like
a rat to fit in there.

1503
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,176
Oh, great.

1504

OK. OK, you're doin' great, Magenta.
Looks great.

Look at those cute little legs.
OK, go about 10 feet.

1507
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:46,226
Yeah, there should be
a opening on your right.

1508
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:48,565
- [Magenta] Gotcha!
- Find the access panel.

1509
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,036
- What?
- It leads to the generator.

1510
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:52,402
[Magenta] I'm on it!

We'll see about that!

- Huh?
- [Will] Surprised?

- Honey, you can't blame yourself.
- 'Course not.

1562
01:30:50,378 --> 01:30:53,677
How were you supposed to know
your girlfriend was a psychopath?

1563
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:56,273
No, that's not it. Um,

1564
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:59,547
you gave me one rule,
and I broke it.

1565
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:02,987
I took her into the sanctum,
and that's how she got the Pacifier.

1566
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:07,153
- The whole party was a trap.
- And so was the homecoming, Will.

1567
01:31:07,228 --> 01:31:11,858
We all fell into Royal Pain's trap,
but you defeated her.

1568
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:15,334
You saved Sky High,
and everyone in her.

1569
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:20,272
- I didn't do it by myself.
- Excuse me. Steve? Josie?

1570
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:23,276
Even though it appears Gwen
only came up with this award

1571
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:27,007
as a way to lure you to the dance
and your ultimate doom,

1572
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:28,981
still it's inscribed, so...

1573
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:33,009
I'd be honored to accept
this "Hero of the Year" award.

1574
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:38,184
But I'm afraid this
doesn't belong to us.

1575
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:40,352
[Josie] It belongs to them.

1576
01:31:40,428 --> 01:31:43,226
The sidekicks.

1577
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:44,662
I mean, hero support.

1578
01:31:44,732 --> 01:31:48,259
Why don't we just call them
what they really are, Josie?

1579
01:31:49,437 --> 01:31:51,268
Heroes.

1580
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:58,678
Oh, and, Jonathan?

1581
01:31:58,746 --> 01:32:01,408
Whatever you're teaching them,

1582
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:03,814
keep teaching them it.

1583
01:32:03,885 --> 01:32:05,580
Sure.

1584
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:18,295
[Powers] What a waste.

1585
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:21,267
I can't do anything more
to help you.

1586
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:24,327
I'm not Wonder Woman, you know.

1587
01:32:25,339 --> 01:32:29,298
I went through puberty twice...
for this?

1588
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:32,039
I have de-Pacified all the babies

1589
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:35,549
and destroyed
that horrible weapon forever.

1590
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:38,782
Let's boogie!

Melt with You]</i>

1592
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:53,196
This is so sweet,
I could hurl.

1593
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:55,633
Tell me about it.

1594
01:32:55,703 --> 01:32:57,534
- Do you wanna dance?
- [Zach] Yes!

1595
01:32:57,605 --> 01:33:00,039
I mean, yeah. Yeah.

1596
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:31,533
<i>[Will] Compared to homecoming,
the rest of the year was pretty boring. </i>

1597

got what they deserved. </i>

1598

<i>But now nobody wants
to save the citizen. </i>

01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:37,038
Uncle! Uncle!

1600
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:38,601
<i>Relax. I'm just kidding. </i>

1601
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:41,614
<i>But they are getting to spend
a lot of quality time together. </i>

1602

<i>Oh, yeah, and Ron Wilson, bus driver,
fell into a vat of toxic waste. </i>

1603
