<i>The history of
man is defined by war.</i>

3
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,127
<i>And war by
the men who fight it.</i>

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,125
<i>What if we could
create a better man?</i>

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,245
<i>Someone did.</i>

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,200
<i>The Agent Program was
initiated in August of 1967,</i>

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,011
<i>by a man named
Peter Aaron Litvenko.</i>

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,487
<i>Its purpose was to create
the perfect killing machine.</i>

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,608
<i>Human beings without
emotion or fear or remorse.</i>

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,922
<i>The resulting subjects
were called Agents.</i>

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,001
<i>The program was a success.</i>

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,447
<i>But the price of
creating men without</i>

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,801
<i>humanity was
Litvenko's conscience.</i>

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,764
<i>Applying his brilliant mind to his flight,
he vanished.</i>

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,604
<i>Fearing that it
would be exposed,</i>

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,330
<i>the government
shut down the program.</i>

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,962
<i>And surviving Agents
drifted into shadows.</i>

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,243
<i>Realizing its potential,
many tried to restart the program.</i>

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,523
<i>All failed.</i>

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,684
<i>So they focused their efforts
on finding the one man who could.</i>

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>The task fell to Dr. Albert Delriego.</i>

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,842
<i>A ruthless and efficient man.</i>

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,841
<i>But Litvenko had disappeared,
and even he couldn't find him.</i>

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,809
<i>Then,
six years into his search,</i>

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,003
<i>Delriego made
an unexpected discovery.</i>

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,127
<i>A single photograph,
which would</i>

27
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,561
<i>become the key to
finding Litvenko.</i>

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,685
<i>No one had ever imagined that,
in the end,</i>

29
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,041
<i>it would come down
to one little girl.</i>

30
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,924
Sir,
we have a match in Germany.

31
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,960
Checking surveillance
databases now, sir.

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,280
Secure
the files and evacuate.

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,445
Sir, we need to leave now.

34
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,321
What the hell is happening?

35
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,521
I don't know, sir.

36
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,809
I want to know who's doing this.
I need answers.

37
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,687
Give me an update.

38
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,643
I said, give me an update!

39
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,321
I said, status!

40
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,123
I suppose
I should be flattered.

41
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,208
I didn't think I
merited a contract.

42
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,486
You don't.

43
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,887
You know,
I hunted an Agent once.

44
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,251
Took four weeks.

45
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,170
Most rewarding
catch of my career.

46
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,566
Your employers are attempting
to restart the Agent Program.

47
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,002
And you are here to stop them?

48
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,210
You are too late.

49
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,047
We already have Litvenko.

50
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,364
He's currently working
on next generation units.

51
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,763
He's not.
Because you haven't found him.

52
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,243
Where is Katia van Dees?

53
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,442
I have a chip implanted here.

54
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,285
If my heart stops beating,

55
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,444
my security detail will
come through the door.

56
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,486
You need me.

57
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,961
No. I only need pieces of you.

58
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,290
The information I require
is in two places.

59
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,885
Your secure database,

60
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,963
and inside your head.

61
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,886
Berlin,
they found her in Berlin.

62
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,291
That's all I know.

63
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,161
Okay, Okay.

64
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,646
File 5-1-7,
access code G21-12-57.

65
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,007
Thank you.

66
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,322
But you won't find her.
She's a ghost.

67
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,970
I will.

68
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Yes?

69
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,322
<i>Delriego is dead.</i>

70
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,801
What happened?

71
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,610
<i>We think it may
have been an Agent.</i>

72
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,085
Delriego was close
to finding the girl.

73
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,802
Get her before he does.

74
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,442
He would have lived in Berlin
between 1989 and 1990.

75
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,967
There must be taxes paid
or rental records or something.

76
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,850
I don't have a name.

77
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,405
Look, he would've
been 49, 50, um...

78
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,201
Blond-haired, 174 centimeters,
75 kilograms.

79
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,526
He's like this.

80
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm sorry.

81
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,004
Without a name or an address,

82
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,524
there's nothing
I can do for you.

83
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,011
If he is missing,

84
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,162
may I suggest
you try the police?

85
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,402
The police won't help me.
Why do you think I'm here?

86
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,411
And all you're doing is telling me
what you cannot do.

87
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,681
You have to realize

88
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,047
that millions of people
have lived in Berlin

89
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,089
over the past 25 years.

90
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,887
I can't be expected
to sort through every

91
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,367
one of them for your
mystery man, can I?

92
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,005
It's 19,467,000.

93
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,085
62.2% Slavic origin,
49.2% male.

94
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,682
1.2% between
the ages of 49 to 50.

95
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,127
That's 71,291.

96
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,760
That's something, isn't it?

97
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,289
There's nothing I can do
to help you, miss.

98
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,126
Okay.

99
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,725
Who is he?

100
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,563
This man you have to find.

101
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,649
Who is he to you?

102
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,970
I don't know.

103
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,800
To or from?

104
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,043
<i>Everybody who comes
in here is running.</i>

105
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,329
Either to
something or from it.

106
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,411
I see a lot like you. Runners.

107
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,484
They come to me thinking
a new passport means a new life.

108
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,366
This is no good.

109
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,200
It's perfect.
The data strip's been demagnetized.

110
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,169
The only place this gets me
is a holding cell.

111
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,520
You want better, you pay more.

112
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,487
Or I put word out that Tobias
sells bad paper.

113
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,928
Be careful, little girl.

114
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,441
This world is
a dangerous place.

115
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,449
<i>47, it's Diana. You have company.</i>

116
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,561
Who is he?

117
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,681
<i>A Syndicate asset.</i>

118
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,240
<i>Name, unknown.</i>

119
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,681
<i>Technical capacities, unknown.</i>

120
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,887
He found her.

121
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,087
<i>Means he's good.</i>

122
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
You're better.

123
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,168
<i>I'm sure you can handle him.</i>

124
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,081
You have 48 hours
to terminate both targets.

125
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,247
Sorry.

126
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,807
You do know that stealing is a crime,
don't you, Katia?

127
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,568
That is your name, isn't it?
Katia van Dees?

128
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,644
My German's not...
Are you some kind of cop?

129
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,968
No.
How do you know my name?

130
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,407
I'm John. John Smith.

131
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,966
I'd like to buy
you a cup of coffee.

132
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,121
I'm not interested.

133
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,003
How about in living?

134
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,211
Are you interested in that?

135
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,968
Walk away or I'll scream.

136
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,651
He won't care.

137
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,164
<i>He's here to kill you, Katia.</i>

138
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,246
And I'm here to stop him.

139
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,489
I know you don't have any reason
to trust me but look at him.

140
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,766
Look at how he moves.

141
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,041
Look at
the shadows under his coat.

142
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,282
Look at his eyes
and tell me that I'm lying.

143
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,925
Why would anyone
want to kill me?

144
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,127
For the same
reason you're trying to

145
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,440
look for someone
you can't find.

146
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,848
The man I'm looking for,
do you know where he is?

147
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,161
No, but you do.

148
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,000
What do I have to do?

149
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,003
There's a maintenance door,
the north end of the track, one level down.

150
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,606
<i>It's been unlocked for us.
We're gonna head there now.</i>

151
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,205
<i>Go through the corridor
up the stairs to the back alley.</i>

152
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,925
There'll be a car
waiting for us there.

153
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,006
Run!

154
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,401
Move.

155
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,605
Franco, we're coming your way.

156
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,089
Hurry! Hurry!

157
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,041
Where's the Agent?

158
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,884
He's right behind us!
Move! Move! Move!

159
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,561
Katia, are you hit?

160
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,051
Who the fuck are you people?

161
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,123
Calm down, Katia! You're safe.

162
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,244
We've been sent to protect...

163
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,926
I work for a corporation
called Syndicate International,

164
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,366
and I'm here to protect you.

165
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,891
From who?

166
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,565
His name is 47,
and he's an Agent.

167
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,411
And right now the only thing
standing between you and him, is me.

168
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,927
If you don't do everything I say,
everything,

169
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,206
he will kill you.

170
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
Let's go!

171
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,764
We'll be safe here.

172
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,131
Can I see some ID, please?

173
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,487
Bags out and open, please.

174
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,165
Drop your weapon!

175
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,163
On the ground!
Hands where I can seem 'em!

176
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,120
- Don't move!
- Get them cuffed!

177
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,003
Come on with me. Let's go.
Grab that bag.

178
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,921
Let's go!

179
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,328
Miss van Dees, is it?

180
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,640
You mind telling
me why you're here?

181
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,801
'Cause your friend in there
wouldn't talk.

182
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,526
He's not my friend.
I don't know who he is.

183
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,044
All right.
Maybe we can start with

184
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,567
why he discharged a firearm
in front of my embassy.

185
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,609
Someone's trying...

186
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,569
I think someone's
trying to kill me.

187
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,848
John was trying to help me.

188
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,448
Does this someone have a name?

189
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,842
Is something wrong,
Miss van Dees?

190
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,446
Miss van Dees!

191
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,641
He's coming.

192
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,081
Shit.

193
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,841
Freeze!

194
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,206
Hands in the air!

195
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,241
Sanders.

196
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,924
Blaser R93 LRS2.

197
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,329
Custom configured
right-hand twist.

198
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,727
4-24x50 sniper scope, and...

199
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,241
...hair trigger.

200
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,441
Very nice.

201
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,720
Come here.

202
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,089
<i>Almost as nice
as the twin .45s,</i>

203
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,881
<i>and these very special knives
you walked in here with.</i>

204
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,049
<i>You like riddles?</i>

205
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,681
<i>Yeah, me neither.</i>

206
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,369
I hate 'em, actually.

207
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,888
<i>But you, my friend,
are a riddle to me.</i>

208
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,684
<i>'Cause I've run your
face and your prints</i>

209
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,450
<i>through every database we have.</i>

210
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,285
And you know what we found?

211
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,321
Nothing.

212
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,680
So

213
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,924
<i>why don't we
start with your name?</i>

214
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,530
47.

215
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,721
That's not a name.

216
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,004
No, but it is mine.

217
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,771
Okay.

218
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,601
All right, Mr. 47.

219
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,410
What exactly are you?

220
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,120
An assassin.

221
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,411
An assassin. Okay.

222
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,490
You're here to
kill who exactly?

223
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,765
You have a girl here.

224
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,644
I don't know what
you're talking about.

225
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,243
Do you love your family?

226
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,601
My family?

227
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,921
Yes, your wife,

228
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,203
your two small children.

229
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,920
Do you love them?

230
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,128
We're not talking about me,
we're talking about you.

231
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,444
No, we're talking about life.

232
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,085
And death.

233
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,084
Do you love them?

234
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,246
All right.

235
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,771
Maybe we should
just start over.

236
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,888
I believe you do.

237
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,328
That's why you
should let me go.

238
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,047
You listen to me
very carefully, Mr. 47,

239
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,601
or whatever
the fuck your name is.

240
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,450
There's a lot of
ways this thing can end,

241
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,005
and that is
entirely up to you.

242
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,885
But you can be goddamn certain that
this thing is not gonna end

243
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,411
the way that you
thought it was.

244
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,210
'Cause the last
time I checked,

245
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,560
you're locked in here with me,

246
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,481
and I'm the one with the gun.

247
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,604
No, Mr. Sanders.

248
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,766
You are locked
in here with me,

249
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,651
and you just brought me mine.

250
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,840
Do you love your children
enough to die for them?

251
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,321
Freeze!

252
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,922
Let's go.
Let me help you.

253
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,165
<i>Two suspects,
one male, one female,</i>

254
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,727
<i>have broken out of
Interrogation Rooms 1 and 2.</i>

255
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,570
<i>They are armed and dangerous.
Proceed with caution.</i>

256
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,007
Sergeant.

257
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,569
Is everything all right, sir?

258
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,086
Sir?

259
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,805
Hurry! Hurry!

260
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,847
Get out!

261
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,161
Move!

262
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,804
You want to tell me
what's happening now?

263
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,089
What the fuck is happening?

264
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,530
The man you're looking for,
his name is Peter Aaron Litvenko.

265
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,841
Who is he?

266
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,846
Your father.

267
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,205
<i>Tell me about him.</i>

268
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,091
I don't know much.

269
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,528
Only that he's a geneticist,
an expert in human biogenetics

270
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,921
who spearheaded
a program of experimentation.

271
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,524
What kind of experiments?

272
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,843
The kind that created killers.

273
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,524
<i>They engineered human beings
by targeting and enhancing specific genes.</i>

274
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,921
The resulting subjects
were stronger, faster,

275
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,724
more intelligent
than normal people.

276
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,487
They programmed
out pain, fear.

277
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,085
<i>Even love.</i>

278
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,969
<i>They were called Agents.</i>

279
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,926
And your father was one of
the program's lead scientists.

280
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,329
You're not serious.

281
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,602
<i>What does any of
this have to do with me?</i>

282
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,086
<i>Why do they want to kill me?</i>

283
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,527
Kryton Technologies has restarted
the Agent Program.

284
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,085
<i>They're building
Agents right now.</i>

285
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,322
<i>Like 47, maybe worse.</i>

286
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,841
They believe that you're the key
to finding your father.

287
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,451
<i>I don't understand.</i>

288
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,886
<i>Your father
knows their weakness.</i>

289
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,883
He knows how to stop them.

290
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,087
Katia!

291
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,080
Are you okay?

292
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,486
No.

293
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,683
Is your name
really John Smith?

294
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,602
It's Brian.

295
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,841
Well, at least you didn't say
it was Agent 46.

296
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,286
No, that's someone else.

297
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,291
Come here. Let me help you.

298
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,002
You're gonna be all right.

299
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,081
Will I?

300
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,369
I'm sorry.

301
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,646
For what?

302
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,322
For having to tell you
who your father is.

303
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,369
Well, you told me the truth.

304
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,371
That's more than anyone's
ever done for me.

305
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,525
Why do they think I
can find him, John?

306
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,001
It doesn't matter now.

307
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,161
It does.

308
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,408
Tell me what you know.

309
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,683
I know that you're in danger.

310
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,887
The best thing
you can do right now is hide.

311
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,281
I've been hiding
my entire life.

312
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,640
Please, tell me what you know.

313
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,848
I'm authorized to
protect you, Katia,

314
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,520
not find your father.

315
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Don't do this.

316
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,211
I have to.

317
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,807
Okay.

318
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,807
When we were researching your father,
we found a file.

319
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,284
It mentioned you.
It said that...

320
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,280
Said What?

321
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,410
It said that he changed you.

322
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,811
Changed me how?

323
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,964
It said that he had enhanced
your survival skills.

324
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,883
It's why we think
you've been hiding.

325
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,088
It's why we think you've been
able to keep off the radar.

326
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,640
It's why we think you've been able
to stay alive for so long.

327
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,685
That's why I'm always afraid.

328
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,245
Yes.

329
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,561
Jesus!

330
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,969
They think I know how
to find my father.

331
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,921
What is this?

332
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,764
It's my father's life.

333
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,764
What else do you
know about him?

334
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,285
Just what I've told you.

335
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,761
You must have
something. How old is he?

336
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,160
72.

337
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,765
Where was he born?

338
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,126
Ukraine.

339
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,366
Medical conditions?

340
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,047
He was diagnosed with
rheumatoid arthritis in his 40s.

341
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,771
Somewhere warm, then.

342
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,281
What else?

343
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,606
Lung cancer.

344
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,804
Our last confirmed sighting was a hospital
in Seoul, South Korea in 2011.

345
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,288
He was engaged
with some clinical trials

346
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,802
for something called
nanoparticle inhalation therapy.

347
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,960
He was Stage III then.

348
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,802
So, uh,
travel would be difficult.

349
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,644
Does he have money?

350
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,811
We think so.

351
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,165
Somewhere warm with advanced
medical facilities.

352
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,004
A city.

353
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,400
Hobbies?

354
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,845
What did he love to do?

355
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,207
Orchids.

356
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,048
He was an expert on orchids.

357
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,162
What languages
did he speak, John?

358
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,526
Uh, English,
Russian, Mandarin and Tamil.

359
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,080
Why Tamil?

360
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,250
Because your mother
was from Sri Lanka.

361
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,240
You know where he is, don't you?

362
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,041
Katia.

363
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,086
You told me you
wanted to do this,

364
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,520
and I told you
I'd do it with you.

365
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,564
But if you want my help,
you have to tell me where he is.

366
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,083
<i>We've lost the girl.</i>

367
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,083
I thought you told me that
your John Smith would be adequate.

368
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,280
<i>We underestimated this Agent.</i>

369
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,127
Find Litvenko,
whatever it takes.

370
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,285
And Garad,

371
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,650
better the girl dead than this Agent
finding Litvenko before we do.

372
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,161
Katia.

373
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,801
Katia.

374
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,201
Do you know why
you're still alive?

375
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,487
Because I chose
not to kill you.

376
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,246
But they will.

377
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,680
After they use you
to find your father.

378
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,003
What do you know
about my father?

379
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,685
As much as you do.

380
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,560
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

381
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,491
<i>No!</i>

382
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,004
Time to make a choice, Katia.

383
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,246
Them or me.

384
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,890
Why should I trust you?

385
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,681
You don't have to.
Just trust your memories.

386
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,009
Take my hand.

387
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,846
Do you remember the day
you ran away, Katia?

388
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,960
<i>Peter, we have to go!</i>

389
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,249
Your father's lab?
The car rides?

390
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,441
<i>It's okay.</i>

391
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,520
The last time you saw

392
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,561
your mother?

393
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,081
<i>No! No, no, no!</i>

394
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,967
You were there.

395
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,767
<i>Yes.</i>

396
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,880
<i>We were part of
the same program.</i>

397
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,562
<i>We need to go.
Quick!</i>

398
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,601
<i>Run! Quick!</i>

399
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,004
<i>Now, get down.
Get down, please!</i>

400
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,080
<i>Papa!</i>

401
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,010
<i>You will live.</i>

402
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,481
He left me. Why?

403
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,524
Find him.
You can ask him yourself.

404
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,241
Untie me.

405
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,764
You have a lot
to learn, Katia.

406
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,604
We don't have a lot of time.

407
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,091
Untie yourself.

408
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,365
That took you too long.

409
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,010
I didn't
know that was a test.

410
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,685
Everything is a test.

411
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,207
Keep taking these,
you'll fail.

412
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,766
Hey, I need those.

413
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,729
What you need is a clear head.

414
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,684
Stop fighting what you are.

415
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,046
And what am I?

416
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,850
Keep asking questions,
probably dead.

417
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,610
What am I?

418
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,521
You're the same
as me, only better.

419
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,922
Bullshit!
I'm just Katia van Dees.

420
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,520
You speak French, Spanish, Mandarin.
Where did you learn them?

421
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,523
How did you free
yourself from the rope?

422
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,043
You've been programmed.

423
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,725
And your name
isn't Katia van Dees.

424
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,770
It's <i>"Quatre-vingt-dix."</i>
French for "90."

425
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,561
So I'm 43
versions better than you?

426
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,641
Do they know?

427
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,563
If they knew,
you'd be the target.

428
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,721
Come on, let's go.

429
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,128
If you need my help
to find my father,

430
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,442
why did you shoot me?

431
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,764
I didn't shoot you,
I marked you.

432
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,480
There are so many.

433
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,920
If I shoot one,
the rest will converge.

434
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,684
So what do we do, Katia?

435
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,761
Avoid them.

436
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,767
No. Suppress your fear,
face the threat.

437
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,171
Your father programmed you

438
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,489
to see and hear everything
at extremely heightened levels.

439
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,083
You process that information
to anticipate the threat.

440
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,131
So, anticipate it.

441
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,845
Katia.

442
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,645
There.

443
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,600
<i>Area Four, all...</i>

444
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,046
Katia.

445
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,447
Now.

446
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,850
I need you to step out there.

447
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,126
Why?

448
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,046
To draw them toward you.

449
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,845
They're going to shoot me!

450
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,530
They're not gonna shoot you.

451
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,689
Do you want to see
your father again?

452
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,044
Trust me.

453
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,440
<i>I have a visual target, locked.</i>

454
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,607
Moving in.

455
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,321
Hello, Katia.

456
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,564
I'm only going
to ask you once.

457
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,131
Where is your father?

458
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,924
I want you to know,
I'm a big fan of your work, 47.

459
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,242
It's an honor
to meet a legend.

460
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,411
I thought you could only be
a legend after you were dead.

461
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,409
Oh, but you are.

462
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,523
You just don't know it yet.

463
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,967
I feel pretty good
for a dead man, John.

464
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,485
Almost as good as you.

465
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,641
Yeah?

466
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,483
Well,
the thing is, I'm special.

467
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,127
Let's see.

468
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,120
Pretty crazy, huh?

469
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,651
I'm better. Say it.

470
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,530
Say it!

471
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,005
You're not.

472
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
You missed.

473
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,371
No, she didn't.

474
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,365
<i>He made a mistake.</i>

475
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,965
<i>He had a gun
at your head.</i>

476
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,207
And he didn't pull
the trigger.

477
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,805
He wanted me to know
he'd beaten me.

478
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,485
What the fuck was he?

479
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,927
People don't just walk away
from four bullets.

480
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,201
They just don't.

481
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,124
Subdermal titanium body armor.

482
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,362
It's injected into the skin
in liquid form.

483
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,648
It's flexible
and extremely strong.

484
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,481
He had his nervous system
heightened. Wired for speed.

485
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,931
I've heard of these
Syndicate experiments...

486
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,805
but if they can do this
with him...

487
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,123
Now will you tell me
where Litvenko is?

488
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,087
Swear to me that
you're not gonna hurt him.

489
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,730
<i>Swear it.</i>

490
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,245
<i>All right,
I swear it.</i>

491
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,051
<i>Diana, did you hear that?</i>

492
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,369
I did.
Send me a link to the asset.

493
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,880
If you lie to me,
I will kill you.

494
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,126
I'm not that easy to kill.

495
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,403
He's in Singapore.

496
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,965
The Syndicate headquarters
are in Singapore.

497
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,370
<i>He's hiding in plain sight.</i>

498
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,564
Yes?
<i>It's Diana.</i>

499
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,643
<i>I need you in Singapore
as soon as possible.</i>

500
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,330
I'm on my way.

501
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,011
Yes?

502
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,128
Litvenko's in Singapore.
They're on their way.

503
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,603
They're coming.
Scan every entry point.

504
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,087
Yes, sir.

505
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,201
The Syndicate's tied
to those cameras, isn't it?

506
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,169
They're tied to everything.

507
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,090
Can you hold this, please?
Thank you.

508
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,209
How do you fight against that?

509
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,681
By playing the odds,
doing the unexpected.

510
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,881
Take nothing for granted.

511
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,008
Everything you do
has a reason.

512
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,924
What does that mean?

513
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,007
Jacket. Give me your bag.

514
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,004
Right now,
it means avoid those cameras.

515
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,041
Okay.

516
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,886
I know, that took me too long.

517
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,288
Ask you a question?

518
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,807
Am I going to end up like you?

519
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,881
Bombs?

520
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,526
Moths.

521
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,849
It's Italian wool,
they love it.

522
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,126
Did it hurt?

523
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,924
Yes.

524
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,010
Do you all...?

525
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,845
The barcode is given to us
when we're born.

526
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,761
And the number?

527
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,729
When we become Agents.

528
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,005
He'll be there in the morning
about 9:00.

529
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,168
It's when the orchids
are in full bloom.

530
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,124
You know he's dying.

531
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,891
Lung cancer.

532
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,284
He has to use an inhaler now
to breathe.

533
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,685
Are you human?

534
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,410
It's just that John said

535
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,245
that you're not capable
of fear or remorse.

536
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,528
They've been suppressed.
Is that true?

537
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,163
Yes.
What about love?

538
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,331
I am what I need to be.

539
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,970
What does that mean?

540
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,406
It means that, in this job,

541
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,323
sometimes it's better
not to feel anything.

542
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,209
I'm not talking about the job.

543
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,968
I think you're lying.

544
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,646
I don't believe you can
just turn off fear or love.

545
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,450
I don't believe anyone can.

546
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,648
I mean, you're either a person
or you're something else.

547
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,211
Which is it?

548
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,880
Are you asking me or yourself?

549
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,164
You can't fight who you are,
Katia.

550
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,290
You'll lose.

551
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,971
Is that what happened to you?

552
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,804
You fought what you were
and you lost?

553
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,210
People can change.

554
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,847
Don't put your faith in me.

555
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,209
You'll be disappointed.

556
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,840
I still have a job to do.

557
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,250
Which is?

558
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,446
Right now, I need to sleep.

559
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:39,486
When I get anxious and I can't
sleep, I take things apart.

560
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,770
I'm sorry.

561
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,849
Don't ever do that again.

562
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,686
Were they Syndicate?

563
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,126
No, freelance.

564
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,441
Friends of yours?

565
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,603
So, the Syndicate doesn't know
we're here?

566
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,922
There's an open contract
out on us. What do you think?

567
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,046
Here.

568
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,242
Try not to take this apart.

569
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,281
She smells funny.

570
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,481
Robert, please!

571
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,369
How did they find us
so quickly?

572
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,441
You tell me.

573
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,601
No games.

574
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,330
What makes you think
this is a game?

575
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,244
The cameras in the terminal
didn't see me.

576
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,530
But the one outside,
near the exit, did.

577
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,809
Getting pretty good at this,
aren't I?

578
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,564
No, you're sloppy.

579
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,245
I'm gonna have an attack.

580
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,562
Be a good boy.
Here, take your inhaler.

581
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,804
It'll be all right.

582
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,047
Excuse me.

583
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,120
- Where did you get that?
- I traded it.

584
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,123
For what?
Your knife.

585
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,042
Bring Litvenko and the girl
to me.

586
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,682
You shouldn't have come.

587
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,241
You know who I am?

588
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,085
You are
your mother's daughter.

589
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,327
Why did you leave me?

590
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,844
I wanted you to have no part
of what I was.

591
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,725
I wanted you to live.

592
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,210
You had no right.

593
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,685
To walk away from you?

594
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,728
To turn me into this isolated,
afraid thing that I am.

595
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,325
You had no right.

596
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,570
Walk with me, Katia.

597
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,891
I loved your mother very much.

598
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,650
She was a light
in a very dark world.

599
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,203
And more than anything else,
she wanted a child.

600
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,762
But she was unable.

601
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:53,085
So we broke every rule we had,
and we made you.

602
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,766
We knew
that if you were discovered,

603
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,524
they would take you from us.

604
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,686
So we gave you
the tools to be free.

605
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,448
This isn't freedom.

606
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,967
No, perhaps not, Katia.

607
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,164
But it is necessary
for your survival.

608
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,565
Now, I don't expect you
to understand...

609
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,326
but I do ask that you find it
in yourself...

610
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,723
to forgive an old man
his selfishness.

611
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,484
And if I can't?

612
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,410
You will,
because you are the reflection

613
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,084
of the woman I loved.

614
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,810
I'm ready.

615
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,964
Get it over with.

616
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,684
Do it now.

617
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,881
He's not going to kill you.

618
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,840
Father.

619
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,967
Yes, he will. It's inevitable.

620
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,441
Killing is what
he is programmed to do

621
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,521
and who he is.

622
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,885
Isn't that right, 47?

623
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,249
You're wrong.

624
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:19,166
We determine who we are
by what we do.

625
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,321
You believe...

626
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,767
you have a choice?

627
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,922
I believe
that's what makes us human.

628
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,201
Then it seems...

629
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,328
that you and your brother

630
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,483
have a lot to teach
this old man.

631
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,931
I guess I gave you a family
after all.

632
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,601
Move!

633
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,051
Gotcha.

634
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,361
Seal the building.

635
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,241
Go!

636
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,641
What do they want?

637
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,846
More of me.

638
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,923
Why would anyone want
more of you?

639
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,926
One and two, stay on him.
Three and four, cut him off.

640
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,401
Cut him off.

641
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,360
They're boxed in.
They've got nowhere to go.

642
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,931
Right or left, Katia?

643
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,082
Straight ahead.

644
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,446
Trust me.

645
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,561
Holy shit!

646
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,440
I want this building sealed!

647
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,849
Perhaps you should consider
shooting him.

648
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,010
Subdermal body armor.

649
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,243
What, they actually got that
to work?

650
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,567
Yep.

651
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,606
Drive the fucking car faster!

652
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,006
Faster! Faster!

653
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,446
We're not gonna make it.

654
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,521
Trust me.

655
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,123
I want all units on station.
We take them in the city.

656
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,451
This is never going to end,
is it?

657
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,761
I'm afraid not.

658
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,160
He will never stop.

659
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,321
Who?

660
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,121
Antoine Le Clerq.
The Syndicate's chairman.

661
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,166
What if we killed this
Le Clerq? Would it end then?

662
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,768
You can't.
Maybe not, but you can.

663
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,610
Nobody ever gets close enough
to Le Clerq to kill him.

664
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,763
He never leaves his protected
office. Nobody ever goes in.

665
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,803
He's surrounded at all times
by security.

666
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:02,961
14.

667
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,162
That's how many Agents
have tried.

668
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,288
All are dead.

669
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,248
Help me! Help me!

670
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,090
- Get up!
- I can't walk!

671
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,044
Come on, you can do it!

672
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,571
Get up.

673
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,529
- Sorry.
- I can help.

674
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,681
Take her away from me!

675
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,040
You've got to! Come on!

676
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,122
Take her! Please!

677
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,725
Come on!

678
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,607
Please! Get her out of here!

679
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,131
No! No!

680
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,406
Take her!

681
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,451
Hello, Doctor.

682
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,801
What the fuck did you just do?
We need to go back!

683
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,121
He was all I had.

684
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,281
I have to help him.

685
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,487
You can't.

686
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,251
God, you emotionless
piece of shit!

687
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,970
I should kill you.
Yes, you should.

688
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,122
But you won't,
because you're weak.

689
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,408
You're nothing more
than a scared little girl

690
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,687
whose only real gift...
is running.

691
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,649
Fuck you.

692
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,851
DNA sequences, Doctor?

693
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,447
Adaptive mutation
bacteriophages.

694
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,521
Epistasis rates, transfer RNA?

695
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,841
Come on, Doc.

696
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,047
<i>I don't want to do this.</i>

697
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,489
<i>Believe me, you don't want me
to do this either.</i>

698
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,563
<i>So tell me
what I need to know.</i>

699
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:04,767
<i>Tell me...</i>

700
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:08,970
how to make an Agent.

701
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,326
This shit's experimental, Doc.

702
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,331
I've seen it work...

703
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,811
and believe me when I tell you

704
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,043
you don't wanna be the one
it's working on.

705
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,405
You're a bastard.

706
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,247
I know.

707
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,727
No. You don't.

708
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,443
You're a result
of inferior technologies.

709
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,849
A failed experiment.

710
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,728
An Agent's advantage
is not his body, John Smith.

711
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,530
It's his mind.

712
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:49,244
You will never be
as good as him.

713
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,526
Cook him.

714
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,281
For fuck's sake, Doctor,
give me what I need.

715
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,241
Shit.

716
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,641
Mr. Chairman.

717
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,131
Are you all right?

718
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,970
No, I'm not.

719
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,646
I need the Chairman's detail.
The Chairman is out.

720
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,600
<i>995.</i>

721
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,007
Emergency Services, please.

722
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,282
<i>Can I have your location,
please?</i>

723
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,286
Dose him again.

724
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,601
It could kill him.

725
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,166
Do it.

726
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,289
Oh, fuck it!

727
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,040
That's quite enough,
John.

728
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,811
You can wait outside.
All of you.

729
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,164
It's okay, John.

730
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,764
Petya.

731
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,204
Can you hear me?

732
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,881
I'm going to be completely
honest with you.

733
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,528
I admire you.

734
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:21,082
You've created something unique.

735
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,250
A better human being,
and I want it.

736
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,090
I've bet my wealth,
my company, my reputation...

737
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,409
everything, on the success
of this program,

738
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,681
you understand.

739
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:45,046
Good thing I sold your stock,
then.

740
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,645
You and I aren't so
very different. You know this.

741
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,201
Oh, you're wrong.

742
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,080
People can change.

743
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:57,921
No.

744
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,449
Not people like us.

745
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,405
What you did...

746
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,245
when you chose to play God
can never be undone.

747
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:12,164
You can't run
from what you are.

748
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,765
So, I should...

749
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,442
embrace it?

750
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:20,161
Restart the program
with you at its head?

751
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,010
Yes.

752
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:32,250
You always were
a small man, Antoine.

753
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,323
A derivative thinker, at best.

754
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:43,922
This desperation,
it suits you.

755
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,486
The key to everything...

756
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,164
is in your mind, and you're
going to give it to me.

757
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:08,731
Tell me how to build an Agent.

758
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,807
You don't want an Agent.

759
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:14,720
Then what do I want?

760
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,803
An army.

761
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:21,171
And I won't give it to you.

762
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,522
Then you're going to die.

763
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,331
I'm already dead.

764
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,208
Yes, but what about
your daughter?

765
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,883
You don't have her.

766
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:39,527
Oh, but I will. Eventually.

767
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,402
Give me what I want,
and I'll leave her in peace.

768
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:50,001
I give you what you want,
there will be no peace.

769
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,640
<i>Mr. Chairman.</i>

770
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,521
Where is he?

771
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,250
How did he get
into our system?

772
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,481
<i>I don't know,
Mr. Chairman.</i>

773
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:03,042
I'm assuming by your reaction
that you know who I am.

774
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,725
What do you want?

775
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,201
<i>To make a deal.</i>

776
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,321
You have
nothing I need.

777
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,890
<i>You're wrong.</i>

778
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,725
You want what's inside
Litvenko's head...

779
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,042
<i>but he won't give it to you.</i>

780
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:15,887
<i>I can.</i>

781
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,605
How?

782
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,884
<i>Window.</i>

783
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,244
<i>You want the next generation
of Agents.</i> ..

784
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,964
<i>But you've been looking
in the wrong place.</i>

785
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:35,045
<i>You thought the girl was
merely a way to find Litvenko.</i>

786
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,725
<i>A means to an end.</i>

787
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,409
Truth is...

788
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,089
<i>she is the end.</i>

789
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,605
<i>That's right.</i>

790
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,091
<i>Everything you need...</i>

791
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,611
<i>the strength...</i>

792
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,480
<i>the speed, the intelligence,
is right there.</i>

793
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,570
<i>...locked inside her DNA.</i>

794
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,566
So you want to trade him
for her? Why?

795
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,844
Because I always close
my contracts.

796
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,121
Fuck you.

797
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,802
There's a helipad on the roof.

798
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,561
Get him someplace secure.

799
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,400
Heading back to the safe room.

800
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,846
I want all teams to floor 40.

801
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,640
<i>It's not gonna
be enough, John.</i>

802
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,127
No. You stay with me,
you protect me!

803
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:46,046
<i>So many choices.
And only one right answer.</i>

804
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,610
What's it gonna be?

805
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,489
<i>Emotion or duty?</i>

806
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,200
It was too quick.
Fire was here too quick.

807
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,646
Someone called them
before the crash.

808
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,847
What does that mean?

809
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,888
It means he was never
on that helicopter.

810
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,321
Get them out.

811
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,004
What was your mistake?

812
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,889
I don't make mistakes.

813
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,610
You needed me to know

814
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,966
you were better than me.

815
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:27,401
Where is he?

816
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,246
On the roof.

817
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,361
When this is done,
I will kill you.

818
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,281
Ahhh!

819
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,240
Your mother would be proud.

820
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:10,721
What?

821
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,451
Nothing.

822
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,291
I doubt you'd understand.

823
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,931
It doesn't matter.

824
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,525
We'll find her.

825
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,291
I believe you will.

826
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,841
<i>Confirm target termination.</i>

827
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,800
Target: Le Clerq, Antoine...

828
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,725
terminated.

829
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,770
And the other?

830
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,810
<i>Second target?</i>

831
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:30,803
<i>47?</i>

832
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,043
Le Clerq.

833
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,362
He was your target
the whole time?

834
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,011
Everything you taught me

835
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,287
was just so
you could have a diversion.

836
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:48,920
It was necessary.

837
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,128
What, to kill a single man?

838
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,765
No.

839
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,606
To put a stop to the Agent
Program once and for all.

840
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:00,364
And to set you free.

841
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,801
Your father loved you, Katia.

842
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,886
He understood
that Le Clerq would not rest

843
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:09,962
once he knew who you were.

844
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,641
That he would hunt you down.

845
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:17,011
So he did
what any parent would.

846
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:20,247
He died to save his children.

847
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,249
This is your mission,
isn't it?

848
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:39,648
We determine who we are
by what we do.

849
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,206
There is a building full of
highly trained operatives...

850
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,840
who will be
on their way up here, now.

851
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,126
You're wrong.
There's just one.

852
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,248
