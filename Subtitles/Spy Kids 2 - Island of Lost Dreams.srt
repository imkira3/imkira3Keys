00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,369
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,706
We want to welcome a very special guest
to our park today,

4
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,833
the President's daughter.

5
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:43,959
PHOTOGRAPHER: Big smile.

6
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,087
Hello, Alexandra. Where's your father?

7
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:51,258
He'll be here. I'll make sure of it.

8
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,677
Hey, there, little Miss First Lady,

9
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,722
I'm Dinky Winks,
owner of this fine establishment.

10
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,558
You ready to ride the ride
and shrill to the thrills, spills, and chills?

11
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,642
Yes, I am.

12
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,728
Right this way!

13
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,192
Of course, right behind me,
the world-famous Whippersnapper.

14
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:12,196
Guaranteed to make grown men howl
like a cub wolf at weaning time.

15
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,324
Over on our left,

16
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:21,455
the Nervewracker. (EXCLAIMS)
Painful, but fun.

17
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:27,461
On your other left is,
well, my personal favorite, the Vomiter.

18
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:31,256
Now, we tell people
not to ride it on a full stomach,

19
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,884
but you know folks, they just don't listen.

20
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,932
But why bother with any of those?

21
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,935
You're here for my latest and greatest.

22
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,687
For your personal amusement
and complete gratification,

23
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,273
I humbly offer

24
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,026
the Juggler.

25
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,786
-But is it fast?
-(LAUGHS) Is it fast? Let's see, shall we?

26
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,205
The riders are strapped into the bubble.

27
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,378
The hydrobot lifts
the bubble high into the air.

28
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,047
(MECHANICAL CHUCKLING)

29
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,217
And spins it round and round as fast
as the United States Government will allow.

30
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,224
The bubble spins, turns, flips, and bounces.

31
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,227
(ALL SCREAMING)

32
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,230
And then it juggles you.

33
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,485
(SCREAMING)

34
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,616
I want to go on!

35
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,411
I thought so.

36
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,164
Now, understand,
the override precautions are top-notch,

37
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,374
modified by yours truly.

38
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,543
I thought her father
was supposed to be here.

39
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,086
SECRET AGENT 1 : The President
has more pressing business

40
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,173
than to spend an entire Sunday
in a theme park.

41
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,008
No one's that busy.

42
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,262
Have fun, kid.

43
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,142
We'll take it a little slow, just make it fun.

44
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,482
(GASPS)

45
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,866
-Can't you get her down?
-Somebody's jammed the override.

46
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,327
Why, that little troublemaker.

47
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,289
SECRET AGENT 1 : Remain calm.
Remain calm.

48
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,375
We are the Secret Service.
Everything is under control.

49
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,127
-There's nothing we can do, sir.
-What?

50
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,171
SECRET AGENT 2: The weight of our agents
will prevent us from ascending

51
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,048
the shaky precipice
on which she now stands.

52
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,799
She'll fall.

53
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,843
Don't we have any smaller agents?

54
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,557
Bring me Agents SK1 and SK2.

55
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,684
Coming through. Coming through.

56
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,779
-We're ready.
-Use this, the latest gear.

57
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,447
CARMEN: We get to keep them afterwards?

58
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,324
SECRET AGENT 1 : (STAMMERING) No.

59
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,117
Yes. Of course.

60
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,995
Let's rock.

61
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,041
You're sure they can handle this?

62
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,920
If not, there are two others who can.

63
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,716
Bring me Agents SK3 and SK4 as backup.

64
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,346
We got company.

65
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,645
JUNI: Gary and Gerti.
What are they doing here?

66
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,541
-GARY: Excuse me there, sport.
-Where did you get that?

67
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,543
Latest in electro-riser technology,

68
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,630
with new composite materials
and AI Brainology.

69
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,340
I can see
you don't know what I'm talking about.

70
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,052
-Gary, this is my rescue.
-We'll take it from here.

71
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,556
"Latest gear," my butt.

72
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,768
No, no, no! You'll just make it worse!

73
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,772
Now you done it.

74
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,651
-Over here!
-Get away from me!

75
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,904
-Alexandra, take my hand!
-Back off!

76
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,157
I want my father to come up here
and get me.

77
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,951
But he's the President of the United States.

78
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,703
No, he's my father.

79
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,830
He was my father
before he ever became President,

80
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,957
and he should still be my father now.

81
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,334
I want him up here!

82
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,461
Sir, we have a situation.

83
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,795
She's got the Transmooker.

84
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,299
This is now a code-red situation.
Get her down now!

85
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:46,011
The point is,
you and your father need to have a talk.

86
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,972
Up here may not be the best place.

87
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,517
Come with me, and I promise you,
the two of you will have that talk.

88
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,187
How can you promise that?

89
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,775
I'm Level Two. I can order him to talk to you.

90
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,157
Hi, Gerti.

91
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,326
-What you doing?
-I'm trying to stop the ride.

92
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,703
-Without disengaging the axis?
-Exactly.

93
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,247
Then stop what you're doing.

94
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,167
You see, the ride
is designed to work like a giant magnet.

95
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:22,339
If you reverse the polarization,
bye-bye, President's daughter.

96
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,554
See you around.

97
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,394
-Okay.
-Wait!

98
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,897
I took this from my father's office
this morning.

99
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,358
-I'm sure he'll want it back.
-Careful!

100
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,986
Look, Cortez, you take her down,
and I'll take this down.

101
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,321
That way, we both look good.

102
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,865
I'm not doing this for looks, Gary.

Thank goodness you're all right, Alexandra.

105
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,085
We were worried sick.

106

I think this is what you're looking for.

She swiped it from the President.

109

You're in big trouble this time, missy.

110
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:17,436
Wait a minute.
I promised her she could talk to her father.

111
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,187
She'll talk to him, all right.
We'll make sure of that.

-Promise me one thing.
-What?

No more rinky-dink assignments.

So, you want the Ukata assignment, huh?

same as everyone, same as me.

I know. It's just that we've learned so much.

119
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,803
Juni and I are more
than capable of taking bigger assignments.

00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,055
But that's not your decision to make.

In fact, you're looking cool already. Like me.

this is a very important night for your father.

is located anywhere near there,

320
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:04,019
so these tales were dismissed,
and the agents fired.

321
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,315
However, the magnet ship
that captured the Transmooker device

322
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,111
was last seen in this same area.

323
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:16,574
So, we need a small ship,
piloted by two small agents

324
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,284
to go in and take a closer look.

325

you return, you report it back here.

-We accept.
-We accept.

327
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,543
You bet we accept.

Come home, R.A.L.P.H. Good work.

329
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:36,260
It's a great assignment,
but Gary and Gerti have it, and I'm fired.

-I already did it.

I'd take it one step further.

335

to the Ukata assignment.

-How did you get that?
-GARY: It's all prototype, Juni.

404

You can't be running around
with those mass-produced gadgets.

405

Just means everyone's got them.
I always go with the prototype.

Sure, they're a little buggy, but I can deal.

on my way out of the OSS building.

Sorry about that.

00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,383
How you doing, Minion?

481
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,512
Things are a little Floopy
around here for my taste,

482
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,764
but it's a living.

483
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,434
I need some information
on your favorite subject, the OSS.

484
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,769
I need to make a call.

485
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:12,150
Okay, you ready? Ukata. Transmooker.

486
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,777
WOMAN: The President's daughter
is unavailable.

487
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,945
CARMEN: Manage.

488
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,279
Press one to record.

489
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,864
Mean anything to you?

490
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,992
Smells like the work of Donnagon Giggles.

491
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,412
He had first contact
with the Transmooker technology.

492
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,498
You think Donnagon's the one
behind all this?

493
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:30,377
You're talking to a man with four heads.
Trust me, the guy is dirt.

494
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,878
What should we look for?

495
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:36,633
First, find the island.
Then find the Island Man.

496
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,885
That would have been Donnagon's contact.

497
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,929
Okay. Thanks, Minion.

498
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,265
Be a good girl
and swat your brother for me.

499
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,683
Oh, I will.

(BEEPING)

501
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,146
Something's wrong! Take the wheel!

502
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,772
Got to go. Good luck!

503
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,233
Slow down! We're nearing destination zone.

504
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:57,362
The radius where all the disappearances
occurred is right

505
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,239
here!

506
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,244
We've been shut down!

507
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,247
Hold onto something!

(GROANING)

509
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,887
All power is off, even the emergency power.

510
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,348
My flashlight doesn't even work.

511
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,933
We're stuck, aren't we?

512
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,937
Let's get out of here.

513
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,316
Rebreathers.

514
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,776
Rebreathers.

515
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,695
You got to do it by hand.

516
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,113
What next?

517
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,326
Nope. Hand, Carmen.

518
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,832
Unbelievable.

519
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:52,918
Low-tech!

520
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,343
Here we go.

521
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,080
Should we travel light or heavy?

522
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,457
We may not be coming back down here.

523
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,167
Let's go heavy.

524
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,670
Inflate-a-suits?

525
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,838
We don't have much choice.

526
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,719
At least the masks work.

527
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:49,307
I think it's because they're valve-operated,
not electrical-based.

528
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,310
-It's so strange.
-Good luck.

529
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,062
You, too!

530
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,022
Stay close!

531
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,464
Oh, great. I'm fat!

532
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,508
Was it supposed to do this?

533
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,678
It has an electrical automatic shutoff
which didn't work.

534
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,265
Luckily, we ran out of air
before the suits exploded.

535
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,977
JUNI: Well, we can still laugh.

537
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:40,066

Well, according to my coordinates, we are...

I like your new office. It's smaller, cozy.

548
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,614
Especially smaller.

549
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,700
Oh!

550
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,869
So many successful missions.

551
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,829
Amazing, isn't it?

552
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,581
-Remember this one?
-Oh.

553
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,418
-Which mission is that?
-Mexico.

554
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,836
Of course.

555
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,343
Actually, that was the one mission
we never accomplished.

556
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,721
Ingrid, don't start with your parents again.

557
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,473
It's funny you should mention them.

558
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,310
No. When I mention your parents,
it is the exact opposite of funny.

559
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,230
Doesn't it bother you
that we never got their full blessing?

560
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,481
Frankly, you deserve another chance

-to show them...
-All right, all right.

562

Invite them if you want, but I won't be here.

563
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,321
Tell them that I had to go
on another mission,

564
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,949
that we're having a little problem
on the moon.

My father loves the moon.

You invited them already, didn't you?

you were coming next Tuesday.

808
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,430
it's where the bigger ones are outside?

809
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,892
Correct. I can keep track
of their whereabouts this way.

810
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:40,938
See? The two intruder children
are being chased by a slizzard.

811
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:43,107
-Gary and Gerti.
-Leave 'em.

812
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,316
We have to go help them!

813
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,568
They shouldn't be snooping around
my island to begin with!

814
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,737
-I'm with you, dude.
-We have to help them.

815
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,906
I'm not going out there! I'll be eaten!

816
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,661
What a bizarre man.

GERTI: Help us! Somebody!
GARY: Help!

818
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,501
JUNI: What are you guys doing down there?

819
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,336
That's real funny, clown. Get us out!

820
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,840
We tried to activate our micro grapplers,
but they didn't deploy!

821
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,716
Nothing works here.

822
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,927
Yeah, we know that now.
Thanks for the update, carrot top.

823
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,847
-Juni, come back. They need our help.
-I'll help them.

824
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:20,060
I want to get him back over here
so I can push him back over myself.

825
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,353
-Hurry up.
-Come on.

826
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,606
Here, Gary. Give me your hand.

827
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:27,651
Thank you, Carmen.

828
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,200
Here, Gerti, give me your hand.

829
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,119
Just wait till my father gets here.

830
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,038
Your father's coming?

831
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,421
-Where are you taking me now, Carmen?
-CARMEN: Hold on.

832
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,970
Why are you still hiding?
We're kids, not monsters.

833
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,054
What's the difference?

834
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,640
Relax. They're OSS Agents, as well.

835
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,851
-Level One.
-They're Donnagon's kids.

836
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,394
Agent Donnagon?

837
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,480
You work for the OSS, don't you?

838
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,732
-I work for a man named Donnagon.
-Who is this guy?

839
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,901
Donnagon's not interested
in your creatures.

840
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,027
Why not?

841
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,112
The Transmooker device
that hides your island,

842
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,947
that's what Donnagon really wants.

843
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,324
That's not nearly as interesting.

844
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:19,411
Now that Donnagon's head of the OSS,
he has the power to take it from you.

845
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,913
What are you babbling about now, Juni?

846
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,458
The Transmooker you took
from the President's daughter, Gary.

847
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:25,959
It was just a prototype.

848
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,003
The real Transmooker device
is here on this island.

849
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:31,423
It's even more powerful and can shut down
all technology on the planet.

850
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,760
You said your father's on his way.
I think he's coming to pick it up.

851
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,762
You're all liars.

852
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,139
Do you really think
you're gonna turn us on our own father?

853
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,266
Did your dad tell you
the mission you went on

854
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,185
was just a setup for Carmen and me?

855
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,562
-Why not?
-He has his reasons.

856
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:49,274
That's what being a good spy is all about,
trust no one.

857
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,360
How to Be a Spy, we've read it.

858
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:56,323
Read it again. A good spy makes no binding
connections with family or friends.

859
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,492
I don't believe in that, do you?

860
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,994
GARY: If you want to be a good spy,
you better believe it.

861
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:04,289
My father's a great spy,
so let's grow up, shall we?

862
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:08,001
Whatever my father's done,
it's what it takes to play in the big world.

Like it or not. Come on, Gerti. Let's go.

864

-He's right.
-Why can't you side with me just once?

865
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,887
There are no sides.
You're right, and he's right, too.

866
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,973
That's what being a spy means.

867
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,808
-Well, I don't like it.
-Then quit.

-I will.
-Yeah, right.

Their Dragon Spy doesn't show up
anywhere on radar.

on doing the children's dental work myself?

How could I forget?

875
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:06,351
I installed a nonelectrical tracking device
in their teeth,

my own invention.

you're reading that map correctly?

to Carmen and Juni's current position.

he's saying. Never.

01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:25,271
Not only were we set up,
but I bet Donnagon knew all along

986
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,483
that you'd hack your way
into taking this assignment.

987
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:30,986
I was wondering the same thing.

988
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:35,198
Juni, open up.

989
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,533
What?

990
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:40,578

Now, if Mom and Dad also disappear,

997
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,853
who's gonna stop Donnagon
from using the Transmooker device?

998
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,229
Donnagon wants us all together

999
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:08,857
so he can destroy the island
and all of us with it.

We can't let Mom and Dad find us.

Or Donnagon wins.

A big sacrifice.

What happened? What did you just do?

1006
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:35,133
We lost Carmen.

1007

1019
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:45,286
Ingrid, was Juni wearing
that charm necklace

1020
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,413
I sent him for Christmas last year?

1021

-He never takes it off.
-Then we got him.

1022
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:54,712
I was worried about Juni's well-being,

1023
01:08:55,339 --> 01:09:00,635
so I put a tracer in his necklace.

-There he is.
-Thanks, Dad.

Are you sure
you don't want me to take over the wheel?

Well, well, well,
your friend likes freeze-dried.

1128
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:02,116
So does mine.

1129
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:15,546
All right, buddy. Let's kick their butts.

1130
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:19,258
-We're waiting.
-GARY: Come on.

1131
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:22,553
Can't let you bust up
my dad's machine, Juni.

1132
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,305
JUNI: Whoa!

1133
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:28,893
So I guess I'll just have to bust you up.

1134
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,728
We can take 'em.

1135

JUNI: Come on, buddy. We can take 'em.

1136
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:35,608
I don't think we can take 'em!

1137
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:45,493
Must try and help them. Must.

1138
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:50,831
So, even if your dad is behind all this,
you'd still side with him over what's right?

1139
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,375
Right?

1140
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,335
How do you ever know what's right?

1141
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:58,089
Trust me, when the moment comes,
you'll know.

Show 'em who's boss.

1148
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:21,237
Show 'em who's boss.

1149
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,489
I'm the boss.

Careful, Juni!

1185

If you don't shut it down right,
you can bring the entire world to an end.

-Thanks.
-I'm serious.

Well, we have to shut it down.

This turns that off.

Just stand up against the wall like
a good boy and leave us alone.

Nice try, but we brought friends this time.

Romero. What are you doing
outside of your cage?

Hello, Agents. Warming it up for me?

Are you ready
to cooperate this time, Romero?

You said three switches.

What do we do?

1208

You must bind together
the three toggle switches.

1287
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,538
Uncle Felix, how could you?

1288
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:16,415
I'm not your uncle.

1289
01:28:16,499 --> 01:28:18,125
But we treated you like family.

1290
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:20,961
Donnagon said if I joined him,
he wouldn't get rid of me

1291
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:23,463
like he's gonna do to you guys.

1292
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,382
You can't argue with that.

1293
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:29,469
-Do you still have power in your watch?
-Yep.

1294
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:32,431
-Programming complete, Father.
-Thank you, Gerti.

1295
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:34,474
Try remote-piloting the choppers.

1296
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:41,273
Well, Cortezes, any last words?

1297
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:43,150
None that I can say in front of my children.

1298
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:44,735
Not to mention your mother.

1299
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:57,039
Let's settle this the old-fashioned way.

1300
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:01,626
-Kick his butt!
-Yeah, kick his butt!

1301
01:29:02,253 --> 01:29:03,754
Not like that.

1302
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:06,673

Use his own weight against him.

1307
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:22,939
Yeah.

1308
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:30,572
-Get up!
-Do what I showed you last night!

1309
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:32,032

-Even I can fight better than that.
-Mom.

Triple backflip!

1312
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:09,486

(HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH)

1314
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:13,782
Gerti?

1315
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:16,785
What did you... Why?

1316
01:30:16,869 --> 01:30:19,037
Oh, don't even get me started.

1317
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:23,417
Just wait till Mom finds out
you tried to take over the world again.

1318
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:29,131
No. Please, please, please.
Don't tell your mother. Please?

1319
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,996
DONNAGON: (STAMMERING) Hello.
Hello, there, Mr. President.

1320
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:07,836
By order of the President,
you've been temporarily disavowed.

1321
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:16,803
You're fired.

1322
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:21,141
Looks like I lost this round, but I'll be back.

1323
01:31:21,225 --> 01:31:22,726
Hopefully, you're on the good side
next time.

1324
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:27,105
We'll see, but you never know.

1325
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:33,653
Don't worry.
He gets out of line, I'll straighten him out.

1326
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:35,530
You go, Gerti.

1327
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:43,497
You tried to save us. Why?

1328
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,214
Because you are my family.

1329
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:58,845
You know, there isn't a man on this earth

1330
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:01,932
we'd ever think
would be good enough for our daughter,

-You come pretty close.

1332
01:32:11,442 --> 01:32:15,445
By order of the President,
you are the new director of the OSS.

1333
01:32:16,405 --> 01:32:17,989
Congratulations.

1334
01:32:19,158 --> 01:32:21,243
Do... Are they...

1335
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:29,251
Level One.

1336
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:31,670
No, thanks.

1337
01:32:32,171 --> 01:32:35,131
-You don't want it?
-I'm leaving the OSS.

1338
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:39,344
I've seen what it takes to be a top spy,

1339
01:32:39,428 --> 01:32:45,308
and I think I can be of better use to
the world by just being the best me.

1340
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:48,353
But what about all the cool gadgets?

1341
01:32:48,437 --> 01:32:50,939
I got the best gadget right here.

1342
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:55,360
Use number one, a stylish bracelet.

1343
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:59,072
-See you around?
-Yes.

1344

-"I told you so."

JUNI: Never.

-I am not going out there.
-Yes, you are.

1352
01:34:31,415 --> 01:34:33,124
You're a spy, you're undercover,

1353
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:35,210
and you have to make them
think you're a pop star.

1354
01:34:35,294 --> 01:34:36,836
I can't sing.

my Machete miracle microphone.

What about me?

1360
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:52,769
This'll make you play
like Angus Van Santana.

your gadgets work?

I never put any batteries in this.
